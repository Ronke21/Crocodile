<text>Jeju Province (; ), officially Jeju Special Self-Governing Province (Jeju: ; ), is the southernmost province of South Korea, consisting of eight inhabited and 55 uninhabited islands, including Marado, Udo, the Chuja Archipelago, and the country&#x27;s largest island, Jeju Island. The province is located in the Korea Strait, with the Korean Peninsula to the northwest, Japan to the east, and China to the west. The province has two cities: the capital Jeju City, on the northern half of the island and Seogwipo, on the southern half of the island. The island is home to the shield volcano Hallasan, the highest point in South Korea. Jeju and Korean are the official languages of the province, and the vast majority of residents are bilingual.

Jeju Island was first settled by humans 8,000 to 10,000 years ago and the Tamna Kingdom is the earliest known civilization on the island. Beginning in the 5th century AD, the kingdom would become a tributary state of various Korean Kingdoms and briefly invaded by the Mongol Empire, before being annexed into the Goryeo in 1105 and later Joseon in 1392. Joseon ruled the island brutally and multiple uprisings occurred. Jeju Island, with the rest of mainland Korea, was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910. Following Japan&#x27;s surrender in World War II in 1945, the islands became part of South Jeolla Province in the United States Army Military Government in Korea, before becoming a separate province on August 1, 1946. On July 1, 2006, the islands were designated a Special Self-Governing Province; it is now one of three special self-governing provinces, the others being Gangwon State and Jeonbuk State.

==History==

===Early history===
The earliest known polity on the island was the kingdom of Tamna.

According to the legend, three demigods emerged from Samseong, which is said to have been on the northern slopes of Hallasan and became the progenitors of the Jeju people, who founded the Kingdom of Tamna.

It has also been claimed that three brothers, including Ko-hu, who were the 15th descendants of Koulla, one of the progenitors of the Jeju people, were received by the court of Silla, at which time the name Tamna was officially recognized, while the official government posts of Commander, Prince and Governor were conferred by the court upon the three. However, there is no concrete evidence of when the &quot;Three Names&quot; (Samseong-Ko, Yang and Pu) appeared nor the exact date of when Ko-hu and his brothers were received by Silla. The &quot;Three Names&quot; Founding Period may be assumed to have occurred during the Three Kingdoms (Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla) Period on the mainland of Korea.

Taejo, founder of Goryeo, attempted to establish the same relationship between Goryeo and Tamna as Tamna had had with Silla. Tamna refused to accept this position and the Goryeo court dispatched troops to force Tamna to submit. Ko ja-gyeon, chief of Tamna, submitted to Goryeo in 938 and sent his son, Prince Mallo, to Goryeo&#x27;s court as a de facto hostage. In 1105, (King Sukjong&#x27;s 10th year), the Goryeo court abolished the name Takna, which had been used up to this time and, from that year on, the island was known as &quot;Tamna-gun&quot; (district) and Goryeo officials were sent to handle the affairs of the island.

Tamna-country was changed to Tamna-county in 1153, during the reign of King Uijong and Choi Cheok-kyeong was posted as Tamna-Myeong or Chief of Tamna. During the reign of Gojong of Goryeo, Tamna was renamed &quot;Jeju&quot;, which means &quot;province across the sea&quot;.

In 1271, General Kim T&#x27;ong-jŏng escaped with what remained of his Sambyeolcho force from Jindo and built the Hangpadu Fortress at Kwiil-chon from where they continued their fight against the combined Korean government-Mongolian army, but within two years, faced by an enemy army of over 10,000 troops, the Sambyeolcho was annihilated.

After Mongol invasions of Korea, the Mongol Empire established a base on Jeju Island with its ally, the Goryeo army in (Tamna prefectures) and converted part of the island to a grazing area for the Korean and Mongol cavalry stationed there. After the Sambyeolcho Rebellion was crushed by the Yuan authorities, Tamna prefectures were established and were used to graze horses, until 1356.

In the beginning of the 15th century, Jeju Island was subjected to the highly centralized rule of the Joseon dynasty. A travel ban was implemented for almost 200 years and many uprisings by Jeju Island residents were suppressed. During the Joseon period (1392–1910), Jeju islanders were treated as foreigners and Jeju was considered as a place for horse breeding and exile for political prisoners. In the 17th century, Injo of Joseon issued an edict prohibiting islanders from travelling to the Korean mainland. Consequently, Jeju islanders staged several major uprisings, including the Kang Je Geom Rebellion (1862), Bang Seong Chil Rebellion (1898), and the Lee Jae Su Rebellion (1901).

===Modern history===

====Japanese occupation====
In 1910, Japan annexed Korea, including Jeju, inaugurating a period of hardship and deprivation for the islanders, many of whom were compelled to travel to the mainland or Japan for work. Residents of Jeju were active in the Korean independence movement during the period of Japanese rule. On Jeju, the peak of resistance came in 1931–32 when &quot;haenyeo&quot; (&quot;sea women&quot;) from six eastern villages launched a protest against the Japanese-controlled Divers Association. Before it was brutally crushed, the protests spread and eventually 17,000 people participated, with over 100 arrested in Korea&#x27;s largest protest movement ever led by women and fisheries workers.

====Jeju Uprising, 1948====
On April 3, 1948, against a background of an ongoing ideological struggle for control of Korea and a variety of grievances held by islanders against the local authorities, many communist sympathizers on the island attacked police stations and government offices. The brutal and often indiscriminate suppression of the rebellion resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians and insurgents, and the imprisonment of thousands more in internment camps. 14,000 to 30,000 people were killed in total during the 13 month uprising.

From 3 April 1948 to May 1949, the South Korean government conducted an anticommunist campaign to suppress an attempted uprising on the island. The main cause for the rebellion was the election scheduled for 10 May 1948, designed by the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK) to create a new government for all of Korea. The elections were only planned for the south of the country, the half of the peninsula under UNTCOK control. Fearing that the elections would further reinforce division, guerrilla fighters of the Workers&#x27; Party of South Korea (WPSK) reacted violently, attacking local police and rightist youth groups stationed on Jeju Island.

While claims have been made that the U.S. government oversaw and supported &quot;anti-communist&quot; activities administratively if not openly in the field, this remains unproven. The Northwest Youth League, a Korean government-sponsored watchdog group made up of refugees who had fled North Korea, actively repressed any and all &quot;communist sympathizers&quot; including a policy of shooting anyone entering or leaving the president&#x27;s declared &quot;enemy zone&quot;. This led to the deaths of hundreds of islanders. Many islanders were also raped and tortured. The isolation of Jeju and a cover up by the Korean government led to public ignorance of the Jeju uprising by mainland Koreans for many years. A 1988 documentary by Thames TV, &quot;&quot; and many activities and publications, including Sun-i Samch&#x27;on by Hyun Ki Young, by organizations and persons from within Jeju-do and around the world continue to attempt to shed the light on this event. The Uprising has become a symbol of Jeju&#x27;s Independence from Korean Peninsula.

The provincial administrative building was burned to the ground in September 1948 and a new building was completed in 1-do, 2-dong in December 1952.

In 2008, bodies of victims of a massacre were discovered in a mass grave near Jeju International Airport.

On June 27, 2007, Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes was unanimously made a UNESCO World Heritage site at the 31st World Heritage Committee.

On 11 November 2018, it was announced that preparations were being made for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to visit Jeju during his upcoming visit to South Korea. Kim would be transported to Jeju via helicopter. The announcement came in after 200 tonnes of tangerines harvested in Jeju were flown to North Korea as a sign of appreciation for nearly 2 tonnes of North Korean mushrooms Kim gave to South Korea as a gift, following the September 2018 inter-Korean summit.

In November 2020, South Korean archeologists announced the discovery of a 900-year-old lost slipway off the coast of Sinchangli. Researchers also discovered bright objects, coins and ceramics belonging to the Northern Song dynasty.

==Logo==

The script in the official Jeju logo is colored black, to evoke the basalt of the island, indicating that Jeju&#x27;s traditions should be preserved and developed. The green symbolizes the natural environment of Hallasan and Jeju, blue symbolizes the sea of Jeju, and orange symbolizes the hopeful future and value of Jeju Special Self-Governing Province.

==Administrative divisions==

===Historical===
In 1273, the Mongolian Yuan dynasty established a military governor on the island. For nearly a hundred years the island was effectively under the complete control of these governors.

During the Joseon period, all of the administrative rights and systems of Jeju island, which had maintained some independence until this time, were absorbed into the centralized form of government established by Joseon.

In 1402, the titles of Commander and Prince were abolished. In 1416, the island was divided into three major administrative districts: the area lying generally north of Hallasan was headed by a &#x27;Moksa&#x27; or county magistrate, while the eastern area of Jeongui-county (today&#x27;s Seongeup Folk Village) and the southwestern area of Daejeong-county (today&#x27;s Moseulpo, Daejeong-eup, and Sanbangsan) were each headed by a Hyeon-gam (also county magistrate).

In August 1864, both Jeongui and Daejeong hyeons were removed from the control of the &#x27;moksa&#x27; north of the mountain in today&#x27;s Jeju-si area and were renamed &#x27;Gun&quot; (county) and came under the direct control of the Gwanchalsa (governor) of Jeolla province. Because of strife between these &#x27;Guns&#x27; and the Jeju &#x27;moksa&#x27;, the system was abolished in January 1880, and the two &#x27;Guns&#x27; reverted again to &#x27;hyeon&#x27;.

In 1895, Jeju-mok was redesigned as Jeju-Bu with a governor (Gwanchalsa) and Vice-governor (Chamsagwan) and a police agency was newly established, while in both Jeongui and Daejeong the offices of &#x27;Gunsu&#x27; (county chief) were re-established. The very next year, the office of &#x27;Gunsu&#x27; was abolished and the old system was restored.

Then in 1906, abolishing the Moksa system altogether, the Gunsu or County chief system was adopted. In 1910, Jeongui and Daejeong were included in Jeju gun while Chuja-myeon was placed under the jurisdiction of Wando-gun, part of South Jeolla province.

===Modern===
Japan annexed Korea in 1910. In 1915, the &quot;gun&quot; or county system that had been adopted in 1906 was abolished and Jeju island was designated as part of the &#x27;island&#x27; system and called Jeju myeon under South Jeolla province. In 1931, Jeju-myeon was raised to the status of Jeju-eup or &#x27;township,&#x27; which gave the island one township (today&#x27;s Jeju-si area) and 12 &#x27;myeon&#x27;. In 1945, Japan relinquished sovereignty over Korea and on September 1, 1955, Jeju Township was elevated to city status with 40 administrative wards, which, on January 1, 1962, were reduced to 14 wards. On July 8, 1956, Seogwi, Daejeong and Hallim-myeons were raised to the status of townships while the southwestern portion of Hallim Township was separated and newly designated as the Hankyeong district (myeon), which gave the province one city, two counties, three townships and 10 myeon or districts with 14 wards in Jeju City. May 23, 1979, saw the restructuring of the Jeju-si wards and the addition of three more, giving 17 wards.

In March 1980, the construction of a new provincial office was started in Yeon-dong of Jeju-si and in December of that year the four myeon of Aewol, Gujwa, Namwon and Seongsan were elevated to the status of townships giving the administrative area one city, two counties, seven townships, six districts and, within Jeju-si, 17 wards.

In 1981, the development of the Jungmun Tourist Complex brought about the unification of Seogwi township and Jungmun-myeon (district) into one as Seogwipo consisting of 12 wards (dong) giving the province two cities, two counties, six townships, five districts and 29 wards. On October 1, 1983, Jeju-si&#x27;s Samdo ward was divided into two wards to give a total of 30 wards in the province.

Yongdam ward in Jeju-si was restructured into Yongdam ward one and Yongdam ward two on October 1, 1985. On April 1, 1986, Jocheon myeon (district) was elevated to the status of Township and Yeonpyeong-ri Gujwa township was raised to the status of Udo district (myeon). The provincial area now administered 2 cities, 2 counties, 7 townships, 5 districts and 31 wards, the status of the province as of December 3, 1996.

===Current===

Until 2005, Jeju Province was divided into two cities (&quot;si&quot;), Jeju and Seogwipo, and two counties (&quot;gun&quot;), Bukjeju (North Jeju), and Namjeju (South Jeju), respectively. The two cities were further divided into thirty-one neighborhoods (&quot;dong&quot;). In contrast, the two counties were split into seven towns (&quot;eup&quot;) and five districts (&quot;myeon&quot;). The seven cities and five districts were then divided into 551 villages (&quot;ri&quot;).

In 2005, Jeju residents approved, by referendum, a proposal to merge Bukjeju County into Jeju City, and Namjeju County into Seogwipo. Effective July 1, 2006, the province was also renamed Jeju Special Self-Governing Province with two minor subdivisions, Jeju City and Seogwipo. In addition to the changes in name, the province was given extensive administrative powers that had previously been reserved for the central government. This is part of a plans to turn Jeju into a &quot;Free International City&quot;.

Jeju, on July 1, 2006, was made into the first Self-Governing Province of South Korea.

====Naming====
In Korean, &quot;do&quot; is the phonetic transcription of two distinct &quot;hanja&quot; (Chinese characters) meaning &quot;island&quot; (島) and &quot;province&quot; (道). However, Jejudo generally refers to the island, while Jeju-do refers to the government administrative unit. The table below also includes the name of Jeju City, the provincial capital.

====National Assembly constituencies====
Jeju is represented by 3 constituencies in the National Assembly of South Korea: Jeju-gap, Jeju-eul (in Jeju City) and Seogwipo.

===Cities===
===Symbols===
*Provincial flower: Rhododendron (&quot;Rhododendron Weyrichii&quot; / Max &quot;(Chamkkot)&quot;)
*Provincial tree: Camphor Laurel (&quot;Cinnamomum camphora&quot; siebold / &quot;Noknamu&quot;)
*Provincial bird: Woodpecker (&quot;Dendrocopos leucotos quelpartensis&quot;)

==Geography==
==Society and culture==
=== &quot;Dol hareubang&quot; ===
&quot;Dol hareubang&quot; () are statues that were placed in front of gates as symbolic projections of power and guardians against evil spirits. They have also become symbols and ritual objects for fertility; there are rituals involving the noses of the statues being touched or consumed to improve fertility. They have since become widely adopted as symbols of Jeju Island. It is unclear when they first began to be made; there are attestations to statues similar to them from around 500 years ago, in the early Joseon period. There are 47 pre-modern &quot;dol hareubang&quot; remaining. Modern versions of the statues have been created, with some being sold as tourist goods.

=== &quot;Doldam&quot; ===

&quot;Doldam&quot; refers to the traditional use of piled volcanic stones, often without any adhesives between them, on Jeju Island. Various structures, namely walls around fields (called &quot;batdam&quot;) are created. It is considered a skill to be able to create a resilient &quot;doldam&quot; structure, using only gravity and the angular shapes of the rocks, that can resist Jeju&#x27;s strong winds. Such structures can be found throughout Jeju, and are used for a wide variety of purposes.

==== &quot;Bangsatap&quot; ====
&quot;Bangsatap&quot; are ritual &quot;doldam&quot; structures meant to ward off evil spirits and misfortune. They are usually around tall, and usually have an object placed on top (usually a wood or stone sculpture of a bird or a person). They are generally placed in communities, in an area determined by &quot;feng shui&quot; or placed where misfortune was thought to be likely. A 2022 news article claimed that 49 pre-modern &quot;bangsatap&quot; were left on the island, although before the mid-20th century they were considered to be widespread.

=== &quot;Jeongnang&quot; ===
&quot;Jeongnang&quot; are traditional entrance gates to private homes on the island. The gates are typically composed of three parallel wooden poles placed in holes in wood or stone pillars. They have a number of purposes, one of which is to quickly communicate to neighbors where the owner of the house is. If all three poles are lowered on one side, the owner of the house is at home. Raising poles expresses degrees of how far away from home the owner is; three raised poles indicates that the owner will be gone for a long time. &quot;Jeongnang&quot; have become increasingly less common, especially as more Jejuans have moved into apartments. In spite of this, the practice is still maintained in rural areas.

=== Matriarchical family structure and &quot;haenyeo&quot; ===
Another distinct aspect of Jeju is the matriarchal family structure, found especially in Udo and Mara, but also present in the rest of the province. The best-known example of this is found among the &quot;haenyeo&quot; (&quot;sea women&quot;), who were often the heads of families, because they controlled the income. They earned their living from freediving, often all year round in quite cold water without scuba gear, in order to harvest abalones, conches, and a myriad of other marine products. It is thought that women are better at spending all day deep-water diving because they resist the cold better. In the early 1960s, 21% of women on the island were free divers, providing 60% of the island&#x27;s fisheries revenue. However, because of rapid economic development and modernization, only about 4,500 haenyeo, most aged over 60, were still actively working.

=== Controversies ===

====Jeju Naval Base====
In 1993, South Korea began planning a naval base on Jeju Island. In June 2007, Gangjeong, a village on the southern coast of the island, was selected as the site of the $970 million naval base. Construction started in Gangjeong village in 2007, with planned completion by 2011. The base was designed to be a mixed military-commercial port similar to those in Sydney and Hawaii, that could accommodate 20 warships and three submarines, as well as two civilian cruise ships displacing up to 150,000 tons. Its official name is the &quot;Jeju Civilian-Military Complex Port&quot;. Jeju residents, environmentalists, and opposition parties opposed the construction claiming that environmental hazards will damage the &quot;Island of Peace&quot; designated as such by the government. Villagers have protested and filed lawsuits to try to block construction and have widely publicized their opposition. The protests caused delays in the construction. The base was completed in 2016.

====Refugees on Jeju Island====
In 2018, 500 refugees fleeing the civil war in Yemen came to Jeju Island, causing unease and racial tensions among the residents of Jeju Island.

==Demographics==
Jeju Province is the least populous province in South Korea; at the end of September 2020, the total resident registration population is 672,948, of which 4,000 of the total provincial population reside on outlying islands such as the Chuja Islands and Udo. The total area of the province is .

===Religion===

According to the census of 2005, of the people of Jeju 32.7% follow Buddhism and 17.5% follow Christianity (10.3% Protestantism and 7.2% Catholicism). 49.8% of the population is mostly not religious or follows Korean Shamanism.

==Sports==
===International competitions===
Jeju Island served as one of the host cities of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, with matches hosted at Jeju World Cup Stadium. Jeju City hosted the AIBA 2014 Women&#x27;s World Boxing Championships at the Halla Gymnasium.

===Association football===
Jeju SK (known as Jeju United prior to 2025) is the only professional sports club on Jeju-do. They were the runners-up of the K League in 2010.

==Cuisine==
Jeju Island is the southernmost and largest island isolated from the Korean peninsula. Due to its lack of fresh water, paddy farming is only done on a small scale, with the cultivation of cereal crops such as millet, barnyard millet, buckwheat, and barley being the main feature of agriculture. Therefore, the traditional Jeju meal generally consists of &quot;japgokbap&quot;, which is a bowl of steamed multiple grains as a main dish, with salted dried fish called &quot;jaban&quot; as banchan (side dishes), and a soup based on &quot;doenjang&quot; (soybean paste) such as &quot;baechuguk&quot; made with Napa cabbage, &quot;kongnipguk&quot; made with soybean leaves, or &quot;muguk&quot; made with radish. Jeju dishes are made with simple ingredients, and the taste is generally salty.

Raw seafood called &quot;hoe&quot; is commonly consumed as a part of the meal. The warm weather affects Jeju cuisine in that &quot;gimjang&quot;, preparing kimchi in late autumn for winter consumption, is not necessary to Jeju, as it is in the other provinces. Only a small amount of kimchi is pickled by Jeju locals. Representative main dishes in Jeju cuisine are porridge made with fish, seafood, seaweed, or mushrooms. Examples include &quot;jeonbokjuk&quot; made with abalone, &quot;okdomjuk&quot; made with red tilefish, &quot;gingijuk&quot; (Jeju: 깅잇죽/겡잇죽; ) made with small crabs called &quot;bangge&quot; (&quot;Helice tridens&quot;), &quot;maeyeoksae juk&quot; made with young miyeok () (wakame), and &quot;chogijuk&quot; made with shiitake.

Gamgyul is a type of orange similar to the Mandarin orange or tangerine, commonly harvested in Jeju island. Black pig is a delicacy on the island as well. Black pigs are famous for their black hair and their meat for its chewy texture. The meat is nutritious and does not have the unique smell of pork. Black pigs&#x27; other notable features are their long faces, narrow snouts and small ears that stand up. Horse meat is also a delicacy of the island.
==Myths and legends==
Within the Jeju province, numerous mythological tales and legends remain particularly prevalent; these are encompassed by the word &quot;yetmal&quot; (), responsible for conveying the entirety of the substance of a myth or folk tale, which, within the large majority of instances, occurs within the form of a proverb or philosophical statement. The aforementioned stories remain disseminated within the form of prose between speaker and listener, constituting oral tradition; each story contains a component of truth derived from events within the Jeju province. A. This fictional story could be oral literature but in the eye of ideological aspect, the story also becomes a philosophy. These stories may be classified as proverbs, philosophical statements or folklore derived from the history of the island.

The characteristics of the stories of Jeju Province can be found within the form of natural and historical legend; for instance, within the &quot;Ahunahopgol&quot; legend (), historical circumstances responsible for a lack of individuals with talent within leadership remains displayed, expressing the geometrical destiny perspective. The historical legends of the province generally concerned an individual of particular strength; however, the limitations of the island remain represented within the form of the alternative to the hero, the starving strong man. A primary example remains the &quot;malmurlee&quot; legend (); This kind of story shows the limit of the people of the province, with the primary character remaining born as a strong hero as previously listed, yet remaining incapable of overcoming historical isolation.

A particular example of mythology within the province remains the myth of &quot;Seolmundae Halmang&quot;, well known within Jeju; according to this myth, Seolmundae Halmang (&quot;Grandmother Seolmundae&quot;) could reach from Seongsan Ilchulbong (&quot;Sunrise Peak&quot;, a volcanic tuff cone on the seaboard of Jeju Island) to Guan Tal island at Aewol-eup in a single stride and to Hallasan within 2 strides. She was very strong, possessed 500 children and built Hallasan with seven scoops of earth. One day, Seolmundae Halmang was making soup for her sons while they were out hunting; while they were gone, she fell into the pot and drowned. On their return, they hungrily ate the soup, without knowing that it contained their mother; however, the youngest son knew, informing the remainder of the family, with the entirety of the family crying and transforming into 500 stones.

==Economy==
The Jeju economy has traditionally been supported by primary industry, agriculture and fishing, but tourism has taken a more and more important role as the island receives ten million visitors per year. These are mostly Korean mainlanders but through the opening of the 2010 decade hundreds of thousands of Chinese tourists have been arriving and the number is increasing.

In 2006, the GDP of the province was projected at 8.5 trillion won (about US$8.5 billion), approximately 15 million won per capita. The provincial government&#x27;s budget for 2006 was projected at 1.1 trillion won, an increase of 10% over 2005.

Jeju is also a home for key functions of Daum Communications, a leading Korean internet site, and sole owner of Lycos until August 2010.

Jeju is also famous for hosting many conferences and international meetings, including the World Scout Conference in July 2008. Jeju has its own international convention center called ICC Jeju. The ASEAN-KOREA Commemorative Summit 2009 was held at ICC Jeju.

In 2010, the South Korean federal government tasked Jeju Island to develop itself as an international Meetings, Incentives, Conferencing, Exhibitions destination, and since then, the island has hosted a number of notable events such as the 10,000-passenger China Baozhen Group incentive and 8,000-passenger Amway South Korean incentive. In 2010, the destination welcomed 67 events, enabling it to reach 27th spot globally and seventh in Asia in the UIA ranking of global meetings destinations.

==Tourism==
Tourism commands a large fraction of Jeju&#x27;s economy. In 2018, it was reported that Jeju&#x27;s service industry was around 73.7% of the island&#x27;s GRDP. Jeju&#x27;s temperate climate, natural scenery, and beaches make it a popular tourist destination for South Koreans as well as visitors from other parts of East Asia. The island is sometimes called &quot;South Korea&#x27;s Hawaii&quot;. Tourism on the island is promoted by the South Korean government–backed corporation Jeju Tourism Organization.

The most popular tourist spots on the island are Cheonjeyeon and Cheonjiyeon waterfalls, Hallasan, Hyeobje cave, and Hyeongje island. There is a variety of leisure sports that tourists can take part in Jeju including golf, horse riding, hunting, fishing, mountain climbing, etc. Depending on the season, Jeju hosts many festivals for tourists including a penguin swimming contest in winter, cherry blossom festival in spring, the midsummer night beach festival in summer, and Jeju horse festival in autumn, among others. For most tourists, traffic to and from the island is mainly taken through Jeju International Airport and transport within the island by rental cars. Some local products are popular with tourists, including Jeju&#x27;s special tile fish and mandarin oranges, as well as souvenirs and duty-free shopping.

Jeju was chosen as one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature through the New 7 Wonders of Nature campaign by the New7Wonders Foundation. The campaign saw hundreds of millions of votes and the top seven wonders were announced on 11/11/11.

Museums on the island include Nexon Computer Museum.

===Tourism===

In 1962, the South Korean government established the Korean National Tourism Corporation (KNTC) to monitor and regulate internal and external tourism, and it was later renamed the Korean National Tourism Organization (KNTO). While Korea lacks abundant natural resources, tourism is an entity that generates income nationwide for South Korea. In Jeju-do province, specifically, tourism has proven to be beneficial and has been a growing contributor to the economy. Jeju Island, often compared to Hawaii, &quot;is the winter destination for Asian tourist seeking warm weather and beautiful beaches.&quot;

The island is home to 660,000 people, but hosts 15,000,000 visitors per year. English is not widely spoken in Jeju, and as a matter of fact, &quot;the local dialect is different enough from Korean that it is recognized as a distinct language.&quot; &quot;Until recently, Chinese travelers accounted for 80% of foreign travelers&quot;; however, due to the installation of THAAD (The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) system in Korea, Chinese travel has dwindled drastically. &quot;THAAD is supposed to shield against North Korean missiles&quot; however China views it as a security threat. Though in the past year [2017] tourism has declined sharply, visits to Jeju continue to be a vacation destination for Asia. There are no visa requirements for visitors staying up to 90 days and future plans to build a second international airport have been discussed. Due to the decline of visitors caused by China&#x27;s travel ban to Korea due to the concern of THAAD, talks and discussions continue to be held regarding a second airport to service over 45 million people with an anticipated completion by 2035. The current Jeju International Airport is crowded, as it services &quot;30 million, which is 4 million more than it was designed to handle.&quot; The current desire of the existing Jeju International Airport includes wanting to add more direct flights, nonstop to major cities including Tokyo, Osaka, Beijing, Shanghai, and Taipei.
While the economy booms with foreign travel, residents suffer negative repercussions of Jeju tourism. &quot;Most commercial facilities are owned by foreigners and major companies.&quot; In addition to increasing tourism, issues such as beach pollution, traffic, and overconsumption of underground water present a problem.

Due to extensive tourism, the pollution of beaches has become a serious problem. The local government of Jeju aspires to be carbon-free by 2030. &quot;Nearly half of all-electric cars in South Korea are registered in Jeju&quot;.

In addition to the aspirations of an additional airport and the expansion of tourism on the island, Jeju is home to a small technological hub. In 2005, the Jeju Science Park was created, a complex for technology companies and organizations. Since its implementation, it has attracted 117 IT and biotech companies and is home to the Daum Kakao Corporation headquarters.

Jeju became more well known outside Korea after two characters in the 2021 Netflix original series &quot;Squid Game&quot; mentioned it. It was also the location for two episodes of the 2022 Netflix original series &quot;Extraordinary Attorney Woo&quot;, entitled &quot;The Blue Night of Jeju I and II&quot;.

====Tourist attractions====


Hallim Park is one of the oldest and most popular tourist attractions on Jeju. It is on the west coast.

There is an annual fire festival on the island that stems from a custom of removing harmful insects and old grass in villages in winter. The fire festival is held on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. Dal-gip (to pile up much wood) is burned when the moon rises while praying for good harvests and making good wishes. Jeju traditional food is eaten at the site of the festival. This festival was held 13 times until 2009. The &quot;Jeju Jeongwol Daeboreum Fire Festival&quot; started in 1997 and become a leading festival of Jeju. This takes place in Saebyeol Oreum in Bongseong ri, Aewol Eup. It takes up to 25 minutes to reach it from Jeju International Airport by car. Jeju citizens do their utmost to prepare the Fire Festival so as to pass down, develop, and ultimately develop branding for the unique folk culture resources of Jeju.

Saebyeol oreum has a characteristic of a complex volcano. It has a horseshoe-shaped crater that is both very wide and slightly split. It rises high with the little peaks making an oval from the south peak to northwest. The scale is above sea level , height of , circumference of , area of . Saebyeol oreum is the middle size among the 360 oreums on Jeju island. It is named after the saying &quot;it brightens like a star.&quot;

Olle is a word in the local dialect that refers to the paths between houses and public roads.

The Jeju Olle Trail, called Jeju Olle Gil or simply &quot;jejuolle&quot; in Korean, is a long-distance footpath on Jeju Island. The course, mostly following the coastline, consists of 21 connected, numbered main courses, 5 major spurs, and a short spur that connects to Jeju Airport. The courses have an average length of and all together total . The exact length and locations change over time as trails are modified or re-routed.

The courses pass through small villages, cross beaches, wind through farms and orchards, twist through forests, and climb oreums (&quot;low parasitic volcanoes&quot;) across Jeju Island.

Manjanggul is one of the longest lava tubes in the world. Manjang Cave, at Donggimnyeong-ri, Gujwa-eup, North Jeju, east of Jeju City, was designated as Natural Monument No. 98 on March 28, 1970. The annual temperature inside the cave ranges from 11 °C to 21 °C, thus facilitating a favorable environment throughout the year.

The cave is academically significant as rare species live in the cave. Created by spewing lava, &quot;the lava turtle&quot;, &quot;lava pillar&quot;, and &quot;wing-shaped wall&quot; look like the work of the gods. It is considered to be a world-class tourist attraction.

The Geomunoreum lava tube system is the most impressive and significant series of protected lava tubes in the world and includes a spectacular array of secondary carbonate speleothems (stalactites and other formations). It overwhelms other lava tubes with its abundance and diversity. The Geomunoreum lava tube system, which is regarded as the finest such cave system in the world, has an outstanding visual impact even for those experienced with such phenomena. It displays the unique spectacle of multi-colored carbonate decorations adorning the roofs and floors, and dark-colored lava walls, partially covered by a mural of carbonate deposits.

In addition, lava tubes are like those in limestone karst in scale, shape, and internal decoration, but completely different in origin. Lava tubes are known from basaltic terrain in most of the world&#x27;s volcanic regions. The lava tubes of the Geomunoreum system are, however, regarded as internationally important due to their length, massive volume, intricate passage configuration, well preserved internal lava features, abundant and spectacular secondary carbonate formations, ease of access, and their scientific and educational values. Another feature making Geomunoreum globally significant and distinctive is the presence of carbonate deposits and formations. Very small deposits of calcite are common in lava tubes and are more significantly developed as speleothems in Duck Creek cave in the U.S. state of Utah. However, in abundance, density and diversity they are far less impressive than those of Yongcheongul and Dangcheomuldonggul lava tubes in Jeju, and the scale of these decorations within the lava caves of Jeju Island far exceeds any other comparable examples. The nomination is supported by the Commission on Volcanic Caves of the International Union of Speleology — the world&#x27;s most authoritative scientific body on volcanic caves — which regards Jeju&#x27;s lava caves as being of the highest international ranking. Yongcheon Gul Lava Tube has been discovered subsequently and is of equivalent value.
Sangumburi Crater is the crater of an extinct volcano. Unlike its brethren Halla-san and Songsan Ilch&#x27;ubong, this one exploded quickly but did not spew much lava nor did it form much of a surrounding cone. This phenomenon is called maru in Korean, and Sangumburi is the only one of its kind in the country, making it Natural Monument #263. The remaining crater is deep and an average of s across. Over 400 species of plants and animals live inside the crater.

Visitors can walk around part of the rim (the rest is private property and fenced off), but they cannot venture down inside the crater. A well-paved path leads from the parking area to the viewing area, which has a small pavilion and several vista points. Also on the grounds are gravesites made in traditional Jeju fashion: a wide, trapezoidal stone wall surrounding the burial mound. Several of the sites have small stone figures that guard the mound against evil spirits. At the park entrance are large rocks from the crater. During the eruption, molten rock flew from the volcano into the air and cooled into many exotic shapes.

Seongsan Ilchulbong, also called &#x27;Sunrise Peak&#x27;, is an archetypal tuff cone formed by hydrovolcanic eruptions upon a shallow seabed about 5,000 years ago. On the eastern seaboard of Jeju Island and said to resemble a gigantic ancient castle, this tuff cone is 182 meters high, has a preserved bowl-like crater, and displays diverse inner structures resulting from the sea cliff. These features are considered to be of geologic worth, providing information on eruptive and depositional processes of hydromagnetic volcanoes worldwide as well as past volcanic activity of Seongsan Ilchulbong itself.

Oedolgae is a 20-meter-tall pillar-shaped rock in Sammaebong, Seogwipo. It was created 1.5 million years ago by a volcanic eruption. At the top of Oedolgae, there are pine trees growing naturally. According to legend, an old woman became a rock after waiting for her husband who went to sea to catch fish and didn&#x27;t return for a long time. So people call it &#x27;halmang bawi&#x27; meaning grandmother rock. On the left side of Oedolgae, there is a rock called someri bawi. A large grass area covers the rock, and the surrounding area is great for fishing. Oedolgae is a popular tourist destination, particularly with foreigners.

Hallasan is the mountain of one of the three gods. It stands at the center of Jeju Island, spreading east and west. The east face is steep, the north side is gentle, and the east and west form a flat, wide highland. Hallasan is a dormant volcano created by volcanic activities during the quaternary period of the Cenozoic era. It is primarily covered with basalt. On its top is a crater and Baeknok Lake. This mountain is home to alpine plants and houses as many as 1,800 species of flora. It also boasts luxuriant natural forests and vast grasslands.

The long Road 5.16 crossing the eastern waist of the mountain from Jeju City to Seogwipo is considered to be one of the best tourist roads in Korea. Along this road, there are many tourist attractions such as Sancheondan and Seongpanak. People can enjoy the royal azalea blossoms in spring, lush, green woods in summer, colorful foliage in fall, and a landscape of snow in winter.

The Road 110 crossing the western waist of the mountain from Jeju-si to Jungmun runs through a high area that is high above sea level. It passes by the Eoseungsang Reservoir, which is a source of water for Jeju islanders. The 99 Passes where, a legend says, neither a king nor a tiger is born because it is one short to 100 passes. It also passes closely by Youngsil Giam (Youngsil Grotesque Rocks). It is possible to climb up to Wetse Oreum along Eorimok Trail and Youngsil Trail and to the top along Seongpanak Trail and Kwaneumsa Temple Trail.

Udo, (also called U-island, since do means island) is on the northeast of Seongsan-ri, 3.5 kilometres (2.2 miles) off the coast. This is the largest of the islands included in Jeju-si. Udo, literally &quot;Cow Island&quot; in Chinese, has this name because it looks like a cow lying down. The whole of Udo is a lava plateau and a fertile flatland where major agricultural products such as sweet potatoes, garlic, and peanuts are produced. There is a parasitic cone, called &quot;shoi meori oreum&quot;, in the southeast.

Jungmun Saekdal Beach is at the Saekdal-dong, Seogwipo. It is near the hotel zone it has convenient accessibility: Sinla Jeju hotel, Lotte hotel, Jeju Hana hotel are around 2 kilometers near the beach. Jungmun Saekdal Beach has a particular geographical feature. The beach shore is faced to the north and the water level is steady knee height until about 200 meters off the shore. There are many big and small waves under the influences of the Maparam (, which means the wind from the north in Korean) so the beach is clouded by the people who came from many other regions to enjoy surfing in summer.

Aqua Planet Jeju　In Seogwipo, there is the largest public aquarium &quot;Aqua Planet Jeju&quot; () in South Korea. Korea&#x27;s largest tank of &quot;The Sea of Jeju&quot; is popular.

Jeju has three UNESCO World Heritage sites, and is &quot;packed with museums and theme parks and also has horses, mountains, lava tube caves, and waterfalls with clear blue ocean lapping its beaches.&quot; The Haenyeo (Jeju female divers) harvest oysters, abalone, clams, seaweed and other marine life, and their history is showcased at the island&#x27;s Haenyeo museum.

One of the most popular surfing spots in Korea, Jeju Island is also the birthplace of Korean surfing. Some famous beaches are Weoljung Beach and Jungmun Beach. The latter is home to the first surfing club in Korea, established in 1995.

There are small islands near Jeju Island that visitors can visit by boat; the most famous of these are Udo, Gapado, and Marado. Udo is famous for its peanut ice cream and boat tours.

Jeju has an independent visa policy that varies from that of the South Korean mainland. So all ordinary passport holders excluding those from Afghanistan, Cuba, Ghana, Iraq, Kosovo, Libya, Nigeria, Palestine, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, Somalia and Yemen can stay visa-free 30 days in Jeju, even if they normally require a visa for the South Korean mainland.
Domestic flights from the mainland do not require identification; however, passengers who try to enter the mainland from Jeju must bring identification such as National ID Card, Jeju Resident Card, South Korean drivers licence issued by National Police Agency or or passport with proper visa or visa-free passport or passport with valid United States visa.

Thus, all ordinary passport holders except the following can stay visa-free 30 days in Jeju Province, even if they normally require a visa for South Korea:

Tourists from China do not require a visa to visit Jeju, unlike the rest of South Korea, and in the 2010s have started visiting on specialised package tours to acquire a South Korean driver&#x27;s license; the test is similar to that in China, but can be completed in less time and is easier, application and test forms are available in many languages, and a South Korean license, unlike a Chinese license, makes the holder eligible for an International Drivers License.

==Health==

In 2002, scarlet fever was reported to be in Korean children in Jeju Province. Scientists have been doing research on the matter by creating an age-period-cohort (APC) analysis to back up their relevant hypotheses regarding this emerging outbreak. The Korean National Health Insurance Service analyzed this data from the nationwide insurance claims. Their calculations of the crude incidence rate (CIR) and applying the intrinsic estimator (IE) for age and calendar groups revealed that a total of 2,345 cases of children had the fever that was one of the top illnesses. It also led to the discovery that children aged 0–2 were the most common victims of the fever and that it was mostly boys rather than girls that carried it. The CIR decreased with age between 2002 and 2016 and the age period effect decreased in all observed years. The IE coefficients validating a cohort effect went from negative to positive in 2009. To this day, no one can explain how these children in Jeju Province had scarlet fever, but results suggest that it might be explained through the cohort effect. Further descriptive epidemiological studies are needed to test children that are born after 2009, to determine whether they have the fever or not.

Studies show that Jeju Province is recorded as the region showing the highest incidence of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in South Korea. Just like the scarlet fever, the goal of this study was to determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SFTS patients in Jeju Province. The data that was collected on this situation were obtained by the Integrated Diseases and Health Control System of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDCIS). 55 residents of Jeju were selected to test the criteria at KCDCIS and confirm the cases of SFTS with a residence listed in Jeju Province at the time of diagnosis, between July 16, 2014, and November 30, 2018. Results show that of the 55 confirmed cases of SFTS, the case fatality rate was 10.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 22.2). The most common symptoms of the SFTS were severe fever, myalgia, and diarrhea. There have been fatality rates of 83.6% (95% Cl, 71.2 to 92.2), 45.5% (95% Cl, 32.0 to 59.5), and 40.0% (95% CI, 27.0 to 54.1). This particular study from 2014 to 2018, has been proven to have a lower case fatality rate and a lower incidence of severe fever, myalgia, and confusion than that of the cases nationwide of 2013–2015.

==Utilities==
The island&#x27;s power grid is connected to mainland plants by the HVDC Haenam–Cheju, and electricity is also provided by generators located on the island. As of 2001, there were four power plants on Jeju, with more under planning and construction. The most notable of these are the gas-fired generators of Jeju Thermal Power Plant, located in Jeju City. The present-day generators of this plant were constructed from 1982 onwards, replacing earlier structures that dated from 1968. As elsewhere in Korea, the power supply is overseen by the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO).

In February 2012, the governor of the state of Hawaii (US), Neil Abercrombie, and the director of the Electricity Market and Smart Grid Division at the Korea Ministry of Knowledge Economy, Choi Kyu-Chong, signed a letter of intent to share information about Smart Grid technology. The Jeju Smart Grid was initially installed in 6,000 homes in Gujwa-eup and is being expanded. South Korea is using the pilot program of the Smart Grid on Jejudo as the testing ground in order to implement a nationwide Smart Grid by 2030.

==Transportation==
Jeju City is the principal transportation center for Jeju Province. It is home to the island&#x27;s sole airport, Jeju International Airport; the Jeju-Seoul route is the world&#x27;s busiest airline route.

The island is served by Jeju International Airport in Jeju City. The Seoul–Jeju City air route is by a significant margin the world&#x27;s busiest, with around 13,400,000 passengers flown between the two cities in 2017. Other cities that have flights to Jeju are Daegu, Busan, Gunsan and Gwangju.

The port of Jeju is the largest on the island, serving the great majority of passenger, cargo, and fishing vessels. Jeju is also accessible from Busan by ferry. The travel time is between 3 and 12 hours.

The island has a public bus system, but there are no railways on the island.

A rail tunnel to the island, linking it to the Korea Train Express network has been proposed but is currently on hold due to cost concerns and local opposition in Jeju, who are aware of an eventual loss of their indigenous traits.

In 2019, Jeju Special Self-Governing Province announced the launching of a service focused on public transportation mobile IOT.

==Media==
There are five local newspapers on Jeju Island: &quot;Jeju Ilbo&quot;, &quot;Jemin Ilbo&quot;, &quot;Halla Ilbo&quot;, &quot;Seogwipo News&quot;, and &quot;Jeju Maeil&quot;. &quot;The Jeju Weekly&quot; is the only print English-language newspaper on the island. JejuWorldWide.com is a daily online news and events Web site that opened in early 2013.

TV and radio stations include Jeju Free International City Broadcasting System (an affiliate of SBS), KBS Jeju, and Jeju MBC, and KCTV Jeju.

<text>Sir Richard Brook Sykes (born 7 August 1942) is a British microbiologist, the chair of the Royal Institution, the UK Stem Cell Foundation, and the trustees at King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital, and chancellor of Brunel University. As of June 2021, he is chair of the UK&#x27;s Vaccine Taskforce, where he is responsible for overseeing the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination programme, including preparations for booster programmes and encouraging vaccine innovation in the UK.

In 1972, after gaining a first class bachelor&#x27;s degree and a doctorate, both in microbiology, Sykes was appointed head of the Antibiotic Resistance Unit at Glaxo, where he helped develop the antibiotic ceftazidime. Subsequently, he was recruited by the Squibb Institute, in the United States, where he then developed aztreonam, the first clinically effective monobactam, a term he coined in 1981 to describe a new group of monocyclic β-lactams produced by bacteria. He oversaw the merger of Glaxo with Wellcome, to form Glaxo-Wellcome in 1995 and became its chair two years later. He then oversaw the Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham merger and held its chair until 2001.

His other appointments have included being rector of Imperial College from 2001 to 2008, chairman of NHS London from December 2008 to July 2010, vice-chairman of Lonza Group until 2013, and chairman of Imperial College Healthcare from 2012 to 2018.

==Early life and education==
Richard Sykes was born in the outskirts of Huddersfield, in West Yorkshire, on 7 August 1942 to Eric Sykes and his wife Muriel Mary Sykes. He attended Royds Hall Grammar school. Prior to his A-levels and completing school, he took up a job as a technician in a pathology laboratory. After leaving secondary school he attended Paddington Technical College and Chelsea College, and gained a place at Queen Elizabeth College where he was awarded a first class BSc degree in microbiology. He received his doctorate in 1972 with a thesis on β-lactamases of &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, from the University of Bristol, where he worked with Mark Richmond. In 1973, together, they reported the first β-lactamase classification scheme.

==Glaxo and Squibb==

In 1972 Sykes was appointed head of the Antibiotic Resistance Unit at Glaxo. There, he helped develop the antibiotic ceftazidime. In 1977 he left Glaxo and was recruited to the United States by the Squibb Institute for Medical Research, where he worked under George B. Mackaness, the Australian immunologist who played an important part in getting the first ACE inhibitor, captopril, licensed. In 1979 Squibb appointed Sykes to lead research into monocyclic β-lactam antibiotics.
There, he isolated product SQ26.180 from &quot;Chromobacterium violaceum&quot;, a bacteria discovered at Pine Barrens. By modifying the amide side chain and including a ceftazidime side chain, he produced aztreonam, the first monocyclic β-lactam antibiotic. In 1981 he coined this new group of antibiotics &quot;monobactam&quot;. Its potential as a usefulness was published the following year. It could treat gram-negative infections such as gonorrhoea and became the first monobactam to be licensed for clinical use.

From 1983 to 1986 he was vice-president of infectious and metabolic diseases at Squibb. He returned to Glaxo in 1987 and succeeded David Jack, almost 30 years after Glaxo acquired Allen &amp; Hanburys. The &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; noted that at Glaxo, when a group of antibiotics failed in the last stages of clinical trial, Sykes praised the teams that had worked on them and encouraged them to move on. In 1993 he received his DSc.

In 1994, during his time at Glaxo, he was part of the group that founded the Jenner Institute for research into vaccines. In 1995 he oversaw the merger of Glaxo with Wellcome, to form Glaxo-Wellcome. In 1997, he became chair of Glaxo-Wellcome. In 2000 he oversaw the Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham merger and held its chair until 2001. The merger resulted in the marketing of several new drugs. According to Sykes at the time, &quot;the industry would be transformed by understanding the human genome&quot;.

==Royal Institution and others==
Sykes was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1997. In 1994 he became a trustee of the Natural History Museum, London, and in 1997 he was appointed senior independent director of Rio Tinto plc, a position he held until 2008.

He was a member of the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education that published an influential report in 1997.

==Later career==

===Imperial===
In January 2001, he was appointed rector of Imperial College London and completed his tenure in 2008. At Imperial, he was involved in several controversial debates including on issues such as increasing tuition fees, which he favoured. He criticised secondary schools for the quality of the science taught there, and opposed teaching grants being awarded on a per capita basis. In 2002 he proposed to merge Imperial College with University College London. The strength of opposition meant that it did not go through. He supported the lifting of the £3,000 cap on tuition fees and instead allowing the universities to set their own fees.

===UK Stem Cell Foundation===
Sykes chairs the UK Stem Cell Foundation. It was established in 2005.

===Other roles===
From 2003 to 2005 he was trustee of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. From 2007 to 2011 he was senior independent director and non-executive deputy chairman of Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation. In September 2008, he was appointed chair of NHS London, but resigned in May 2010 over the decision of the Cameron Ministry to halt former health minister Ara Darzi&#x27;s planned reorganisation of health care in London.

Between 2010 and 2012 he was on the advisory board of the Virgin Group. Until 2013, he was vice-chair at the Swiss life sciences company Lonza AG. He was appointed chairman of the Royal Institution in 2010 and Imperial College Healthcare in 2012. He was appointed Chancellor of Brunel University in 2013. In 2020, Sykes stepped down as chairman of the NetScientific Group after serving it for nine years.

===Vaccine Taskforce===
In 2020 he led an independent review of the workings of the Vaccine Taskforce. On 14 June 2021, Sykes was appointed chair of the Vaccine Taskforce, where he will be responsible for overseeing the delivery of the UK&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccination programme, including preparations for booster programmes and encouraging vaccine innovation in the UK.

==Other activities==
Sykes was chairman of the advisory panel of the think-tank Reform. He is a member of the Advisory Council for the Campaign for Science and Engineering. He is chair of the Trustees at King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital.

==Awards and honours==
Sykes was knighted in the 1994 New Year Honours.

He holds honorary degrees from several universities including Birmingham, Brunel, Cranfield, Edinburgh, Hertfordshire, Huddersfield, Hull, Leeds, Leicester, Madrid, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield Hallam, Sheffield, Strathclyde, Surrey, Warwick and Westminster. Sykes was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) in 1998.

In 2009 he received the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy&#x27;s Garrod Medal and delivered its accompanying lecture. It was titled &quot;The evolution of antimicrobial resistance: a Darwinian perspective&quot; and was published in the &quot;Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy&quot; in 2010.

<doc id="297297" wikidata="Q2975751" url="?curid=297297" title="Underwater videography">
<text>Underwater videography is the branch of electronic underwater photography concerned with capturing underwater moving images as a recreational diving, scientific, commercial, documentary, or filmmaking activity. Although technological changes since 1909 have improved the ease of operation and quality of images, significant challenges in the form of protecting equipment from water, low light levels, and the usual hazards of diving must be addressed.

==History==
In 1909, Albert Samama Chikly took the first underwater shot. In 1910, he filmed Tuna fishing in Tunisia under the patronage of Albert I, Prince of Monaco.
In 1940 Hans Hass completed &quot;Pirsch unter Wasser&quot; (i.e. &quot;Stalking under Water&quot;) which was published by the Universum Film AG, lasted originally only 16 minutes and was shown in theatres before the main movie, but would eventually be extended by additional filming done in the Adriatic Sea close to Dubrovnik. It premiered in Berlin in 1942.

&quot;Sesto Continente&quot; directed by Folco Quilici and released in 1954, was the first full-length, full-color underwater documentary. &quot;The Silent World&quot; is noted as one of the first films to use underwater cinematography to show the ocean depths in color. Its title derives from Jacques-Yves Cousteau&#x27;s 1953 book &quot;The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure&quot;.

===Submarine-based===

The first successful video-recording from a non-military submarine was made in May 1969. The purpose of the recording was to document the inspection and condition of an offshore oil storage unit located in of water off the Louisiana coast. During the mid-1960s and early 1970s, there was widespread interest in the United States in the topic of oceanography. Several major firms built small research submarines to explore the oceans. The major subs were &quot;Deep Star 4000&quot;, designed by Jacques Cousteau and built by Westinghouse Electric Company; &quot;Aluminaut&quot;, the first aluminum sub which was built by and operated by Reynolds Aluminum; &quot;Beaver&quot;, built by and operated by Rockwell International; &quot;Star III&quot;, owned and operated by Scripps Institute of Oceanography; and &quot;DOWB&quot; (Deep Ocean Work Boat), built by and operated by General Motors.

As part of their operations all of these subs attempted video-recordings. None were successful prior to 1969. The problem preventing a successful recording was in the output of the DC to AC power converted. This problem was resolved by using a different type of power converter. This new approach was used on the &quot;Shelf Diver&quot;, owned and operated by Perry Submarine to obtain the successful video-recording of the inspection of Tenneco&#x27;s &quot;Molly Brown&quot; 32,500 barrel oil storage unit. The success of this video-recording ignited an immediate interest in the oil field. Two months later the &quot;Shelf Diver&quot; was employed by Humble Oil and Refining Company to make a geological survey of the floor of the Gulf of Mexico.

==Limitations==
The primary difficulty in underwater camera usage is sealing the camera from water at high pressure, while maintaining the ability to operate it. The diving mask also inhibits the ability to view the camera image and to see the monitoring screen clearly through the camera housing. Previously the size of the video camera was also a limiting factor, necessitating large housings to enclose the separate camera and record deck. This results in a larger volume which creates extra buoyancy requiring a corresponding use of heavy weight to keep the housing underwater (about 64 lbs. per cubic foot of displacement or 1.03 kilogram per litre in sea water or 63 lbs per cubic foot of displacement (1 kilogram per litre) in fresh water). Early video cameras also needed large batteries because of the high power consumption of the system. Current Lithium-ion batteries have long run times with relatively light weight and low volume.

Another problem is the lower level of light underwater. Early cameras had problems with low light levels, were grainy, and did not record much color underwater without auxiliary lighting. Large unwieldy lighting systems were problematic to early underwater videography. And last, underwater objects viewed from an airspace with a flat window, such as the eye inside a mask or the camera inside a housing, appear to be about 25% larger than they are. The photographer needs to move farther back to get the subject into the field of view. Unfortunately that puts more water between the lens and the subject resulting in less clarity and reduced color and light. This problem is solved by the use of dome ports. Dome ports allow for very close subject distances, decreasing the in-water light path and improving image brightness and color saturation.

==Modern improvements==
Today, the small size of fully automatic camcorders with large view screens and long-life rechargeable batteries has reduced the housing size and made underwater videography an easy, fun activity for the diver. Low-cost wide-angle lens add-ons are available for many cameras and some can even be fitted outside the camera housing for versatile use. This lets the photographer get closer and make the subject clearer and also with fewer focusing and depth of field problems. Today cameras are more sensitive to low light conditions and make automatic color balancing adjustments. Nevertheless, deeper water videography still needs auxiliary light sources to bring out colors filtered out of sunlight by the distance it has travelled through water. The longest wavelengths of light are lost first (reds and yellows) leaving only a greenish or blue cast in deep water. Even a hand light will help show off some of the magnificent colors of a coral reef or other marine life if used during recording.

Modern underwater video lights are now relatively small, have run times of 45–60 minutes and output 600-8000 lumens. These LED lights are powered by Lithium-ion batteries and usually have a 5600K (daylight) color temperature.

==Video housings==
Many modern underwater housing are pressure resistant up to about 330 feet (100M). Typical construction is from moulded polycarbonate plastic, or aluminum for more professional systems. They usually have quick release snaps, an o-ring seal, and through housings fittings for several camera controls. A few are generic in nature from several manufacturers (such as Ikelite), and may be adaptable to several camera sizes. Most housings, however, are specific to the size and controls of a particular camera (such as Amphibico) type and may be marketed by the camera manufacturer or an after-market company.

Housed video cameras now record in HD (1920X1080) with some cameras operating at 4K (3840 x 2160) resolutions. Recording media may be solid state Solid-state drives (SSD), SXS cards, professional flash media or SDHC/XC cards. Codecs include H.265, H.264, XAVC and others. Small &quot;action&quot; cameras such as the GoPro style cameras have taken diving by storm and create incredible images for relatively little cost, provided that there is sufficient light. These cameras often record on SDXC/HC or MicroSD cards. These cards should have data record rates of at least 45 MB/s (Ultra) or faster.

Occasionally housings might be advertised as &quot;waterproof housings&quot; rather than underwater housings. Waterproof housings are not intended for deep water use, but rather are splash protection housings for use around the pool, in rain, or to protect if dropped overboard. At the most they are for very shallow activities - usually not more than about 1 or 2 metres / 3 to 6 feet in depth. One manufacturer offers a plastic bag type housing with a watertight seal, and a glass port front. The flexible bag allows some modest camera control, but when taken deeper the air inside the bag compresses from the pressure and makes the controls nearly impossible to operate. These bags are usually limited to shallow snorkeling activities and damage to the bag may cause irreparable flooding damage.

==Still/video combinations==
Most current digital still cameras are also capable of capturing professional quality video images. This is usually a variation of the MPEG video standard of digital imaging created as a streaming series of digital images, with some advanced compression techniques. Codecs include QuickTime Video, H.265, H.264, WMV or AVI files.

A dedicated video camera, on the other hand may also have a &quot;still frame&quot; or snapshot capability. This is a better choice if the first intent is to have high quality moving pictures and an occasional still picture. Camera capacity, based on videotapes, or even harddrive recording is usually at least 2 hours, and necessitates very little opening of the housing during the dive day. Check the Pixel quality (16 megapixels or above preferred) on the still camera capability if this is of interest. Ultra-high-definition television cameras (4K UHD), provide the best quality and image resolution.

The trend today is toward replaceable memory cards for recording, or internal hard-drives built into the camera. This provides maximum versatility, high recording time options, and few mechanical breakdown possibilities, not to mention minimizing problems with condensation affecting the recording (tape) media of previous generations. The subsequent files may be easily transferred to a computer and edited with low-cost software solutions (and a reasonably high performance computer and video card). The subsequent results may be transferred to a hard drive, CD, DVD, Blu-ray Disc or thumbdrive for easy distribution or archiving. Many videographers maintain their own YouTube or Vimeo channel for sharing and showcasing their work.

==Training and certification==
Training and certification for recreational divers as hobbyist level underwater videographers is available through some recreational diver training agencies, but professional class underwater videography is demonstrated by the quality of the product, and there is no requirement for certification by a diver training agency. It is a work skill, not a diving skill. 

==Risk==
The usual hazards of underwater diving are generally not directly affected using video equipment, but the risk associated with these hazards may be increased by task loading. This generally reduces the available attention and situational awareness of the operator, and the additional encumbrance of large video equipment reduces the diver&#x27;s ability to react swiftly and precisely to rectify problems before they become serious. These issues are generally mitigated by practice, and where appropriate an assistant may be useful. Diving with a skilled and attentive buddy can also reduce the risk of problems getting out of control, but this buddy must be dedicated to monitoring the videographer throughout the dive to be of value.

<text>Archers of Loaf is an American indie rock band originally formed in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, in 1991. The group toured extensively and released four studio albums, one compilation, numerous singles and EPs, and a live album which was released after the band broke up in 1998. In 2011 the band began a reunion tour that coincided with the reissue of four of its albums by Merge Records. In July 2022, the band announced the release of their first album in nearly 25 years, &quot;Reason in Decline&quot;, released also via Merge Records in October of the same year.

==History==
===Early history (1991–1995)===
Singer/guitarist Eric Bachmann, guitarist Eric Johnson, bassist Matt Gentling, and drummer Mark Price, all originally from Asheville, North Carolina, formed Archers of Loaf in the early 1990s. Eric Bachmann was a saxophone major at Appalachian State University before dropping out because he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to be a high school band director.&quot;

Their initial release in 1992 was a 45&quot; single, &quot;Wrong&quot; b/w &quot;South Carolina&quot; given away free with issue 1 of &quot;Stay Free!&quot; magazine.

The band signed with Alias records, and released their second single &quot;Web in Front&quot; in February 1993; it received moderate college radio airplay. The song was featured in a season five episode of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, and was included on the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Mallrats&quot; in 1995.

Archers of Loaf released their debut full-length album, &quot;Icky Mettle&quot;, in September 1993. It was critically well-received, with critic Robert Christgau awarding his second-highest rating of &quot;A&quot;, and peaked at #18 on the &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; Top 150 Album charts, charting for 21 weeks. In the 2008 book &quot;The Pitchfork 500&quot; named &quot;Web in Front&quot; one of the top 500 songs of recent decades.

In 1994, the Archers released the EP &quot;Vs the Greatest of All Time&quot;. However, the song &quot;The Greatest of All Time&quot; does not appear on this release but rather the second full-length album, &quot;Vee Vee&quot;, released in 1995. &quot;Vee Vee&quot; followed a similar template as their previous recordings and featured the track &quot;Harnessed in Slums&quot;, which became popular on college radio. The album also garnered significant attention outside the independent music scene, culminating in the band being courted by Maverick Records, a division of Warner Music Group, which the band rejected. Bachmann later stated that he and the band did not really consider the offer. The band was still under contract with Alias, and changing labels would put them into considerable debt to Maverick. According to Bachmann, &quot;We already signed a deal [with Alias] and it costs lots of money to get out of these things. If we would have had Maverick buy out our contract, we&#x27;d be however many thousands of dollars in debt to them. It&#x27;s really complex that way and it really didn&#x27;t make sense to do that.&quot; The band had another reason for rejecting the Maverick offer: They did not want to be associated with the other high-profile bands on Maverick. &quot;The other bands [on Maverick] were that bad,&quot; said Price at the time. &quot;There are other bands on major labels that are associated with a lot of shit but it&#x27;s big enough that there are a least a few bands that you like. For us on Maverick, it&#x27;d be us and Candlebox and Alanis...&quot;

In 1995 the band had its highest-profile tour opening for Weezer. The band&#x27;s sometimes brash sound did not go over all that well with the Weezer crowd, and Gentling later said of the tour, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t as much that we didn&#x27;t like the Weezer guys, but the opening bands get treated like crap by the people who work (at the venues). And as far as our music is concerned, I don&#x27;t really know if we&#x27;re all that compatible, at least live.&quot; In 1996 the band released &quot;The Speed of Cattle,&quot; a collection of B-sides, singles, and John Peel session tracks.

===Later years and breakup (1996–1998)===
Their third studio album, 1996&#x27;s &quot;All the Nation&#x27;s Airports&quot;, was considered far more accessible than their previous releases, and was the first to be distributed by a major label, Elektra Records (the band was still signed to Alias Records, though). The album was recorded in Seattle and took three weeks to complete, which was the most time the band had been in the studio to complete an album up to that point.

Gentling said of the experience, &quot;We knew we wanted to take a long time on this album. We specifically wanted not to do tracks over and over and over again, but more to work on tone and get all of our instruments down right. We took over a day (just) to get the drums sounding right.&quot;

The band toured extensively in support of the record, to limited mass commercial success. Of the tour, Bachmann said, &quot;We got back and we were not real happy with the way that [the tour] went. Usually when you finish a tour you have a general idea of a song or two you can start working on, but we got back and were like &#x27;geez, what are we going to do?&#x27;&quot; The band almost broke up at this point, due to a general lack of enthusiasm for the continuation of the project. However, after some soul searching, they decided to continue on for the time being. &quot;We thought we&#x27;d had too good a time with it, so let&#x27;s make another record, do another tour, and if there&#x27;s not another spark, we&#x27;ll split up after that,&quot; said Bachmann of the episode.

Their final LP, &quot;White Trash Heroes&quot;, was released in 1998. The album&#x27;s style deviated drastically from their first three albums, and received mixed reviews from critics. The album&#x27;s creative break from the band&#x27;s previous work may have stemmed from the different writing process used for &quot;White Trash Heroes&quot;. According to Bachmann, &quot;Things were laid down one at a time, though we did play a lot of it live, too, but pieced together more perfectly so we could hear when one sound was beginning to get in the way of something else.&quot; The band went to great lengths in the studio in an attempt to keep the writing from turning stale. For example, on the song &quot;Banging on a Dead Drum,&quot; the band members all switched instruments to try to liven up the feel of the song. Johnson plays drums, Gentling plays slide guitar, Price plays bass, and Bachmann still plays guitar, as he was the one who knew the song.

This approach made playing songs from the album on the last tour more difficult. &quot;Certain songs we don&#x27;t even play yet,&quot; Bachmann stated in an interview during the &quot;White Trash Heroes&quot; tour. &quot;We haven&#x27;t even learned them that well due to the way the record was pieced together. They&#x27;re not impossible to play, we just haven&#x27;t pulled them out yet...as time goes on we learn more of the new ones, and they&#x27;ve been coming across fine.&quot; During the tour supporting the album, Eric Johnson missed several dates due to his day job&#x27;s work schedule. Brian Causey, guitarist for Man or Astro-man? and friend of the band, filled in for the missing Johnson. In late 1998, after Price was diagnosed with, and subsequently had surgery for, carpal tunnel syndrome, the band decided to call it quits for good.

===Post-breakup projects===
Bachmann moved on to multiple solo projects and the band Crooked Fingers. Gentling went on to provide extra instrumentation on tour with another North Carolina-bred band, Superchunk as well as a brief stint as live bassist for Band of Horses, the Poles, and Analog Moon. He has also continued to work with Bachmann as a contributor in Crooked Fingers. Johnson self-released one EP and one full-length under the moniker &quot;Spookie&quot; (originally Spookie J) and attended law school in North Carolina. He continues to play and record. In 2000, Alias released &quot;Seconds Before the Accident.&quot; This project was the band&#x27;s first official live album and was recorded during their final show at the Cat&#x27;s Cradle in Carrboro. It was the last album released by the band.

===Reunion (2011–present)===
On January 15, 2011, Archers of Loaf reunited to play an unannounced set at The Cat&#x27;s Cradle in Carrboro, North Carolina. They opened for local act The Love Language. On May 29, 2011, they performed at the Sasquatch! Music Festival outside of Seattle, Washington which was recorded for broadcast and archive by NPR Music and KEXP-FM. The band were chosen by Les Savy Fav to perform at the ATP Nightmare Before Christmas festival that they co-curated in December 2011 in Minehead, England. On June 25, 2011, the band performed their song &quot;Wrong&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. The band continued to tour throughout 2011 and 2012 while their back catalog was reissued by Merge Records.

Bachmann has stated in interviews that his thought processes around the band have changed over time and that his relationships with the older material are also different: &quot;Essentially, before, when I was a 20-year-old kid playing that stuff, I got some sense of satisfaction or power. I felt confident playing in front of people. Now I don&#x27;t feel that satisfaction or that power,&quot; he said. &quot;The reward I get now is I&#x27;m going out and people are enjoying hearing it. My relationship had to change with the songs, and in that light I like all of them.&quot;

Asked about the band&#x27;s future plans, Bachmann did not rule out a new album, but noted that it was not something that was on the immediate horizon following the reunion tour. &quot;The worst thing [Archers of Loaf] could do is force something out and have it be a bad version of something we already did. It&#x27;s going to have to be a forward step. I don&#x27;t want to recreate the 25-year-old kid writing the songs that I would do now with those three other guys, so we&#x27;d have to think that through. They&#x27;re very good to work with, in that way. It&#x27;s not out of the question, because everyone thinks the same way. No one wants to do &#x27;Icky Mettle 2.&#x27;&quot;

A live concert documentary &quot;What Did You Expect?&quot;, capturing the band&#x27;s August 2011 performances at The Cat&#x27;s Cradle was released in 2012. The film was directed by Gorman Bechard. In 2015, the band released the double album Curse of the Loaf, which is the Brian Paulson produced concert audio from the documentary. The deluxe package also featured the original poster from the two nights at Cat&#x27;s Cradle, as well as a copy of the film.

In a 2018 interview with Eric Bachmann, he said all of the members of Archers of Loaf are on board with the idea of reforming and making a new record, saying &quot;Oh yeah, everybody wants to do it — I just have to write the songs.&quot; In November 2019, the band posted a video on their YouTube channel entitled &quot;The Return Of The Loaf,&quot; teasing toward new music.

On February 20, 2020, the Archers of Loaf digitally released &quot;Raleigh Days&quot;, their first new music since 1998.

On July 13, 2022, the Archers of Loaf announced their first LP in 24 years, &quot;Reason in Decline&quot;, which was released on October 21, 2022, via Merge Records. With the announcement, they also released a new single, &quot;In the Surface Noise&quot; and announced a week of East Coast tour dates for late November/early December 2022. The single &quot;Screaming Undercover&quot; followed in August 2022, with an animated video created by Paul Friedrich.

<doc id="297299" wikidata="Q1269584" url="?curid=297299" title="E-M-F Company">
<text>The E-M-F Company was an early American automobile manufacturer that produced automobiles from 1909 to 1912. The name E-M-F was gleaned from the initials of the three company founders: Barney Everitt (a custom auto-body builder from Detroit), William Metzger (formerly of Cadillac), and Walter Flanders (who had served as Henry Ford&#x27;s production manager).

== Origins ==
=== Everitt ===
Byron Forbes &quot;Barney&quot; Everitt was born in 1873 at Ridgetown, Ontario, and learned wagon-building in Chatham, Ontario. In the early 1890s he worked for carriage-maker Hugh Johnson in Detroit. In 1899 he started his own coachwork company, with orders from Ransom Olds, and then Henry Ford. In about 1904 his own first assembled car was the Wayne. The car model bearing his name was the Everitt, 1909-1912.

=== Metzger ===
William E. Metzger was born 1868 in Peru, Illinois. He was one of the first car salesmen, a buyer and reseller and, in the late 1890s, established possibly the first United States automobile dealership, in Detroit. He was a key figure in the Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers, and also promoted early races at Grosse Pointe. In 1902 he became affiliated with the Northern Motor Car Company and the same year helped organize Cadillac before taking orders at the New York Automobile Show in January 1903.

=== Flanders ===
Walter E. Flanders was born March 4, 1871, in Waterbury, Vermont. He was a machinist who started with servicing sewing machines during an apprenticeship at Singer Corporation, followed by an association with Thomas S. Walburn in general machining in Cleveland, Ohio, in the late 1890s. An order came from Henry Ford in Detroit to the company for a thousand crankshafts, and Ford was impressed by the response. Then in the early 1900s Flanders again worked with Walburn, this time for Ford at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant at the corner of Piquette and Beaubien Streets in Detroit. Flanders became manager of manufacturing at the plant, where he also worked with the two future vice-presidents in charge of manufacturing, Peter E. Martin, and Charles E. Sorensen. Flanders was replaced by those two when he resigned abruptly on 21 April 1908. Flanders&#x27; skill was in setting up and effecting timesaving procedures and methods at the plant, where engineers had developed the Model T in late 1907, which then began production in 1908, and led eventually to invention of the new moving assembly line to meet skyrocketing demand for the Model T in 1910.

== Overview ==

In 1909, E-M-F bought the Detroit plant of the De Luxe company and began production of E-M-F cars. E-M-F produced several models of its own design and contracted to sell them through Studebaker wagon dealerships. At one point, E-M-F vehicles outproduced all but Ford in the American market.

Late in 1909, E-M-F established a Walkerville, Ontario, branch plant to produce the E-M-F 30 and Flanders 20. E-M-F had a third plant in Port Huron, which was sold to the Havers Motor Car Company in 1912.

Shortly afterward, E-M-F was bought out by Studebaker, which formed Studebaker Canada, and rebadged E-M-F&#x27;s products: the E-M-F as the Studebaker 30 and the Flanders as the Studebaker 20. Sales of these rebadged models continued through the end of 1912.

=== Baby E-M-F ===

Brothers Nels E. and Alex Swanson of Stromsburg, Nebraska took it upon themselves to make a miniature version of an existing car in order to gain notoriety for their skills as automotive engineers. In 1910, they started building a miniature version of an E-M-F 30 Touring Car. The car was exhibited at the Chicago Auto Show in February 1910 and was soon dubbed the &quot;Baby E-M-F&quot;. It is considered to be the first scaled-down miniature car ever produced.

== Takeover ==
Studebaker&#x27;s president Fred Fish (son-in-law of John M. Studebaker), being unhappy with E-M-F&#x27;s poor quality and lack of management, gained control of the assets and plant facilities (at Detroit and Walkerville, Ontario) in 1910. To remedy the damage done by E-M-F, Studebaker paid mechanics to visit each unsatisfied owner and replace the defective parts in their vehicles at a cost of US$1 million to the company. The E-M-F name continued into 1912 with the Studebaker name becoming more and more prevalent on the cars. In 1913, the E-M-F name was replaced by Studebaker.

Problems aside, E-M-F vehicles had sold well in the growing marketplace. In 1909 E-M-F placed fourth (producing 7,960 vehicles) in total US automobile production, behind that of Ford Motor Company, Buick, and Maxwell, with Cadillac fifth. In 1910 the firm built 15,020 vehicles and again held on to fourth place behind Ford, Buick, and Overland. In 1911, the firm placed second in overall assemblies with 26,827 automobiles produced for the year. In his history of E-M-F, Anthony Yanik stated Studebaker built its strong automotive base &quot;on the shoulders of E-M-F&quot;, having &quot;purchased the entire company for an outrageous price in 1910&quot;. However, the E-M-F production figures had been underpinned by Studebaker&#x27;s vast resources, and sales were largely dependent on Studebaker&#x27;s reputation and marketing network.

Flanders also ran the short-lived Flanders Automobile Company, which produced cars wholly based on previous E-M-F designs. The Flanders company was absorbed into Maxwell Motor Company (Incorporated) which was reorganized out of the assets of the United States Motor Company in 1913.

On June 20, 2005, the E-M-F (and previously Wayne Automobile) Detroit plant on Piquette Avenue and John R. Street caught fire and within a few hours it was gone. The five-alarm fire nearly spread to the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant where Henry Ford built the first Model T.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1957 with the song &quot;All&quot;, composed by Reynell Wreford, with lyrics by Alan Stranks, and performed by Patricia Bredin. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final, the second edition of &quot;Festival of British Popular Songs&quot; and, subsequently, the performer internally once the national final was over. This was the first-ever entry from the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest, and the first-ever entry performed in English in the contest. 

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;Festival of British Popular Songs 1957 &quot; ===
The United Kingdom was represented in the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time in . The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) did not participate in the inaugural contest in , as it had created its own contest, the &quot;Festival of British Popular Songs&quot;, aspects of which influenced the 1957 Eurovision contest.

The &quot;Festival of British Popular Songs 1957&quot; served as the selection for the United Kingdom&#x27;s entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 1957. All British music publishing companies were invited to submit each one song for the national selection. Around 70 to 80 songs were reportedly submitted. A jury consisting of Jack Payne, Harry S. Pepper, Cyril Stapleton, Walter Ridley and Frank Lee met in December 1956 to select the competing entries of the live shows. The interpreting artists were chosen separately by the BBC production team.

The &quot;Festival of British Popular Songs 1957&quot; consisted of three semi finals and a grand final. All shows took place in the King&#x27;s Theatre, Hammersmith (West London). They were produced by Francis Essex. The presenter was David Jacobs, who would host many other British national finals the following years. Since the &quot;Festival of British Popular Songs 1956&quot; was judged to be lacking effectiveness because it stretched over several months, it was decided that the 1957 edition would consist of weekly shows. 

Six songs competed in each semi-final. The songs were scored by ten regional juries, each consisting of twelve members of the general public. Each juror awarded one point to their favourite song. Two songs in each heat advanced to the national final.

==== Semi-finals ====
The first semi-final took place on 22 January 1957 at 19:45 GMT. The artists were accompanied by the Bill McGuffie Quintet and an orchestra under the musical direction of Eric Robinson. For the interval, Dennis Lotis performed &quot;Everybody Fall in Love With Someone&quot;, the winning song of the Festival of British Popular Songs 1956. The ten regional juries in the first semi-final were from the cities of Birmingham, Aberdeen, Cardiff, Newcastle, Belfast, Manchester, Bangor, Bristol, Glasgow and London. The broadcast was watched by 6.8 million viewers in the United Kingdom.

The second semi-final took place on 29 January 1957 at 21:00 GMT. The artists were accompanied by the Frank Weir Quintet as well as by an orchestra conducted by Stanley Black. For the interval act, the Frank Weir Quartet performed &quot;The Way It Goes&quot;, the winning song from the first heat. The ten regional juries in the second semi-final were from the cities of Manchester, Leeds, Edinburgh, Swansea, Bangor, Plymouth, Bristol, Belfast, Nottingham and London. 7.1 million viewer in the United Kingdom watched the program.

The third semi-final took place on 5 February 1957 at 19:45 GMT. The artists were accompanied by the Malcolm Lockyer Quartet as well as by an orchestra under the musical direction of Frank Chacksfield. The ten regional juries in semi-final 3 were from the cities of Swansea, Glasgow, Plymouth, Leeds, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Aberdeen, Cardiff and London. The program was watched by 7.1 million viewers. The song &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Little Doll&quot; was subject to controversy since the songwriters had sold the copyright to a different music publisher before and it was not clear whether the song had been published before. Finally, it turned out that the song had only been on a test pressing and the BBC allowed the song to compete in the final.

==== Final ====
The final of the &quot;Festival of British Popular Songs 1957&quot; was held on 12 February 1957 at 19:45 GMT. The artists were accompanied by an orchestra under the musical direction of three different conductors: The performances of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Little Doll&quot; and &quot;All&quot; were conducted by Frank Chacksfield, &quot;Once&quot; and &quot;For Your Love&quot; were conducted by Stanley Black, &quot;Seven&quot; and &quot;The Way It Goes&quot; by Eric Robinson so that all songs in the final were conducted by the same conductor as in their respective semi-final. 

The regional juries for the final were from the cities of Belfast, Newcastle, Bangor, Edinburgh, Nottingham, Cardiff, Birmingham, Glasgow, Manchester and London. A cup was presented to the winning composer, Reynell Wreford. The broadcast was watched by 7.5 million viewers in the United Kingdom.

=== Recordings ===
Patricia Bredin never recorded the winning song &quot;All&quot; but a recording of the song was released by English singer Robert Earl. In addition, an instrumental version by Victor Sylvester as a single reached number 14 in the sheet music charts. 

== At Eurovision ==
Patricia Bredin delivered an operatic performance of &quot;All&quot;, performing third that night following and preceding with &quot;. The conductor was Eric Robinson. At a length of 1:52 minutes, it was the shortest entry in the history of the contest until Finland in 2015 as well as the first song to be performed in English. The song also turned out to perform right before Italy&#x27;s &quot;, the longest entry in the history of the contest at 5:09 minutes.

At the close of voting, the United Kingdom had received six points and finished seventh among the ten countries, despite points from five of the nine other countries. It would take the United Kingdom until not to finish in the first half of the scoreboard again.

=== Voting ===
Each participating broadcaster assembled a ten-member jury panel. Every juror could give one point to their favourite song.

<doc id="297302" wikidata="Q1547176" url="?curid=297302" title="Groat (English coin)">
<text>The groat is the traditional name of a defunct English and Irish silver coin worth four pence, and also a Scottish coin which was originally worth fourpence, with later issues being valued at eightpence and one shilling.

==Name==
The name has also been applied to any thick or large coin, such as the &quot;Groschen&quot; (&quot;grosso&quot;), a silver coin issued by Tyrol in 1271 and Venice in the 13th century, which was the first of this general size to circulate in the Holy Roman Empire and other parts of Europe. The immediate ancestor to the groat was the French &quot;gros tournois&quot; or groat of Tours, which was known as the &quot;groot&quot; (Dutch for &quot;great&quot; or &quot;large&quot;) in the Netherlands.

The name also refers to a range of other European coins such as those of the Italian peninsula known as a &quot;grosso&quot; including the grosso of Venice and the Kraków grosz in Poland. Marco Polo referred to the groat in recounts of his travels to East Asia when describing the currencies of the Yuan Empire. His descriptions were based on the conversion of 1 bezant = 20 groats = tornesel.

==History==


It was after the French silver coin had circulated in England that an English groat was first minted under King Edward I.

Scottish groats were not issued until the reign of David II. Scots groats were originally also worth fourpence, but later issues were valued at eightpence and a shilling.

Irish groats were minted first in 1425 and the last ones were minted under the reign of Elizabeth I of England. There were also two more issues, both emergency coinage.

Since the pound sterling or 240 pence was based from the 12th century on a Tower Pound or of sterling or 0.925 fine silver, the 
English groat or fourpence therefore contained of sterling silver. Later issues became progressively lighter: in 1351 under Edward III, in 1412 under Henry IV, and in 1464 under Edward IV. From 1544 to 1560 (the weight being reduced to 32 grains (2.1 g) in 1559) the silver fineness was less than sterling, and after the 1561 issue they were not generally issued for circulation again for about a hundred years.

From the reigns of Charles II to George III, groats (by now often known as fourpences) were issued on an irregular basis for general circulation, the only years of mintage after 1786 being in 1792, 1795, and 1800. After this the only circulating issues were from 1836 to 1855, with proofs known from 1857 and 1862, and a colonial issue of 1888. These last coins had the weight further reduced to about 27 grains (1.9 grams) and were the same diameter as the silver threepenny pieces of the day although thicker. They also had Britannia on the reverse, while all other silver fourpenny pieces since the reign of William and Mary have had a crowned numeral &quot;4&quot; as the reverse, including the silver fourpenny Maundy money coins of the present. Some groats continued to circulate in Scotland until the 20th century.

At times in the past, silver twopenny coins have been called &quot;half-groats&quot;.

The groat ceased to be minted in the United Kingdom in 1856, but in 1888 a special request was made for a colonial variety to be minted for use in British Guiana and the British West Indies. The groat remained in circulation in British Guiana right up until that territory adopted the decimal system in 1955.

Groats are still issued in sets of Maundy coinage.

===Royal Navy chaplains===
In the 1600s and 1700s, chaplains were employed in English Navy ships of war by the captain, and paid out of a groat per month deducted from the wages of the seamen. The Navy&#x27;s wages did not rise between 1653 and 1797 (see Spithead and Nore mutinies), during which time the ordinary seaman was paid 19 shillings, as was the chaplain.

<doc id="297308" wikidata="Q1337955" url="?curid=297308" title="John Crowe Ransom">
<text>John Crowe Ransom (April 30, 1888 – July 3, 1974) was an American educator, scholar, literary critic, poet, essayist and editor. He is considered to be a founder of the New Criticism school of literary criticism. As a faculty member at Kenyon College, he was the first editor of the widely regarded &quot;Kenyon Review&quot;. Highly respected as a teacher and mentor to a generation of accomplished students, he also was a prize-winning poet and essayist. He was nominated for the 1973 Nobel Prize in Literature.

==Background==
John Crowe Ransom was born on April 30, 1888, in Pulaski, Tennessee. His father, John James Ransom (1853–1934) was a Methodist minister. His mother was Sara Ella (Crowe) Ransom (1859–1947). He had two sisters, Annie Phillips and Ella Irene, and one brother, Richard. He grew up in Spring Hill, Franklin, Springfield, and Nashville, Tennessee. He was home schooled until age ten. From 1899 to 1903, he attended the Bowen School, a public school whose headmaster was Vanderbilt alumnus Angus Gordon Bowen.

He entered Vanderbilt University in Nashville at the age of fifteen, graduating first in his class in 1909. His philosophy professor was Collins Denny, later a Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Ransom interrupted his studies for two years to teach sixth and seventh grades at the Taylorsville High School in Taylorsville, Mississippi, followed by teaching Latin and Greek at the Haynes-McLean School in Lewisburg, Tennessee. After teaching one more year in Lewisburg, he was selected as a Rhodes Scholar. He attended Christ Church, Oxford, 1910–13, where he read Greats, taking a second class degree.

==Career==
Ransom taught Latin for one year at the Hotchkiss School alongside Samuel Claggett Chew (1888–1960). He was then appointed to the English department at Vanderbilt University in 1914. During the First World War, he served as an artillery officer in France. After the war, he returned to Vanderbilt. He was a founding member of the Fugitives, a Southern literary group of sixteen writers that functioned primarily as a kind of poetry workshop and included Donald Davidson, Allen Tate, and Robert Penn Warren. Under their influence, Ransom, whose first interest had been philosophy (specifically John Dewey and American pragmatism) began writing poetry. His first volume of poems, &quot;Poems about God&quot; (1919), was praised by Robert Frost and Robert Graves. The Fugitive Group had a special interest in Modernist poetry and, under Ransom&#x27;s editorship, started a short-lived but highly influential magazine, called &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, which published American Modernist poets, mainly from the South (though they also published Northerners like Hart Crane). Out of all the Fugitive poets, Norton poetry editors Richard Ellmann and Robert O&#x27;Clair opined that, &quot;[Ransom&#x27;s poems were] among the most remarkable,&quot; characterizing his poetry as &quot;quirky&quot; and &quot;at times eccentric.&quot;

In 1930, alongside eleven other Southern Agrarians, he published the conservative, Agrarian manifesto &quot;I&#x27;ll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition&quot;, which assailed the tide of industrialism that appeared to be sweeping away traditional Southern culture. The Agrarians believed that the Southern tradition, rooted in the pre-Civil War agricultural model, was the answer to the South&#x27;s economic and cultural problems. His contribution to &quot;I&#x27;ll Take My Stand&quot; is his essay &quot;Reconstructed but Unregenerate&quot; which starts the book and lays out the Southern Agrarians&#x27; basic argument. In various essays influenced by his Agrarian beliefs, Ransom defended the manifesto&#x27;s assertion that modern industrial capitalism was a dehumanizing force that the South should reject in favor of an agrarian economic model. However, by the late 1930s he began to distance himself from the movement, and in 1945, he publicly criticized it. He remained an active essayist until his death even though, by the 1970s, the popularity and influence of the New Critics had seriously diminished.

In 1937, he accepted a position at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. He was the founding editor of the &quot;Kenyon Review&quot;, and continued as editor until his retirement in 1959. In 1966, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

He has few peers among twentieth-century American university teachers of humanities; his distinguished students included Donald Davidson, Randall Jarrell, George Lanning, Robert Lowell, Andrew Lytle, Allen Tate, Peter Taylor, Robie Macauley, Robert Penn Warren, E.L. Doctorow, Cleanth Brooks, Richard M. Weaver, James Wright, and Constantinos Patrides (himself a Rhodes Scholar, who dedicated his monograph on John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Lycidas&quot; to Ransom&#x27;s memory). His literary reputation is based chiefly on two collections of poetry, &quot;Chills and Fever&quot; (1924) and &quot;Two Gentlemen in Bonds&quot; (1927). Believing he had no new themes upon which to write, his subsequent poetic activity consisted almost entirely of revising (&quot;tinkering&quot;, he called it) his earlier poems. Hence Ransom&#x27;s reputation as a poet is based on the fewer than 160 poems he wrote and published between 1916 and 1927. In 1963, the poet/critic and former Ransom student Randall Jarrell published an essay in which he highly praised Ransom&#x27;s poetry: Despite the brevity of his poetic career and output, Ransom won the Bollingen Prize for Poetry in 1951. His 1963 &quot;Selected Poems&quot; received the National Book Award the following year.

He primarily wrote short poems examining the ironic and unsentimental nature of life (with domestic life in the American South being a major theme). An example of his Southern style is his poem &quot;Janet Waking&quot;, which &quot;mixes modernist with old-fashioned country rhetoric.&quot; He was noted as a strict formalist, using both regular rhyme and meter in almost all of his poems. He also occasionally employed archaic diction. Ellman and O&#x27;Clair note that &quot;[Ransom] defends formalism because he sees in it a check on bluntness, on brutality. Without formalism, he insists, poets simply rape or murder their subjects.&quot;

He was a leading figure of the school of literary criticism known as the New Criticism, which gained its name from his 1941 volume of essays &quot;The New Criticism&quot;. The New Critical theory, which dominated American literary thought throughout the middle 20th century, emphasized close reading, and criticism based on the texts themselves rather than on non-textual bias or non-textual history. In his seminal 1937 essay, &quot;Criticism, Inc.&quot; Ransom laid out his ideal form of literary criticism stating that, &quot;criticism must become more scientific, or precise and systematic.&quot; To this end, he argued that personal responses to literature, historical scholarship, linguistic scholarship, and what he termed &quot;moral studies&quot; should not influence literary criticism. He also argued that literary critics should regard a poem as an aesthetic object. Many of the ideas he explained in this essay would become very important in the development of The New Criticism. &quot;Criticism, Inc.&quot; and a number of Ransom&#x27;s other theoretical essays set forth some of the guiding principles that the New Critics would build upon. Still, his former students, specifically Allen Tate, Cleanth Brooks, and Robert Penn Warren, had a greater hand in developing many of the key concepts (like &quot;close reading&quot;) that later came to define the New Criticism.

In 1951, he was awarded the Russell Loines Award for Poetry from the National Institute of Arts and Letters.

==Personal life and death==
In 1920, he married Robb Reavill, a well-educated young woman who shared his interest in sports and games. Together they raised three children: a daughter, Helen, and two sons, David and John.

Ransom died on July 3, 1974, in Gambier at the age of eighty-six. He was buried at the Kenyon College Cemetery in Gambier.

<text>The United Baltic Duchy (; ; ), or alternatively the Grand Duchy of Livonia, was the name of a short-lived state during World War I that was proclaimed by leaders of the local Baltic German nobility.

The attempt to establish a new client state of the German Empire on the territory of what is now Latvia and Estonia was made in 1918, during the German occupation of the former Courland, Livonian and Estonian governorates of the Russian Empire; which had ceased to exist after the Bolshevik coup in 1917. The unsuccessful proclamation of a pro-German duchy was first made in April 1918, after the Republic of Estonia had already formally declared full independence.

The proposed ideas for the new state included the creation of a Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and of a Duchy of Estonia and Livonia, which would be in personal union with the Kingdom of Prussia. 

== Background ==
During World War I, the Imperial German Army had occupied the Courland Governorate of the Russian Empire by the autumn of 1915. The front stabilised along the Riga–Daugavpils–Baranovichi Line.

After the February Revolution of 1917 in Russia, the Russian Provisional Government declared the establishment of the Autonomous Governorate of Estonia on , which amalgamated the former Russian Governorate of Estonia and the northern portion of the Governorate of Livonia. After the October Revolution later that year, the elected Estonian Provincial Assembly declared itself the sovereign power in Estonia on 28 November 1917. On 24 February 1918, a day before the arrival of German troops, the Estonian Salvation Committee of the Provincial Assembly issued the Estonian Declaration of Independence. The Western Allies recognised the Republic of Estonia &quot;de facto&quot; in May 1918.

The term &#x27;Grand Duchy of Livonia&#x27; refers to the Livonia region, which made up most of the proposed United Baltic Duchy.

The Latvian Provisional National Council was constituted on the basis of the law of self-government, which the Russian Provisional Government granted to Latvia on 5 July 1917. The Latvian Provisional National Council first met on 16 November 1917 in Valka. On 30 November, the Council declared an autonomous Latvian province within ethnographic boundaries, and a formally independent Latvian republic was declared on 15 January 1918.

In early 1918, German troops started advancing from Courland, and by the end of February 1918, the German military administered the territories of Estonia that had declared independence and the Russian Governorate of Livonia. In the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 3 March 1918, Soviet Russia accepted the loss of the Courland Governorate and, in agreements concluded in Berlin on 27 August 1918, the loss of the Autonomous Governorate of Estonia and the Governorate of Livonia.

== Attempt at creation ==

As a parallel political movement under the German military administration, Baltic Germans began forming provincial councils between September 1917 and March 1918.

On 8 March 1918, the local Baltic German-dominated declared the restoration of Duchy of Courland (), which was formally recognised by Kaiser Wilhelm on 15 March 1918.

On 12 April 1918, a Provincial Assembly (), composed of 35 Baltic Germans, 13 Estonians, and 11 Latvians, passed a resolution calling upon the German Emperor to recognise the Baltic provinces as a monarchy and to make them a German protectorate.

The United Baltic Duchy was nominally recognised as a sovereign state by Wilhelm II only on 22 September 1918, half a year after Soviet Russia had formally relinquished all authority over former Russian Imperial Baltic governorates to Germany in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. On 5 November 1918, a temporary Regency Council () for the new state, led by Baron Adolf Pilar von Pilchau, was formed on a joint basis from both local Land Councils.

The new state was to have its capital in Riga and was to be a confederation of seven cantons: (Courland), Riga, (Latgale), (South Livonia), (North Livonia), (Saaremaa) and (Estonia), the first four cantons correspondings to today&#x27;s Latvia and the last three corresponding to today&#x27;s Estonia.

The first head of state of the United Baltic Duchy was to be Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg, not as a sovereign monarch, but as a subordinate to the German , similar to other princes or kings of the German Empire. However, Adolf Friedrich never assumed office. The appointed Regency Council, consisting of four Baltic Germans, three Estonians and three Latvians, functioned until 28 November 1918 without any international recognition except from Germany.

In October 1918, the Chancellor of Germany, Prince Maximilian of Baden, proposed to have the military administration in the Baltic replaced by civilian authority. The new policy was stated in a telegram from the German Foreign Office to the military administration of the Baltic: &quot;The government of the Reich is unanimous in respect of the fundamental change in our policy towards the Baltic countries, namely that in the first instance policy is to be made with the Baltic peoples&quot;.

== Independent Estonia and Latvia ==
On 18 November 1918, Latvia proclaimed its independence. August Winnig, the last representative of the German government, signed an agreement with representatives of the Estonian Provisional Government on handing over power in Estonian territory on 19 November. In Latvia, the Germans formally handed over authority to the Latvian national government, headed by Kārlis Ulmanis on 7 December 1918.

The was formed in 1919 largely by the leaders of the local Livonian and Curonian nobility, who had been the proponents of the United Baltic Duchy in 1918. Upon taking command of the , Major Alfred Fletcher, with the backing of the local nobility, began dismissing native Latvian elements and replacing them with Baltic Germans and troops. Concurrently, German officers assumed most of the command positions. In his book &quot;Vanguard of Nazism: The Free Corps Movement in Postwar Germany, 1918–1923&quot;, the author Robert G. L. Waite notes: &quot;By mid-February 1919, Latvians composed less than one-fifth of their own army&quot;. The United Kingdom backed down after it had recognised the gravity of the military situation, and the White Russian units and the moved on and captured Riga on 22 May 1919.

After the capture of Riga, the were accused of killing 300 Latvians in Mitau (Jelgava), 200 in Tuckum (Tukums), 125 in Dünamünde (Daugavgrīva) and over 3,000 in Riga. In June 1919, after taking part in the capture of Riga, General von der Goltz ordered his troops to advance not east against the Red Army, as the Allies had been expecting, but north against the Estonians. On 19 June 1919, the Iron Division and units launched an attack to capture areas around Wenden (Cēsis), the continued its advance towards the Estonian coast preparatory for a push on Petrograd. However, the was defeated by the 3rd Estonian Division, led by Ernst Põdder, and North Latvian Brigade at the Battle of Cēsis, 19–23 June 1919.

On the morning of 23 June 1919, the Germans began a general retreat toward Riga. The Allies again insisted for the Germans to withdraw their remaining troops from Latvia, and intervened to impose a ceasefire between the Estonians and the when the Estonians were about to march into Riga. Meanwhile, an Allied mission composed of British troops, under General Sir Hubert de la Poer Gough, had arrived in the Baltic to clear the Germans from the region and to organise native armies for the Baltic states.

== Aftermath ==
The defeat of Germany in World War I in November 1918, followed by the defeat in 1919 of the and German units of General Rüdiger von der Goltz in Latvia by the 3rd Estonian Division and the North Latvian Brigade, rendered any ideas for the creation of the United Baltic Duchy irrelevant.

To ensure its return to Latvian control, the was placed under British authority. After taking command of the in mid-July 1919, Lieutenant Colonel Harold Alexander, the future Alexander of Tunis, gradually dismissed the Baltic German elements. The Baltic nations of Estonia and Latvia were established as republics.

<doc id="297311" wikidata="Q481333" url="?curid=297311" title="Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 1956">
<text>Germany was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1956 with two songs: &quot;, written and performed by Walter Andreas Schwarz; and &quot;, composed by Lotar Olias, with lyrics by , and performed by Freddy Quinn. The German participating broadcaster on behalf of ARD, (NWRV), organised a national final to determine their two entries for the contest. &quot;&quot; was the first-ever entry from Germany performed in the Eurovision Song Contest. 

== Background ==
The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) was formed in 1950 among 23 organisations with the aim of the exchange of television programmes. Following the formation of the EBU, a number of notable events were transmitted through its networks in various European countries, such as Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom. Following this series of transmissions, a &quot;Programme Committee&quot; was set up within the EBU to investigate new initiatives for cooperation between broadcasters. The new European contest was subsequently approved at the EBU&#x27;s General Assembly in October 1955. A planning sub-group, was subsequently formed to build out the rules of the competition. The rules of the contest were finalised and distributed to EBU members in early 1956. Per the rules of the contest, each participating broadcaster submitted two songs into the contest. During a meeting held on 27 and 28 October 1955, the television program directors of the German broadcasting corporation ARD decided to participate in the contest and to organise a national final. Germany was subsequently included on the EBU&#x27;s list of seven countries whose broadcasters had signed up to partake in the contest. For the 1956 contest, NWRV held a national final to choose two German entries.

==Before Eurovision==
=== Grand Prix 1956 Eurovision ===
&quot;&quot;Grand Prix 1956 Eurovision&quot; – Schlager und Chansons&quot; was the national final held to determine the two songs that should represent Germany. It took place on 1 May 1956 at 20:00 CET (19:00 UTC) at the Großer Sendesaal of in Cologne and was broadcast on Deutsches Fernsehen. Initially, the final was planned to be held in Hamburg. It was produced by (NWRV), a cooperation of NDR and WDR, and directed by . The presenter was . 13 songs took part in the national final. The participants were chosen upon invitation from NWRV and other ARD broadcasters.

Initial plans foresaw that each ARD broadcaster submitted two songs and two artists for the national final until 1 February 1956.

In April 1956, several listings magazines finally announced a list of 11 performers who should sing the competing compositions: Lys Assia (nominated by SDR), Eva Busch (SWF), Angèle Durand, Margot Eskens (SFB), (NWRV), Margot Hielscher (BR), Bibi Johns (SDR), Rolf Baro (Radio Bremen), Walter Andreas Schwarz (HR), , and (NWRV). Freddy Quinn was not part of the announced list. Also not part of the list, (nominated by SWF) was named as a participating singer by a press report.

By the time the national final took place, Lys Assia had already been selected to represent Switzerland at Eurovision.

The artists were accompanied by the WDR Tanz- und Unterhaltungsorchester under the direction of . The running order was to be drawn by lot with director being able to overrule the order in case of imbalances. The running order as well as the titles of the participating songs are not known for a few exceptions: &quot;Im Wartesaal zum großen Glück&quot; was presented under the title &quot;Das Lied vom großen Glück&quot; in the national final. A song titled &quot;Ich bin so unmusikalisch&quot; reportedly took part. Lys Assia performed her song 13th (and last) in the running order. There was a rumour that she sang the song &quot;&quot; in the national final. However, this turned out to be incorrect, as she competed with this song in the .

Three French-speaking acts, among them Les Compagnons du zodiaque and Annie Cordy, singing in both German and French, were the interval acts.

A jury, which was watching the songs in a separate room on TV screens, decided the winning songs. The jury was composed by members of the general public with each ARD broadcaster sending one juror. It seems that the selection took place in two rounds, with a superfinal confronting a few songs chosen among the 13 entries from the first round.

The first two places were selected to represent Germany at the Eurovision Song Contest in Lugano: &quot;Das Lied vom großen Glück&quot;, written by Walter Andreas Schwarz (first place), and &quot;So geht das jede Nacht&quot;, written by and Lotar Olias (second). The songwriters of the winning entries were only revealed after the results. A trophy, which consisted of a transparent box filled with orchids, was given to the first place. The full results of the national final are not known. The song sung by Melitta Berg was reported to have finished in third place.
There have been speculations about whether the national final actually took place: Despite the fact that the show appeared in listings magazines, none of the named participants could recall having taken part in the national final. Margot Hielscher stated that, according to her documents, she was not in Cologne on 1 May 1956 but in Berlin for filming. However, reviews and articles about the national final were published in several German print media after the final, including &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;, &quot;Quick&quot; and &quot;&quot;, giving details about the jury and the winning songs.

Walter Andreas Schwarz, of Jewish origins, was a survivor of the concentration camps and had been working as an announcer for the BBC after World War II. Freddy Quinn was an Austrian national with an American father and sung his entry in rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll style. The first two German entrants, Walter Andreas Schwarz and Freddy Quinn, have therefore been interpreted as &quot;cosmopolitan representatives of a West Germany that was distancing itself from its Nazi past and embracing an Americanized present.&quot;

==At Eurovision==
Eurovision Song Contest 1956 took place at the in Lugano, Switzerland, on 24 May 1956. &quot;&quot; was, like in the national final, presented under the title &quot;Das Lied vom großen Glück&quot;. It was performed fourth and &quot;&quot; was performed eleventh in the running order, both following Belgium and preceding France&#x27;s two songs. Both of the German entries were conducted at the contest by Fernando Paggi.

Neither of the German songs won the contest, and the full results were not revealed and have not been retained by the EBU. In the German national final of 1982, co-presenter claimed that &quot;Im Wartesaal zum großen Glück&quot; had come second. Though the full results have never been made public, the claim has been repeated several times since.

Eurovision Song Contest 1956 was televised in Germany on Deutsches Fernsehen with commentary provided by Irene Koss. It was also broadcast live on Radio Bremen 2. Excerpts from the final in Lugano were broadcast on radio on 18 June 1956 at 23:00 CET, and on Radio München on 30 June 1956 at 20:15 CET.

<text>Li Lanqing (; born 22 May 1932) is a retired Chinese politician who served as first-ranked Vice Premier of China between 1998 and 2003. He was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) between 1997 and 2002, and a regular Politburo member from 1992 to 1997.

==Biography==
Born in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province, he initially worked at First Automobile Works. Li graduated from the Business Management Department of Fudan University in Shanghai in 1952. Then in 1956 he was sent to study in the Soviet Union, where he worked as an intern in two Moscow-based automobile factories. In 1959, he began working as a secretary at the First Ministry of Machine Building. In 1962, he began working as a secretary at the National Economics Commission. After the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, he was sent down to perform labor at a May Seventh Cadre School. In 1972, he resumed work at Dongfeng Motor Corporation. In 1978, he took part in the planning sessions for a &quot;Third Automobile Works&quot;. In 1981, after the Chinese economic reform began, Li was sent to work for the central government in Beijing, leading the Office of Foreign Government Debt at the State Foreign Investment Commission. In 1983 he was again transferred to Tianjin, where he worked under mayor Li Ruihuan as a vice mayor. Li later held positions in the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and the State Economic Commission. Li also served as director-general of the Foreign Investment Administration of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade. Li was also Executive Vice Minister and then Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade. Between 1997 and 2002, he was a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, the pinnacle of power in Chinese politics. While in government he was the first-ranked Vice-Premier, sometimes known as &quot;Executive Vice Premier&quot;. In his capacity as Vice Premier, Li was responsible for national education policy. He is the author of &quot;Education for 1.3 Billion: On 10 Years of Education Reform and Development.&quot; The book has sold more than 750,000 copies in China and has been translated into English. After retiring, Li practiced calligraphy. He also attempted to get a job as a shopkeeper at a local convenience store, but was ultimately not hired after being recognized by the owner. He lately attended the 20th Party Congress at age 90.

<text>Hemant Lakhani (1935 – June 19, 2013) was an Indian-born British rice trader and sari salesman. He was convicted in 2005 of illegal arms dealing after purchasing a fake surface-to-air missile from a Russian intelligence agent posing as a disgruntled military officer, then attempting to sell that missile to an informant working for FBI and posing as a Somali terrorist.

==Background==
Born in Gujarat, Lakhani moved to London in 1974. Lakhani and his wife Kusum ran a number of businesses, including an export/import business Multitrade (London) Ltd and Reliance Clothing Company Ltd.

==Investigations==
On 12 August 2003, as a result of a sting operation arranged as a result of cooperation between the American, British and Russian intelligence agencies, Lakhani was intercepted attempting to bring what he had thought was an older-generation Igla into the United States. He is said to have intended the missile to be used in an attack on Air Force One, the American presidential plane, or on a commercial US airliner, and is understood to have planned to buy 50 more of these weapons.

After the FSB detected the dealer in Russia, he was approached by US undercover agents posing as terrorists wanting to shoot down a commercial plane. He was then provided with an inert Igla by undercover Russian agents, and arrested in Newark, New Jersey, when making the delivery to the undercover US agent. An Indian citizen residing in Malaysia, Moinuddeen Ahmed Hameed and an American Yehuda Abraham who allegedly provided money to buy the missile were also arrested.

The extent of Lakhani&#x27;s background in Russia remains unknown, although one of his fellow directors in the Reliance Clothing Company is known to maintain a Moscow address. He was first noticed by the FSB in March 2003 and his past is presently being investigated by India&#x27;s Central Bureau of Investigation.

It is thought that he approached the Degtyaryov Plant to purchase the missile after researching the company on the internet. Due to a tip-off from MI6, the FSB agent posed as a representative of the company to sell him a disabled Igla missile.

There is some evidence that MI6 grew interested in him after he made contact with Ukrspetsexport, an arms company suspected of supplying illegal arms to Iraq.

===Criticism of American investigation===
U.S. government agents were continuously involved with Lakhani&#x27;s case, many claim to the point of entrapment. It is not clear that Lakhani, before allegedly being convinced by US agents, would have wished to obtain support for terrorism. It is also unclear whether Lakhani could ever have delivered on his promises of illegal arms to a government informant: When Lakhani was unable to obtain a missile, the U.S. government, acting through the intelligence community, provided him with one. Such counterterrorist strategies have been described by legal scholars as window dressing, because they target supposed enemies who are so weak as not to be a threat, and divert resources from addressing real threats.

In a 2006 article in &quot;The Nation&quot;, Christopher Hayes wrote,
Lakhani&#x27;s involvement with U.S. government agents and intelligence has been the subject of an episode of the public radio show &quot;This American Life&quot;, aired in 2005 and 2009.

==Conviction==
Lakhani was prosecuted by U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Chris Christie. He was convicted by jury in April 2005 of attempting to provide material support to terrorists, unlawful brokering of foreign defense articles and attempting to import merchandise into the U.S. by means of false statements, plus two counts of money laundering. He was sentenced to 47 years in prison, and died in 2013.

<text>Misti is a dormant volcano located in the Andes mountains in southern Peru, rising above Peru&#x27;s second-largest city, Arequipa. It is a conical volcano with two nested summit craters, the inner one of which contains a volcanic plug or lava dome with active fumaroles. The summit of the volcano lies on the margin of the outer crater and is above sea level. Snow falls on the summit during the wet season, but does not persist; there are no glaciers. The upper slopes of the volcano are barren, while the lower slopes are covered by bushland.

The volcano developed over four different stages. During each stage, lava flows and lava domes built up a mountain, whose summit then collapsed to form a caldera. The volcano is part of a volcano group with Chachani to the northwest and Pichu Pichu to the southeast, and developed on top of a basement formed by numerous Miocene-Pliocene ignimbrites and volcano-derived debris. Numerous intense explosive eruptions took place during the last 50,000 years and covered the surrounding terrain with tephra. The last two significant eruptions were 2,000 years ago and in 1440–1470 AD; since then, phases of increased fumarolic activity have sometimes been mistaken for eruptions.

Misti is one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world, as it lies less than from Arequipa. The city&#x27;s population exceeds one million people and its northeastern suburbs have expanded on to the slopes of the volcano. The narrow valleys on western and southern flanks are a particular threat, as mudflows and pyroclastic flows can be channelled into the urban area and into important infrastructure, like hydropower plants. Even moderate eruptions can deposit volcanic ash and tephra over most of the city. Until 2005, there was little awareness or monitoring of the volcano. Since then, the Peruvian INGEMMET has set up a volcano observatory in Arequipa, run public awareness campaigns on the dangers of renewed eruptions and published a hazard map. The Inca viewed the volcano as a threat and during the 1440–1470 eruption offered human sacrifices (&quot;capacocha&quot;) on its summit and that of its neighbours to calm the volcano down; the mummies on Misti are the largest Inca sacrifice known.

== Name and settlement history ==

The name is either Quechua or Spanish and means &quot;mixed&quot;, &quot;mestizo&quot; or &quot;white&quot;; it may refer to snow cover. The indigenous names are (&quot;mountain that growls&quot;) and in Aymara &quot;Anukara&quot; or (&quot;dog&quot;); they both refer to the dog-like appearance of the volcano when viewed from the Altiplano. The original name of the volcano was Putina; it only became known as &quot;Misti&quot; beginning in the 1780s. Other names for the volcano are Guagua-Putina, El Volcán (&quot;the volcano&quot;), San Francisco, and Volcán de Arequipa (&quot;the Arequipa volcano&quot;). Sometimes chroniclers confused it with other volcanoes like Ubinas and Huaynaputina.

Settlement of the region began about 1,500 years ago. It is unclear whether the Inka were the first Altiplano polities to influence the region or whether previous cultures played a role, but by the arrival of the Spanish the area was densely populated. The pre-Hispanic people built canals, roads and buildings in the area where Arequipa is today. The city itself was founded on 15 August 1540. Misti is the house mountain of Arequipa, appearing on the seal of the city for example.

=== Human geography ===

The old roads heading from Arequipa to Chivay and Juliaca run along the northern/western and southern/eastern foot of Misti, respectively. Inca roads from the Arequipa area passed by the volcano. There are numerous dams on the Rio Chili, including the Aguada Blanca Dam and reservoir north of the volcano, El Fraile, and Hidroeléctrica Charcani I, II, III, IV, V and VI. These dams have hydroelectric power plants which supply electricity to Arequipa. The river is also the principal water resource for the city. Roads leaving the city cross the river on bridges.

According to Italian geographer Cumin 1925, there were three small man-made structures of unknown origin in the crater. He noted that they were known since 1677. Inka ceremonial platforms on the summit associated with human sacrifices were probably destroyed by human activities around 1900 AD, although a ceremonial area was reported in 2024. Professor S. I. Bailey from the Harvard College Observatory in 1893 installed the world&#x27;s highest weather station on Misti. The station was one of several high-altitude stations built at the time, which aimed to investigate the atmosphere at such high altitudes; additionally, the Observatory performed research on the response of the human body to high altitudes and on the solar eclipse of April 16, 1893. Misti was in its time the highest permanently inhabited location on Earth. Another weather station, named &quot;Mt. Blanc Station&quot;, was installed at the base of the volcano after 1888. Both were shut down in 1901 when the Observatory decided to only maintain a station in Arequipa; subsequently storms have erased any trace of the summit observatory. Observation of physics phenomena, such as cosmic ray measurements, were sporadically carried out on Misti during the 20th century.

== Geography and geomorphology ==

Misti rises about above Arequipa, the second-largest city in Peru, and is the best known volcano of Peru. The Inka empire&#x27;s Condesuyos province included the volcano; presently it is in the Arequipa Department. The mountain is visible from the sea.

=== Regional ===

The volcanoes of Peru are part of the Andean Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ), one of the four volcanic belts of the Andes; the others are the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Southern Volcanic Zone and the Austral Volcanic Zone. The CVZ extends for from southern Peru through Bolivia to northern Argentina and Chile. Volcanoes are numerous in the CVZ, but most are poorly known due to the low population density of much of the Central Andes. Several Peruvian volcanoes have been active since the Spanish conquest: Andagua volcanic field, Huaynaputina, Sabancaya and Ubinas, and possibly Ticsani, Tutupaca and Yucamane. Other Peruvian volcanoes in the CVZ are Ampato, Casiri, Coropuna, Huambo volcanic field, Purupuruni and Sara Sara. Ubinas is the most active volcano in Peru, having erupted 24 times since 1550. The 1600 eruption of Huaynaputina claimed more than 1,000 casualties; recent eruptions of Sabancaya 1987–1998 and Ubinas 2006–2007 had severe impacts on the local populations.

=== Local ===

==== General outline ====

The volcano is a young, symmetric cone with 30° degree slopes and a nested summit crater. The outer crater has a diameter of or and is deep. There is a gap in the southwestern rim, almost to the bottom of the crater; otherwise the inner crater walls are nearly vertical and consist of lapilli, lava and volcanic ash. The and inner crater is in the southeastern part of the outer crater. The inner crater cuts across metre-thick ash and scoria deposits and historical lava domes and is rimmed by scoria. In the crater is a and volcanic plug/lava dome, covered with cracks, boulders and fumarolic sulfur deposits; it is fumarolically active. The highest point of the volcano is at on the northwestern outer crater rim; an iron cross marks the highest point. Other mountains of the Western Cordillera, including Ubinas and Pichu Pichu, can be seen from the summit.
The volcano is about wide and rises abruptly from the surrounding terrain. Estimates of the edifice&#x27;s volume range reach , but more likely its volume is only or . It is notably asymmetric, with the western side more heavily eroded and featuring older rocks than the eastern side. The western rim of the outer crater is about higher than the southern. Underneath the Misti cone is an older, eroded stratovolcano (&quot;Misti 1&quot;). The stratovolcano is made up of pyroclastic rocks and stubby lava flows, which form a pile. On the northwestern foot, there is a rhyolitic landform named &quot;Hijo de Misti&quot; (&quot;son of Misti&quot;). Misti is surrounded by a fan of volcanic debris, which covers an area of on Misti and extends from the volcano. On the southern side, the volcano is cut by ravines, while the northern side is flatter. Dune fields and volcanic ash deposits extend for northeast of Misti; they are formed by wind-blown ash. The terrain between Arequipa and Misti is initially gently sloping, before reaching the steep flanks of the cone.

There are no obvious traces of a sector collapse on the volcano, except on its western foot and a narrow chute on the northwestern flank of Misti that reaches its summit. Two debris avalanche deposits lie on the southeastern and southwestern-southern side of Misti, extending and from the volcano. The first is made up by hummock-shaped hills of mixed debris and covers an area of ; the second forms a flat-topped terrain with an area of about on both sides of the Rio Chili.

==== Hydrology and glaciology ====

The perennial Rio Chili rounds the northern and western sides of Misti, where it has cut the and Charcani Gorge. From southeast to southwest the Quebrada Carabaya, Quebrada Honda, Quebrada Grande, Quebrada Agua Salada, Quebrada Huarangual, Quebrada Chilca, Quebrada San Lazaro and Quebrada Pastores drain the edifice. They eventually join to the Rio Chili west and Rio Andamayo south of Misti; the Andamayo joins the Chili south of Arequipa. Quebrada San Lazaro and Quebrada Huarangual have formed alluvial fans at the foot of the volcano. The quebradas (dry valleys) carry water during the wet season in November–December and March–April.

During the wet season, snow can cover an area of on the upper cone. Unlike neighbouring Chachani, Misti lacks any evidence of glacial or periglacial processes, probably due to its inner heat. There is no clear indication of past glaciation, either, except possibly on the western flank. A thin ice cover may not have left traces on the volcano, however. The present-day snowline lies above elevation.

== Geology ==

=== Regional setting ===
Off the western coast of Peru, the Nazca Plate subducts under South America at a rate of . The subduction is responsible for the volcanism of the CVZ, as the downgoing slab releases fluids that chemically modify the overlying mantle, causing it to produce melts. Most Peruvian volcanoes have produced potassium-rich andesitic magmas, derived from the mantle and further modified by fractional crystallization and assimilation of material from the often thick crust.

Volcanic activity in southern Peru goes back to the Jurassic. Various volcanic arcs formed in Peru during the past 30 million years: The Tacaza Arc 30–15 million years ago, the Lower Barroso 9–4 million years ago, the Upper Barroso 3–1 million years ago and the Pleistocene-Holocene Frontal Arc during the past one million years. Two distinct episodes of uplift took place 24–13 and 9–4 million years ago, and were accompanied by the emplacement of numerous large ignimbrites.

During the Cretaceous-Paleogene, the Toquepala Group of volcanics was emplaced. The Tacaza Arc is the source of the Huaylillas Formation and the Barroso Group of the Sencca Formation. The Nazca fracture zone on the Nazca Plate projects under Misti.

=== Local setting ===
Misti is part of the Western Cordillera of the Andes. It is the youngest of a group of three Plio-Pleistocene volcanoes; the others are the dormant Chachani northwest and extinct Pichu Pichu southeast. This group lies at the margin of the Altiplano, next to the tectonic depression of Arequipa where the city lies. The depression has dimensions of and appears to be formed by fault activity. The terrain under Misti slopes south and this might make the edifice slip southward over time.

A northwest-southeast trending fault system includes the Huanca fault at Chachani and the Chili fault on Misti. The faults were active during the Holocene, offsetting tephra deposits, and may have provided a pathway for magma to ascend and form the volcanoes of Arequipa. Other faults include north- and northeast-trending faults, which are inactive but could have influenced the formation of the Rio Chili canyon. The crust under the volcano is thick.

=== Basement ===

The basement under Misti crops out in the Rio Chili gorge. It consists of Proterozoic rocks of the Arequipa Terrane, which are more than a billion years old, Jurassic sediments of the Socosani Formation and Yura Group, and the Cretaceous-Paleogene La Caldera batholith. The batholith forms the hills south of Arequipa. These formations are covered by rhyodacitic ignimbrites known as &quot;sillars&quot;. They are between 13.8 and 2.4 million years old; the older are part of the Huaylillas Formation and the younger of the Barroso Arc. Individual ignimbrites crop out in the Rio Chili gorge and include the thick Río Chili ignimbrite from 13.19 ± 0.09 million years ago, the 4.89 ± 0.02 million years old La Joya ignimbrite or &quot;sillar&quot;, the 1.65 ± 0.04 million years old Aeropuerto or Sencca ignimbrite, and the 1.02 million years old Yura Tuff and Capillune Formation. They were erupted from multiple calderas, one of which is now buried under Chachani. The ignimbrites are covered by volcanic sedimentary rocks and debris from the sector collapse of Pichu Pichu.

=== Composition ===

Misti has erupted mainly andesite, while dacite and rhyolite are less common. There are reports of trachyandesite erupted during the Holocene eruptions. Rhyolites and dacites are associated with explosive eruptions. The volcanic rocks are subdivided into several classes: Pyroxene-amphibole andesites, amphibole andesites, amphibole dacites and amphibole rhyolites; mica has also been reported. The rocks define a potassium-rich calc-alkaline suite typical for Peruvian volcanoes. Phenocrysts include amphibole, augite, biotite, enstatite, plagioclase and titanomagnetite. Magma composition has varied over time and the most recent volcanic stage has produced slightly different magmas, but overall the composition of Misti magmas is highly homogeneous. The composition of Misti magmas and these of its neighbours Pichu Pichu and Chachani resembles adakite, an unusual kind of volcanic rock formed by the direct melting of a subducting plate. Some rocks erupted by the volcano show evidence of hydrothermal alteration.

==== Magma genesis and storage ====

The formation of the magmas of Misti is a complicated process, involving the arrival of new magma, assimilation of crustal material, and fractional crystallization. Initially mantle-derived melts pool in a reservoir at the base of the crust, where they assimilate crustal material and undergo fractional crystallization. Afterwards they ascend to a shallower reservoir, where they interact with Proterozoic gneisses. Assimilation of basement rocks gave rise to the rhyolitic magmas erupted 34,000–31,000 years ago. Crystal-poor magma can form in the magmatic system through numerous processes and gives rise to the rhyolites and the volcanic plug. The existence of a third magma storage zone hosting mafic magmas at the base of the crust has been proposed.

It is not clear whether Misti has a single magma chamber or multiple magma reservoirs at depth, although the rock composition implies that only one large magma system is present. The reservoir appears to be located at depth and has a volume of several cubic kilometres. Every few millennia, a secondary rhyolitic reservoir forms at about depth; it was last reactivated during the eruption 2 ka ago. The magma system is periodically recharged, but such an influx of new magma does not trigger eruptions; instead multiple recharges are necessary to cause activity. Numerous mixing and decompression events can happen to each magma batch before it is erupted, with mixing particularly important during the last 21,000 years. A recharge of the magma chamber may have occurred at some point before 2000 AD. The overall rate of magma supply is , comparable to other stratovolcanoes in volcanic arcs, but with brief surges reaching about and an increased rate during the last 21,000 years.

== Eruption history ==

Misti is a young volcano. It developed in four stages, numbered 1 through 4; a pre-Misti volcano may have formed the southwestern debris avalanche. On average, sub-Plinian eruptions take place every 2,000–4,000 years, while ash fallout occurs every 500–1,500 years and large ignimbrite-producing eruptions every 20,000–10,000 years. Outcrops showing the stratigraphy of Misti are found mainly in the ravines on the southern side and the Rio Chili gorge; the older volcanic structures lie mainly in the western sector of Misti. Only a few eruptions have been thoroughly investigated. Seismic tomography has identified solidified buried magma bodies from the early stages of volcanism.

Long andesitic lava flows and ignimbrites, which reach a thickness of more than , form the oldest edifice. They have an age of 833,000 years, but it is not clear if they should be considered part of &quot;Misti 1&quot; or of a pre-Misti volcano. Sometimes, they are considered the first stage of Misti activity, with all the subsequent activity making up the second stage. After the south-southwestern collapse, the present stratovolcano began to grow 112,000 years ago. During the following 42,000 years lava flows and lava domes built an edifice with an elevation of , in the southern and eastern sectors of present-day Misti. During the subsequent 20,000 years, repeated collapses of lava domes deposited blocks, fallout deposits and scoria on the southern side of Misti and on Chachani to the northwest. Traces of glacial erosion like cirques, evidence of hydromagmatic activity and mudflows imply that Misti was glaciated during the first last glacial maximum of the Central Andes 43,000 years ago.

Between 50,000 and 40,000 years ago, the summit of Misti collapsed one or more times above elevation, forming a caldera. Intense pyroclastic eruptions yielded ignimbrites with volumes of , which cover an area of on the southern side of Misti. This activity brought &quot;Misti 2&quot; to an end; subsequently lava domes built &quot;Misti 3&quot; to an elevation of , almost entirely erasing the caldera. Between 36,000 and 20,000 years ago collapses of lava domes produced numerous block-and-ash flows of dacitic to andesitic composition, which reach thicknesses of several tens of metres on the southern side of Misti. The activity between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago has been christened &quot;Cayma stage&quot;, and several eruption deposits from this time have been named:
* 44,900-38,700 or 34,000–33,000 years old &quot;Fibroso I&quot;, also known as &quot;Cogollo&quot;.
* 43,200-38,300 years old &quot;Anchi&quot;.
* The 38,500-32,400 years old &quot;Sacarosa&quot;, &quot;Sacaroso&quot; or &quot;Sacaroide&quot; eruption produced two layers of pumice from a high eruption column. The total volume of tephra is about , equivalent to a volcanic explosivity index of 4 or 5. It was a two-stage event, with a change of magma dynamics or intensity occurring during the eruption.
* 37,100-30,500 years old &quot;Conchito&quot; or &quot;Fibroso II&quot;.
* 30,300-28,800 years old &quot;Chuma&quot;. Several additional eruptions took place between the &quot;Conchito&quot; and &quot;Chuma&quot; events.
* 15,000 years old &quot;Autopista&quot; produced three layers of (mostly) pumice with smaller quantities of lithics. During its eruption about of volcanic ash fell west of the volcano. The &quot;Autopista&quot; eruption with a volcanic explosivity index of 4 produced about of tephra; a similar eruption today would cover parts of Arequipa with of pumice. The &quot;Autopista&quot; deposit is the best preserved of the late Pleistocene tephra layers. 
* Deposits of eruptions after &quot;Autopista&quot; have been named according to two schemes: One spans the Pleistocene and Holocene and lists &quot;Blanco&quot;, &quot;La Zebra&quot;, &quot;Espuma gris&quot;, &quot;Espuma iridiscente&quot; and &quot;Rosado&quot;, the other includes tephra layers up to the 2ka eruption and lists &quot;Ponche Iridescente&quot;, &quot;Ponche Gris&quot;, &quot;Sandwich Inferior&quot;, &quot;Sandwich Superior&quot;, &quot;Sancayo&quot;, &quot;La Rosada&quot;, &quot;Apo&quot; and &quot;Misquirichi&quot;.

Eruptions 43,000 and 14,000 years ago dammed the Rio Socabaya and Rio Chili, forming temporary lakes south and north of the volcano that were later affected by earthquakes. Between 24,000 and 12,000 years ago ice fields formed on Chachani and Misti during the last glacial maximum; tephra fell on ice and was reworked by meltwater. Two eruptions 13,700 and 11,300 years ago produced pyroclastic surges that extended away from the volcano; a wide caldera formed at an elevation of .

=== Holocene ===

More than ten eruptions took place during the last 11,000 years, with only brief pauses in activity. The activity between 21,000 and 2,000 years ago is known as the &quot;Pacheco&quot; stage. Holocene activity filled the younger caldera with scoria and lava flows, forming the &quot;Misti 4&quot; edifice with the nested summit craters. Tephra forms thick deposits around the volcano, and pyroclastic surges reached distances of many kilometres more than 6,400 and 5,200 years ago. The 9,000 and 8,500 years old eruptions produced the &quot;Sándwich&quot; deposits. They extend for more than on the southwestern flank of Misti, but they also resulted in ash fall over the Pacific Ocean and Lake Titicaca. Radiocarbon dating has identified eruptions 8,140, 6,390, 5,200, 4,750, 3,800 and 2,050 years ago; the 3,800 eruption deposited fallout on Nevado Mismi more than northwest of Misti. The Global Volcanism Program lists eruptions in 310 BCE ± 100, 2230 BCE ± 200, 3510 BCE ± 150, 4020 BCE ± 200, 5390 BCE ± 75 and 7190 BCE ± 150.

==== 2 ka eruption and later activity ====

The last major explosive eruption – one or several events – took place about 2,000 years ago. The date is constrained to 2,060–1,920 years before present; ages of 2,300 BP are probably too old. The eruption produced about dense rock equivalents of rock and probably lasted a few hours. The eruption had a volcanic explosivity index of 4 or 5.

The eruption was probably triggered when fresh andesitic magma entered a pre-existent rhyolitic body. Magma rose through the edifice and expelled part of the hydrothermal system, causing initial phreatic eruptions. Tephra rained down around the edifice, with pumice falling from the volcano. Owing to magma mixing, the pumice deposits have an appearance resembling chocolate and vanilla swirls. Eventually, the conduit fully cleared and a high eruption column rose above the volcano. Pyroclastic flows emanated from the column and descended the southern flanks of the volcano, possibly through the gap in the crater rim. During the course of the eruption, collapses of the crater and conduit walls caused a temporary decline in the intensity of the column. The eruption column periodically collapsed and reformed, until the eruption ended with phreatomagmatic explosions.

Mudflows descended the mountain. The water source for the mudflows is unclear, but the eruption took place during the neoglacial between 2,500 and 1,000 years ago. Thus Misti may have featured a snow or ice cap at the time of the eruption; its melting would have given rise to mudflows. Rainfall generated further mudflows after the eruption. The relative importance of pyroclastic flows and mudflows during the 2 ka eruption is contentious. The outer summit crater probably formed during this eruption. Tephra layers in the Sallalli and (in this case with less certainty) Mucurca peat bogs close to Sabancaya, and (tentatively) for an ice core in the Antarctic Plateau in Antarctica, are attributed to this eruption. This is the only Plinian eruption during the Holocene.

After the 2 ka eruption, activity was limited to small Vulcanian eruptions, mudflows and tephra fallout, including scoria and volcanic ash. Dating has yielded ages of 330, 340, 520, 620, 1035 and 1,300 years before present for several such events. Mudflows took place 1,035 ± 45, 520 ± 25, 340 ± 40 and 330 ± 60 years ago and left thick deposits. Not all of these mudflows are associated with eruptions. Pyroclastic flows and ash falls were emplaced 1,290 ± 100 and 620 ± 50 years ago.

==== Historical activity and seismicity ====

The last eruption took place in AD 1440–1470 and produced about of ash. It was probably a prolonged eruption that lasted for months or years, depositing ash in the Peruvian Laguna Salinas and possibly as far as Siple Dome and Law Dome in Antarctica. It is the oldest eruption of a South American volcano for which historical records exist. The eruption was severe enough that Mama Ana Huarque Coya, the wife of the Inka emperor Pachacutec, came to Chiguata, where black ash had fallen, to provide assistance. There is no evidence that a supposed Inka settlement was destroyed by this eruption, but the local population fled and the Inka had to resettle the area. Along with other volcanic eruptions around that time and the beginning Spörer Minimum, the AD 1440–1470 eruption of Misti may have affected global climate conditions. In 1600, the volcano was covered by ash from the Huaynaputina.

There is no clear evidence of historical eruptions, while the Global Volcanism Program reports a last eruption in 1985. Mudflows descended the southern valleys until the 17th century. Phreatic eruptions may have taken place in 1577, on the 2 May 1677, 9 July 1784, 28 July 1787 and 10 October 1787. Questionable eruptions are recorded in 1542, 1599, August 1826, August 1830, 1831, September 1869, March 1870. They probably constitute fumarolic activity and often took place after heavy precipitation; the water would have infiltrated the edifice and evaporated from the volcanic heat. Comparisons between 1967 photos of the volcanic plug and more recent images show no changes.

The volcano is seismically active, with long-period earthquakes, tremors, &quot;tornillos&quot; and volcano-tectonic earthquakes recorded. The hypocentres, the actual sites of the earthquakes, are found within the edifice of Misti and cluster on the northwest flank of the volcano. The seismic activity appears to be linked to Misti&#x27;s hydrothemal system. Seismic swarms were recorded in August 2012, May 2014 and June 2014. No deformation of the volcanic edifice is evident in satellite images. Clouds rising from the mountain are sometimes mistaken for renewed activity.

== Hazards ==
Misti is Peru&#x27;s most dangerous volcano and one of the most dangerous in the world, owing to its proximity () to Arequipa, where more than a million inhabitants live. The city has expanded to within of the volcano, with new towns like Alto Selva Alegre, Mariano Melgar, Miraflores and Paucarpata and towns such as Chiguata getting within . About 8.6% of Peru&#x27;s GDP depends on Arequipa and would be impacted by future eruption of Misti. The city is constructed on mudflow and pyroclastic flow deposits of the volcano and all the valleys that drain Misti pass directly or indirectly through Arequipa. At least 220,000 people live on the alluvial fans and in the ravines on the southern side of Misti, and are threatened by floods, mudflows and pyroclastic flows emanating from the volcano that can be channelled through the ravines.

Individual threats from Misti include:
* There are few outcrops of tephra within Arequipa; however, this probably reflects erosion and the dense urban environment. The 2 ka and 1440–1470 AD eruptions deposited tephra over what today is Arequipa. Tephra fallout can cause health problems, pollute water resources, cause roofs to collapse, bury fields, and cause road accidents and accidents during cleanup. Much closer to the volcano, volcanic bombs can fall.
* Mudflows are mixtures of rocks and water. They are caused by rainfall or the melting of snow and ice; thus they can occur in the absence of volcanic activity. At Misti, they occur on average every century or two. Even small mudflows can reach the city and they bury and destroy everything in their path. Eruptions of Misti could generate mudflows on Chachani, thus threatening settlements that are on the other side of the Rio Chili.
* Pyroclastic flows are hot () masses of gas and rocks that can descend the slopes at speeds of ; they can flow over topographic obstacles and reach large distances from the volcanic vent. Pyroclastic flows and surges can reach from the volcano, although denser flows are likely to stop before reaching the city.
* The steep slopes put Misti at risk of sector collapses. Debris avalanches from the collapse of volcanoes can reach large distances, larger than that between Arequipa and Misti. Debris flows, like mudflows, can destroy everything in their path. Such collapses could also dam the Rio Chili, producing mudflows and threaten neighbourhoods like Vallecito, Av. La Marina and Club Internacional. Even small landslides on the western side of the volcano could threaten the water supply of Arequipa.
* Other threats are: Toxic gases can accumulate in closed spaces to dangerous concentrations, or interact with precipitation to form acid rains. Lava flows are highly destructive, but their slow speed means that they do not constitute a major threat to life.

Hazards at Misti are not limited to volcanism. During the wet season, Arequipa is frequently flooded. Heavy metals, presumably from Misti and Chachani, have been found in river water.

== Monitoring and hazard management ==

In 2001, there was neither emergency planning nor land use planning around Misti; the 2002–2015 development plan mentioned volcanic hazards but did not envisage any specific measures. The last eruption of Misti had taken place shortly before the foundation of Arequipa, and thus there is no memory of the hazards of volcanic activity, unlike the hazards of earthquake. Before the eruption of Ubinas in 2006–2007, volcanic hazards drew little attention from the Peruvian state and there was little awareness in Arequipa. The volcano is frequently considered a protective figure and not as a threat. A number of people associate volcanoes with lava flows and neglect other volcanic hazards.

Beginning in 2005, INGEMMET began monitoring volcanoes in Peru; the first monitoring equipment was targeted at the Charcani V hot spring. Later the monitoring was extended to other hot springs and to fumaroles in the crater; the latter both visually from Arequipa and in the crater. Monitoring of seismic activity commenced in 2005. Beginning in 2008 geodesic measurement stations were installed on the northeastern and southern slopes of the volcano. In 2012, a new monitoring station for the volcano was inaugurated. In May 2009 and April 2010, two exercise evacuations of several suburbs of Arequipa were carried out. In 2013, the Peruvian Volcano Observatory (OVI) was inaugurated in Arequipa; it monitors Misti, Ubinas, Ticsani and other Peruvian volcanoes. , the monitoring network on Misti includes seismometers, equipment that measures the composition and temperature of hot springs and fumaroles, and sensors for movements or deformations of the edifice. These efforts have yielded an increased awareness of the dangers posed by Misti, which is now being increasingly perceived as an active volcano. Efforts have been made to slow the growth of the northern suburbs of Arequipa, which are closest to Misti.

A volcano hazard map was developed in 2005 by numerous local and international organizations, and officially presented on the 17 January 2008. It defines three hazard categories: A red &quot;high risk&quot; zone, an orange &quot;intermediate risk&quot; zone and a yellow &quot;low risk&quot; zone. These are defined by the risk of debris flows, lava flows, mudflows, pyroclastic flows, and tephra fallout. The &quot;high risk&quot; zone encompasses the entire volcanic cone, its immediate surroundings and the valleys that emanate from it. Parts of Arequipa lie in the &quot;high risk&quot; zone. The &quot;intermediate risk&quot; zone surrounds the &quot;high risk&quot; zone, including the lower slopes of neighbouring mountains and most of the northeastern parts of Arequipa. The &quot;low risk&quot; zone in turn surrounds the &quot;intermediate risk&quot; zone and includes the rest of the city. Additional maps show areas at risk of tephra fallout and of being flooded by mudflows. The hazard map of Misti is the first hazard map of a Peruvian volcano. These maps serve to mitigate volcano hazards and to inform local development. A 3D map was published in 2018. In November 2010, the municipality of Arequipa decreed that the hazard map would have to be considered in future city zoning decisions.

=== Scenarios ===

Three different scenarios of future eruptions have been evaluated. The first envisages a small eruption, similar to recent activity at Sabancaya or the 1440–1470 AD eruption of Misti. Ash fall would occur around the volcano, reaching in the urban area and shutting down the Arequipa Airport, landslides could damage the dams on the Rio Chili, and mudflows would descend the southern slopes. The second scenario involves an eruption like the 2 ka eruption. Thicker ash falls (exceeding ) could cause buildings to collapse, and pyroclastic flows down the steep slopes south of Misti would reach the suburbs of Arequipa and Chiguata. Most risk assessments are based on these two scenarios.

The third scenario is a Plinian eruption like the &quot;Fibroso&quot; and &quot;Sacaroso&quot; events or the 1600 Huaynaputina eruption; pyroclastic flows would sweep all the flanks of Misti and past Arequipa, blocking the Rio Chili. Thick ash fall would occur over the entire region, including over the cities of El Alto, La Joya and agricultural areas. A Plinian eruption would require the evacuation of Arequipa. Other hazard scenarios are the emissions of short lava flows, the formation and collapse of lava domes and the collapse of part of the volcanic edifice.

== Fumarolic and geothermal system ==

Fumaroles on Misti occur in three locations: on the volcanic plug, the northern/northeastern walls of the inner crater, and on the southeastern flank of the volcano. They emit noises, visible clouds of water vapour and the smell of hydrogen sulfide. The smell reaches the crater rim, and, at times, the gas becomes so concentrated that it causes irritations to the eyes, nose and throat. Fumarolic activity has been reported since the 1440–1470 eruption. In 1948–1949 and 1984–1985 it was intense enough to be seen from Arequipa. The fumarolic activity is visible in satellite images as a temperature anomaly of about .

Water is the most important component of the fumarole gases, followed by carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen. The gases are highly acidic, containing hydrogen chloride and hydrogen sulfide. Fumarole temperatures have varied through the years, generally they are between with peaks of . The present-day (21st century) fumarole gases appear to derive directly from magma, with no interaction with a hydrothermal system. The fumaroles outside of the summit crater are colder, with temperatures of , and do not smell of sulfur.

Fumarolic vents are surrounded by concentric deposits of anhydrite close to the vent, gypsum at some distance, and sulfur in the colder vents. Other minerals are ammonium sulfate, hematite, ralstonite, soda alum and sodium chloride. Elemental compositions and isotope ratios indicate that the fumarole deposits are derived from the leaching of volcanic rocks and the water from precipitation. The chemistry of the deposits changed between 1967 and 2018, with decreasing zinc and increasing lead concentrations, concomitant with a warming of the fumarolic system that may be due to the arrival of new magma in the volcano during the 20th century. Sometimes the temperature of the fumaroles is high enough to melt the sulfur and the fumarolic gases can ignite.

Hot springs occur at the foot of the volcano. These include the Humaluso/Umaluso spring north and the Agua Salada, Bedoya/La Bedoya, Calle Cuzco, Charcani V, Chilina Norte, Chilina Sur, Jésus, Ojo de Milagro, Puente de Fierro, Sabandia, Tingo, Yumina and Zemanat south and southwest of Misti. The hottest of these is the Charcani V spring in the Rio Chili gorge; it is also the closest to the volcano, being only from the crater. The Jésus and Umaluso springs produce gas bubbles. The springs are fed by a low-temperature geothermal system that mostly produces alkaline waters containing bicarbonate, chloride and sulfate. Their waters appear to originate through the mixing of freshwater, magmatic water and chloride-rich deep water. Many of these springs form artificial pools or have water intakes, and several are monitored by INGEMMET for changes in activity.

High soil temperatures on the cone, hot springs and fumaroles indicate that Misti contains a hydrothermal system. Electric potential measurements indicate that the system appears to be confined between faults or to the older caldera. The activity has not been stable over time; after the 2001 southern Peru earthquake flow at the Charcani V spring and the temperature of the crater emissions increased noticeably. Water temperatures decreased after the 2007 Peru earthquake. Over time old fumarolic vents shut down and new vents develop, but the configuration of the dome vents is stable over time. The fumarolic activity is correlated to earth tides.

== Climate and vegetation ==

The region has a semi-arid climate with temperate temperatures; the annual mean temperature in Arequipa is . Temperatures decrease with elevation; in 1910 monthly mean temperatures at the summit ranged from in January to in May, June and August but in 1968 temperatures at the summit rose above freezing for a few days per year. During most of the year, dry westerly winds blow over the Western Cordillera except during summer months, when convection over the Amazon forces easterly flow that draws moisture to the Cordillera. Most precipitation falls during the austral summer (December to March) and amounts to , a 1910 study found most precipitation to be in the form of snow or hail. During the wet season, rainstorms and flash floods erode the volcanic debris deposits. The snow cover rapidly melts away during the dry season. The El Niño-Southern Oscillation and sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans govern annual rainfall. After a wet and cold start to the Holocene, the climate in the Western Cordillera may have been moist until 5,200–5,000 years ago, followed by a dry period that lasted until the 16th century AD when the Little Ice Age began.

The region west of the Andes, including the terrain at the foot of Misti, is mostly desert with cacti and dwarf shrubs as the principal vegetation forms. The vegetation belt is known as the &quot;Misti zone&quot;. There is an altitudinal gradation: vegetation is dominated by &quot;Franseria&quot; bushes between and by &quot;Diplostephium tacorense&quot; above . Other bushes occur mainly in creeks and valleys. At higher elevations, other genera such as &quot;Adesmia&quot; and &quot;Senecio idiopappus&quot; become more frequent, and at an elevation of about &quot;Lepidophyllum quadrangulare&quot; becomes the dominant plant. Cacti, herbs, yareta cushion plants, ichu (&quot;Jarava ichu&quot;), as well as pioneer species like lichens and mosses, are important above . &quot;Polylepis&quot; species form woodlands. Vegetation cover decreases above elevation.

Insects are the most important animals in the Peruvian mountains, and include beetles and hymenopterans. Birds include the Andean condor. 358 plant, 37 mammal and 158 bird species have been recorded in the region, including alpacas, guanacos, llamas and vicuñas. Most of the volcano is within the Salinas y Aguada Blanca National Reserve, which extends northwest of Misti and includes the volcano among its main attractions.

== Religious importance ==
The mountain was considered the &quot;apu&quot; and &quot;volcano of the city&quot;. It was venerated by the inhabitants of Arequipa, a common practice for inhabitants of the Andes. The Aymara people viewed it as an abode of deceased souls, with different regions regarding it as either a friendly or hellish final destination. According to the late 16th-century chronist Cristóbal de Albornoz, Misti was one of the important mountains (, a kind of deity or idol) of the Arequipa area of the Inka Empire, along with Ampato, Coropuna, Sara Sara and Solimana. This tradition probably originated with the previous inhabitants of the area and was taken over by the Inka when they conquered the region. The Middle Horizon Millo archeological site in the Rio Vitor valley was constructed in a manner that allowed a good view of Misti, which was probably the &quot;apu&quot; of this place. Petroglyphs at Toro Muerto may represent astronomical alignments of Misti and Chachani. 

The Inka gave the &quot;apus&quot; cups of gold and silver and settled people around Misti that would continue the mountain veneration. People used to alter the shape of the skulls of their infant children so that they resembled the volcano. Misti was considered to be an aggressive mountain that was always demanding sacrifices, and the mountain had to be exorcised in colonial times. After the Spanish conquest, the mountain was consecrated to St. Francis. According to the Jesuit College of Arequipa, &quot;Indian sorcerers&quot; thought that Huaynaputina had asked Misti for assistance in expelling the Spaniards; Misti however had turned down, saying it was already Christianized, so Huaynaputina had proceeded alone. During episodes of increased activity, the inhabitants of Arequipa carried out religious ceremonies, including public penance and flagellations, to discurage the volcano. A group of converts and Franciscans in 1600 climbed on Misti and threw saints&#x27; relics and a cross into its crater to discourage the volcano. Another expedition was launched in 1784, after an earthquake had destroyed Arequipa, and planted a cross on the summit. This cross was replaced twice: first a decade later and then in 1900. The cross on the summit of Misti supposedly protects the city. To this day, religious ceremonies are carried out on the volcano. Peasants believe that after offering gifts to Misti women will bear boys, while the same offers to Chachani will make them bear girls.

== Mummies ==

Eight or nine mummies were found on Misti by Johan Reinhard and José Antonio Chávez in 1998, inside the crater and below the summit. The mummies were of children, mostly boys around six years old. Unusually, the mummies were buried in shared tombs. Along with the mummies were figurines, ceramics and other objects; the high number of figurines found on Misti (47) indicates that the site was important to the Inkas. These mummies were Inka human sacrifices, so-called &quot;capacochas&quot;, and the Misti &quot;capacocha&quot; is the largest known. However, the hostile conditions within the crater had seriously damaged the mummies. They included infants and children, which were sometimes buried one on top of the other.

The sacrifices on Misti, and others on Chachani and Pichu Pichu, were probably motivated by the 1440–1470 eruption of Misti, which may explain the unusual location within the crater rather than on a summit. According to the 16th century chronicler Martín de Murúa, the Inka Thupa Yapanki sacrificed llamas to calm a volcano Putina close to Arequipa (probably Misti), going as closely as possible to the summit. Previous ceremonies had failed to calm the volcano and only the emperor&#x27;s direct intervention quelled its anger. This description however most likely refers to the 1600 eruption of Huaynaputina, rather than of eruptions at Misti.

== Climbing and recreation ==

Misti was first ascended by pre-Columbian people, who left archaeological evidence around the summit. The first documented ascent was by Álvaro Meléndez, a priest from Chiguata, in 1 May 1667. Numerous ascents of the volcano were made already during the 18th and 19th centuries. On July 9, 1988, U.S. cyclist Terry Powers went to the summit of El Misti with a mountain bike from the southern slopes and rode down the northern slopes. The iron cross on the summit was placed in 1784 and was still there a century later. The main ascent route according to mountaineer John Biggar is from the Aguada Blanca dam; a permit is needed to cross the dam. There are campsites at around elevation, accessible from the Aguada Blanca dam and the town of Chihuata south of Misti. The ascent to the summit takes about one long day. A less common route starts at Apurimac San Luis on the southern flank, through Tres Cruces and Los Pastores. Ascent from Chiguata takes a few days. The climbers reported difficulties due to the loose ground, noxious gases and altitude sickness, and John Biggar cautioned that there is no source of potable water on the mountain. 

The volcano is frequently visited by tourists, who come for the sight of the landscape surrounding Misti. Tourist activities at Misti include mountaineering and running down scree slopes. Ascents take place almost year-round.

<text>John Orley Allen Tate (November 19, 1899 – February 9, 1979), known professionally as Allen Tate, was an American poet, essayist, social commentator, and poet laureate from 1943 to 1944. Among his best known works are the poems &quot;Ode to the Confederate Dead&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Mediterranean&quot; (1933), and his only novel &quot;The Fathers&quot; (1938). He is associated with New Criticism, the Fugitives and the Southern Agrarians.

==Life==

===Early years===
Tate was born near Winchester, Kentucky, to John Orley Tate, a Kentucky businessman and Eleanor Parke Custis Varnell from Virginia. On the Bogan side of her grandmother&#x27;s family, Eleanor Varnell was a distant relative of George Washington; she left Tate a copper luster pitcher that Washington had ordered from London for his sister.

In 1916 and 1917 Tate studied the violin at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music.

===College and the Fugitives===
Tate entered Vanderbilt University in 1918. He was the first undergraduate to be invited to join a group of men who met regularly to read and discuss their poetry: they included John Crowe Ransom and Donald Davidson on the faculty; James M. Frank, a prominent Nashville businessman who hosted the meetings; and Sidney Mttron Hirsch, a mystic and playwright, who presided. Tate graduated Vanderbilt in 1922 with a B.A. &quot;magna cum laude&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa.

In 1922, the group began publishing a poetry magazine named &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, so the group was known as the Fugitives. Tate took along a younger friend to some meetings, sophomore Robert Penn Warren, who was invited to become a member in 1923. The aim of the group, according to the critic J. A. Bryant, was &quot;to demonstrate that a group of southerners could produce important work in the medium [of poetry], devoid of sentimentality and carefully crafted,&quot; and they wrote in the formalist tradition that valued the skillful use of meter and rhyme.

When Robert Penn Warren left Southwestern College to accept a position at Louisiana State University, he recommended Tate to replace him. Tate accepted the position, and spent 1934 through 1936 there as lecturer in English.

===1920s===
Tate made his debut as a critic in the weekly book page Davidson edited for the &quot;Nashville Tennessean,&quot; publishing 29 reviews there during 1924. The fifth book he reviewed was &quot;An Anthology of Verse by American Negroes,&quot; edited by Newman Ivey White and Walter Clinton Jackson--&quot;the first significant attempt&quot; by &quot;white critics to do justice to Negro literature in America.&quot; He faulted the editors&#x27; standards of &quot;refinement&quot; and &quot;taste.&quot; &quot;This of Claude McKay: &#x27;Some of his poems are too erotic for good taste and conventional morality.&#x27; Whose good taste and whose morality?&quot; It was easy &quot;to understand why they overlooked altogether the work of Jean Toomer. Toomer is the finest Negro literary artist that has yet appeared in the American scene, but he is interested in the interior of Negro life, not in the pressure of American culture on the Negro.&quot;

In 1924, Tate moved to New York City where he met poet Hart Crane, with whom he had been corresponding for some time. Over a four-year period, Tate worked freelance for &quot;The Nation&quot;, and contributed to the &quot;Hound &amp; Horn&quot;, &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine, and others. To make ends meet, he worked as a janitor.

During a summer visit with the poet Robert Penn Warren in Kentucky, he began a relationship with writer Caroline Gordon. The two lived together in Greenwich Village, but moved with Crane to a house in Patterson, New York, near &quot;Robber Rocks,&quot; the home of friends Slater Brown and Sue Brown. Tate married Gordon in New York in May 1925. Their daughter Nancy was born in September. In 1928, along with other New York City friends, Tate went to Europe. In London, he visited with T. S. Eliot, whose poetry and criticism he greatly admired, and he also visited Paris.

In 1928, Tate published his first book of poetry, &quot;Mr. Pope and Other Poems&quot;, which contained his most famous poem, &quot;Ode to the Confederate Dead&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;&quot; by the poet Henry Timrod). That same year, Tate also published the biography &quot;Stonewall Jackson: The Good Soldier&quot;. Later he became tired of the &quot;Ode.&quot;

Just before leaving for Europe in 1928, Tate described himself to John Gould Fletcher as &quot;an enforced atheist&quot;. He later told Fletcher, &quot;I am an atheist, but a religious one — which means that there is no organization for my religion.&quot; He regarded secular attempts to develop a system of thought for the modern world as misguided. &quot;Only God,&quot; he insisted, &quot;can give the affair a genuine purpose.&quot; In his essay &quot;The Fallacy of Humanism&quot; (1929), Tate criticized the humanists of his time for creating a value system without investing it with any identifiable source of authority. &quot;Religion is the only technique for the validation of values,&quot; he wrote. Although he was attracted to Roman Catholicism, he deferred converting. Louis D. Rubin, Jr. observes that Tate may have waited &quot;because he realized that for him at this time it would be &quot;only&quot; a strategy, an intellectual act&quot;.

In 1929, Tate published a second biography, &quot;Jefferson Davis: His Rise and Fall&quot;.

===1930s===
After two years abroad, the Tates returned to the United States in 1930. During two months in New York, Tate secured a publisher for a symposium on the South and agrarianism that he and Ransom, Davidson, Andrew Lytle, and others had been planning. In Tennessee, the Tates took up residence at Benfolly in Clarksville, Tennessee| an antebellum mansion with a 185-acre estate attached. Allen&#x27;s brother Ben Tate, &quot;who had made a lot of northern money out of coal.&quot;, purchased the house for them. House guests at Benfolly were frequent: Ford Madox Ford, Edmund Wilson, Louise Bogan, Phelps Putnam, Stark Young, the Howard Bakers, the Malcolm Cowleys, the Ransoms, the Warrens.

Meeting at Benfolly and in Nashville, Tate, Ransom, Davidson et al. completed work on their symposium, &quot;I&#x27;ll Take My Stand&quot; by Twelve Southerners, published in 1930. Tate didn&#x27;t like the title; he had argued for &quot;Tracts Against Communism.&quot; His contribution was &quot;Remarks on the southern Religion&quot;: the Old South was a feudal society &quot;without a feudal religion&quot;; her Protestant &quot;religious mind was inarticulate, dissenting, and schismatical.&quot;

In 1933 Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder and editor of &quot;Hound &amp; Horn&quot;, wrote Tate, the Southern editor, that he &quot;would like very much to know what all you people think could be done in relation to black and white.&quot; . . . Was the friction &quot;inevitably racial, or accidentally economic?&quot; Why were sexual relations between a white man and a black woman tolerated but not the reverse? Tate stated that there was &quot;absolutely no &#x27;solution&#x27; to the race problem in the South. That is, there is no solution that will remove the tension and the oppression that the negro must feel. . . . When two such radically different races live together, one must rule. I think the negro race is an inferior race.&quot; The key was social order, which served not social justice but &quot;legal justice for the ruled race. . . . Liberal agitators&quot; deprived &quot;the negro of even the legal justice.&quot; Liberal policy was like &quot;that of the Reconstruction, . . . a steady campaign against the Southern social system . . . to crush absolutely the remaining power of independent agriculture.&quot; As for the sexual question, &quot;it is upon the sexual consent of women that the race depends for the future. . . . Under the industrial capitalist regime . . . women are no longer the very center of the social system. . . . What is to be done about all this I do not know; and I am inclined to think no one else knows.&quot; 
During this time, Tate also became the &quot;de facto&quot; associate editor of &quot;The American Review&quot;, which was published and edited by Seward Collins. Tate believed &quot;The American Review&quot; could popularize the work of the Southern Agrarians. He objected to Collins&#x27;s open support of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, and condemned Fascism in an article in &quot;The New Republic&quot; in 1936. Much of Tate&#x27;s major volumes of poetry were published in the 1930s, and the scholar David Havird describes this publication history in poetry as follows: 

Ford dedicated his book &quot;Provence&quot; to Gordon and Tate writing &#x27;who came to Provence and there wrote to &quot;That Sweet Land&quot; the poem called &quot;The Mediterranean&quot; and where we went in the boat was a long bay&quot;.

Tate and Herbert Agar in 1936 put together a symposium entitled &quot;Who Owns America? A New Declaration of Independence&quot; (Houghton Mifflin); the 21 contributors included eight Agrarians, three economists, a woman psychologist, and an English Distributist. The book made the bestseller list; it was reissued in 1999 by ISI Books. In 1936 also Scribner&#x27;s published Tate&#x27;s &quot;Reactionary Essays on Poetry and Idea&quot;; Maxwell Perkins, editor to both Tate and Gordon, told Tate, &quot;It is an honor to publish this book.&quot;

In 1938 Tate published his only novel, &quot;The Fathers&quot;, which drew upon knowledge of his mother&#x27;s ancestral home and family in Fairfax County, Virginia.

===1940s===
Tate was the poet-in-residence at Princeton University from 1939 to 1942, and founded the university&#x27;s Creative Writing Program. He established the Mesures Lectures. During 1940 through 41 he was also a regular panelist, with Mark Van Doren and Huntington Cairns, on the popular CBS radio program &quot;Invitation to Learning&quot; and sometimes a guest the following year. Random House published the transcripts.

The Tates moved to Monteagle, Tennessee in 1942 to write, living on publishers&#x27; advances (Gordon was a novelist). Robert Lowell and Jean Stafford joined them. Lytle was teaching history at the nearby University of the South and was made editor of the &quot;Sewanee Review&quot; for a year; Tate helped him by getting poems and articles from Wallace Stevens, William Meredith (poet), and others.

In 1943 Tate was appointed the first rotating Chair of Poetry at the Library of Congress, where he established the Associate Fellows in American Letters. He initiated recordings of 16th and 17th century English lyrics and modern American poetry from Emily Dickinson to Karl Shapiro for Books for the Blind. He reviewed Shapiro&#x27;s first book of poems, &quot;Person, Place and Thing&quot;, for the magazine &quot;Common Sense&quot; in 1943, writing the review as a letter to Sgt. Shapiro, then stationed in Australia, mixing some compositional advice with high praise (&quot;May I list here certain poems that for me are already placed among the best poetry of our time?&quot;), and beginning a long friendship. Tate was known for his aid to talented younger writers: John Berryman, Joseph Frank (writer), Robert Lowell, William Meredith Jr, Howard Nemerov, Delmore Schwartz, and Peter Taylor.

Tate edited the &quot;Sewanee Review&quot; from 1944 to 1946. Publishing Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, Jacques Maritain, T. S. Eliot, John Peale Bishop, Malcom Cowley, Mark Van Doren, Randall Jarrell, R. P. Blackmur, John Berryman, Dylan Thomas, Peter Taylor, and others, he greatly increased the magazine&#x27;s circulation and made it one of the foremost quarterlies in the English language.

Tate and Gordon were divorced in 1945 and remarried in 1946. Though devoted to one another for life, they could not get along and would divorce again in 1959. 
Divorced and remarried, the Tates lived in New York from 1946 to 1951. Tate published &quot;Poems 1922–1947.&quot; It included the long &quot;Seasons of the Soul,&quot; written during World War II, which he valued more highly than the &quot;Ode.&quot; He was editor of &quot;belle lettres&quot; at Henry Holt and Co. for two years and a lecturer at New York University for four years. Tate received an honorary Litt.D. from the University of Louisville in 1948 and was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago in 1949. He was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1949. Tate would try without success until the end of his life to get Gordon elected to the Institute.

===1950s===
In 1950, Tate converted to Roman Catholicism. His godfather was the philosopher Jacques Maritain, who had been his friend at Princeton for several years. Gordon had joined the Church in 1947. Following the Tates into the Church later were their daughter and son-in-law, Nancy and Percy Wood; their Tennessee friends Brainard Cheney and his wife Frances; and their friend George Frederick Morgan, Tate&#x27;s former Princeton student and editor of the &quot;Hudson Review.&quot; He had a significant correspondence with Catholic nun, literary critic and poet M. Bernetta Quinn.

In 1951, six weeks after his baptism, Tate, writing &quot;as a Catholic,&quot; published a letter in &quot;The New York Times&quot; objecting to Cardinal Francis Spellman&#x27;s banning the Italian film &quot;The Miracle&quot;. Maritain told him, &quot;Only you would have had the nerve to fight Spellman.&quot; The Supreme Court in 1952 struck down New York State&#x27;s ban of &quot;The Miracle&quot;, Justice Felix Frankfurter citing Tate&#x27;s letter to the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

When Warren resigned from the University of Minnesota to go to Yale in 1951, the university offered the position to Tate. Tate was one of six U.S. delegates in 1952, including William Faulkner, Katherine Anne Porter, and W. H. Auden, to the Congress for Cultural Freedom in Paris. Later in 1952, the U.S. State Department sent Tate to the UNESCO Conference on the Arts in Venice; in Rome he had an audience with Pope Pius XII. He was a Fulbright Lecturer in Rome, 1953–54, and was the first Writer in Residence at the American Academy there. Tate was awarded honorary Litt. D. degrees by Coe College (1955) and Colgate University (1956). 
Tate was awarded the Bollingen Prize for Poetry for 1956. During the summers he taught at Harvard University and Brandeis University. In 1958 he was awarded the Christian Culture Gold Medal in Canada &quot;as an outstanding lay exponent of Christian ideals.&quot; He was a Fulbright Lecturer at the University of Oxford and the University of Leeds, 1958–59.

In 1959, Gordon was granted a divorce from Tate in Minneapolis on grounds of desertion. Tate four days later married the poet Isabella Gardner (1915–1981) in Wellfleet, Massachusetts. His friend Francis Biddle, the attorney general under President Franklin Roosevelt, was best man. In Minneapolis Tate had been living in the Oak Grove Hotel; Gardner bought and furnished a house. Her two children from two previous husbands lived with them from time to time.

&quot;Homage to Allen Tate,&quot; honoring his 60th birthday, was published in the Autumn 1959 &quot;Sewanee Review&quot;, including contributions by Ransom, Lytle, Cowley, Eliot, Blackmur, Porter, Van Doren, Davidson, and Lowell.

===1960s===
&quot;&#x27;Allen Tate Reads from His Own Works&#x27;&quot; helped launch the Yale Series of Recorded Poets in 1960. That year Tate edited &quot;Selected Poems of John Peale Bishop&quot; (Chatto &amp; Windus), and &quot;The Fathers&quot; was reprinted (Eyre &amp; Spottiswood and Swallow). The &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; said it was &quot;possibly one of the great novels of our time&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Encounter&quot; and the &quot;New Statesman&quot; published long review-articles by Frank Kermode and Janet Adam Smith. Tate said, &quot;The British read the book as I conceived it--not as &#x27;another Southern novel.&#x27;&quot; He received an honorary Litt.D. from the University of Kentucky in 1960.

Tate published &quot;Poems&quot; in 1960, adding two poems in terza rima, &quot;The Swimmers&quot; and &quot;The Buried Lake.&quot; T. S. Eliot said Tate&#x27;s were the best terza rima poems in English.

The Tates were invited to the inauguration of John F. Kennedy in 1961. First Lady Jaqueline Kennedy told Tate, &quot;Oh, I took your picture!&quot; (she had once been a newspaper photographer). Tate was awarded the Brandeis Creative Arts Medal in Poetry in 1961 for lifetime achievement.

When the issue of racial integration came to a new crisis in riots in 1962 at the University of Mississippi, Tate, Davidson, Warren, and Charlie Foster, Tate&#x27;s colleague and close friend from New England, exchanged views. Tate was &quot;in favor of Negro rights&quot; but thought &quot;the Supreme Court has gone about it from the wrong end. The vote is the thing; school integration, even for those who want it, will never be solidly based without the Negro vote.&quot; He was annoyed &quot;that the Southern Way of Life becomes a popular cause only when race relations are upset.&quot;

Italians awarded Tate the Dante Alighieri Society&#x27;s Gold Medal for 1962. Carleton College awarded him an honorary Litt.D. in 1963.

The Tates spent their summer vacations in England and Italy, seeing among others the Eliots, Louis MacNeice, Yvor Richards, W. H. Auden, Graham Greene, the Joseph Franks, Edith Sitwell, the Herbert Reeds, the Roy Fullers, the C. Day Lewises, and the Stephen Spenders, who gave them a cocktail party in 1962. Isabella met Natasha Spender, with whom Tate had had an affair. Tate remained friends with the Spenders until his death as well as with Elizabeth Hardwick, his other serious affair during his marriage with Gordon.

Tate brought &quot;a procession of distinguished visitors to Minneapolis,&quot; Charlie Foster said, and the cocktail parties the Tates had for them allowed faculty and sometimes graduate students to meet them: it was &quot;a kind of salon.&quot;

Isabella gave a large dinner party for Tate&#x27;s 65th birthday, inviting 26 guests. Tate was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, which had only 50 members, in 1964. He was the subject of a long illustrated article leading off the arts section of the Sunday Minneapolis &quot;Star&quot; &quot;Tribune&quot; for Jan. 24, 1965. It said Tate &quot;is one Southern conservative who is not enamored with Barry Goldwater. &#x27;Goldwater is a fine example of the complete decay of conservatism,&#x27; Tate said, his oversize head shaking sadly. &#x27;I&#x27;d prefer the welfare state to his caricature.&#x27;&quot;

Tate moved back into the Oak Grove Hotel after Gardner learned that he had been having an affair with a graduate student, Helen Heinz, a nun who was assistant director of nursing at a county hospital. He edited a special Eliot issue of the &quot;Sewanee Review&quot;, which was reissued as a book in 1966, &quot;T.S. Eliot, the Man and His Work.&quot; He was named the first Regents Professor of English at Minnesota. Gardner divorced Tate in March 1966; he and Helen were married in July in Tennessee.

Tate was a visiting professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, fall 1966, and at Vanderbilt University, spring 1967. For Francis Biddle&#x27;s 80th birthday dinner in Washington, Tate delivered a greeting speech in Latin. He sold his papers to the Firestone Library at Princeton; the proceeds would help build a new house for his retirement at Sewanee. Twin sons, John and Michael, were born prematurely to the Tates in Nashville in August 1967.
Tate was elected president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. He delivered the principal address at Ransom&#x27;s 80th birthday celebration at Kenyon College. Upon his retirement from Minnesota in June 1968 the family moved to Sewanee.

While the Tates were at Lytle&#x27;s for dinner one evening in July 1968, the babysitter allowed Michael to choke to death in his crib on a toy telephone while she was running him a bath. Walter Sullivan, in his memoir of Tate, claims that the Tates broke off contact with Andrew Lytle afterwards. Robert Lowell commemorated the infant boy&#x27;s death in his poem &quot;Michael Tate: August 1967–July 1968&quot;.

Tate resigned as president of the National Institute in November 1968 because of the tiring trips to New York. He edited &quot;The Complete Poems and Selected Criticism of Edgar Allan Poe&quot; (New American Library) and published &quot;Essays of Four Decades&quot; (Swallow and Oxford). He received an honorary D.Litt. from University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1969. In December another son was born, Benjamin Lewis Bogan Tate.

=== 1970s ===
Tate gave the annual Joseph Warren Beach Memorial Lecture at the University of Minnesota in 1970 and read at the Poetry International Festival in London. He and Helen spent two weeks in Italy; in Florence he attended the dinner celebrating Alfredo Rizzardi&#x27;s translation of &quot;Ode to the Confederate Dead and Other Poems&quot;. He received an honorary D.Litt. from the .

Tate published &quot;The Swimmers and Other Selected Poems&quot; (Oxford and Scribners) in 1971. He lectured at UNC Greensboro for two weeks in 1970 and 1971 and at Harvard for four days in 1971. He was earning as much as he could by lecturing because the annuity his brother Ben left him would expire after his death. He had to cancel his Hopwood Awards Lecture at the University of Michigan in 1972 when he was hospitalized at the Vanderbilt Hospital for ten days with bronchitis and emphysema; Gordon substituted for him.

David McDowell at Crown Publishers recommended Tate to the Nobel Prize Committee in literature.

Tate received a medal for distinction in literature from the University of South Carolina. He was sick when he delivered the three Gauss Lectures for 1973 at Princeton; he collapsed afterwards and was in the hospital at Princeton for ten days with emphysema. In 1974 Tate gave a lecture at the Library of Congress on the centenary of Robert Frost&#x27;s birth.

Tate&#x27;s 75th birthday was celebrated two days at Sewanee and one evening in London. At Sewanee the program included Denis Donoghue, Cleanth Brooks, Howard Nemerov, William Jay Smith, Radcliffe Squires, Walter Sullivan, Louis Rubin, and Lewis Simpson. Tate wasn&#x27;t allowed to attend the public events but, though weak, was engaging and witty at the social events which included his friends Eudora Welty, Joseph Frank, Francis Fergusson, and others. In London at the Mermaid Theatre Stephen Spender presided at a panel including I. A. Richards, Roy Fuller, and Robert Lowell, followed by a party in the Green Room.

Tate was hospitalized at Vanderbilt Hospital for three weeks in 1975 following a coma; he was now bedridden. His &quot;Memoirs and Opinions, 1926-1974&quot;, was published by Swallow. He received the Ingram Merrill Foundation&#x27;s Award in Literature for 1975. In 1976 he was awarded the National Medal for Literature; William Jay Smith accepted it for him.

The Tates moved to Nashville to be near Allen&#x27;s lung specialist. They took a vow of celibacy and were received back into the Church. Tate had numerous visitors to his small room; on the walls were pictures of Ransom and Eliot, &quot;my two masters.&quot; He was connected to an oxygen tank. &quot;Collected Poems, 1916-1976&quot; was published in 1977 by Farrar, Straus, &amp; Giroux. It was awarded the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize for the best book of poems in 1977.

Tate died in the Vanderbilt Hospital February 9, 1979. He was buried at Sewanee.

==Attitudes on race==
Literary scholars have questioned the relationship between the cultural attitudes of Modernist poets on issues such as race and the writing produced by the poets. The 1930s saw Tate&#x27;s most notable stances on matters that may or may not be connected to literary craft. For example, though Tate spoke well of the work of fellow Modernist poet Langston Hughes, in 1931, Tate pressured his colleague Thomas Dabney Mabry, Jr., into canceling a reception for Hughes, comparing the idea of socializing with the black poet to meeting socially with his black cook. John L. Grigsby describes Tate as a rare &quot;nonracist equalitarian&quot; among the Southern Agrarians.
In the 1930s Tate held prejudices against blacks. He expressed views against interracial marriage and miscegenation and refused to associate with black writers (like Langston Hughes). Tate also believed in white supremacy. Underwood (p. 291) doesn&#x27;t, however, quote Lincoln Kirstein&#x27;s reply to Tate&#x27;s letter (see the 1930)s: &quot;The most lucid and carefully thought out attitude that I have ever seen in regard to the whole business.&quot; 
According to the critic Ian Hamilton, Tate and his co-agrarians had been more than ready at the time to overlook the anti-Semitism of the &quot;American Review&quot; in order to promote their &#x27;spiritual&#x27; defense of the Deep South&#x27;s traditions. In a 1934 review, &quot;A View of the Whole South&quot;, Tate reviews W. T. Couch&#x27;s &quot;Culture in The South: A Symposium by Thirty-one Authors&quot; and defends racial hegemony: &quot;I argue it this way: the white race seems determined to rule the Negro race in its midst; I belong to the white race; therefore I intend to support white rule. Lynching is a symptom of weak, inefficient rule; but you can&#x27;t destroy lynching by fiat or social agitation; lynching will disappear when the white race is satisfied that its supremacy will not be questioned in social crises.&quot;

According to David Yezzi, who teaches at Johns Hopkins University, Tate held the conventional social views of a white Southerner in 1934: an &quot;inherited racism, a Southern legacy rooted in place and time that Tate later renounced.&quot; Tate was born of a Scotch-Irish lumber manager whose business failures required moving several times per year, Tate said of his upbringing &quot;&quot;we might as well have been living, and I been born, in a tavern at a crossroads.&quot; However, his views on race were not passively incorporated; Thomas Underwood documents Tate&#x27;s pursuit of racist ideology: &quot;Tate also drew ideas from nineteenth-century proslavery theorists such as Thomas Roderick Dew, a professor at The College of William and Mary, and William Harper, of the University of South Carolina — &quot;We must revive these men, he said.&quot; In the 1930s Tate was infuriated when another writer implied that he was a fascist.

<text>Phaistos (, ; Ancient Greek: , , Linear B: &quot;Pa-i-to&quot;; Linear A: &quot;Pa-i-to&quot;), also transliterated as Phaestos, Festos and Latin Phaestus, is a Bronze Age archaeological site at modern Faistos, a municipality in south central Crete. It is notable for the remains of a Minoan palace and the surrounding town.

Ancient Phaistos was located about east of the Mediterranean Sea and south of Heraklion. Phaistos was one of the largest cities of Minoan Crete. The name Phaistos survives from ancient Greek references to a city on Crete of that name at or near the current ruins.

== History ==

===Bronze Age===
Phaistos was first inhabited around 3600 BCE, slightly later than other early sites such as Knossos. During the Early Minoan period, the site&#x27;s hills were terraced and monumental buildings were constructed on them. Like other large Minoan cities, there was a palace that was built in an area that had been used earlier for communal feasting. The palace was built on a hill in the East and an acropolis was built on a hill in the West. The first palace was built in the Middle Minoan IB period, around 2000 BCE. The initial palace was destroyed and rebuilt three times in a period of about three centuries. The palace history is divided into three construction phases because of its reconstructions. The palace was destroyed around 1400 BCE and not rebuilt. This destruction may have been caused by a large earthquake.

Phaistos was interconnected to various other residences, most notably Hagia Triada and Gortyn. Hagia Triada has a smaller palace which may have been connected to the rulers of Phaistos as a vacation residence. Hagia Triada&#x27;s port and relative closeness to Phaistos may have allowed for long distance trade and shared economic and political activity. Phaistos was one of the 3 largest cities of Minoan Crete along with Knossos and Malia. A road system connects the cities and the road from Phaistos to Knossos seems to the most prominent. This indicates that trade and transportation between the two cities was important, and that Phaistos was a valuable trade partner.

Several artifacts with Linear A inscriptions were excavated at this site. The name of the site also appears in partially deciphered Linear A texts and may be similar to Mycenaean &#x27;PA-I-TO&#x27; as written on 62 Linear B tablets found at Knossos. Several kouloura structures (subsurface pits) have been found at Phaistos. Pottery has been recovered at Phaistos from in the Middle and Late Minoan periods. Bronze Age works from Phaistos include bridge spouted bowls, eggshell cups, tall jars and large pithoi. Grape pips have been found in storage vessels at Phaistos, indicating the production of wine.

===Classical and Roman era===

The site was reinhabited during the Geometric Age (8th century BCE). Phaistos had its own currency, the stater. The city also created an alliance with other autonomous Cretan cities, and with the king of Pergamon Eumenes II. Around the end of the 3rd century BCE, Phaistos was destroyed by the Gortynians and since then has not been present in the history of Crete. Scotia Aphrodite and goddess Leto, who was also called Phytia, were worshiped there. Epimenides, the wise man invited by the Athenians to clean the city after the Cylonian affair (Cyloneio agos) in the 6th century BCE, was a Cretan who may have descended from the people of Phaistos.

== Palace ==

Phaistos is home to one of the structures commonly known as a Minoan Palace. The structure of Minoan palaces differs from actual palaces and have been proven to serve more purposes, but the name has stuck. These structures are complex buildings that have multiple uses. The palace at Phaistos seemed to have religious and political purposes as well as sections for storage, housing, and a theater.

The Minoan Palace at Phaistos was destroyed and rebuilt multiple times. The earliest iteration of the palace was used as a foundation for the newer reconstructions. The new reconstructions of the palace shifted around slightly eastward of the original palace. The reconstructions of the palace expanded on the first build and were made on multiple vertical levels that were interconnected by halls and stairs. The palace was around 2/3 as large as the palace at Knossos.
The first level contained the theater area and some shrines. The theater was larger than the one at Knossos. The second level consisted of servant and guest rooms as well as the commissariat quarter. Above this was the primary royal apartments. The fourth and final level was made up of the Hall of the State and balconies that overlooked the palace and its exterior.

The levels of the theater area, in conjunction with two staircases, gave access to the main hall of the propylaea through large doors. A twin gate led directly to the central courtyard through a wide street. The floors and walls of the interior rooms were decorated with plates of sand and white gypsum stone. The upper floors of the west sector had spacious ceremonial rooms.

The entrance from the central courtyard led to the royal apartments in the northern section of the palace, with a view of the tops of Psiloritis (Mount Ida). The rooms were constructed from alabaster and other materials. The rooms for princes were smaller and less luxurious than the rooms of the royal departments.

A temple to Rhea was found in the palace. The temple is located in the Southern section of the palace. This temple was connected with the ekdysia, which is a ritual practiced in Phaistos. The temple was built after the Geometric age.  

== Excavation ==

Phaistos was located in 1853 by Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt, a ship captain who surveyed sites around the Mediterranean. Spratt triangulated the location of Phaistos to a hill then known as Kastri (&quot;fort&quot;, &quot;small castle&quot;) using the locations or Gortyn, Matala, and the coast. A village of 16 houses remained on the ridge, but the vestiges of fortification walls indicated that a city had existed there.

In 1894, Antonio Taramelli excavated pottery at Phaistos at the behest of Federico Halbherr. Seal stones and cylinder seals were also found. From 1900 to 1904 Federico Halbherr and his student Luigi Pernier excavated at Phaistos. Occasional work continued at Phaistos until 1908 while Halbherr and Pernier excavated at the Minoan site of Hagia Triada, located about 3 kilometers away. Between 1909 and 1922 Antonio Minto excavated on the hill of Christos Effendi, especially the fortification walls there.
Between 1950 and 1966 an Italian School of Archaeology at Athens team led by Doro Levi worked at Phaistos. From 2000 to 2004 the effort was led by Vincenzo La Rosa. Beginning in 2007 the Phaistos Project (also Progetto festos), led by Fausto Longo, under the aegis of the Italian Archaeological School of Athens has worked at the site, mainly conducting surveys, restorations, and targeted excavations. To date 61 Linear A inscribed items have been found at Phaistos (26 tablets, 35 sealed documents). Also found were 12 sealed roundels (9 inscribed with Linear A characters) and thousands of sealings (including nodules).

In 1908, the Phaistos Disc was found in a basement room (Room 101), along with a Linear A tablet, on the northern side of the palace in a Middle Minoan IIIb level. The disc was found with assorted pottery that dates to approximately 1800 BCE, which was around when the palace could have been reconstructed. Finding artifacts in Phaistos is difficult because the Minoans thoroughly cleaned the original palace ruins before beginning the later iterations. This left few archaeological remains to be found in the palace.
The tombs of the rulers of Phaistos were found in a cemetery near the palace remains. To the southwest of Phaistos, tholos tombs have been found and cemeteries were found to the northwest. Some items found in tombs at Phaistos have been declared as bronze armor scraps. Originally, tombs were built for communal use but after the 400 BCE, the use of small group and family tombs became common practice. A clay model found at one of the larger tombs depicts couples at altars with offerings. The details of this model have been likened to the Hagia Triada sarcophagus.

Pottery including polychrome items and embossing in imitation of metal work has been found at Phaistos. This imitation came in the form of making pottery extremely thin, being likened to eggshell. This pottery also mimicked the shapes that metal items were made in. Many of the pottery items had fluting or embossments. This metallurgy replication was mostly found in small vases and cups. Minoan pottery quality changed around 1800 BCE, and shiny vibrant colors were replaced by multiple dull colors.

== In literature and myth ==

References to Phaistos in ancient Greek literature are quite infrequent. Phaistos is referenced by Homer, in the Iliad, as &quot;well populated&quot;, and the Homeric epics indicate its participation in the Trojan War. The historian Diodorus Siculus indicates that Phaistos, as well as Knossos and Kydonia, are the three towns founded by King Minos on Crete. However, Pausanias and Stephanus of Byzantium indicate that the founder of the city was Phaestos, son of Hercules or Ropalus. The city of Phaistos is associated with the mythical king of Crete Rhadamanthys.

<doc id="297343" wikidata="Q128999" url="?curid=297343" title="José Luis Bustamante y Rivero">
<text>José Luis Bustamante y Rivero (January 15, 1894 – January 11, 1989) was a lawyer, writer, politician, and diplomat who served as the 44th President of Peru from 1945 to 1948 and President of the International Court of Justice in The Hague from 1967 to 1970.

== Early years ==
José Bustamante was born in Arequipa. His parents were Manuel Bustamante y Barreda, a lawyer and district attorney in Arequipa, and Victoria de Rivero y Romero. José married María Jesús Rivera in 1923. He received his early education in Arequipa at Colegio San José and obtained his law degree from the Universidad Nacional San Agustín de Arequipa in his native city and his Ph.D. from the Universidad Nacional San Antonio Abad in Cusco. After a distinguished career as a professor and legal scholar, Bustamante became interested in politics.

==Coup against Leguía==
Bustamante reached political maturity as the author of the manifesto which launched the 1930 coup that ousted President Augusto B. Leguía. He soon earned the trust of Leguía&#x27;s successor, Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro, and began his new career in 1934 by serving as a diplomat, representing Peru as Peruvian Minister to Bolivia (1934–1938, 1942–1945) and Uruguay (1939–1942).

He ran for president in 1945 as a candidate for the Frente Democrático Nacional, a moderate, left-of-center party that aligned itself with Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre&#x27;s APRA and the Peruvian Communist Party. Opposing him was the Legión Patriótica Independiente candidate, Gen. Eloy G. Ureta. Bustamante comfortably won the election, the cleanest Peru had held in decades.

==Presidency==
During his first seven days as president, Bustamante restored press freedom and full civil rights and freed all political prisoners. He also purged the military, cancelled gambling licenses and took control of the expenditures of the national treasury. One of his important international agreements was to establish that Peruvian sovereignty extended 200 miles out to sea, a doctrine that was widely accepted in international law.

As president, Bustamante hoped to create a more democratic government by limiting the power of the military and the oligarchy. Conflict soon arose, however, between the president and Haya de la Torre. Without the support of the APRA party Bustamante found his presidency severely limited.

The murder of the ultraconservative editor , a prominent member of the Peruvian elite (and bitter editorial enemy of the APRA Party), sparked a political crisis that was blamed immediately on the APRA&#x27;s influence on the Government. President Bustamante y Rivero was forced to name a military cabinet to tide over the crisis.

In October 1948, rebel sailors and officers seized five warships, locked up or shot their commanders, sent landing parties ashore under cover of a ragged bombardment. Shore-based sailors took over the Naval Academy, the Naval Armory, and the Real Felipe Fortress. After troops loyal to the government crushed the revolt, President Bustamante suspended all civil rights.

The insurrection, he declared, had been the work of the APRA Party. Under the President&#x27;s orders, government troops occupied the APRA headquarters, seized the plant of its newspaper, &quot;La Tribuna&quot;, and arrested several prominent Apristas. But for the military cabinet, those moves were not enough. Postwar economic problems and strife caused by strong labor unions led to a military coup on October 29, 1948, which led General Manuel A. Odría to become the new president. Bustamante went into exile on the same day and was taken to Argentina.

== Post-presidency ==

While in exile, Bustamante resided in Buenos Aires, Madrid and Paris. On February 9, 1956, while Odría still in power, Bustamante returned to Peru, causing Peruvians great surprise. In 1960 he was elected a member of the International Court of Justice in The Hague and served as its president from 1967 to 1969.

In 1969, due to his recognition as an international jurist, the Organization of American States designated Bustamante as a mediator in the border conflict between El Salvador and Honduras known as the Football War, which ended peacefully after a peace treaty was signed on October 30, 1980, in Lima, Peru.

As a former president of Peru, Bustamante was ultimately elected senator for life from 1980 to 1989, as established by the Peruvian Constitution of 1979.

He died in Lima in 1989, aged 94, four days before his 95th birthday.

==Published works==
José Bustamante was the author of several judicial and other related works currently in the National Library of Peru. His published works include the following: 
* &quot;Arequipa&quot; (1947)
* &quot;Tres años de lucha por la democracia en el Perú&quot; (1949)
* &quot;Panamericanismo e iberoamericanismo&quot; (1951)
* &quot;Artesanía textil en el Perú&quot; (1952)
* &quot;Mensaje al Perú: Perú, estructura social&quot; (1960)
* &quot;La Corte Internacional de justicia&quot; (1964)
* &quot;Una visión del Perú&quot; (1972)
* &quot;Derecho del mar&quot; (1972)

<doc id="297348" wikidata="Q6058493" url="?curid=297348" title="Intranet strategies">
<text>In business, an intranet strategy is the use of an intranet and associated hardware and software to obtain one or more organizational objectives. An &quot;intranet&quot; is an access-restricted network used internally in an organization. An intranet uses the same concepts and technologies as the World Wide Web and Internet. This includes web browsers and servers running on the internet protocol suite and using Internet protocols such as FTP, TCP/IP, HTML, and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). 

==Role of intranets==

Intranets are generally used for four types of applications:

1) Communication and collaboration
*send and receive e-mail, faxes, voice mail, and paging
*discussion rooms and chat rooms
*audio and video conferencing
*virtual team meetings and project collaboration
*online company discussions as events (e.g., IBM Jams)
*inhouse blogs

2) Web publishing
*develop and publish hyperlinked multi-media documents such as:
**policy manuals
**company newsletters
**product catalogs
**technical drawings
**training material
**telephone directories

3) Business operations and management
*order processing
*inventory control
*production setup and control
*management information systems
*database access

4) Intranet portal management
*centrally administer all network functions including servers, clients, security, directories, and traffic
*give users access to a variety of internal and external business tools/applications
*integrate different technologies
*conduct regular user research to identify and confirm strategy (random sample surveys, usability testing, focus groups, in-depth interviews with wireframes, etc.)

==Why have an intranet strategy?== 
Having a strategy pre-supposes a planned, orderly process with proper costing and budgeting, it involves consulting with the parties who are going to be using the intranet, allows for an efficient integration with existing systems and phasing-out of older ones, has long term benefits when the intranet needs to be scaled or made more secure, maintains control and quality in the hands of the designated department that &quot;owns&quot; it, and creates for the provision of feedback to monitor whether the &quot;investment&quot; is living up to the organization&#x27;s expectations.

==Potential advantages of using intranets==

*reduces printing, distribution, and paper costs - particularly on policy manuals, company newsletters, product catalogs, technical drawings, training material, and telephone directories 
*easy to use - no specialized training required
*inexpensive to use (once it is set up)
*moderate initial setup costs (hardware and software)
*standardized network protocol (TCP/IP), document protocol (HTML), and file transfer protocol (ftp) already well established and suitable for all platforms
*can be used throughout the enterprise
*reduces employee training costs
*reduces sales and marketing costs
*reduces office administration and accounting costs
*ease of access results in a more integrated company with employees communicating and collaborating more freely and more productively

==Potential disadvantages of intranets==

*it is an evolving technology that requires upgrades and could have software incompatibility problems
*security features can be inadequate
*inadequate system performance management and poor user support
*may not scale up adequately
*maintaining content can be time-consuming
*some employees may not have PCs at their desks
*The aims of the organisation in developing an intranet may not align with user needs (see: further reading)

<text>Catharine Parr Traill (born Strickland; 9 January 1802 – 29 August 1899) was an English-Canadian author and naturalist who wrote about life in Canada, particularly what is now Ontario (then the colony of Upper Canada). In the 1830s, Canada covered an area considerably smaller than today. At the time, most of Upper Canada had not been explored by European settlers.

Throughout her long life, Traill wrote to generate income in support of her family. She wrote 24 books covering topics ranging from her life as a settler in Ontario to natural history, especially botany. Traill is considered a pioneer of Canada&#x27;s natural history. Through her writing, she related the colonial experience and described the natural environment of Upper Canada for English readers.

Traill is considered an amateur botanist, because at the time, it was not possible for women to hold professional, paid positions.

==Early years==

Catharine Parr Strickland was born in the district of Rotherhithe in Southwark (then in Surrey, today part of Greater London) in 1802, fifth child out of eight, of Thomas Strickland and Elizabeth Homer. Catharine had four older sisters - Elizabeth, Agnes, Sarah and Jane Margaret - and a younger sister, Susanna, as well as two younger brothers, Samuel and Thomas.

Traill&#x27;s father retired from his position as manager of the Greenland Docks on the River Thames and moved the family to the countryside in Suffolk, shortly after her birth. She grew up in East Anglia, first near Bungay, and later Southwold and was educated at home. After Thomas Strickland died in 1818, Catharine and her sisters turned to writing and editorial work as the main source of family income.

==Career==
Sister to fellow authors Agnes Strickland, Jane Margaret Strickland, Susanna Moodie, and Elisabeth Strickland, Traill was the first of her siblings to commence writing. She began writing children&#x27;s books in 1818 after the death of her father. Traill&#x27;s first book &quot;The tell tale&quot;: &quot;an original collection of moral and amusing stories&quot; appeared anonymously in 1818; she was only 16. Her early works, such as &quot;Disobedience, or Mind What Mama Says&quot; (1819) and &quot;Happy Because Good&quot;, were written for children, and often dwell on the benefits of obedience to one&#x27;s parents. A prolific author, until her marriage she averaged one book per year. In 1832, she married Lieutenant Thomas Traill, a retired officer of the Napoleonic Wars and a friend of her sister&#x27;s husband, John Moodie, despite objections from her family (aside from Susanna). Soon after their marriage, they left for Upper Canada, settling near Peterborough, where her brother Samuel was a surveyor. Her sister, Mrs. Susanna Moodie, emigrated soon afterwards.

Traill described her new life in letters and journals and collected these into &quot;The Backwoods of Canada&quot; (1836), which continues to be read as an important source of information about early Canada. She describes everyday life in the community, the relationship between Canadians, Americans, and Indigenous peoples, the climate, and local flora and fauna. 

Traill included further observations in a novel, &quot;Canadian Crusoes&quot; (1851). She also collected information about the skills necessary for a new settler, published in &quot;The Female Emigrant&#x27;s Guide&quot; (1854), later retitled &quot;The Canadian Settler&#x27;s Guide&quot;. She wrote &quot;Pearls and Pebbles&quot; and &quot;Cot and Cradle Stories&quot;.

After the depression of 1836, Traill&#x27;s husband Thomas joined the militia in 1837 to fight against the Upper Canada Rebellion. In 1840, dissatisfied with life in &quot;the backwoods,&quot; both the Traills and the Moodies moved to the city of Belleville, Ontario. While Susanna was more concerned with the differences between rural and urban life, Catharine spent her years in Belleville writing about the natural environment. She often sketched the plant life of Upper Canada, publishing &quot;Canadian Wild Flowers&quot; (1868), &quot;Studies of Plant Life in Canada&quot; (1885) and &quot;Rambles in the Canadian Forest&quot;.

She received a grant c. 1899 from the Royal Bounty Fund, which was supplemented by a subscription from her friends in Canada, headed by Sir Sandford Fleming. She died at her residence, &quot;Westove,&quot; in Lakefield, Ontario on 28 August 1899.

Her many albums of plant collections are housed in the National Herbarium of Canada at the Canadian Museum of Nature.

===Recognition===
Trent University, in Peterborough, Ontario, named their downtown campus after her. Catharine Parr Traill College is the university&#x27;s main college for graduate studies.

===Commemorative postage stamp===
On 8 September 2003, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the National Library of Canada, Canada Post released a special commemorative series, &quot;The Writers of Canada&quot;, designed by Katalina Kovats and featuring two English-Canadian and two French-Canadian stamps. Three million stamps were issued. Traill and her sister Susanna Moodie were featured on one of the English-Canadian stamps.

<text>Pharmacy is the science and practice of discovering, producing, preparing, dispensing, reviewing and monitoring medications, aiming to ensure the safe, effective, and affordable use of medicines. It is a miscellaneous science as it links health sciences with pharmaceutical sciences and natural sciences. The professional practice is becoming more clinically oriented as most of the drugs are now manufactured by pharmaceutical industries. Based on the setting, pharmacy practice is either classified as community or institutional pharmacy. Providing direct patient care in the community of institutional pharmacies is considered clinical pharmacy.

The scope of pharmacy practice includes more traditional roles such as compounding and dispensing of medications. It also includes more modern services related to health care including clinical services, reviewing medications for safety and efficacy, and providing drug information with patient counselling. Pharmacists, therefore, are experts on drug therapy and are the primary health professionals who optimize the use of medication for the benefit of the patients.

An establishment in which pharmacy (in the first sense) is practiced is called a &quot;pharmacy&quot; (this term is more common in the United States) or &quot;chemists&quot; (which is more common in Great Britain, though &quot;pharmacy&quot; is also used). In the United States and Canada, &quot;drugstores&quot; commonly sell medicines, as well as miscellaneous items such as confectionery, cosmetics, office supplies, toys, hair care products and magazines, and occasionally refreshments and groceries.

In its investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients, the work of the apothecary may be regarded as a precursor of the modern sciences of chemistry and pharmacology, prior to the formulation of the scientific method.

==Disciplines==

The field of pharmacy can generally be divided into various disciplines:
*Pharmaceutics and Computational Pharmaceutics
*Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
*Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy
*Pharmacology
*Pharmacy Practice
*Pharmacoinformatics
*Pharmacogenomics

The boundaries between these disciplines and with other sciences, such as biochemistry, are not always clear-cut.
Often, collaborative teams from various disciplines (pharmacists and other scientists) work together toward the introduction of new therapeutics and methods for patient care. However, pharmacy is not a basic or biomedical science in its typical form. Medicinal chemistry is also a distinct branch of synthetic chemistry combining pharmacology, organic chemistry, and chemical biology.

Pharmacology is sometimes considered the fourth discipline of pharmacy. Although pharmacology is essential to the study of pharmacy, it is not specific to pharmacy. Both disciplines are distinct. Those who wish to practice both pharmacy (patient-oriented) and pharmacology (a biomedical science requiring the scientific method) receive separate training and degrees unique to either discipline.

Pharmacoinformatics is considered another new discipline, for systematic drug discovery and development with efficiency and safety.

Pharmacogenomics is the study of genetic-linked variants that effect patient clinical responses, allergies, and metabolism of drugs.

==Professionals==
The World Health Organization estimates that there are at least 2.6 million pharmacists and other pharmaceutical personnel worldwide.

===Pharmacists===

Pharmacists are healthcare professionals with specialized education and training who perform various roles to ensure optimal health outcomes for their patients through the quality use of medicines. Pharmacists may also be small business proprietors, owning the pharmacy in which they practice. Since pharmacists know about the mode of action of a particular drug, and its metabolism and physiological effects on the human body in great detail, they play an important role in optimization of drug treatment for an individual.

Pharmacists are represented internationally by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), an NGO linked with World Health Organization (WHO). They are represented at the national level by professional organisations such as the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in the UK, Pharmaceutical Society of Australia (PSA), Canadian Pharmacists Association (CPhA), Indian Pharmacist Association (IPA), Pakistan Pharmacists Association (PPA), American Pharmacists Association (APhA), and the Malaysian Pharmaceutical Society (MPS).

In some cases, the representative body is also the registering body, which is responsible for the regulation and ethics of the profession.

In the United States, specializations in pharmacy practice recognized by the Board of Pharmacy Specialties include: cardiovascular, infectious disease, oncology, pharmacotherapy, nuclear, nutrition, and psychiatry. The Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy certifies pharmacists in geriatric pharmacy practice. The American Board of Applied Toxicology certifies pharmacists and other medical professionals in applied toxicology.

==Pharmacy support staff==
===Pharmacy technicians===
Pharmacy technicians support the work of pharmacists and other health professionals by performing a variety of pharmacy-related functions, including dispensing prescription drugs and other medical devices to patients and instructing on their use. They may also perform administrative duties in pharmaceutical practice, such as reviewing prescription requests with medic&#x27;s offices and insurance companies to ensure correct medications are provided and payment is received.

Legislation requires the supervision of certain pharmacy technician&#x27;s activities by a pharmacist. The majority of pharmacy technicians work in community pharmacies. In hospital pharmacies, pharmacy technicians may be managed by other senior pharmacy technicians. In the UK the role of a PhT in hospital pharmacy has grown and responsibility has been passed on to them to manage the pharmacy department and specialized areas in pharmacy practice allowing pharmacists the time to specialize in their expert field as medication consultants spending more time working with patients and in research. Pharmacy technicians are registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC). The GPhC is the regulator of pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and pharmacy premises.

In the US, pharmacy technicians perform their duties under the supervision of pharmacists. Although they may perform, under supervision, most dispensing, compounding and other tasks, they are not generally allowed to perform the role of counseling patients on the proper use of their medications. Some states have a legally mandated pharmacist-to-pharmacy technician ratio.

===Dispensing assistants===
Dispensing assistants are commonly referred to as &quot;dispensers&quot; and in community pharmacies perform largely the same tasks as a pharmacy technician. They work under the supervision of pharmacists and are involved in preparing (dispensing and labelling) medicines for provision to patients.

===Healthcare assistants/medicines counter assistants===
In the UK, this group of staff can sell certain medicines (including pharmacy only and general sales list medicines) over the counter. They cannot prepare prescription-only medicines for supply to patients.

== History ==


The earliest known compilation of medicinal substances was the &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot;, an Indian Ayurvedic treatise attributed to Sushruta in the 6th century BC. However, the earliest text as preserved dates to the 3rd or 4th century AD.

Many Sumerian (4th millennium BC – early 2nd millennium BC) cuneiform clay tablets record prescriptions for medicine.

Ancient Egyptian pharmacological knowledge was recorded in various papyri such as the &quot;Ebers Papyrus&quot; of 1550 BC, and the &quot;Edwin Smith Papyrus&quot; of the 16th century BC.
In Ancient Greece, Diocles of Carystus (4th century BC) was one of several men studying the medicinal properties of plants. He wrote several treatises on the topic. The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides is famous for writing a five-volume book in his native Greek Περί ύλης ιατρικής in the 1st century AD. The Latin translation (&quot;Concerning medical substances&quot;) was used as a basis for many medieval texts and was built upon by many middle eastern scientists during the Islamic Golden Age, themselves deriving their knowledge from earlier Greek Byzantine medicine.

Pharmacy in China dates at least to the earliest known Chinese manual, the &quot;Shennong Bencao Jing&quot; (&quot;The Divine Farmer&#x27;s Herb-Root Classic&quot;), dating back to the 1st century AD. It was compiled during the Han dynasty and was attributed to the mythical Shennong. Earlier literature included lists of prescriptions for specific ailments, exemplified by a manuscript &quot;Recipes for 52 Ailments&quot;, found in the Mawangdui, sealed in 168 BC.

In Japan, at the end of the Asuka period (538–710) and the early Nara period (710–794), the men who fulfilled roles similar to those of modern pharmacists were highly respected. The place of pharmacists in society was expressly defined in the Taihō Code (701) and re-stated in the Yōrō Code (718). Ranked positions in the pre-Heian Imperial court were established; and this organizational structure remained largely intact until the Meiji Restoration (1868). In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists—and even pharmacist assistants—were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists. In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor.

There is a stone sign for a pharmacy shop with a tripod, a mortar, and a pestle opposite one for a doctor in the Arcadian Way in Ephesus near Kusadasi in Turkey. The current Ephesus dates back to 400 BC and was the site of the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the world.

In Baghdad the first pharmacies, or drug stores, were established in 754, under the Abbasid Caliphate during the Islamic Golden Age. By the 9th century, these pharmacies were state-regulated.

The advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) (865–915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His &quot;Liber servitoris&quot; is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the &quot;simples&quot; from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to record his findings in a pharmacopoeia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973–1050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled &quot;Kitab al-Saydalah&quot; (&quot;The Book of Drugs&quot;), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as &quot;De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus&quot; by &#x27;Mesue&#x27; the younger, and the &quot;Medicamentis simplicibus&quot; by &#x27;Abenguefit&#x27;. Peter of Abano (1250–1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title &quot;De Veneris&quot;. Al-Muwaffaq&#x27;s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote &quot;The foundations of the true properties of Remedies&quot;, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.

In Europe, pharmacy-like shops began to appear during the 12th century. In 1240, emperor Frederic II issued a decree by which the physician&#x27;s and the apothecary&#x27;s professions were separated.

There are pharmacies in Europe that have been in operation since medieval times. In Florence, Italy, the director of the museum in the former Santa Maria Novella pharmacy says that the pharmacy there dates back to 1221. In Trier (Germany), the Löwen-Apotheke is in operation since 1241, the oldest pharmacy in Europe in continuous operation. In Dubrovnik (Croatia), a pharmacy that first opened in 1317 is located inside the Franciscan monastery: it is the 2nd oldest pharmacy in Europe that is still operating. In the Town Hall Square of Tallinn (Estonia), there is a pharmacy dating from at least 1422. The medieval Esteve Pharmacy, located in Llívia, a Catalan enclave close to Puigcerdà, is a museum: the building dates back to the 15th century and the museum keeps albarellos from the 16th and 17th centuries, old prescription books and antique drugs.

==Practice areas==
Pharmacists practice in a variety of areas including community pharmacies, infusion pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, insurance companies, medical communication companies, research facilities, pharmaceutical companies, extended care facilities, psychiatric hospitals, and regulatory agencies. Pharmacists themselves may have expertise in a medical specialty.

===Community pharmacy===

A &quot;pharmacy&quot; (also known as a &quot;chemist&quot; in Australia, New Zealand and the British Isles; or &quot;drugstore&quot; in North America; &quot;retail pharmacy&quot; in industry terminology; or apothecary, historically) is where most pharmacists practice the profession of pharmacy. It is the community pharmacy in which the dichotomy of the profession exists; health professionals who are also retailers.

Community pharmacies usually consist of a retail storefront with a dispensary, where medications are stored and dispensed. According to Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, the opening of the first drugstores are recorded by Muslim pharmacists in Baghdad in 754 AD.

===Hospital pharmacy===

Pharmacies within hospitals differ considerably from community pharmacies. Some pharmacists in hospital pharmacies may have more complex clinical medication management issues, and pharmacists in community pharmacies often have more complex business and customer relations issues.

Because of the complexity of medications including specific indications, effectiveness of treatment regimens, safety of medications (i.e., drug interactions) and patient compliance issues (in the hospital and at home), many pharmacists practicing in hospitals gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency, sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area. Those pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists and they often specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy.

For example, there are pharmacists who specialize in hematology/oncology, HIV/AIDS, infectious disease, critical care, emergency medicine, toxicology, nuclear pharmacy, pain management, psychiatry, anti-coagulation clinics, herbal medicine, neurology/epilepsy management, pediatrics, neonatal pharmacists and more.

Hospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital. Hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications, including more specialized medications, than would be feasible in the community setting. Most hospital medications are unit-dose, or a single dose of medicine. Hospital pharmacists and trained pharmacy technicians compound sterile products for patients including total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and other medications are given intravenously. That is a complex process that requires adequate training of personnel, quality assurance of products, and adequate facilities.

Several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high-risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding. The high cost of medications and drug-related technology and the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety require hospital pharmacies to perform at the highest level possible.

===Clinical pharmacy===

Pharmacists provide direct patient care services that optimize the use of medication and promotes health, wellness, and disease prevention. Clinical pharmacists care for patients in all health care settings, but the clinical pharmacy movement initially began inside hospitals and clinics. Clinical pharmacists often collaborate with physicians and other healthcare professionals to improve pharmaceutical care. Clinical pharmacists are now an integral part of the interdisciplinary approach to patient care. They often participate in patient care rounds for drug product selection. In the UK clinical pharmacists can also prescribe some medications for patients on the NHS or privately, after completing a non-medical prescribers course to become an Independent Prescriber.

The clinical pharmacist&#x27;s role involves creating a comprehensive drug therapy plan for patient-specific problems, identifying goals of therapy, and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient. The review process often involves an evaluation of the appropriateness of drug therapy (e.g., drug choice, dose, route, frequency, and duration of therapy) and its efficacy. Research shows that pharmacist led strategies reduce errors related to medication use. The pharmacist must also consider potential drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and patient drug allergies while they design and initiate a drug therapy plan.

===Ambulatory care pharmacy===
Since the emergence of modern clinical pharmacy, ambulatory care pharmacy practice has emerged as a unique pharmacy practice setting. Ambulatory care pharmacy is based primarily on pharmacotherapy services that a pharmacist provides in a clinic. Pharmacists in this setting often do not dispense drugs, but rather see patients in-office visits to manage chronic disease states.

In the U.S. federal health care system (including the VA, the Indian Health Service, and NIH) ambulatory care pharmacists are given full independent prescribing authority. In some states, such as North Carolina and New Mexico, these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority. In 2011 the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification. The official designation for pharmacists who pass the ambulatory care pharmacy specialty certification exam will be Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist and these pharmacists will carry the initials BCACP.

===Compounding pharmacy/industrial pharmacy===

Compounding involves preparing drugs in forms that are different from the generic prescription standard. This may include altering the strength, ingredients, or dosage form. Compounding is a way to create custom drugs for patients who may not be able to take the medication in its standard form, such as due to an allergy or difficulty swallowing. Compounding is necessary for these patients to still be able to properly get the prescriptions they need.

One area of compounding is preparing drugs in new dosage forms. For example, if a drug manufacturer only provides a drug as a tablet, a compounding pharmacist might make a medicated lollipop that contains the drug. Patients who have difficulty swallowing the tablet may prefer to suck the medicated lollipop instead.

Another form of compounding is by mixing different strengths (g, mg, mcg) of capsules or tablets to yield the desired amount of medication indicated by the physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical pharmacist practitioner. This form of compounding is found at community or hospital pharmacies or in-home administration therapy.

Compounding pharmacies specialize in compounding, although many also dispense the same non-compounded drugs that patients can obtain from community pharmacies.

===Consultant pharmacy===
Consultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review (i.e. &quot;cognitive services&quot;) than on actual dispensing of drugs. Consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes, but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings. Traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners, though in the United States many now work for a large pharmacy management company such as Omnicare, Kindred Healthcare or PharMerica. This trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients, primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings. Some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services.

The main principle of consultant pharmacy is developed by Hepler and Strand in 1990.

===Veterinary pharmacy===

Veterinary pharmacies, sometimes called &quot;animal pharmacies&quot;, may fall in the category of hospital pharmacy, retail pharmacy or mail-order pharmacy. Veterinary pharmacies stock different varieties and different strengths of medications to fulfill the pharmaceutical needs of animals. Because the needs of animals, as well as the regulations on veterinary medicine, are often very different from those related to people, in some jurisdictions veterinary pharmacy may be kept separate from regular pharmacies.

===Nuclear pharmacy===

Nuclear pharmacy focuses on preparing radioactive materials for diagnostic tests and for treating certain diseases. Nuclear pharmacists undergo additional training specific to handling radioactive materials, and unlike in community and hospital pharmacies, nuclear pharmacists typically do not interact directly with patients.

===Military pharmacy===
Military pharmacy is a different working environment to civilian practise because military pharmacy technicians perform duties such as evaluating medication orders, preparing medication orders, and dispensing medications. This would be illegal in civilian pharmacies because these duties are required to be performed by a licensed registered pharmacist. In the US military, state laws that prevent technicians from counseling patients or doing the final medication check prior to dispensing to patients (rather than a pharmacist solely responsible for these duties) do not apply.

===Pharmacy informatics===

Pharmacy informatics is the combination of pharmacy practice science and applied information science. Pharmacy informaticists work in many practice areas of pharmacy, however, they may also work in information technology departments or for healthcare information technology vendor companies. As a practice area and specialist domain, pharmacy informatics is growing quickly to meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals. Pharmacists in this area are trained to participate in medication management system development, deployment, and optimization.

===Specialty pharmacy===

Specialty pharmacies supply high-cost injectable, oral, infused, or inhaled medications that are used for chronic and complex disease states such as cancer, hepatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike a traditional community pharmacy where prescriptions for any common medication can be brought in and filled, specialty pharmacies carry novel medications that need to be properly stored, administered, carefully monitored, and clinically managed. In addition to supplying these drugs, specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring, adherence counseling, and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs. In the US, it is currently the fastest-growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry with 19 of 28 newly FDA approved medications in 2013 being specialty drugs.

Due to the demand for clinicians who can properly manage these specific patient populations, the Specialty Pharmacy Certification Board has developed a new certification exam to certify specialty pharmacists. Along with the 100 questions computerized multiple-choice exam, pharmacists must also complete 3,000 hours of specialty pharmacy practice within the past three years as well as 30 hours of specialty pharmacist continuing education within the past two years.

==Pharmaceutical sciences==

The pharmaceutical sciences are a group of interdisciplinary areas of study concerned with the design, manufacturing, action, delivery, and classification of drugs. They apply knowledge from chemistry (inorganic, physical, biochemical and analytical), biology (anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, cell biology, and molecular biology), epidemiology, statistics, chemometrics, mathematics, physics, and chemical engineering.

The pharmaceutical sciences are further subdivided into several specific specialties, with four main branches:

*Pharmacology: the study of the biochemical and physiological effects of drugs on human beings.
**Pharmacodynamics: the study of the cellular and molecular interactions of drugs with their receptors. Simply &quot;What the drug does to the body&quot;
**Pharmacokinetics: the study of the factors that control the concentration of drug at various sites in the body. Simply &quot;What the body does to the drug&quot;
**Pharmaceutical toxicology: the study of the harmful or toxic effects of drugs. 
**Pharmacogenomics: the study of the inheritance of characteristic patterns of interaction between drugs and organisms.
*Pharmaceutical chemistry: the study of drug design to optimize pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and synthesis of new drug molecules (Medicinal Chemistry). 
*Pharmaceutics: the study and design of drug formulation for optimum delivery, stability, pharmacokinetics, and patient acceptance.
*Pharmacognosy: the study of medicines derived from natural sources.

As new discoveries advance and extend the pharmaceutical sciences, subspecialties continue to be added to this list. Importantly, as knowledge advances, boundaries between these specialty areas of pharmaceutical sciences are beginning to blur. Many fundamental concepts are common to all pharmaceutical sciences. These shared fundamental concepts further the understanding of their applicability to all aspects of pharmaceutical research and drug therapy.

Pharmacocybernetics (also known as pharma-cybernetics, cybernetic pharmacy, and cyber pharmacy) is an emerging field that describes the science of supporting drugs and medications use through the application and evaluation of informatics and internet technologies, so as to improve the pharmaceutical care of patients.

==Society and culture==

===Etymology===
The word &quot;pharmacy&quot; is derived from Old French &quot;farmacie&quot; &quot;substance, such as a food or in the form of a medicine which has a laxative effect&quot; from Medieval Latin &quot;pharmacia&quot; from Greek &quot;pharmakeia&quot; () &quot;a medicine&quot;, which itself derives from &quot;pharmakon&quot; (), meaning &quot;drug, poison, spell&quot; (which is etymologically related to &quot;pharmakos&quot;).

===Separation of prescribing and dispensing===

Separation of prescribing and dispensing, also called dispensing separation, is a practice in medicine and pharmacy in which the physician who provides a medical prescription is independent from the pharmacist who provides the prescription drug.

In the Western world there are centuries of tradition for separating pharmacists from physicians. In Asian countries, it is traditional for physicians to also provide drugs.

In contemporary time researchers and health policy analysts have more deeply considered these traditions and their effects. Advocates for separation and advocates for combining make similar claims for each of their conflicting perspectives, saying that separating or combining reduces conflict of interest in the healthcare industry, unnecessary health care, and lowers costs, while the opposite causes those things. Research in various places reports mixed outcomes in different circumstances.

===Environmental impacts ===
In 2022 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development proposed that pharmaceutical companies should be required to collect and destroy unused or expired medicines that they have put on the market in order to reduce public health risks around the misuse of medicines obtained from waste bins, the development of antimicrobial resistant bacteria from the discharge of antibiotics into environmental systems and &quot;economic losses&quot; from wasted healthcare resources. Potentially harmful concentrations of pharmaceutical waste has been detected in more than a quarter of water samples taken from 258 rivers around the world. OECD recommend that medicines should be collected separately from household waste and that &quot;marketplaces and redistribution platforms for unused close-to-expiry-date medicines&quot; should be set up. Such extended producer responsibility schemes are already running in France, Spain and Portugal.

===The future of pharmacy===

In the coming decades, pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system. Rather than simply dispensing medication, pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills. In particular, Medication Therapy Management (MTM) includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients. Such services include a thorough analysis of all medication (prescription, non-prescription, and herbals) currently being taken by an individual. The result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system.

This shift has already commenced in some countries; for instance, pharmacists in Australia receive remuneration from the Australian Government for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews. In Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of pharmacy education. They are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews. In Scotland, the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications, for the majority of drugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable. In the United States, pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy. Moreover, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm. D.) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one or two years of residency or fellowship training following graduation. In addition, consultant pharmacists, who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes, are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of &quot;senior care pharmacy&quot;.

In addition to patient care, pharmacies will be a focal point for medical adherence initiatives. There is enough evidence to show that integrated pharmacy based initiatives significantly impact adherence for chronic patients. For example, a study published in NIH shows &quot;pharmacy based interventions improved patients&#x27; medication adherence rates by 2.1 percent and increased physicians&#x27; initiation rates by 38 percent, compared to the control group&quot;.

==Symbols==
The symbols most commonly associated with pharmacy are the mortar and pestle (North America) and the (medical prescription) character, which is often written as &quot;Rx&quot; in typed text; the green Greek cross in France, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and India; the Bowl of Hygieia (only) often used in the Netherlands but may be seen combined with other symbols elsewhere. Other common symbols include conical measures, and (in the US) caduceuses, in their logos. A red stylized letter A in used Germany and Austria (from &quot;Apotheke&quot;, the German word for pharmacy, from the same Greek root as the English word &quot;apothecary&quot;). The show globe was used in the US until the early 20th century; the Gaper in the Netherlands is increasingly rare.

<text>The modern Chinese tunic suit is a style of male attire originally known in China as the Zhongshan suit () after the republican leader Sun Yat-sen (Sun Zhongshan). Sun Yat-sen introduced the style shortly after the founding of the Republic of China (1912–1949) as a form of national dress with distinct political overtones. The four pockets are said to represent the Four Virtues of propriety, justice, honesty, and shame; and the five buttons the branches of China&#x27;s former government (Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination, Control).

After the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, such suits came to be worn widely by male citizens and government leaders as a symbol of proletarian unity and an Eastern counterpart to the Western business suit. The name &quot;Mao suit&quot; comes from Chinese Communist Mao Zedong&#x27;s fondness for the style. The garment became closely associated with him and with Chinese Communism. Mao&#x27;s cut of the suit was influenced by the Stalin tunic then prevalent among Soviet officials. Although it declined in use among the general public in the 1980s and 1990s due to the increasing prominence of the business suit, it is still commonly worn by Chinese leaders during important state ceremonies and functions. The Mao suit was also worn in North Korea by party elites.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Mao suit became fashionable among Western European, Australian, and New Zealander socialists and intellectuals. It was sometimes worn over a turtleneck.

== Origins ==
When the Republic was founded in 1912, the style of dress worn in China was based on Manchu dress (&quot;qipao&quot; and &quot;changshan&quot;), which had been imposed by the Qing Dynasty as a form of social control. The majority-Han Chinese revolutionaries who overthrew the Qing were fueled by the failure of the Qing to defend China and a lack of scientific advancement compared to foreign colonial powers. Even before the founding of the Republic, older forms of Chinese dress were becoming unpopular among the elite and led to the development of Chinese dress which combined the changshan and the European hat to form a new dress. The Zhongshan suit is a parallel development that combined European-inspired Chinese fashion.

==Historical development==

The Mao suit remained the standard formal dress for the first and second generations of PRC leaders such as Deng Xiaoping. During the 1990s, it began to be worn with decreasing frequency by leaders of CCP General Secretary Jiang Zemin&#x27;s generation as more and more Chinese politicians began wearing traditional European-style suits with neckties. Jiang wore it only on special occasions, such as state dinners. General Secretary Hu Jintao still wore the Mao suit on special occasions, such as the ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic in 2009. Hu Jintao appeared at a black tie state dinner in the United States wearing a business suit, attracting some criticism for being underdressed at a formal occasion. In the Xi Jinping Administration the Mao suit made a comeback as a diplomatic uniform and evening dress.

==Symbol of national sovereignty==
The Mao suit is worn at the most formal ceremonies as a symbol of national sovereignty. China&#x27;s paramount leaders always wear Mao suits for military parades in Beijing, even though other Politburo Standing Committee members and other Politburo officials wear European business suits. It is customary for Chinese leaders to wear Mao suits when attending state dinners. In this situation, the Mao suit serves as a form of evening dress, equivalent to a military uniform for a monarch, or a tuxedo for a paramount leader.

The Mao suit also serves as a diplomatic uniform. Although Chinese ambassadors usually wear European business suits, many Chinese ambassadors choose to wear a Mao suit when they present their credentials to the head of state. The presentation ceremony is symbolic of the diplomatic recognition that exists between the two countries, so it carries a higher level of formality than other diplomatic meetings.

<text>The Desventuradas Islands (, , &quot;Unfortunate Islands&quot; or &quot;Islas de los Desventurados&quot;, &quot;Islands of the Unfortunate Ones&quot;) is a group of four small oceanic islands located off the coast of Chile, northwest of Santiago in the Pacific Ocean. They are considered part of Insular Chile.

Due to their isolation and difficulty of access there are no civilian settlements on these islands, but a detachment of the Chilean Navy is stationed on Isla San Félix, which also hosts the Isla San Felix Airport.

==History==
===Prehistory===
No signs of prehistoric human activity by Polynesians or Indigenous peoples of the Americas have ever been found on the islands, or on the neighboring Juan Fernández Islands. Michael Levinson&#x27;s 1973 book &quot;The Settlement of Polynesia&quot; states, &quot;the Juan Fernández Islands and San Felix and San Ambrosio were apparently unoccupied in pre-Columbian times and were not discovered by the Spanish until between 1563 and 1574. There is no evidence available to suggest that they were visited for fishing or other reasons by Amerindians before this.&quot;

===Discovery===
The islands were possibly discovered by Ferdinand Magellan as early as 1521. The first confirmed sighting was by Juan Fernández on 6 November 1574 while voyaging from Callao to Valparaíso. Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa wrote in 1579 that &quot;they are now called after St. Felix and St. Ambor (i.e. Felix and Nabor)&quot;. However, the name of the martyr Ambor (Nabor) became confused with that of the more famous bishop Saint Ambrose (San Ambrosio).
It is, probably, one of these islands that Captain John Davis struck one night in 1686. He was able to continue his voyage but erroneously reported the position of the incident.

San Felix played a part in the Falklands War. In May 1982, the Chilean government allowed an RAF Nimrod R1 to fly signals reconnaissance sorties from the island, gathering information on Argentine Air Force movements.

==Ecology==

Vegetation of the larger islands is a miniature mosaic of matorral, barren rock, various sizes of trees, and shrubs mixed with ferns and perennial herbs. &quot;Sonchus laceratus&quot; is an endemic shrub species. The large islands, San Félix and San Ambrosio, are home to a critical WWF recognized temperate forest biome.

The marine fauna shares close affinities with the south Pacific and the central Pacific, more so than with the nearing South America. This is partly due to the Humboldt Current, which helps create a powerful biogeographic barrier between these islands and South America.

There are no permanent sources of fresh water on any of the islands. Vertebrates inhabiting both of the largest islands are limited to birds. Ten species of marine birds and one land bird species, some of them endangered, make their nests on or visit the islands. The island group has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it is a breeding site for large numbers of Masatierra petrels.

<doc id="297354" wikidata="Q367557" url="?curid=297354" title="Thorvald Stauning">
<text>Thorvald August Marinus Stauning (; 26 October 1873 in Copenhagen – 3 May 1942) was the first social democratic prime minister of Denmark. He served as Prime Minister from 1924 to 1926 and again from 1929 until his death in 1942.

Under Stauning&#x27;s leadership, Denmark, like other Western European countries, developed a social welfare state, and though many of his ambitions for Social Democracy were ultimately thwarted in his lifetime by events beyond his control, his leadership through grave times places Stauning among the most admired of twentieth-century Danish statesmen.

The Stauning Alps, a large mountain range in Greenland, were named after him.

==Political career==
===Member of the Folketing===
Stauning was trained as a cigar sorter and soon became involved with trade union activity. From 1896 to 1908 he was leader of the Cigar Sorters&#x27; Union (part of the Danish Tobacco Workers&#x27; Union, in 1898 – 1904 also editor of the magazine &quot;Samarbejdet&quot; (Co-operation) of the Federation of Trade Unions, and elected Member of Parliament &quot;(Folketinget)&quot; in 1906. In 1910 he was elected chairman of the Social Democratic Party (Socialdemokratiet), a position he retained for almost thirty years, until 1939. He participated as Minister without Portfolio in the Cabinet of Zahle II from 1916 to 1920.

===Prime Minister of Denmark===
He was elected to government as prime minister in 1924 for the minority cabinet Cabinet of Thorvald Stauning I which would survive until 1926. His cabinet was considered ground-breaking not only as it was the first purely Social Democratic cabinet, but also because a woman, Nina Bang, was appointed Minister of Education, which attracted some international attention, as she was one of the first female ministers in the world.

From 1929 he led the successful coalition cabinet Cabinet of Thorvald Stauning II with the social liberal &quot;Det Radikale Venstre&quot; party that would steer Denmark out of the Great Depression, shaping a major political compromise that greatly improved the Danish economy, and also transformed the Social Democratic Party from a class party to a popular party. Under Stauning&#x27;s leadership Denmark, like the other Western European countries, developed a social welfare state. It is often proposed that the long-lived coalition cabinet actively averted the communist and fascist movements that were sweeping much of Europe from developing a strong following in Denmark.

In January 1933, Stauning&#x27;s government entered into what was then the most extensive settlement yet in Danish politics—the Kanslergade settlement ()—with the liberal party Venstre. The settlement, which was named after Stauning&#x27;s apartment in Kanslergade in Copenhagen, included extensive agricultural subsidies and reforms of the legislation and administration in the social sector.
Stauning holds a record in Danish politics, in having successfully sought re-election no less than three times (1932, 1935 (With the famous slogan &quot;Stauning or Chaos&quot;), 1939). However, an attempt to amend the Constitution failed in 1939, as the turnout in the referendum was insufficient to validate the result. This came as a tremendous blow to Stauning, who seemed to lose his previously sure touch for politics thereafter. He reportedly considered resigning in the wake of the referendum failure, but was persuaded to stay on.

=== Occupation Cabinet ===
Stauning&#x27;s second cabinet lasted until Operation Weserübung, the Nazi occupation of Denmark, began on 9 April 1940, when the cabinet was widened to include all political parties, called the Stauning III Cabinet. Contrary to most other governments of the Nazi-invaded countries, King Christian X of Denmark and his government ordered the army and navy to stop fighting, and chose to remain in their country also under the occupation, which is believed to have contributed to the Nazi leaders being more lenient in Denmark than in other countries under Hitler&#x27;s control. During the German occupation of Denmark in World War II, Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning adopted a policy of collaboration with Nazi Germany to protect Danish sovereignty and minimize the impact of the occupation. Stauning believed that cooperating with the German authorities would prevent harsher measures and maintain a semblance of Danish self-governance. His government facilitated economic collaboration, such as supplying agricultural products to Germany, while the Danish police were ordered to cooperate with the occupiers to ensure public order and security. This collaborationist stance was controversial, and Stauning&#x27;s actions were seen by many as a pragmatic approach to an unavoidable situation.
Despite initial intentions to protect Denmark, the Danish government&#x27;s collaboration with the Nazis faced significant criticism. Resistance movements within Denmark viewed its policies as capitulation, leading to increased tensions between the government and underground groups. Over time, Stauning&#x27;s health declined, and he died in 1942, leaving his successors to navigate the complex relationship with the occupying forces. The Danish government&#x27;s collaboration continued under new leadership, but resistance efforts grew stronger, culminating in greater opposition to Nazi policies and significant acts of sabotage.

==Legacy==

Like many other workers&#x27; leaders of his generation, such as Hjalmar Branting in Sweden, Stauning was a charismatic leader who played an important role in integrating Danish society after the social changes following the Industrial Revolution and common suffrage. His campaign slogan, &quot;Stauning or Chaos&quot;, () resonated in a nation undergoing a period of massive unemployment caused by the economic, social and political turmoil of its neighbors and trading partners, notably Denmark&#x27;s chief trading partner Germany. The following Great Depression brought Danish unemployment to unprecedented heights. This period of widespread social malaise was fertile ground for leaders who could communicate a confident and coherent vision to the masses. Stauning was such a man for Denmark, and his popularity won the Social Democratic Party 46% of the total votes in the 1935 Folketing election, a figure never again reached by any Danish party.

He was given a state funeral in 1942, an honour normally not bestowed on Danish prime ministers. He is buried in Copenhagen&#x27;s Vestre Cemetery. Although Denmark&#x27;s relationship with Germany during World War II has been controversial, Stauning&#x27;s legacy in Denmark remains positive. His popularity in the 1930s acted as a force limiting the growth of other populist parties—most importantly, the Nazi party, which remained politically insignificant. Stauning also played a major role in containing the constitutional Easter Crisis of 1920 where he brokered a deal with the king in which the monarch accepted a reduction of his own role to a merely symbolical one, avoiding any future interference in the functioning of parliamentary democracy. In return, Stauning kept the pro-republican elements of the Social Democratic Party in line and ensured his party&#x27;s political support to the continuation of the Danish monarchy. His government was also responsible for laying the foundations to the future Danish welfare state.

His grandson Søren Goldmann Stauning is a local politician in Them.

<text>Maguindanao (; Maguindanaon: &quot;Dairat nu Magindanaw&quot;; Iranun: &quot;Perobinsia a Magindanao&quot;; ) was a province of the Philippines located in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). From 2014 to 2022, its provincial capital was Buluan, but the legislative branch of government, the Maguindanao Provincial Board, convened at the old provincial capitol in Sultan Kudarat. It bordered Lanao del Sur to the north, Cotabato to the east, Sultan Kudarat to the south, and Illana Bay to the west.

It is now used collectively to refer to the provinces of Maguindanao del Sur and Maguindanao del Norte, with which it was replaced with since September 18, 2022 after a division of the province was approved in a plebiscite.

==History==
===Maguindanao Sultanate===
According to Maguindanao royal records, Sharif Muhammad Kabungsuan of Johor introduced Islam to the Maguindanaos at the end of the 15th century. He subsequently married a Maranao princess of Malabang and established the Sultanate of Maguindanao.

The name of the island of Mindanao is from a 16th-century Spanish approximation of the name &quot;Mangindanaw&quot; which is at least a Tagalog exonym if not an endonym of the Maguindanao state and people.

Its capital of Kuta Watu (modern-day Cotabato) formed the sultanate&#x27;s heartland but its influence extended from the Zamboanga Peninsula to Sarangani Bay and Davao.

In the 1660s, Dutch vessels from Ternate and Tidore often stopped by Maguindanao to purchase rice, beeswax and tobacco.

====Spanish attacks====

The Spanish frequently attacked the sultanate starting in the 1600s. In the middle of the 19th century, the Spanish were able to build a military post at what is now Barangay Tamontaka, Cotabato City.

===American rule===
The historical province of Cotabato covered the present area of Maguindanao. In 1903, the American colonial government established the Moro Province and made Cotabato as one of its districts. Upon the conversion of the Moro Province into the Department of Mindanao and Sulu in 1914, the districts were made into provinces.

===World War II===

In 1942, the Japanese forces first attacked what is now Maguindanao.

In 1945, Maguindanao was liberated by allied Philippine Commonwealth troops and Maguindanaon guerrilla units after defeating the Japanese Imperial forces in the Battle of Maguindanao during the Second World War.

===Third Philippine Republic onwards===
====Reinstitution as a province====
The territory of the old province of Cotabato was reduced in 1966 when several of its municipalities were separated from it and constituted into the newly created province of South Cotabato. In 1973, Cotabato was dissolved when it was split to create three new provinces: Maguindanao, (North) Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat.

Maguindanao is the only Muslim-majority province of the four created out of the original Cotabato Province. In 1989, majority of its voters opted to join the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao but Cotabato City did not. Despite this, the city would later serve as the provisional capital of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and host line agency offices for the province.

On August 23, 1992, 16 senior officers of the insurgent Communist Party of the Philippines-New People&#x27;s Army (CPP-NPA) operating in the province were arrested by intelligence operatives of the Philippine National Police, with officials considering it to be a significant hit against the organization&#x27;s progress in the region.

===Shariff Kabunsuan creation and nullification===

On October 31, 2006, Maguindanao voters approved the creation of a new province to be composed of 10 towns from the province. Of more than 500,000 voters registered, 285,372 favored the creation of the province, and 8,802 voted against it. The new province, Shariff Kabunsuan, established through &quot;Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No. 201&quot; by the ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly, became the country&#x27;s 80th province and the 6th in the ARMM. It was composed of the towns of Datu Odin Sinsuat, Kabuntalan, Upi, Sultan Kudarat, Datu Blah T. Sinsuat, Sultan Mastura, Parang, Buldon, Matanog and Barira. However, in July 2008, the Supreme Court, in an 8–6 vote, nullified the province&#x27;s creation, restoring its municipalities to Maguindanao, ruling that &quot;Only Congress can create provinces and cities because the creation of provinces and cities necessarily includes the creation of legislative districts&quot;.

===2009 election violence===
On November 23, 2009, a 2010 gubernatorial election caravan supporting Esmael Mangudadatu, vice mayor of Buluan, was attacked. Fifty-seven people were killed, including Mangudadatu&#x27;s wife and sisters, supporters, local journalists, and bystanders. On December 4, 2009, a number of homes belonging to the Ampatuan political family were raided in connection with the massacre.

President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo officially declared martial law in the province of Maguindanao on December 5, 2009, Saturday morning.

In a press conference past 7 am, Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita announced &quot;Proclamation No. 1959&quot; declaring a state of martial law and suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in the province of Maguindanao, except for certain areas identified as bailiwicks of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) separatists.

The declaration of martial law led to the &quot;arrests without warrants&quot; of other members of the Ampatuan clan who have been linked to the November 23 massacre of 58 civilians.

On August 15, 2011, Mangudadatu and his convoy were ambushed as they were on their way to his birthday celebration.

===Mamasapano clash===

On January 25, 2015, 44 members of the Special Action Force were killed after they killed the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist Zulkifli Abdhir aka Marwan, by allegedly Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters in Mamasapano, Maguindanao.

===2016 El Niño===

In February 2016, Maguindanao experienced the effects of the 2014–16 El Niño, causing destruction on rice and corn fields due to drought. The province declared a state of calamity in response to the damages caused.

===Abolition and division===

In the 17th Congress, then House Deputy Speaker Bai Sandra Sema (barred by law to run for another term in her current district in 2019) introduced a bill on March 2, 2017, seeking to establish a new province called &quot;Maguindanao North&quot;.

Later in the 18th Congress, two new House bills were filed: one by First District Rep. Datu Roonie Sinsuat Sr., Sema&#x27;s successor, seeking the creation of &quot;Western Maguindanao&quot;; another by Second District Rep. Esmael Mangudadatu with same naming proposal as Sema. A substitute bill was later authored by both Maguindanao representatives along with Tarlac Third District Rep. Noel Villanueva, and approved in the final reading in 2020. In the Senate, three bills were also filed seeking for the same division with Sen. Bong Revilla pursuing instead the same naming proposal as Sinsuat. This time, those bills, except one by Revilla, would name the divided provinces as &quot;Northern Maguindanao&quot; and &quot;Southern Maguindanao&quot;.

In the substitute bill in the House, &quot;Northern Maguindanao&quot; will consist the municipalities that became part of Shariff Kabunsuan along with Sultan Sumagka, and its designated provincial capital will be Datu Odin Sinsuat, while the capital of &quot;Southern Maguindanao&quot; will be Buluan. Both proposed provinces will comprise a lone legislative district. Prior to the final version, the municipalities of Datu Anggal Midtimbang (by Sema and Mangudadatu) and South Upi (by Sinsuat) were proposed to became part of &quot;Maguindanao North/Western Maguindanao&quot;; Sultan Kudarat was proposed by Mangudadatu to be the capital of the then-proposed province.

The proposed division was signed by Pres. Rodrigo Duterte on May 27, 2021, as &quot;Republic Act No. 11550&quot;, with new provinces to be named &quot;Maguindanao del Norte&quot; and &quot;Maguindanao del Sur&quot; (named as the mother province of Maguindanao). The original schedule of the plebiscite, to be supervised by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), was in September 2021, ninety days after the effectivity of the law, but was postponed as the COMELEC was preparing for the 2022 general election.

&quot;RA No. 11550&quot; was ratified on September 17, 2022, in a plebiscite, thus dividing Maguindanao. Among the province-wide plebiscites, it was the most participated in terms of number of registered and actual voters, with the voter turnout as the second highest, only behind that of the 1998 plebiscite creating and taking Compostela Valley from Davao del Norte. With that division, the number of provinces in the country has raised to 82.

A transition period would take place which lasted until January 9, 2023.

==Geography==
Maguindanao was situated in the central section of Mindanao, bordered by Lanao del Sur to the north, Cotabato to the east, Sultan Kudarat to the south, and Illana Bay to the west.

===Administrative divisions===
Maguindanao comprised 36 municipalities, further subdivided into 508 barangays. Cotabato City, although geographically grouped with Maguindanao, was administratively independent from the province.

The province was divided into two congressional districts. In October 2006, the first congressional district was split off into a new province, Shariff Kabunsuan. However, the ARMM&#x27;s Act creating the province was nullified by the Supreme Court in July 2008, on the basis that creation of a province is a function of the Philippine legislature. The area since reverted to the province of Maguindanao.



The province saw establishments of new municipalities, especially during the 2000s. Then ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly (RLA) secretary Dick Mali said such establishments would help in &quot;decentralizing functions and resources&quot; and provide the people &quot;more efficient public service and governance from their public officials.&quot; However, Benedicto Bacani of the Institute of Autonomy and Governance in the Notre Dame University said such acts are methods to prevent potential conflicts between political families by having their own local government units where they can have governmental positions.

==Demographics==

The population of Maguindanao in the 2020 census was 1,667,258 people. When Cotabato City was included for geographical purposes, the province&#x27;s population is 1,667,258 people.

The majority (64.5 percent) of the people in Maguindanao were Maguindanaoans. The Iranuns which dominate the northern towns of Parang, Barira, Buldon and Matanog made up the second largest group with 18.4 percent. The Tedurays, which are the Lumads of the southwestern highlands of the province, made up 8.4 percent of the entire population, while Hiligaynons and Cebuanos constituted the remaining significant groups in the province with each making up 3.2 percent of the population.

The main native languages were Maguindanao and Iranun, while Tagalog had emerged as the primary language among younger generations and was the primary medium of education, making it the province&#x27;s lingua franca. Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Chavacano, and, to the lesser extent, Ilocano were also spoken by Ilocano settlers from Northern Luzon, with the Chavacano dialect spoken in Cotabato City being called &quot;Cotabateño&quot; spoke by settlers from Zamboanga City, which evolved from the Zamboangueño dialect and Cebuano as spoken as the lingua franca of most of Mindanao who are settlers from Visayas. Teduray, also native to the province, was spoken in the municipalities of Upi, South Upi, and Datu Blah T. Sinsuat. English, being one of the country&#x27;s official languages, was also spoken, while Arabic was taught in Islamic schools.

===Religion===
Maguindanao inhabitants are predominantly practitioners of Islam which comprises 82.99% of the population, majority of which are followers of Sunni Islam. A minority are Christians (mostly Roman Catholics), who were mostly Cebuanos, Ilonggos and Chavacanos. Roman Catholics of Maguindanao fell under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kidapawan, a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Cotabato. Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) had several locales in Maguindanao.

==Government==
Maguindanao was divided into two congressional districts, which elected members to the House of Representatives. For the brief period that the province of Shariff Kabunsuan existed, Maguindanao became a lone-district province. Since the appointment of a new set of provincial officials for the reunified province of Maguindanao by the ARMM Governor in January 2009, the provincial government reverted to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan district configuration from before Shariff Kabunsuan was created.

Having elected to join the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), Maguindanao also sent six representatives (three per SP district) to the ARMM Regional Legislative Assembly that convened in Cotabato City.

===Provincial capital===

When the province was established in 1973, the designated seat of government was the municipality of Maganoy. The first appointed governor, Simeon Datumanong, held office in Limpongo, a former barangay in Maganoy which is now part of the municipality of Datu Hoffer Ampatuan.

Datumanong&#x27;s successor Zacaria Candao, on the other hand, held office at P.C. Hill, the site of the former headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary in Cotabato City, an autonomous chartered city not under Maguindanao&#x27;s provincial jurisdiction.

In 1977 following the resignation of Candao, President Ferdinand Marcos moved the province&#x27;s seat of government to the municipality of Sultan Kudarat (hometown of the newly appointed governor Sanggacala Baraguir) by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1170. During his term Baraguir held office at the then-newly constructed provincial capitol in that municipality&#x27;s Barangay Simuay Crossing.

The next governor, Sandiale Sambolawan, held office in his hometown of Maganoy following his election to the governorship in 1980. In an attempt to legitimize the restoration of Maganoy&#x27;s status as the seat of provincial government, Batas Pambansa Blg. 211 was enacted in 1982, but with the explicit provision that the change will only take effect after a plebiscite affirms the transfer. A plebiscite was scheduled for December 18, 1982, but was never administered, thus making the municipality of Sultan Kudarat still capital of Maguindanao by law (&quot;de jure&quot;), but Maganoy being the capital in practice (&quot;de facto&quot;). Following the end of the Marcos Regime, the next two governors – Zacaria Candao (1986–1992; 1995–2001) and Norodin Matalam (1992–1995) – both held office in the existing capitol at Sultan Kudarat thereby restoring the municipality&#x27;s status as both &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; provincial capital from 1986 to 2001.

Despite the lack of legal justification in the form of a law amending P.D. No. 1170 of 1977 or the passage of a supporting Sangguaniang Panlalawigan (SP) resolution, the next governor, Andal Ampatuan Sr. (governor from 2001 to 2008), and his successor, son Sajid Ampatuan (2008–2009), held office in the Ampatuan clan stronghold of Shariff Aguak (renamed from Maganoy in 1996), citing security concerns connected to clan rivalry. A new 218-million provincial capitol complex, inaugurated in 2009 in the presence of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, was located adjacent to the homes of the Ampatuans, and sat on a piece of Amaptuan clan land that had not been legally deeded to the government. The Ampatuans were even known to spend more time within the &quot;satellite offices&quot; they set up within their private properties, despite though the new capitol being located adjacent to their homes.

Esmael Mangudadatu, who took office after defeating Andal Ampatuan Jr. in the 2010 gubernatorial election, cited security concerns when he decided to work from a &quot;satellite office,&quot; named the Rajah Buayan Silongan Peace Center, in his hometown of Buluan; this move was supported by Resolution No. 5, series 2010, of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (SP) of Maguindanao. SP Resolution No. 78, dated May 3, 2011, further allowed the transfer of the legislative branch of the provincial government (Sangguniang Panlalawigan) to the rehabilitated old capitol site in Barangay Simuay Crossing, Sultan Kudarat. This effectively made both Buluan and Sultan Kudarat – located 120 kilometers apart by road – the seats of the executive and legislative branches of provincial government respectively.

On April 3, 2012, the SP of Maguindanao issued Resolution No. 132, reiterating that the town of Sultan Kudarat was the capital of Maguindanao. However this was superseded by a new resolution passed in 2014 naming Buluan the new capital of Maguindanao. Buluan&#x27;s Rajah Buayan Silongan Peace Center then served as the provisional capitol building, pending the completion of the executive building in the new capitol complex. However, the legislative branch of provincial government, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Maguindanao, continued to hold sessions in the rehabilitated buildings of the old provincial capitol in Simuay, Sultan Kudarat.

The Ampatuan-built former provincial capitol complex in Shariff Aguak, initially planned to be converted for public school use, was planned to become the new headquarters of the ARMM&#x27;s Bureau of Fire Protection and eventually became an infantry brigade of the Philippine Army. However, incumbent governor Bai Mariam Mangudadatu held her office in the Shariff Aguak Provincial Capitol and planned to convert the Buluan provincial capitol to a district hospital.

Following the provincial division as approved in the 2022 plebiscite, Section 5 of Republic Act No. 11550 officially designated Buluan as the capital of the mother municipality of Maguindanao del Sur where Shariff Aguak is also located. Sultan Kudarat municipality was designated to Maguindanao del Norte but Datu Odin Sinsuat will be designated as its capital.

<doc id="297366" wikidata="Q954869" url="?curid=297366" title="Tunnel rat">
<text>The tunnel rats were American, Australian, New Zealand, and South Vietnamese soldiers who performed underground search and destroy missions during the Vietnam War.

Later, similar teams were used by the Soviet Army during the Soviet–Afghan War and by the Israel Defense Forces in campaigns in the Middle East.

==In the Vietnam War==
During the Vietnam War, &quot;tunnel rat&quot; became an unofficial specialty for volunteer combat engineers and infantrymen from the Australian Army and the U.S. Army who cleared and destroyed enemy tunnel complexes. Their motto was the tongue-in-cheek Latin phrase &quot;Non Gratum Anus Rodentum&quot; (&quot;not worth a rat&#x27;s ass&quot;).

In the early stages of the war against the French colonial forces, the Viet Minh created an extensive underground system of tunnels, which was later expanded and improved by the Viet Cong. By the 1960s, the tunnel complexes included hospitals, training areas, storage facilities, headquarters, and barracks. These diverse facilities, coupled with sophisticated ventilation systems, allowed VC guerrillas to remain hidden underground for months at a time.

During the Vietnam War, ANZUS troops uncovered a great number of enemy tunnels while patrolling or conducting larger operations. The men of the 3 Field Troop, an Australian combat engineering unit that served in Vietnam from 1965 to 1966, have made a convincing argument that they were the first allied troops to enter the tunnels. Tunnel rats were given the task of destroying them, gathering intelligence within them, and killing or capturing their occupants—often in conditions of close combat. Typically, a tunnel rat was equipped with only a standard issue M1911 pistol or M1917 revolver, a bayonet, a flashlight, and explosives.

Many tunnel rats reportedly came to dislike the intense muzzle blast of the relatively large .45 caliber round, as the .45&#x27;s loud report could often leave one temporarily deaf when fired in a confined space. Consequently, some preferred to clear tunnels armed with a .38 Special revolver equipped with a sound suppressor and other non-standard weapons. &quot;A few of the OSS-ordered World War II era suppressed High Standard HD .22 automatics made their way into Tunnel Rat hands. But these weapons were very few in number and wanted by a number of other special units. Personal weapons were used by the rats, ranging from .25 caliber automatics to sawn-off shotguns.&quot;

Besides enemy combatants, the tunnels themselves presented many potential dangers to tunnel rats. Sometimes they were poorly constructed and they would simply collapse. Tunnels were often booby trapped with hand grenades, anti-personnel mines, and punji sticks. The VC would even use venomous snakes (placed as living booby traps). Rats, spiders, scorpions, and ants also posed threats to tunnel rats. Bats also roosted in the tunnels, although they were generally more of a nuisance than a threat. Tunnel construction occasionally included anti-intruder features such as U-bends that could be flooded quickly to trap and drown the tunnel rat. Sometimes poison gases were used. A tunnel rat might therefore choose to enter the tunnels wearing a gas mask (donning one within was frequently impossible in such a confined space). According to U.S. tunnel rat veterans, however, most tunnel rats usually went without gas masks because wearing one made it even harder to see, hear, and breathe in the narrow dark passages.

Tunnel rats were generally men of smaller stature ( and under), who were able to maneuver more comfortably in the narrow tunnels. Tom Mangold and John Penycate, authors of one of the definitive accounts of tunnel warfare during the Vietnam War, reported that the U.S. tunnel rats were almost exclusively soldiers of European or Hispanic descent, many of whom were Puerto Rican or Mexican American.

By Mangold and Penycate&#x27;s account, the tunnel rats first garnered public attention in January 1966, after a combined U.S. and Australian operation against the Củ Chi tunnels in Bình Dương Province, known as Operation Crimp. The &quot;Diehards&quot; of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 1st Engineer Battalion later were tunnel rats during their rotation through the Củ Chi District of South Vietnam in 1969.

In the years since the Vietnam War ended, tunnel rats have suffered from a high percentage of Agent Orange injuries and diseases due to soldiers&#x27; exposure to the chemicals on the ground, or that leached from topsoil into the tunnel environment. While in the tunnels, soldiers were breathing air heavily saturated with Agent Orange.

==In Afghanistan==
Afghanistan features an extensive series of historic tunnels used for transporting water and the &quot;kariz.&quot; During the 1979–1989 Soviet war in Afghanistan, such tunnels were used by Mujahideen fighters. The Soviet 40th Army therefore fielded their own tunnel clearance and demolition units, which were given the task of clearing the tunnels of enemy combatants, disarming booby traps, and destroying the underground complexes. According to contemporary accounts, the U.S. Marine Corps and British Royal Marines were involved in similar work in the war in Afghanistan.

==In Israel==
SAMOOR (, &quot;weasel&quot;), a formation within Israel&#x27;s Yahalom elite combat engineer unit, is charged with many of the same missions that tunnel rats performed during the Vietnam War.

<text>Garth Ennis (born 16 January 1970) is a Northern Irish-American comics writer, best known for the Vertigo series &quot;Preacher&quot; with artist Steve Dillon, his nine-year run on Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Punisher&quot; franchise, and &quot;The Boys&quot; with artist Darick Robertson. He has collaborated with artists such as Dillon and Glenn Fabry on &quot;Preacher&quot;, John McCrea on &quot;Hitman&quot;, Marc Silvestri on &quot;The Darkness&quot;, and Carlos Ezquerra on both &quot;Preacher&quot; and &quot;Hitman&quot;. His work has won him recognition in the comics industry, including nominations for the Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Award for Favorite Writer in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000. Like his inspiration, Allan Moore, he is an effective promoter of left-liberal ideas, for which he has received numerous awards and recognition from specialized British and American publications and organizations, such as the UK Comic Art Award and the Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Awards. 

==Early life==
Ennis is originally from Northern Ireland.

Raised with no religion, Ennis&#x27;s first exposure to the idea of God was as a six-year-old in primary school. Ennis&#x27;s teacher told the class that God was a being who could see inside their hearts, was always around them, and would ultimately reward or punish them. Ennis described the idea as bewildering, strange and terrifying. He later used this experience in his comic book series &quot;Preacher&quot;, whose protagonist is slapped after telling his grandmother that he finds the concept of God &quot;scary&quot;. Although the fictional violence in that story was not reflected in Ennis&#x27;s real-life upbringing, his classmates later reassured each other that they all loved God, though Ennis said, &quot;I think I hate him.&quot; Ennis later asked his mother about God, and when she asked him what he thought about the idea, Ennis responded, &quot;It sounds kind of stupid,&quot; a statement the adult Ennis clarified was meant to mask his fear. His mother&#x27;s response was, &quot;Well, there you are, then.&quot;

In 1987, Ennis befriended artist John McCrea while shopping at the first comic book specialty shop in Belfast, which had been opened by McCrea and another friend. Ennis would later ask McCrea to illustrate his first professional comics project. It was here that Ennis first met comics writer Alan Moore, who advised him to focus on creator-owned work rather than letting comic companies take ownership of his intellectual property.

==Career==
===UK work===
Ennis began his comic-writing career on his nineteenth birthday in 1989, with the series &quot;Troubled Souls&quot; in the British anthology &quot;Crisis&quot;. Illustrated by Ennis&#x27;s friend John McCrea, as living in Northern Ireland meant he did not require reference material for the Belfast-based series, it tells the story of a young, Protestant man caught up by fate in the violence of the Irish Troubles. It spawned a sequel, &quot;For a Few Troubles More&quot;, a broad comedy featuring two supporting characters from &quot;Troubled Souls&quot;, Dougie and Ivor. In 1997, American publisher Caliber released &quot;Dicks&quot;, serving as another Dougie and Ivor adventure. Several follow-ups featuring these characters were subsequently published by Avatar Press.

In explaining why he chose to write &quot;Troubled Souls&quot; as his debut comics work, Ennis explained, &quot;It was the kind of thing that was doing well at the time. I ought to be completely clear and say that, with hindsight, what Troubled Souls really represented was naked ambition. It was a direct attempt to get published. And that was the road that seemed most likely to lead me to success.&quot;

Another series for &quot;Crisis&quot; was &quot;True Faith&quot;, a religious satire inspired by his school days, drawn by Warren Pleece. A collected edition was issued in 1990 but a series of complaints from churches and religious groups led to it being quickly withdrawn from sale. It was republished in 1997 by the U.S. DC Comics imprint Vertigo. The plot follows an atheist teenager attending Christian school. After publicly insulting his classmates&#x27; religion to get back at a girl he was interested in who did not return his romantic feelings, the boy attracts the attention of a maltheist and is coerced into helping him murder clergy and bomb churches. Following the death of the maltheist, the book ends with the atheistic hero willingly carrying out a shooting at his Christian school. In the introduction to the Vertigo edition, Ennis described this as wish-fulfillment. Shortly after, Ennis began to write for the UK comics series &quot;2000 AD&quot;, and later wrote stories for the title&#x27;s flagship character, Judge Dredd, taking over from creator John Wagner for several years. Ennis&#x27;s &quot;Dredd&quot; stories include &quot;Muzak Killer&quot;, a satirical attack on mainstream pop music; &quot;Emerald Isle&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek story set in Ennis&#x27;s native Ireland; and the 20-part &quot;Judgment Day&quot;. Ennis also contributed the story &quot;Time Flies&quot;, with artist Philip Bond, dealing with time-travel paradoxes and Nazis.

In 2001, following much work in the United States, Ennis briefly returned to UK comics to write the Judge Dredd story &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;. Ennis said afterward there was &quot;not a hope&quot; to his returning to writing Dredd as he was generally not happy with his run. &quot;I&#x27;m too close to Dredd. I like him too much. I can&#x27;t tamper with the formula; nor can I take the piss the way I do with superheroes&quot;.

===DC Comics===

In 1991, Ennis took over the horror series &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, from DC Comics&#x27; Vertigo imprint. He wrote the series through 1994, with Steve Dillon becoming the regular artist during the second half of Ennis&#x27;s run; Ennis and Dillon would later become regular collaborators on other comics, including the one-shot &quot;Heartland&quot;, exploring one of &quot;Hellblazer&quot;″s secondary characters. Years afterward, Ennis briefly returned to &quot;Hellblazer&quot; for the five-part &quot;Son of Man&quot; story with artist John Higgins.

Ennis and Dillon went on to create the 66-issue Vertigo series &quot;Preacher&quot;. Running from 1995 to 2000, &quot;Preacher&quot; has been cited as Ennis&#x27;s landmark work. Its plot concerns a preacher with supernatural powers who literally searches for the Christian God, who had abandoned His creation. Mixing influences from Western and horror films with twisted humor and religious satire, it drew plaudits for Ennis from all sections of the media; the &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper voted one of the &quot;Preacher&quot; collections its Book of the Week, and film director Kevin Smith described it as &quot;more fun than going to the movies.&quot; The AMC television series &quot;Preacher&quot;, adapted from the comic, premiered in 2016. From 1993 to 1995, Ennis worked with artist John McCrea on another DC title, &quot;The Demon&quot;, during which the duo introduced superpowered contract killer Tommy Monaghan, a character Ennis and McCrea would go on to use in the character&#x27;s own title, &quot;Hitman&quot;. With the exception of a reverent depiction of Superman, Ennis&#x27;s writing on &quot;Hitman&quot; was known for portraying superheroes as ridiculous, a characteristic commonly found in Ennis&#x27; material involving such characters. &quot;Hitman&quot; ran 60 issues from 1996 to 2001. Ennis also penned several &quot;Hitman&quot; specials and spinoffs. Following the main title&#x27;s cancellation, Ennis and McCrea returned to the world of &quot;Hitman&quot; for a &quot;Justice League&quot; crossover, and later a comedic miniseries following the supporting characters from &quot;Hitman&quot;, entitled &quot;Section Eight&quot;.

Other DC comics projects Ennis wrote include &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; for the Helix imprint; a run on &quot;The Authority&quot; for the Wildstorm imprint; and the first arc of the &quot;Authority&quot; spin-off series &quot;Midnighter&quot;, as well as a story for the series &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot; and the original creations &quot;Goddess&quot; and &quot;Pride &amp; Joy&quot;, all for the Vertigo imprint.

===Marvel Comics===
Ennis&#x27;s first work for Marvel was &quot;Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe&quot; in 1995. Ennis noted that he quit writing for Marvel after completing this work, as the dialogue in the comic had been altered without his consultation. Following the end of &quot;Hitman&quot;, Ennis was once again offered the chance to write &quot;The Punisher&quot; at Marvel. The initial 12-issue miniseries was illustrated by Steve Dillon, who also illustrated much of Ennis&#x27;s subsequent 37-issue run of the Marvel Knights &quot;Punisher&quot; series. No longer finding violence comedic in light of the September 11th terrorist attacks, Ennis relaunched &quot;The Punisher&quot; under Marvel&#x27;s MAX imprint, allowing for darker stories. His 60-issue run was released concurrently with several Ennis-penned &quot;Punisher&quot; miniseries such as &quot;Born&quot; and &quot;Barracuda&quot;, and the one-shots &quot;The End&quot;, &quot;The Cell&quot;, and &quot;The Tyger&quot;. The creators of &quot;&quot; have declared Ennis&#x27;s &quot;The Punisher MAX&quot; run to have been one of the major influences on the film, and Ennis and Dillon reunited for a &quot;Punisher: War Zone&quot; miniseries to tie-in with the film.

In 2008, Ennis ended his five-year run on the MAX imprint&#x27;s Punisher series to write the Marvel miniseries &quot;War Is Hell: The First Flight of the Phantom Eagle&quot;. Illustrated by Howard Chaykin, it featured the little-used character Phantom Eagle, a World War I pilot. Other series Ennis wrote for Marvel include &quot;Where Monsters Dwell&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, &quot;Hulk&quot;, &quot;Thor&quot;, and a series of Goran Parlov-illustrated Nick Fury stories under the MAX imprint. These stories stripped superspy Fury of his science-fiction trappings in favor of military and CIA situations, including a focus on the First Indochina War in one storyline.

===Independent publishers and creator-owned work===
Ennis has written a 2008 &quot;Dan Dare&quot; miniseries published by Virgin Comics, and origin stories for &quot;The Darkness&quot; for Image Comics and &quot;Shadow Man&quot; for Valiant Comics. Original comics Ennis has created include the 5-issue mini-series &quot;Seven Brothers&quot; for Virgin Comics, on which Ennis collaborated with film director John Woo, a vulgar superhero satire entitled &quot;The Pro&quot; for Image Comics, the post-apocalyptic &quot;Just a Pilgrim&quot; for Black Bull Press, and &quot;War Stories&quot; for DC and later Avatar Press.

Avatar has published the bulk of Ennis&#x27;s creator-owned material, which includes the post-9/11 war story &quot;303&quot;, a western entitled &quot;Streets of Glory&quot;, the extreme horror comic &quot;Crossed&quot;, &quot;Back to Brooklyn&quot;, a crime limited series co-written with Jimmy Palmiotti for Image Comics, &quot;Caliban&quot;, a science fiction horror series inspired by the movie &quot;Prometheus&quot;, and &quot;Chronicles of Wormwood&quot;, which dealt with the friendship between an African-American Jesus Christ and a benign Antichrist. In 2011, Avatar commissioned Ennis to write and direct an original short film, &quot;Stitched&quot;, produced to drum up support for a possible feature. Ennis was also the initial writer for the &quot;Stitched&quot; comic book tie-in, also published by Avatar.

Ennis has also done both creator-owned and commissioned work for Dynamite Entertainment, most notably &quot;The Boys&quot;. Mainly illustrated by co-creator Darick Robertson, who Ennis previously worked with on the Marvel series &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Boys&quot; ran for 72 issues before concluding in 2012. This creator-owned extended series was a superhero satire, bringing the genre to places far darker than Ennis had before, by not only portraying superheroes as ridiculous, but also amoral, malevolent, and deviant. Announced in 2006 and originally published by DC&#x27;s Wildstorm imprint, &quot;The Boys&quot; was initially cancelled after six issues. Ennis later explained that this was because DC Comics were uneasy with the anti-superhero tone of the work. The series was subsequently picked up by Dynamite. The series was successful and spawned spinoffs, including a mini-series focused on the villain protagonist Billy Butcher. In 2019, &quot;The Boys&quot; was adapted into a TV series by Amazon.

Other original projects for Dynamite include the Howard Chaykin-illustrated crime comic &quot;Red Team&quot; and a metaseries of war comics called &quot;Battlefields,&quot; made up of mini-series including &quot;Night Witches&quot;, &quot;Dear Billy&quot;, and &quot;Tankies&quot;. Among his commissioned material, Ennis wrote the pulp character &quot;The Shadow&quot; for Dynamite. In a surprise move, Ennis attempted to crowdfund a children&#x27;s book through the Kickstarter platform. Unable to secure a children&#x27;s book publisher due to its violent ending (in which the main character is eaten by a monster), &quot;Erf&quot; as the book became known, was ultimately published by Dynamite.

Ennis wrote &quot;Sara&quot; in October 2018 for TKO Studios, a war story following a team of female Russian snipers as they beat back the Nazi invaders during a brutal winter campaign on the WWII Eastern Front.

Ennis wrote &quot;Stringbags&quot; in 2020 for the U. S. Naval Institute. The graphic novel relates the adventures of Allied airmen who crewed a Swordfish airplane during World War II.

==Influences and views on comics==
Ennis has explained that as an avid reader of British war comics during his formative years, he did not read superhero comics until his late teens, at which point he found them ridiculous, although he frequently cites mid-eighties superhero material among his influences. For instance, Ennis noted that the first American comic book he read in its entirety and appreciated was &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; by Frank Miller, an author who would prove influential on Ennis&#x27;s subsequent work, with Ennis citing Miller&#x27;s portrayal of Nick Fury in &quot;&quot; as his model for writing the character. Ennis said he was &quot;blown away&quot; by Miller, as &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; was the first time he encountered a comic writer who approached his work like a novelist. While Ennis was already interested in a creative profession, Frank Miller&#x27;s material and other mid-eighties mature readers comics like &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; and &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; inspired him to look into specifically writing comics as a career.

Despite being influenced by superhero material and having written a number of superhero stories both for and outside Marvel and DC, Ennis is noted for subverting the genre and mocking the characters in this work. For example, in the 1995 one-shot special &quot;Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe&quot;, Ennis has the Punisher kill every single superhero and supervillain on Earth. As a World War II aficionado, Ennis also said he finds characters like Captain America &quot;borderline offensive, because to me the reality of World War II was very human people, ordinary flesh-and-blood guys who slogged it out in miserable, flooded foxholes. So adding some fantasy superhero narrative, that has always annoyed me a little bit.&quot; Nonetheless, Ennis has admitted to having appreciation for the idea behind Wonder Woman if not the character, and even to outright liking Superman, the latter of whom he was noted for writing respectfully in &quot;Hitman&quot;. Ennis has since explained that his issue with superhero comics is not over the genre in and of itself, but more over its dominance in the comic book industry and the constraints imposed on superhero stories by publishers. &quot;I find most superhero stories completely meaningless,&quot; Ennis said. &quot;Which is not to say I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s potential for the genre – Alan Moore and Warren Ellis have both done interesting work with the notion of what it might be like to be and think beyond human, see &quot;Miracleman&quot;, &quot;Watchmen&quot; and &quot;Supergod&quot;. But so long as the industry is geared towards fulfilling audience demand – ie, for the same brightly coloured characters doing the same thing forever – you&#x27;re never going to see any real growth. The stories can&#x27;t end, so they&#x27;ll never mean anything.&quot;

Ennis has remarked that in terms of Marvel and DC characters, he prefers the ones he describes as more grounded, such as the Punisher, John Constantine, and Nick Fury. In particular, Ennis describes the Punisher as resembling the British comics characters he loved as a child more than Marvel and DC superheroes, which provided him with a way to the character. Though his &quot;Constantine&quot; stories, such as &quot;Dangerous Habits&quot; (1991), are widely acclaimed, Ennis grew to dislike the character. He told &quot;Vulture&quot; in 2014 that he had come to find Constantine morally repulsive and had &quot;no desire to write a character who essentially gets his pals killed and then explains that they were doomed anyway, so why not just spend their lives and use them up.&quot;

==Personal life==
Ennis had become a citizen of the United States by July 2016.

Ennis is an atheist, and said he feels disdain toward religion. Ennis blamed growing up in Northern Ireland during the Troubles for influencing this attitude. While he was not directly involved in the conflict as a child, Ennis would hear about it each morning on the radio. Ennis has related that having been raised secular, religiously motivated violence made no sense as to him, characterizing such conflict as a disagreement among participants over &quot;how to worship their imaginary friend. That more than anything gave me my distrust of religion.&quot;

Ennis has maintained an interest in military history since childhood, inspired by the war comics from his youth.

<text>The Amethyst Ring is a 1983 historical novel by American writer Scott O&#x27;Dell, the third in the trilogy started by &quot;The Captive&quot; and &quot;Feathered Serpent&quot;. 

==Plot summary==
Julián Estaban, who is impersonating the Mayan god Kukulcán, fights and escapes from a powerful gold hungry conquistador, Hernán Cortés. Kukulcán&#x27;s followers captured Rodrigo Perdoza, a bishop carrying a message to Cortés to detain Julián. Julián wants to be a priest and asks the bishop many times to make him one, but in the end he lets the Mayan priest sacrifice him, and Julián takes the bishop&#x27;s amethyst ring. Cortés attacks and captures Kukulcán&#x27;s city, the City of the Seven Serpents, but Julián escapes to a friendly large village and helps them harvest and trade pearls. He then goes to a smaller trading town and partners with Tzom Zambac and they have a successful feathered cloak business. Fearing betrayal from Tzom, he leaves and eventually finds Francisco Pizarro, a conquistador who is taking a band of Spaniards to get gold from the Inca. They capture the Incan king Atahualpa, who has a room filled with gold to pay his ransom. The Spaniards try and kill him anyway. Julián leaves the group because of his disagreements with the trial. He searches for Chima, a daughter of Atahualpa, whom he has fallen in love with. He finds her and she rejects him because he is a Spaniard. Julián then uses all of his gold to sail back to Seville. There he meets Cantú the Dwarf, who is now very wealthy from gold. Cantú gives Julián a lot of gold, but he joins the Brothers of the Poor and gives it all to them. 

==Reception==
&quot;The Reading Teacher&#x27;s&quot; review said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether Scott O&#x27;Dell&#x27;s &quot;The Amethyst Ring&quot; will become a classic, or even whether it will be widely read now. But it is a tantalizing tale, based on a true one... O&#x27;Dell lays out mural after mural, telling us what happened in each one, but he&#x27;s a Sphinx when it comes to pronouncing judgments. That aside, he is a great storyteller and Julián is a great character.&quot;

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; also praised the book, saying that Julián&#x27;s character development &quot;and the small choices Julian [sic] makes along the way, have remained the compelling focus of a trilogy crackling with intrigue, historical spectacle, and the conflict of cultures that confounds his loyalties.&quot;

However, the book was criticized for its treatment of pre-Columbian cultures. Isabel Schon wrote in &quot;Journal of Reading&quot;, &quot;It is obvious that O&#x27;Dell, like many of us, is fascinated with the Mayan, Aztec, and Inca cultures. Thus, I view it as a real tragedy that in &quot;The Captive&quot; (1979), &quot;The Feathered Serpent&quot; (1981), and &quot;The Amethyst Ring&quot; (1983), a trilogy that begins with a pre-Columbian legend, he chose to dwell on only negative aspects of the Mayan culture... The trilogy is indeed a fast moving story of violence and intrigue; it is regrettable, however, that many of its young readers will be exposed to pre-Columbian cultures and the amazing conquest of Mexico through the half-truths and exaggerations of a dilettante historian.&quot;

<text>Lanao del Sur (; Meranaw and ; Jawi &quot;(Batang Arab)&quot;: ), officially the Province of Lanao del Sur, is a province in the Philippines located in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). The capital is the city of Marawi (the most populous in the province), and it borders Lanao del Norte to the north, Bukidnon to the east, and Maguindanao del Norte and Cotabato to the south. To the southwest lies Illana Bay, an arm of the Moro Gulf.

Situated in the interior of Lanao del Sur is Lake Lanao, the largest lake in Mindanao.

==Etymology==
&quot;Lanao&quot; means &quot;lake&quot;, derived from &quot;ranao&quot;. The province, situated at basin of Lake Lanao, is known as the land of the &quot;Maranaos&quot; (which means &quot;the &quot;people of the lake&quot;).

==History==
===Early history===
Prior to the arrival of Islam, the region already had a sophisticated culture, as embodied in various Maranao epics, chants, and recorded history. The people of Lanao used to adhere to Hinduism, polytheist animism, and Buddhism. During this era, various cultural icons developed, such as the torogan, the singkil dance, the darangen epic, the unique Maranao gong and metal craft culture, the sarimanok, the okir motif, and an indigenous suyat script.

===Spanish colonization===
Lanao was first explored by the Spaniards in 1689, upon which they discovered a well-settled community named &quot;Dansalan&quot; at the lake&#x27;s northern end. Lanao was the seat of the Sultanate of Lanao.

During the Pre-Spanish time, there were 4 important boundaries which held the power of appointing a new sultan namely: &quot;Bakayawan&quot;, &quot;Dalama&quot;, &quot;Madamba&quot; and &quot;Sawer&quot;. In appointing a new sultan the permission of these four boundaries are needed to validate the new sultan appointed to his position.

===Japanese occupation===
In 1942, it was occupied by the Japanese Imperial Forces who landed in Southern Lanao. On May 2, 1942, the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines José Abad Santos was killed by the Japanese Imperial forces in a firing squad at Malabang, Lanao del Sur. In 1945, the first of the liberation forces landed in Southern Lanao and liberated the area with United States, Philippine Commonwealth troops together with the Maranao guerrilla units. They used infantry weapons, the Maranao Kris, Barong and Kampilan swords against the Japanese forces in the &quot;Battle of Lanao&quot;.

===Philippine independence===
In 1956, &quot;Republic Act No. 1552&quot; changed the name &quot;Dansalan&quot; to &quot;Marawi&quot;, taken from the word &quot;rawi&quot;, referring to the reclining lilies abundant in the Agus River.

====Division====
In 1959, Lanao was divided into two provinces, Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur, under &quot;Republic Act No. 2228&quot;. Marawi was designated as the capital of Lanao del Sur. The city was renamed the &quot;Islamic City of Marawi&quot; in 1980, and is currently the Philippines&#x27; only city having a predominantly Muslim population.

====Proposed Maranaw province====
In 1971, &quot;Republic Act No. 6406&quot;, which sought to create a new province out of eastern Lanao del Sur (now corresponding to the province&#x27;s first congressional district), was approved on October 4, 1971. The province was to consist of the municipalities of Bubong, Ditsaan-Ramain (including what is now Buadiposo-Buntong), Kapai, Lumba-Bayabao (including what is now Maguing), Marantao, Masiu, Mulondo, Saguiaran, Piagapo, Poona Bayabao, Tamparan, Taraka and Wao (including what is now Bumbaran), with the chartered city of Marawi serving as the new provincial capital. The division never took place due to the declaration of Martial law in the Philippines on September 21, 1972, which disrupted the elections for 1973.

====Inclusion to the ARMM ====
In a 1989 plebiscite, Lanao del Sur voted to join the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), but the city of Marawi voted to remain outside the ARMM. It later joined ARMM in 2001 following the plebiscite that sought to expand the autonomous region.

=== Contemporary ===
The Battle of Marawi began and ended in 2017. The battle was against ISIL-affiliated militants, a number of which were Malaysian citizens. The battle destroyed most of the cityscape of Marawi and killed hundreds of civilians and Filipino soldiers.

A petition was released in support for the usage of the torogan as inspiration for the rehabilation of Marawi after the Battle of Marawi. The petition was released in opposition to the possible Manila Rehabilation Effect that the government plans to impose. The Manila-style rehabilation would establish shanty houses and buildings without Maranao architectural styles, thus destroying Marawi&#x27;s Maranao cultural skyline. The petition advocates a Warsaw-style Rehabilation Effect, where the culture and styles of a particular area is used as foundation for rehabilitation of built heritage and landscape. Among the local architectural styles that may be used under the Warsaw-style are the okir, sarimanok, and inspirations from the torogan. The Warsaw-style is also foreseen to boost tourism in the city in the long-run due to the cultural aesthetics it would bring.

==UNESCO Designations in Lanao del Sur==
UNESCO has inscribed one Maranao element, the &quot;Darangen Chants of the Maranao People of Lake Lanao,&quot; in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008. The element was earlier inscribed in the UNESCO Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity Representative List in 2005. The organization has also designated the Old Town of Tugaya as a &quot;UNESCO Home for Culture and Heritage&quot;. UNESCO has recommended for the nomination of Tugaya and all of Lanao del Sur&#x27;s traditional crafts heritage in Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, following reports made in 2014 and 2015. The Philippine ambassador to UNESCO and France noted that it will be better to inscribe Maranao&#x27;s traditional crafts in the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding as they have been endangered due to the 2017 Battle of Marawi. The nomination is being finalized by the Philippine government, as announced in 2018. The torogans of Lanao are also recommended by UNESCO to be nominated in the World Heritage List once proper documentation and restoration has been completed. Two torogans have been bought by a controversial heritage resort company, Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar, and were transported to Bataan, sparking a provincial campaign to get back the two royal houses to their ancestral homeland.

<text>Arthur Rubinstein KBE OMRI (; 28 January 1887 – 20 December 1982) was a Polish-American pianist. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest pianists of all time. He received international acclaim for his performances of the music written by a variety of composers and many regard him as one of the greatest Chopin interpreters of his time. He played in public for eight decades. His repertoire also included the works of Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, Liszt, Tchaikovsky, Saint-Saëns, Schumann and more.

== Early life ==
Arthur Rubinstein was born in Łódź, Congress Poland (part of the Russian Empire for the entire time Rubinstein resided there) on 28 January 1887, to a Jewish family. He was the youngest of seven children of Felicja Blima Fajga (née Heiman) and Izaak Rubinstein. His father owned a small textile factory.

Rubinstein&#x27;s birth name was to be &quot;Leo&quot;, but his eight-year-old brother claimed that &quot;His name must be Artur. Since Artur X (a neighbour&#x27;s son) plays the violin so nicely, the baby may also become a great musician!&quot; Thus, he was called Artur, although in English-speaking countries, he preferred to be known as &quot;Arthur Rubinstein&quot;. His United States impresario Sol Hurok, however, insisted he be billed as &quot;Artur&quot;, and records were released in the West under both versions of his name.

At age two, Rubinstein demonstrated absolute pitch and a fascination with the piano, watching his elder sister&#x27;s piano lessons. By the age of four, he was recognised as a child prodigy. His father had a predilection for the violin and offered Rubinstein a violin; but Rubinstein rejected it because he thought his instinct was for harmony and polyphony. The Hungarian violinist Joseph Joachim, on hearing the four-year-old child play the piano, was greatly impressed, telling Arthur&#x27;s family, &quot;This boy may become a very great musician—he certainly has the talent for it... When the time comes for serious study, bring him to me, and I shall be glad to supervise his artistic education.&quot; On 14 December 1894, seven-year-old Arthur Rubinstein had his debut with pieces by Mozart, Schubert and Mendelssohn.

When he turned ten, Rubinstein moved to Berlin to continue his studies, and gave his first performance with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1900, at the age of 13. Joachim entrusted Rubinstein to Karl Heinrich Barth as his piano teacher. As a student of Barth, Rubinstein inherited a renowned pedagogical lineage: Barth was himself a pupil of Liszt, who had been taught by Czerny, who had in turn been a pupil of Beethoven.

==Music and career==
In 1904, Rubinstein moved to Paris to launch his career in earnest, where he met the composers Maurice Ravel and Paul Dukas and the violinist Jacques Thibaud. He also played Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27; Piano Concerto No. 2 in the presence of the composer. Through the family of Juliusz Wertheim, whose understanding of Chopin&#x27;s genius inspired Rubinstein, he formed friendships with the violinist Paul Kochanski and composer Karol Szymanowski.

Rubinstein made his New York debut at Carnegie Hall in 1906, and thereafter toured the United States, Austria, Italy, and Russia. According to his own testimony and that of his son in François Reichenbach&#x27;s film &quot;L&#x27;Amour de la vie&quot; (1969), he was not well received in the United States. By 1908, Rubinstein, destitute and desperate, hounded by creditors, and threatened with being evicted from his Berlin hotel room, made a failed attempt to hang himself. Subsequently, he said that he felt &quot;reborn&quot; and endowed with an unconditional love of life. In 1912, he made his London debut, and found a musical home there in the Edith Grove, Chelsea, musical salon of Paul and Muriel Draper, in company with Igor Stravinsky, Kochanski, Thibaud, Pablo Casals, Pierre Monteux and others.

During World War I, Rubinstein stayed in London, giving recitals and accompanying the violinist Eugène Ysaÿe. In 1916 and 1917, he made his first tours in Spain and South America where he was widely acclaimed. It was during those tours that he developed a lifelong enthusiasm for the music of Enrique Granados, Isaac Albéniz, Manuel de Falla, and Heitor Villa-Lobos. He was the dedicatee of Manuel de Falla&#x27;s &quot;Fantasía Bética&quot;, Villa-Lobos&#x27;s &quot;Rudepoêma&quot; and Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Trois mouvements de Petrouchka&quot;.

Rubinstein was appalled by Germany&#x27;s conduct during World War I, particularly the atrocities in Belgium and never played there again. His last performance in Germany was in 1914. His dislike of Germany was not improved during and after World War II when most of his family back in Poland were killed during the Holocaust. (Rubinstein has said many times to interviewers that there were two countries where he would not play: Tibet, because it is too high, and Germany, because it is too low.)

In the autumn of 1919 Rubinstein toured Great Britain with soprano Emma Calvé and tenor Vladimir Rosing.

In 1921, Rubinstein gave two American tours, travelling to New York City with Karol Szymanowski and his close friend Paul Kochanski. During his recital in Florida, Rubinstein was accompanied by violinist virtuoso Rudolph Bochoco.

In 1934, the pianist, who stated he neglected his technique in his early years, relying instead on natural talent, withdrew from concert life for several months of intensive study and practice.

Rubinstein toured the United States again in 1937, his career becoming centered there during the World War II years when he lived in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California. He became a naturalized US citizen in 1946.
During his time in California, Rubinstein provided the piano soundtrack for several films, including &quot;Song of Love&quot; with Katharine Hepburn. He appeared, as himself, in the films &quot;Carnegie Hall&quot; and &quot;Of Men and Music&quot;.

Although best known as a recitalist and concerto soloist, Rubinstein was considered an outstanding chamber musician, partnering with Henryk Szeryng, Jascha Heifetz, Pablo Casals, Gregor Piatigorsky and the Guarneri Quartet. Rubinstein recorded much of the core piano repertoire, particularly that of the Romantic composers. At the time of his death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; in describing him wrote, &quot;Chopin was his specialty ... it was [as] a Chopinist that he was considered by many without peer.&quot; With the exception of the Études, he recorded most of the works of Chopin. In 1964, during the Cold War, he gave a legendary concert in Moscow, with a pure Chopin program. He was one of the earliest champions of Spanish and South American composers, as well as French composers of the early 20th century (such as Debussy and Ravel). In addition, Rubinstein promoted the music of his compatriot Karol Szymanowski. Rubinstein, in conversation with Alexander Scriabin, named Brahms as his favorite composer, a response that enraged Scriabin.

In 1969, the film &quot;Arthur Rubinstein – The Love of Life&quot; was released; it won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. (A later TV special, &quot;Rubinstein at 90&quot;, highlighted how he had been playing for people for eight decades.)

By the mid-1970s, Rubinstein&#x27;s eyesight had begun to deteriorate. He retired from the stage at age 89 in May 1976, giving his last concert at London&#x27;s Wigmore Hall, where he had first played nearly 70 years before.

Rubinstein, who was fluent in eight languages, held much of the repertoire (and not only that of the piano) in his formidable memory. According to his memoirs, he learned César Franck&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot; while on a train en route to the concert, without the benefit of a piano, practicing passages in his lap. Rubinstein described his memory as photographic, to the extent that he would visualize an errant coffee stain while recalling a score.

Rubinstein also had exceptionally developed aural abilities, which allowed him to play whole symphonies in his mind. &quot;At breakfast, I might pass a Brahms symphony in my head,&quot; he said. &quot;Then I am called to the phone, and half an hour later I find it&#x27;s been going on all the time and I&#x27;m in the third movement.&quot; This ability was often tested by Rubinstein&#x27;s friends, who would randomly pick extracts from opera and symphonic scores and ask him to play them from memory.

Rubinstein&#x27;s autobiography contained two volumes: &quot;My Young Years&quot; (1973); and &quot;My Many Years&quot; (1980). Many were displeased by their emphasis on personal anecdotes over music. Pianist Emanuel Ax, one of Rubinstein&#x27;s greatest admirers, was profoundly disappointed by reading &quot;My Many Years&quot;: &quot;Until then,&quot; he told Harvey Sachs, &quot;I had idolized Rubinstein—I had wanted to have a life like his, the book changed all that.&quot;

In a reflective muse, Rubinstein once noted &quot;It is simply my life, music. I live it, breathe it, talk with it. I am almost unconscious of it. No, I do not mean I take it for granted—one should never take for granted any of the gifts of God. But it is like an arm, a leg, part of me. On the other hand, books and paintings and languages and people are passions with me, always to be cultivated. Travel too. I am a lucky man to have a business which allows me to be on the road so much. On the train, the plane, I have time to read. There again, I am a lucky man to be a pianist. A splendid instrument, the piano, just the right size so that you cannot take it with you. Instead of practicing, I can read. A fortunate fellow, am I not?&quot;

==Personal life==
===Marriage and family===
Of his youth, Rubinstein once said: &quot;It is said of me that when I was young I divided my time impartially among wine, women and song. I deny this categorically. Ninety percent of my interests were women.&quot; At the age of 45, in 1932, Rubinstein married Nela Młynarska, a 24-year-old Polish ballerina (who had studied with Mary Wigman). Nela was the daughter of the Polish conductor Emil Młynarski and his wife Anna Talko-Hryncewicz, who was from a Polish aristocratic heraldic family of Iłgowski coat of arms. Nela had first fallen in love with Rubinstein when she was 18, but married Mieczysław Munz, another Polish-American pianist, after Rubinstein began an affair with an Italian princess. Nela subsequently divorced Munz and three years later married Rubinstein. They had five children (one died in infancy), including photographer Eva Rubinstein, who married William Sloane Coffin, and son John Rubinstein, a Tony Award-winning actor and father of actor Michael Weston. Nela subsequently wrote &quot;Nela&#x27;s Cookbook&quot;, which included the dishes she prepared for the couple&#x27;s legendary parties.

Both before and during his marriage, Rubinstein carried on a series of affairs with women, including Lesley Jowitt, the wife of the British politician William Jowitt, and Irene Curzon.

In addition to fathering a daughter (Brazilian pianist Luli Oswald) with the Italian marchioness Paola Medici del Vascello (née Princess Paola di Viggiano, also: Donna Paola Sanfelice dei Principi di Viggiano), he may have been the father of American decorator and artist Muriel Draper&#x27;s son Sanders Draper, who died in World War II. Luli Oswald was never recognised by her biological parents, hidden from the public and given as a newborn to a friend of Rubinstein&#x27;s, the Brazilian conductor and composer Henrique Oswald (1852-1931). The latter&#x27;s daughter Maria and her husband Odoardo Marchesini raised her and adopted her. The adoptive parents signed an affidavit in 1967 stating that Luli Oswald had been entrusted to them by her biological parents Paola Medici and Arthur Rubinstein because she was the &quot;fruit of a forbidden love.&quot; After the adoption, her name was Margarida Henriqueta Marchesini. Oswald later performed under the stage name Luli Oswald.

Though he and Nela never divorced, in 1977, at age 90, he left her for Annabelle Whitestone, then 33 years old.

===Jewish identity===
An agnostic, Rubinstein was proud of his Jewish heritage. He was a great friend of Israel, which he visited several times with his wife and children, giving concerts with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, recitals, and master classes at the Jerusalem Music Centre.
In 1949, Rubinstein—who lost family members in the Holocaust—along with other prominent musicians (including Horowitz and Heifetz) announced that he would not appear with the Chicago Symphony if it engaged the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, who had remained in Germany during the war and who had performed a symphony for Hitler&#x27;s birthday.

===Polish identity===
Throughout his life, Rubinstein was deeply attached to Poland. At the inauguration of the United Nations in 1945, Rubinstein showed his Polish patriotism at a concert for the delegates. He began the concert by stating his deep disappointment that the conference did not have a delegation from Poland. Rubinstein later described becoming overwhelmed by a blind fury and angrily pointing out to the public the absence of the Polish flag. He stopped playing the piano, told the audience to stand up, including the Soviets, and played the Polish national anthem loudly and slowly, repeating the final part in a great thunderous &quot;forte&quot;. When he had finished, the public gave him a great ovation.

=== Charitable contributions ===

Rubinstein was active in supporting charities throughout his life. He performed charity concerts to raise donations for numerous organizations which interested him. In 1961, he performed ten recitals in Carnegie Hall to raise roughly $100,000 for charities including Big Brothers, United Jewish Appeal, Polish Assistance, Musicians Emergency fund, the National Association for Mental Health, and the Legal Defense Fund of the National Advancement of Colored People.

=== On practice ===

In his two autobiographies, Rubinstein is often intensely self-critical. A natural pianist with a big technique, he claimed that he practiced as little as possible, learning new pieces quickly and with insufficient attention to detail, relying on his charm and charisma to conceal the lack of finish in his playing. The literal truth of these self-directed critiques is open to question: Rubinstein wasn&#x27;t averse to making himself the butt of a good story. Even so, he insisted that his attitude toward practicing changed after his marriage. He stated that he did not want his children to see him as a second-rater, so he began in the summer of 1934 to restudy his entire repertoire. &quot;I buckled down back to work—six hours, eight hours, nine hours a day.&quot; he recalled in 1958. &quot;And a strange thing happened. ... I began to discover new meanings, new qualities, new possibilities in music that I have been regularly playing for more than 30 years.&quot; In general, however, Rubinstein believed that excessive practice could be dangerous for young pianists. Perhaps recalling his own youthful brush with repetitive-stress syndrome, Rubinstein regularly advised that young pianists should practice no more than three hours a day. &quot;I was born very, very lazy and I don&#x27;t always practice very long&quot;, he said, &quot;but I must say, in my defense, that it is not so good, in a musical way, to overpractice. When you do, the music seems to come out of your pocket. If you play with a feeling of &#x27;Oh, I know this&#x27;, you play without that little drop of fresh blood that is necessary—and the audience feels it.&quot; Of his own practice methods, he said, &quot;At every concert I leave a lot to the moment. I must have the unexpected, the unforeseen. I want to risk, to dare. I want to be surprised by what comes out. I want to enjoy it more than the audience. That way the music can bloom anew. It&#x27;s like making love. The act is always the same, but each time it&#x27;s different.&quot;

=== Pupils ===
Rubinstein was reluctant to teach in his earlier life, refusing to accept William Kapell&#x27;s request for lessons. It was not until the late 1950s that he accepted his first pupil, Dubravka Tomšič Srebotnjak. Other pupils of Rubinstein include François-René Duchâble, Avi Schönfeld, Ann Schein Carlyss, Eugen Indjic, Janina Fialkowska, Dean Kramer and Marc Laforêt. Rubinstein also gave master classes towards the end of his life.

==Death and legacy==
Rubinstein died in his sleep at his home in Geneva, Switzerland, on 20 December 1982, at the age of 95. His remains were cremated two days later. On the first anniversary of his death, an urn holding his ashes was buried in Jerusalem—as specified in his will—in a dedicated plot now dubbed &quot;Rubinstein Forest&quot; overlooking the Jerusalem Forest. This was arranged by then-mayor Teddy Kollek with Israel&#x27;s Chief Rabbis, who had objected to Rubinstein&#x27;s wish of having his ashes strewn over the Jerusalem Forest, given that Jewish law prohibits cremation and the forest is a public park, and as such falls under the religious law governing cemeteries.

In October 2007, his family donated to the Juilliard School an extensive collection of original manuscripts, manuscript copies and published editions that had been seized by the Germans during World War II from his Paris residence. Seventy-one items were returned to his four children, marking the first time that Jewish property kept in the Berlin State Library was returned to the legal heirs.

In 1974, Jan Jacob Bistritzky established the Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Master Competition, held every three years in Israel, intended to promote the careers of young and outstanding pianists. The Arthur Rubinstein Award and other prizes are presented to the winners. The Rubinstein Competition also commissions works by Israeli composers.

There is an Arthur Rubinstein Street in Tel Aviv and in Białogard (Polish: &quot;ulica Artura Rubinsteina&quot;) and an Arthur Rubinstein Passage in Łódź (Polish: &quot;aleja Artura Rubinsteina&quot;).

==Recordings==

In 1910, Rubinstein recorded Franz Liszt&#x27;s Hungarian Rhapsody No. 10 for the Polish Favorit label. The pianist was displeased with the acoustic recording process, saying it made the piano sound &quot;like a banjo&quot; and he did not record again until the advent of electrical recording. However, Rubinstein made numerous player piano music rolls for the Aeolian Duo-Art system and the American Piano Company (AMPICO) in the 1920s.

Beginning in 1928, Rubinstein began to record extensively for the His Master&#x27;s Voice and for RCA Victor in the United States, making a large number of solo, concerto and chamber music recordings until his retirement in 1976. As recording technology improved, from 78-rpm discs to LPs and stereophonic recordings, Rubinstein re-recorded much of his repertoire. All of his RCA Victor recordings have been reissued on compact disc and amount to about 107 hours of music.

Rubinstein preferred to make studio recordings and during his lifetime approved for release only around three hours of live recordings. However, since his death, several labels have issued many of his live recordings sourced from various radio broadcasts.

A recording of Rubinstein&#x27;s version of Chopin&#x27;s Minute Waltz has served as the theme music for the BBC Radio 4 show &quot;Just a Minute&quot; since the programme&#x27;s inception.

<text>Seek and destroy (also known as search and destroy, or S&amp;D) is a military strategy which consists of inserting infantry forces into hostile territory and directing them to search and then attack enemy targets before immediately withdrawing. First used as part of counterinsurgency operations during military conflicts in Southeast Asia such as the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War, the strategy was developed to take advantage of new technological capabilities available to Western militaries such as the helicopter, which allowed for the adoption of new tactics like the air assault. 

Primarily used in jungle warfare, the strategy was developed with asymmetric tactics in mind rather than conventional warfare. A related strategy known as clear and hold, which entailed military forces clearing an area of enemy personnel and then keeping the area clear of enemies while winning the local population&#x27;s support, was developed around the same period and used alongside the search and destroy strategy. Body counts were commonly used to determine the success of the strategy, which entailed fighting a war of attrition against an insurgency. 

== Malayan Emergency ==

During the Malayan Emergency, British forces conducted numerous search and destroy (S&amp;D) operations in the Malayan countryside (which largely consisted of jungles) to flush out Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA) guerrillas. The Ferret Force, a short-lived British counterinsurgency (COIN) unit which existed from July to December 1948, served as an important source of military intelligence for S&amp;D missions against the MNLA. Ferret Force personnel would gather intelligence, including from native informants and prisoners, as to the whereabouts of MNLA insurgents, which would then be provided to troops assigned to S&amp;D operations. Once MNLA insurgents had been flushed out, they would then be further harassed via asymmetric warfare tactics such as being denied sources of food and shelter, before either surrendering or being killed in a direct military engagement, most commonly an ambush.

Ultimately, many British officials came to the conclusion that their S&amp;D tactics were working poorly. Troops assigned to S&amp;D missions would often use heavy-handed tactics on individuals and settlements suspected of supporting the MNLA, alienating the local population. MNLA insurgents held numerous advantages over their British opponents, including residing in closer proximity to the countryside&#x27;s population and having familial relations or close friendships among local villagers. While MNLA insurgents rarely directly engaged British forces, they frequently targeted civilians to elicit material support. Patrols in the jungle, a common part of British S&amp;D operations, were unpopular with the troops due to having to spend significant periods of time navigating unfamiliar terrain filled with dangerous animals and insects while concomitantly watching out for MNLA ambushes. British forces, unable to distinguish friend from foe, had to adjust to the constant risk of an insurgent attack. These fears led to incidents such as the Batang Kali massacre, in which 24 unarmed villagers were killed by soldiers of the Scots Guards regiment.

== Vietnam War ==

Search and destroy became an offensive tool that was crucial to General William Westmoreland&#x27;s second phase during the Vietnam War. In his three-phase strategy, the first was to tie down the Viet Cong, the second phase was to resume the offensive and destroy the enemy, and the third phase was to restore the area under South Vietnamese government control. Most &quot;Zippo&quot; missions (so named for the Zippo lighters used to set fire to villages believed to be aligned with the Viet Cong) were assigned to the second phase around 1966 and 1967, along with clear-and-secure operations. Search-and-destroy missions entailed sending out platoons, companies, or larger detachments of US troops from a fortified position to locate and destroy communist units in the countryside. These missions most commonly involved hiking out into the &quot;boonies&quot; and setting an ambush in the brush, near a suspected Viet Cong trail. The ambush typically involved the use of fixed Claymore antipersonnel mines, crossing lines of small arms fire, mortar support, and possibly additional artillery support called in via radio from a nearby fire support base.

In February 1967, some of the largest Zippo missions were conducted in the Iron Triangle, between Saigon and Routes 13 and 25. The area had a mass centre of Viet Cong logistics and headquarters, with some of the most high-ranking NLF officials stationed there. The offensive began with Operation Junction City, where the American units assigned had destroyed hundreds of tons of rice, killed 720 guerrillas, and captured 213 prisoners. However, the number of defenders in the Iron Triangle area was thought to be over 10,000. The offensive failed to destroy the NLF&#x27;s headquarters or to capture any high-ranking officers and so it had little effect toward Hanoi&#x27;s plan. Both search-and-destroy and clear-and-hold missions stretched into the third phase, which began in 1968. The number of missions mounted, especially after the US was hit by General Võ Nguyên Giáp&#x27;s Tet offensive in 1968. As the war grew more aggressive, so did the missions, and search-and-destroy and clear-and-secure operations became merged.

Search-and-destroy missions had many flaws. First, there was lack of distinction between clearing and search-and-destroy missions. Thus, clearing missions, which were less aggressive, eventually morphed into a more violent and brutal form of tactic, just as search-and-destroy missions were. With the lack of distinction between clearing, and search-and-destroy missions, pacification was not pushed. Such a response led to the Mỹ Lai massacre of 1968, where American troops massacred at least 347 Vietnamese civilians. Guenter Lewy, a professor of Political Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, argued that the generals and war planners severely underestimated the enemy&#x27;s abilities to match and even to exceed US forces. Large numbers of Viet Cong troops would be killed or captured, but they were quickly replaced. Enemy forces were initially pushed out of certain territories, but as soon as the American forces left the areas, they simply returned with more reinforcements and weapons.

The effectiveness of the missions is also doubtful. In one of the first search-and-destroy missions northwest of Dầu Tiếng, named Operation Attleboro, a US report states that 115 U.S. soldiers were killed, and the North Vietnamese lost 1,062. In Operation Junction City, the report also states that 282 US soldiers were killed, and the Viet Cong lost 1,728 guerrillas. Those estimated figures, however, should be considered in light of how they were obtained. They were almost exclusively gathered by indirect means: sensor readings, sightings of secondary explosions, reports of defectors or prisoners of war, and inference or extrapolation.

<text>In physics, the Schwinger model, named after Julian Schwinger, is the model describing 1+1D (1 spatial dimension + time) &quot;Lorentzian&quot; quantum electrodynamics which includes electrons, coupled to photons. 

The model defines the usual QED Lagrangian

:formula_1

over a spacetime with one spatial dimension and one temporal dimension. Where formula_2 is the formula_3 photon field strength, formula_4 is the gauge covariant derivative, formula_5 is the fermion spinor, formula_6 is the fermion mass and formula_7 form the two-dimensional representation of the Clifford algebra.

This model exhibits confinement of the fermions and as such, is a toy model for QCD. A handwaving argument why this is so is because in two dimensions, classically, the potential between two charged particles goes linearly as formula_8, instead of formula_9 in 4 dimensions, 3 spatial, 1 time. This model also exhibits a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the U(1) symmetry due to a chiral condensate due to a pool of instantons. The photon in this model becomes a massive particle at low temperatures. This model can be solved exactly and is used as a toy model for other more complex theories.

<text>Otis Spann (March 21, 1924, or 1930April 24, 1970) was an American blues musician many consider the leading postwar Chicago blues pianist.

==Early life==
Sources differ over Spann&#x27;s early years. Some state that he was born in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1930, but researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc concluded, based on census records and other official information, that he was born in 1924 in Belzoni, Mississippi.

Spann&#x27;s father was, according to some sources, a pianist called Friday Ford. His mother, Josephine Erby, was a guitarist who had worked with Memphis Minnie and Bessie Smith, and his stepfather, Frank Houston Spann, was a preacher and musician. One of five children, Spann began playing the piano at seven, with some instruction from Friday Ford, Frank Spann, and Little Brother Montgomery.

==Career==
By age 14, he was playing in bands in the Jackson area. He moved to Chicago in 1946, where Big Maceo Merriweather mentored him. Spann performed solo with the guitarist Morris Pejoe, working a regular spot at the Tic Toc Lounge. Spann was known for his distinctive piano style. He became Muddy Waters&#x27; piano player in late 1952 and participated in his first recording session with the band on September 24, 1953. He played on many of Waters&#x27; most famous songs, including the blues standards &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Ready,&quot; and &quot;Got My Mojo Working.&quot; During his tenure with the group, he continued to record as a solo artist and session player with other musicians, including Bo Diddley and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. He stayed with Muddy Waters until 1968.

Spann&#x27;s work for Chess Records includes the 1954 single &quot;It Must Have Been the Devil,&quot; backed with &quot;Five Spot,&quot; with B.B. King and Jody Williams on guitars. Sometimes, he is credited for playing piano on a couple of Chuck Berry songs, including &quot;You Can&#x27;t Catch Me&quot; (1956), but others indicate that it could have been Berry&#x27;s regular pianist Johnnie Johnson. In 1956, he recorded two unreleased tracks with Big Walter Horton and Robert Lockwood. He recorded a session with the guitarist Robert Lockwood, Jr. and vocalist St. Louis Jimmy in New York on August 23, 1960, which was issued on the albums &quot;Otis Spann Is the Blues&quot; and &quot;Walking the Blues&quot;. A 1963 session, Good Morning Mr. Blues, for Storyville Records was recorded in Copenhagen. He worked with Muddy Waters and Eric Clapton on recordings for Decca and with James Cotton for Prestige in 1964.

&quot;The Blues Is Where It&#x27;s At&quot;, Spann&#x27;s 1966 album for ABC-Bluesway, includes contributions from George &quot;Harmonica&quot; Smith, Muddy Waters, and Sammy Lawhorn. &quot;The Bottom of the Blues&quot; (1967), featuring Spann&#x27;s wife, Lucille Spann (June 23, 1938 – August 2, 1994), was released by Bluesway. He worked on albums with Buddy Guy, Big Mama Thornton, Peter Green, and Fleetwood Mac in the late 1960s. In 2012, Silk City Records released &quot; Someday,&quot; featuring live and studio performances from 1967 produced by the noted blues guitarist Son Lewis.

DVD recordings of Spann include his performances at the Newport Jazz Festival (1960), the American Folk Blues Festival (1963), the Blues Masters (1966), and the Copenhagen Jazz Festival (1968).

==Death==
Spann died of liver cancer in Chicago in 1970. He was buried in Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois. His grave was unmarked for almost thirty years until Steve Salter (president of the Killer Blues Headstone Project) wrote a letter to &quot;Blues Revue&quot; magazine, saying, &quot;This piano great is lying in an unmarked grave. Let&#x27;s do something about this deplorable situation.&quot; Blues enthusiasts from around the world sent donations to purchase a headstone. On June 6, 1999, the marker was unveiled in a private ceremony. The stone is inscribed, &quot;Otis played the deepest blues we ever heard – He&#x27;ll play forever in our hearts.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 1972, the Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz Festival site was named &quot;Otis Spann Memorial Field.&quot; That same year, &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau called Spann &quot;the greatest modern blues pianist.&quot; He later included Spann&#x27;s 1972 Barnaby compilation &quot;Walking the Blues&quot; in &quot;A Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s music, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981).

Spann was posthumously elected to the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980. On November 13, 2012, Spann (along with cousin and fellow pianist Little Johnnie Jones) received a Mississippi Blues Trail Marker plaque, erected at 547 South Roach Street in Jackson, Mississippi, where the family lived in the 1930s and 1940s.

<text>South Cotabato, officially the Province of South Cotabato, is a province in the Philippines located in the Soccsksargen region in Mindanao. Its capital is Koronadal (also the regional center of Soccsksargen), and it borders Sultan Kudarat to the north and west, Sarangani to the south and northeast, and Davao del Sur to the far northeast. To the southeast lies Sarangani Bay.

General Santos, the only coastal city/town located on the shores of Sarangani Bay, is the largest city in both the province and the region (by population), but is governed independently from the province. The province of Sarangani used to be part of South Cotabato until it was made an independent province in 1992.

==History==
===Early history===
Centuries ago, the area that would be the South Cotabato was sparsely inhabited by Maguindanaon pioneers and Lumads which are under Sultanate of Maguindanao&#x27;s influence. The Spaniards launched expeditions to subdue the area throughout the colonial era but they never gained control of the region until the middle of the 19th century after the Spaniards established a military post at what is now Barangay Tamontaka, one of the earliest Christian settlements founded south of the Philippines, in present-day Cotabato City. Spaniards already took with them Chavacano-speaking Christians and Muslims from Zamboanga and Basilan, as well as the Visayans, especially the Hiligaynons and Cebuanos.

===American invasion era===
The area of what is now South Cotabato and Sarangani provinces used to be part of Davao province until 1914, when the reorganization of the districts in Mindanao took place, thus it became part of the then-undivided Cotabato province. Settlers, who would lay the foundation of what would become a progressive province, started trooping down 1914.

The significant thrust occurred during the term of President Quezon in late 1930s. General Paulino Santos led the first of wave of settlers that time.

===Philippine independence===
After World War II, the final exodus of settlers from Luzon and Visayas poured into the area&#x27;s virgin land. In the early 1960s as population, trade and industries grew in southern part of Cotabato, a clamor of local self-governance arose. Thus, on July 18, 1966, South Cotabato was separated from Cotabato as an independent province. At that time, the province consisted of 11 municipalities, namely: Banga, South Cotabato, General Santos (now a city), Glan, Kiamba, Koronadal, Maitum, Norala, Polomolok, Surallah, Tantangan, and Tupi. These municipalities were established long before the creation of the province. Other component municipalities were formed after it fully functioned as a province.

With the creation of regions under Pres. Ferdinand Marcos, South Cotabato was grouped with Region XI, also known as &quot;Southern Mindanao&quot;, in 1975.

In 1992, the province of Sarangani was formed out of South Cotabato. Seven towns in southern and coastal section of the province (Malungon, Alabel, Malapatan, Glan, Maasim, Kiamba and Maitum) became part of the new province, leaving South Cotabato with 11 remaining municipalities.

Regional offices were relocated to South Cotabato in accordance with &quot;EO 429&quot; dated October 12, 1990, issued by President Corazon C. Aquino during the expansion of the newly created Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, and &quot;EO No. 36&quot; dated September 19, 2001, issued by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo which says South Cotabato is to be transferred from Southern Mindanao region to Region XII and having the city of Koronadal as the regional center of Region XII.

===Contemporary===
On August 16, 2000, &quot;Republic Act No. 8803&quot; was approved, that converted the municipality of Koronadal into a component city of South Cotabato.

In 2015, the &quot;National Competitiveness Council&quot; declared the province as the 4th most competitive province in the country.

===Inhabitants===
The people of South Cotabato have diverse heritages. The province&#x27;s indigenous people are Blaan, Tboli and Maguindanaon. Ethnic Hiligaynons, descendants of migrants from Panay and Negros in the Visayas who settled in the municipalities/towns of Norala, Banga, Surallah, Santo Niño and the province&#x27;s capital city, Koronadal, are the majority in the province. The province&#x27;s major media of communication are Hiligaynon, Tagalog, and English. On the other hand, Ilocano-speaking peoples of Luzon settled in Tampakan, Tantangan and Tupi, and the Ilocano language may still be heard in these towns. The Cebuanos are the main ethnic group of the municipality of Polomolok, and are one of the main ethnic groups of Tupi (along with the Hiligaynons, Ilocanos and Kapampangans). Both towns are near to General Santos, which speaks both Hiligaynon and Cebuano. Chavacano speakers are even found scattered in some areas of the province, as well as Maguindanaons because of the province&#x27;s history of being part of Sultanate of Maguindanao. Tbolis mainly reside around the Lake Sebu area, while Blaans reside within General Santos and its outskirts.

===Religion===

Roman Catholics predominate the province with 65% adherence, while Islam is a minority religion which is 6% of the population. Other minorities are various Christian Churches such as Prostestants which form about 22% and consist of mostly evangelicals of the province&#x27;s population which can be mostly found in some urban parts of the province. Iglesia ni Cristo forms about 3-4% population. The remainder are divided among Buddhist and animism.

The Maguindanaon make up the majority of the Muslim population in the province. Other indigenous Filipino tribes are the T&#x27;boli and B&#x27;laan tribes in Lake Sebu and T&#x27;boli municipalities, famous for their brassworks, beadwork and t&#x27;nalak weave. The people of these tribes wear colorful embroidered native costumes and beadwork accessories. The women of these tribes, particularly, wear heavy brass belts with brass &#x27;tassels&#x27; ending in tiny brass bells that herald their approach even when they are a long way off.

The people of South Cotabato retain many of the practices and traditions of their particular tribal heritages, although infused with a flavor that is distinctly Mindanaoan and the product of cultural interaction between the immigrants and the indigenous peoples of the area. One vivid example of this is the predominant use of the native &quot;malong&quot;, the colorful, tubelike garment used as a skirt by the indigenous tribes, in place of a blanket or sleeping bag.

===Language===
Hiligaynon is the most widely spoken language in the province. It is the main language in the capital city of Koronadal—earning its nickname &quot;the Ilonggo Capital of Mindanao&quot;—and the municipalities of the Upper Valley region, namely, Surallah, Banga, Norala, Sto. Niño and Tantangan, followed by Cebuano, which is the majority language of General Santos and the main language in the Municipalities of Polomolok, Tampakan and Tupi. Tagalog and English are widely understood and often used for administrative functions by the local government and in education, with the former serving as dominant language in local media and of everyday communication of speakers of different languages, making it a secondary lingua franca in the province. Other languages spoken in the province are Maguindanaon, Tboli, Blaan, Kapampangan and Ilocano.

<text>Espiritu Santo (, ; ) is the largest island in the nation of Vanuatu, with an area of and a population of around 40,000 according to the 2009 census.

==Geography==
The island belongs to the archipelago of the New Hebrides in the Pacific region of Melanesia. It is in the Sanma Province of Vanuatu. The town of Luganville, on Espiritu Santo&#x27;s southeast coast, is Vanuatu&#x27;s second-largest settlement and the provincial capital. Roads run north and west from Luganville, but most of the island is far from the limited road network. Around Espiritu Santo lie a number of small islands and islets; among them are: Dany Island, Araki, Elephant Island, Sakao, Lataroa, Lataro, Thion, Malohu, Malwepe, Malvapevu, Malparavu, Maltinerava, Oyster Island, Tangoa, and Bokissa.

Vanuatu&#x27;s highest peak is the Mount Tabwemasana in west-central Espiritu Santo.

==History==

A Spanish expedition of three ships, led by Portuguese explorer Pedro Fernandes de Queirós, landed in 1606 at Big Bay on the north side of the island. Queirós named the land &quot;La del Espíritu Santo&quot; in acknowledgment of the Spanish king&#x27;s descent from the royal House of Austria, and believing he had arrived in the Great Southern Continent, Terra Australis. They entered the bay on 1 and 2 May: the latter being the day of Saints Philip and James, Queirós named it .

The local chief tried to chase the Spanish explorers back to their ships, which led to an exchange of arrows and musket-fire, in which the chief was killed. The ships remained for a month at their anchorage &quot;&quot;, with armed sailors making incursions inland for provisions. Queirós announced his intention to found a city, Nova Jerusalem, and appointed municipal officers. In early June, with provisions running low, they left the bay to explore the neighbouring coastline. Queirós&#x27; lead ship became separated, and, whether through adverse weather or mutiny, was unable to make anchor in the bay.

The (second-in-command, and captain of the second ship), Luis Váez de Torres, searched the coast for signs of shipwreck but found none. He remained until late June, then sailed to the west coast with the intention of circumnavigating what he considered to be an island, not a continent. The wind and current were against this aim, so he left the island sailing west, eventually encountering the previously unexplored southern coast of New Guinea. Torres then discovered the strait that bears his name between northern Australia and southern New Guinea.

After the departure of Queirós and Torres, the Espiritu Santo was not visited again by Europeans until 160 years later, by Louis de Bougainville in 1768 and James Cook in 1774.

During the time of the British–French Condominium, Hog Harbour, on the northeast coast, was the site of the British district administration, while Segond, near Luganville, was the French district administration.

=== World War II ===

During World War II, particularly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the island was used by American naval and air forces as a large military supply and support base, naval harbor, and airfield. Luganville Airfield, also called Bomber Field #3, was a large airfield built by the Seabees of the 40th Naval Construction Battalion in 1943. Also built on the island was Bomber Field No.2 which became Santo-Pekoa International Airport after the war. Palikulo Bay Airfield, also called Bomber Field #1, became part of the main road after the war. Luganville Seaplane Base served the seaplane and Turtle Bay Airfield also called Fighter Field #1 served the fighter planes.

The SS &quot;President Coolidge&quot; was a converted luxury liner that hit a sea mine during the war and was sunk. The shipwreck off Espiritu Santo later became a popular diving spot. 
The presence of the Americans contributed later to the island&#x27;s tourism in scuba diving, as the Americans dumped most of their used military and naval equipment, and their refuse, at what is now known as &quot;Million Dollar Point&quot;.

In highly fictionalized form, this was the location of James Michener&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the South Pacific&quot;, and of the following Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, &quot;South Pacific&quot;.

=== Post–World War II ===
Between May and August 1980 the island was the site of a rebellion during the transfer of power over the colonial New Hebrides from the condominium to the independent Vanuatu. Jimmy Stevens&#x27; Nagriamel movement, in alliance with private French interests and backed by the Phoenix Foundation and American libertarians hoping to establish a tax-free haven, declared the island of Espiritu Santo to be independent of the new government. The &quot;Republic of Vemerana&quot; was proclaimed on May 28. France recognized the independence on June 3. On June 5, the tribal chiefs of Santo named the French Ambassador Philippe Allonneau the &quot;King of Vemerana&quot;, and Jimmy Stevens became the Prime Minister. 
Luganville was renamed Allonneaupolis. Next, negotiations with Port-Vila failed, and from July 27 to August 18, British Royal Marines and a unit of the French &quot;Garde Mobile&quot; were deployed to Vanuatu&#x27;s capital island, but they did not enter Espiritu Santo as the soon-to-be government had hoped. The troops were recalled shortly before independence. Following independence on 31 July 1980, Vanuatu, now governed by the Vanuaku Party with Father Walter Lini as Prime Minister, requested assistance from Papua New Guinea, whose army suppressed the rebellion, keeping Espiritu Santo in Vanuatu.

==Culture==

Over 30 different local languages are spoken on Espiritu Santo, a subgroup of the North Vanuatu languages. 

Espiritu Santo, with many wrecks and reefs to be explored, is a very popular tourist destination for divers. Champagne Beach draws tourists with its white sand and clear waters. The &quot;Western Side&quot; of the island contains many caves which can be explored, and cruise ships often stop in at Luganville.

The local people make their living by supporting the tourist trade, by cash-crop farming, mostly copra, but also some cocoa beans and kava, as well as peanuts, or by subsistence farming and fishing.

Most of the people are Christians. The largest church groups on the island are the Presbyterian Church of Vanuatu, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Church of Melanesia (Anglican). Also active are the Apostolic Church, the Church of Christ, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and others. However, in many villages, particularly in Big Bay and South Santo, the people are &quot;heathen&quot;, a term that in Vanuatu has no pejorative connotation — it simply denotes someone who has not embraced Christianity. Customary beliefs of a more modern sort are found among followers of the Nagriamel movement based in Fanafo.

For almost all of Espiritu Santo&#x27;s people, custom plays a large part in their lives, regardless of their religion. The chief system continues strongly in most areas.

The people of Santo face some health problems, especially malaria and tuberculosis. Although there is a hospital, most local people consult either their own witch doctor or medical clinics set up by Western missionaries. Kava is the popular drug of the island, although alcohol is becoming more prevalent. With the rising number of adults using alcohol, there is a rising crime rate, especially involving violence toward women, and tribal warfare.

===Sports===
In September 1998, Espiritu Santo hosted the Melanesia Cup soccer tournament.

==Economy and infrastructure==
Luganville is the only true town on the island; the rest of the island is dotted with small villages. From Luganville, three &quot;main roads&quot; emerge. Main Street leaves the town to the west and winds along the south coast of the island for about ending at the village of Tasiriki on the southwest coast. Canal Road runs along the southern and eastern coasts of the island, north through Hog Harbor and Golden Beach, ending at Port Olry. Big Bay Highway splits off from Canal Road near Turtle Bay on the east coast, runs generally west to the mountains, and then it leads north to Big Bay. The international airport is about east of the center of Luganville. Numerous rivers run to the coastline from the mountains of the island. The Sarakata River is the largest one, and it runs through Luganville.

Many people on Espiritu Santo still rely on subsistence farming for their food. The villages on the island are mostly self-sufficient with their own vegetable gardens, chickens, and pigs. Taros and yams are commonly grown in these gardens, and these are mainstays of the local diet. Velit Bay Plantation caters to tourists.

Espiritu Santo is home to a number of cattle farms (including the famous Belmol Cattle Project, originally established by French settlers), and the island exports much of its beef to Japan, Australia, and other Pacific countries. 

Besides beef, tinned fish, and rice bought in town, Espiritu Santo has many foods that locals take for granted, and that tourists enjoy as delicacies. Among these are sweet pineapples, mangoes, island cabbage, flying foxes, and coconut crab, as well as local nuts such as natapoa and the sweet fleshy-fruit called &quot;naos&quot; in Bislama, or great hog plum in English (a type of &quot;Spondias dulcis&quot;). There is a market in Luganville where local food such as yams, sweet potatoes, manioc, taro, cabbage, and other freshly grown island staples are sold. Some local handicrafts are also sold there. Several small supermarkets such as LCM, Unity Shell, and Au bon Marché sell groceries and many packaged goods.

==Biodiversity==
The island of Espiritu Santo is home to all of Vanuatu&#x27;s endemic birds, including the Santo mountain starling, a species restricted entirely to Espiritu Santo. Two protected areas have been established to safeguard the island&#x27;s biodiversity; the Loru Conservation Area on the east coast and the Vatthe Conservation area near Big Bay in the north.

The Loru Rainforest Protected Area is situated in the lowland rainforests of Espiritu Santo. Established in 1993 by Chief Caleb Ser, the reserve supports a rich variety of Vanuatu&#x27;s bird, bat, and plant life, as well as a diverse range of marine species in the stretch of fringing reef.

The tree &quot;Metrosideros tabwemasanaensis&quot; is endemic to high mountain forests on Mount Tabwemasana.

<text>The following lists events that happened during [[1951]] in [[Afghanistan]].

As in the previous year, relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan are not happy, because of charges and countercharges regarding border incidents and, on the Pakistan side, particularly because of the alleged encouragement by Afghanistan of the Pashtunistan movement.

==Incumbents==
* Monarch – Mohammed Zahir Shah
* Prime Minister – Shah Mahmud Khan

==January 1951==
A visit of the Afghan prime minister, Shah Mahmud Khan, to New Delhi gives an indication of the cordial relationship maintained with India. Shah Mahmud is entertained by the government of India and a tribute to Indo-Afghan relations is paid by Chhakravarthi Rajagopalachari, Indian home minister.

==February 1951==
Under the Point Four program, an agreement with the United States is signed in Kabul to assist the Afghan government in the economic development of the country.

==September 5, 1951==
The Afghan prime minister, who is paying yet another visit to Delhi, is invited to address members of the Indian parliament, and he reaffirms his hope that the close and sincere relations already existing between Afghanistan and India will remain for the benefit of world peace. At a press conference Shah Mahmud Khan stresses the friendliness of Afghan policy toward Pakistan, and maintains that in supporting the &quot;Pashtunistan&quot; movement Afghanistan is not animated by hostility to Pakistan.

==October 16, 1951==
Liaquat Ali Khan, prime minister of Pakistan, is assassinated, calling forth from Kabul a sympathetic message and a tribute to his ability. The Pakistan government on its side is careful to stress the point that, although the assassin is stated to be of Afghan origin, there is no sinister significance in that fact, especially as he has been an exile in Pakistan for some time.

<doc id="297382" wikidata="Q550479" url="?curid=297382" title="Quantitative genetics">
<text>Quantitative genetics is the study of quantitative traits, which are phenotypes that vary continuously—such as height or mass—as opposed to phenotypes and gene-products that are discretely identifiable—such as eye-colour, or the presence of a particular biochemical.

Both of these branches of genetics use the frequencies of different alleles of a gene in breeding populations (gamodemes), and combine them with concepts from simple Mendelian inheritance to analyze inheritance patterns across generations and descendant lines. While population genetics can focus on particular genes and their subsequent metabolic products, quantitative genetics focuses more on the outward phenotypes, and makes only summaries of the underlying genetics.

Due to the continuous distribution of phenotypic values, quantitative genetics must employ many other statistical methods (such as the &quot;effect size&quot;, the &quot;mean&quot; and the &quot;variance&quot;) to link phenotypes (attributes) to genotypes. Some phenotypes may be analyzed either as discrete categories or as continuous phenotypes, depending on the definition of cut-off points, or on the &quot;metric&quot; used to quantify them. Mendel himself had to discuss this matter in his famous paper, especially with respect to his peas&#x27; attribute &quot;tall/dwarf&quot;, which actually was derived by adding a cut-off point to &quot;length of stem&quot;. Analysis of quantitative trait loci, or QTLs, is a more recent addition to quantitative genetics, linking it more directly to molecular genetics.

==Gene effects==

In diploid organisms, the average genotypic &quot;value&quot; (locus value) may be defined by the allele &quot;effect&quot; together with a dominance effect, and also by how genes interact with genes at other loci (epistasis). The founder of quantitative genetics - Sir Ronald Fisher - perceived much of this when he proposed the first mathematics of this branch of genetics.
Being a statistician, he defined the gene effects as deviations from a central value—enabling the use of statistical concepts such as mean and variance, which use this idea. The central value he chose for the gene was the midpoint between the two opposing homozygotes at the one locus. The deviation from there to the &quot;greater&quot; homozygous genotype can be named &quot;&quot;+a&quot;; and therefore it is &quot;-a&quot;&quot; from that same midpoint to the &quot;lesser&quot; homozygote genotype. This is the &quot;allele&quot; effect mentioned above. The heterozygote deviation from the same midpoint can be named &quot;d&quot;, this being the &quot;dominance&quot; effect referred to above. The diagram depicts the idea. However, in reality we measure phenotypes, and the figure also shows how observed phenotypes relate to the gene effects. Formal definitions of these effects recognize this phenotypic focus. Epistasis has been approached statistically as interaction (i.e., inconsistencies), but &quot;epigenetics&quot; suggests a new approach may be needed.

If 0&lt;d&lt;a, the dominance is regarded as &quot;partial&quot; or &quot;incomplete&quot;—while d=a indicates full or &quot;classical&quot; dominance. Previously, d&gt;a was known as &quot;over-dominance&quot;.

Mendel&#x27;s pea attribute &quot;length of stem&quot; provides us with a good example. Mendel stated that the tall true-breeding parents ranged from 6–7 feet in stem length (183 – 213 cm), giving a median of 198 cm (= P1). The short parents ranged from 0.75 to 1.25 feet in stem length (23 – 46 cm), with a rounded median of 34 cm (= P2). Their hybrid ranged from 6–7.5 feet in length (183–229 cm), with a median of 206 cm (= F1). The mean of P1 and P2 is 116 cm, this being the phenotypic value of the homozygotes midpoint (mp). The allele affect (&quot;a&quot;) is [P1-mp] = 82 cm = -[P2-mp]. The dominance effect (&quot;d&quot;) is [F1-mp] = 90 cm. This historical example illustrates clearly how phenotype values and gene effects are linked.

==Allele and genotype frequencies==

To obtain means, variances and other statistics, both &quot;quantities&quot; and their &quot;occurrences&quot; are required. The gene effects (above) provide the framework for &quot;quantities&quot;: and the &quot;frequencies&quot; of the contrasting alleles in the fertilization gamete-pool provide the information on &quot;occurrences&quot;. Commonly, the frequency of the allele causing &quot;more&quot; in the phenotype (including dominance) is given the symbol p, while the frequency of the contrasting allele is q. An initial assumption made when establishing the algebra was that the parental population was infinite and random mating, which was made simply to facilitate the derivation. The subsequent mathematical development also implied that the frequency distribution within the effective gamete-pool was uniform: there were no local perturbations where p and q varied. Looking at the diagrammatic analysis of sexual reproduction, this is the same as declaring that pP = pg = p; and similarly for q. This mating system, dependent upon these assumptions, became known as &quot;panmixia&quot;.

Panmixia rarely actually occurs in nature, as gamete distribution may be limited, for example by dispersal restrictions or by behaviour, or by chance sampling (those local perturbations mentioned above). It is well known that there is a huge wastage of gametes in Nature, which is why the diagram depicts a &quot;potential&quot; gamete-pool separately to the &quot;actual&quot; gamete-pool. Only the latter sets the definitive frequencies for the zygotes: this is the true &quot;gamodeme&quot; (&quot;gamo&quot; refers to the gametes, and &quot;deme&quot; derives from Greek for &quot;population&quot;). But, under Fisher&#x27;s assumptions, the &quot;gamodeme&quot; can be effectively extended back to the &quot;potential&quot; gamete-pool, and even back to the parental base-population (the &quot;source&quot; population). The random sampling arising when small &quot;actual&quot; gamete-pools are sampled from a large &quot;potential&quot; gamete-pool is known as &quot;genetic drift&quot;, and is considered subsequently.

While panmixia may not be widely extant, the &quot;potential&quot; for it does occur, although it may be only ephemeral because of those local perturbations. It has been shown, for example, that the F2 derived from &quot;random fertilization of F1 individuals&quot; (an &quot;allogamous&quot; F2), following hybridization, is an &quot;origin&quot; of a new &quot;potentially&quot; panmictic population. It has also been shown that if panmictic random fertilization occurred continually, it would maintain the same allele and genotype frequencies across each successive panmictic sexual generation—this being the &quot;Hardy Weinberg&quot; equilibrium. However, as soon as genetic drift was initiated by local random sampling of gametes, the equilibrium would cease.

=== Random fertilization===

Male and female gametes within the actual fertilizing pool are considered usually to have the same frequencies for their corresponding alleles. (Exceptions have been considered.) This means that when p male gametes carrying the A allele randomly fertilize p female gametes carrying that same allele, the resulting zygote has genotype AA, and, under random fertilization, the combination occurs with a frequency of p x p (= p2). Similarly, the zygote aa occurs with a frequency of q2. Heterozygotes (Aa) can arise in two ways: when p male (A allele) randomly fertilize q female (a allele) gametes, and &quot;vice versa&quot;. The resulting frequency for the heterozygous zygotes is thus 2pq. Notice that such a population is never more than half heterozygous, this maximum occurring when p=q= 0.5.

In summary then, under random fertilization, the zygote (genotype) frequencies are the quadratic expansion of the gametic (allelic) frequencies: formula_1. (The &quot;=1&quot; states that the frequencies are in fraction form, not percentages; and that there are no omissions within the framework proposed.)

Notice that &quot;random fertilization&quot; and &quot;panmixia&quot; are &quot;not&quot; synonyms.

=== Mendel&#x27;s research cross – a contrast===

Mendel&#x27;s pea experiments were constructed by establishing true-breeding parents with &quot;opposite&quot; phenotypes for each attribute. This meant that each opposite parent was homozygous for its respective allele only. In our example, &quot;tall &quot;vs&quot; dwarf&quot;, the tall parent would be genotype TT with p = 1 (and q = 0); while the dwarf parent would be genotype tt with q = 1 (and p = 0). After controlled crossing, their hybrid is Tt, with p = q = &#x27;. However, the frequency of this heterozygote = 1, because this is the F1 of an artificial cross: it has not arisen through random fertilization. The F2 generation was produced by natural self-pollination of the F1 (with monitoring against insect contamination), resulting in p = q = &#x27; being maintained. Such an F2 is said to be &quot;autogamous&quot;. However, the genotype frequencies (0.25 TT, 0.5 Tt, 0.25 tt) have arisen through a mating system very different from random fertilization, and therefore the use of the quadratic expansion has been avoided. The numerical values obtained were the same as those for random fertilization only because this is the special case of having originally crossed homozygous opposite parents. We can notice that, because of the dominance of T- [frequency (0.25 + 0.5)] over tt [frequency 0.25], the 3:1 ratio is still obtained.

A cross such as Mendel&#x27;s, where true-breeding (largely homozygous) opposite parents are crossed in a controlled way to produce an F1, is a special case of hybrid structure. The F1 is often regarded as &quot;entirely heterozygous&quot; for the gene under consideration. However, this is an over-simplification and does not apply generally—for example when individual parents are not homozygous, or when &quot;populations&quot; inter-hybridise to form &quot;hybrid swarms&quot;. The general properties of intra-species hybrids (F1) and F2 (both &quot;autogamous&quot; and &quot;allogamous&quot;) are considered in a later section.

=== Self fertilization – an alternative===

Having noticed that the pea is naturally self-pollinated, we cannot continue to use it as an example for illustrating random fertilization properties. Self-fertilization (&quot;selfing&quot;) is a major alternative to random fertilization, especially within Plants. Most of the Earth&#x27;s cereals are naturally self-pollinated (rice, wheat, barley, for example), as well as the pulses. Considering the millions of individuals of each of these on Earth at any time, it is obvious that self-fertilization is at least as significant as random fertilization. Self-fertilization is the most intensive form of &quot;inbreeding&quot;, which arises whenever there is restricted independence in the genetical origins of gametes. Such reduction in independence arises if parents are already related, and/or from genetic drift or other spatial restrictions on gamete dispersal. Path analysis demonstrates that these are tantamount to the same thing. Arising from this background, the &quot;inbreeding coefficient&quot; (often symbolized as F or f) quantifies the effect of inbreeding from whatever cause. There are several formal definitions of f, and some of these are considered in later sections. For the present, note that for a long-term self-fertilized species f = 1.
Natural self-fertilized populations are not single &quot; &quot;pure lines&quot; &quot;, however, but mixtures of such lines. This becomes particularly obvious when considering more than one gene at a time. Therefore, allele frequencies (p and q) other than 1 or 0 are still relevant in these cases (refer back to the Mendel Cross section). The genotype frequencies take a different form, however.
In general, the genotype frequencies become formula_2 for AA and formula_3 for Aa and formula_4 for aa.

Notice that the frequency of the heterozygote declines in proportion to f. When &quot;f&quot; = 1, these three frequencies become respectively p, 0 and q Conversely, when f = 0, they reduce to the random-fertilization quadratic expansion shown previously.

===Population mean===
The population mean shifts the central reference point from the homozygote midpoint (mp) to the mean of a sexually reproduced population. This is important not only to relocate the focus into the natural world, but also to use a measure of &quot;central tendency&quot; used by Statistics/Biometrics. In particular, the square of this mean is the Correction Factor, which is used to obtain the genotypic variances later. 

For each genotype in turn, its allele effect is multiplied by its genotype frequency; and the products are accumulated across all genotypes in the model. Some algebraic simplification usually follows to reach a succinct result.

==== The mean after random fertilization====
The contribution of AA is formula_5, that of Aa is formula_6, and that of aa is formula_7. Gathering together the two a terms and accumulating over all, the result is: formula_8. Simplification is achieved by noting that formula_9, and by recalling that formula_10, thereby reducing the right-hand term to formula_11.

The succinct result is therefore formula_12. 

This defines the population mean as an &quot;offset&quot; from the homozygote midpoint (recall a and d are defined as &quot;deviations&quot; from that midpoint). The Figure depicts G across all values of p for several values of d, including one case of slight over-dominance. Notice that G is often negative, thereby emphasizing that it is itself a &quot;deviation&quot; (from mp).

Finally, to obtain the &quot;actual&quot; Population Mean in &quot;phenotypic space&quot;, the midpoint value is added to this offset: formula_13.

An example arises from data on ear length in maize. Assuming for now that one gene only is represented, a = 5.45 cm, d = 0.12 cm [virtually &quot;0&quot;, really], mp = 12.05 cm. Further assuming that p = 0.6 and q = 0.4 in this example population, then:

G = 5.45 (0.6 − 0.4) + (0.48)0.12 = 1.15 cm (rounded); and

P = 1.15 + 12.05 = 13.20 cm (rounded).

==== The mean after long-term self-fertilization====
The contribution of AA is formula_14, while that of aa is formula_15. [See above for the frequencies.] Gathering these two a terms together leads to an immediately very simple final result:

formula_16. As before, formula_13.

Often, &quot;G(f=1)&quot; is abbreviated to &quot;G1&quot;.

Mendel&#x27;s peas can provide us with the allele effects and midpoint (see previously); and a mixed self-pollinated population with p = 0.6 and q = 0.4 provides example frequencies. Thus:

G(f=1) = 82 (0.6 − .04) = 59.6 cm (rounded); and

P(f=1) = 59.6 + 116 = 175.6 cm (rounded).

==== The mean – generalized fertilization====
A general formula incorporates the inbreeding coefficient f, and can then accommodate any situation. The procedure is exactly the same as before, using the weighted genotype frequencies given earlier. After translation into our symbols, and further rearrangement: 

formula_18
Here, G0 is G, which was given earlier. (Often, when dealing with inbreeding, &quot;G0&quot; is preferred to &quot;G&quot;.)

Supposing that the maize example [given earlier] had been constrained on a holme (a narrow riparian meadow), and had partial inbreeding to the extent of f = 0.25, then, using the third version (above) of Gf:

G&quot;0.25&quot; = 1.15 − 0.25 (0.48) 0.12 = 1.136 cm (rounded), with P0.25 = 13.194 cm (rounded).

There is hardly any effect from inbreeding in this example, which arises because there was virtually no dominance in this attribute (d → 0). Examination of all three versions of G&quot;f&quot; reveals that this would lead to trivial change in the Population mean. Where dominance was notable, however, there would be considerable change.

===Genetic drift===
Genetic drift was introduced when discussing the likelihood of panmixia being widely extant as a natural fertilization pattern. [See section on Allele and Genotype frequencies.] Here the sampling of gametes from the &quot;potential&quot; gamodeme is discussed in more detail. The sampling involves random fertilization between pairs of random gametes, each of which may contain either an A or an a allele. The sampling is therefore binomial sampling. Each sampling &quot;packet&quot; involves 2N alleles, and produces N zygotes (a &quot;progeny&quot; or a &quot;line&quot;) as a result. During the course of the reproductive period, this sampling is repeated over and over, so that the final result is a mixture of sample progenies. The result is &quot;dispersed random fertilization&quot; formula_19 These events, and the overall end-result, are examined here with an illustrative example.

The &quot;base&quot; allele frequencies of the example are those of the &quot;potential gamodeme&quot;: the frequency of A is pg = 0.75, while the frequency of a is qg = 0.25. [&quot;White label&quot; &quot;1&quot; in the diagram.] Five example actual gamodemes are binomially sampled out of this base (s = the number of samples = 5), and each sample is designated with an &quot;index&quot; k: with k = 1 ... s sequentially. (These are the sampling &quot;packets&quot; referred to in the previous paragraph.) The number of gametes involved in fertilization varies from sample to sample, and is given as 2Nk [at &quot;white label&quot; &quot;2&quot; in the diagram]. The total (Σ) number of gametes sampled overall is 52 [&quot;white label&quot; &quot;3&quot; in the diagram]. Because each sample has its own size, &quot;weights&quot; are needed to obtain averages (and other statistics) when obtaining the overall results. These are formula_20, and are given at &quot;white label&quot; &quot;4&quot; in the diagram.
==== The sample gamodemes – genetic drift====
Following completion of these five binomial sampling events, the resultant actual gamodemes each contained different allele frequencies—(pk and qk). [These are given at &quot;white label&quot; &quot;5&quot; in the diagram.] This outcome is actually the genetic drift itself. Notice that two samples (k = 1 and 5) happen to have the same frequencies as the &quot;base&quot; (&quot;potential&quot;) gamodeme. Another (k = 3) happens to have the &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; &quot;reversed&quot;. Sample (k = 2) happens to be an &quot;extreme&quot; case, with pk = 0.9 and qk = 0.1; while the remaining sample (k = 4) is &quot;middle of the range&quot; in its allele frequencies. All of these results have arisen only by &quot;chance&quot;, through binomial sampling. Having occurred, however, they set in place all the downstream properties of the progenies.

Because sampling involves chance, the &quot;probabilities&quot; ( k ) of obtaining each of these samples become of interest. These binomial probabilities depend on the starting frequencies (pg and qg) and the sample size (2Nk). They are tedious to obtain, but are of considerable interest. [See &quot;white label&quot; &quot;6&quot; in the diagram.] The two samples (k = 1, 5), with the allele frequencies the same as in the &quot;potential gamodeme&quot;, had higher &quot;chances&quot; of occurring than the other samples. Their binomial probabilities did differ, however, because of their different sample sizes (2Nk). The &quot;reversal&quot; sample (k = 3) had a very low Probability of occurring, confirming perhaps what might be expected. The &quot;extreme&quot; allele frequency gamodeme (k = 2) was not &quot;rare&quot;, however; and the &quot;middle of the range&quot; sample (k=4) &quot;was&quot; rare. These same Probabilities apply also to the progeny of these fertilizations.
Here, some &quot;summarizing&quot; can begin. The &quot;overall allele frequencies&quot; in the progenies bulk are supplied by weighted averages of the appropriate frequencies of the individual samples. That is: formula_21 and formula_22. (Notice that k is replaced by • for the overall result—a common practice.) The results for the example are p• = 0.631 and q• = 0.369 [&quot;black label&quot; &quot;5&quot; in the diagram]. These values are quite different to the starting ones (pg and qg) [&quot;white label&quot; &quot;1&quot;]. The sample allele frequencies also have variance as well as an average. This has been obtained using the &quot;sum of squares (SS)&quot; method [See to the right of &quot;black label&quot; &quot;5&quot; in the diagram]. [Further discussion on this variance occurs in the section below on Extensive genetic drift.]

==== The progeny lines – dispersion====
The &quot;genotype frequencies&quot; of the five sample progenies are obtained from the usual quadratic expansion of their respective allele frequencies (&quot;random fertilization&quot;). The results are given at the diagram&#x27;s &quot;white label&quot; &quot;7&quot; for the homozygotes, and at &quot;white label&quot; &quot;8&quot; for the heterozygotes. Re-arrangement in this manner prepares the way for monitoring inbreeding levels. This can be done either by examining the level of &quot;total&quot; homozygosis [(p2k + q2k) = (1 − 2pkqk)], or by examining the level of heterozygosis (2pkqk), as they are complementary. Notice that samples &quot;k= 1, 3, 5&quot; all had the same level of heterozygosis, despite one being the &quot;mirror image&quot; of the others with respect to allele frequencies. The &quot;extreme&quot; allele-frequency case (k= &quot;2&quot;) had the most homozygosis (least heterozygosis) of any sample. The &quot;middle of the range&quot; case (k= &quot;4&quot;) had the least homozygosity (most heterozygosity): they were each equal at 0.50, in fact.

The &quot;overall summary&quot; can continue by obtaining the &quot;weighted average&quot; of the respective genotype frequencies for the progeny bulk. Thus, for AA, it is formula_23, for Aa, it is formula_24 and for aa, it is formula_25. The example results are given at &quot;black label&quot; &quot;7&quot; for the homozygotes, and at &quot;black label&quot; &quot;8&quot; for the heterozygote. Note that the heterozygosity mean is &quot;0.3588&quot;, which the next section uses to examine inbreeding resulting from this genetic drift.

The next focus of interest is the dispersion itself, which refers to the &quot;spreading apart&quot; of the progenies&#x27; &quot;population means&quot;. These are obtained as formula_26 [see section on the Population mean], for each sample progeny in turn, using the example gene effects given at &quot;white label&quot; &quot;9&quot; in the diagram. Then, each formula_27 is obtained also [at &quot;white label&quot; &quot;10&quot; in the diagram]. Notice that the &quot;best&quot; line (k = 2) had the &quot;highest&quot; allele frequency for the &quot;more&quot; allele (A) (it also had the highest level of homozygosity). The &quot;worst&quot; progeny (k = 3) had the highest frequency for the &quot;less&quot; allele (a), which accounted for its poor performance. This &quot;poor&quot; line was less homozygous than the &quot;best&quot; line; and it shared the same level of homozygosity, in fact, as the two &quot;second-best&quot; lines (k = 1, 5). The progeny line with both the &quot;more&quot; and the &quot;less&quot; alleles present in equal frequency (k = 4) had a mean below the &quot;overall average&quot; (see next paragraph), and had the lowest level of homozygosity. These results reveal the fact that the alleles most prevalent in the &quot;gene-pool&quot; (also called the &quot;germplasm&quot;) determine performance, not the level of homozygosity per se. Binomial sampling alone effects this dispersion.

The &quot;overall summary&quot; can now be concluded by obtaining formula_28 and formula_29. The example result for P• is 36.94 (&quot;black label&quot; &quot;10&quot; in the diagram). This later is used to quantify &quot;inbreeding depression&quot; overall, from the gamete sampling. [See the next section.] However, recall that some &quot;non-depressed&quot; progeny means have been identified already (k = 1, 2, 5). This is an enigma of inbreeding—while there may be &quot;depression&quot; overall, there are usually superior lines among the gamodeme samplings.

==== The equivalent post-dispersion panmictic – inbreeding====
Included in the &quot;overall summary&quot; were the average allele frequencies in the mixture of progeny lines (p• and q•). These can now be used to construct a hypothetical panmictic equivalent. This can be regarded as a &quot;reference&quot; to assess the changes wrought by the gamete sampling. The example appends such a panmictic to the right of the Diagram. The frequency of AA is therefore (p•)2 = 0.3979. This is less than that found in the dispersed bulk (0.4513 at &quot;black label&quot; &quot;7&quot;). Similarly, for aa, (q•)2 = 0.1303—again less than the equivalent in the progenies bulk (0.1898). Clearly, &quot;genetic drift&quot; has increased the overall level of homozygosis by the amount (0.6411 − 0.5342) = 0.1069. In a complementary approach, the heterozygosity could be used instead. The panmictic equivalent for Aa is 2 p• q• = 0.4658, which is &quot;higher&quot; than that in the sampled bulk (0.3588) [&quot;black label&quot; &quot;8&quot;]. The sampling has caused the heterozygosity to decrease by 0.1070, which differs trivially from the earlier estimate because of rounding errors.

The inbreeding coefficient (f) was introduced in the early section on Self Fertilization. Here, a formal definition of it is considered: f is the probability that two &quot;same&quot; alleles (that is A and A, or a and a), which fertilize together are of common ancestral origin—or (more formally) f is the probability that two homologous alleles are autozygous. Consider any random gamete in the &quot;potential&quot; gamodeme that has its syngamy partner restricted by binomial sampling. The probability that that second gamete is homologous autozygous to the first is 1/(2N), the reciprocal of the gamodeme size. For the five example progenies, these quantities are 0.1, 0.0833, 0.1, 0.0833 and 0.125 respectively, and their weighted average is 0.0961. This is the &quot;inbreeding coefficient&quot; of the example progenies bulk, provided it is &quot;unbiased&quot; with respect to the full binomial distribution. An example based upon &quot;s = 5&quot; is likely to be biased, however, when compared to an appropriate entire binomial distribution based upon the sample number (&quot;s&quot;) approaching infinity (&quot;s → ∞&quot;). Another derived definition of f for the full Distribution is that f also equals the rise in homozygosity, which equals the fall in heterozygosity. For the example, these frequency changes are &quot;0.1069&quot; and &quot;0.1070&quot;, respectively. This result is different to the above, indicating that bias with respect to the full underlying distribution is present in the example. For the example &quot;itself&quot;, these latter values are the better ones to use, namely f• = 0.10695.

The &quot;population mean&quot; of the equivalent panmictic is found as &quot;[a (p•-q•) + 2 p•q• d] + mp&quot;. Using the example &quot;gene effects&quot; (&quot;white label&quot; &quot;9&quot; in the diagram), this mean is formula_30 37.87. The equivalent mean in the dispersed bulk is 36.94 (&quot;black label&quot; &quot;10&quot;), which is depressed by the amount &quot;0.93&quot;. This is the &quot;inbreeding depression&quot; from this Genetic Drift. However, as noted previously, three progenies were &quot;not&quot; depressed (k = 1, 2, 5), and had means even greater than that of the panmictic equivalent. These are the lines a plant breeder looks for in a line selection programme.

==== Extensive binomial sampling – is panmixia restored?====
If the number of binomial samples is large (s → ∞ ), then p• → pg and q• → qg. It might be queried whether panmixia would effectively re-appear under these circumstances. However, the sampling of allele frequencies has &quot;still occurred&quot;, with the result that σ2p, q ≠ 0. In fact, as s → ∞, the formula_31, which is the &quot;variance&quot; of the &quot;whole binomial distribution&quot;. Furthermore, the &quot;Wahlund equations&quot; show that the progeny-bulk &quot;homozygote&quot; frequencies can be obtained as the sums of their respective average values (p2• or q2•) &quot;plus&quot; σ2p, q. Likewise, the bulk &quot;heterozygote&quot; frequency is (2 p• q•) &quot;minus&quot; twice the σ2p, q. The variance arising from the binomial sampling is conspicuously present. Thus, even when s → ∞, the progeny-bulk &quot;genotype&quot; frequencies still reveal &quot;increased homozygosis&quot;, and &quot;decreased heterozygosis&quot;, there is still &quot;dispersion of progeny means&quot;, and still &quot;inbreeding&quot; and &quot;inbreeding depression&quot;. That is, panmixia is &quot;not&quot; re-attained once lost because of genetic drift (binomial sampling). However, a new &quot;potential&quot; panmixia can be initiated via an allogamous F2 following hybridization.

==== Continued genetic drift – increased dispersion and inbreeding====
Previous discussion on genetic drift examined just one cycle (generation) of the process. When the sampling continues over successive generations, conspicuous changes occur in σ2p, q and f. Furthermore, another &quot;index&quot; is needed to keep track of &quot;time&quot;: t = 1 ... y where y = the number of &quot;years&quot; (generations) considered. The methodology often is to add the current binomial increment (Δ = &quot;de novo&quot;) to what has occurred previously. The entire Binomial Distribution is examined here. [There is no further benefit to be had from an abbreviated example.]

===== Dispersion via σ2p,q=====
Earlier this variance (σ 2p,q) was seen to be:-
formula_32

With the extension over time, this is also the result of the &quot;first&quot; cycle, and so is formula_33 (for brevity). At cycle 2, this variance is generated yet again—this time becoming the &quot;de novo&quot; variance (formula_34)—and accumulates to what was present already—the &quot;carry-over&quot; variance. The &quot;second&quot; cycle variance (formula_35) is the weighted sum of these two components, the weights being formula_36 for the &quot;de novo&quot; and formula_37 = formula_38 for the&quot;carry-over&quot;. 
Thus, 

The extension to generalize to any time &quot;t&quot;, after considerable simplification, becomes:- 
Because it was this variation in allele frequencies that caused the &quot;spreading apart&quot; of the progenies&#x27; means (&quot;dispersion&quot;), the change in σ2t over the generations indicates the change in the level of the &quot;dispersion&quot;.

=====Dispersion via &quot;f&quot;=====
The method for examining the inbreeding coefficient is similar to that used for &quot;σ 2p,q&quot;. The same weights as before are used respectively for &quot;de novo f&quot; ( Δ f ) [recall this is 1/(2N) ] and &quot;carry-over f&quot;. Therefore, formula_39 , which is similar to Equation (1) in the previous sub-section. 
In general, after rearrangement, formula_40 The graphs to the left show levels of inbreeding over twenty generations arising from genetic drift for various &quot;actual gamodeme&quot; sizes (2N).

Still further rearrangements of this general equation reveal some interesting relationships.
(A) After some simplification, formula_41. The left-hand side is the difference between the current and previous levels of inbreeding: the &quot;change in inbreeding&quot; (δft). Notice, that this &quot;change in inbreeding&quot; (δft) is equal to the &quot;de novo inbreeding&quot; (Δf) only for the first cycle—when ft-1 is &quot;zero&quot;.

(B) An item of note is the (1-ft-1), which is an &quot;index of &quot;non-inbreeding&quot;&quot;. It is known as the &quot;panmictic index&quot;. formula_42.

(C) Further useful relationships emerge involving the &quot;panmictic index&quot;.
formula_43.
(D) A key link emerges between &quot;σ 2p,q&quot; and &quot;f&quot;. Firstly...
formula_44
Secondly, presuming that f0 = 0, the right-hand side of this equation reduces to the section within the brackets of Equation (2) at the end of the last sub-section. That is, if initially there is no inbreeding, formula_45 ! Furthermore, if this then is rearranged, formula_46. That is, when initial inbreeding is zero, the two principal viewpoints of &quot;binomial gamete sampling&quot; (genetic drift) are directly inter-convertible.

==== Selfing within random fertilization====

It is easy to overlook that &quot;random fertilization&quot; includes self-fertilization. Sewall Wright showed that a proportion 1/N of &quot;random fertilizations&quot; is actually &quot;self fertilization&quot; formula_47, with the remainder (N-1)/N being &quot;cross fertilization&quot; formula_48. Following path analysis and simplification, the new view &quot;random fertilization inbreeding&quot; was found to be: formula_49. Upon further rearrangement, the earlier results from the binomial sampling were confirmed, along with some new arrangements. Two of these were potentially very useful, namely: (A) formula_50; and (B) formula_51.

The recognition that selfing may &quot;intrinsically be a part of&quot; random fertilization leads to some issues about the use of the previous &quot;random fertilization&quot; &#x27;inbreeding coefficient&#x27;. Clearly, then, it is inappropriate for any species incapable of &quot;self fertilization&quot;, which includes plants with self-incompatibility mechanisms, dioecious plants, and bisexual animals. The equation of Wright was modified later to provide a version of random fertilization that involved only &quot;cross fertilization&quot; with no &quot;self fertilization&quot;. The proportion 1/N formerly due to &quot;selfing&quot; now defined the &quot;carry-over&quot; gene-drift inbreeding arising from the previous cycle. The new version is:
formula_52.

The graphs to the right depict the differences between standard &quot;random fertilization&quot; RF, and random fertilization adjusted for &quot;cross fertilization alone&quot; CF. As can be seen, the issue is non-trivial for small gamodeme sample sizes.

Not only is &quot;panmixia&quot; &quot;not&quot; a synonym for &quot;random fertilization&quot;, but also that &quot;random fertilization&quot; is &quot;not&quot; a synonym for &quot;cross fertilization&quot;.

==== Homozygosity and heterozygosity====
In the sub-section on &quot;The sample gamodemes – Genetic drift&quot;, a series of gamete samplings was followed, an outcome of which was an increase in homozygosity at the expense of heterozygosity. From this viewpoint, the rise in homozygosity was due to the gamete samplings. Levels of homozygosity can be viewed also according to whether homozygotes arose allozygously or autozygously. Recall that autozygous alleles have the same allelic origin, the likelihood (frequency) of which is the inbreeding coefficient (&quot;f&quot;) by definition. The proportion arising &quot;allozygously&quot; is therefore (1-f). For the A-bearing gametes, which are present with a general frequency of p, the overall frequency of those that are autozygous is therefore (f &quot;p&quot;). Similarly, for a-bearing gametes, the autozygous frequency is (f &quot;q&quot;). These two viewpoints regarding genotype frequencies must be connected to establish consistency.

Following firstly the &quot;auto/allo&quot; viewpoint, consider the &quot;allozygous&quot; component. This occurs with the frequency of (1-f), and the alleles unite according to the &quot;random fertilization&quot; quadratic expansion. Thus: 
formula_53 Consider next the &quot;autozygous&quot; component. As these alleles are &quot;autozygous&quot;, they are effectively selfings, and produce either AA or aa genotypes, but no heterozygotes. They therefore produce formula_54 &quot;AA&quot; homozygotes plus formula_55 &quot;aa&quot; homozygotes. Adding these two components together results in:
formula_56 for the AA homozygote; formula_57 for the aa homozygote; and formula_58 for the Aa heterozygote. This is the same equation as that presented earlier in the section on &quot;Self fertilization – an alternative&quot;. The reason for the decline in heterozygosity is made clear here. Heterozygotes can arise only from the allozygous component, and its frequency in the sample bulk is just (1-f): hence this must also be the factor controlling the frequency of the heterozygotes.

Secondly, the &quot;sampling&quot; viewpoint is re-examined. Previously, it was noted that the decline in heterozygotes was formula_59. This decline is distributed equally towards each homozygote; and is added to their basic &quot;random fertilization&quot; expectations. Therefore, the genotype frequencies are: formula_60 for the &quot;AA&quot; homozygote; formula_61 for the &quot;aa&quot; homozygote; and formula_62 for the heterozygote.

Thirdly, the &quot;consistency&quot; between the two previous viewpoints needs establishing. It is apparent at once [from the corresponding equations above] that the heterozygote frequency is the same in both viewpoints. However, such a straightforward result is not immediately apparent for the homozygotes. Begin by considering the AA homozygote&#x27;s final equation in the &quot;auto/allo&quot; paragraph above:- formula_56. Expand the brackets, and follow by re-gathering [within the resultant] the two new terms with the common-factor &quot;f&quot; in them. The result is: formula_64. Next, for the parenthesized &quot; &quot;p20&quot; &quot;, a &quot;(1-q)&quot; is substituted for a &quot;p&quot;, the result becoming formula_65. Following that substitution, it is a straightforward matter of multiplying-out, simplifying and watching signs. The end result is formula_66, which is exactly the result for AA in the &quot;sampling&quot; paragraph. The two viewpoints are therefore &quot;consistent&quot; for the AA homozygote. In a like manner, the consistency of the aa viewpoints can also be shown. The two viewpoints are consistent for all classes of genotypes.

==Extended principles==
===Other fertilization patterns===
In previous sections, dispersive random fertilization (&quot;genetic drift&quot;) has been considered comprehensively, and self-fertilization and hybridizing have been examined to varying degrees. The diagram to the left depicts the first two of these, along with another &quot;spatially based&quot; pattern: &quot;islands&quot;. This is a pattern of &quot;random fertilization&quot; featuring &quot;dispersed gamodemes&quot;, with the addition of &quot;overlaps&quot; in which &quot;non-dispersive&quot; random fertilization occurs. With the &quot;islands&quot; pattern, individual gamodeme sizes (2N) are observable, and overlaps (m) are minimal. This is one of Sewall Wright&#x27;s array of possibilities. In addition to &quot;spatially&quot; based patterns of fertilization, there are others based on either &quot;phenotypic&quot; or &quot;relationship&quot; criteria. The &quot;phenotypic&quot; bases include &quot;assortative&quot; fertilization (between similar phenotypes) and &quot;disassortative&quot; fertilization (between opposite phenotypes). The &quot;relationship&quot; patterns include &quot;sib crossing&quot;, &quot;cousin crossing&quot; and &quot;backcrossing&quot;—and are considered in a separate section. &quot;Self fertilization&quot; may be considered both from a spatial or relationship point of view.

==== &quot;Islands&quot; random fertilization====
The breeding population consists of s small dispersed random fertilization gamodemes of sample size formula_67 ( k = 1 ... &quot;s&quot; ) with &quot; &quot;overlaps&quot; &quot; of proportion formula_68 in which non-dispersive random fertilization occurs. The &quot; dispersive proportion &quot; is thus formula_69. The bulk population consists of &quot;weighted averages&quot; of sample sizes, allele and genotype frequencies and progeny means, as was done for genetic drift in an earlier section. However, each &quot;gamete sample size&quot; is reduced to allow for the &quot;overlaps&quot;, thus finding a formula_70 effective for formula_69.
For brevity, the argument is followed further with the subscripts omitted. Recall that formula_72 is formula_73 in general. [Here, and following, the &quot;2N&quot; refers to the &quot;previously defined&quot; sample size, not to any &quot;islands adjusted&quot; version.]

After simplification, formula_74 
Notice that when &quot;m = 0&quot; this reduces to the previous &quot;Δ f&quot;. The reciprocal of this furnishes an estimate of the &quot; formula_70 &quot;effective for formula_69&quot; &quot;, mentioned above.

This Δf is also substituted into the previous &quot;inbreeding coefficient&quot; to obtain 
formula_77 where &quot;t&quot; is the index over generations, as before.

The effective &quot;overlap proportion&quot; can be obtained also, as 
formula_78

The graphs to the right show the &quot;inbreeding&quot; for a gamodeme size of &quot;2N = 50&quot; for &quot;ordinary dispersed random fertilization &quot; (RF) &quot;(m=0)&quot;, and for &quot;four overlap levels ( m = 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 )&quot; of islands &quot;random fertilization&quot;. There has indeed been reduction in the inbreeding resulting from the &quot;non-dispersed random fertilization&quot; in the overlaps. It is particularly notable as m → 0.50. Sewall Wright suggested that this value should be the limit for the use of this approach.

===Allele shuffling – allele substitution===
The &quot;gene-model&quot; examines the heredity pathway from the point of view of &quot;inputs&quot; (alleles/gametes) and &quot;outputs&quot; (genotypes/zygotes), with fertilization being the &quot;process&quot; converting one to the other. An alternative viewpoint concentrates on the &quot;process&quot; itself, and considers the zygote genotypes as arising from allele shuffling. In particular, it regards the results as if one allele had &quot;substituted&quot; for the other during the shuffle, together with a residual that deviates from this view. This formed an integral part of Fisher&#x27;s method, in addition to his use of frequencies and effects to generate his genetical statistics. A discursive derivation of the &quot;allele substitution&quot; alternative follows. 

Suppose that the usual random fertilization of gametes in a &quot;base&quot; gamodeme—consisting of p gametes (A) and q gametes (a)—is replaced by fertilization with a &quot;flood&quot; of gametes all containing a single allele (A or a, but not both). The zygotic results can be interpreted in terms of the &quot;flood&quot; allele having &quot;substituted for&quot; the alternative allele in the underlying &quot;base&quot; gamodeme. The diagram assists in following this viewpoint: the upper part pictures an A substitution, while the lower part shows an a substitution. (The diagram&#x27;s &quot;RF allele&quot; is the allele in the &quot;base&quot; gamodeme.)

Consider the upper part firstly. Because &quot;base&quot; A is present with a frequency of p, the &quot;substitute&quot; A fertilizes it with a frequency of p resulting in a zygote AA with an allele effect of a. Its contribution to the outcome, therefore, is the product formula_79. Similarly, when the &quot;substitute&quot; fertilizes &quot;base&quot; a (resulting in Aa with a frequency of q and heterozygote effect of d), the contribution is formula_80. The overall result of substitution by A is, therefore, formula_81. This is now oriented towards the population mean [see earlier section] by expressing it as a deviate from that mean : formula_82

After some algebraic simplification, this becomes formula_83 
- the &quot;substitution effect&quot; of A.

A parallel reasoning can be applied to the lower part of the diagram, taking care with the differences in frequencies and gene effects. The result is the &quot;substitution effect&quot; of a, which is formula_84
The common factor inside the brackets is the &quot;average allele substitution effect&quot;, and is formula_85
It can also be derived in a more direct way, but the result is the same.

In subsequent sections, these substitution effects help define the gene-model genotypes as consisting of a partition predicted by these new effects (substitution &quot;expectations&quot;), and a residual (substitution deviations) between these expectations and the previous gene-model effects. The &quot;expectations&quot; are also called the breeding values and the deviations are also called dominance deviations.

Ultimately, the variance arising from the &quot;substitution expectations&quot; becomes the so-called &quot;Additive genetic variance (σ2A)&quot; (also the &quot;Genic variance&quot; )— while that arising from the &quot;substitution deviations&quot; becomes the so-called &quot;Dominance variance (σ2D)&quot;. It is noticeable that neither of these terms reflects the true meanings of these variances. The &quot;genic variance&quot; is less dubious than the &quot; additive genetic variance&quot;, and more in line with Fisher&#x27;s own name for this partition. A less-misleading name for the &quot;dominance deviations variance&quot; is the &quot;quasi-dominance variance&quot; [see following sections for further discussion]. These latter terms are preferred herein.

==== Gene effects redefined====
The gene-model effects (a, d and -a) are important soon in the derivation of the &quot;deviations from substitution&quot;, which were first discussed in the previous &quot;Allele Substitution&quot; section. However, they need to be redefined themselves before they become useful in that exercise. They firstly need to be re-centralized around the population mean (G), and secondly they need to be re-arranged as functions of β, the &quot;average allele substitution effect&quot;.

Consider firstly the re-centralization. The re-centralized effect for AA is a• = a - G which, after simplification, becomes a• = 2&quot;q&quot;(a-&quot;p&quot;d). The similar effect for Aa is d• = d - G = a(&quot;q&quot;-&quot;p&quot;) + d(1-2&quot;pq&quot;), after simplification. Finally, the re-centralized effect for aa is (-a)• = -2&quot;p&quot;(a+&quot;q&quot;d).

Secondly, consider the re-arrangement of these re-centralized effects as functions of β. Recalling from the &quot;Allele Substitution&quot; section that β = [a +(q-p)d], rearrangement gives a = [β -(q-p)d]. After substituting this for a in a• and simplifying, the final version becomes a•• = 2q(β-qd). Similarly, d• becomes d•• = β(q-p) + 2pqd; and (-a)• becomes (-a)•• = -2p(β+pd).

==== Genotype substitution – expectations and deviations====
The zygote genotypes are the target of all this preparation. The homozygous genotype AA is a union of two &quot;substitution effects of A&quot;, one from each sex. Its &quot;substitution expectation&quot; is therefore βAA = 2βA = 2&quot;q&quot;β (see previous sections). Similarly, the &quot;substitution expectation&quot; of Aa is βAa = βA + βa = (&quot;q&quot;-&quot;p&quot;)β; and for aa, βaa = 2βa = -2&quot;p&quot;β. These &quot;substitution expectations&quot; of the genotypes are also called &quot;breeding values&quot;.

&quot;Substitution deviations&quot; are the differences between these &quot;expectations&quot; and the &quot;gene effects&quot; after their two-stage redefinition in the previous section. Therefore, dAA = a•• - βAA = -2&quot;q&quot;2d after simplification. Similarly, dAa = d•• - βAa = 2&quot;pq&quot;d after simplification. Finally, daa = (-a)•• - βaa = -2&quot;p&quot;2d after simplification. Notice that all of these &quot;substitution deviations&quot; ultimately are functions of the gene-effect &quot;d&quot;—which accounts for the use of [&quot;d&quot; plus subscript] as their symbols. However, it is a serious &quot;non sequitur&quot; in logic to regard them as accounting for the dominance (heterozygosis) in the entire gene model : they are simply &quot;functions&quot; of &quot;d&quot; and not an &quot;audit&quot; of the &quot;d&quot; in the system. They &quot;are&quot; as derived: &quot;deviations from the substitution expectations&quot;!

The &quot;substitution expectations&quot; ultimately give rise to the σ2A (the so-called &quot;Additive&quot; genetic variance); and the &quot;substitution deviations&quot; give rise to the σ2D (the so-called &quot;Dominance&quot; genetic variance). Be aware, however, that the average substitution effect (β) also contains &quot;d&quot; [see previous sections], indicating that dominance is also embedded within the &quot;Additive&quot; variance [see following sections on the Genotypic Variance for their derivations]. Remember also [see previous paragraph] that the &quot;substitution deviations&quot; do not account for the dominance in the system (being nothing more than deviations from the &quot;substitution expectations&quot;), but which happen to consist algebraically of functions of &quot;d&quot;. More appropriate names for these respective variances might be σ2B (the &quot;Breeding expectations&quot; variance) and σ2δ (the &quot;Breeding deviations&quot; variance). However, as noted previously, &quot;Genic&quot; (σ 2A) and &quot;Quasi-Dominance&quot; (σ 2D), respectively, will be preferred herein.

===Genotypic variance===
There are two major approaches to defining and partitioning &quot;genotypic variance&quot;. One is based on the &quot;gene-model effects&quot;, while the other is based on the &quot;genotype substitution effects&quot; They are algebraically inter-convertible with each other. In this section, the basic random fertilization derivation is considered, with the effects of inbreeding and dispersion set aside. This is dealt with later to arrive at a more general solution. Until this &quot;mono-genic&quot; treatment is replaced by a &quot;multi-genic&quot; one, and until &quot;epistasis&quot; is resolved in the light of the findings of &quot;epigenetics&quot;, the Genotypic variance has only the components considered here.

==== Gene-model approach – Mather Jinks Hayman====

It is convenient to follow the biometrical approach, which is based on correcting the &quot;unadjusted sum of squares (USS)&quot; by subtracting the &quot;correction factor (CF)&quot;. Because all effects have been examined through frequencies, the USS can be obtained as the sum of the products of each genotype&#x27;s frequency&#x27; and the square of its &quot;gene-effect&quot;. The CF in this case is the mean squared. The result is the SS, which, again because of the use of frequencies, is also immediately the &quot;variance&quot;.

The formula_86, and the formula_87. The formula_88

After partial simplification,
formula_89 
The last line is in Mather&#x27;s terminology.

Here, σ2a is the &quot;homozygote&quot; or allelic variance, and σ2d is the &quot;heterozygote&quot; or dominance variance. The &quot;substitution deviations&quot; variance (σ2D) is also present. The &quot;(weighted_covariance)ad&quot; is abbreviated hereafter to &quot; covad &quot;.

These components are plotted across all values of p in the accompanying figure. Notice that &quot;covad&quot; is negative for &quot;p &gt; 0.5&quot;.

Most of these components are affected by the change of central focus from &quot;homozygote mid-point&quot; (mp) to &quot;population mean&quot; (G), the latter being the basis of the &quot;Correction Factor&quot;. The &quot;covad&quot; and &quot;substitution deviation&quot; variances are simply artifacts of this shift. The &quot;allelic&quot; and &quot;dominance&quot; variances are genuine genetical partitions of the original gene-model, and are the only eu-genetical components. Even then, the algebraic formula for the &quot;allelic&quot; variance is effected by the presence of &quot;G&quot;: it is only the &quot;dominance&quot; variance (i.e. σ2d ) which is unaffected by the shift from &quot;mp&quot; to &quot;G&quot;. These insights are commonly not appreciated.

Further gathering of terms [in Mather format] leads to formula_90, where formula_91. It is useful later in Diallel analysis, which is an experimental design for estimating these genetical statistics.

If, following the last-given rearrangements, the first three terms are amalgamated together, rearranged further and simplified, the result is the variance of the Fisherian &quot;substitution expectation&quot;.

That is: formula_92

Notice particularly that σ2A is not σ2a. The first is the &quot;substitution expectations&quot; variance, while the second is the &quot;allelic&quot; variance. Notice also that σ2D (the &quot;substitution-deviations&quot; variance) is &quot;not&quot; σ2d (the &quot;dominance&quot; variance), and recall that it is an artifact arising from the use of &quot;G&quot; for the Correction Factor. [See the &quot;blue paragraph&quot; above.] It now will be referred to as the &quot;quasi-dominance&quot; variance.

Also note that σ2D &lt; σ2d (&quot;2pq&quot; being always a fraction); and note that (1) σ2D = 2pq σ2d, and that (2) σ2d = σ2D / (2pq). That is: it is confirmed that σ2D does not quantify the dominance variance in the model. It is σ2d which does that. However, the dominance variance (σ2d) can be estimated readily from the σ2D if &quot;2pq&quot; is available.

From the Figure, these results can be visualized as accumulating σ2a, σ2d and covad to obtain σ2A, while leaving the σ2D still separated. It is clear also in the Figure that σ2D &lt; σ2d, as expected from the equations.

The overall result (in Fisher&#x27;s format) is
formula_93 
The Fisherian components have just been derived, but their derivation via the &quot;substitution effects&quot; themselves is given also, in the next section.

==== Allele-substitution approach – Fisher====

Reference to the several earlier sections on allele substitution reveals that the two ultimate effects are &quot;genotype substitution &quot; expectations and &quot;genotype substitution deviations&quot;. Notice that these are each already defined as deviations from the &quot;random fertilization&quot; population mean (G). For each genotype in turn therefore, the product of the frequency and the square of the relevant effect is obtained, and these are accumulated to obtain directly a SS and σ2. Details follow.

σ2A = p&quot;2 βAA2 + 2&quot;pq&quot; βAa2 + q&quot;2 βaa2, which simplifies to σ2A = 2&quot;pq&quot;β2—the Genic variance.

σ2D = p&quot;2 dAA2 + 2&quot;pq&quot; dAa2 + q&quot; daa2, which simplifies to σ2D = (2&quot;pq&quot;)2 d2—the quasi-Dominance variance.

Upon accumulating these results, σ2G = σ2A + σ2D . These components are visualized in the graphs to the right. The &quot;average allele substitution&quot; effect is graphed also, but the symbol is &quot;α&quot; (as is common in the citations) rather than &quot;β&quot; (as is used herein).

Once again, however, refer to the earlier discussions about the true meanings and identities of these components. Fisher himself did not use these modern terms for his components. The &quot;substitution expectations&quot; variance he named the &quot;genetic&quot; variance; and the &quot;substitution deviations&quot; variance he regarded simply as the unnamed residual between the &quot;genotypic&quot; variance (his name for it) and his &quot;genetic&quot; variance. [The terminology and derivation used in this article are completely in accord with Fisher&#x27;s own.] Mather&#x27;s term for the &quot;expectations&quot; variance—&quot;genic&quot;—is obviously derived from Fisher&#x27;s term, and avoids using &quot;genetic&quot; (which has become too generalized in usage to be of value in the present context). The origin is obscure of the modern misleading terms &quot;additive&quot; and &quot;dominance&quot; variances.

Note that this allele-substitution approach defined the components separately, and then totaled them to obtain the final Genotypic variance. Conversely, the gene-model approach derived the whole situation (components and total) as one exercise. Bonuses arising from this were (a) the revelations about the real structure of σ2A, and (b) the real meanings and relative sizes of σ2d and σ2D (see previous sub-section). It is also apparent that a &quot;Mather&quot; analysis is more informative, and that a &quot;Fisher&quot; analysis can always be constructed from it. The opposite conversion is not possible, however, because information about covad would be missing.

===Dispersion and the genotypic variance===
In the section on genetic drift, and in other sections that discuss inbreeding, a major outcome from allele frequency sampling has been the &quot;dispersion&quot; of progeny means. This collection of means has its own average, and also has a variance: the &quot;amongst-line variance&quot;. (This is a variance of the attribute itself, not of &quot;allele frequencies&quot;.) As dispersion develops further over succeeding generations, this amongst-line variance would be expected to increase. Conversely, as homozygosity rises, the within-lines variance would be expected to decrease. The question arises therefore as to whether the total variance is changing—and, if so, in what direction. To date, these issues have been presented in terms of the &quot;genic (σ 2A )&quot; and &quot;quasi-dominance (σ 2D )&quot; variances rather than the gene-model components. This will be done herein as well.

The crucial &quot;overview equation&quot; comes from Sewall Wright, and is the outline of the inbred genotypic variance based on a &quot;weighted average of its extremes&quot;, the weights being quadratic with respect to the &quot;inbreeding coefficient&quot; 
formula_94. This equation is:

formula_95

where formula_94 is the inbreeding coefficient, formula_97 is the genotypic variance at 
&quot;f=0&quot;, formula_98 is the genotypic variance at &quot;f=1&quot;, 
formula_99 is the population mean at &quot;f=0&quot;, and formula_100 is the population mean at &quot;f=1&quot;.

The formula_101 component [in the equation above] outlines the reduction of variance within progeny lines. The formula_94 component addresses the increase in variance amongst progeny lines. Lastly, the formula_103 component is seen (in the next line) to address the &quot;quasi-dominance&quot; variance. These components can be expanded further thereby revealing additional insight. Thus:-

formula_104

Firstly, &quot;σ2G(0)&quot; [in the equation above] has been expanded to show its two sub-components [see section on &quot;Genotypic variance&quot;]. Next, the &quot;σ2G(1)&quot; has been converted to &quot;4pqa2 &quot;, and is derived in a section following. The third component&#x27;s substitution is the difference between the two &quot;inbreeding extremes&quot; of the population mean [see section on the &quot;Population Mean&quot;].
Summarising: the within-line components are formula_105 and formula_106; and the amongst-line components are formula_107 and formula_108.
Rearranging gives the following:
formula_109 
The version in the last line is discussed further in a subsequent section.

Similarly,
formula_110
Graphs to the left show these three genic variances, together with the three quasi-dominance variances, across all values of f, for p = 0.5 (at which the quasi-dominance variance is at a maximum). Graphs to the right show the Genotypic variance partitions (being the sums of the respective &quot;genic&quot; and &quot;quasi-dominance&quot; partitions) changing over ten generations with an example &quot;f = 0.10&quot;.

Answering, firstly, the questions posed at the beginning about the total variances [the Σ in the graphs] : the &quot;genic variance&quot; rises linearly with the &quot;inbreeding coefficient&quot;, maximizing at twice its starting level. The &quot;quasi-dominance variance&quot; declines at the rate of &quot;(1 − f2 )&quot; until it finishes at zero. At low levels of &quot;f&quot;, the decline is very gradual, but it accelerates with higher levels of &quot;f&quot;.

Secondly, notice the other trends. It is probably intuitive that the within line variances decline to zero with continued inbreeding, and this is seen to be the case (both at the same linear rate &quot;(1-f)&quot; ). The amongst line variances both increase with inbreeding up to &quot;f = 0.5&quot;, the &quot;genic variance&quot; at the rate of &quot;2f&quot;, and the &quot;quasi-dominance variance&quot; at the rate of &quot;(f − f2)&quot;. At &quot;f &gt; 0.5&quot;, however, the trends change. The amongst line &quot;genic variance&quot; continues its linear increase until it equals the total &quot;genic variance&quot;. But, the amongst line &quot;quasi-dominance variance&quot; now declines towards &quot;zero&quot;, because &quot;(f − f2)&quot; also declines with &quot;f &gt; 0.5&quot;.

==== Derivation of &quot;σ2G(1)&quot;====
Recall that when &quot;f=1&quot;, heterozygosity is zero, within-line variance is zero, and all genotypic variance is thus &quot;amongst-line&quot; variance and deplete of dominance variance. In other words, σ2G(1) is the variance amongst fully inbred line means. Recall further [from &quot;The mean after self-fertilization&quot; section] that such means (G1&#x27;s, in fact) are G = a(p-q). Substituting &quot;(1-q)&quot; for the &quot;p&quot;, gives G1 = a (1 − 2q) = a − 2aq. Therefore, the σ2G(1) is the σ2(a-2aq) actually. Now, in general, the &quot;variance of a difference (x-y)&quot; is [ σ2x + σ2y − 2 covxy ]. Therefore, σ2G(1) = [ σ2a + σ22aq − 2 cov(a, 2aq) ] . But a (an allele &quot;effect&quot;) and q (an allele &quot;frequency&quot;) are &quot;independent&quot;—so this covariance is zero. Furthermore, a is a constant from one line to the next, so σ2a is also zero. Further, 2a is another constant (k), so the σ22aq is of the type &quot;σ2k X&quot;. In general, the variance &quot;σ2k X&quot; is equal to k2 σ2X . Putting all this together reveals that σ2(a-2aq) = (2a)2 σ2q . Recall [from the section on &quot;Continued genetic drift&quot;] that &quot;σ2q = pq f &quot;. With &quot;f=1&quot; here within this present derivation, this becomes &quot;pq 1&quot; (that is pq), and this is substituted into the previous.

The final result is: σ2G(1) = σ2(a-2aq) = 4a2 pq = 2(2pq a2) = 2 σ2a .

It follows immediately that f&quot; σ2G(1) = &quot;f&quot; 2 σ2a . [This last &quot;f&quot; comes from the &quot;initial Sewall Wright equation&quot; : it is not&quot; the &quot;f &quot; just set to &quot;1&quot; in the derivation concluded two lines above.]

==== Total dispersed genic variance – σ2A(f) and βf ====
Previous sections found that the within line &quot;genic variance&quot; is based upon the &quot;substitution-derived&quot; genic variance ( σ2A )—but the &quot;amongst line&quot; &quot;genic variance&quot; is based upon the &quot;gene model&quot; allelic variance ( σ2a ). These two cannot simply be added to get &quot;total genic variance&quot;. One approach in avoiding this problem was to re-visit the derivation of the &quot;average allele substitution effect&quot;, and to construct a version, ( β &quot;f&quot; ), that incorporates the effects of the dispersion. Crow and Kimura achieved this using the re-centered allele effects (a•, d•, (-a)• ) discussed previously [&quot;Gene effects re-defined&quot;]. However, this was found subsequently to under-estimate slightly the &quot;total Genic variance&quot;, and a new variance-based derivation led to a refined version.
The &quot;refined&quot; version is: β &quot;f&quot; = { a2 + [(1−&quot;f&quot; ) / (1 + &quot;f&quot; )] 2(q − p ) ad + [(1-&quot;f&quot; ) / (1 + &quot;f&quot; )] (q − p )2 d2 } (1/2)

Consequently, σ2A(f) = (1 + &quot;f&quot; ) 2pq βf 2 does now agree with [ (1-f) σ2A(0) + 2f σ2a(0) ] exactly.

==== Total and partitioned dispersed quasi-dominance variances====
The &quot;total genic variance&quot; is of intrinsic interest in its own right. But, prior to the refinements by Gordon, it had had another important use as well. There had been no extant estimators for the &quot;dispersed&quot; quasi-dominance. This had been estimated as the difference between Sewall Wright&#x27;s &quot;inbred genotypic variance&quot; and the total &quot;dispersed&quot; genic variance [see the previous sub-section]. An anomaly appeared, however, because the &quot;total quasi-dominance variance&quot; appeared to increase early in inbreeding despite the decline in heterozygosity. 

The refinements in the previous sub-section corrected this anomaly. At the same time, a direct solution for the &quot;total quasi-dominance variance&quot; was obtained, thus avoiding the need for the &quot;subtraction&quot; method of previous times. Furthermore, direct solutions for the &quot;amongst-line&quot; and &quot;within-line&quot; partitions of the &quot;quasi-dominance variance&quot; were obtained also, for the first time. [These have been presented in the section &quot;Dispersion and the genotypic variance&quot;.]

=== Environmental variance ===
The environmental variance is phenotypic variability, which cannot be ascribed to genetics. This sounds simple, but the experimental design needed to separate the two needs very careful planning. Even the &quot;external&quot; environment can be divided into spatial and temporal components (&quot;Sites&quot; and &quot;Years&quot;); or into partitions such as &quot;litter&quot; or &quot;family&quot;, and &quot;culture&quot; or &quot;history&quot;. These components are very dependent upon the actual experimental model used to do the research. Such issues are very important when doing the research itself, but in this article on quantitative genetics this overview may suffice.

It is an appropriate place, however, for a summary:

Phenotypic variance = genotypic variances + environmental variances + genotype-environment interaction + experimental &quot;error&quot; variance

i.e., σ2P = σ2G + σ2E + σ2GE + σ2

&quot; or&quot; 
σ2P = σ2A + σ2D + σ2I + σ2E + σ2GE + σ2

after partitioning the genotypic variance (G) into component variances &quot;genic&quot; (A), &quot;quasi-dominance&quot; (D), and &quot;epistatic&quot; (I).

The environmental variance will appear in other sections, such as &quot;Heritability&quot; and &quot;Correlated attributes&quot;.

===Heritability and repeatability===
The heritability of a trait is the proportion of the total (phenotypic) variance (σ2 P) that is attributable to genetic variance, whether it be the full genotypic variance, or some component of it. It quantifies the degree to which phenotypic variability is due to genetics: but the precise meaning depends upon which genetical variance partition is used in the numerator of the proportion. Research estimates of heritability have standard errors, just as have all estimated statistics.

Where the numerator variance is the whole Genotypic variance ( σ2G ), the heritability is known as the &quot;broadsense&quot; heritability (&quot;H2&quot;). It quantifies the degree to which variability in an attribute is determined by genetics as a whole. formula_111 [See section on the Genotypic variance.]

If only genic variance (σ2A) is used in the numerator, the heritability may be called &quot;narrow sense&quot; (h2). It quantifies the extent to which phenotypic variance is determined by Fisher&#x27;s &quot;substitution expectations&quot; variance. formula_112Fisher proposed that this narrow-sense heritability might be appropriate in considering the results of natural selection, focusing as it does on change-ability, &quot;that is&quot; upon &quot;adaptation&quot;. He proposed it with regard to quantifying Darwinian evolution.

Recalling that the allelic variance (&quot;σ 2a&quot;) and the dominance variance (&quot;σ 2d&quot;) are eu-genetic components of the gene-model [see section on the Genotypic variance], and that &quot;σ 2D&quot; (the &quot;substitution deviations&quot; or &quot; &quot;quasi-dominance&quot; &quot; variance) and &quot;covad&quot; are due to changing from the homozygote midpoint (mp) to the population mean (G), it can be seen that the real meanings of these heritabilities are obscure. The heritabilities formula_113 and formula_114 have unambiguous meaning.

Narrow-sense heritability has been used also for predicting generally the results of artificial selection. In the latter case, however, the broadsense heritability may be more appropriate, as the whole attribute is being altered: not just adaptive capacity. Generally, advance from selection is more rapid the higher the heritability. [See section on &quot;Selection&quot;.] In animals, heritability of reproductive traits is typically low, while heritability of disease resistance and production are moderately low to moderate, and heritability of body conformation is high.

Repeatability (r2) is the proportion of phenotypic variance attributable to differences in repeated measures of the same subject, arising from later records. It is used particularly for long-lived species. This value can only be determined for traits that manifest multiple times in the organism&#x27;s lifetime, such as adult body mass, metabolic rate or litter size. Individual birth mass, for example, would not have a repeatability value: but it would have a heritability value. Generally, but not always, repeatability indicates the upper level of the heritability.

r2 = (s2G + s2PE)/s2P

where s2PE = phenotype-environment interaction = repeatability.

The above concept of repeatability is, however, problematic for traits that necessarily change greatly between measurements. For example, body mass increases greatly in many organisms between birth and adult-hood. Nonetheless, within a given age range (or life-cycle stage), repeated measures could be done, and repeatability would be meaningful within that stage.

==Relationship==
From the heredity perspective, relations are individuals that inherited genes from one or more common ancestors. Therefore, their &quot;relationship&quot; can be &quot;quantified&quot; on the basis of the probability that they each have inherited a copy of an allele from the common ancestor. In earlier sections, the &quot;Inbreeding coefficient&quot; has been defined as, &quot;the probability that two &quot;same&quot; alleles ( A and A, or a and a ) have a common origin&quot;—or, more formally, &quot;The probability that two homologous alleles are autozygous.&quot; Previously, the emphasis was on an individual&#x27;s likelihood of having two such alleles, and the coefficient was framed accordingly. It is obvious, however, that this probability of autozygosity for an individual must also be the probability that each of its &quot;two parents&quot; had this autozygous allele. In this re-focused form, the probability is called the &quot;co-ancestry coefficient&quot; for the two individuals &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; ( &quot;f&quot; ij ). In this form, it can be used to quantify the relationship between two individuals, and may also be known as the &quot;coefficient of kinship&quot; or the &quot;consanguinity coefficient&quot;. 
===Pedigree analysis===

&quot;Pedigrees&quot; are diagrams of familial connections between individuals and their ancestors, and possibly between other members of the group that share genetical inheritance with them. They are relationship maps. A pedigree can be analyzed, therefore, to reveal coefficients of inbreeding and co-ancestry. Such pedigrees actually are informal depictions of &quot;path diagrams&quot; as used in &quot;path analysis&quot;, which was invented by Sewall Wright when he formulated his studies on inbreeding. Using the adjacent diagram, the probability that individuals &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; have received autozygous alleles from ancestor &quot;A&quot; is &quot;1/2&quot; (one out of the two diploid alleles). This is the &quot;de novo&quot; inbreeding (ΔfPed) at this step. However, the other allele may have had &quot;carry-over&quot; autozygosity from previous generations, so the probability of this occurring is (&quot;de novo complement&quot; multiplied by the &quot;inbreeding of ancestor A&quot; ), that is (1 − ΔfPed ) fA = (1/2) fA . Therefore, the total probability of autozygosity in B and C, following the bi-furcation of the pedigree, is the sum of these two components, namely (1/2) + (1/2)fA = (1/2) (1+f A ) . This can be viewed as the probability that two random gametes from ancestor A carry autozygous alleles, and in that context is called the &quot;coefficient of parentage&quot; ( fAA ). It appears often in the following paragraphs.

Following the &quot;B&quot; path, the probability that any autozygous allele is &quot;passed on&quot; to each successive parent is again (1/2) at each step (including the last one to the &quot;target&quot; X ). The overall probability of transfer down the &quot;B path&quot; is therefore (1/2)3 . The power that (1/2) is raised to can be viewed as &quot;the number of intermediates in the path between A and X &quot;, nB = 3 . Similarly, for the &quot;C path&quot;, nC = 2 , and the &quot;transfer probability&quot; is (1/2)2 . The combined probability of autozygous transfer from A to X is therefore [ fAA (1/2)(nB) (1/2)(nC) ] . Recalling that &quot; fAA = (1/2) (1+f A ) &quot;, fX = fPQ = (1/2)(nB + nC + 1) (1 + fA ) . In this example, assuming that fA = 0, fX = 0.0156 (rounded) = fPQ , one measure of the &quot;relatedness&quot; between P and Q.

In this section, powers of (1/2) were used to represent the &quot;probability of autozygosity&quot;. Later, this same method will be used to represent the proportions of ancestral gene-pools which are inherited down a pedigree [the section on &quot;Relatedness between relatives&quot;].

====Cross-multiplication rules====
In the following sections on sib-crossing and similar topics, a number of &quot;averaging rules&quot; are useful. These derive from path analysis. The rules show that any co-ancestry coefficient can be obtained as the average of &quot;cross-over co-ancestries&quot; between appropriate grand-parental and parental combinations. Thus, referring to the adjacent diagram, &quot;Cross-multiplier 1&quot; is that fPQ = average of ( fAC, fAD, fBC, fBD ) = (1/4) [fAC + fAD + fBC + fBD ] = fY . In a similar fashion, &quot;cross-multiplier 2&quot; states that fPC = (1/2) [ fAC + fBC ]—while &quot;cross-multiplier 3&quot; states that fPD = (1/2) [ fAD + fBD ] . Returning to the first multiplier, it can now be seen also to be fPQ = (1/2) [ fPC + fPD ], which, after substituting multipliers 2 and 3, resumes its original form.

In much of the following, the grand-parental generation is referred to as (t-2), the parent generation as (t-1), and the &quot;target&quot; generation as t.

====Full-sib crossing (FS)====
The diagram to the right shows that &quot;full sib crossing&quot; is a direct application of &quot;cross-Multiplier 1&quot;, with the slight modification that &quot;parents A and B&quot; repeat (in lieu of &quot;C and D&quot;) to indicate that individuals &quot;P1&quot; and &quot;P2&quot; have both of &quot;their&quot; parents in common—that is they are &quot;full siblings&quot;. Individual Y is the result of the crossing of two full siblings. Therefore, fY = fP1,P2 = (1/4) [ fAA + 2 fAB + fBB ] . Recall that fAA and fBB were defined earlier (in Pedigree analysis) as &quot;coefficients of parentage&quot;, equal to &quot; (1/2)[1+fA ] &quot; and &quot; (1/2)[1+fB ] &quot; respectively, in the present context. Recognize that, in this guise, the grandparents &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; represent &quot;generation (t-2) &quot;. Thus, assuming that in any one generation all levels of inbreeding are the same, these two &quot;coefficients of parentage &quot; each represent (1/2) [1 + f(t-2) ] . Now, examine fAB . Recall that this also is &quot;fP1 &quot; or &quot;fP2 &quot;, and so represents &quot;their &quot; generation - f(t-1) . Putting it all together, ft = (1/4) [ 2 fAA + 2 fAB ] = (1/4) [ 1 + f(t-2) + 2 f(t-1) ] . That is the &quot;inbreeding coefficient &quot; for &quot;Full-Sib crossing&quot; . The graph to the left shows the rate of this inbreeding over twenty repetitive generations. The &quot;repetition&quot; means that the progeny after cycle t become the crossing parents that generate cycle (t+1 ), and so on successively. The graphs also show the inbreeding for &quot;random fertilization 2N=20&quot; for comparison. Recall that this inbreeding coefficient for progeny &quot;Y&quot; is also the &quot;co-ancestry coefficient&quot; for its parents, and so is a measure of the &quot;relatedness of the two Fill siblings&quot;.

====Half-sib crossing (HS)====
Derivation of the &quot;half sib crossing&quot; takes a slightly different path to that for Full sibs. In the adjacent diagram, the two half-sibs at generation (t-1) have only one parent in common—parent &quot;A&quot; at generation (t-2). The &quot;cross-multiplier 1&quot; is used again, giving fY = f(P1,P2) = (1/4) [ fAA + fAC + fBA + fBC ] . There is just one &quot;coefficient of parentage&quot; this time, but three &quot;co-ancestry coefficients&quot; at the (t-2) level (one of them—fBC—being a &quot;dummy&quot; and not representing an actual individual in the (t-1) generation). As before, the &quot;coefficient of parentage&quot; is (1/2)[1+fA ] , and the three &quot;co-ancestries&quot; each represent f(t-1) . Recalling that &quot; fA &quot; represents &quot; f(t-2) &quot;, the final gathering and simplifying of terms gives fY = ft = (1/8) [ 1 + f(t-2) + 6 f(t-1) ] . The graphs at left include this &quot;half-sib (HS) inbreeding&quot; over twenty successive generations. As before, this also quantifies the &quot;relatedness&quot; of the two half-sibs at generation (t-1) in its alternative form of f(P1, P2) .

====Self fertilization (SF)====
A pedigree diagram for selfing is on the right. It is so straightforward it does not require any cross-multiplication rules. It employs just the basic juxtaposition of the &quot;inbreeding coefficient&quot; and its alternative the &quot;co-ancestry coefficient&quot;; followed by recognizing that, in this case, the latter is also a &quot;coefficient of parentage&quot;. Thus, fY = f(P1, P1) = ft = (1/2) [ 1 + f(t-1) ] . This is the fastest rate of inbreeding of all types, as can be seen in the graphs above. The selfing curve is, in fact, a graph of the &quot;coefficient of parentage&quot;.

====Cousins crossings====
These are derived with methods similar to those for siblings. As before, the &quot;co-ancestry&quot; viewpoint of the &quot;inbreeding coefficient&quot; provides a measure of &quot;relatedness&quot; between the parents P1 and P2 in these cousin expressions.

The pedigree for &quot;First Cousins (FC)&quot; is given to the right. The prime equation is fY = ft = fP1,P2 = (1/4) [ f1D + f12 + fCD + fC2 ]. After substitution with corresponding inbreeding coefficients, gathering of terms and simplifying, this becomes ft = (1/4) [ 3 f(t-1) + (1/4) [2 f(t-2) + f(t-3) + 1 ]] , which is a version for iteration—useful for observing the general pattern, and for computer programming. A &quot;final&quot; version is ft = (1/16) [ 12 f(t-1) + 2 f(t-2) + f(t-3) + 1 ] . 

The &quot;Second Cousins (SC)&quot; pedigree is on the left. Parents in the pedigree not related to the &quot;common Ancestor&quot; are indicated by numerals instead of letters. Here, the prime equation is fY = ft = fP1,P2 = (1/4) [ f3F + f34 + fEF + fE4 ]. After working through the appropriate algebra, this becomes ft = (1/4) [ 3 f(t-1) + (1/4) [3 f(t-2) + (1/4) [2 f(t-3) + f(t-4) + 1 ]]] , which is the iteration version. A &quot;final&quot; version is ft = (1/64) [ 48 f(t-1) + 12 f(t-2) + 2 f(t-3) + f(t-4) + 1 ] . 

To visualize the &quot;pattern in full cousin&quot; equations, start the series with the &quot;full sib&quot; equation re-written in iteration form: ft = (1/4)[2 f(t-1) + f(t-2) + 1 ]. Notice that this is the &quot;essential plan&quot; of the last term in each of the cousin iterative forms: with the small difference that the generation indices increment by &quot;1&quot; at each cousin &quot;level&quot;. Now, define the &quot;cousin level&quot; as k = 1 (for First cousins), = 2 (for Second cousins), = 3 (for Third cousins), etc., etc.; and = 0 (for Full Sibs, which are &quot;zero level cousins&quot;). The &quot;last term&quot; can be written now as: (1/4) [ 2 f(t-(1+k)) + f(t-(2+k)) + 1] . Stacked in front of this &quot;last term&quot; are one or more &quot;iteration increments&quot; in the form (1/4) [ 3 f(t-j) + ... , where j is the &quot;iteration index&quot; and takes values from 1 ... k over the successive iterations as needed. Putting all this together provides a general formula for all levels of &quot;full cousin&quot; possible, including &quot;Full Sibs&quot;. For kth &quot;level&quot; full cousins, f{k}t = &quot;Ιter&quot;j = 1k { (1/4) [ 3 f(t-j) + }j + (1/4) [ 2 f(t-(1+k)) + f(t-(2+k)) + 1] . At the commencement of iteration, all f(t-&quot;x&quot;) are set at &quot;0&quot;, and each has its value substituted as it is calculated through the generations. The graphs to the right show the successive inbreeding for several levels of Full Cousins. 
For &quot;first half-cousins (FHC)&quot;, the pedigree is to the left. Notice there is just one common ancestor (individual A). Also, as for &quot;second cousins&quot;, parents not related to the common ancestor are indicated by numerals. Here, the prime equation is fY = ft = fP1,P2 = (1/4) [ f3D + f34 + fCD + fC4 ]. After working through the appropriate algebra, this becomes ft = (1/4) [ 3 f(t-1) + (1/8) [6 f(t-2) + f(t-3) + 1 ]] , which is the iteration version. A &quot;final&quot; version is ft = (1/32) [ 24 f(t-1) + 6 f(t-2) + f(t-3) + 1 ] . The iteration algorithm is similar to that for &quot;full cousins&quot;, except that the last term is (1/8) [ 6 f(t-(1+k)) + f(t-(2+k)) + 1 ] . Notice that this last term is basically similar to the half sib equation, in parallel to the pattern for full cousins and full sibs. In other words, half sibs are &quot;zero level&quot; half cousins.

There is a tendency to regard cousin crossing with a human-oriented point of view, possibly because of a wide interest in Genealogy. The use of pedigrees to derive the inbreeding perhaps reinforces this &quot;Family History&quot; view. However, such kinds of inter-crossing occur also in natural populations—especially those that are sedentary, or have a &quot;breeding area&quot; that they re-visit from season to season. The progeny-group of a harem with a dominant male, for example, may contain elements of sib-crossing, cousin crossing, and backcrossing, as well as genetic drift, especially of the &quot;island&quot; type. In addition to that, the occasional &quot;outcross&quot; adds an element of hybridization to the mix. It is &quot;not&quot; panmixia.

====Backcrossing (BC)====

Following the hybridizing between A and R, the F1 (individual B) is crossed back (BC1) to an original parent (R) to produce the BC1 generation (individual C). [It is usual to use the same label for the act of &quot;making&quot; the back-cross &quot;and&quot; for the generation produced by it. The act of back-crossing is here in &quot;italics&quot;. ] Parent R is the &quot;recurrent&quot; parent. Two successive backcrosses are depicted, with individual D being the BC2 generation. These generations have been given &quot;t&quot; indices also, as indicated. As before, fD = ft = fCR = (1/2) [ fRB + fRR ] , using &quot;cross-multiplier 2&quot; previously given. The &quot;fRB&quot; just defined is the one that involves generation &quot;(t-1)&quot; with &quot;(t-2)&quot;. However, there is another such &quot;fRB&quot; contained wholly &quot;within&quot; generation &quot;(t-2)&quot; as well, and it is &quot;this&quot; one that is used now: as the &quot;co-ancestry&quot; of the &quot;parents&quot; of individual C in generation &quot;(t-1)&quot;. As such, it is also the &quot;inbreeding coefficient&quot; of C, and hence is f(t-1). The remaining fRR is the &quot;coefficient of parentage&quot; of the &quot;recurrent parent&quot;, and so is &quot;(1/2) [1 + fR ] &quot;. Putting all this together : ft = (1/2) [ (1/2) [ 1 + fR ] + f(t-1) ] = (1/4) [ 1 + fR + 2 f(t-1) ] . The graphs at right illustrate Backcross inbreeding over twenty backcrosses for three different levels of (fixed) inbreeding in the Recurrent parent.

This routine is commonly used in Animal and Plant Breeding programmes. Often after making the hybrid (especially if individuals are short-lived), the recurrent parent needs separate &quot;line breeding&quot; for its maintenance as a future recurrent parent in the backcrossing. This maintenance may be through selfing, or through full-sib or half-sib crossing, or through restricted randomly fertilized populations, depending on the species&#x27; reproductive possibilities. Of course, this incremental rise in fR carries-over into the ft of the backcrossing. The result is a more gradual curve rising to the asymptotes than shown in the present graphs, because the &quot;fR&quot; is not at a fixed level from the outset.

=== Contributions from ancestral genepools ===
In the section on &quot;Pedigree analysis&quot;, formula_115 was used to represent probabilities of autozygous allele descent over n generations down branches of the pedigree. This formula arose because of the rules imposed by sexual reproduction: (i) two parents contributing virtually equal shares of autosomal genes, and (ii) successive dilution for each generation between the zygote and the &quot;focus&quot; level of parentage. These same rules apply also to any other viewpoint of descent in a two-sex reproductive system. One such is the proportion of any ancestral gene-pool (also known as &#x27;germplasm&#x27;) which is contained within any zygote&#x27;s genotype.

Therefore, the proportion of an ancestral genepool in a genotype is:
formula_116 
where n = number of sexual generations between the zygote and the focus ancestor.

For example, each parent defines a genepool contributing formula_117 to its offspring; while each great-grandparent contributes formula_118 to its great-grand-offspring.

The zygote&#x27;s total genepool (Γ) is, of course, the sum of the sexual contributions to its descent.
formula_119

====Relationship through ancestral genepools====
Individuals descended from a common ancestral genepool obviously are related. This is not to say they are identical in their genes (alleles), because, at each level of ancestor, segregation and assortment will have occurred in producing gametes. But they will have originated from the same pool of alleles available for these meioses and subsequent fertilizations. [This idea was encountered firstly in the sections on pedigree analysis and relationships.] The genepool contributions [see section above] of their nearest common ancestral genepool(an &quot;ancestral node&quot;) can therefore be used to define their relationship. This leads to an intuitive definition of relationship which conforms well with familiar notions of &quot;relatedness&quot; found in family-history; and permits comparisons of the &quot;degree of relatedness&quot; for complex patterns of relations arising from such genealogy.

The only modifications necessary (for each individual in turn) are in Γ and are due to the shift to &quot;shared common ancestry&quot; rather than &quot;individual total ancestry&quot;. For this, define Ρ (in lieu of Γ); m = number of ancestors-in-common at the node (i.e. m = 1 or 2 only); and an &quot;individual index&quot; k. Thus:

formula_120

where, as before, &quot;n = number of sexual generations&quot; between the individual and the ancestral node.

An example is provided by two first full-cousins. Their nearest common ancestral node is their grandparents which gave rise to their two sibling parents, and they have both of these grandparents in common. [See earlier pedigree.] For this case, &quot;m=2&quot; and &quot;n=2&quot;, so for each of them

formula_121

In this simple case, each cousin has numerically the same Ρ .

A second example might be between two full cousins, but one (&quot;k=1&quot;) has three generations back to the ancestral node (n=3), and the other (&quot;k=2&quot;) only two (n=2) [i.e. a second and first cousin relationship]. For both, m=2 (they are full cousins).

formula_122

and

formula_123

Notice each cousin has a different Ρ k.

====GRC – genepool relationship coefficient====
In any pairwise relationship estimation, there is one Ρk for each individual: it remains to average them in order to combine them into a single &quot;Relationship coefficient&quot;. Because each &quot;Ρ&quot; is a fraction of a total genepool, the appropriate average for them is the &quot;geometric mean&quot; This average is their Genepool Relationship Coefficient—the &quot;GRC&quot;.

For the first example (two full first-cousins), their GRC = 0.5; for the second case (a full first and second cousin), their GRC = 0.3536. 
All of these relationships (GRC) are applications of path-analysis. A summary of some levels of relationship (GRC) follow.

==Resemblances between relatives==
These, in like manner to the Genotypic variances, can be derived through either the gene-model (&quot;Mather&quot;) approach or the allele-substitution (&quot;Fisher&quot;) approach. Here, each method is demonstrated for alternate cases.

===Parent-offspring covariance===
These can be viewed either as the covariance between any offspring and &quot;any one&quot; of its parents (PO), or as the covariance between any offspring and the &quot; &quot;mid-parent&quot; &quot; value of both its parents (MPO).

==== One-parent and offspring (PO)====
This can be derived as the &quot;sum of cross-products&quot; between parent gene-effects and &quot;one-half&quot; of the progeny expectations using the allele-substitution approach. The &quot;one-half&quot; of the progeny expectation accounts for the fact that &quot;only one of the two parents&quot; is being considered. The appropriate parental gene-effects are therefore the second-stage redefined gene effects used to define the genotypic variances earlier, that is: a = 2q(a − qd) and d = (q-p)a + 2pqd and also (-a) = -2p(a + pd) [see section &quot;Gene effects redefined&quot;]. Similarly, the appropriate progeny effects, for allele-substitution expectations are one-half of the earlier &quot;breeding values&quot;, the latter being: aAA = 2qa, and aAa = (q-p)a and also aaa = -2pa [see section on &quot;Genotype substitution – Expectations and Deviations&quot;].

Because all of these effects are defined already as deviates from the genotypic mean, the cross-product sum using {genotype-frequency * parental gene-effect * half-breeding-value} immediately provides the &quot;allele-substitution-expectation covariance&quot; between any one parent and its offspring. After careful gathering of terms and simplification, this becomes cov(PO)A = pqa2 = s2A . 

Unfortunately, the &quot;allele-substitution-deviations&quot; are usually overlooked, but they have not &quot;ceased to exist&quot; nonetheless! Recall that these deviations are: dAA = -2q2 d, and dAa = 2pq d and also daa = -2p2 d [see section on &quot;Genotype substitution – Expectations and Deviations&quot;]. Consequently, the cross-product sum using {genotype-frequency * parental gene-effect * half-substitution-deviations} also immediately provides the allele-substitution-deviations covariance between any one parent and its offspring. Once more, after careful gathering of terms and simplification, this becomes cov(PO)D = 2p2q2d2 = s2D .

It follows therefore that: cov(PO) = cov(PO)A + cov(PO)D = s2A + s2D , when dominance is &quot;not&quot; overlooked !

==== Mid-parent and offspring (MPO)====
Because there are many combinations of parental genotypes, there are many different mid-parents and offspring means to consider, together with the varying frequencies of obtaining each parental pairing. The gene-model approach is the most expedient in this case. Therefore, an &quot;unadjusted sum of cross-products (USCP)&quot;—using all products { parent-pair-frequency * mid-parent-gene-effect * offspring-genotype-mean }—is adjusted by subtracting the {overall genotypic mean}2 as &quot;correction factor&quot; (CF). After multiplying out all the various combinations, carefully gathering terms, simplifying, factoring and cancelling-out where applicable, this becomes:

cov(MPO) = pq [a + (q-p)d ]2 = pq a2 = s2A , with no dominance having been overlooked in this case, as it had been used-up in defining the a. 

==== Applications (parent-offspring)====
The most obvious application is an experiment that contains all parents and their offspring, with or without reciprocal crosses, preferably replicated without bias, enabling estimation of all appropriate means, variances and covariances, together with their standard errors. These estimated statistics can then be used to estimate the genetic variances. Twice &quot;the difference between the estimates of the two forms of (corrected) parent-offspring covariance&quot; provides an estimate of s2D; and twice the &quot;cov(MPO)&quot; estimates s2A. With appropriate experimental design and analysis, standard errors can be obtained for these genetical statistics as well. This is the basic core of an experiment known as &quot;Diallel analysis&quot;, the Mather, Jinks and Hayman version of which is discussed in another section.

A second application involves using &quot;regression analysis&quot;, which estimates from statistics the ordinate (Y-estimate), derivative (regression coefficient) and constant (Y-intercept) of calculus. The &quot;regression coefficient&quot; estimates the &quot;rate of change&quot; of the function predicting Y from X, based on minimizing the residuals between the fitted curve and the observed data (MINRES). No alternative method of estimating such a function satisfies this basic requirement of MINRES. In general, the regression coefficient is estimated as &quot;the ratio of the covariance(XY) to the variance of the determinator (X)&quot;. In practice, the sample size is usually the same for both X and Y, so this can be written as SCP(XY) / SS(X), where all terms have been defined previously. In the present context, the parents are viewed as the &quot;determinative variable&quot; (X), and the offspring as the &quot;determined variable&quot; (Y), and the regression coefficient as the &quot;functional relationship&quot; (ßPO) between the two. Taking cov(MPO) = s2A as cov(XY), and s2P / 2 (the variance of the mean of two parents—the mid-parent) as s2X, it can be seen that ßMPO = [ s2A] / [ s2P] = h2 . Next, utilizing cov(PO) = [ s2A + s2D ] as cov(XY), and s2P as s2X, it is seen that 2 ßPO = [ 2 ( s2A + s2D )] / s2P = H2 .

Analysis of &quot;epistasis&quot; has previously been attempted via an &quot;interaction variance&quot; approach of the type &quot; s2AA &quot;, and &quot; s2AD&quot; and also &quot; s2DD&quot;. This has been integrated with these present covariances in an effort to provide estimators for the epistasis variances. However, the findings of epigenetics suggest that this may not be an appropriate way to define epistasis.

===Siblings covariances===
Covariance between half-sibs (HS) is defined easily using allele-substitution methods; but, once again, the dominance contribution has historically been omitted. However, as with the mid-parent/offspring covariance, the covariance between full-sibs (FS) requires a &quot;parent-combination&quot; approach, thereby necessitating the use of the gene-model corrected-cross-product method; and the dominance contribution has not historically been overlooked. The superiority of the gene-model derivations is as evident here as it was for the Genotypic variances.

====Half-sibs of the same common-parent (HS)====
The sum of the cross-products { common-parent frequency * half-breeding-value of one half-sib * half-breeding-value of any other half-sib in that same common-parent-group } immediately provides one of the required covariances, because the effects used [&quot;breeding values&quot;—representing the allele-substitution expectations] are already defined as deviates from the genotypic mean [see section on &quot;Allele substitution – Expectations and deviations&quot;]. After simplification. this becomes: cov(HS)A = pq a2 = s2A . However, the &quot;substitution deviations&quot; also exist, defining the sum of the cross-products { common-parent frequency * half-substitution-deviation of one half-sib * half-substitution-deviation of any other half-sib in that same common-parent-group }, which ultimately leads to: cov(HS)D = p2 q2 d2 = s2D . Adding the two components gives:

cov(HS) = cov(HS)A + cov(HS)D = s2A + s2D .

====Full-sibs (FS)====
As explained in the introduction, a method similar to that used for mid-parent/progeny covariance is used. Therefore, an &quot;unadjusted sum of cross-products&quot; (USCP) using all products—{ parent-pair-frequency * the square of the offspring-genotype-mean }—is adjusted by subtracting the {overall genotypic mean}2 as &quot;correction factor (CF)&quot;. In this case, multiplying out all combinations, carefully gathering terms, simplifying, factoring, and cancelling-out is very protracted. It eventually becomes:

cov(FS) = pq a2 + p2 q2 d2 = s2A + s2D , with no dominance having been overlooked. 

====Applications (siblings)====
The most useful application here for genetical statistics is the &quot;correlation between half-sibs&quot;. Recall that the correlation coefficient (&quot;r&quot;) is the ratio of the covariance to the variance [see section on &quot;Associated attributes&quot; for example]. Therefore, rHS = cov(HS) / s2all HS together = [ s2A + s2D ] / s2P = H2 . The correlation between full-sibs is of little utility, being rFS = cov(FS) / s2all FS together = [ s2A + s2D ] / s2P . The suggestion that it &quot;approximates&quot; (&quot; h2&quot;) is poor advice.

Of course, the correlations between siblings are of intrinsic interest in their own right, quite apart from any utility they may have for estimating heritabilities or genotypic variances.

It may be worth noting that [ cov(FS) − cov(HS)] = s2A . Experiments consisting of FS and HS families could utilize this by using intra-class correlation to equate experiment variance components to these covariances [see section on &quot;Coefficient of relationship as an intra-class correlation&quot; for the rationale behind this].

The earlier comments regarding epistasis apply again here [see section on &quot;Applications (Parent-offspring&quot;].

==Selection==
===Basic principles===
Selection operates on the attribute (phenotype), such that individuals that equal or exceed a selection threshold (zP) become effective parents for the next generation. The &quot;proportion&quot; they represent of the base population is the &quot;selection pressure&quot;. The &quot;smaller&quot; the proportion, the &quot;stronger&quot; the pressure. The &quot;mean of the selected group&quot; (Ps) is superior to the &quot;base-population mean&quot; (P0) by the difference called the &quot;selection differential (S)&quot;. All these quantities are phenotypic. To &quot;link&quot; to the underlying genes, a &quot;heritability&quot; (h2) is used, fulfilling the role of a &quot;coefficient of determination&quot; in the biometrical sense. The &quot;expected genetical change&quot;—still expressed in &quot;phenotypic units of measurement&quot;—is called the &quot;genetic advance (ΔG)&quot;, and is obtained by the product of the &quot;selection differential (S)&quot; and its &quot;coefficient of determination&quot; (h2). The expected &quot;mean of the progeny&quot; (P1) is found by adding the &quot;genetic advance (ΔG)&quot; to the &quot;base mean (P0)&quot;. The graphs to the right show how the (initial) genetic advance is greater with stronger selection pressure (smaller &quot;probability&quot;). They also show how progress from successive cycles of selection (even at the same selection pressure) steadily declines, because the Phenotypic variance and the Heritability are being diminished by the selection itself. This is discussed further shortly.
Thus formula_124. 
and formula_125. 

The &quot;narrow-sense heritability (h2)&quot; is usually used, thereby linking to the &quot;genic variance (σ2A) &quot;. However, if appropriate, use of the &quot;broad-sense heritability (H2)&quot; would connect to the &quot;genotypic variance (σ2G)&quot;; and even possibly an &quot;allelic heritability [ h2eu = (σ2a) / (σ2P) ]&quot; might be contemplated, connecting to (σ2a ). [See section on Heritability.]

To apply these concepts &quot;before&quot; selection actually takes place, and so predict the outcome of alternatives (such as choice of &quot;selection threshold&quot;, for example), these phenotypic statistics are re-considered against the properties of the Normal Distribution, especially those concerning truncation of the &quot;superior tail&quot; of the Distribution. In such consideration, the &quot;standardized&quot; selection differential (i) and the &quot;standardized&quot; selection threshold (z) are used instead of the previous &quot;phenotypic&quot; versions. The phenotypic standard deviate (σP(0)) is also needed. This is described in a subsequent section.

Therefore, ΔG = (i σP) h2, where &quot;(i σP(0))&quot; = &quot;S&quot; previously. 

The text above noted that successive ΔG declines because the &quot;input&quot; [the phenotypic variance ( σ2P )] is reduced by the previous selection. The heritability also is reduced. The graphs to the left show these declines over ten cycles of repeated selection during which the same selection pressure is asserted. The accumulated genetic advance (ΣΔG) has virtually reached its asymptote by generation 6 in this example. This reduction depends partly upon truncation properties of the Normal Distribution, and partly upon the heritability together with &quot;meiosis determination ( b2 )&quot;. The last two items quantify the extent to which the &quot;truncation&quot; is &quot;offset&quot; by new variation arising from segregation and assortment during meiosis. This is discussed soon, but here note the simplified result for &quot;undispersed random fertilization (f = 0)&quot;.

Thus : σ2P(1) = σ2P(0) [1 − i ( i-z) h2], where i ( i-z) = K = truncation coefficient and h2 = R = reproduction coefficient This can be written also as σ2P(1) = σ2P(0) [1 − K R ], which facilitates more detailed analysis of selection problems.

Here, i and z have already been defined, &#x27; is the &quot;meiosis determination (b2) for f=0, and the remaining symbol is the heritability. These are discussed further in following sections. Also notice that, more generally, R = b2 h2. If the general meiosis determination ( b2 )&quot;&#x27; is used, the results of prior inbreeding can be incorporated into the selection. The phenotypic variance equation then becomes:

σ2P(1) = σ2P(0) [1 − i ( i-z) b2 h2].

The &quot;Phenotypic variance&quot; truncated by the &quot;selected group&quot; ( σ2P(S) ) is simply σ2P(0) [1 − K], and its contained &quot;genic variance&quot; is (h20 σ2P(S) ). Assuming that selection has not altered the &quot;environmental&quot; variance, the &quot;genic variance&quot; for the progeny can be approximated by σ2A(1) = ( σ2P(1) − σ2E) . From this, h21 = ( σ2A(1) / σ2P(1) ). Similar estimates could be made for σ2G(1) and H21, or for σ2a(1) and h2eu(1) if required.

====Alternative ΔG====
The following rearrangement is useful for considering selection on multiple attributes (characters). It starts by expanding the heritability into its variance components. ΔG = i σP ( σ2A / σ2P ) . The &quot;σP&quot; and &quot;σ2P&quot; partially cancel, leaving a solo &quot;σP&quot;. Next, the &quot;σ2A&quot; inside the heritability can be expanded as (&quot;σA × σA&quot;), which leads to :

ΔG = i σA ( σA / σP ) = i σA h .

Corresponding re-arrangements could be made using the alternative heritabilities, giving ΔG = i σG H or ΔG = i σa heu.

===== Polygenic Adaptation Models in Population Genetics =====

This traditional view of adaptation in quantitative genetics provides a model for how the selected phenotype changes over time, as a function of the selection differential and heritability. However it does not provide insight into (nor does it depend upon) any of the genetic details - in particular, the number of loci involved, their allele frequencies and effect sizes, and the frequency changes driven by selection. This, in contrast, is the focus of work on polygenic adaptation within the field of population genetics. Recent studies have shown that traits such as height have evolved in humans during the past few thousands of years as a result of small allele frequency shifts at thousands of variants that affect height.

===Background===
====Standardized selection – the normal distribution====

The entire &quot;base population&quot; is outlined by the normal curve to the right. Along the Z axis is every value of the attribute from least to greatest, and the height from this axis to the curve itself is the frequency of the value at the axis below. The equation for finding these frequencies for the &quot;normal&quot; curve (the curve of &quot;common experience&quot;) is given in the ellipse. Notice it includes the mean (μ) and the variance (σ2). Moving infinitesimally along the z-axis, the frequencies of neighbouring values can be &quot;stacked&quot; beside the previous, thereby accumulating an area that represents the probability of obtaining all values within the stack. [That&#x27;s integration from calculus.] Selection focuses on such a probability area, being the shaded-in one from the &quot;selection threshold (z)&quot; to the end of the superior tail of the curve. This is the &quot;selection pressure&quot;. The selected group (the effective parents of the next generation) include all phenotype values from z to the &quot;end&quot; of the tail. The mean of the selected group is μs, and the difference between it and the base mean (μ) represents the selection differential (S). By taking partial integrations over curve-sections of interest, and some rearranging of the algebra, it can be shown that the &quot;selection differential&quot; is S = [ y (σ / Prob.)] , where y is the &quot;frequency&quot; of the value at the &quot;selection threshold&quot; z (the &quot;ordinate&quot; of &quot;z&quot;). Rearranging this relationship gives S / σ = y / Prob., the left-hand side of which is, in fact, &quot;selection differential divided by standard deviation&quot;—that is the &quot;standardized selection differential (i)&quot;. The right-side of the relationship provides an &quot;estimator&quot; for i—the ordinate of the &quot;selection threshold&quot; divided by the &quot;selection pressure&quot;. Tables of the Normal Distribution can be used, but tabulations of i itself are available also. The latter reference also gives values of i adjusted for small populations (400 and less), where &quot;quasi-infinity&quot; cannot be assumed (but &quot;was&quot; presumed in the &quot;Normal Distribution&quot; outline above). The &quot;standardized selection differential (i)&quot; is known also as the intensity of selection.

Finally, a cross-link with the differing terminology in the previous sub-section may be useful: μ (here) = &quot;P0&quot; (there), μS = &quot;PS&quot; and σ2 = &quot;σ2P&quot;.

====Meiosis determination – reproductive path analysis====

The meiosis determination (b2) is the &quot;coefficient of determination&quot; of meiosis, which is the cell-division whereby parents generate gametes. Following the principles of &quot;standardized partial regression&quot;, of which path analysis is a pictorially oriented version, Sewall Wright analyzed the paths of gene-flow during sexual reproduction, and established the &quot;strengths of contribution&quot; (&quot;coefficients of determination&quot;) of various components to the overall result. Path analysis includes &quot;partial correlations&quot; as well as &quot;partial regression coefficients&quot; (the latter are the &quot;path coefficients&quot;). Lines with a single arrow-head are directional &quot;determinative paths&quot;, and lines with double arrow-heads are &quot;correlation connections&quot;. Tracing various routes according to &quot;path analysis rules&quot; emulates the algebra of standardized partial regression.

The path diagram to the left represents this analysis of sexual reproduction. Of its interesting elements, the important one in the selection context is &quot;meiosis&quot;. That&#x27;s where segregation and assortment occur—the processes that partially ameliorate the truncation of the phenotypic variance that arises from selection. The path coefficients b are the meiosis paths. Those labeled a are the fertilization paths. The correlation between gametes from the same parent (g) is the &quot;meiotic correlation&quot;. That between parents within the same generation is rA. That between gametes from different parents (f) became known subsequently as the &quot;inbreeding coefficient&quot;. The primes ( &#x27; ) indicate generation (t-1), and the &quot;un&quot;primed indicate generation t. Here, some important results of the present analysis are given. Sewall Wright interpreted many in terms of inbreeding coefficients.

The meiosis determination (b2) is &quot; (1+g)&quot; and equals (1 + f(t-1)) , implying that g = f(t-1). With non-dispersed random fertilization, f(t-1)) = 0, giving b2 = , as used in the selection section above. However, being aware of its background, other fertilization patterns can be used as required. Another determination also involves inbreeding—the fertilization determination (a2) equals 1 / [ 2 ( 1 + ft ) ] . Also another correlation is an inbreeding indicator—rA = 2 ft / ( 1 + f(t-1) ), also known as the &quot;coefficient of relationship&quot;. [Do not confuse this with the &quot;coefficient of kinship&quot;—an alternative name for the &quot;co-ancestry coefficient&quot;. See introduction to &quot;Relationship&quot; section.] This rA re-occurs in the sub-section on dispersion and selection.

These links with inbreeding reveal interesting facets about sexual reproduction that are not immediately apparent. The graphs to the right plot the &quot;meiosis&quot; and &quot;syngamy (fertilization)&quot; coefficients of determination against the inbreeding coefficient. There it is revealed that as inbreeding increases, meiosis becomes more important (the coefficient increases), while syngamy becomes less important. The overall role of reproduction [the product of the previous two coefficients—r2] remains the same. This &quot;increase in b2&quot; is particularly relevant for selection because it means that the &quot;selection truncation of the Phenotypic variance&quot; is offset to a lesser extent during a sequence of selections when accompanied by inbreeding (which is frequently the case).

===Genetic drift and selection===
The previous sections treated &quot;dispersion&quot; as an &quot;assistant&quot; to &quot;selection&quot;, and it became apparent that the two work well together. In quantitative genetics, selection is usually examined in this &quot;biometrical&quot; fashion, but the changes in the means (as monitored by ΔG) reflect the changes in allele and genotype frequencies beneath this surface. Referral to the section on &quot;Genetic drift&quot; brings to mind that it also effects changes in allele and genotype frequencies, and associated means; and that this is the companion aspect to the dispersion considered here (&quot;the other side of the same coin&quot;). However, these two forces of frequency change are seldom in concert, and may often act contrary to each other. One (selection) is &quot;directional&quot; being driven by selection pressure acting on the phenotype: the other (genetic drift) is driven by &quot;chance&quot; at fertilization (binomial probabilities of gamete samples). If the two tend towards the same allele frequency, their &quot;coincidence&quot; is the probability of obtaining that frequencies sample in the genetic drift: the likelihood of their being &quot;in conflict&quot;, however, is the &quot;sum of probabilities of all the alternative frequency samples&quot;. In extreme cases, a single syngamy sampling can undo what selection has achieved, and the probabilities of it happening are available. It is important to keep this in mind. However, genetic drift resulting in sample frequencies similar to those of the selection target does not lead to so drastic an outcome—instead slowing progress towards selection goals.

==Correlated attributes==
Upon jointly observing two (or more) attributes (&quot;e.g.&quot; height and mass), it may be noticed that they vary together as genes or environments alter. This co-variation is measured by the covariance, which can be represented by &quot; cov &quot; or by θ. It will be positive if they vary together in the same direction; or negative if they vary together but in opposite direction. If the two attributes vary independently of each other, the covariance will be zero. The degree of association between the attributes is quantified by the correlation coefficient (symbol r or ρ ). In general, the correlation coefficient is the ratio of the &quot;covariance&quot; to the geometric mean of the two variances of the attributes. Observations usually occur at the phenotype, but in research they may also occur at the &quot;effective haplotype&quot; (effective gene product) [see Figure to the right]. Covariance and correlation could therefore be &quot;phenotypic&quot; or &quot;molecular&quot;, or any other designation which an analysis model permits. The phenotypic covariance is the &quot;outermost&quot; layer, and corresponds to the &quot;usual&quot; covariance in Biometrics/Statistics. However, it can be partitioned by any appropriate research model in the same way as was the phenotypic variance. For every partition of the covariance, there is a corresponding partition of the correlation. Some of these partitions are given below. The first subscript (G, A, etc.) indicates the partition. The second-level subscripts (X, Y) are &quot;place-keepers&quot; for any two attributes.

The first example is the &quot;un-partitioned&quot; phenotype.

The genetical partitions (a) &quot;genotypic&quot; (overall genotype),(b) &quot;genic&quot; (substitution expectations) and (c) &quot;allelic&quot; (homozygote) follow.

(b) formula_128

(c) formula_129

With an appropriately designed experiment, a &quot;non-genetical&quot; (environment) partition could be obtained also.

===Underlying causes of correlation===

There are several different ways that phenotypic correlation can arise. Study design, sample size, sample statistics, and other factors can influence the ability to distinguish between them with more or less statistical confidence. Each of these have different scientific significance, and are relevant to different fields of work.

====Direct causation====
One phenotype may directly affect another phenotype, by influencing development, metabolism, or behavior.

====Genetic pathways====
A common gene or transcription factor in the biological pathways for the two phenotypes can result in correlation.

====Metabolic pathways====
The metabolic pathways from gene to phenotype are complex and varied, but the causes of correlation amongst attributes lie within them.

====Developmental and environmental factors====
Multiple phenotypes may be affected by the same factors. For example, there are many phenotypic attributes correlated with age, and so height, weight, caloric intake, endocrine function, and more all have a correlation. A study looking for other common factors must rule these out first.

====Correlated genotypes and selective pressures====
Differences between subgroups in a population, between populations, or selective biases can mean that some combinations of genes are overrepresented compared with what would be expected. While the genes may not have a significant influence on each other, there may still be a correlation between them, especially when certain genotypes are not allowed to mix. Populations in the process of genetic divergence or having already undergone it can have different characteristic phenotypes, which means that when considered together, a correlation appears. Phenotypic qualities in humans that predominantly depend on ancestry also produce correlations of this type. This can also be observed in dog breeds where several physical features make up the distinctness of a given breed, and are therefore correlated. Assortative mating, which is the sexually selective pressure to mate with a similar phenotype, can result in genotypes remaining correlated more than would be expected.

<text>Sultan Kudarat, officially the Province of Sultan Kudarat (; Maguindanaon: &quot;Dairat nu Sultan Kudarat&quot;, Jawi: دايرت نو سولتان كودرت; ; Ilocano: &quot;Probinsia ti Sultan Kudarat&quot;; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the Soccsksargen region in Mindanao. Its capital is Isulan while the commercial center and largest city is Tacurong.

On February 23, 1995, Sultan Kudarat transferred from the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (now Bangsamoro Autonomous Region) to Soccsksargen.

==Etymology ==
The name &quot;Sultan Kudarat&quot; given to the province was derived from the Maguindanaon Muslim ruler, Sultan Muhammad Dipatuan Kudarat who began to assert his leadership in the year 1619 and reigned in the Sultanate of Maguindanao from 1625 to 1671. Through his leadership, Spanish forces were successfully repelled from encroaching the Cotabato region of south-central Mindanao. He is considered a national hero, and in his honor, the province was named after him.

==History==

Sultan Kudarat was once part of the Sultanate of Maguindanao. It became one of the strongholds of the Maguindanao society as some royal families established their own Sultanate in the region.

Sultan Kudarat was part of the former province of Cotabato, until its creation as an independent province (along with Maguindanao and North Cotabato) on November 22, 1973, through &quot;Presidential Decree No. 341&quot;.
=== Palimbang Massacre ===

One notable event that took place in Sultan Kudarat was the Palimbang Massacre (also called the Malisbong Masjid Massacre), which saw the mass murder of Moro residents of Barrio Malisbong in Palimbang by units of the Philippine Military on September 24, 1974,–1,500 two years after Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law. Accounts compiled by the Moro Women&#x27;s Center in General Santos state that 1,500 male Moros aged 11–70 were killed inside a mosque, 3,000 women and children aged 9–60 were detained – with the women being raped – and 300 houses were razed by the government forces.

====Sultan Kudarat (Tacurong) Bird Festival====
On May 10 and 11 of 2024, Tacurong held the 8th &quot;Sultan Kudarat Bird Festival&quot; at the 2.5-hectare Baras Bird Sanctuary, the largest nesting site of 20,000 bird species, particularly those of egrets and herons.

==Geography==
Sultan Kudarat is situated in the southwestern section of central Mindanao. It is bounded on the north by the provinces of Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur and Cotabato; on the south by South Cotabato and Sarangani; on the east by Davao del Sur; and on the west by the Moro Gulf and the Celebes Sea. The province&#x27;s total land area is .

Two major mountain ranges encompass the province; the Alip Mountain Range in Columbio and the Daguma Mountain Range within the towns of Bagumbayan, Isulan, and Esperanza. The three coastal towns on the province&#x27;s western side (Lebak, Kalamansig, and Palimbang) are lined with mountain ranges that separate the central part of the province from the sea. There are also mountains on the eastern side, leaving flat land in between.

The province has an irregular coastline of in its three coastal towns, which face the Celebes Sea. These coastal areas are prone to tsunamis coming from the Celebes Sea. Approximately 2/3 of Lake Buluan&#x27;s area is covered by the province in the towns of Lutayan and President Quirino. There are 7 major rivers within the province: Alip, Allah, Kapingkong, Tran, Salaman, Palimbang and Kabulnan. Additionally, there are 23 large creeks and 11 major springs within the province.

===Land use and soil types===
Forestland constitutes the majority of the province&#x27;s land use (50.32% ), followed by agricultural land (44.77%), fishing grounds (2.42%), non-agricultural land (1.16%), &quot;other bodies of water&quot; (1.02%), and fishponds (0.31%).

Five major soil types are found within the province, the majority of which is classified as &quot;Mountain Soil&quot; (71%), followed by &quot;Sandy Loam&quot; (12.036%), &quot;Silty Clay Loam&quot; (4.880%), &quot;Clay Loam&quot; (4.612%) and &quot;Loamy Sand&quot; (0.185).

===Climate===
The climate of Sultan Kudarat falls under Type IV of Climate (characterized by rain showers or evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year). Heavy rainfall occurs from April to November. Unlike most other provinces in the country, Sultan Kudarat is generally free from typhoons as it is situated outside the &quot;typhoon belt&quot;.

The average temperature is , with as the average maximum normally occurring in March. The lowest recorded was in the Kulaman area from December to early January.

===Administrative divisions===
Sultan Kudarat comprises 11 municipalities and 1 city. Three of the municipalities (Kalamansig, Lebak, and Palimbang) are coastal towns, while the rest of the province is located inland. The 11 municipalities and Tacurong City are further subdivided into 249 barangays.

Tacurong City is the smallest unit in the province by land area, but is the most urbanized and is considered the province&#x27;s commercial center. Other growth centers are Lebak and Isulan, the latter being the provincial capital.



==Demographics==
The population of Sultan Kudarat in the 2020 census was 854,052 people, with a density of .

At the 2000 census, the province had a total population of 586,505 inhabitants, which grew to 747,087 in the 2010 census. About 113 ethnic groups were identified in the province in the 2000 Census. The Hiligaynons constitute the majority of the population, with Hiligaynon being the province&#x27;s most widely spoken language. Other languages spoken in the province are Maguindanaon, Karay-a, Dulangan Manobo, Blaan, Teduray, Ilocano, and Cebuano. Filipino and English are also widely understood and used in education, business, and administration as the national official languages, the former serving as dominant language in local media and of everyday communication of speakers of different languages, making it a secondary lingua franca in the province.

Aside from the Hiligaynons, who settled in Sultan Kudarat around the 17th to 18th centuries along with the Karay-as, whereas their fellow new settlers from Visayas continued until the Philippine independence, other ethnic groups in the province include the Maguindanaons (who constitute the majority of the provincial Muslim population), as well as the Manobos, Tedurays and Blaans, the three autochthonous ethnic groups of the province. Ilocanos and Cebuanos meanwhile are relative newcomers to the province, with the former comprising the majority of the population in the towns of Lambayong and President Quirino, and the latter in the town of Kalamansig.

===Religion===
The four major religious groups in Sultan Kudarat are Islam (48.37%), Catholic (30.27%), Iglesia ni Cristo (2.05%), and Seventh-day Adventists (1.49%). Other Christian groups constitute most of the remainders such as the Evangelical Christians, United Church of Christ in the Philippines, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, United Methodist Church, Southern Baptists, as well as &quot;tribal religions&quot;.
In 2015 the Philippine Statistics Authority recorded Islam followed by 29.48% of the population.

==Economy==

The economy of Sultan Kudarat is predominantly agricultural. The leading crops produced in the province are rice, corn, coconuts, coffee, bananas, mangoes, durians and African palm. The province is self-sufficient in poultry, swine and root crops, and is one of the few producers of Irish potatoes in the Philippines. The southern Philippines Grain Complex in Tacurong is the largest grains-processing complex in the country. There are more than 200 rice mills in the province.

Fishing is an industry in the three coastal towns of the province (Kalamansig, Lebak and Palimbang). Tuna caught along the coasts along the Celebes Sea are exported to Japan and Europe.

Other economic activities include cottage industries, which include crafts made of rattan, coconut shells, coir, driftwood and other types of wood.

Metallic minerals, which include copper, gold and silver, are found within the mountainous areas of Isulan, Bagumbayan, Sen. Ninoy Aquino, Palimbang and Columbio. Non-metallic minerals which include sand, gravel and marbleized limestone are also found in the province.

==Education==
For the school year 2009–2010, the province has 475 schools (401 public and 74 private), 368 of which were elementary schools, 90 were secondary, and 17 were tertiary. Sultan Kudarat State University is the only public tertiary school within the province, 
with its main campus at Tacurong City. Its other campuses are situated in Bagumbayan, Isulan, Kalamansig, Lutayan, Palimbang, and Senator Ninoy Aquino.

==Health facilities==

In 2010, Sultan Kudarat had 27 hospitals (5 government-owned, 22 private and 1 mobile hospital), which are classified into 17 primary
(6-25 beds capacity), 8 secondary (25-100 beds capacity) and 2 tertiary (over 100 beds capacity). Tacurong had the most number of hospitals in the province with 11, followed by Isulan with 5.

==Transportation==
As of 2010, the provincial road network spanned a total length of of which 49.26% were barangay roads, 27.97% provincial roads, 13.51% municipal/city roads and 9.25% national roads. Bagumbayan had the longest road network at , while Lutayan had the shortest at .

Sultan Kudarat has two seaports: the &quot;Port of Lebak&quot; in Kalamansig and the &quot;San Roque Port&quot; in Palimbang, and four airports (2 government-owned: Lebak Municipal Airport and President Quirino Airport, and 2 privately owned: Kalamansig Airport and Kenram Airport).

<doc id="297385" wikidata="Q54504" url="?curid=297385" title="Port Jackson">
<text>Port Jackson, commonly known as Sydney Harbour, consisting of the waters of Sydney Harbour, Middle Harbour, North Harbour and the Lane Cove and Parramatta Rivers, is the ria or natural harbour of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The harbour is an inlet of the Tasman Sea (part of the South Pacific Ocean). It is the location of the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge. The location of the first European settlement and colony on the Australian mainland, Port Jackson has continued to play a key role in the history and development of Sydney.

Port Jackson, in the early days of the colony, was also used as a shorthand for Sydney and its environs. Thus, many botanists, see, e.g., Robert Brown&#x27;s &quot;Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen&quot;, described their specimens as having been collected at Port Jackson.

Many recreational events are based on or around the harbour itself, particularly Sydney New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations. The harbour is also the starting point of the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race.

The waterways of Port Jackson are managed by Transport for NSW. Sydney Harbour National Park protects a number of islands and foreshore areas, swimming spots, bushwalking tracks and picnic areas. The harbour is a global hotspot for marine and estuarine
diversity.

==History==


At the time of the European arrival and colonisation, the land around Port Jackson was inhabited by the Eora clans, including the Gadigal, Cammeraygal, and Wangal. The Gadigal inhabited the land stretching along the south side of Port Jackson from what is now South Head, in an arc west to the present Darling Harbour. The Cammeraygal lived on the northern side of the harbour. The area along the southern banks of the Parramatta River to Rose Hill belonged to the Wangal. The Eora inhabited Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), south to the Georges River and west to Parramatta.

===Cook&#x27;s naming of Port Jackson===
The first recorded European discovery of Sydney Harbour was by Lieutenant James Cook in 1770. Cook named the inlet after Sir George Jackson, one of the Lords Commissioners of the British Admiralty, and Judge Advocate of the Fleet. As the &quot;Endeavour&quot; sailed past the entrance at Sydney Heads, Cook wrote in his journal &quot;at noon we were...about 2 or 3 miles from the land and abrest of a bay or harbour within there appeared to be a safe anchorage which I called Port Jackson.&quot;

===First Fleet===
Eighteen years later, Port Jackson saw the arrival of the First Fleet. On 21 January 1788, after arriving at Botany Bay, Governor Arthur Phillip took a longboat and two cutters up the coast to sound the entrance and examine Cook&#x27;s Port Jackson. Phillip first stayed overnight at Camp Cove, just inside the South Head, then moved up the harbour, landing at Sydney Cove and then Manly Cove, before returning to Botany Bay on the afternoon of 24 January. Phillip returned to Sydney Cove in HM Armed Tender &quot;Supply&quot; on 26 January 1788, where he established the first colony in Australia, later to become the city of Sydney. In his first dispatch from the colony back to England, Governor Phillip noted that:
Port Jackson was described as a &quot;capacious harbour, equal, if not superior to any yet known in the world&quot;, that &quot;sheltered anchorage for the ships&quot; and provided &quot;a suitable landing place on rocks on the western side of the cove, relatively level land at the head of the cove, and a run of fresh water&quot;, in addition to it being &quot;capable of affording security to a much larger fleet than would probably ever seek for shelter or security in it.&quot; Royal Navy officer David Blackburn also described it as a &quot;fine Harbour as Any in the World, with water for any Number of the Largest ships.&quot;

===Later events===

The Great White Fleet, the United States Navy battle fleet, arrived in Port Jackson in August 1908 by order of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. From 1938, seaplanes landed in Sydney Harbour on Rose Bay, making this Sydney&#x27;s first international airport.

===Attack on Sydney Harbour===
In 1942, to protect Sydney Harbour from a submarine attack, the Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net was constructed. It spanned the harbour from Green (Laings) Point, Watsons Bay to the battery at Georges Head, on the other side of the harbour. On the night of 31 May 1942, three Japanese midget submarines entered the harbour, one of which became entangled in the western end of the boom net&#x27;s central section. Unable to free their submarine, the crew detonated charges, killing themselves in the process. A second midget submarine came to grief in Taylor&#x27;s Bay, the two crew committing suicide. The third submarine fired two torpedoes at USS &quot;Chicago&quot; (both missed) before leaving the harbour. In November 2006, this submarine was found off Sydney&#x27;s Northern Beaches.

The anti-submarine boom net was demolished soon after World War II, and all that remains are the foundations of the old boom net winch house, which can be viewed on Green (Laings) Point, Watsons Bay. Today, the Australian War Memorial has on display a composite of the two midget submarines salvaged from Sydney Harbour. The conning tower of one of the midget submarines is on display at the RAN Heritage Centre, Garden Island, Sydney.

===Fortifications===

Fort Denison is a former penal site and defensive facility occupying a small island located north-east of the Royal Botanic Garden in Sydney Harbour.

There are fortifications at Sydney Heads and elsewhere, some of which are now heritage listed. The earliest date from the 1830s, and were designed to defend Sydney from seaborn attack or convict uprisings. There are four historical fortifications located between Taronga Zoo and Middle Head, Mosman, they are: the Middle Head Fortifications, the Georges Head Battery, the Lower Georges Heights Commanding Position and a small fort located on Bradleys Head, known as the Bradleys Head Fortification Complex. The forts were built from sandstone quarried on site and consist of various tunnels, underground rooms, open batteries and casemated batteries, shell rooms, gunpowder magazines, barracks and trenches.

==Geography==


Geologically, Port Jackson is a drowned river valley, or ria. It is 19 km long with an area of 55 km2. The estuary&#x27;s volume at high tide is 562 million cubic metres. The perimeter of the estuary is 317 kilometres.

According to the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales, Port Jackson is &quot;a harbour which comprises all the waters within an imaginary line joining North Head and South Head. Within this harbour lies North Harbour, Middle Harbour and Sydney Harbour.&quot;

Port Jackson extends westward from the single entrance known as Sydney Heads (North and South Heads) and encompasses all tidal waters within North Harbour, Middle Harbour, Sydney Harbour, Darling Harbour, Parramatta River and Lane Cove River.

The harbour is heavily embayed. The bays on the south side tend to be wide and rounded, whereas those on the north side are generally narrow inlets. Many of these bays include beaches. The Sydney central business district extends from Circular Quay.

=== Headlands and peninsulas ===

East to west, north side:

* North Head
* Dobroyd Head
* Middle Head
* Georges Head
* Bradleys Head
* Cremorne Point
* Kurraba Point
* Kirribilli
* McMahons Point
* Balls Head
* Berry Island

East to west, south side

* South Head
* Point Piper
* Darling Point
* Potts Point
* Bennelong Point
* Dawes Point
* Millers Point
* Pyrmont 
* Balmain
===Islands===
There are several islands within the harbour, including Shark Island, Clark Island, Fort Denison, Goat Island, Cockatoo Island, Spectacle Island, Snapper Island and Rodd Island. Some other former islands, including Garden Island, Glebe Island and Berry Island, have been linked to the shore by land reclamation, though their names often still contain the word &quot;island&quot;. Two other former islands, Bennelong Island and Darling Island, are similarly now linked to the mainland, but rarely mentioned as islands. The former Dawes Island was joined to another small island to create Spectacle Island. Exposed at low tide is Sow and Pigs Reef, a well-known navigation obstacle near the main shipping lane.

===Tributaries and waterways===
* Tank Stream was a freshwater course emptying into Sydney Cove. Today it is little more than a stormwater drain but originally it was the fresh water supply for the fledgling colony of New South Wales. It originated from a swamp to the west of present-day Hyde Park and at high tide entered Sydney Cove at the intersection of Bridge and Pitt Streets.
* Middle Harbour is the northern arm of Port Jackson. It begins as a small creek (Middle Harbour Creek) at St Ives. It joins the main waterway between two headlands, Middle Head and Grotto Point Reserve, west of Sydney Heads.
* Parramatta River is the western arm of Port Jackson. The river begins at the confluence of Toongabbie Creek and Darling Mills Creek west of Parramatta and joins the main waterway between Greenwich Point, Greenwich, and Robinsons Point, Birchgrove.
* Lane Cove River rises near Thornleigh and flows generally south for about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi). Its catchment area is approximately 95.4 square kilometres (36.8 sq mi).
* Tarban Creek, a northern tributary of the Parramatta River, enters Port Jackson at Hunters Hill.
* Johnstons Creek rises in Stanmore and flows in a generally northward direction, passing through the inner-western suburbs of Forest Lodge, Annandale and Glebe. The creek passes beneath the stands of the now demolished Harold Park Paceway prior to emptying into Rozelle Bay at Bicentennial Park, Glebe. Orphan School Creek is a tributary.
* Duck River is a perennial stream and southern tributary of the Parramatta River.

===Climate===
Port Jackson has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with warm, somewhat humid summers and mild to cool winters, with moderate rainfall spread throughout the year. Due to its exposed proximity to the Tasman Sea, it is slightly cooler, wetter and windier than Observatory Hill to the west. In addition to featuring the lowest maximum summer temperatures in the Sydney region (averaging just 24.4 °C (75.9 °F)), Port Jackson is also least affected by extreme heat due to frequent sea breezes. Conversely, winter nights are among the warmest in Sydney, and rarely dip below , although fog often occurs and may be disruptive. 

Port Jackson&#x27;s weather station is located within a lighthouse just south of Georges Head at Georges Heights in Mosman and is adjacent to the suburbs of Vaucluse, Point Piper and Watsons Bay, which are on Port Jackson&#x27;s east side towards the Pacific Ocean. Sydney Cove, a bay in Port Jackson&#x27;s west side that includes Circular Quay, is more proximate to the Observatory Hill weather station, and therefore the climate data below does not apply to that vicinity.
==Infrastructure==
===Bridges===

Port Jackson is bridged from north to south by the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Gladesville Bridge, the Ryde Bridge, and the Silverwater Bridge.

Other bridges spanning Port Jackson waterways are Pyrmont Bridge spanning Darling Harbour; the Anzac Bridge (formerly known as the Glebe Island Bridge), spanning Blackwattle Bay; the Iron Cove Bridge spanning Iron Cove; the Spit Bridge spanning Middle Harbour; the Roseville Bridge spanning Middle Harbour; the Tarban Creek Bridge spanning Tarban Creek.

The original Meadowbank Railway Bridge carried the Main Northern railway line, now reduced to pedestrian traffic only. The replacement John Whitton Bridge carries two railway tracks with piers suitable for four tracks.

There is a double track light rail bridge on the Parramatta Light Rail crossing the Parramatta River near Camellia.

Bennelong Bridge over Homebush Bay connects Wentworth Point and Rhodes

=== Punts ===

* Mortlake Ferry

=== Weir ===
A weir between Queens Avenue and Charles Street, Parramatta, called Charles Street Weir, separates the saltwater and tidal waters to the east from the freshwater and non-tidal waters to the west. The weir is marked right near the western (left) edge of the detailed map above.

===Tunnels===
A road tunnel, the Sydney Harbour Tunnel passing underneath the Harbour to the east of the bridge was opened in August 1992.

In 2005, 2010 and in 2014, the NSW Government proposed a rail tunnel be constructed to the west of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Construction of a pair of rail tunnels to the west of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, as part of the Sydney Metro project, was approved in January 2017 while the Harbour tunnelling was completed in March 2020. The line opened on 19 August 2024.

The Western Harbour Tunnel is planned to offer another motor vehicle tunnel in 2026.

===Cruise ship terminals===
Permanent cruise ship terminals are located at the Overseas Passenger Terminal at Circular Quay, Sydney Cove and at the White Bay Cruise Terminal at White Bay. White Bay&#x27;s evolution to a cruise terminal came with the closure of Darling Harbour terminal to make way for the Barangaroo development.

===Other port facilities===
White Bay and adjacent Glebe Island have been working ports since the mid-1800s, handling just about everything from timber and paper, coal, sugar and cement to cars and containers. The NSW Government identified both as vital to the City&#x27;s economy and in March 2013 announced its commitment to maintaining both as working ports as it frees up neighbouring bays for public access. Glebe Island is Sydney&#x27;s last remaining deepwater port able to supply the City&#x27;s ongoing demand for dry bulk goods such as sugar, gypsum and cement.

Most of Sydney&#x27;s port infrastructure has moved south to Botany Bay since the construction of the first container terminals there in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

==Maritime transport==

Sydney Ferries operate services from Circular Quay to Cockatoo Island, Double Bay, Manly, Mosman, Neutral Bay, Parramatta, Pyrmont Bay, Taronga Zoo and Watsons Bay.

Water taxi and water limousine operators offer transport not restricted by timetables or specific routes, and can also provide a service to or from private wharfs and houses on the waterfront. Sightseeing harbour cruises are operated daily from Circular Quay. Whale watching excursions are also operated from Port Jackson.

The Mortlake Ferry, also known as the Putney Punt, crosses the Parramatta River, connecting Mortlake and Putney.

==Maritime heritage==

Australian National Maritime Museum, at Darling Harbour, has themed exhibitions ranging from Indigenous lore and European seafaring to aquatic sport and maritime defence.

Sydney Heritage Fleet is a largely volunteer organisation dedicated to the restoration and operation of heritage vessels. The barque &quot;James Craig&quot; of the SHF sails regularly from Port Jackson.

RAN Heritage Centre at Garden Island has many exhibits, artefacts and documents relating to the history of the Royal Australian Navy.

Port Jackson is associated with the voyages of Richard Siddins.

==Ecology==
The Sydney Institute of Marine Science (SIMS) has done a great deal of work focused on habitat restoration and restoring the biodiversity of the harbour, including a major program called the Sydney Harbour Research Program around 2012, led by Emma Johnston. Project Restore is an ongoing large-scale project by SIMS and its partner universities that aims to restore different habitat types at the same time, to restore seascapes in Sydney Harbour. It encompasses four projects already under way, including the &quot;Living Seawalls&quot; project, which entails covering parts of the harbour seawalls with specially-designed tiles that mimic natural microhabitats - with crevices and other features that more closely resemble natural rocks. Project Restore is partly funded by the NSW Government.

== Heritage listings ==
Port Jackson has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Fort Denison
* Goat Island
* SS &quot;South Steyne&quot;
* Bradleys Head: Bradleys Head Light Tower

==Derivative unit of measure==
A Sydharb is a unit of volume used in Australia for water, especially in dams and harbours. One sydharb (or sydarb), also called a &quot;Sydney Harbour&quot;, is the amount of water in the Sydney Harbour (Port Jackson): approximately .

Sarangani is part of the South Cotabato-Cotabato-Sultan Kudarat-Sarangani-General Santos (Soccsksargen) development cluster, and is linked by paved roads to the international airport and harbor of General Santos.

The province is divided into two sections, separated by the Sarangani Bay and the city of General Santos, and it used to be part of South Cotabato until it was made an independent province in 1992.

The General Santos Metropolitan Area or Metro General Santos is a metropolitan area encompassing the highly urbanized city of General Santos, The Regional Agro-Industrial Center of Alabel, the towns of Glan, Kiamba, Maasin, Maitum, Malapatan and Malungon and the neighboring provinces of South Cotabato adding Metro General Santos adding Lake Sebu, Polomolok, T&#x27;Boli and Tupi.

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest civilization in the province can be found in Maitum, Sarangani, where the Maitum Anthropomorphic Pottery or Maitum Jars were found. The jars have been dated to approximately 5 BC to 370 AD, one of the oldest in the entire Southeast Asian region and the Philippines. The discovery testified to the long history of cultural exchanges in Sarangani and its people.

The Sarangani was once part of Sultanate of Maguindanao. The establishment of the Sultanate in the area caused more Maguindanaon settlers arrival. After the fall of the Sultanate of Maguindanao as a great power in Mindanao, Datu Uto of Buayan expanded his domain towards Sarangani Bay. Sarangani would eventually be under the Sultanate of Buayan until the American era.

===Spanish colonial era===
Sarangani Island (now part of Davao Occidental) was named by the Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos in 1543, in honor of Antonio de Mendoza y Pacheco, the viceroy of New Spain who had appointed López de Villalobos to lead an expedition to the Western Islands (now the Philippines) because of their relation by marriage. The early inhabitants who first inhabited Sarangani were the indigenous natives, called &quot;MunaTo&quot;, a native term for &quot;first people.&quot;

===Japanese occupation era===
In 1942, the Japanese troops occupied Southern Cotabato. In 1945, Filipino troops of the 6th, 10th, 101st and 102nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 10th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary entered in and liberated Southern Cotabato and fought against the Japanese Imperial Army forces during the Battle of Cotabato at the end of World War II under the Japanese Occupation.

===Philippine independence===
Before its inception in 1992, Sarangani was part of South Cotabato under its third district. The province was created by Republic Act No. 7228 on March 16, 1992, penned by Congressman James Chiongbian, who would later become the province&#x27;s first representative to the House of Representatives. His wife, Priscilla Chiongbian, became the first Governor of Sarangani.

==Geography==
Sarangani covers a total area of occupying the southern tip of the Soccsksargen in central Mindanao. The province is bordered on the central-north by South Cotabato, northeast by Davao del Sur, east by Davao Occidental, south by the Sarangani Bay and Celebes Sea, and northwest by Sultan Kudarat.

Sarangani is divided into two (eastern and western) sections, separated by the Sarangani Bay and General Santos in the middle. The western portion comprises the towns of Maitum, Kiamba, and Maasim, and is bounded on the north by South Cotabato and on the northwest by Sultan Kudarat. The eastern section consists of Alabel, Glan, Malapatan, and Malungon.

===Administrative divisions===
Sarangani comprises seven municipalities. A single legislative district encompasses all towns.

==Demographics==
The population of Sarangani in the 2020 census was 558,946 people, with a density of .

===Religion===

Christianity is the majority religion in the province with a total of 79% (48% Roman Catholicism and 31% evangelicals). Other religious minorities are Islam (9%) and Iglesia ni Cristo (2%). The remainder is usually divided among other Christian churches.

==Economy==

Coconut, corn, rice, banana, mango, durian, rubber, and sugarcane are major crops now being planted by the inhabitants. 
The province has plantations (mango, banana, pineapple, asparagus), cattle ranches, and commercial fishponds that have been operating in the area, some of which having existed as far back as 40 years.

Electricity comes from the National Power Corporation, and augmented by a 50 MW power plant in Alabel, the province&#x27;s capital. Water is provided for by sustainable spring development projects.

<text>Phylogeography is the study of the historical processes that may be responsible for the past to present geographic distributions of genealogical lineages. This is accomplished by considering the geographic distribution of individuals in light of genetics, particularly population genetics.

This term was introduced to describe geographically structured genetic signals within and among species. An explicit focus on a species&#x27; biogeography/biogeographical past sets phylogeography apart from classical population genetics and phylogenetics.

Past events that can be inferred include population expansion, population bottlenecks, vicariance, dispersal, and migration. Recently developed approaches integrating coalescent theory or the genealogical history of alleles and distributional information can more accurately address the relative roles of these different historical forces in shaping current patterns.

==Historical development==
The term phylogeography was first used by John Avise in his 1987 work &quot;Intraspecific Phylogeography: The Mitochondrial DNA Bridge Between Population Genetics and Systematics&quot;. Historical biogeography is a synthetic discipline that addresses how historical, geological, climatic and ecological conditions influenced the past and current distribution of species. As part of historical biogeography, researchers had been evaluating the geographical and evolutionary relationships of organisms years before. Two developments during the 1960s and 1970s were particularly important in laying the groundwork for modern phylogeography; the first was the spread of cladistic thought, and the second was the development of plate tectonics theory.

The resulting school of thought was vicariance biogeography, which explained the origin of new lineages through geological events like the drifting apart of continents or the formation of rivers. When a continuous population (or species) is divided by a new river or a new mountain range (i.e., a vicariance event), two populations (or species) are created. Paleogeography, geology and paleoecology are all important fields that supply information that is integrated into phylogeographic analyses.

Phylogeography takes a population genetics and phylogenetic perspective on biogeography. In the mid-1970s, population genetic analyses turned to mitochondrial markers. The advent of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the process where millions of copies of a DNA segment can be replicated, was crucial in the development of phylogeography.

Thanks to this breakthrough, the information contained in mitochondrial DNA sequences was much more accessible. Advances in both laboratory methods (e.g. capillary DNA sequencing technology) that allowed easier sequencing of DNA and computational methods that make better use of the data (e.g. employing coalescent theory) have helped improve phylogeographic inference. By 2000, Avise generated a seminal review of the topic in book form, in which he defined phylogeography as the study of the &quot;principles and processes governing the geographic distributions of genealogical lineages... within and among closely related species.&quot;

Early phylogeographic work has recently been criticized for its narrative nature and lack of statistical rigor (i.e. it did not statistically test alternative hypotheses). The only real method was Alan Templeton&#x27;s Nested Clade Analysis, which made use of an inference key to determine the validity of a given process in explaining the concordance between geographic distance and genetic relatedness. Recent approaches have taken a stronger statistical approach to phylogeography than was done initially.

Example

Climate change, such as the glaciation cycles of the past 2.4 million years, has periodically restricted some species into disjunct refugia. These restricted ranges may result in population bottlenecks that reduce genetic variation. Once a reversal in climate change allows for rapid migration out of refugial areas, these species spread rapidly into newly available habitat. A number of empirical studies find genetic signatures of both animal and plant species that support this scenario of refugia and postglacial expansion. This has occurred both in the tropics (where the main effect of glaciation is increasing aridity, i.e. the expansion of savanna and retraction of tropical rainforest) as well as temperate regions that were directly influenced by glaciers.

==In conservation==
Phylogeography can help in the prioritization of areas of high value for conservation. Phylogeographic analyses have also played an important role in defining evolutionary significant units (ESU), a unit of conservation below the species level that is often defined on unique geographic distribution and mitochondrial genetic patterns.

A recent study on imperiled cave crayfish in the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America demonstrates how phylogenetic analyses along with geographic distribution can aid in recognizing conservation priorities. Using phylogeographical approaches, the authors found that hidden within what was thought to be a single, widely distributed species, an ancient and previously undetected species was also present. Conservation decisions can now be made to ensure that both lineages received protection. Results like this are not an uncommon outcome from phylogeographic studies.

An analysis of salamanders of the genus &quot;Eurycea&quot;, also in the Appalachians, found that the current taxonomy of the group greatly underestimated species level diversity. The authors of this study also found that patterns of phylogeographic diversity were more associated with historical (rather than modern) drainage connections, indicating that major shifts in the drainage patterns of the region played an important role in the generation of diversity of these salamanders. A thorough understanding of phylogeographic structure will thus allow informed choices in prioritizing areas for conservation.

==Comparing phylogenetic relationships==
The field of comparative phylogeography seeks to explain the mechanisms responsible for the phylogenetic relationships and distribution of &quot;different&quot; species. For example, comparisons across multiple taxa can clarify the histories of biogeographical regions. For example, phylogeographic analyses of terrestrial vertebrates on the Baja California peninsula and marine fish on both the Pacific and gulf sides of the peninsula display genetic signatures that suggest a vicariance event affected multiple taxa during the Pleistocene or Pliocene.

Phylogeography also gives an important historical perspective on community composition. History is relevant to regional and local diversity in two ways. One, the size and makeup of the regional species pool results from the balance of speciation and extinction. Two, at a local level community composition is influenced by the interaction between local extinction of species’ populations and recolonization. A comparative phylogenetic approach in the Australian Wet Tropics indicates that regional patterns of species distribution and diversity are largely determined by local extinctions and subsequent recolonizations corresponding to climatic cycles.

Phylogeography integrates biogeography and genetics to study in greater detail the lineal history of a species in context of the geoclimatic history of the planet. An example study of poison frogs living in the South American neotropics (illustrated to the left) is used to demonstrate how phylogeographers combine genetics and paleogeography to piece together the ecological history of organisms in their environments. Several major geoclimatic events have greatly influenced the biogeographic distribution of organisms in this area, including the isolation and reconnection of South America, the uplift of the Andes, an extensive Amazonian floodbasin system during the Miocene, the formation of Orinoco and Amazon drainages, and dry−wet climate cycles throughout the Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs.

Using this contextual paleogeographic information (paleogeographic time series is shown in panels A-D) the authors of this study proposed a null-hypothesis that assumes no spatial structure and two alternative hypothesis involving dispersal and other biogeographic constraints (hypothesis are shown in panels E-G, listed as SMO, SM1, and SM2). The phylogeographers visited the ranges of each frog species to obtain tissue samples for genetic analysis; researchers can also obtain tissue samples from museum collections.

The evolutionary history and relations among different poison frog species is reconstructed using phylogenetic trees derived from molecular data. The molecular trees are mapped in relation to paleogeographic history of the region for a complete phylogeographic study. The tree shown in the center of the figure has its branch lengths calibrated to a molecular clock, with the geological time bar shown at the bottom. The same phylogenetic tree is duplicated four more times to show where each lineage is distributed and is found (illustrated in the inset maps below, including Amazon basin, Andes, Guiana-Venezuela, Central America-Chocó).

The combination of techniques used in this study exemplifies more generally how phylogeographic studies proceed and test for patterns of common influence. Paleogeographic data establishes geological time records for historical events that explain the branching patterns in the molecular trees. This study rejected the null model and found that the origin for all extant Amazonian poison frog species primarily stem from fourteen lineages that dispersed into their respective areas after the Miocene floodbasin receded. Regionally based phylogeographic studies of this type are repeated for different species as a means of independent testing. Phylogeographers find broadly concordant and repeated patterns among species in most regions of the planet that is due to a common influence of paleoclimatic history.

==In humans==

Phylogeography has also proven to be useful in understanding the origin and dispersal patterns of our own species, &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Based primarily on observations of skeletal remains of ancient human remains and estimations of their age, anthropologists proposed two competing hypotheses about human origins.

The first hypothesis is referred to as the Out-of-Africa with replacement model, which contends that the last expansion out of Africa around 100,000 years ago resulted in the modern humans displacing all previous &quot;Homo&quot; spp. populations in Eurasia that were the result of an earlier wave of emigration out of Africa. The multiregional scenario claims that individuals from the recent expansion out of Africa intermingled genetically with those human populations of more ancient African emigrations. 
A phylogeographic study that uncovered a Mitochondrial Eve that lived in Africa 150,000 years ago provided early support for the Out-of-Africa model.

While this study had its shortcomings, it received significant attention both within scientific circles and a wider audience. A more thorough phylogeographic analysis that used ten different genes instead of a single mitochondrial marker indicates that at least two major expansions out of Africa after the initial range extension of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; played an important role shaping the modern human gene pool and that recurrent genetic exchange is pervasive. These findings strongly demonstrated Africa&#x27;s central role in the evolution of modern humans, but also indicated that the multiregional model had some validity. These studies have largely been supplanted by population genomic studies that use orders of magnitude more data.

In light of these recent data from the 1000 genomes project, genomic-scale SNP databases sampling thousands of individuals globally and samples taken from two non-Homo sapiens hominins (Neanderthals and Denisovans), the picture of human evolutionary has become more resolved and complex involving possible Neanderthal and Denisovan admixture, admixture with archaic African hominins, and Eurasian expansion into the Australasian region that predates the standard out of African expansion.

==In viruses==
Viruses are informative in understanding the dynamics of evolutionary change due to their rapid mutation rate and fast generation time. Phylogeography is a useful tool in understanding the origins and distributions of different viral strains. A phylogeographic approach has been taken for many diseases that threaten human health, including dengue fever, rabies, influenza and HIV. Similarly, a phylogeographic approach will likely play a key role in understanding the vectors and spread of avian influenza (HPAI H5N1), demonstrating the relevance of phylogeography to the general public.

==Of languages==
Phylogeographic analysis of ancient and modern languages has been used to test whether Indo-European languages originated in Anatolia or in the steppes of Central Asia. Language evolution was modeled in terms of the gain and loss of cognate words in each language over time, to produce a cladogram of related languages. Combining those data with known geographic ranges of each language produced strong support for an Anatolian origin approximately 8000–9500 years ago.

<text>Charles Norris Poulson (July 23, 1895 – September 25, 1982) was an American politician who represented Southern California in public office at the local, state, and federal levels. He served as the 36th Mayor of Los Angeles from 1953 to 1961, after having been a California State Assemblyman and then a member of the United States Congress. He was a Republican.

==Early life and career==
Charles Norris Poulson was born in Baker County, Oregon. He was the son of Peter Skovo Poulson (1843–1928), an immigrant from Denmark. Poulson attended Oregon State University for two years before he wed Erna June Loennig on December 25, 1916. The couple arrived in Los Angeles in 1923. Poulson became a certified public accountant through correspondence classes and night school at Southwestern Law School, which at that time had a business school.

==Political career==

===California State Assembly and U.S. Congress===
In 1938, he was elected to the District 56 seat of the California State Assembly. He won a congressional seat four years later. After losing the seat in the 1944 election, he returned to the United States Congress following the 1946 elections, remaining there until his election as mayor of Los Angeles. During his years as a congressman, Poulson helped lead California in its fight against Arizona over Colorado River water. At the time of his departure from Congress, he was the chairman of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs.

===Mayor of Los Angeles===

Poulson&#x27;s victory in the Los Angeles mayoral race came after a contentious battle in which his opponent, incumbent mayor Fletcher Bowron, claimed that the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wanted to control city government and, by endorsing Poulson, would have a puppet in the mayor&#x27;s office. Poulson, for his part, challenged Bowron&#x27;s support for public housing, in particular a project in the area known as Chavez Ravine in Elysian Park Heights (the site on which Dodger Stadium would later be built). With the support of the group Citizens Against Socialist Housing (CASH) and drawing on the anti-communist atmosphere of the time, Poulson promised to end support for such &quot;un-American&quot; housing projects and to fire city employees who were communists or who refused to answer questions about their political activities.

During his eight years as mayor, Los Angeles became the third largest city in the United States, with Poulson instrumental in leading the construction of Los Angeles International Airport and expanding the Los Angeles Harbor. Most notably, he led the drive to lure baseball&#x27;s Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles. This led to what became known as the Battle of Chavez Ravine, which resulted in the removal of Hispanic residents from land on which Dodger Stadium was later constructed. He helped integrate the city&#x27;s fire and police departments and initiated a garbage recycling program that proved to be a factor in his defeat in 1961.

In 1958 and 1959, Paulson served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors.

Perhaps the most memorable image of his mayoral career came on September 21, 1959, when he addressed Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev during a public ceremony. The comments came after Khrushchev had constantly touted Soviet superiority during his tour of the city by Poulson. Citing Khrushchev&#x27;s phrase, &quot;We will bury you,&quot; Poulson responded, &quot;You shall not bury us and we shall not bury you. We tell you in the friendliest terms possible we are planning no funerals, yours or our own.&quot; Poulson received over 3,600 letters following the incident, many of them praising him for his comments.

He lost a reelection campaign in 1961 to Sam Yorty, partly due to having to explain the expenses incurred by the Dodgers&#x27; franchise shift. Efforts to blunt such criticism were limited due to a severe case of laryngitis, which prevented him from responding to the invitation from local television personality George Putnam to debate Yorty on his show. Poulson did not recover from the laryngitis in time, and his campaign never recovered from the setback.
Following the defeat, Poulson briefly returned to accounting before retiring to La Jolla in San Diego in 1962. He died at a hospital in Orange, California, in 1982, after a colostomy operation. His grandson Norris Brandt is a nationally-recognized expert on water policy.
