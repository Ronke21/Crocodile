<text>In mathematics, a Coxeter group, named after H. S. M. Coxeter, is an abstract group that admits a formal description in terms of reflections (or kaleidoscopic mirrors). Indeed, the finite Coxeter groups are precisely the finite Euclidean reflection groups; for example, the symmetry group of each regular polyhedron is a finite Coxeter group. However, not all Coxeter groups are finite, and not all can be described in terms of symmetries and Euclidean reflections. Coxeter groups were introduced in 1934 as abstractions of reflection groups, and finite Coxeter groups were classified in 1935.

Coxeter groups find applications in many areas of mathematics. Examples of finite Coxeter groups include the symmetry groups of regular polytopes, and the Weyl groups of simple Lie algebras. Examples of infinite Coxeter groups include the triangle groups corresponding to regular tessellations of the Euclidean plane and the hyperbolic plane, and the Weyl groups of infinite-dimensional Kac–Moody algebras.

==Definition==
Formally, a Coxeter group can be defined as a group with the presentation

:formula_1

where formula_2 and formula_3 is either an integer or formula_4 for formula_5.
Here, the condition formula_6 means that no relation of the form formula_7 for any integer formula_8 should be imposed.

The pair formula_9 where formula_10 is a Coxeter group with generators formula_11 is called a Coxeter system. Note that in general formula_12 is &quot;not&quot; uniquely determined by formula_10. For example, the Coxeter groups of type formula_14 and formula_15 are isomorphic but the Coxeter systems are not equivalent, since the former has 3 generators and the latter has 1 + 3 = 4 generators (see below for an explanation of this notation).

A number of conclusions can be drawn immediately from the above definition.
* The relation formula_16 means that formula_17 for all formula_18 ; as such the generators are involutions.
* If formula_19, then the generators formula_20 and formula_21 commute. This follows by observing that
::formula_22,
: together with
::formula_23
: implies that
::formula_24.
:Alternatively, since the generators are involutions, formula_25, so formula_26. That is to say, the commutator of formula_20 and formula_21 is equal to 1, or equivalently that formula_20 and formula_21 commute.

The reason that formula_31 for formula_32 is stipulated in the definition is that
:formula_33,
together with
:formula_34
already implies that
:formula_35. 
An alternative proof of this implication is the observation that formula_36 and formula_37 are conjugates: indeed formula_38.

===Coxeter matrix and Schläfli matrix===
The Coxeter matrix is the formula_39 symmetric matrix with entries formula_40. Indeed, every symmetric matrix with diagonal entries exclusively 1 and nondiagonal entries in the set formula_41 is a Coxeter matrix.

The Coxeter matrix can be conveniently encoded by a Coxeter diagram, as per the following rules.
* The vertices of the graph are labelled by generator subscripts.
* Vertices formula_18 and formula_43 are adjacent if and only if formula_44.
* An edge is labelled with the value of formula_40 whenever the value is formula_46 or greater.

In particular, two generators commute if and only if they are not joined by an edge. 
Furthermore, if a Coxeter graph has two or more connected components, the associated group is the direct product of the groups associated to the individual components.
Thus the disjoint union of Coxeter graphs yields a direct product of Coxeter groups.

The Coxeter matrix, formula_47, is related to the formula_39 Schläfli matrix formula_49 with entries formula_50, but the elements are modified, being proportional to the dot product of the pairwise generators. The Schläfli matrix is useful because its eigenvalues determine whether the Coxeter group is of &quot;finite type&quot; (all positive), &quot;affine type&quot; (all non-negative, at least one zero), or &quot;indefinite type&quot; (otherwise). The indefinite type is sometimes further subdivided, e.g. into hyperbolic and other Coxeter groups. However, there are multiple non-equivalent definitions for hyperbolic Coxeter groups.

==An example==
The graph formula_51 in which vertices formula_52 through formula_53 are placed in a row with each vertex joined by an unlabelled edge to its immediate neighbors is the Coxeter diagram of the symmetric group formula_54; the generators correspond to the transpositions formula_55. Any two non-consecutive transpositions commute, while multiplying two consecutive transpositions gives a 3-cycle : formula_56. Therefore formula_54 is a quotient of the Coxeter group having Coxeter diagram formula_51. Further arguments show that this quotient map is an isomorphism.

==Abstraction of reflection groups==

Coxeter groups are an abstraction of reflection groups. Coxeter groups are &quot;abstract&quot; groups, in the sense of being given via a presentation. On the other hand, reflection groups are &quot;concrete&quot;, in the sense that each of its elements is the composite of finitely many geometric reflections about linear hyperplanes in some euclidean space. Technically, a reflection group is a subgroup of a linear group (or various generalizations) generated by orthogonal matrices of determinant -1. Each generator of a Coxeter group has order 2, which abstracts the geometric fact that performing a reflection twice is the identity. Each relation of the form formula_59, corresponding to the geometric fact that, given two hyperplanes meeting at an angle of formula_60, the composite of the two reflections about these hyperplanes is a rotation by formula_61, which has order &quot;k&quot;.

In this way, every reflection group may be presented as a Coxeter group. The converse is partially true: every finite Coxeter group admits a faithful representation as a finite reflection group of some Euclidean space.
However, not every infinite Coxeter group admits a representation as a reflection group.

Finite Coxeter groups have been classified.

==Finite Coxeter groups==
===Classification===
Finite Coxeter groups are classified in terms of their Coxeter diagrams.

The finite Coxeter groups with connected Coxeter diagrams consist of three one-parameter families of increasing dimension (formula_51 for formula_63, formula_64 for formula_65, and formula_66 for formula_67), a one-parameter family of dimension two (formula_68 for formula_69), and six exceptional groups (formula_70 and formula_71). Every finite Coxeter group is the direct product of finitely many of these irreducible groups. 

===Weyl groups===

Many, but not all of these, are Weyl groups, and every Weyl group can be realized as a Coxeter group. The Weyl groups are the families formula_72 and formula_73 and the exceptions formula_74 and formula_75 denoted in Weyl group notation as formula_76

The non-Weyl ones are the exceptions formula_77 and formula_78 and those members of the family formula_68 that are not exceptionally isomorphic to a Weyl group (namely formula_80 and formula_81).

This can be proven by comparing the restrictions on (undirected) Dynkin diagrams with the restrictions on Coxeter diagrams of finite groups: formally, the Coxeter graph can be obtained from the Dynkin diagram by discarding the direction of the edges, and replacing every double edge with an edge labelled 4 and every triple edge by an edge labelled 6. Also note that every finitely generated Coxeter group is an automatic group. Dynkin diagrams have the additional restriction that the only permitted edge labels are 2, 3, 4, and 6, which yields the above. Geometrically, this corresponds to the crystallographic restriction theorem, and the fact that excluded polytopes do not fill space or tile the plane – for formula_82 the dodecahedron (dually, icosahedron) does not fill space; for formula_78 the 120-cell (dually, 600-cell) does not fill space; for formula_68 a &quot;p&quot;-gon does not tile the plane except for formula_85 or formula_86 (the triangular, square, and hexagonal tilings, respectively).

Note further that the (directed) Dynkin diagrams &quot;Bn&quot; and &quot;Cn&quot; give rise to the same Weyl group (hence Coxeter group), because they differ as &quot;directed&quot; graphs, but agree as &quot;undirected&quot; graphs – direction matters for root systems but not for the Weyl group; this corresponds to the hypercube and cross-polytope being different regular polytopes but having the same symmetry group.

===Properties===
Some properties of the finite irreducible Coxeter groups are given in the following table. The order of a reducible group can be computed by the product of its irreducible subgroup orders.

===Symmetry groups of regular polytopes===
The symmetry group of every regular polytope is a finite Coxeter group. Note that dual polytopes have the same symmetry group.

There are three series of regular polytopes in all dimensions. The symmetry group of a regular &quot;n&quot;-simplex is the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1, also known as the Coxeter group of type &quot;An&quot;. The symmetry group of the &quot;n&quot;-cube and its dual, the &quot;n&quot;-cross-polytope, is &quot;Bn&quot;, and is known as the hyperoctahedral group.

The exceptional regular polytopes in dimensions two, three, and four, correspond to other Coxeter groups. In two dimensions, the dihedral groups, which are the symmetry groups of regular polygons, form the series &quot;I&quot;2(&quot;p&quot;), for &quot;p&quot; ≥ 3. In three dimensions, the symmetry group of the regular dodecahedron and its dual, the regular icosahedron, is &quot;H&quot;3, known as the full icosahedral group. In four dimensions, there are three exceptional regular polytopes, the 24-cell, the 120-cell, and the 600-cell. The first has symmetry group &quot;F&quot;4, while the other two are dual and have symmetry group &quot;H&quot;4.

The Coxeter groups of type &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;E&quot;6, &quot;E&quot;7, and &quot;E&quot;8 are the symmetry groups of certain semiregular polytopes.

==Affine Coxeter groups==


The affine Coxeter groups form a second important series of Coxeter groups. These are not finite themselves, but each contains a normal abelian subgroup such that the corresponding quotient group is finite. In each case, the quotient group is itself a Coxeter group, and the Coxeter graph of the affine Coxeter group is obtained from the Coxeter graph of the quotient group by adding another vertex and one or two additional edges. For example, for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2, the graph consisting of &quot;n&quot;+1 vertices in a circle is obtained from &quot;An&quot; in this way, and the corresponding Coxeter group is the affine Weyl group of &quot;An&quot; (the affine symmetric group). For &quot;n&quot; = 2, this can be pictured as a subgroup of the symmetry group of the standard tiling of the plane by equilateral triangles.

In general, given a root system, one can construct the associated &quot;Stiefel diagram&quot;, consisting of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots along with certain translates of these hyperplanes. The affine Coxeter group (or affine Weyl group) is then the group generated by the (affine) reflections about all the hyperplanes in the diagram. The Stiefel diagram divides the plane into infinitely many connected components called &quot;alcoves&quot;, and the affine Coxeter group acts freely and transitively on the alcoves, just as the ordinary Weyl group acts freely and transitively on the Weyl chambers. The figure at right illustrates the Stiefel diagram for the formula_87 root system.

Suppose formula_88 is an irreducible root system of rank formula_89 and let formula_90 be a collection of simple roots. Let, also, formula_91 denote the highest root. Then the affine Coxeter group is generated by the ordinary (linear) reflections about the hyperplanes perpendicular to formula_90, together with an affine reflection about a translate of the hyperplane perpendicular to formula_91. The Coxeter graph for the affine Weyl group is the Coxeter–Dynkin diagram for formula_88, together with one additional node associated to formula_91. In this case, one alcove of the Stiefel diagram may be obtained by taking the fundamental Weyl chamber and cutting it by a translate of the hyperplane perpendicular to formula_91.

A list of the affine Coxeter groups follows:

The group symbol subscript is one less than the number of nodes in each case, since each of these groups was obtained by adding a node to a finite group&#x27;s graph.

==Hyperbolic Coxeter groups==
There are infinitely many hyperbolic Coxeter groups describing reflection groups in hyperbolic space, notably including the hyperbolic triangle groups.

==Irreducible Coxeter groups==
A Coxeter group is said to be &quot;irreducible&quot; if its Coxeter–Dynkin diagram is connected. Every Coxeter group is the direct product of the irreducible groups that correspond to the components of its Coxeter–Dynkin diagram. 

==Partial orders==
A choice of reflection generators gives rise to a length function &quot;ℓ&quot; on a Coxeter group, namely the minimum number of uses of generators required to express a group element; this is precisely the length in the word metric in the Cayley graph. An expression for &quot;v&quot; using &quot;ℓ&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) generators is a &quot;reduced word&quot;. For example, the permutation (13) in &quot;S&quot;3 has two reduced words, (12)(23)(12) and (23)(12)(23). The function formula_97 defines a map formula_98 generalizing the sign map for the symmetric group.

Using reduced words one may define three partial orders on the Coxeter group, the (right) weak order, the absolute order and the Bruhat order (named for François Bruhat). An element &quot;v&quot; exceeds an element &quot;u&quot; in the Bruhat order if some (or equivalently, any) reduced word for &quot;v&quot; contains a reduced word for &quot;u&quot; as a substring, where some letters (in any position) are dropped. In the weak order, &quot;v&quot; ≥ &quot;u&quot; if some reduced word for &quot;v&quot; contains a reduced word for &quot;u&quot; as an initial segment. Indeed, the word length makes this into a graded poset. The Hasse diagrams corresponding to these orders are objects of study, and are related to the Cayley graph determined by the generators. The absolute order is defined analogously to the weak order, but with generating set/alphabet consisting of all conjugates of the Coxeter generators.

For example, the permutation (1 2 3) in &quot;S&quot;3 has only one reduced word, (12)(23), so covers (12) and (23) in the Bruhat order but only covers (12) in the weak order.

==Homology==
Since a Coxeter group formula_10 is generated by finitely many elements of order 2, its abelianization is an elementary abelian 2-group, i.e., it is isomorphic to the direct sum of several copies of the cyclic group formula_100. This may be restated in terms of the first homology group of formula_10.

The Schur multiplier formula_102, equal to the second homology group of formula_10, was computed in for finite reflection groups and in for affine reflection groups, with a more unified account given in . In all cases, the Schur multiplier is also an elementary abelian 2-group. For each infinite family formula_104 of finite or affine Weyl groups, the rank of formula_105 stabilizes as formula_53 goes to infinity.

*Directed by Samira Makhmalbaf
The news of the September 11, 2001 attacks reaches an Afghan refugee camp, where bricks are produced to build new shelters, in view of the attacks promised by the United States. Here a young teacher tries to explain to her young students what happened and to make them respect a minute of silence in honor of the victims. Attempts, however, fail one after another. Finally, the teacher finds herself having to impose the minute of silence on the children near a chimney (the most similar to a skyscraper).

*Directed by Claude Lelouch
New York, September 11, 2001: a young French photographer deaf-mute is a guest of her fiancé, a tour guide for disabled people who is about to bring a group to visit the Twin Towers. After she tried to explain to him that a story &quot;at a distance&quot; like theirs has no chance of succeeding, he tries to leave a message on the computer before leaving explaining that only a miracle can keep them together. At that moment he returns home covered in dust, miraculously escaping the attack.

===&quot;Egypt&quot;===
*Directed by Youssef Chahine
New York, September 10, 2001: director Yusuf Shahin is finalizing the filming of a film at the World Trade Center, but is sent away with his crew in a decisive manner by a policeman because he has no authorization to stay there. Two days later, Shahin presented himself at a press conference, but said he was upset by the attacks and asked to be able to postpone it, triggering the reaction of a journalist.

While he is on the cliff in front of the house, the ghost of a young American soldier appears to him, who died in the attack on multinational forces in Lebanon in 1983. The soldier reveals to Shahin that he is the only one who can see him, because he is the only one who can hear and understand what is going on around. The two face a &quot;journey&quot; that leads them to analyze the roots of the clash between the United States and the Arab world, starting from the house of the young Arab who was the executor material of the attack. After observing his preparation, Shahin discusses with his parents, who say they are proud of what he has done and go on to complain of the constant violence suffered by the Palestinians by Israel.

The soldier reacts by saying that, although he understands the attacks against the soldiers, it is still not right to shoot in the pile. The director counters by showing the list of victims of US military interventions and wars after the Second World War, not justifying the violence but complaining about the United States&#x27; inability to understand that the legitimate defense of their principles often goes through the destruction of other countries. Their path ends at Arlington National Cemetery, where Shahin finds his girlfriend and the young soldier&#x27;s father, who turns out to be the policeman who drove him away from the Twin Towers and with whom he reconciles. Shortly thereafter, the phantom of the attacker appears, who resolutely reproaches the director for appearing too good with that soldier. Shahin replies that both are victims of human stupidity, but the attacker responds by reiterating his position once again and showing he does not want to understand, leaving the director stunned by his uncompromising words.

Despite the attacks in New York, a girl from Srebrenica considers it appropriate to celebrate the monthly demonstration anyway, in memory of the massacre of the local population by Bosnian Serb soldiers, which took place on July 11, 1995.

*Directed by Idrissa Ouédraogo
Ouagadougou, September 2001: Adamà is a boy who is forced to leave school and work as a newsboy in order to be able to pay for medicines to his sick mother. Two weeks after the attacks, Adamà sees a man very similar to Osama bin Laden and decides to capture him with the help of his friends, in order to claim the prize of 25 million pending on his boss. The boys decide to use that money to treat Adamà&#x27;s mother and, potentially, many other sick people in the country, as well as not to say anything to the adults, to prevent them from wasting the money of the prize.

The boys steal the camera of one of their parents and start to follow &quot;Osama bin Laden&quot; to a clearing where, every day, he goes to pray. The five therefore devise a plan to capture him in that clearing, but &quot;bin Laden&quot; does not show up that day. The boys try to capture him at the hotel, but they discover that the man is now going to the airport, where they are stopped by the policeman before they could enter. In the end, the boys decide to sell the camera and give Adamà the money, so he can look after his mother and go back to school.

*Directed by Ken Loach
Pablo, a Chilean refugee in London, writes a letter to the families of the victims of the September 11 attacks, reminding them of &quot;his&quot; September 11: Chilean coup of 1973, when the general Augusto Pinochet implemented a coup d&#x27;état (backed by the US) against left-wing president Salvador Allende, democratically elected in 1970. Pablo narrates in his letter of US involvement in financing of right-wing and subversive groups, up to the coup, and of the violence and torture suffered by him and his countrymen. Forced to first five years in prison and then into exile, he declares that he can no longer return to Chile because his family and children are now born and raised in the United Kingdom. Pablo concludes his letter with the hope that, as he will unite in the memory of the victims of September 11, 2001, so they will join him in memory of the victims of September 11, 1973.

*Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu
Black screen. Background noises and rumors of everyday life, suddenly interrupted by the screams of the witnesses of the crash of flight AA11 against the North Tower of the World Trade Center. While the black screen is occasionally interrupted by the repertoire images of the attacks, the voices of the announcements on television, the screams of the victims, the explosions of the planes, the calls made by the victims and their relatives overlap. The sound stops and you can see the two towers collapse without sound. The background voices start again on a background of violins, while the screen gradually changes from black to white. Two writings appear (one in Arabic characters and one in Latin characters) of the same meaning: &quot;Does God&#x27;s light guide us or blind us?&quot; The sentences finally disappear in a blinding light.

===&quot;Israel&quot;===
*Directed by Amos Gitai
A suicide attack shakes Tel Aviv. Soldiers, policemen and doctors for various, long minutes try to coordinate the operations of security and rescue. A journalist and her crew arrive at the scene and try in every way to obtain information from the police forces present, obtaining only peremptory invitations to clear the area. At one point, the director tells the journalist that she won&#x27;t go on the air and she reacts first by protesting, then starting to rattle off various historical events that took place all on September 11. While the journalist insists on carrying out her service, the voice of the director is heard in the background telling her that something very serious happened in New York, to the point of explicitly saying &quot;remember this date, September 11th, because it is a date that nobody more will forget &quot;. Faced with the further (but now unintelligible) protests of the journalist, the director replies &quot;I&#x27;m not talking to you about September 11th of &#x27;44 or &#x27;97, I&#x27;m talking about September 11th today&quot;.

*Directed by Mira Nair
A Pakistani woman has not heard from her son Salman since the day of the attacks on the Twin Towers. CIA and FBI repeatedly question her, since they believe the young man, of Muslim faith, could be linked to the attacks. In particular, they ask many questions about why he did not show up for work that day and why, despite having decided to pursue a medical career and leave the police academy, he still held the latter&#x27;s card.

While the woman does not resign herself to the disappearance of her son, the media begin to report the news of her involvement in the attack, which does nothing but exacerbate the isolation in which the woman and the family have fallen. Only after six months, the boy&#x27;s remains are identified among those found among the rubble and the truth is re-established: it turns out that the young man died while he was helping at the site of the attacks. During the funeral, the mother denounces the climate of suspicion that has been created against her family and against the Muslim community in the United States.

*Directed by Sean Penn
An old man spends his life alone in an apartment overshadowed by the Twin Towers. The widowed man vents his loneliness by talking to his late wife as if she were still alive and cultivating her flower pot, withered by the lack of light. The collapse of the Towers finally allows the light to flood the apartment and suddenly revitalizes the flowers. The elder, happy for what happened, tries to show the vase to his wife, but the light reveals the illusion in which he lived until then. Between tears, he regrets that his wife is not there to finally see the vase bloom again.

===&quot;Japan&quot;===
*Directed by Shōhei Imamura
Japan, August 1945. Yoichi, a soldier returned from the front with post-traumatic disorder, behaves like a snake, to the dismay of his parents and his wife. His family tries to convince him to return to the &quot;human&quot; state, but without success. The other villagers begin to look at them with suspicion and fear, but this does not prevent Yoichi&#x27;s wife from having an extra-marital relationship.

While the wife and her lover talk about the traumatic experiences that the soldier must have suffered, of the new type of bomb used in the bombing of Hiroshima and the forthcoming end of the war, the situation worsens: Yoichi swallows a mouse under the horrified eyes of his mother, who decides to chase him away. In the following days, the villagers suffer the loss of various animals and everyone blames the mad soldier. It is thus decided to organize a search operation to find it, but without success. Meanwhile, a flashback clarifies the reason for the soldier&#x27;s behavior: hiding behind a boulder after a violent battle, Yoichi is beaten by a fellow soldier who asks him why he does not take part in this &quot;holy war&quot;.

During the hunt, Yoichi&#x27;s wife accidentally finds her husband drinking water from a river and asks him &quot;do you dislike being a man so much?&quot; Yoichi, in response, crawls into the water and swims away ignoring the screams of his wife. Finally, a snake is shown above a river stone, while the inscription in Japanese &quot;Holy wars do not exist&quot; appears.

<doc id="297013" wikidata="Q255912" url="?curid=297013" title="Word problem (mathematics education)">
<text>In science education, a word problem is a mathematical exercise (such as in a textbook, worksheet, or exam) where significant background information on the problem is presented in ordinary language rather than in mathematical notation. As most word problems involve a narrative of some sort, they are sometimes referred to as story problems and may vary in the amount of technical language used.

== Example ==
A typical word problem:

Tess paints two boards of a fence every four minutes, but Allie can paint three boards every two minutes. If there are 240 boards total, how many hours will it take them to paint the fence, working together?

== Solution process ==
Word problems such as the above can be examined through five stages:

* 1. Problem Comprehension
* 2. Situational Solution Visualization
* 3. Mathematical Solution Planning
* 4. Solving for Solution
* 5. Situational Solution Visualization
The linguistic properties of a word problem need to be addressed first. To begin the solution process, one must first understand what the problem is asking and what type of solution the answer will be. In the problem above, the words &quot;minutes&quot;, &quot;total&quot;, &quot;hours&quot;, and &quot;together&quot; need to be examined.

The next step is to visualize what the solution to this problem might mean. For our stated problem, the solution might be visualized by examining if the total number of hours will be greater or smaller than if it were stated in minutes. Also, it must be determined whether or not the two girls will finish at a faster or slower rate if they are working together.

After this, one must plan a solution method using mathematical terms. One scheme to analyze the mathematical properties is to classify the numerical quantities in the problem into known quantities (values given in the text), wanted quantities (values to be found), and auxiliary quantities (values found as intermediate stages of the problem). This is found in the &quot;Variables&quot; and &quot;Equations&quot; sections above.

Next, the mathematical processes must be applied to the formulated solution process. This is done solely in the mathematical context for now.

Finally, one must again visualize the proposed solution and determine if the solution seems to make sense for the realistic context of the problem. After visualizing if it is reasonable, one can then work to further analyze and draw connections between mathematical concepts and realistic problems.

The importance of these five steps in teacher education is discussed at the end of the following section.

== Purpose and skill development ==
Word problems commonly include mathematical modelling questions, where data and information about a certain system is given and a student is required to develop a model. For example:

# Jane had $5.00, then spent $2.00. How much does she have now?
# In a cylindrical barrel with radius 2 m, the water is rising at a rate of 3 cm/s. What is the rate of increase of the volume of water?

As the developmental skills of students across grade levels varies, the relevance to students and application of word problems also varies. The first example is accessible to primary school students, and may be used to teach the concept of subtraction. The second example can only be solved using geometric knowledge, specifically that of the formula for the volume of a cylinder with a given radius and height, and requires an understanding of the concept of &quot;rate&quot;.

There are numerous skills that can be developed to increase a students&#x27; understanding and fluency in solving word problems. The two major stems of these skills are cognitive skills and related academic skills. The cognitive domain consists of skills such as nonverbal reasoning and processing speed. Both of these skills work to strengthen numerous other fields of thought. Other cognitive skills include language comprehension, working memory, and attention. While these are not solely for the purpose of solving word problems, each one of them affects one&#x27;s ability to solve such mathematical problems. For instance, if the one solving the math word problem has a limited understanding of the language (English, Spanish, etc.) they are more likely to not understand what the problem is even asking. In Example 1 (above), if one does not comprehend the definition of the word &quot;spent,&quot; they will misunderstand the entire purpose of the word problem. This alludes to how the cognitive skills lead to the development of the mathematical concepts. Some of the related mathematical skills necessary for solving word problems are mathematical vocabulary and reading comprehension. This can again be connected to the example above. With an understanding of the word &quot;spent&quot; and the concept of subtraction, it can be deduced that this word problem is relating the two. This leads to the conclusion that word problems are beneficial at each level of development, despite the fact that these domains will vary across developmental and academic stages.

The discussion in this section and the previous one urge the examination of how these research findings can affect teacher education. One of the first ways is that when a teacher understands the solution structure of word problems, they are likely to have an increased understanding of their students&#x27; comprehension levels. Each of these research studies supported the finding that, in many cases, students do not often struggle with executing the mathematical procedures. Rather, the comprehension gap comes from not having a firm understanding of the connections between the math concepts and the semantics of the realistic problems. As a teacher examines a student&#x27;s solution process, understanding each of the steps will help them understand how to best accommodate their specific learning needs. Another thing to address is the importance of teaching and promoting multiple solution processes. Procedural fluency is often times taught without an emphasis on conceptual and applicable comprehension. This leaves students with a gap between their mathematical understanding and their realistic problem solving skills. The ways in which teachers can best prepare for and promote this type of learning will not be discussed here.

== History and culture ==
The modern notation that enables mathematical ideas to be expressed symbolically was developed in Europe from the sixteenth century onwards. Prior to this, all mathematical problems and solutions were written out in words; the more complicated the problem, the more laborious and convoluted the verbal explanation.

Examples of word problems can be found dating back to Babylonian times. Apart from a few procedure texts for finding things like square roots, most Old Babylonian problems are couched in a language of measurement of everyday objects and activities. Students had to find lengths of canals dug, weights of stones, lengths of broken reeds, areas of fields, numbers of bricks used in a construction, and so on.

Ancient Egyptian mathematics also has examples of word problems. The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus includes a problem that can be translated as:There are seven houses; in each house there are seven cats; each cat kills seven mice; each mouse has eaten seven grains of barley; each grain would have produced seven hekat. What is the sum of all the enumerated things?In more modern times the sometimes confusing and arbitrary nature of word problems has been the subject of satire. Gustave Flaubert wrote this nonsensical problem, now known as the Age of the captain:Since you are now studying geometry and trigonometry, I will give you a problem. A ship sails the ocean. It left Boston with a cargo of cotton. It grosses 200 tons. It is bound for Le Havre. The mainmast is broken, the cabin boy is on deck, there are 12 passengers aboard, the wind is blowing East-North-East, the clock points to a quarter past three in the afternoon. It is the month of May. How old is the captain? Word problems have also been satirised in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, when a lengthy word problem (&quot;An express train traveling 60 miles per hour leaves Santa Fe bound for Phoenix, 520 miles away. At the same time, a local train traveling 30 miles an hour carrying 40 passengers leaves Phoenix bound for Santa Fe...&quot;) trails off with a schoolboy character instead imagining that he is on the train.

Both the original British and American versions of the game show &quot;Winning Lines&quot; involve word problems. However, the problems are worded so as to not give away obvious numerical information and thus, allow the contestants to figure out the numerical parts of the questions to come up with the answers.

<text>Frank Heyling Furness (November 12, 1839 – June 27, 1912) was an American architect of the Victorian era. He designed more than 600 buildings, most in the Philadelphia area, and is remembered for his diverse, muscular, often inordinately scaled buildings, and for his influence on the Chicago-based architect Louis Sullivan. Furness also received a Medal of Honor for bravery during the Civil War.

Toward the end of his life, his bold style fell out of fashion, and many of his significant works were demolished in the 20th century. Among his most important surviving buildings are the University of Pennsylvania Library, now the Fisher Fine Arts Library, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia, all in Philadelphia, and the Baldwin School Residence Hall in Bryn Mawr.

==Early life and education==
Furness was born in Philadelphia on November 12, 1839. His father, William Henry Furness, was a prominent Unitarian minister and abolitionist, and his brother, Horace Howard Furness, became America&#x27;s outstanding Shakespeare scholar. Frank, however, did not attend a university and apparently did not travel to Europe. He began his architectural training in the office of John Fraser, Philadelphia, in the 1850s. He attended the -inspired atelier of Richard Morris Hunt in New York City, from 1859 to 1861, and again in 1865, following his military service. Furness considered himself Hunt&#x27;s apprentice and was influenced by Hunt&#x27;s dynamic personality and accomplished, elegant buildings. He was also influenced by the architectural concepts of the French engineer Viollet-le-Duc and the British critic John Ruskin.

==Career==


Furness&#x27;s first commission, Germantown Unitarian Church (1866–67, demolished ca. 1928), was a solo effort, but in 1867, he formed a partnership with Fraser, his former teacher, and George Hewitt, who had worked in the office of John Notman. The trio lasted less than five years, and its major commissions were Rodef Shalom Synagogue (1868–69, demolished) and the Lutheran Church of the Holy Communion (1870–75, demolished). In 1897, Furness designed an addition to the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society (PSFS) 1869 building which has now been incorporated into the St. James, a high-rise luxury apartment complex in the city’s Washington Square neighborhood.

Following Fraser&#x27;s move to Washington, D.C., to become supervising architect for the U.S. Treasury Department, the two younger men formed a partnership in 1871, and soon won the design competition for the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1871–76). Louis Sullivan worked briefly as a draftsman for Furness &amp; Hewitt (June – November 1873), and his later use of organic decorative motifs can be traced, at least in part, to Furness. By the beginning of 1876, Furness had broken with Hewitt, and the firm carried only his name. Hewitt and his brother William formed their own firm, G.W. &amp; W.D. Hewitt, and became Furness&#x27;s biggest competitor. In 1881, Furness promoted his chief draftsman, Allen Evans, to partner (Furness &amp; Evans); and, in 1886, did the same for four other long-time employees. The firm continued under the name Furness, Evans &amp; Company as late as 1932, two decades after its founder&#x27;s death.

Furness was one of the most highly paid architects of his era, and a founder of the Philadelphia Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Over his 45-year career, he designed more than 600 buildings, including banks, office buildings, churches, and synagogues. Nearly one-third of his commissions came from railroad companies. As chief architect of the Reading Railroad, he designed about 130 stations and industrial buildings. For the Pennsylvania Railroad, he designed more than 20 structures, including the great Broad Street Station (demolished 1953) at Broad and Market Streets in Philadelphia. His 40 stations for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad included the ingenious 24th Street Station (demolished 1963) beside the Chestnut Street Bridge. His residential buildings included numerous mansions in Philadelphia and its suburbs, especially the Philadelphia Main Line and commissioned houses at the New Jersey Shore, and in Newport, Rhode Island, Bar Harbor, Maine, Washington, D.C.; New York state, and Chicago.

Furness broke from dogmatic adherence to European trends, and juxtaposed styles and elements in a forceful manner. His strong architectural will is seen in the unorthodox way he combined materials: stone, iron, glass, terra cotta, and brick. And his straightforward use of these materials, often in innovative or technologically advanced ways, reflected Philadelphia&#x27;s industrial-realist culture of the post–Civil War period.

===Interior design and furniture===
Furness designed custom furniture for a number of his early residences and buildings. One notable commission was the 1870–1871 redesign of the interiors of elder brother Horace Howard Furness&#x27;s city house, at the southwest corner of 7th and Locust Streets in Philadelphia. Work on Horace&#x27;s library included elaborate Neo-Grec bookcases, a reliquary for a (supposed) death mask of William Shakespeare, and a Neo-Grec desk, now at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. These pieces can be documented by drawings in Furness&#x27;s sketchbooks and a letter in HHF&#x27;s papers: &quot;These bookcases were placed in position this day—February 18th 1871. They were designed by Capt. Frank Furness, and made by Daniel Pabst …&quot;

In 1873, Furness designed interiors and furniture for the Manhattan city house of Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., father of the future president. Although the house was demolished, Furness/Pabst furniture from it survives at Sagamore Hill, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the High Museum of Art, in Atlanta.

Furness designed bookcases and a suite of table and armchairs for the boardroom of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, along with the lectern for its auditorium. Manufacture of these is attributed to Pabst. A, A Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts boardroom armchair is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, in London.

===Military service===
During the American Civil War, Furness served as captain and commander of Company F, 6th Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry, also known as &quot;Rush&#x27;s Lancers&quot;. He received the Medal of Honor for his gallantry at the Battle of Trevilian Station.

===Medal of Honor citation===
Rank and organization: Captain, Company F, 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry. Place and date: At Trevilian Station, Virginia, June 12, 1864. Entered service at: Philadelphia, Pa. Birth:------. Date of issue: October 20, 1899.
Citation:
The President of the United States of America, in the name of Congress, takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to Captain (Cavalry) Frank Furness, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism on 12 June 1864, while serving with Company F, 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry, in action at Trevilian Station, Virginia. Captain Furness voluntarily carried a box of ammunition across an open space swept by the enemy&#x27;s fire to the relief of an outpost whose ammunition had become almost exhausted, but which was thus enabled to hold its important position.

===Gettysburg monument===

Twenty-five years after fighting in the Battle of Gettysburg, he designed the monument to his regiment on South Cavalry Field:

In design it is a simple granite block, as massive as a dolmen, but surrounded by a corona of bronze lances that are models of the original lances. ... &quot;[T]&quot;hey are depicted in a resting position, as if waiting to be seized at any instant and brought into battle. The sense of suspended action before the moment of the battle is all the more potent because it is rendered in stone and metal, making it perpetual. Of the hundreds of monuments at Gettysburg, Furness&#x27;s is among the most haunting.

==Personal life==
Furness married Fanny Fassit in 1866, and they had four children: Radclyffe, Theodore, James, and Annis Lee. His brother-in-law, James Wilson Fassitt Jr. (1850–1892), became an architect in Furness&#x27;s firm, and was promoted to partner in 1886.

==Death==

Furness died on June 27, 1912, in Idlewild, Pennsylvania, at his summer house outside Media, Pennsylvania, and was buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. He was 72.

==Rediscovery==

Following decades of neglect, during which many of Furness&#x27;s most important buildings were demolished, there was a revival of interest in his work in the mid-20th century. The critic Lewis Mumford, tracing the creative forces that had influenced Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright, wrote in &quot;The Brown Decades&quot; (1931): &quot;Frank Furness was the designer of a bold, unabashed, ugly, and yet somehow healthily pregnant architecture.&quot;

The architectural historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock, in his comprehensive survey &quot;Architecture: Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries&quot; (revised 1963), saw beauty in that ugliness:

Architect and critic Robert Venturi in &quot;Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture&quot; (1966) wrote, not unadmiringly, of the National Bank of the Republic, later renamed the Philadelphia Clearing House:

The city street facade can provide a type of juxtaposed contradiction that is essentially two-dimensional. Frank Furness&#x27; Clearing House, now demolished like many of his best works in Philadelphia, contained an array of violent pressures within a rigid frame. The half-segmental arch, blocked by the submerged tower which, in turn, bisects the facade into a near duality, and the violent adjacencies of rectangles, squares, lunettes, and diagonals of contrasting sizes, compose a building seemingly held up by the buildings next door: it is an almost insane short story of a castle on a city street.

On the occasion of its centennial in 1969, the Philadelphia Chapter of the American Institute of Architects memorialized Furness as its &#x27;great architect of the past&#x27;:

For designing original and bold buildings free of the prevalent Victorian academicism and imitation, buildings of such vigor that the flood of classical traditionalism could not overwhelm them, or him, or his clients ...

For shaping iron and concrete with a sensitive understanding of their particular characteristics that was unique for his time ...

For his significance as innovator-architect along with his contemporaries John Root, Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright ...

For his masterworks, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Provident Trust Company, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station, and the University of Pennsylvania Library (now renamed the Furness Building) ...

For his outstanding abilities as draftsman, teacher and inventor ...

For being a founder of the Philadelphia Chapter and of the John Stewardson Memorial Scholarship in Architecture ...

And above all, for creating architecture of imagination, decisive self-reliance, courage, and often great beauty, an architecture which to our eyes and spirits still expresses the unusual personal character, spirit and courage for which he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for bravery on a Civil War battlefield.

==Legacy==

Furness designed custom interiors and furniture in collaboration with Philadelphia cabinetmaker Daniel Pabst. Examples are in the collections of the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the University of Pennsylvania; the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia; the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and elsewhere. Mark-Lee Kirk&#x27;s set designs for the 1942 Orson Welles film &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; seem to be based on Furness&#x27;s ornate Neo-Grec interiors of the 1870s. A fictional desk designed by Furness is featured in the John Bellairs novel &quot;The Mansion in the Mist&quot;.

Furness&#x27;s independence and modernist Victorian-Gothic style inspired 20th-century architects Louis Kahn and Robert Venturi. Living in Philadelphia and teaching at the University of Pennsylvania, they often visited Furness&#x27;s Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts — built for the 1876 Centennial — and his University of Pennsylvania Library.

In 1973, the Philadelphia Museum of Art mounted the first retrospective of Furness&#x27;s work, curated by James F. O&#x27;Gorman, George E. Thomas and Hyman Myers. Thomas, Jeffrey A. Cohen and Michael J. Lewis authored &quot;Frank Furness: The Complete Works&quot; (1991, revised 1996), with an introduction by Robert Venturi. Lewis wrote the first biography: &quot;Frank Furness: Architecture and the Violent Mind&quot; (2001).

The 2012 centenary of Furness&#x27;s death was observed with exhibitions at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, the Library Company of Philadelphia, the Athenaeum of Philadelphia, the Delaware Historical Society, the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia, and elsewhere. On September 14, a Pennsylvania state historical marker was dedicated in front of Furness&#x27;s boyhood home at 1426 Pine Street, Philadelphia (now Peirce College Alumni Hall). Opposite the marker is Furness&#x27;s 1874–75 dormitory addition to the Pennsylvania Institute for the Deaf and Dumb, now the Furness Residence Hall of the University of the Arts.

<text>In computer security, an attack vector is a specific path, method, or scenario that can be exploited to break into an IT system, thus compromising its security. The term was derived from the corresponding notion of vector in biology. An attack vector may be exploited manually, automatically, or through a combination of manual and automatic activity.

Often, this is a multi-step process. For instance, malicious code (code that the user did not consent to being run and that performs actions the user would not consent to) often operates by being added to a harmless seeming document made available to an end user. When the unsuspecting end user opens the document, the malicious code in question (known as the payload) is executed and performs the abusive tasks it was programmed to execute, which may include things such as spreading itself further, opening up unauthorized access to the IT system, stealing or encrypting the user&#x27;s documents, etc.

In order to limit the chance of discovery once installed, the code in question is often obfuscated by layers of seemingly harmless code.

Some common attack vectors:
* exploiting buffer overflows; this is how the Blaster worm was able to propagate.
* exploiting webpages and email supporting the loading and subsequent execution of JavaScript or other types of scripts without properly limiting their powers.
* exploiting networking protocol flaws to perform unauthorized actions at the other end of a network connection.
* phishing: sending deceptive messages to end users to entice them to reveal confidential information, such as passwords.

<doc id="297021" wikidata="Q864333" url="?curid=297021" title="Transcendental function">
<text>In mathematics, a transcendental function is an analytic function that does not satisfy a polynomial equation whose coefficients are functions of the independent variable that can be written using only the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (without the need of taking limits). This is in contrast to an algebraic function. 

Examples of transcendental functions include the exponential function, the logarithm function, the hyperbolic functions, and the trigonometric functions. Equations over these expressions are called transcendental equations.

==Definition==
Formally, an analytic function formula_1 of one real or complex variable is transcendental if it is algebraically independent of that variable. This means the function does not satisfy any polynomial equation. For example, the function formula_1 given by

:formula_3 for all formula_4

is not transcendental, but algebraic, because it satisfies the polynomial equation

:formula_5.

Similarly, the function formula_1 that satisfies the equation

:formula_7 for all formula_4

is not transcendental, but algebraic, even though it cannot be written as a finite expression involving the basic arithmetic operations.

This definition can be extended to functions of several variables.

==History==
The transcendental functions sine and cosine were tabulated from physical measurements in antiquity, as evidenced in Greece (Hipparchus) and India (jya and koti-jya). In describing Ptolemy&#x27;s table of chords, an equivalent to a table of sines, Olaf Pedersen wrote:

A revolutionary understanding of these circular functions occurred in the 17th century and was explicated by Leonhard Euler in 1748 in his Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite. These ancient transcendental functions became known as continuous functions through quadrature of the rectangular hyperbola by Grégoire de Saint-Vincent in 1647, two millennia after Archimedes had produced &quot;The Quadrature of the Parabola&quot;. 

The area under the hyperbola was shown to have the scaling property of constant area for a constant ratio of bounds. The hyperbolic logarithm function so described was of limited service until 1748 when Leonhard Euler related it to functions where a constant is raised to a variable exponent, such as the exponential function where the constant base is e. By introducing these transcendental functions and noting the bijection property that implies an inverse function, some facility was provided for algebraic manipulations of the natural logarithm even if it is not an algebraic function.

The exponential function is written Euler identified it with the infinite series where denotes the factorial of .

The even and odd terms of this series provide sums denoting and , so that formula_9 These transcendental hyperbolic functions can be converted into circular functions sine and cosine by introducing into the series, resulting in alternating series. After Euler, mathematicians view the sine and cosine this way to relate the transcendence to logarithm and exponent functions, often through Euler&#x27;s formula in complex number arithmetic.

==Examples==

The following functions are transcendental:

formula_10

For the first function formula_11, the exponent &quot;formula_12&quot; can be replaced by any other irrational number, and the function will remain transcendental. For the second and third functions formula_13 and formula_14, the base &quot;formula_15&quot; can be replaced by any other positive real number base not equaling 1, and the functions will remain transcendental. Functions 4-8 denote the hyperbolic trigonometric functions, while functions 9-13 denote the circular trigonometric functions. The fourteenth function formula_16 denotes the analytic extension of the factorial function via the gamma function, and formula_17 is its reciprocal, an entire function. Finally, in the last function formula_18, the exponent formula_4 can be replaced by formula_20 for any nonzero real formula_21, and the function will remain transcendental.

==Algebraic and transcendental functions==
The most familiar transcendental functions are the logarithm, the exponential (with any non-trivial base), the trigonometric, and the hyperbolic functions, and the inverses of all of these. Less familiar are the special functions of analysis, such as the gamma, elliptic, and zeta functions, all of which are transcendental. The generalized hypergeometric and Bessel functions are transcendental in general, but algebraic for some special parameter values.

Transcendental functions cannot be defined using only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and formula_22th roots (where formula_22 is any integer), without using some &quot;limiting process&quot;.

A function that is not transcendental is algebraic. Simple examples of algebraic functions are the rational functions and the square root function, but in general, algebraic functions cannot be defined as finite formulas of the elementary functions, as shown by the example above with formula_7 (see Abel–Ruffini theorem).

The indefinite integral of many algebraic functions is transcendental. For example, the integral formula_25 turns out to equal the logarithm function formula_26. Similarly, the limit or the infinite sum of many algebraic function sequences is transcendental. For example, formula_27 converges to the exponential function formula_28, and the infinite sum formula_29 turns out to equal the hyperbolic cosine function formula_30. In fact, it is &quot;impossible&quot; to define any transcendental function in terms of algebraic functions without using some such &quot;limiting procedure&quot; (integrals, sequential limits, and infinite sums are just a few).

Differential algebra examines how integration frequently creates functions that are algebraically independent of some class, such as when one takes polynomials with trigonometric functions as variables.

==Transcendentally transcendental functions==

Most familiar transcendental functions, including the special functions of mathematical physics, are solutions of algebraic differential equations. Those that are not, such as the gamma and the zeta functions, are called &quot;transcendentally transcendental&quot; or &quot;hypertranscendental&quot; functions.

==Exceptional set==
If is an algebraic function and formula_31 is an algebraic number then is also an algebraic number. The converse is not true: there are entire transcendental functions such that is an algebraic number for any algebraic . For a given transcendental function the set of algebraic numbers giving algebraic results is called the exceptional set of that function. Formally it is defined by:

formula_32

In many instances the exceptional set is fairly small. For example, formula_33 this was proved by Lindemann in 1882. In particular is transcendental. Also, since is algebraic we know that cannot be algebraic. Since is algebraic this implies that is a transcendental number.

In general, finding the exceptional set of a function is a difficult problem, but if it can be calculated then it can often lead to results in transcendental number theory. Here are some other known exceptional sets:

* Klein&#x27;s &quot;j&quot;-invariant formula_34 where is the upper half-plane, and is the degree of the number field This result is due to Theodor Schneider.
* Exponential function in base 2: formula_35This result is a corollary of the Gelfond–Schneider theorem, which states that if formula_36 is algebraic, and formula_37 is algebraic and irrational then formula_38 is transcendental. Thus the function could be replaced by for any algebraic not equal to 0 or 1. Indeed, we have: formula_39
* A consequence of Schanuel&#x27;s conjecture in transcendental number theory would be that formula_40
* A function with empty exceptional set that does not require assuming Schanuel&#x27;s conjecture is formula_41

While calculating the exceptional set for a given function is not easy, it is known that given &quot;any&quot; subset of the algebraic numbers, say , there is a transcendental function whose exceptional set is . The subset does not need to be proper, meaning that can be the set of algebraic numbers. This directly implies that there exist transcendental functions that produce transcendental numbers only when given transcendental numbers. Alex Wilkie also proved that there exist transcendental functions for which first-order-logic proofs about their transcendence do not exist by providing an exemplary analytic function.

==Dimensional analysis==
In dimensional analysis, transcendental functions are notable because they make sense only when their argument is dimensionless (possibly after algebraic reduction). Because of this, transcendental functions can be an easy-to-spot source of dimensional errors. For example, is a nonsensical expression, unlike or . One could attempt to apply a logarithmic identity to get , which highlights the problem: applying a non-algebraic operation to a dimension creates meaningless results.

<text>Salvatore Giuliano (; Sicilian: Turiddu or Sarvaturi Giulianu; 16 November 1922 – 5 July 1950) was an Italian brigand, who rose to prominence in the disorder that followed the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943. In September of that year, Giuliano became an outlaw after shooting and killing a police officer who tried to arrest him for black market food smuggling, at a time when 70 percent of Sicily&#x27;s food supply was provided by the black market. He maintained a band of subordinates for most of his career. He was a flamboyant, high-profile criminal, attacking the police at least as often as they sought him. In addition, he was a local power-broker in Sicilian politics between 1945 and 1948, including his role as a nominal colonel for the Movement for the Independence of Sicily. He and his band were held legally responsible for the Portella della Ginestra massacre, though there is some doubt about their role in the numerous deaths which occurred.

The widespread international press coverage he attracted made him an embarrassment to the Italian government, and throughout his banditry, up to 2,000 police and soldiers were deployed against him. He was murdered on 5 July 1950. The historian Eric Hobsbawm described him as the last of the &quot;people&#x27;s bandits&quot; (à la Robin Hood) and the first to be covered in real time by modern mass media.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Giuliano was born on 16 November 1922, in Montelepre, a rural village in western Sicily, the fourth and youngest child of Salvatore Giuliano, Sr. and Maria Lombardo. His parents were landed peasants who had spent some of their earlier lives in the United States where they had earned the money to buy their farmland.

Turi or Turridu—as he was known to distinguish him from his father—attended primary school in the village from the age of 10 to 13. Although he was a good student, when his older brother Giuseppe was drafted into the Italian armed forces in 1935, he left school to help his father cultivate the family farm. He soon tired of the drudgery of farm work, hired a substitute from the village to take his place, and began trading in olive oil, which brought additional income to the family. Later in life he claimed that he quit school as much from youthful impulsiveness as from economic necessity.

The outbreak of World War II brought him opportunities in the form of jobs installing road barriers and telephone infrastructure. He performed well, but was dismissed from both jobs after disputes with his bosses. At the time of the Allied Invasion of Sicily in July 1943, Giuliano was once again trading in olive oil.

===Outlaw career===
The most immediate trouble caused by the Allied invasion was the breakdown of government structures and the legal distribution of food. Especially in the cities, up to 70% of the food was supplied through the black market, including small-scale operators to large scale, well-financed and well-organized operations. With a horse brought home from the war by his brother and a Beretta handgun for protection, Giuliano was soon a participant in the black market.

The Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories (AMGOT) used the remnants of the previous fascist government, especially the Polizia and Carabinieri, to suppress the black market. Since their pay was irregular and most of their income was bribes from major black marketeers, they focused their attention on minor operators. On 2 September 1943, Giuliano was caught at a Carabinieri check point transporting two sacks of black market grain. While trying to negotiate his release in return for surrendering the grain, Giuliano drew his gun when another black marketeer was apprehended. When one of the officers raised his weapon, Giuliano shot and killed him. He was shot in the back as he fled. After the escape and an operation arranged by his family, he hid out in the family home. 

On Christmas Eve 1943, the Carabinieri moved into Montelepre to apprehend Giuliano. The operation included mass arrests—a dragnet. He escaped, but angered by the dragnet, he shot and killed another officer. Benefitting from his intimate knowledge of the surrounding mountainous terrain Giulano was able to evade the authorities, while visiting his family occasionally. On 30 January 1944, he helped the escape of eight fellow villagers from the jail in Monreale. Six of them joined him and formed a band that was able to expand operations.

With no income and outside of the law, Giuliano turned to banditry, and later extortion and kidnapping. His exclusive target was the wealthy, partly from identification with poor peasants, but mostly for efficiency—the rich had more money. Thanks to Sicily&#x27;s omerta tradition, local peasants were reluctant to cooperate with law enforcement, and Giuliano made them his allies and effective co-conspirators. Throughout his career he paid up to ten times the going market rate for his supplies to the locals. They became good sources of intelligence about rich targets for his crimes, as well as law enforcement activity. While Giuliano&#x27;s core band was never larger than 20 men, peasants from Montelepre and nearby Giardinello would join him in the mountains temporarily for the excellent pay the bandit offered. This pattern continued until the last few beleaguered months of his career.

The bandit also won allegiance by enforcing rough justice in the area he came to dominate. On at least one occasion, he killed a rogue bandit committing crimes in his name. He shot Montelepre&#x27;s postmaster for stealing parcels from America. Storekeeper Giuseppe Terranova was executed for extortionate prices and usury. He intervened with a local gabelotto, an estate manager, to lease land to farmers from Montelepre.

If benevolence failed, Giuliano killed informers and enemies ruthlessly. Whenever possible they were allowed a minute to pray before death and a note of responsibility was left; to warn other spies, and to make sure that neither Giuliano nor other bandits would be accused of crimes they didn&#x27;t commit. From time to time, he and his men would attack Carabinieri and Polizia outposts and patrols, often killing lawmen. They killed 87 Carabinieri and 33 Polizia from 1943–49. 

Giuliano was admired for his bravery and resistance—but even more because he routinely prevailed in contests of power—the ultimate measure of worth in Sicilian culture, with its premium on individualism and settling one&#x27;s own scores. The peasantry identified strongly with him and protected him.

The bandit&#x27;s most famous exploit occurred early in his career in 1944—the robbery of the Duchess of Pratameno. He and his men sneaked into her estate unnoticed, and Giuliano was in her salon before she knew what was occurring. He kissed her hand and showed respect for her noble status, but then demanded all of her jewelry. When she refused, Giuliano threatened to kidnap her children. After she handed the loot over, he took a diamond ring from her hand, which he wore for the rest of his life, and borrowed John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; from her library before leaving (which was returned with a respectful note a week later). By mid-1945, Giuliano&#x27;s daring, good looks, and theatrical flair were the talk of Sicily, and soon beyond.

===MIS, EVIS, kidnapping and extortion===

In April 1945 venturing onto the larger stage of politics, Giuliano issued a public declaration of his support for MIS, the Movement for the Independence of Sicily (also referred to as Separatism). Separatism coalesced in the aftermath of the invasion, drawing on long-simmering anger at Sicily&#x27;s neglect by the central government, and the sudden fluidity of the political situation. The movement was dealt a severe blow when, for political and war strategy reasons, the Allies, who had courted, if not encouraged separatist leaders, handed control of Sicily to the Badoglio government in Rome in February 1944. Strong sentiment for independence still existed in Sicily, but the three main Italian political parties of post-war Italy, Christian Democratic, Communist, and Socialist—were all opposed to Sicilian independence. After a government enabled campaign of violent repression, the MIS decided to augment its political campaign with armed resistance. Their small armed contingent, the EVIS, operated in Catania Province in eastern Sicily. To strengthen their forces and divert attention from their army, the leaders of MIS and EVIS enlisted Giuliano, who after negotiating for substantial funding, accepted the rank of Colonel, and agreed to conduct an armed campaign in his zone. He recruited 40–60 young men (in addition to his regular band), provided them with uniforms, ranks, and weapons, and trained them. Among the recruits was Gaspare Pisciotta, nicknamed Aspanu. He and Turi would be virtually inseparable friends for the rest of Giuliano&#x27;s life, and by the end of the MIS military campaign Pisciotta would become his second-in-command, also for the rest of the chieftain&#x27;s life. Contrary to many reports, the Montelepre native was neither a cousin, nor a close childhood friend of Giuliano.

On 27 December 1945, Giuliano launched his insurrection with an attack on a Carabinieri outpost—two days before the MIS army was put out of existence at San Mauro. Their campaign, the most publicly spectacular of the bandit&#x27;s career, created havoc for the police forces and government. Martial law was declared in Montelepre and the surrounding region on 13 January 1946, and continued for 126 days—at times incorporating army units. Giuliano&#x27;s campaign was so effective that up to 500 police officers and soldiers were deployed against him. During the MIS campaign, the national Minister of the Interior Giuseppe Romita offered 800,000 lire for the capture of Giuliano—who responded with a 2 million lire reward for the capture of Romita. The chieftain and his men eventually realized the political hopelessness of their situation, and the revolt dissolved, as the new recruits went back to their ordinary lives. Giuliano helped at least 2 of his men to emigrate to the U.S. The EVIS campaign drew widespread news coverage, and made the bandit an international figure.

After the revolt the MIS resumed its political campaign, which was plagued by poor organization. Through surrogates, Giuliano campaigned for the MIS in the towns where he was the major power. On 2 June 1946 Giardinello, Monreale, and Montelepre voted heavily for the Separatists, but island wide, they received only 9% of the vote.

For the rest of 1946 and until his death, Giuliano&#x27;s main activity and source of revenue was kidnapping, often carried out by the squad of Antonio Terranova, the bandit&#x27;s most formidable and resourceful operative. Giuliano and his men treated their captives well—almost chivalrously—often giving them favorite foods, reading to them to alleviate boredom, and providing necessary medicines. Negotiations were usually conducted through various mafiosi. More than one kidnap victim remembered time with Giuliano in a positive light, despite its hardships. Giuliano also used the threat of kidnapping to extort money from wealthy Sicilians—some preferred kidnapping because the bandit stuck to his own rule that no one would be kidnapped twice, while the number of extortions had no limit.

===Portella della Ginestra===

Giuliano&#x27;s next foray into politics ended in disaster. In the 1947 Sicilian regional election, the MIS won 9% of the vote but began a steady deterioration from which it never recovered. The winner of the election with 30% of the vote was the Popular Bloc, Communists-Socialists, against less than 20% for the Christian Democrats. The island&#x27;s conservatives and reactionaries were alarmed and called on Giuliano for help. Their main aim was to intimidate the peasantry and thwart calls for land reform and redistribution. Although Giuliano identified with the peasantry and had progressive ideas for land reform close to left-wing doctrine, he was staunchly anti-Communist, based on stories of the U.S. he heard from his parents. This, and his practical desire for a pardon from Sicily&#x27;s power brokers, inclined him to cooperate with the existing, predominantly right-wing power structure against the left. Giuliano may have been influenced by his interview early in 1947 with US pulp journalist Michael Stern. The American wore his WWII journalist sergeant&#x27;s uniform to lend himself official credibility during his interview. Giuliano spoke to Stern as though the writer represented the US government, presenting a letter addressed to President Truman. The bandit emphasized his antipathy for Communism to Stern, who did nothing to discourage the bandit&#x27;s mistaken notion that he was an official representative of the U.S. government. The interview led to a 5-page article in Life Magazine, (23 Feb 1948, pp. 60–64). Stern&#x27;s subterfuge may have unwittingly influenced the bandit to cooperate with the Sicilian right.

The target of the right-wing vested interests was a famous annual May Day celebration at the Portella della Ginestra. A few days before the festivities, Giuliano received a letter that was evidently the culmination of negotiations. After reading it, the bandit chieftain burned it and announced, &quot;The hour of our liberation has come. We are going to attack the Communists, to go to fire on them on 1 May at Portella della Ginestra&quot;. One of his bandits protested that women and children would be present. The chieftain replied that only leaders would be targeted. Giuliano&#x27;s behaviour before and after the armed action indicates that he believed that he and his men would be offered pardons for their crimes if all went well on May Day, an outcome ostensibly guaranteed by some prominent Sicilian. According to Giuliano&#x27;s later statements, &quot;his&quot; main aim of the day was the capture of Girolamo Li Causi, head of the Communist party of Sicily—any other action was a diversionary tactic to facilitate Li Causi&#x27;s capture. Although scheduled to speak, Li Causi did not attend.

Between 3000 and 5000 peasants attended. As the official proceedings began, three volleys of gunfire erupted from an ambush on adjoining Mount Pizzuta. Bullets from the third volley went into the crowds. The result was mass terror and many casualties—11 dead (including a woman and 3 children) and between 2 and 3 dozen wounded. Giuliano, the perpetrator of massed gunfire along with his band, left the scene quickly and surreptitiously, reportedly unaware of the massacre. When he learned what had transpired, he was distraught over the deaths and angry that his plans had gone awry.

The reaction throughout Italy was a profound shock, followed by demands to punish the perpetrators. Initial suspicion fell on the Mafia and Sicily&#x27;s large landowners. Characteristically, major Mafiosi in the area had alibis so good that Sicilians and others knowledgeable in their ways assumed that they had been arranged in advance. Some of their local chieftains had also given warnings to likely May Day celebrants before the event. There were reports of four armed local Mafiosi leaving the Portella area shortly after the massacre, but when Giuliano&#x27;s involvement became known, investigation of the Mafia halted, and the bandits became the inquiry&#x27;s focus. Giuliano and his men were isolated and a convenient target for officialdom, while the Mafia was well-connected politically and difficult to deal with.

Pisciotta and eleven other members of the Giuliano band were convicted for the massacre in 1952. While alive, Giuliano himself made various, somewhat inconsistent statements about the matter, always insisting that the bloodshed was unintended. He threatened to reveal the names of the men behind his actions but never did. During the trial for the massacre, Pisciotta named the main conspirators as Leone Marchesano, a Palermo Mafioso and politician, and Prince Giuseppe Alliata of Monreale, with politician Cusumano Geloso as their intermediary—Pisciotta met only Geloso. His claims were confirmed by a letter delivered in 1969 to Giuseppe Montalbano, a long-time leftist opponent of the reactionary establishment of Sicily. The writer, Antonio Ramirez—a prominent Palermo politician—ordered the letter delivered after his death. It stated that Gioacchino Barbera, a ranking Mafioso, had confirmed Pisciotta&#x27;s accusations concerning Sicilian power brokers, and also confirmed Giuliano&#x27;s claim that the main conspirators did not intend the massacre. Barbera revealed all this to Ramirez during a December 1951 conversation. Billy Jaynes Chandler concludes that Sicily&#x27;s reactionary establishment was the casus belli of the massacre, but that thanks to omerta and time, the details will never be revealed. A plaque erected by leftists in memory of the victims at Portella della Ginestra blames &quot;landed barons and the Mafia.&quot;*

:&quot;On 1 May 1947, here, on the rock of Barbato, celebrating the working class festival and the victory of 20 April, the people of Piana degli Albanesi, San Giuseppe Jato, and San Ciprirello, men, women and children, fell under the ferocious barbarity of the bullets of the Mafia and the landed barons, who mowed down innocent victims in order to put an end to the struggle of the peasants for liberation from the servitude of feudalism. The slaughter horrified the world. The blood of new martyrs consecrated in the conscience of the people the resolve to continue the struggle for the redemption of the land in a world of liberty and peace.&quot;

For the remainder of 1947, Giuliano maintained a low public profile while continuing his kidnap and ransom enterprise, occasionally engaging in ambushes and firefights with the law forces as opportunities presented themselves or to assert dominance in his area of operations. The killing of a Carabiniere colonel in October 1947 occasioned a brief incursion of 1000 law enforcers and mass arrests but failed to capture Giuliano or any member of his band. In January 1948, Giuliano and Pisciotta felt secure enough to make an early evening appearance in a popular cafe&#x27; in the town of Carini. The event was covered well by the Sicilian press, which speculated that it followed a tryst in the same town.

===Final political campaign===

After the Portella della Ginestra massacre, Giuliano&#x27;s family was interrogated regularly and often incarcerated. (His house was under such surveillance that he could no longer visit.) Moved by their plight and desperate for some sort of pardon, the bandit once again answered the call of conservative politicians to work on their behalf in the 1948 elections.

In 1948 the parties of the Italian right and centre were determined to undo the left&#x27;s 1947 victory, and they were seeking every possible vote. The politicians couldn&#x27;t afford to ignore the votes Giuliano controlled. Leone Marchesano, Santo Fleres, head of the Mafia and the Liberal Party in Partinico, and prominent Christian Democrat Bernardo Mattarella from the Mafia stronghold of Castellamare del Golfo all talked directly with Giuliano—who would not campaign without promises from the highest level of Sicilian power brokers. He was guaranteed a full pardon if he delivered a large majority of the votes in his district. He delivered extravagant majorities for the centre-right&#x27;s victory on 18 April. The bandit waited for weeks after the election for word of his pardon—and he was finally informed that Minister of the Interior Mario Scelba, himself a Sicilian, had denied it, and advised that Giuliano and his men could emigrate to Brazil where Prince Alliata had vast estates and the bandits would be protected.

Giuliano, who had held up his end of a bargain, was outraged and promised retaliation. Shortly after seeing his mother and Mariannina for what would be the last time at a June picnic in the countryside, the bandit learned that, besides the broken promise of a pardon, Santo Fleres&#x27; Mafia faction was informing law enforcement of Giuliano&#x27;s movements. On 17 July 1948 two local Partinico bandits, hired by Giuliano, assassinated Fleres in that town&#x27;s square. Thereafter, most of the Mafia organizations worked against Giuliano, effectively sealing his eventual fate. In the first action by any Mafiosi after Fleres&#x27; death, Giuliano opted out late from a law enforcement-Mafia fake escape to Tunisia by speedboat, probably forewarned by a still friendly Mafia faction or politician. Law enforcement also stepped up its own campaign against the bandit—from the middle of 1948 until Giuliano&#x27;s death Montelepre was occupied in some state of siege by law enforcement, making the inhabitants&#x27; lives miserable. By the end of the year, all of his family was imprisoned.

Toward the end of 1948, a bit of relief arrived in the person of Maria Cyliakus, a Swedish dilettante journalist estranged from her Greek industrialist husband. Through audacity and luck she managed to visit, interview, and photograph Giuliano in the mountains, enhancing his notoriety throughout Europe, and giving Cyliakus her own burst of celebrity status.

===Bellolampo and final actions===

Although Giuliano was under considerable duress by the beginning of 1949, he still had strengths to draw from. While his core band was diminished, men from the vicinity would still join him for the high wages he offered until the last months of 1949. His kidnapping and extortion rackets still produced sufficient income. For the first eight months of the year, he dominated the forces of law in his bailiwick—staging numerous ambushes and occasionally attacking their headquarters.

The publicity from Giuliano&#x27;s continued mastery over the forces of law and order caused great consternation to Italy&#x27;s Christian Democratic government, and in August Minister of the Interior Scelba dispatched Colonel Ugo Luca, commander of Carabinieri in Lazio, to &quot;observe&quot; enforcement activity in Sicily, then overseen by Ciro Verdiani. Aged 58 and known as the &quot;Italian Lawrence&quot; Luca had a stellar military record, especially distinguished in intelligence work, and had been recommended to Scelba as a possible replacement for Verdiani. When Giuliano learned that Verdiani and Luca planned to visit the Bellolampo Carabinieri outpost between Palermo and Montelepre on 19 August, he prepared an ambush. After the two officials made a quick inspection, Giuliano and his men detonated a large explosion on the road under their convoy on its return to Palermo. Eight men were killed and over ten wounded. Had Luca and Verdiani returned in the vehicle they had ridden to Bellolampo, they would have been seriously wounded or killed. As a direct result, Verdiani was sent to Italy&#x27;s Alpine region and Luca was dispatched to Sicily, along with 500 additional Carabinieri, to head up the campaign against Giuliano.

===Colonel Ugo Luca===

Luca would be Giuliano&#x27;s last state opponent. His second-in-command was Captain Antonio Perenze, who had fought against guerillas in Libya and Ethiopia. After initial demonstrations of bravado in the field by the two leaders, Luca implemented his &#x27;isolate and neutralize&#x27; strategy. He began by dividing the bandits&#x27; operational area into seventy zones, each to be patrolled by 20 men, who were given superior radio communications equipment demanded by Luca. Most of the men assumed civilian dress. They remained in the field, not retreating to safe stations and barracks each night. They were also ordered to cultivate good relations with the populace, eschewing pointless intimidation. Luca also sought to infiltrate the band or turn some of its members. Other officials had used similar tactics, but none were as thorough and relentless as the colonel.

Shortly after Luca&#x27;s arrival, a meeting of major Mafiosi decreed that its members were to work with the colonel to eliminate the bandits. The Mafia men did not want a law officer of Luca&#x27;s caliber on the island any longer than necessary. Mafiosi all over western Sicily received and forwarded information to the task force.

Giuliano was isolated and his operations essentially crippled by October. None of his attacks on the Carabinieri or Polizia during Luca&#x27;s command were successful. Only one of the 120 law officers killed by Giuliano and his band met his end during Luca&#x27;s command. Individual arrests of bandits began in late September and on 13 October, most of Giuliano&#x27;s key squad and its leader, Giuseppe Cucinella, were captured in a gun battle in Palermo. Cucinella and his men had been located and Luca informed by Mafiosi from Palermo. Smaller scale arrests, following the same pattern took place throughout the colonel&#x27;s campaign.

Under duress in the territory he formerly dominated, Giuliano (and sometimes Pisciotta) surrendered most of his independence, and retreated to the protection of a Mafia branch in Castelvetrano, near the south coast, headed by Nicola &#x27;The American&#x27; Piccione, repatriated from a successful career in the United States. The bandit&#x27;s primary residence while in the Castelvetrano region was the home, in the heart of the city, of Gregorio de Maria, a childhood friend of Piccione&#x27;s subordinate Giuseppe &#x27;Pino&#x27; Marotta. De Maria, an erudite and reclusive attorney, formed a bond with Giuliano as the bandit&#x27;s intellectual mentor.

Although Ciro Verdiani had been replaced and dispatched, he maintained his contacts and continued to meddle in Sicily. To spite Luca and their mutual superiors, in December 1949 he arranged for Jacopo Rizza of Oggi magazine to interview Giuliano and Pisciotta in the countryside near Salemi. The interview, published in successive issues of the weekly, caused a sensation and embarrassed the government. Verdiani did much more, meeting with Giuliano near Castelvetrano, also in December. He agreed to help Giuliano and Pisciotta into exile, although his ultimate aim was almost certainly to kill the bandits and claim credit for the deed. The two men remained in contact until the last day of Giuliano&#x27;s life, but in the end Verdiani&#x27;s machinations failed.

===End of the career===

In January 1950 a Sicilian carabiniere, Giovanni Lo Bianco, coerced Giuliano&#x27;s treasurer, Benedetto Minasola, into betraying the bandit. Minasola set up band members to be captured by the authorities one at a time until April, when Giuliano had no more active operatives. Minasola was then able to persuade Aspanu Pisciotta to betray his closest friend—Pisciotta was an easy target, having long doubted Verdiani&#x27;s plot to get himself and Giuliano out of the country.

On 19 June, Pisciotta met with Colonel Luca and agreed to work with him to eliminate Giuliano. After deliberation and intrigue among Luca&#x27;s command, it was decided to kill Giuliano on the morning of 5 July in Castelvetrano. Pisciotta would lure Giuliano out to the street, and a squad of Carabinieri led by Captain Perenze would assassinate the bandit chieftain. Unfortunately for Luca, one of Verdiani&#x27;s partisans was at the planning meeting, and Verdiani sent Giuliano a letter warning of Pisciotta&#x27;s betrayal. When Aspanu arrived at the de Maria house after midnight on 5 July, Turi confronted him with Verdiani&#x27;s communique—somehow, Pisciotta convinced him that he was more trustworthy than the policeman but didn&#x27;t dare to suggest they leave the house for the ambush. After both men laid down, ostensibly to sleep, Pisciotta waited until Giuliano was asleep. He then shot him twice killing him instantly. Aspanu ran outside, told a waiting Perenze what he&#x27;d done, and was spirited out of town. Perenze and his squad hauled Giuliano&#x27;s corpse to a nearby courtyard, shot it with several rounds, and with Luca concocted a story of an informer, Giuliano&#x27;s plan to flee the country by plane from Mazzara del Vallo, and the bandit&#x27;s death in a running gun battle.

The next morning, Luca and Perenze repeated the story to the press in the courtyard, while visitors traipsed through to see Giuliano&#x27;s body. Many observers, especially locals who&#x27;d heard rumors that didn&#x27;t coincide with the official account, were skeptical of the official story. In the afternoon after the body had been moved to the local morgue, Maria Lombardo arrived. She fainted upon seeing the body, was revived, and identified her son. She insisted on kissing the bloodstains on the ground where he had lain in the courtyard.

Thanks to official wrangling, the body remained in Castelvetrano until 19 July (allowing hundreds of locals to view it in the interim). The burial in Montelepre that afternoon was private, on official orders to prevent publicity.

The official story was unraveled by Tommaso Besozzi of the Milanese weekly L&#x27;Europeo. In the 16 and 24 July issues, he named Pisciotta as the murderer, but substituted misleading initials for Minasola. In spite of later official testimony by Pisciotta, de Maria, and Perenze confirming Besozzi&#x27;s reportage, the concocted story remains as the official account.

Aspanu Pisciotta remained at large until 5 December when he emerged from a concealed space in his family&#x27;s home and was arrested. He had been hiding there since shortly after Giuliano&#x27;s murder, when the Carabinieri command, who couldn&#x27;t grant the amnesty he sought, turned him loose.

===Viterbo Trial===

A trial, which officially concerned the massacre at Portella della Ginestra convened at Viterbo, Lazio on 12 June 1950, but was quickly adjourned and reconvened in 1951. It then spun into a wide examination of Giuliano&#x27;s career. There were thirty six defendants, all with attorneys, many of whom wanted to expand the scope of the trial to embarrass the conservative government. All of the defendants except Pisciotta denied even being present at the May Day event. Pisciotta named many of the names previously cited, but also included Mario Scelba, Minister of the Interior. His revelations often occurred during barely coherent outburts—his behavior indicated a man in the grip of fear and uncertainty. On 11 May 1951, he admitted murdering Giuliano.

A great deal of testimony, some the most dramatic of the proceedings, concerned a reputed diary that Giuliano kept, naming the powerful politicians with whom he collaborated. Pisciotta, Perenze, Luca, Marotta, and especially de Maria figured in its saga. De Maria was accused by a Mafioso, Stefano de Peri of telling him that he had destroyed the memoirs. None of the accused admitted to knowing what became of Giuliano&#x27;s journal. Testimony concluded late in 1951, and in May 1952 twelve defendants, including Terranova and Pisciotta, were sentenced for life; four were given shorter sentences, and the remainder were acquitted. More trials followed: the last arrest of a Giuliano confederate on related charges was in 1964, and the last prisoner among them was released by 1980.

===Deaths of participants===

On 10 February 1954, a few days after he talked to Pietro Scaglione, an assistant prosecutor from Palermo, Aspanu Pisciotta was assassinated by poison in his cell at Ucciardone Prison in Palermo while breakfasting with his cellmate father. The dose was a substantial 20 centigrams of strychnine, enough to kill 40 dogs. When Ciro Verdiani and Cusumano Geloso died before their natural life expectancies, suspicions of poisoning were voiced. Benedetto Minasola was murdered in 1960. The Mafioso suspected of poisoning Pisciotta was shot in 1961, and Scaglione was killed by the Mafia while serving as Prosecutor General of Palermo in 1971.

==Historical context and interpretation==
Non-academic authors vary widely in their assessment of Giuliano.

Michael Stern&#x27;s first impression of the bandit was &quot;Errol Flynn portraying Pancho Villa&quot;. Gavin Maxwell pointed out that Giuliano was a romantic, hankering after justice from an early age—the bandit&#x27;s favorite author, Emilio Salgari, made a career from idealistic, romantic novels, and Giuliano was still reading them in his twenties living rough in the mountains. Gaia Servadio sees the bandit as a tool of the Mafia, whose notoriety and success were not the product of his personal qualities, but entirely a function of his mafioso protectors. She judges that he was easily eliminated once the protectors withdrew their support. For John Dickie, the &quot;truth&quot; of Giuliano resides not in his character, but in the tangle of power and politics that enmeshed his life—centered on the Mafia. Natalia Danesi Murray described Giuliano as a &quot;theatrical megalomaniac.&quot;

The academics Monte Finkelstein and Eric Hobsbawm both emphasize Giuliano&#x27;s historical role as an instrument of the existing power elite of Sicily. Finkelstein characterizes him as, &quot;a tool of the landowners and conservatives... manipulated to slaughter innocent peasants in the name of halting Communism.&quot; Hobsbawm notes ambiguity and naivete&#x27; in Giuliano&#x27;s political role:

Hobsbawm classifies Giuliano as a &quot;social bandit&quot;, which he defines as &quot;peasant outlaws whom the lord and state define as criminals, but who remain within peasant society, and are considered by their people as heroes, as champions, avengers, fighters for justice, perhaps even leaders of liberation, and in any case men to be admired, helped and supported.&quot; He further defines Giuliano as a member of the &quot;noble robbers&quot; subset of social bandits—Robin Hood being the prototype.

Central to Billy Jaynes Chandler&#x27;s analysis is Giuliano&#x27;s personality and psychology. The bandit definitely saw himself as a romantic, heroic figure. He mused about his epitaph: &quot;Here lies Giuliano, hero of Sicily.&quot; He made photos of himself heroically astride a horse, labeled, &quot;Robin Hood.&quot; He cultivated his image carefully, with an eye on history. He was, according to Chandler, audacious (turning the tables on the Carabinieri Christmas Eve, 1943), intelligent and astute (when negotiating with EVIS and, later, with Sicily&#x27;s power brokers). At the same time, he was unsophisticated and naive—an inexperienced village boy negotiating with far more worldly men when he played politics. Compounding his naivete&#x27; was his monumental ego and overly grand self-conception. Maria Lombardo shared his conception—she told Michael Stern that the three outstanding personages of history were Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and her son, Turi. Eric Hobsbawm agrees with Chandler&#x27;s assessment of the bandit, emphasizing the role of the MIS leaders in persuading Giuliano see himself as a major political player.

In historical context, Chandler concurs with Hobsbawm&#x27;s assessment of Giuliano as a &quot;heroic robber&quot;. Giuliano can also be interpreted through the prism of Samuel L. Popkin&#x27;s rational peasant concept, according to Chandler. The bandit&#x27;s acquisitive urge coincides well with the rational peasant model, and he and his mother engaged in mafia-like rational acquisitiveness by demanding a fee from a bakery attempting to open a branch in Montelepre. But his &quot;foolhardy, impulsive&quot; killing of a police officer in 1943 was the polar opposite of careful calculation. The ordinary peasants who joined his armed actions in the moments of greatest need were more rational—willing to take significant risks from time to time for a better payday than they would ordinarily earn in the difficult years after the war. Mafiosi arising from the peasantry are even better examples of rationality: their entire lives are dedicated to material acquisition.

Giuliano&#x27;s dearest wish was to be pardoned for his crimes, and the only people who could possibly accommodate him were the power elite of Sicily (and Italy)—and so he did business with them. As Chandler says, this made him &quot;above all else, an outlaw who accommodated himself to the existing structure of power.&quot; Hobsbawm again agrees with Chandler—with more emphasis on the politics and ideology of the situation.

Three residents of Montelepre during the years of Giuliano&#x27;s banditry have added their commentary to the historical record.

At a sparsely attended Separatist commemorative ceremony in 1980, his sister Mariannina gave her view of his character: &quot;He was good and honest. Turridu did what he did only from fear and out of poverty.&quot;

Padre diBella, Montelepre&#x27;s parish priest, summed up the tumult of the bandit&#x27;s life, and its effect on the village: &quot;And all this for a few bags of flour!&quot;

In spite of the hardship and misery experienced by the villagers during Giuliano&#x27;s banditry, one of them—Saverio—remarked to Tomaso Besozzi, &quot;What times those were, eh? When Giuliano was king of the mountain, and made the world tremble.&quot;

==Doubts about Giuliano&#x27;s death==
Over the years doubts about Giuliano&#x27;s death have been expressed. According to some Giuliano fled from Sicily to Tunis and went on to live in the United States. The historian Giuseppe Casarrubea, son of one of the victims of Giuliano, compiled material to demonstrate that the body buried as Giuliano belonged to someone else. On 15 October 2010, the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office in Palermo decided to exhume the body and compare its DNA with living relatives of Giuliano.

The DNA tests showed a 90% likelihood that the skeleton belongs to Giuliano. The DNA match between the skeleton and Giuliano&#x27;s relations means that Sicilian prosecutors are now archiving the probe they opened in 2010 into the possibility that someone was murdered and passed off as Giuliano.

==Dramatizations==

His life inspired the novel &quot;The Brigand&quot; which was adapted for Australian radio by Morris West as &quot;Fire of Etna&quot; (1953).

A film of his life, &quot;Salvatore Giuliano&quot;, was directed by Francesco Rosi in 1961. 

Novelist Mario Puzo published &quot;The Sicilian&quot;, a dramatized version of Giuliano&#x27;s life, in 1984. The book was made into a film in 1987, directed by Michael Cimino and starring Christopher Lambert as Giuliano.

An opera, &quot;Salvatore Giuliano&quot;, was composed in 1985 by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero and premiered on 25 January 1986 at Teatro dell&#x27;Opera di Roma. The libretto outlines in short, graphic scenes the network of intrigue between Sicilian independence activists, Mafia and State that surrounds, and eventually destroys, the bandit hero.

<text>A cascading failure is a failure in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts, growing progressively as a result of positive feedback. This can occur when a single part fails, increasing the probability that other portions of the system fail. Such a failure may happen in many types of systems, including power transmission, computer networking, finance, transportation systems, organisms, the human body, and ecosystems.

Cascading failures may occur when one part of the system fails. When this happens, other parts must then compensate for the failed component. This in turn overloads these nodes, causing them to fail as well, prompting additional nodes to fail one after another.

== In power transmission ==

Cascading failure is common in power grids when one of the elements fails (completely or partially) and shifts its load to nearby elements in the system. Those nearby elements are then pushed beyond their capacity so they become overloaded and shift their load onto other elements. Cascading failure is a common effect seen in high voltage systems, where a single point of failure (SPF) on a fully loaded or slightly overloaded system results in a sudden spike across all nodes of the system. This surge current can induce the already overloaded nodes into failure, setting off more overloads and thereby taking down the entire system in a very short time.

This failure process cascades through the elements of the system like a ripple on a pond and continues until substantially all of the elements in the system are compromised and/or the system becomes functionally disconnected from the source of its load. For example, under certain conditions a large power grid can collapse after the failure of a single transformer.

Monitoring the operation of a system, in real-time, and judicious disconnection of parts can help stop a cascade. Another common technique is to calculate a safety margin for the system by computer simulation of possible failures, to establish safe operating levels below which none of the calculated scenarios is predicted to cause cascading failure, and to identify the parts of the network which are most likely to cause cascading failures.

One of the primary problems with preventing electrical grid failures is that the speed of the control signal is no faster than the speed of the propagating power overload, i.e. since both the control signal and the electrical power are moving at the same speed, it is not possible to isolate the outage by sending a warning ahead to isolate the element.

=== Examples ===
Cascading failure caused the following power outages:
* Blackout in Northeast America in 1965
* Blackout in Southern Brazil in 1999
* Blackout in Northeast America in 2003
* Blackout in Italy in 2003
* Blackout in London in 2003
* European Blackout in 2006
* Blackout in Northern India in 2012
* Blackout in South Australia in 2016
* Blackout in southeast South America in 2019
* Countrywide blackout in Kenya 2022
* Countrywide blackout in Kenya 2023

== In computer networks ==

Cascading failures can also occur in computer networks (such as the Internet) in which network traffic is severely impaired or halted to or between larger sections of the network, caused by failing or disconnected hardware or software. In this context, the cascading failure is known by the term cascade failure. A cascade failure can affect large groups of people and systems.

The cause of a cascade failure is usually the overloading of a single, crucial router or node, which causes the node to go down, even briefly. It can also be caused by taking a node down for maintenance or upgrades. In either case, traffic is routed to or through another (alternative) path. This alternative path, as a result, becomes overloaded, causing it to go down, and so on. It will also affect systems which depend on the node for regular operation.

=== Symptoms ===

The symptoms of a cascade failure include: packet loss and high network latency, not just to single systems, but to whole sections of a network or the internet. The high latency and packet loss is caused by the nodes that fail to operate due to congestion collapse, which causes them to still be present in the network but without much or any useful communication going through them. As a result, routes can still be considered valid, without them actually providing communication.

If enough routes go down because of a cascade failure, a complete section of the network or internet can become unreachable. Although undesired, this can help speed up the recovery from this failure as connections will time out, and other nodes will give up trying to establish connections to the section(s) that have become cut off, decreasing load on the involved nodes.

A common occurrence during a cascade failure is a walking failure, where sections go down, causing the next section to fail, after which the first section comes back up. This ripple can make several passes through the same sections or connecting nodes before stability is restored.

=== History ===

Cascade failures are a relatively recent development, with the massive increase in traffic and the high interconnectivity between systems and networks. The term was first applied in this context in the late 1990s by a Dutch IT professional and has slowly become a relatively common term for this kind of large-scale failure.

=== Example ===

Network failures typically start when a single network node fails. Initially, the traffic that would normally go through the node is stopped. Systems and users get errors about not being able to reach hosts. Usually, the redundant systems of an ISP respond very quickly, choosing another path through a different backbone. The routing path through this alternative route is longer, with more hops and subsequently going through more systems that normally do not process the amount of traffic suddenly offered.

This can cause one or more systems along the alternative route to go down, creating similar problems of their own.

Related systems are also affected in this case. As an example, DNS resolution might fail and what would normally cause systems to be interconnected, might break connections that are not even directly involved in the actual systems that went down. This, in turn, may cause seemingly unrelated nodes to develop problems, that can cause another cascade failure all on its own.

In December 2012, a partial loss (40%) of Gmail service occurred globally, for 18 minutes. This loss of service was caused by a routine update of load balancing software which contained faulty logic—in this case, the error was caused by logic using an inappropriate &#x27;all&#x27; instead of the more appropriate &#x27;some&#x27;. The cascading error was fixed by fully updating a single node in the network instead of partially updating all nodes at one time.

== Cascading structural failure ==
Certain load-bearing structures with discrete structural components can be subject to the &quot;zipper effect&quot;, where the failure of a single structural member increases the load on adjacent members. In the case of the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse, a suspended walkway (which was already overstressed due to an error in construction) failed when a single vertical suspension rod failed, overloading the neighboring rods which failed sequentially (i.e. like a zipper). A bridge that can have such a failure is called fracture critical, and numerous bridge collapses have been caused by the failure of a single part. Properly designed structures use an adequate factor of safety and/or alternate load paths to prevent this type of mechanical cascade failure.

===Fracture cascade===

Fracture cascade is a phenomenon in the context of geology and describes triggering a chain reaction of subsequent fractures by a single fracture. The initial fracture leads to the propagation of additional fractures, causing a cascading effect throughout the material.

Fracture cascades can occur in various materials, including rocks, ice, metals, and ceramics. A common example is the bending of dry spaghetti, which in most cases breaks into more than 2 pieces, as first observed by Richard Feynman.

In the context of osteoporosis, a fracture cascade is the increased risk of subsequent bone fractures after an initial one.

== Other examples ==

=== Biology ===
Biochemical cascades exist in biology, where a small reaction can have system-wide implications. One negative example is ischemic cascade, in which a small ischemic attack releases toxins which kill off far more cells than the initial damage, resulting in more toxins being released. Current research is to find a way to block this cascade in stroke patients to minimize the damage.

In the study of extinction, sometimes the extinction of one species will cause many other extinctions to happen. Such a species is known as a keystone species.

=== Electronics ===
Another example is the Cockcroft–Walton generator, which can also experience cascade failures wherein one failed diode can result in all the diodes failing in a fraction of a second.

Yet another example of this effect in a scientific experiment was the implosion in 2001 of several thousand fragile glass photomultiplier tubes used in the Super-Kamiokande experiment, where the shock wave caused by the failure of a single detector appears to have triggered the implosion of the other detectors in a chain reaction.

=== Finance ===
In finance, the risk of cascading failures of financial institutions is referred to as &quot;systemic risk:&quot; the failure of one financial institution may cause other financial institutions (its counterparties) to fail, cascading throughout the system. Institutions that are believed to pose systemic risk are deemed either &quot;too big to fail&quot; (TBTF) or &quot;too interconnected to fail&quot; (TICTF), depending on why they appear to pose a threat.

Note however that systemic risk is not due to individual institutions per se, but due to the interconnections. Frameworks to study and predict the effects of cascading failures have been developed in the research literature.

A related (though distinct) type of cascading failure in finance occurs in the stock market, exemplified by the 2010 Flash Crash.

== Interdependent cascading failures ==
Diverse infrastructures such as water supply, transportation, fuel and power stations are coupled together and depend on each other for functioning, see Fig. 1. Owing to this coupling, interdependent networks are extremely sensitive to random failures, and in particular to targeted attacks, such that a failure of a small fraction of nodes in one network can trigger an iterative cascade of failures in several interdependent networks. Electrical blackouts frequently result from a cascade of failures between interdependent networks, and the problem has been dramatically exemplified by the several large-scale blackouts that have occurred in recent years. Blackouts are a fascinating demonstration of the important role played by the dependencies between networks. For example, the 2003 Italy blackout resulted in a widespread failure of the railway network, health care systems, and financial services and, in addition, severely influenced the telecommunication networks. The partial failure of the communication system in turn further impaired the electrical grid management system, thus producing a positive feedback on the power grid. This example emphasizes how inter-dependence can significantly magnify the damage in an interacting network system.

== Model for overload cascading failures ==
A model for cascading failures due to overload propagation is the Motter–Lai model.

<doc id="297025" wikidata="Q741623" url="?curid=297025" title="Hiroshi Teshigahara">
<text>was a Japanese avant-garde filmmaker and artist from the Japanese New Wave era. He is best known for the 1964 film &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot;. He is also known for directing other titles such as &quot;The Face of Another&quot; (1966), &quot;Natsu no Heitai&quot; (&quot;Summer Soldiers&quot;, 1972), and &quot;Pitfall&quot; (1962), which was Teshigahara&#x27;s directorial debut. He has been called &quot;one of the most acclaimed Japanese directors of all time&quot;. Teshigahara is the first person of Asian descent to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director, accomplishing this in 1964 for his work on &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot;. Apart from being a filmmaker, Teshigahara also practiced other arts, such as calligraphy, pottery, painting, opera and ikebana.

== Biography ==
Teshigahara was born in Tokyo, the son of Sōfu Teshigahara, founder and grand master of the Sōgetsu-ryū school of &quot;ikebana&quot;. He graduated in 1950 from the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music and began working in documentary film. He directed his first feature film, &quot;Pitfall&quot; (1962), in collaboration with author Kōbō Abe and musician Toru Takemitsu. The film won the NHK New Director&#x27;s award, and throughout the 1960s, he continued to collaborate on films with Abe and Takemitsu while simultaneously pursuing his interest in &quot;ikebana&quot; and sculpture on a professional level.

In 1965, the Teshigahara/Abe film &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot; (1964) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and won the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Although the original director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot; was 147 minutes, he cut it down to 124 minutes when he was invited to the Cannes Film Festival. In 1972, he worked with Japanese researcher and translator John Nathan to make &quot;Summer Soldiers&quot;, a film set during the Vietnam War about American deserters living on the fringe of Japanese society.

From the mid-1970s onwards, he worked less frequently on feature films as he concentrated more on documentaries, exhibitions and the Sogetsu School and became grand master of the school in 1980.

In 1980, after the death of his father, Teshigahara became the third generation Iemoto of Sogetsu School, using bamboo at his large-scale solo exhibitions at several well known museums, including the National Museum of Contemporary Art in Seoul, Korea (1989), Palazzo Reale in Milan, Italy (1995), and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. (1996), among other venues. In Japan, Teshigahara displayed his art installations nationwide, including Gen-Ichiro Inokuma Museum of Contemporary Art in Marugame and Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art. In the 1990s, he pushed the art form of renka, which is a series of impromptu Ikebana arranged by multiple artists. Teshigahara was also involved in ceramics calligraphy and installation art.

Throughout his career, Teshigahara also involved himself in stage and art direction, both domestically and internationally. He has directed performances such as the opera Turandot (Lyon, France, 1992; Geneva, Switzerland, 1996), and original Noh play Susanoh (the Avignon Theatre Festival, 1994), Sloka by Chandralekha Dance Company (1999), and original outdoor dance play Susano Iden (1991).

==Collections==
In 1983, Teshigahara created a permanent installation at the Ken Domon Museum, Sakata, Japan.

==Death and legacy==

Teshigahara died at the age of 74 on April 14, 2001, in his hometown, Tokyo, Japan.

On the first anniversary of his death, April 14, 2002, a DVD box set containing his best known work was released in Japan in commemoration.

<text>Monetary policy is the policy adopted by the monetary authority of a nation to affect monetary and other financial conditions to accomplish broader objectives like high employment and price stability (normally interpreted as a low and stable rate of inflation). Further purposes of a monetary policy may be to contribute to economic stability or to maintain predictable exchange rates with other currencies. Today most central banks in developed countries conduct their monetary policy within an inflation targeting framework, whereas the monetary policies of most developing countries&#x27; central banks target some kind of a fixed exchange rate system. A third monetary policy strategy, targeting the money supply, was widely followed during the 1980s, but has diminished in popularity since then, though it is still the official strategy in a number of emerging economies.

The tools of monetary policy vary from central bank to central bank, depending on the country&#x27;s stage of development, institutional structure, tradition and political system. Interest-rate targeting is generally the primary tool, being obtained either directly via administratively changing the central bank&#x27;s own interest rates or indirectly via open market operations. Interest rates affect general economic activity and consequently employment and inflation via a number of different channels, known collectively as the monetary transmission mechanism, and are also an important determinant of the exchange rate. Other policy tools include communication strategies like forward guidance and in some countries the setting of reserve requirements. Monetary policy is often referred to as being either expansionary (stimulating economic activity and consequently employment and inflation) or contractionary (dampening economic activity, hence decreasing employment and inflation).

Monetary policy affects the economy through financial channels like interest rates, exchange rates and prices of financial assets. This is in contrast to fiscal policy, which relies on changes in taxation and government spending as methods for a government to manage business cycle phenomena such as recessions. In developed countries, monetary policy is generally formed separately from fiscal policy, modern central banks in developed economies being independent of direct government control and directives.

How best to conduct monetary policy is an active and debated research area, drawing on fields like monetary economics as well as other subfields within macroeconomics.

==History==

=== Issuing coin===
Monetary policy has evolved over the centuries, along with the development of a money economy. Historians, economists, anthropologists and numismatics do not agree on the origins of money. In the West the common point of view is that coins were first used in ancient Lydia in the 8th century BCE, whereas some date the origins to ancient China. The earliest predecessors to monetary policy seem to be those of debasement, where the government would melt coins down and mix them with cheaper metals. The practice was widespread in the late Roman Empire, but reached its perfection in western Europe in the late Middle Ages.

For many centuries there were only two forms of monetary policy: altering coinage or the printing of paper money. Interest rates, while now thought of as part of monetary authority, were not generally coordinated with the other forms of monetary policy during this time. Monetary policy was considered as an executive decision, and was generally implemented by the authority with seigniorage (the power to coin). With the advent of larger trading networks came the ability to define the currency value in terms of gold or silver, and the price of the local currency in terms of foreign currencies. This official price could be enforced by law, even if it varied from the market price.

Paper money originated from promissory notes termed &quot;jiaozi&quot; in 7th-century China. Jiaozi did not replace metallic currency, and were used alongside the copper coins. The succeeding Yuan dynasty was the first government to use paper currency as the predominant circulating medium. In the later course of the dynasty, facing massive shortages of specie to fund war and maintain their rule, they began printing paper money without restrictions, resulting in hyperinflation.

=== Central banks and the gold standard ===

With the creation of the Bank of England in 1694, which was granted the authority to print notes backed by gold, the idea of monetary policy as independent of executive action began to be established. The purpose of monetary policy was to maintain the value of the coinage, print notes which would trade at par to specie, and prevent coins from leaving circulation. During the period 1870–1920, the industrialized nations established central banking systems, with one of the last being the Federal Reserve in 1913. By this time the role of the central bank as the &quot;lender of last resort&quot; was established. It was also increasingly understood that interest rates had an effect on the entire economy, in no small part because of appreciation for the marginal revolution in economics, which demonstrated that people would change their decisions based on changes in their opportunity costs.

The establishment of national banks by industrializing nations was associated then with the desire to maintain the currency&#x27;s relationship to the gold standard, and to trade in a narrow currency band with other gold-backed currencies. To accomplish this end, central banks as part of the gold standard began setting the interest rates that they charged both their own borrowers and other banks which required money for liquidity. The maintenance of a gold standard required almost monthly adjustments of interest rates.

The gold standard is a system by which the price of the national currency is fixed vis-a-vis the value of gold, and is kept constant by the government&#x27;s promise to buy or sell gold at a fixed price in terms of the base currency. The gold standard might be regarded as a special case of &quot;fixed exchange rate&quot; policy, or as a special type of commodity price level targeting. However, the policies required to maintain the gold standard might be harmful to employment and general economic activity and probably exacerbated the Great Depression in the 1930s in many countries, leading eventually to the demise of the gold standards and efforts to create a more adequate monetary framework internationally after World War II. Nowadays the gold standard is no longer used by any country.

=== Fixed exchange rates prevailing ===

In 1944, the Bretton Woods system was established, which created the International Monetary Fund and introduced a fixed exchange rate system linking the currencies of most industrialized nations to the US dollar, which as the only currency in the system would be directly convertible to gold. During the following decades the system secured stable exchange rates internationally, but the system broke down during the 1970s when the dollar increasingly came to be viewed as overvalued. In 1971, the dollar&#x27;s convertibility into gold was suspended. Attempts to revive the fixed exchange rates failed, and by 1973 the major currencies began to float against each other. In Europe, various attempts were made to establish a regional fixed exchange rate system via the European Monetary System, leading eventually to the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union and the introduction of the currency euro.

=== Money supply targets ===

Monetarist economists long contended that the money-supply growth could affect the macroeconomy. These included Milton Friedman who early in his career advocated that government budget deficits during recessions be financed in equal amount by money creation to help to stimulate aggregate demand for production. Later he advocated simply increasing the monetary supply at a low, constant rate, as the best way of maintaining low inflation and stable production growth. During the 1970s inflation rose in many countries caused by the 1970s energy crisis, and several central banks turned to a money supply target in an attempt to reduce inflation. However, when U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker tried this policy, starting in October 1979, it was found to be impractical, because of the unstable relationship between monetary aggregates and other macroeconomic variables, and similar results prevailed in other countries. Even Milton Friedman later acknowledged that direct money supplying was less successful than he had hoped.

=== Inflation targeting ===

In 1990, New Zealand as the first country ever adopted an official inflation target as the basis of its monetary policy. The idea is that the central bank tries to adjust interest rates in order to steer the country&#x27;s inflation rate towards the official target instead of following indirect objectives like exchange rate stability or money supply growth, the purpose of which is normally also ultimately to obtain low and stable inflation. The strategy was generally considered to work well, and central banks in most developed countries have over the years adapted a similar strategy.

The Global Financial Crisis of 2008 sparked controversy over the use and flexibility of the inflation targeting employed. Many economists argued that the actual inflation targets decided upon were set too low by many monetary regimes. During the crisis, many inflation-anchoring countries reached the lower bound of zero rates, resulting in inflation rates decreasing to almost zero or even deflation.

As of 2023, the central banks of all G7 member countries can be said to follow an inflation target, including the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve, who have adopted the main elements of inflation targeting without officially calling themselves inflation targeters. In emerging countries fixed exchange rate regimes are still the most common monetary policy.

== Monetary policy instruments ==

The instruments available to central banks for conducting monetary policy vary from country to country, depending on the country&#x27;s stage of development, institutional structure and political system. The main monetary policy instruments available to central banks are interest rate policy, i.e. setting (administered) interest rates directly, open market operations, forward guidance and other communication activities, bank reserve requirements, and re-lending and re-discount (including using the term repurchase market). While capital adequacy is important, it is defined and regulated by the Bank for International Settlements, and central banks in practice generally do not apply stricter rules.

Expansionary policy occurs when a monetary authority uses its instruments to stimulate the economy. An expansionary policy decreases short-term interest rates, affecting broader financial conditions to encourage spending on goods and services, in turn leading to increased employment. By affecting the exchange rate, it may also stimulate net export. Contractionary policy works in the opposite direction: Increasing interest rates will depress borrowing and spending by consumers and businesses, dampening inflationary pressure in the economy together with employment.

=== Key interest rates ===
For most central banks in advanced economies, their main monetary policy instrument is a short-term interest rate. For monetary policy frameworks operating under an exchange rate anchor, adjusting interest rates are, together with direct intervention in the foreign exchange market (i.e. open market operations), important tools to maintain the desired exchange rate. For central banks targeting inflation directly, adjusting interest rates are crucial for the monetary transmission mechanism which ultimately affects inflation. Changes in the central bank policy rates normally affect the interest rates that banks and other lenders charge on loans to firms and households.

Higher interest rates reduce inflation by reducing aggregate consumption of goods and services by several causal paths. Higher borrowing costs can cause a cash shortage for companies, which then reduce direct spending on goods and services to reduce costs. They also tend to reduce spending on labor, which in turn reduces household income and then household spending on goods and services. Interest rate changes also affect asset prices like stock prices and house prices. Though unless they are selling or taking out new loans their cash flow is unaffected, asset owners feel less wealthy (the wealth effect) and reduce spending.

Rising interest rates also have smaller secondary effects, which decrease supply and tend to increase inflation (or cause it to decrease more slowly than it otherwise would. On the individual side, rising mortgage rates disincentivize wealthy homeowners from downsizing or moving to a new home if they have an existing mortgage that is locked in at a low fixed rate. On the business side, lower investment and spending may result in lower supply of new homes and other goods and services.

Firms experiencing high borrowing costs are also less willing or able to borrow or spend money on investment in new or expanding business. International interest rate differentials also affect exchange rates, and consequently exports and imports. Consumption, investment, and net exports are all important components of aggregate demand. Stimulating or suppressing the overall demand for goods and services in the economy will tend to increase respectively diminish inflation.

The concrete implementation mechanism used to adjust short-term interest rates differs from central bank to central bank. The &quot;policy rate&quot; itself, i.e. the main interest rate which the central bank uses to communicate its policy, may be either an administered rate (i.e. set directly by the central bank) or a market interest rate which the central bank influences only indirectly. By setting administered rates that commercial banks and possibly other financial institutions will receive for their deposits in the central bank, respectively pay for loans from the central bank, the central monetary authority can create a band (or &quot;corridor&quot;) within which market interbank short-term interest rates will typically move. Depending on the specific details, the resulting specific market interest rate may either be created by open market operations by the central bank (a so-called &quot;corridor system&quot;) or in practice equal the administered rate (a &quot;floor system&quot;, practiced by the Federal Reserve among others).

As an example of how this functions, the Bank of Canada sets a target overnight rate, and a band of plus or minus 0.25%. Qualified banks borrow from each other within this band, but never above or below, because the central bank will always lend to them at the top of the band, and take deposits at the bottom of the band; in principle, the capacity to borrow and lend at the extremes of the band are unlimited.
The target rates are generally short-term rates. The actual rate that borrowers and lenders receive on the market will depend on (perceived) credit risk, maturity and other factors. For example, a central bank might set a target rate for overnight lending of 4.5%, but rates for (equivalent risk) five-year bonds might be 5%, 4.75%, or, in cases of inverted yield curves, even below the short-term rate.

Many central banks have one primary &quot;headline&quot; rate that is quoted as the &quot;central bank rate&quot;. In practice, they will have other tools and rates that are used, but only one that is rigorously targeted and enforced. A typical central bank consequently has several interest rates or monetary policy tools it can use to influence markets.

* Marginal lending rate – a fixed rate for institutions to borrow money from the central bank. (In the United States, this is called the discount rate).
* Main refinancing rate – the publicly visible interest rate the central bank announces. It is also known as &quot;minimum bid rate&quot; and serves as a bidding floor for refinancing loans. (In the United States, this is called the federal funds rate).
* Deposit rate, generally consisting of interest on reserves – the rates parties receive for deposits at the central bank.

=== Open market operations ===

Through open market operations, a central bank may influence the level of interest rates, the exchange rate and/or the money supply in an economy. Open market operations can influence interest rates by expanding or contracting the monetary base, which consists of currency in circulation and banks&#x27; reserves on deposit at the central bank. Each time a central bank buys securities (such as a government bond or treasury bill), it in effect creates money. The central bank exchanges money for the security, increasing the monetary base while lowering the supply of the specific security. Conversely, selling of securities by the central bank reduces the monetary base. Open market operations usually take the form of:

* Buying or selling securities (&quot;direct operations&quot;).
* Temporary lending of money for collateral securities (&quot;Reverse Operations&quot; or &quot;repurchase operations&quot;, otherwise known as the &quot;repo&quot; market). These operations are carried out on a regular basis, where fixed maturity loans (of one week and one month for the ECB) are auctioned off.
* Foreign exchange operations such as foreign exchange swaps.

=== Forward guidance ===

Forward guidance is a communication practice whereby the central bank announces its forecasts and future intentions to influence market expectations of future levels of interest rates. As expectations formation are an important ingredient in actual inflation changes, credible communication is important for modern central banks.

=== Reserve requirements ===

Historically, bank reserves have formed only a small fraction of deposits, a system called fractional-reserve banking. Banks would hold only a small percentage of their assets in the form of cash reserves as insurance against bank runs. Over time this process has been regulated and insured by central banks. Such legal reserve requirements were introduced in the 19th century as an attempt to reduce the risk of banks overextending themselves and suffering from bank runs, as this could lead to knock-on effects on other overextended banks.

A number of central banks have since abolished their reserve requirements over the last few decades, beginning with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in 1985 and continuing with the Federal Reserve in 2020. For the respective banking systems, bank capital requirements provide a check on the growth of the money supply.

The People&#x27;s Bank of China retains (and uses) more powers over reserves because the yuan that it manages is a non-convertible currency.

Loan activity by banks plays a fundamental role in determining the money supply. The central bank money after aggregate settlement – &quot;final money&quot; – can take only one of two forms:

* physical cash, which is rarely used in wholesale financial markets,
* central bank money which is rarely used by the people

The currency component of the money supply is far smaller than the deposit component. Currency, bank reserves and institutional loan agreements together make up the monetary base, called M1, M2 and M3. The Federal Reserve Bank stopped publishing M3 and counting it as part of the money supply in 2006.

=== Credit guidance ===

Central banks can directly or indirectly influence the allocation of bank lending in certain sectors of the economy by applying quotas, limits or differentiated interest rates. This allows the central bank to control both the quantity of lending and its allocation towards certain strategic sectors of the economy, for example to support the national industrial policy, or to environmental investment such as housing renovation.

The Bank of Japan used to apply such policy (&quot;window guidance&quot;) between 1962 and 1991. The Banque de France also widely used credit guidance during the post-war period of 1948 until 1973 . China is also applying a form of dual rate policy.

The European Central Bank&#x27;s ongoing TLTROs operations can also be described as a form of credit guidance insofar as the level of interest rate ultimately paid by banks is differentiated according to the volume of lending made by commercial banks at the end of the maintenance period. If commercial banks achieve a certain lending performance threshold, they get a discount interest rate, that is lower than the standard key interest rate. For this reason, some economists have described the TLTROs as a &quot;dual interest rates&quot; policy.

Civil society organizations and think tanks have proposed the introduction of a &quot;green TLTRO&quot; in order to lower the cost of funding and stimulate bank lending targeted at green projects, echoing the French President Emmanual Macron, who called for introducing &quot;green interest rates&quot;.

In 2021, the Bank of Japan and People&#x27;s Bank of China have introduced differentiated interest rates on green dedicated refinancing operations.

=== Exchange requirements ===
To influence the money supply, some central banks may require that some or all foreign exchange receipts (generally from exports) be exchanged for the local currency. The rate that is used to purchase local currency may be market-based or arbitrarily set by the bank. This tool is generally used in countries with non-convertible currencies or partially convertible currencies. The recipient of the local currency may be allowed to freely dispose of the funds, required to hold the funds with the central bank for some period of time, or allowed to use the funds subject to certain restrictions. In other cases, the ability to hold or use the foreign exchange may be otherwise limited.

In this method, the money supply is increased by the central bank when it purchases the foreign currency by issuing (selling) the local currency. The central bank may subsequently reduce the money supply by various means, including selling bonds or foreign exchange interventions.

=== Collateral policy ===
In some countries, central banks may have other tools that work indirectly to limit lending practices and otherwise restrict or regulate capital markets. For example, a central bank may regulate margin lending, whereby individuals or companies may borrow against pledged securities. The margin requirement establishes a minimum ratio of the value of the securities to the amount borrowed.

Central banks often have requirements for the quality of assets that may be held by financial institutions; these requirements may act as a limit on the amount of risk and leverage created by the financial system. These requirements may be direct, such as requiring certain assets to bear certain minimum credit ratings, or indirect, by the central bank lending to counterparties only when the security of a certain quality is pledged as collateral.

===Unconventional monetary policy at the zero bound===
Other forms of monetary policy, particularly used when interest rates are at or near 0% and there are concerns about deflation or deflation is occurring, are referred to as unconventional monetary policy. These include credit easing, quantitative easing, forward guidance, and signalling. In credit easing, a central bank purchases private sector assets to improve liquidity and improve access to credit. Signaling can be used to lower market expectations for lower interest rates in the future. For example, during the credit crisis of 2008, the US Federal Reserve indicated rates would be low for an &quot;extended period&quot;, and the Bank of Canada made a &quot;conditional commitment&quot; to keep rates at the lower bound of 25 basis points (0.25%) until the end of the second quarter of 2010.

==== Helicopter money ====

Further similar monetary policy proposals include the idea of helicopter money whereby central banks would create money without assets as counterpart in their balance sheet. The money created could be distributed directly to the population as a citizen&#x27;s dividend. Virtues of such money shocks include the decrease of household risk aversion and the increase in demand, boosting both inflation and the output gap. This option has been increasingly discussed since March 2016 after the ECB&#x27;s president Mario Draghi said he found the concept &quot;very interesting&quot;. The idea was also promoted by prominent former central bankers Stanley Fischer and Philipp Hildebrand in a paper published by BlackRock, and in France by economists Philippe Martin and Xavier Ragot from the French Council for Economic Analysis, a think tank attached to the Prime minister&#x27;s office.

Some have envisaged the use of what Milton Friedman once called &quot;helicopter money&quot; whereby the central bank would make direct transfers to citizens in order to lift inflation up to the central bank&#x27;s intended target. Such a policy option could be particularly effective at the zero lower bound.

==Nominal anchors==

Central banks typically use a nominal anchor to pin down expectations of private agents about the nominal price level or its path or about what the central bank might do with respect to achieving that path. A nominal anchor is a variable that is thought to bear a stable relationship to the price level or the rate of inflation over some period of time. The adoption of a nominal anchor is intended to stabilize inflation expectations, which may, in turn, help stabilize actual inflation. Nominal variables historically used as anchors include the gold standard, exchange rate targets, money supply targets, and since the 1990s direct official inflation targets. In addition, economic researchers have proposed variants or alternatives like price level targeting (some times described as an inflation target with a memory) or nominal income targeting.

Empirically, some researchers suggest that central banks&#x27; policies can be described by a simple method called the Taylor rule, according to which central banks adjust their policy interest rate in response to changes in the inflation rate and the output gap. The rule was proposed by John B. Taylor of Stanford University.

=== Inflation targeting ===
Under this policy approach, the official target is to keep inflation, under a particular definition such as the Consumer Price Index, within a desired range. Thus, while other monetary regimes usually also have as their ultimate goal to control inflation, they go about it in an indirect way, whereas inflation targeting employs a more direct approach.

The inflation target is achieved through periodic adjustments to the central bank interest rate target. In addition, clear communication to the public about the central bank&#x27;s actions and future expectations is an essential part of the strategy, in itself influencing inflation expectations which are considered crucial for actual inflation developments.

Typically the duration that the interest rate target is kept constant will vary between months and years. This interest rate target is usually reviewed on a monthly or quarterly basis by a policy committee. Changes to the interest rate target are made in response to various market indicators in an attempt to forecast economic trends and in so doing keep the market on track towards achieving the defined inflation target.

The inflation targeting approach to monetary policy approach was pioneered in New Zealand. Since 1990, an increasing number of countries have switched to inflation targeting as their monetary policy framework. It is used in, among other countries, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Iceland, India, Philippines, Poland, Sweden, South Africa, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. In 2022, the International Monetary Fund registered that 45 economies used inflation targeting as their monetary policy framework. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are generally considered to follow a strategy very close to inflation targeting, even though they do not officially label themselves as inflation targeters. Inflation targeting thus has become the world&#x27;s dominant monetary policy framework. However, critics contend that there are unintended consequences to this approach such as fueling the increase in housing prices and contributing to wealth inequalities by supporting higher equity values.

=== Fixed exchange rate targeting ===
This policy is based on maintaining a fixed exchange rate with a foreign currency. There are varying degrees of fixed exchange rates, which can be ranked in relation to how rigid the fixed exchange rate is with the anchor nation.

Under a system of fiat fixed rates, the local government or monetary authority declares a fixed exchange rate but does not actively buy or sell currency to maintain the rate. Instead, the rate is enforced by non-convertibility measures (e.g. capital controls, import/export licenses, etc.). In this case, there is a black market exchange rate where the currency trades at its market/unofficial rate.

Under a system of fixed convertibility, currency is bought and sold by the central bank or monetary authority on a daily basis to achieve the target exchange rate. This target rate may be a fixed level or a fixed band within which the exchange rate may fluctuate until the monetary authority intervenes to buy or sell as necessary to maintain the exchange rate within the band. (In this case, the fixed exchange rate with a fixed level can be seen as a special case of the fixed exchange rate with bands where the bands are set to zero.)

Under a system of fixed exchange rates maintained by a currency board every unit of local currency must be backed by a unit of foreign currency (correcting for the exchange rate). This ensures that the local monetary base does not inflate without being backed by hard currency and eliminates any worries about a run on the local currency by those wishing to convert the local currency to the hard (anchor) currency.

Under dollarization, foreign currency (usually the US dollar, hence the term &quot;dollarization&quot;) is used freely as the medium of exchange either exclusively or in parallel with local currency. This outcome can come about because the local population has lost all faith in the local currency, or it may also be a policy of the government (usually to rein in inflation and import credible monetary policy).

Theoretically, using relative purchasing power parity (PPP), the rate of depreciation of the home country&#x27;s currency must equal the inflation differential:

:rate of depreciation = home inflation rate – foreign inflation rate,

which implies that

:home inflation rate = foreign inflation rate + rate of depreciation.

The anchor variable is the rate of depreciation. Therefore, the rate of inflation at home must equal the rate of inflation in the foreign country plus the rate of depreciation of the exchange rate of the home country currency, relative to the other.

With a strict fixed exchange rate or a peg, the rate of depreciation of the exchange rate is set equal to zero. In the case of a crawling peg, the rate of depreciation is set equal to a constant. With a limited flexible band, the rate of depreciation is allowed to fluctuate within a given range.

By fixing the rate of depreciation, PPP theory concludes that the home country&#x27;s inflation rate must depend on the foreign country&#x27;s.

Countries may decide to use a fixed exchange rate monetary regime in order to take advantage of price stability and control inflation. In practice, more than half of nations’ monetary regimes use fixed exchange rate anchoring. The great majority of these are emerging economies, Denmark being the only OECD member in 2022 maintaining an exchange rate anchor according to the IMF.

These policies often abdicate monetary policy to the foreign monetary authority or government as monetary policy in the pegging nation must align with monetary policy in the anchor nation to maintain the exchange rate. The degree to which local monetary policy becomes dependent on the anchor nation depends on factors such as capital mobility, openness, credit channels and other economic factors.

=== Money supply targeting ===
In the 1980s, several countries used an approach based on a constant growth in the money supply. This approach was refined to include different classes of money and credit (M0, M1, etc.) The approach was influenced by the theoretical school of thought called monetarism. In the US this approach to monetary policy was discontinued with the selection of Alan Greenspan as Fed Chairman.

Central banks might choose to set a money supply growth target as a nominal anchor to keep prices stable in the long term. The quantity theory is a long run model, which links price levels to money supply and demand. Using this equation, we can rearrange to see the following:

:π = μ − g,

where π is the inflation rate, μ is the money supply growth rate and g is the real output growth rate. This equation suggests that controlling the money supply&#x27;s growth rate can ultimately lead to price stability in the long run. To use this nominal anchor, a central bank would need to set μ equal to a constant and commit to maintaining this target. While monetary policy typically focuses on a price signal of one form or another, this approach is focused on monetary quantities.

However, targeting the money supply growth rate was not a success in practice because the relationship between inflation, economic activity, and measures of money growth turned out to be unstable. Consequently, the importance of the money supply as a guide for the conduct of monetary policy has diminished over time, and after the 1980s central banks have shifted away from policies that focus on money supply targeting. Today, it is widely considered a weak policy, because it is not stably related to the growth of real output. As a result, a higher output growth rate will result in a too low level of inflation. A low output growth rate will result in inflation that would be higher than the desired level.

Later research suggests this apparent instability in money demand relationship may have stemmed from measurement error in traditional simple-sum monetary aggregates, which problematically treat all monetary assets as perfect substitutes. Divisia monetary aggregates developed by Barnett (1980), which appropriately weight components based on their user costs and liquidity services, demonstrate more stable relationships with economic variables. Studies by Belongia (1996) and Hendrickson (2014) show many findings of unstable money demand can be reversed when using Divisia rather than simple-sum measures, suggesting measurement methods rather than fundamental economic relationships may have been the key issue. Monetary policy rules targeting properly measured monetary aggregates may better characterize central bank actions, particularly during recessions and zero lower bound periods.

In 2022, the International Monetary Fund registered that 25 economies, all of them emerging economies, used some monetary aggregate target as their monetary policy framework.

=== Nominal income/NGDP targeting ===

Related to money targeting, nominal income targeting (also called Nominal GDP or NGDP targeting), originally proposed by James Meade (1978) and James Tobin (1980), was advocated by Scott Sumner and reinforced by the market monetarist school of thought.

So far, no central banks have implemented this monetary policy. However, various academic studies indicate that such a monetary policy targeting would better match central bank losses and welfare optimizing monetary policy compared to more standard monetary policy targeting.

=== Price level targeting ===
Price level targeting is a monetary policy that is similar to inflation targeting except that CPI growth in one year over or under the long-term price level target is offset in subsequent years such that a targeted price-level trend is reached over time, e.g. five years, giving more certainty about future price increases to consumers. Under inflation targeting what happened in the immediate past years is not taken into account or adjusted for in the current and future years.

=== Nominal anchors and exchange rate regimes ===

The different types of policy are also called monetary regimes, in parallel to exchange-rate regimes. A fixed exchange rate is also an exchange-rate regime. The gold standard results in a relatively fixed regime towards the currency of other countries following a gold standard and a floating regime towards those that are not. Targeting inflation, the price level or other monetary aggregates implies floating the exchange rate.

==Credibility==

The short-term effects of monetary policy can be influenced by the degree to which announcements of new policy are deemed credible. In particular, when an anti-inflation policy is announced by a central bank, in the absence of credibility in the eyes of the public inflationary expectations will not drop, and the short-run effect of the announcement and a subsequent sustained anti-inflation policy is likely to be a combination of somewhat lower inflation and higher unemployment (see Phillips curve § NAIRU and rational expectations). But if the policy announcement is deemed credible, inflationary expectations will drop commensurately with the announced policy intent, and inflation is likely to come down more quickly and without so much of a cost in terms of unemployment.

Thus there can be an advantage to having the central bank be independent of the political authority, to shield it from the prospect of political pressure to reverse the direction of the policy. But even with a seemingly independent central bank, a central bank whose hands are not tied to the anti-inflation policy might be deemed as not fully credible; in this case, there is an advantage to be had by the central bank being in some way bound to follow through on its policy pronouncements, lending it credibility.

There is very strong consensus among economists that an independent central bank can run a more credible monetary policy, making market expectations more responsive to signals from the central bank.

==Contexts==

===In international economics===
Optimal monetary policy in international economics is concerned with the question of how monetary policy should be conducted in interdependent open economies. The classical view holds that international macroeconomic interdependence is only relevant if it affects domestic output gaps and inflation, and monetary policy prescriptions can abstract from openness without harm. This view rests on two implicit assumptions: a high responsiveness of import prices to the exchange rate, i.e. producer currency pricing (PCP), and frictionless international financial markets supporting the efficiency of flexible price allocation. The violation or distortion of these assumptions found in empirical research is the subject of a substantial part of the international optimal monetary policy literature. The policy trade-offs specific to this international perspective are threefold:

First, research suggests only a weak reflection of exchange rate movements in import prices, lending credibility to the opposed theory of local currency pricing (LCP). The consequence is a departure from the classical view in the form of a trade-off between output gaps and misalignments in international relative prices, shifting monetary policy to CPI inflation control and real exchange rate stabilization.

Second, another specificity of international optimal monetary policy is the issue of strategic interactions and competitive devaluations, which is due to cross-border spillovers in quantities and prices. Therein, the national authorities of different countries face incentives to manipulate the terms of trade to increase national welfare in the absence of international policy coordination. Even though the gains of international policy coordination might be small, such gains may become very relevant if balanced against incentives for international noncooperation.

Third, open economies face policy trade-offs if asset market distortions prevent global efficient allocation. Even though the real exchange rate absorbs shocks in current and expected fundamentals, its adjustment does not necessarily result in a desirable allocation and may even exacerbate the misallocation of consumption and employment at both the domestic and global level. This is because, relative to the case of complete markets, both the Phillips curve and the loss function include a welfare-relevant measure of cross-country imbalances. Consequently, this results in domestic goals, e.g. output gaps or inflation, being traded-off against the stabilization of external variables such as the terms of trade or the demand gap. Hence, the optimal monetary policy in this case consists of redressing demand imbalances and/or correcting international relative prices at the cost of some inflation.

Corsetti, Dedola and Leduc (2011) summarize the status quo of research on international monetary policy prescriptions: &quot;Optimal monetary policy thus should target a combination of inward-looking variables such as output gap and inflation, with currency misalignment and cross-country demand misallocation, by leaning against the wind of misaligned exchange rates and international imbalances.&quot; This is main factor in country money status.

===In developing countries===
Developing countries may have problems establishing an effective operating monetary policy. The primary difficulty is that few developing countries have deep markets in government debt. The matter is further complicated by the difficulties in forecasting money demand and fiscal pressure to levy the inflation tax by expanding the base rapidly. In general, the central banks in many developing countries have poor records in managing monetary policy. This is often because the monetary authorities in developing countries are mostly not independent of the government, so good monetary policy takes a backseat to the political desires of the government or is used to pursue other non-monetary goals. For this and other reasons, developing countries that want to establish credible monetary policy may institute a currency board or adopt dollarization. This can avoid interference from the government and may lead to the adoption of monetary policy as carried out in the anchor nation. Recent attempts at liberalizing and reform of financial markets (particularly the recapitalization of banks and other financial institutions in Nigeria and elsewhere) are gradually providing the latitude required to implement monetary policy frameworks by the relevant central banks.

==Trends==

===Transparency===
Beginning with New Zealand in 1990, central banks began adopting formal, public inflation targets with the goal of making the outcomes, if not the process, of monetary policy more transparent. In other words, a central bank may have an inflation target of 2% for a given year, and if inflation turns out to be 5%, then the central bank will typically have to submit an explanation. The Bank of England exemplifies both these trends. It became independent of government through the Bank of England Act 1998 and adopted an inflation target of 2.5% RPI, revised to 2% of CPI in 2003. The success of inflation targeting in the United Kingdom has been attributed to the Bank of England&#x27;s focus on transparency. The Bank of England has been a leader in producing innovative ways of communicating information to the public, especially through its Inflation Report, which have been emulated by many other central banks.

The European Central Bank adopted, in 1998, a definition of price stability within the Eurozone as inflation of under 2% HICP. In 2003, this was revised to inflation below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Since then, the target of 2% has become common for other major central banks, including the Federal Reserve (since January 2012) and Bank of Japan (since January 2013).

=== Green monetary policy ===
Since 2017-2018, a growing number of central banks have started to consider the effects of climate change on their operational frameworks for monetary policy and supervisory policies. In the continuation to a famous speech by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney in September 2015, central bank have justified this work by the fact that climate change will likely generate more volatility in certain markets, some inflationary pressure either due to climate shocks and extreme weather events and linked with an overly slow and disordered transition, and generate climate-related financial risks on the financial sector. As a result, even though central banks are not climate policy makers, from the perspective of their financial stability mandate, they may have to adjust their policies in order to anticipate and mitigate these risks.

This work was spearheaded by the foundation of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) in 2017 by the Bank of England, Banque de France and the Dutch central bank. The NGFS is composed of more than a hundred central banks and financial supervisors.

Proposals for climate-related ajustements to central bank policies range from green macro-prudential rules, green quantitative easing, green collateral frameworks rules and green refinancing operations. In 2021, the European Central Bank has announced that it will &quot;tilt&quot; its corporate bond purchases (effectively implementing a form of Green QE) and look at ways to incorporate climate factors in its collateral framework. The ECB has however refrained so far from implementing a &quot;green interest rate&quot;.

===Effect on business cycles===
There continues to be some debate about whether monetary policy can (or should) smooth business cycles. A central conjecture of Keynesian economics is that the central bank can stimulate aggregate demand in the short run, because a significant number of prices in the economy are fixed in the short run and firms will produce as many goods and services as are demanded (in the long run, however, money is neutral, as in the neoclassical model). However, some economists from the new classical school contend that central banks cannot affect business cycles.

===Behavioral monetary policy===
Conventional macroeconomic models assume that all agents in an economy are fully rational. A rational agent has clear preferences, models uncertainty via expected values of variables or functions of variables, and always chooses to perform the action with the optimal expected outcome for itself among all feasible actions – they maximize their utility. Monetary policy analysis and decisions hence traditionally rely on this New Classical approach.

However, as studied by the field of behavioral economics that takes into account the concept of bounded rationality, people often deviate from the way that these neoclassical theories assume. Humans are generally not able to react in a completely rational manner to the world around them – they do not make decisions in the rational way commonly envisioned in standard macroeconomic models. People have time limitations, cognitive biases, care about issues like fairness and equity and follow rules of thumb (heuristics).

This has implications for the conduct of monetary policy. Monetary policy is the outcome of a complex interaction between monetary institutions, central banker preferences and policy rules, and hence human decision-making plays an important role. It is more and more recognized that the standard rational approach does not provide an optimal foundation for monetary policy actions. These models fail to address important human anomalies and behavioral drivers that explain monetary policy decisions.

An example of a behavioral bias that characterizes the behavior of central bankers is loss aversion: for every monetary policy choice, losses loom larger than gains, and both are evaluated with respect to the status quo. One result of loss aversion is that when gains and losses are symmetric or nearly so, risk aversion may set in. Loss aversion can be found in multiple contexts in monetary policy. The &quot;hard fought&quot; battle against the Great Inflation, for instance, might cause a bias against policies that risk greater inflation.
Another common finding in behavioral studies is that individuals regularly offer estimates of their own ability, competence, or judgments that far exceed an objective assessment: they are overconfident. Central bank policymakers may fall victim to overconfidence in managing the macroeconomy in terms of timing, magnitude, and even the qualitative impact of interventions. Overconfidence can result in actions of the central bank that are either &quot;too little&quot; or &quot;too much&quot;. When policymakers believe their actions will have larger effects than objective analysis would indicate, this results in too little intervention. Overconfidence can, for instance, cause problems when relying on interest rates to gauge the stance of monetary policy: low rates might mean that policy is easy, but they could also signal a weak economy.

These are examples of how behavioral phenomena may have a substantial influence on monetary policy. Monetary policy analyses should thus account for the fact that policymakers (or central bankers) are individuals and prone to biases and temptations that can sensibly influence their ultimate choices in the setting of macroeconomic and/or interest rate targets.

<text>The Rex Popular Front (), Rexist Party, or simply Rex, was a far-right Catholic authoritarian and corporatist political party active in Belgium from 1935 until 1945. The party was founded by a journalist, Léon Degrelle. It advocated Belgian unitarism and royalism. Initially, the party ran in both Flanders and Wallonia, but it never achieved much success outside Wallonia and Brussels. Its name was derived from the Roman Catholic journal and publishing company .

The highest electoral achievement of the Rexist Party was 21 out of 202 deputies (with 11.4% of the vote) and twelve senators in the 1936 election. Never a mass movement, it was on the decline by 1938. During the German occupation of Belgium in World War II, Rex was the most significant collaborationist group in French-speaking Belgium, paralleled by the (VNV) in Flanders. By the war&#x27;s end, Rex was widely discredited and banned following the liberation.

Initially modelled on Italian Fascism and Spanish Falangism, it later drew closer to German Nazism. The Party espoused a &quot;right-wing revolution&quot; and the dominance of the Catholic Church in Belgium, but its ideology came to be vigorously opposed by the leader of the Belgian Church Cardinal van Roey, who called Rexism a &quot;danger to the church and the country&quot;.

==Ideology==
The ideology of Rex, which was loosely based on the writings of Jean Denis, called for the &quot;moral renewal&quot; of Belgian society through the dominance of the Catholic Church by forming a corporatist society and abolishing liberal democracy. Denis became an enthusiastic member of Rex, and later wrote for the party newspaper &quot;Le Pays Réel&quot;. The original programme of Rexism borrowed strongly from Charles Maurras&#x27; integralism. It rejected liberalism, which it deemed decadent, and was strongly opposed to both Marxism and capitalism, instead striving for a corporatist economic model, idealising rural life and traditional family values.

It has been claimed that in its early period until around 1937, Rexism should not be categorised as a ‘fascist movement’, and that it was instead a populist, authoritarian and conservative Catholic nationalist movement that initially tried to win power by democratic means, and did not want to totally abolish democratic institutions. The party increasingly made use of fascist-style rhetoric, but only after Degrelle&#x27;s defeat in a by-election in April 1937 did it openly embrace anti-Semitism and anti-parliamentarianism, following the model of German Nazism. Historian Roger Griffin in “The Nature of Fascism” states that the Rexist Party during the German occupation of Belgium as &quot;fully fascist&quot;; until then, he considers it &quot;proto-fascist&quot;.

The Rexist movement attracted support almost exclusively from Wallonia. On 6 October 1936, party leader Léon Degrelle made a secret agreement with Rex&#x27;s Flemish counterpart, the (VNV) (led by Staf De Clercq. Both movements strove for a corporatist system. Still, unlike the Rexists, the VNV sought to separate Flanders from Belgium and to unite it with the Netherlands. The Flemish side cancelled the agreement after just one year. It also faced competition from the ideologically similar (but explicitly anti-German) (&quot;National Legion&quot;) of Paul Hoornaert.

==Pre-war politics==
The Rexist Party was founded in 1935 after its leader Léon Degrelle had left the mainstream Catholic Party, which he deemed too moderate. It targeted disappointed constituencies such as traditionalist Catholics, veterans, small traders and jobless people. In the Depression era, it initially won considerable popularity — mostly due to its leader&#x27;s charisma and energy. Its most tremendous success was winning 11.5 per cent of the total vote in the 1936 election. On that occasion the Rexist Party took 21 of the 202 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 8 out of 101 in the Senate, making it the fourth-strongest force in Parliament, behind the significant established parties (Labour, Catholic, Liberal).

However, the support for the party (even at its height) was extremely localized: Rexists succeeded in garnering over 30 per cent of the vote in the French-speaking province of Luxembourg, compared with just 9 per cent in equally French-speaking Hainaut. Degrelle admired Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power and progressively imitated the tone and style of fascist campaigning, while the movement&#x27;s ties to the Roman Catholic Church were increasingly repudiated by the Belgian clergy.

Degrelle ran in the April 1937 Brussels by-election against Prime Minister Paul van Zeeland of the Catholic Party, who was supported — in the hope of thwarting a Rexist victory — by all other parties, including even the Communists. The Archbishop of Mechelen and primate of the Catholic Church of Belgium, Jozef-Ernest Cardinal van Roey, intervened, rebuking Rexist voters, insisting that even abstention from voting would be sinful, and calling Rexism &quot;a danger to the country and to the Church&quot;. Degrelle was decisively defeated: he obtained only 20 per cent of the vote, the rest going to Van Zeeland.

Afterwards, Rexism allied itself with the interests of Nazi Germany even more strongly and incorporated Nazi-style antisemitism into its platform. At the same time, its popularity declined sharply. In the 1939 national election, Rex&#x27;s share of votes fell to 4.4 per cent, and the party lost 17 of its 21 seats, largely to the mainstream Catholic and Liberal parties.

==Second World War==

With the German invasion of Belgium in 1940, Rexism welcomed German occupation, even though it had initially supported the pre-war Belgian policy of neutrality. While some former Rexists went into the underground resistance or (like José Streel) withdrew from politics after they had come to see the Nazis&#x27; anticlerical and extreme anti-Semitic policies enforced in occupied Belgium, most Rexists, however, proudly supported the occupiers and assisted German forces with the repression of the territory wherever they could. Nevertheless, the popularity of Rex continued to drop. In 1941, at a reunion in Liège, Degrelle was booed by about a hundred demonstrators.

In August 1944, a Rexist militia was responsible for the Courcelles Massacre.

===Collaboration===
Closely affiliated with Rex was the Walloon Legion, a unit within the German Army and later the raised from French-speaking volunteers in Belgium with Rexist support after German invasion of the Soviet Union. After an initial failure to attract recruits, Degrelle volunteered for the unit as a publicity stunt and spent much of the rest of the war outside Belgium on the Eastern Front. He increasingly saw the Walloon Legion as a better vehicle for seeking German support than the Rexist Party, and recruitment drained the party of its cadres. Whilst Degrelle was absent, nominal leadership of the party passed to Victor Matthys.


The Rexists had their paramilitary wing known as the (Combat Formations), founded in 1940 and having around 4,000 members. Their members wore dark blue uniforms with the red Burgundian cross. Due to the constant depletion of its strength through members volunteering for more active forms of service in the German forces, the had, by the end of 1943, virtually ceased to function.

==End of Rexism==
The party had been banned from the liberation of Belgium in September 1944. With the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945, many former Rexists were imprisoned or executed for their role during collaboration. Victor Matthys and José Streel were both executed by firing squad, Jean Denis (who had played only a minor role during the war) was imprisoned.

Degrelle took refuge in Francoist Spain. He was convicted of treason in Belgium and sentenced to death, but repeated requests to extradite him were turned down by the Spanish government. Stripped of his citizenship and excommunicated (later lifted in Germany), Degrelle died in Málaga in 1994.

<text>A carboy, also known as a demijohn or a lady jeanne, is a rigid container with a typical capacity of . Carboys are primarily used for transporting liquids, often drinking water or chemicals.

They are also used for in-home fermentation of beverages, often beer or wine.

== History and etymology ==

The word &quot;&quot; is from the Persian &quot;qarābah&quot; (), from Middle Persian &quot;Karāvah&quot;. Arabic also borrowed it as &quot;qarrāba&quot;, meaning &quot;big jug&quot;. The Spanish-language term is &quot;garrafa&quot;. English &quot;carafe&quot; is an etymological doublet via Italian and French.

&quot;&quot; originally referred to any glass vessel with a large body and small neck, enclosed in wickerwork. The word presumably comes from the French &quot;dame-jeanne&quot;, literally &quot;Lady Jane&quot;, as a popular appellation; this word is first attested in France in the 17th century. In Italian it is called &quot;damigiana&quot;, most probably derived from French. In some Spanish-speaking countries such as Argentina, it is also referred to as &quot;damajuana&quot;. An alternative etymology derives it from the name of a Persian town, Damghan, but there is no evidence for this.

==Size==
Carboys come in various volumes ranging from . The term carboy itself usually refers to a carboy, unless otherwise noted. A carboy is sometimes called a jug. A carboy is usually called a demijohn (in the Philippines, &quot;dama juana&quot;).

In Britain, &quot;demijohn&quot; refers to a glass brewing vessel.

==Brewing==
In brewing, a carboy or demijohn is a glass or plastic vessel used in fermenting beverages such as wine, mead, cider, perry, and beer. Usually it is fitted with a rubber stopper and a fermentation lock to prevent bacteria and oxygen from entering during the fermentation process.

During the homebrewing process, a primary carboy is used for fermentation. Once primary fermentation is complete, the beer is either transferred to a secondary carboy for conditioning or it can be transferred directly to bottles for conditioning. (This process of transferring is usually called racking.)

==Laboratory==
In modern laboratories, carboys are usually made of plastic, though traditionally were (and still are in many university settings) made of ferric glass or other shatter-resistant glasses immune to acid corrosion or halide staining common in older plastic formulations. They are used for storing large quantities of liquids, such as solvents or deionised water. In these applications, a tap may be included for dispensing. Carboys are also used to collect and store waste solvents. Collecting waste solvents in plastic carboys is preferable to reusing glass Winchesters due to the lesser chance of breakage if a solution is placed in an incorrectly labeled carboy. Polypropylene carboys are also commonly used in laboratories to transfer purified water. They are typically filled at the top and have a spigot at the bottom for dispensing.

<text>In chemistry, deposition occurs when molecules settle out of a solution. Deposition can be defined as the process of direct transition of a substance from its gaseous form, on cooling, into a solid state without passing through the intermediate liquid state.

Deposition can be viewed as a reverse process to dissolution or particle re-entrainment.

<doc id="297040" wikidata="Q188714" url="?curid=297040" title="Nave">
<text>The nave () is the central part of a church, stretching from the (normally western) main entrance or rear wall, to the transepts, or in a church without transepts, to the chancel. When a church contains side aisles, as in a basilica-type building, the strict definition of the term &quot;nave&quot; is restricted to the central aisle. In a broader, more colloquial sense, the nave includes all areas available for the lay worshippers, including the side-aisles and transepts. Either way, the nave is distinct from the area reserved for the choir and clergy.

==Description==
The nave extends from the entry—which may have a separate vestibule (the narthex)—to the chancel and may be flanked by lower side-aisles separated from the nave by an arcade. If the aisles are high and of a width comparable to the central nave, the structure is sometimes said to have three naves. It provides the central approach to the high altar.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;nave&quot; is from , the Latin word for &quot;ship&quot;, an early Christian symbol of the Church as a whole, with a possible connection to the &quot;Ship of St. Peter&quot; or the Ark of Noah. The term may also have been suggested by the keel shape of the vaulting of a church. In many Nordic and Baltic countries a model ship is commonly found hanging in the nave of a church, and in some languages the same word means both &#x27;nave&#x27; and &#x27;ship&#x27;, as for instance Danish , Swedish , Dutch or Spanish .

==History==
The earliest churches were built when builders were familiar with the form of the Roman basilica, a public building for business transactions. It had a wide central area, with aisles separated by columns, and with windows near the ceiling. Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome is an early church which had this form. It was built in the 4th century on the orders of Roman emperor Constantine I, and replaced in the 16th century.

The nave, the main body of the building, is the section set apart for the laity, while the chancel is reserved for the clergy. In medieval churches the nave was separated from the chancel by the rood screen; these, being elaborately decorated, were notable features in European churches from the 14th to the mid-16th century.

Medieval naves were divided into bays, the repetition of form giving an effect of great length; and the vertical element of the nave was emphasized. During the Renaissance, in place of dramatic effects there were more balanced proportions.

By the 1300s, the maintenance and decoration of the nave of parish churches was the responsibility of the parishioners; the clergy were responsible for keeping the chancel in repair.

==Record-holders==

<doc id="297057" wikidata="Q251842" url="?curid=297057" title="Helmeted guineafowl">
<text>The helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris) is the best known of the guineafowl bird family, Numididae, and the only member of the genus Numida. It is native to Africa, mainly south of the Sahara, and has been widely introduced, as a domesticated species, into the West Indies, North America, Colombia, Brazil, Australia and Europe.

==Taxonomy==

The helmeted guineafowl was formally described by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Phasianus meleagris&quot;. In 1764, Linnaeus moved the helmeted guineafowl to the new genus &quot;Numida&quot;. The genus name &quot;Numida&quot; is Latin for &quot;North African&quot;.

In the early days of the European colonisation of North America, the native wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;) was confused with this species. The word &quot;meleagris&quot;, Greek for guineafowl, is also shared in the scientific names of the two species, though for the guineafowl it is the species name, whereas for the turkey, it is the name of the genus and, in inflected form, the former family, Meleagridididae.

===Subspecies===
The nine recognised subspecies are:
* &quot;N. m. coronata&quot; – Gurney&#x27;s helmeted guineafowl – The type locality is restricted to Uitenhage; it occurs in eastern and central South Africa and western Eswatini.
* &quot;N. m. galeatus&quot; – West African guineafowl – western Africa to southern Chad, central Zaire, and northern Angola
* &quot;N. m. marungensis&quot; – Marungu helmeted guineafowl – south Congo Basin to western Angola and Zambia
* &quot;N. m. meleagris &quot; – Saharan helmeted guineafowl – eastern Chad to Ethiopia, northern Zaire, Uganda and northern Kenya
* &quot;N. m. mitrata&quot; – tufted guineafowl – Terra Typica &quot;Madagascar&quot; (introduced or erroneous). Occurs in Tanzania to Zambia, Botswana, northern South Africa, eastern Eswatini and Mozambique.
* &quot;N. m. damarensis&quot; – Damara helmeted guineafowl – Terra Typica: Windhoek. Occurs from arid southern Angola to northern Namibia and Botswana north of 26°S
* &quot;N. m. reichenowi&quot; – Reichenow&#x27;s helmeted guineafowl – Kenya and central Tanzania
* &quot;N. m. sabyi&quot; – Saby&#x27;s helmeted guineafowl – northwestern Morocco
* &quot;N. m. somaliensis&quot; – Somali tufted guineafowl – northeastern Ethiopia and Somalia

==Description==

The helmeted guineafowl is a large, bird with a round body and small head. They weigh about . The body plumage is gray-black speckled with white. Like other guineafowl, this species has an unfeathered head, which in this species is decorated with a dull yellow or reddish bony knob, and bare skin with red, blue, or black hues. The wings are short and rounded, and the tail is likewise short. Various subspecies are proposed, differences in appearance being mostly a large variation in shape, size, and colour of the casque and facial wattles.

==Behaviour and ecology==
This is a gregarious species, forming flocks outside the breeding season typically of about 25 birds that also roost communally. Guineafowl are particularly well-suited to consuming massive quantities of ticks, which might otherwise spread Lyme disease. These birds are terrestrial, and prone to run rather than fly when alarmed. Like most gallinaceous birds, they have a short-lived, explosive flight and rely on gliding to cover extended distances. Helmeted guineafowl can walk 10 km and more in a day. Their bodies are well-suited for running and they are remarkably successful in maintaining dynamic stability over rough terrain at speed. They make loud harsh calls when disturbed.

Their diet consists of a variety of animal and plant foods. During the nonbreeding season, &quot;N. meleagris&quot; consumes corns, tubers, and seeds, particularly of agricultural weeds, as well as various agricultural crop spillage. During the breeding season, more than 80% of their diet may be invertebrates, particularly arthropods such as beetles. Guineafowl are equipped with strong claws and scratch in loose soil for food much like domestic chickens, although they seldom uproot growing plants in so doing. As with all of the Numididae, they have no spurs. They may live for up to 12 years in the wild.

Males often show aggression towards each other, and partake in aggressive fighting, which may leave other males bloodied and otherwise injured. They attempt to make themselves look more fearsome by raising their wings upwards from their sides and bristling their feathers across the length of their bodies, and they may also rush towards their opponent with a gaping beak. The nest is a well-hidden, generally unlined scrape, and a clutch is normally some 6 to 12 eggs, which the female incubates for 26 to 28 days. Nests containing larger numbers of eggs are generally believed to be the result of more than one hen using the nest; eggs are large, and an incubating bird could not realistically cover significantly more than a normal clutch.

Domesticated birds, at least, are notable for producing very thick-shelled eggs that are reduced to fragments as the young birds (known as keets among bird breeders) hatch, rather than leaving two large sections and small chips where the keet has removed the end of the egg. Domesticated guinea hens are not the best of mothers, and often abandon their nests. The keets are cryptically coloured, and rapid wing growth enables them to flutter onto low branches barely a week after hatching.

==Reproduction==
Helmeted guinea fowl are seasonal breeders. Summer is the peak breeding season in which the testes could weigh up to 1.6 gm, while during winter no breeding activity takes place. The serum testosterone level is up to 5.37 ng/ ml during the breeding season.

==Habitat==

They breed in warm, fairly dry and open habitats with scattered shrubs and trees such as savanna or farmland.

==Domestication==
Helmeted guineafowl are often domesticated, and it is this species that is sold in Western supermarkets. Feral populations descended from domestic flocks are now widely distributed and occur in the West Indies, North America, Australia and Europe.

<doc id="297058" wikidata="Q1007996" url="?curid=297058" title="Aisle">
<text>An aisle is a linear space for walking with rows of non-walking spaces on both sides. Aisles with seating on both sides can be seen in airplanes, in buildings such as churches, cathedrals, synagogues, meeting halls, parliaments, courtrooms, theatres, and in long passenger vehicles. An aisle floor may be level or, as in theatres, sloping upward from a stage.

Aisles also cross through shops, where they have shelving on either side; warehouses, flanked by storage pallets; and factories, where they separate different work areas. In health clubs, exercise equipment is normally arranged along aisles.

They are distinguished from corridors, hallways, walkways, footpaths, pavements (&quot;American English&quot; sidewalks), trails, paths and open areas of buildings: aisles lie between other open or seating areas, which are all enclosed within a structure. Spaces between buildings are not considered aisles, regardless of their size.

The word is related to French &quot;aile&quot; (wing).
==Typical physical characteristics==

Aisles have certain general physical characteristics:
*They are almost always straight, not curved.
*They are usually fairly long. An open space with three rows of chairs beside it would not usually be considered an aisle.

===Width of various types of aisles===
*Theatres, meeting halls, shops, etc., usually have aisles wide enough for 2–3 strangers to walk past each other without feeling uncomfortably close. In such facilities, a space that could comfortably accommodate more than four people side-by-side would generally be considered an &quot;open area&quot;, rather than an &quot;aisle&quot;.
*Factory work area aisles are usually wide enough for workers to comfortably sit or stand while working, while allowing safe and efficient movement of persons, equipment and/or materials.
*Passage aisles are usually just wide enough for a large person to carry a suitcase in each hand, but not for two people to pass side-by-side without touching. Usually, even without luggage one person must turn sideways for the other to pass.
*Warehouse aisles normally are at least 8–10 feet (2.4–3 meters) wide to fit mechanical loading equipment.
*Wedding aisles are at least wide enough for two people to walk comfortably beside each other.
*Vehicle aisles are wide enough for a designated type of vehicle to pass, either one way or two way. 

==Architecture==
In architecture, an aisle is more specifically the wing of a house, or a lateral division of a large building. The earliest examples of aisles date back to the Roman times and can be found in the Basilica Ulpia (basilica of Trajan), which had double aisles on either side of its central area. The church of St. Peter&#x27;s in Rome has the same number.

==Church architecture==

In church architecture, an aisle (also known as an &quot;yle&quot; or &quot;alley&quot;) is more specifically a passageway to either side of the nave that is separated from the nave by colonnades or arcades, a row of pillars or columns. Occasionally aisles stop at the transepts, but often aisles can be continued around the apse. Aisles are thus categorized as &quot;nave-aisles&quot;, &quot;transept-aisles&quot; or &quot;choir-aisles&quot;. A semi-circular choir with aisles continued around it, providing access to a series of chapels, is a chevet.

In Gothic architecture, the aisles&#x27; roofs are lower than that of the nave, allowing light to enter through clerestory windows. In Romanesque architecture, however, the roofs are at roughly equal heights, with those of the aisle being only slightly lower than that of the nave. In Germany, churches where the roofs of the aisles and nave are the same height, such as St. Stephen&#x27;s, Vienna, the Wiesenkirche at Soest, St. Martin&#x27;s, Landshut, and the Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady) in Munich are known as &quot;Hallenkirchen&quot;.

When discussing overall design, architectural historians include the centrally-positioned nave in the number of aisles. Thus the original St Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome, Milan Cathedral, Amiens Cathedral, Notre Dame de Paris and Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia are all described as having five aisles, meaning they have two side aisles either side of the nave. Antwerp Cathedral even has seven aisles (three at either side of the central nave). In the United Kingdom, cathedrals generally only have one aisle on each side, with Chichester Cathedral, Elgin Cathedral and St Mary Magdalene, Taunton being the only three exceptions.
==Supermarkets and retail stores==

In supermarkets there are two types of aisles, food aisles and checkout aisles.

Food aisles are where goods are displayed. At the end of food aisles may be found crown end displays, where high-margin goods are displayed for impulse purchase.

In retail stores that do not primarily sell food, aisles containing products would be referred to either generically as merchandise aisles, or by the particular products contained in the aisle, e.g., &quot;the gardening aisle&quot;, &quot;the sports equipment aisle&quot;.

Checkout aisles contain cash registers at which customers make their purchases. Regardless of the type of merchandise the establishment sells, it is common to display a range of &quot;impulse buy&quot; items along the checkout aisle, such as cold beverages, magazines, candy and batteries. These are often called &quot;lanes&quot; to distinguish them from the food aisles.

===Signage===
For customer convenience, supermarkets and retail stores commonly number the aisles and have signs indicating both the aisle number and the types of products displayed in that aisle.

Churches, courtrooms, legislatures, and meeting halls may identify individual rows, seats or sections but do not normally assign aisle numbers or display signs regarding aisles.

==Libraries==

Libraries are commonly divided into several areas:
*Circulation desk
*Collections, areas where materials are grouped, e.g., Children&#x27;s Collection. This may include book shelves, manuscripts, photos, etc.
*The &quot;stacks&quot;, where books are shelved
*The Reference Room where materials with limited circulation are stored
*Public reading areas containing seats and desks

The spaces between rows of book shelves in the &quot;stacks&quot; area are called aisles and desks in the reading area are frequently arranged in rows with aisles.

== Computer server rooms==

Server rooms are typically divided into hot and cold aisles for cooling efficiency, and access to servers.
==Performance venues==


===Cinemas, indoor theatres and concert halls===

Films, stage plays and musical concerts ordinarily are presented in a darkened facility so the audience can see the presentation better. To improve safety, often the edges of the aisles in such facilities are marked with a row of small lights. The markers frequently are strings of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) because LEDs are durable, have low power consumption and use low voltages that are not subject to electrical codes. To provide a higher level of light focused downward, lighting fixtures referred to as luminaries are often built into the side of the seat facing the aisle.

===Stadiums and outdoor arenas===
Sport stadiums and outdoor arenas frequently have several types of aisles, including aisles to purchase tickets for events, aisles to enter the main event area and aisles to go to seating. Stadium seating routinely is separated into sections by aisles. Seating rows are accessed by stairsteps. To promote safety, aisles commonly are divided by a handrail in the middle of the aisle.

==Stables and barns==

The floor plan of aisled barns resembles that of an aisled church. However, the nave in farm buildings is called an aisle thus a &quot;three aisled barn&quot;. Aisled barns have the big barn doors on the gable end of the building giving access to the center aisle, often called the drive floor or threshing floor. The side aisles may be the same widths making the barn symmetrical or the aisle where animals were housed may be narrower which is apparent outside the barn because the barn doors are then off-center. The area between the posts, perpendicular to the aisles are called bays. In stables there is a stable aisle down the centre with individual stalls facing the aisle.

==Vehicles==
On vehicles, the aisle is more specifically a passageway for passengers to move along within the vehicle.
==Safety and regulatory considerations==
National and local government regulations require a minimum width for aisles in various building types. Regulatory agencies frequently inspect buildings, vehicles, etc., to enforce regulations requiring that aisles not be restricted. Inspectors have imposed fines for blocking or restricting passage when boxes or folding chairs are stored in aisles, for example. Insurance companies frequently have safety inspectors to examine the premises, both to determine whether insureds are complying with the insurer&#x27;s requirements for coverage and to look for any practices that could lead to injury or property damage, including restricting passage in aisles.

The Americans with Disabilities Act sets certain standards for building access and other design considerations in all new construction and major renovations in the U.S. An architectural barrier is any feature that makes access or use of a building difficult, unreasonably dangerous or impossible. This can include aisles that are too narrow for easy access by a wheelchair. Often, the only way to get from a row of chairs, shelves, workstations, etc., to an exit is by an aisle. Historically, many deaths and serious injuries have occurred due to fire, inhalation of smoke or noxious fumes, etc., because blocked or partially blocked aisles prevented persons from promptly leaving a dangerous area.

Regulations applicable to public carriers transporting passengers often require aisles to be completely clear in vehicles, such as airlines, buses and trains. Many insurance companies have requirements regarding minimum aisle width, unrestricted aisles and easy access to exits, and will refuse to insure companies that do not meet their requirements or will increase the premiums on companies that frequently violate the requirements.

<doc id="297062" wikidata="Q16157097" url="?curid=297062" title="Aisles">
<text>Aisles is a six-piece Chilean progressive rock band originally from Santiago, Chile.

The band combines elements of rock, progressive rock, fusion, and Latin music, among others. Aisles has toured in South America, North America and Europe, participating in several Prog-rock festivals. The band&#x27;s albums have been released in Europe, the United States, Japan. In 2009, the band was nominated for &quot;Best Foreign Record&quot; by the &quot;Prog Awards&quot; for their second album, &quot;In Sudden Walks&quot;.

Aisles&#x27; third album, &quot;4:45 AM,&quot; was released October 29, 2013, on Presagio Records. The band released their fourth record, Hawaii, on July 29, 2016.

== History ==

===Formation, &quot;The Yearning&quot; (2001–2005)===
Aisles was established in 2001 by Germán Vergara (guitar, vocals), his brother Luis (keyboards), and their childhood friend Rodrigo Sepúlveda (guitar, vocals). In 2002, they expanded their lineup with Brazilian musician Alejandro Meléndez. Initially, the band sought a lead vocalist, prompting them to invite Sebastián, the younger brother of Germán and Luis, for auditions. His exceptional vocal talent led to his appointment as the permanent frontman, thus solidifying the band&#x27;s original lineup. Following a series of performances in local clubs and bars, Aisles entered the studio in 2003 to record what was intended to be a professional demo. However, the band was so pleased with the resulting sound quality and musical execution that they opted to release it as their debut full-length album. Titled &quot;The Yearning&quot; (2005), the album underwent a meticulous mixing and mastering process over ten weeks. It was subsequently distributed across South America, Europe, the United States, and Japan, garnering favorable reviews from specialized media. Notably, Françoise Couture of Allmusic described &quot;The Yearning&quot; as &quot;a convincing disc of South American-flavored neo-progressive rock,&quot; noting that while it doesn&#x27;t reinvent the genre, the musicians clearly demonstrate a strong command of their craft. In a detailed review, Conor Fines from Prog Sphere emphasized the noteworthy qualities of Aisles&#x27; debut album, &quot;The Yearning&quot;. He remarked that the album stands out on its own merits, showcasing captivating melodies and robust songwriting that collectively create a compelling listening experience. Fines praised the impressive performances throughout, highlighting how each element intertwines with a wealth of intricate details in the music. This richness invites listeners to revisit the album multiple times, ultimately marking it as an unexpected triumph in the realm of progressive rock.

===Touring, &quot;In Sudden Walks&quot; (2006–2011)===
After the release of its debut album, the band spent most of 2006 touring in the local circuit, playing in venues such as House of Rock, Subterráneo, and several theaters across the country. In 2006, Felipe González joined the band to play bass during live performances, and in late 2007, Felipe Candia joined the band on drums to start rehearsals for Aisles&#x27; second album.

The works for the band&#x27;s second album extended for over a year. This time, the group took a darker, more visual approach, mixing elements of music and drama, as shown in the opening track, &quot;Mariachi.&quot; The broadening sound, including genres such as Latin music, and the high sound quality and production made many consider the album a leap forward. In Sudden Walks was self-produced and released in January 2009. Once again, the album was well-received by fans and critics. Cesar Inca of Prog Archives said, &quot;In Sudden Walks may have been one of the five most accomplished neo-prog albums of 2009. It is a lovely collection of inventive compositions and bold arrangements&quot;, while David Dashifen Kees of USA Progressive Music stated &quot;From moment one, the album reveals a unique composition of sounds which display an understanding of music and a depth of theme and creativity that many other bands lack.&quot;

In August 2009, Aisles was the only South American band invited to participate in the Crescendo Prog Rock festival in Saint-Palais Sur Mer, France, and was later nominated for the Prog Awards in the Best Foreign Record category in Italy. After touring Europe, the band spent the rest of 2010 playing in its home country, in venues such as Sala SCD, Sala Master, Teatro Nemesio Antúnez, and Café del Teatro. In late 2010, keyboardist Luis Vergara left the band due to musical differences.

===&quot;4:45 AM&quot; (2011–2014)===
In the second half of 2011, Daniel Baird-Kerr joined the band as a full-time bassist to start rehearsals for the band&#x27;s upcoming album. With a new line up, and a strong desire to internationalize their career, Aisles started working on their third album.

&quot;4:45 AM&quot; was recorded in several studios in Santiago between July 2012 and August 2013, with production duties taken by guitarist Germán Vergara. The album had a greater emphasis on visual aesthetics, taking elements from drama and other art forms. &quot;4:45 AM&quot; was released in October 2013 through Presagio Records. The album was critically acclaimed; Brian McKinnon of Prog Rock Music Talk said: &quot;4:45 AM is nothing short of a masterwork of art. It is the reason people fall in love with music in the first place. An astounding piece of work for the ages&quot;. Breakout, one of Germany&#x27;s most long-established rock magazines, chose &quot;4:45 AM&quot; as one of the best albums of the month. The album was released at a show on 22 October 2014, at Teatro Ladrón de Bicicletas, in Santiago de Chile. A couple of months before this shows, keyboardist Alejandro Meléndez left, and was replaced by his friend Juan Pablo Gaete.

===&quot;Hawaii&quot; (2015–2022)===
In July 2015, the band started writing songs for their upcoming new album at a beach house, where they stayed for a week. The recording sessions took place in November 2015, for ten days, at the prestigious Estudio del Sur, in Maria Pinto, 54 km west of the Chilean capital.

&quot;Hawaii&quot; is a two-disc concept album about human colonies established in space after the destruction of the Earth. Its twelve tracks explore the dilemmas and challenges that the individual and the human spirit would face in this futuristic scenario. The album was praised by the critics; it was chosen by Chilean premiere rock magazine as album of the year.

The band toured Europe for the first time in their career in October 2016, following a release show at Cine Arte Alameda in Santiago. Aisles played in the Netherlands, France, Belgium and England.

In September 2020 the band introduced their new singer, Israel Gil, and are currently working on their fifth studio album, to be released in 2021.

<text>A transistor radio is a small portable radio receiver that uses transistor-based circuitry. Previous portable radios used vacuum tubes, which were bulky, fragile, had a limited lifetime, consumed excessive power and required large heavy batteries. Following the invention of the transistor in 1947—which revolutionized the field of consumer electronics by introducing small but powerful, convenient hand-held devices—the Regency TR-1 was released in 1954 becoming the first commercial transistor radio. The mass-market success of the smaller and cheaper Sony TR-63, released in 1957, led to the transistor radio becoming the most popular electronic communication device of the 1960s and 1970s. Transistor radios are still commonly used as car radios. Billions of transistor radios are estimated to have been sold worldwide between the 1950s and 2012.

The pocket size of transistor radios sparked a change in popular music listening habits, allowing people to listen to music anywhere they went. Beginning around 1980, however, cheap AM transistor radios were superseded initially by the boombox and the Sony Walkman, and later on by digitally-based devices with higher audio quality such as portable CD players, personal audio players, MP3 players and (eventually) by smartphones, many of which contain FM radios. A transistor is a semiconductor device that amplifies and acts as an electronic switch.

==Background==

Before the transistor was invented, radios used vacuum tubes. Although portable vacuum tube radios were produced, they were typically bulky and heavy. The need for a low voltage high current source to power the filaments of the tubes and high voltage for the anode potential typically required two batteries. Vacuum tubes were also inefficient and fragile compared to transistors and had a limited lifetime.

Bell Laboratories demonstrated the first transistor on December 23, 1947. The scientific team at Bell Laboratories responsible for the solid-state amplifier included William Shockley, Walter Houser Brattain, and John Bardeen After obtaining patent protection, the company held a news conference on June 30, 1948, at which a prototype transistor radio was demonstrated.

There are many claimants to the title of the first company to produce practical transistor radios, often incorrectly attributed to Sony (originally Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation). Texas Instruments had demonstrated all-transistor AM (amplitude modulation) radios as early as May 25, 1954, but their performance was well below that of equivalent vacuum tube models. A workable all-transistor radio was demonstrated in August 1953 at the Düsseldorf Radio Fair by the German firm Intermetall. It was built with four of Intermetall&#x27;s hand-made transistors, based upon the 1948 invention of the &quot;Transistor&quot;-germanium point-contact transistor by Herbert Mataré and Heinrich Welker. However, as with the early Texas Instruments units (and others) only prototypes were ever built; it was never put into commercial production. RCA had demonstrated a prototype transistor radio as early as 1952, and it is likely that they and the other radio makers were planning transistor radios of their own, but Texas Instruments and Regency Division of I.D.E.A., were the first to offer a production model starting in October 1954.
The use of transistors instead of vacuum tubes as the amplifier elements meant that the device was much smaller, required far less power to operate than a tube radio, and was more resistant to physical shock. Since the transistor&#x27;s base element draws current, its input impedance is low in contrast to the high input impedance of the vacuum tubes. It also allowed &quot;instant-on&quot; operation, since there were no filaments to heat up. The typical portable tube radio of the fifties was about the size and weight of a lunchbox and contained several heavy, non-rechargeable batteries—one or more so-called &quot;A&quot; batteries to heat the tube filaments and a large 45- to 90-volt &quot;B&quot; battery to power the signal circuits. By comparison, the transistor radio could fit in a pocket and weighed half a pound or less, and was powered by standard flashlight batteries or a single compact battery. The 9-volt battery was introduced for powering transistor radios.

== Early commercial transistor radios ==
=== Regency TR-1 ===

Two companies working together, Texas Instruments of Dallas, and Industrial Development Engineering Associates (I.D.E.A.) of Indianapolis, Indiana, were behind the unveiling of the Regency TR-1, the world&#x27;s first commercially produced transistor radio. Previously, Texas Instruments was producing instrumentation for the oil industry and locating devices for the U.S. Navy and I.D.E.A. built home television antenna boosters. The two companies worked together on the TR-1, looking to grow revenues for their respective companies by breaking into this new product area. In May 1954, Texas Instruments had designed and built a prototype and was looking for an established radio manufacturer to develop and market a radio using their transistors. The Chief Project Engineer for the radio design at Texas Instruments&#x27; headquarters in Dallas, Texas was Paul D. Davis Jr., who had a degree in Electrical Engineering from Southern Methodist University. He was assigned the project due to his experience with radio engineering in World War II. None of the major radio makers including RCA, GE, Philco, and Emerson were interested. The President of I.D.E.A. at the time, Ed Tudor, jumped at the opportunity to manufacture the TR-1, predicting sales of the transistor radios at &quot;20 million radios in three years&quot;. The Regency TR-1 was announced on October 18, 1954, by the Regency Division of I.D.E.A., was put on sale in November 1954 and was the first practical transistor radio made in any significant numbers. &quot;Billboard&quot; reported in 1954 that &quot;the radio has only four transistors. One acts as a combination mixer-oscillator, one as an audio amplifier, and two as intermediate-frequency amplifiers.&quot; One year after the release of the TR-1 sales approached the 100,000 mark. The look and size of the TR-1 were well received, but with only four transistors the sound quality was poor, and the reviews of the TR-1&#x27;s performance were typically adverse. The Regency TR-1 was patented by Richard C. Koch, former Project Engineer of I.D.E.A.

=== Raytheon 8-TP-1 ===
In February 1955, the second transistor radio, the 8-TP-1, was introduced by Raytheon. It was larger than the TR-1, including a four-inch speaker and eight transistors, four more than the TR-1, so the sound quality was much better. An additional benefit of the 8-TP-1 was its efficient battery consumption; the 8-TP-1 cost 1/6 cent per hour to operate, while the TR-1 cost 40 times as much. While the Raytheon radio cost $30 more than the RCA 6-BX-63 tube radio, the latter used $38 of batteries over the same time that the 8-TP-1 used 60 cents. In July 1955 the first positive review of a transistor radio appeared in the &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;. Noting the 8-TP-1&#x27;s high sound quality and very low battery cost, the magazine stated that &quot;The transistors in this set have not been used in an effort to build the smallest radio on the market, and good performance has not been sacrificed&quot;.

Following the success of the 8-TP-1, Zenith, RCA, DeWald, Westinghouse, and Crosley produced many additional transistor radio models. The TR-1 remained the only shirt pocket-sized radio; rivals made &quot;coat-pocket radios&quot; that &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; also reviewed as not performing well.
=== Chrysler Mopar 914HR ===

Chrysler and Philco announced that they had developed and produced the world&#x27;s first all-transistor car radio in the April 28th 1955 edition of the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;. Chrysler made the all-transistor car radio, Mopar model 914HR, available as an &quot;option&quot; in fall 1955 for its new line of 1956 Chrysler and Imperial cars, which hit the showroom floor on October 21, 1955. The all-transistor car radio was a $150 option ().

==Japanese transistor radios==

While on a trip to the United States in 1952, Masaru Ibuka, founder of Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation (now Sony), discovered that AT&amp;T was about to make licensing available for the transistor. Ibuka and his partner, physicist Akio Morita, convinced the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to finance the $25,000 licensing fee (equivalent to $ today). For several months Ibuka traveled around the United States borrowing ideas from the American transistor manufacturers. Improving upon the ideas, Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation made its first functional transistor radio in 1954. Within five years, Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation grew from seven employees to approximately five hundred.

Other Japanese companies soon followed their entry into the American market and the grand total of electronic products exported from Japan in 1958 increased 2.5 times in comparison to 1957.

===Sony TR-55===
In August 1955, while still a small company, Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation introduced their TR-55 five-transistor radio under the new brand name Sony. With this radio, Sony became the first company to manufacture the transistors and other components they used to construct the radio. The TR-55 was also the first transistor radio to utilize all miniature components. It&#x27;s estimated that only 5,000 to 10,000 units were produced.
===Sony TR-63===
The TR-63 was introduced by Sony to the United States in December 1957. The TR-63 was narrower and shorter than the original Regency TR-1. Like the TR-1 it was offered in four colors: lemon, green, red, and black. In addition to its smaller size, the TR-63 had a small tuning capacitor and required a new battery design to produce the proper voltage. It used the nine-volt battery, which would become the standard for transistor radios. Approximately 100,000 units of the TR-63 were imported in 1957. This &quot;pocketable&quot; (the term &quot;pocketable&quot; was a matter of some interpretation, as Sony allegedly had special shirts made with oversized pockets for their salesmen) model proved highly successful. This should be treated with caution. A restored Sony TR63 readily fits a common shirt pocket.

The TR-63 was the first transistor radio to sell in the millions, leading to the mass-market penetration of transistor radios. The TR-63 went on to sell seven million units worldwide by the mid-1960s. With the visible success of the TR-63, Japanese competitors such as Toshiba and Sharp Corporation joined the market. By 1959, in the United States market, there were more than six million transistor radio sets produced by Japanese companies that represented $62 million in revenue.

The success of transistor radios led to transistors replacing vacuum tubes as the dominant electronic technology in the late 1950s. The transistor radio went on to become the most popular electronic communication device of the 1960s and 1970s. Billions of transistor radios are estimated to have been sold worldwide between the 1950s and 2012.

== Pricing ==
Prior to the Regency TR-1, transistors were difficult to produce. Only one in five transistors that were produced worked as expected (only a 20% yield) and as a result the price remained extremely high. When it was released in 1954, the Regency TR-1 cost $49.95 (equivalent to $ today) and sold about 150,000 units. Raytheon and Zenith Electronics transistor radios soon followed and were priced even higher. In 1955, Raytheon&#x27;s 8-TR-1 was priced at $80 (equivalent to $ today). By November 1956 a transistor radio small enough to wear on the wrist and a claimed battery life of 100 hours cost $29.95.

Sony&#x27;s TR-63, released in December 1957, cost $39.95 (equivalent to $ today). Following the success of the TR-63 Sony continued to make their transistor radios smaller. Because of the extremely low labor costs in Japan, Japanese transistor radios began selling for as low as $25. By 1962, the TR-63 cost as low as $15 (equivalent to $ today), which led to American manufacturers dropping prices of transistor radios down to $15 as well.

==In popular culture==
Rock &#x27;n roll music became popular at the same time as transistor radios. Parents found that purchasing a small transistor radio was a way for children to listen to their music without using the family tube radio. Sony and other Japanese companies were much faster than Americans to focus on stylish, pocket-sized radios for the youth market, helping them to dominate the radio market. American companies began using lower-cost Japanese components but their radios were less attractive or sophisticated. By 1964 no transistor radio with only US components was available; by the mid-1960s the Japanese radio components had also been supplanted by even less-expensive manufacturing in Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The Zenith Trans-Oceanic 7000 was, until 1970, the last transistor radio manufactured in the US.

Transistor radios were extremely successful because of three social forces—a large number of young people due to the post–World War II baby boom, a public with disposable income amidst a period of prosperity, and the growing popularity of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music. The influence of the transistor radio during this period is shown by its appearance in popular films, songs, and books of the time, such as the movie &quot;Lolita&quot;.

Inexpensive transistor radios running on batteries enabled many in impoverished rural areas to become regular radio listeners for the first time. Music broadcast from New Orleans and received in Jamaica through transistor radios inspired the development of ska, and less directly, reggae music.

In the late 1950s, transistor radios took on more elaborate designs as a result of heated competition. Eventually, transistor radios doubled as novelty items. The small components of transistor radios that became smaller over time were used to make anything from &quot;Jimmy Carter Peanut-shaped&quot; radios to &quot;Gun-shaped&quot; radios to &quot;Mork from Ork Eggship-shaped&quot; radios. Corporations used transistor radios to advertise their business. &quot;Charlie the Tuna-shaped&quot; radios could be purchased from Star-Kist for an insignificant amount of money giving their company visibility amongst the public. These novelty radios are now bought and sold as collectors&#x27; items amongst modern-day collectors.

== Rise of portable audio players ==
Since the 1980s, the popularity of radio-only portable devices declined with the rise of portable audio players which allowed users to carry and listen to tape-recorded music. This began in the late 1970s with boom boxes and portable cassette players such as the Sony Walkman, followed by portable CD players, digital audio players, and smartphones.

<doc id="297067" wikidata="Q1453767" url="?curid=297067" title="Fregoli delusion">
<text>The Fregoli delusion (or Fregoli syndrome) is a rare disorder in which a person holds a delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person who changes appearance or is in disguise. The syndrome may be related to a brain lesion and is often of a paranoid nature, with the delusional person believing themselves persecuted by the person they believe is in disguise.

A person with the Fregoli delusion may also inaccurately recall places, objects, and events. This disorder can be explained by &quot;associative nodes&quot;. The associative nodes serve as a biological link of information about other people with a particular familiar face (to the patient). This means that for any face that is similar to a recognizable face to the patient, the patient will recall that face as the person they know.

The Fregoli delusion is classed both as a monothematic delusion, since it only encompasses one delusional topic, and as a delusional misidentification syndrome (DMS), a class of delusional beliefs that involve misidentifying people, places, or objects. Like Capgras delusion, psychiatrists believe it is related to a breakdown in normal face perception.

==Signs and symptoms==

Signs and symptoms of Fregoli&#x27;s:
* delusions
* visual memory deficit
* deficit in self-monitoring
* deficit in self-awareness
* hallucinations
* deficit in executive functions
* deficit in cognitive flexibility
* history of seizure activity
* epileptogenic activity

==Causes==

===Levodopa treatment===
Levodopa, also known as L-DOPA, is the precursor to several catecholamines, specifically of dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine. It is clinically used to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease and dopamine-responsive dystonia. Clinical studies have shown that the use of levodopa can lead to visual hallucinations and delusions. In most patients, delusions were more salient than hallucinations. With prolonged use of levodopa, the delusions occupy almost all of a patient&#x27;s attention. In experimental studies, when the concentration of levodopa decreases, the number of reported delusions decreases as well. It has been concluded that delusions related to antiparkinsonian medications are one of the leading causes of Fregoli syndrome.

===Traumatic brain injury===
Injury to the right frontal and left temporo-parietal areas can cause Fregoli syndrome. Research by Feinberg, et al. has shown that significant deficits in executive and memory functions follow shortly after damage in the right frontal or left temporoparietal areas. Tests performed on patients that have had a brain injury revealed that basic attention ability and visuomotor processing speed are typically normal. However, these patients made many errors when they were called to participate in detailed attention tasks. Selective attention tests involving auditory targets were also performed, and brain-injured patients had many errors; this meant that they were deficient in their response regulation and inhibition.

The most profound finding in Feinberg et al.&#x27;s paper is that performance tests on the retrieval process of memory was significantly damaged in brain-injured patients. They found, however, that these patients chose incorrect answers that were related semantically (i.e., chose vegetable instead of fruit). More importantly, tests of visual memory showed that there was a severe inability in visual recollection. Overall, brain-injured patients were severely impaired in many executive functions such as self-monitoring, mental flexibility, and social reasoning.

Fregoli syndrome is an illusion of positive doubles where there is an over-familiarity with the environment. This over-familiarity may have four causes:
* impaired self monitoring — passive acceptance of inaccurate conclusions
* faulty filtering — tendency to select salient associations rather than a relevant one
* mnemonic association from routine thoughts
* perseveration — unable to come up with an alternate hypothesis

Thus, executive dysfunction appears to be necessary to identify one as having Fregoli&#x27;s syndrome.

===Fusiform gyrus===
Current research has shown that lesions in the right temporal lobe and the fusiform gyrus may contribute to DMSs. MRIs of patients exemplifying Fregoli symptoms have shown parahippocampal and hippocampal damage in the anterior fusiform gyrus, as well as the middle and inferior of the right temporal gyri. The inferior and medial of the right temporal gyri are the storage locations for long-term memory in retrieving information on visual recognition, specifically of faces; thus, damage to these intricate connections could be one of the leading factors in face misidentification disorders.

Recently, a face-specific area in the fusiform gyrus has been discovered and is close to the anterior fusiform gyrus. MRI studies performed by Hudson, et al. have shown lesions in the anterior fusiform gyrus, which is close to the face specific area (ventral fusiform cortex), may also be associated with Fregoli syndrome and other DMSs. Such damage may cause disruption in long-term visual memory and lead to improper associations of human faces.

On another note, our brains interpret visual scenes in two pathways: one is via the Parietal lobe-occipital dorsal pathway (visual spatial material is analyzed here), and the other is via the temporal-occipital ventral pathway (recognizes objects and faces). Thus, lesions in either structures or disruption of delicate connections may produce DMSs.

===Abnormal P300===
Delusional misidentification syndrome is thought to occur due to a dissociation between identification and recognition processes. The integration of information for further processing is referred to as working memory (WM). The P300 (P stands for positive voltage potential and the 300 for the 300-millisecond poststimulus) is an index of WM and is used during a WM test in DMS patients. In comparison to normal patients, DMS patients generally exhibit an attenuated amplitude of P300 at many abductions. These patients also exhibit prolonged latencies of P300 at all abductions. These implications suggest that DMSs are accompanied by abnormal WM, specifically affecting the prefrontal cortex (both outside and inside).
Past studies have shown correlations between DMS and damages to the right-hemispheric function, which has an array of functions (insight, 3D shapes, art awareness, imagination, left-hand control, music awareness, etc.). In recent years, the P300 auditory component, which forms in response to a detection task that occurs a short time after a stimulus, has acquired a great deal of recognition. The P300 component is an index of mental activity in that its amplitude increases highly with increased stimuli. This P300 component is correlated with updating the working memory to what is expected in the environment. Other findings enhance the belief that defects in the working memory are associated with DMS. Papageorgio et al.&#x27;s paper, psychological evidence for altered information processing in delusional misidentification syndromes, hypothesized that electrophysiological brain activity in the working memory and P300 component can help identify the mechanisms of DMS. Thus, they concentrated on P300 released during a working memory test in DMS patients.

Papageorgio et al. also found that DMS patients had a lower P300 amplitude in the right hemisphere compared to the control group (non-DMS patients). From this result, the researchers implied that shorter P300 amplitudes are highly correlated with gray matter abnormalities; this finding is consistent with the DMS patients&#x27; characteristics and the presence of gray-matter deterioration. DMS patients were also found to have prolonged P300 lag, and their memory performance was lower than the control groups. The researchers were, thus, able to imply that DMS patients have trouble in focusing their resources to a stimulus; this was hypothesized to be caused by the neurodegeneration of the right hemisphere. Overall, other research studies have also provided evidence in the correlation of DMS and gray-matter degeneration of the right frontal region, which controls attentional resources. This research is important, because it can help determine the mechanisms of DMS, which can then help conjure a more effective target drug and/or treatment plan for those with DMS.

==Treatment==
Once it has been positively identified, pharmacotherapy follows. Antipsychotic drugs are the frontrunners in treatment for Fregoli and other DMSs. In addition to antipsychotics, anticonvulsants and antidepressants are also prescribed in some treatment courses.

==History==

The condition is named after the Italian actor Leopoldo Fregoli, who was renowned for his ability to make quick changes of appearance during his stage act.

P. Courbon and G. Fail first reported the condition in a 1927 paper (&quot;Syndrome d&#x27;illusion de Frégoli et schizophrénie&quot;). They described a 27-year-old woman living in London who believed she was being persecuted by two actors she often saw at the theatre. She believed these people pursued her closely, taking the form of people she knew or met.

===Delusional misidentification syndromes and Fregoli===
Delusional misidentification syndromes (DMS) are rooted in the inability to register the identity of something, whether it is an object, event, place or even a person. There are various forms of DMS, such as the syndrome of subjective doubles, intermetamorphosis, Capgras syndrome and Fregoli syndrome. However, all of these various syndromes have a common denominator: they are all due to malfunctional familiarity processing during information processing. The most common syndromes are Capgras and Fregoli. Capgras syndrome is the delusional belief that a friend, family member, etc., has been replaced by a twin impostor. Fregoli syndrome is the delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person who is in disguise. Other commonalities among these syndromes are that they are discriminatory in which object(s) are misidentified. Lastly, dopamine hyperactivity is evident in all DMSs and thus, all syndromes utilize antipsychotic medications to help control DMS.

==== Coexistence of Capgras and Fregoli ====
Delusional misidentification syndromes (DMSs) are four types of syndromes: the syndrome of subjective doubles, the syndrome of intermetamorphosis, Fregoli delusion and Capgras syndrome. Of the four, Fregoli syndrome is the least frequent, followed by Capgras. Of more rarity is the coexistence of both Fregoli and Capgras syndromes. Coexistence of DMSs are enhanced when coupled with other mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other mood disorders. Depersonalization and derealization symptoms are usually manifested in patients exhibiting two misidentification delusions. However, such symptoms have been witnessed to cease once the coexisting DMSs are fully developed.
==== Fregoli syndrome for environment ====
Some patients can experience &quot;Fregoli delusion for environment&quot; or &quot;place&quot;; in this instance the patient misidentifies their current and unfamiliar location (e.g. a hospital) for a place that is familiar to them, such as their home or job. A patient can simultaneously suffer from Fregoli delusion for both persons and environments. In some cases, the patient holds the belief that they exist in both the correct and an incorrect location, a delusion that has been termed reduplicative paramnesia; the latter being a variant of the delusional misidentification syndromes.

==Current research==
The study of DMS currently remains controversial, as they are often coupled with many psychological disorders (i.e. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, etc.). Although there is an abundance of information on DMS, there are still many mysteries of the physiological and anatomical details of DMS. An accurate semiological analysis of higher visual anomalies and their corresponding topographic sites may help elucidate the aetiology of Fregoli&#x27;s and other misidentification disorders.

==In popular culture==
Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s 2015 film &quot;Anomalisa&quot; has several direct and indirect references to the Fregoli delusion. Kaufman adapted the screenplay from his 2005 audio play &quot;Anomalisa&quot;, written under the pseudonym Francis Fregoli, and the hotel that Michael stays in is called &quot;The Fregoli&quot;.

The science fiction short story &quot;Liking What You See: A Documentary&quot;, from the collection &quot;Stories of Your Life and Others&quot; by Ted Chiang, refers to Fregoli syndrome in the context of artificial targeted neurological impairment.

In March 2020, the delusion was covered in an episode of the BBC medical soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot; when Lizzie Milton (Adele James) believes she is being stalked by Joe Pasquale.

There is an oblique reference to the delusion in Marco Polo, an episode of The Sopranos. The character Russ Fegoli (R Fegoli being an anagram of Fregoli) is implied to be the father of Paulie &quot;Walnuts&quot; Gualtieri.

In Alex Garland’s 2022 folk horror film Men, the protagonist perceives the entire male population of a Herefordshire village (all played by Rory Kinnear) to share the same face.

In the 2024 movie Smile 2 Skye&#x27;s friend who dies by suicide is named Lewis Fregoli, and as shown in the first of the series Smile (2022 film), is the Smile Entity&#x27;s MO who fits Laura&#x27;s description of it &quot;wearing people&#x27;s faces like masks.&quot;

<text>In quantum mechanics, perturbation theory is a set of approximation schemes directly related to mathematical perturbation for describing a complicated quantum system in terms of a simpler one. The idea is to start with a simple system for which a mathematical solution is known, and add an additional &quot;perturbing&quot; Hamiltonian representing a weak disturbance to the system. If the disturbance is not too large, the various physical quantities associated with the perturbed system (e.g. its energy levels and eigenstates) can be expressed as &quot;corrections&quot; to those of the simple system. These corrections, being small compared to the size of the quantities themselves, can be calculated using approximate methods such as asymptotic series. The complicated system can therefore be studied based on knowledge of the simpler one. In effect, it is describing a complicated unsolved system using a simple, solvable system.

== Approximate Hamiltonians ==

Perturbation theory is an important tool for describing real quantum systems, as it turns out to be very difficult to find exact solutions to the Schrödinger equation for Hamiltonians of even moderate complexity. The Hamiltonians to which we know exact solutions, such as the hydrogen atom, the quantum harmonic oscillator and the particle in a box, are too idealized to adequately describe most systems. Using perturbation theory, we can use the known solutions of these simple Hamiltonians to generate solutions for a range of more complicated systems.

== Applying perturbation theory ==
Perturbation theory is applicable if the problem at hand cannot be solved exactly, but can be formulated by adding a &quot;small&quot; term to the mathematical description of the exactly solvable problem.

For example, by adding a perturbative electric potential to the quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom, tiny shifts in the spectral lines of hydrogen caused by the presence of an electric field (the Stark effect) can be calculated. This is only approximate because the sum of a Coulomb potential with a linear potential is unstable (has no true bound states) although the tunneling time (decay rate) is very long. This instability shows up as a broadening of the energy spectrum lines, which perturbation theory fails to reproduce entirely.

The expressions produced by perturbation theory are not exact, but they can lead to accurate results as long as the expansion parameter, say , is very small. Typically, the results are expressed in terms of finite power series in that seem to converge to the exact values when summed to higher order. After a certain order however, the results become increasingly worse since the series are usually divergent (being asymptotic series). There exist ways to convert them into convergent series, which can be evaluated for large-expansion parameters, most efficiently by the variational method. In practice, convergent perturbation expansions often converge slowly while divergent perturbation expansions sometimes give good results, c.f. the exact solution, at lower order.

In the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED), in which the electron–photon interaction is treated perturbatively, the calculation of the electron&#x27;s magnetic moment has been found to agree with experiment to eleven decimal places. In QED and other quantum field theories, special calculation techniques known as Feynman diagrams are used to systematically sum the power series terms.

=== Limitations ===

==== Large perturbations ====

Under some circumstances, perturbation theory is an invalid approach to take. This happens when the system we wish to describe cannot be described by a small perturbation imposed on some simple system. In quantum chromodynamics, for instance, the interaction of quarks with the gluon field cannot be treated perturbatively at low energies because the coupling constant (the expansion parameter) becomes too large, violating the requirement that corrections must be small.

==== Non-adiabatic states ====

Perturbation theory also fails to describe states that are not generated adiabatically from the &quot;free model&quot;, including bound states and various collective phenomena such as solitons. Imagine, for example, that we have a system of free (i.e. non-interacting) particles, to which an attractive interaction is introduced. Depending on the form of the interaction, this may create an entirely new set of eigenstates corresponding to groups of particles bound to one another. An example of this phenomenon may be found in conventional superconductivity, in which the phonon-mediated attraction between conduction electrons leads to the formation of correlated electron pairs known as Cooper pairs. When faced with such systems, one usually turns to other approximation schemes, such as the variational method and the WKB approximation. This is because there is no analogue of a bound particle in the unperturbed model and the energy of a soliton typically goes as the &quot;inverse&quot; of the expansion parameter. However, if we &quot;integrate&quot; over the solitonic phenomena, the nonperturbative corrections in this case will be tiny; of the order of or in the perturbation parameter . Perturbation theory can only detect solutions &quot;close&quot; to the unperturbed solution, even if there are other solutions for which the perturbative expansion is not valid.

==== Difficult computations ====

The problem of non-perturbative systems has been somewhat alleviated by the advent of modern computers. It has become practical to obtain numerical non-perturbative solutions for certain problems, using methods such as density functional theory. These advances have been of particular benefit to the field of quantum chemistry. Computers have also been used to carry out perturbation theory calculations to extraordinarily high levels of precision, which has proven important in particle physics for generating theoretical results that can be compared with experiment.

== Time-independent perturbation theory ==
Time-independent perturbation theory is one of two categories of perturbation theory, the other being time-dependent perturbation (see next section). In time-independent perturbation theory, the perturbation Hamiltonian is static (i.e., possesses no time dependence). Time-independent perturbation theory was presented by Erwin Schrödinger in a 1926 paper, shortly after he produced his theories in wave mechanics. In this paper Schrödinger referred to earlier work of Lord Rayleigh, who investigated harmonic vibrations of a string perturbed by small inhomogeneities. This is why this perturbation theory is often referred to as Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation theory.

=== First order corrections === 
The process begins with an unperturbed Hamiltonian , which is assumed to have no time dependence. It has known energy levels and eigenstates, arising from the time-independent Schrödinger equation:

formula_1

For simplicity, it is assumed that the energies are discrete. The superscripts denote that these quantities are associated with the unperturbed system. Note the use of bra–ket notation.

A perturbation is then introduced to the Hamiltonian. Let be a Hamiltonian representing a weak physical disturbance, such as a potential energy produced by an external field. Thus, is formally a Hermitian operator. Let be a dimensionless parameter that can take on values ranging continuously from 0 (no perturbation) to 1 (the full perturbation). The perturbed Hamiltonian is:

formula_2

The energy levels and eigenstates of the perturbed Hamiltonian are again given by the time-independent Schrödinger equation,
formula_3

The objective is to express and formula_4 in terms of the energy levels and eigenstates of the old Hamiltonian. If the perturbation is sufficiently weak, they can be written as a (Maclaurin) power series in ,
formula_5
where
formula_6

When , these reduce to the unperturbed values, which are the first term in each series. Since the perturbation is weak, the energy levels and eigenstates should not deviate too much from their unperturbed values, and the terms should rapidly become smaller as the order is increased.

Substituting the power series expansion into the Schrödinger equation produces:

formula_7

Expanding this equation and comparing coefficients of each power of results in an infinite series of simultaneous equations. The zeroth-order equation is simply the Schrödinger equation for the unperturbed system,
formula_8

The first-order equation is
formula_9

Operating through by formula_10, the first term on the left-hand side cancels the first term on the right-hand side. (Recall, the unperturbed Hamiltonian is Hermitian). This leads to the first-order energy shift,
formula_11
This is simply the expectation value of the perturbation Hamiltonian while the system is in the unperturbed eigenstate.

This result can be interpreted in the following way: supposing that the perturbation is applied, but the system is kept in the quantum state formula_12, which is a valid quantum state though no longer an energy eigenstate. The perturbation causes the average energy of this state to increase by formula_13. However, the true energy shift is slightly different, because the perturbed eigenstate is not exactly the same as formula_14. These further shifts are given by the second and higher order corrections to the energy.

Before corrections to the energy eigenstate are computed, the issue of normalization must be addressed. Supposing that
formula_15
but perturbation theory also assumes that formula_16.

Then at first order in , the following must be true:
formula_17
formula_18
formula_19

Since the overall phase is not determined in quantum mechanics, without loss of generality, in time-independent theory it can be assumed that formula_20 is purely real. Therefore,
formula_21
leading to
formula_22

To obtain the first-order correction to the energy eigenstate, the expression for the first-order energy correction is inserted back into the result shown above, equating the first-order coefficients of . Then by using the resolution of the identity:
formula_23
where the formula_24 are in the orthogonal complement of formula_25, i.e., the other eigenvectors.

The first-order equation may thus be expressed as
formula_26

Suppose that the zeroth-order energy level is not degenerate, i.e. that there is no eigenstate of in the orthogonal complement of formula_25 with the energy formula_28. After renaming the summation dummy index above as formula_29, any formula_30 can be chosen and multiplying the first-order equation through by formula_31 gives
formula_32

The above formula_33 also gives us the component of the first-order correction along formula_34.

Thus, in total, the result is,
formula_35

The first-order change in the -th energy eigenket has a contribution from each of the energy eigenstates . Each term is proportional to the matrix element formula_36, which is a measure of how much the perturbation mixes eigenstate with eigenstate ; it is also inversely proportional to the energy difference between eigenstates and , which means that the perturbation deforms the eigenstate to a greater extent if there are more eigenstates at nearby energies. The expression is singular if any of these states have the same energy as state , which is why it was assumed that there is no degeneracy. The above formula for the perturbed eigenstates also implies that the perturbation theory can be legitimately used only when the absolute magnitude of the matrix elements of the perturbation is small compared with the corresponding differences in the unperturbed energy levels, i.e., formula_37

=== Second-order and higher-order corrections === 
We can find the higher-order deviations by a similar procedure, though the calculations become quite tedious with our current formulation. Our normalization prescription gives that

formula_38

Up to second order, the expressions for the energies and (normalized) eigenstates are:

formula_39

formula_40
If an intermediate normalization is taken (in other words, if it is required that formula_41), then we obtain a nearly identical expression for the second-order correction to the correction given immediately above. To be precise, for an intermediate normalization, the last term would be omitted.

Extending the process further, the third-order energy correction can be shown to be 

formula_42
E_n^{(3)} &amp;= \frac{V_{nk_3}V_{k_3k_2}V_{k_2n}}{E_{nk_2}E_{nk_3}}-V_{nn}\frac{|V_{nk_3}|^2}{E_{nk_3}^2} \\

&amp;=\frac{V_{nk_5}V_{k_5k_4}V_{k_4k_3}V_{k_3k_2}V_{k_2n}}{E_{nk_2}E_{nk_3}E_{nk_4}E_{nk_5}}-2E_n^{(2)}\frac{V_{nk_5}V_{k_5k_4}V_{k_4n}}{E_{nk_4}^2E_{nk_5}}-\frac{|V_{nk_5}|^2}{E_{nk_5}^2}\frac{V_{nk_3}V_{k_3k_2}V_{k_2n}}{E_{nk_2}E_{nk_3}} \\

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and the states to fourth order can be written
formula_43

All terms involved should be summed over such that the denominator does not vanish.

It is possible to relate the &quot;k&quot;-th order correction to the energy to the -point connected correlation function of the perturbation in the state formula_25. For formula_45, one has to consider the inverse Laplace transform formula_46 of the two-point correlator:
formula_47
where formula_48 is the perturbing operator in the interaction picture, evolving in Euclidean time. Then
formula_49

Similar formulas exist to all orders in perturbation theory, allowing one to express formula_50 in terms of the inverse Laplace transform formula_51 of the connected correlation function
formula_52

To be precise, if we write
formula_53
then the -th order energy shift is given by 

formula_54

=== Effects of degeneracy ===
Suppose that two or more energy eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian are degenerate. The first-order energy shift is not well defined, since there is no unique way to choose a basis of eigenstates for the unperturbed system. The various eigenstates for a given energy will perturb with different energies, or may well possess no continuous family of perturbations at all.

This is manifested in the calculation of the perturbed eigenstate via the fact that the operator
formula_55
does not have a well-defined inverse.

Let denote the subspace spanned by these degenerate eigenstates. No matter how small the perturbation is, in the degenerate subspace the energy differences between the eigenstates of are non-zero, so complete mixing of at least some of these states is assured. Typically, the eigenvalues will split, and the eigenspaces will become simple (one-dimensional), or at least of smaller dimension than &quot;D&quot;.

The successful perturbations will not be &quot;small&quot; relative to a poorly chosen basis of &quot;D&quot;. Instead, we consider the perturbation &quot;small&quot; if the new eigenstate is close to the subspace . The new Hamiltonian must be diagonalized in , or a slight variation of &quot;D&quot;, so to speak. These perturbed eigenstates in are now the basis for the perturbation expansion,
formula_56

For the first-order perturbation, we need solve the perturbed Hamiltonian restricted to the degenerate subspace ,
formula_57
simultaneously for all the degenerate eigenstates, where formula_58 are first-order corrections to the degenerate energy levels, and &quot;small&quot; is a vector of formula_59 orthogonal to &quot;D&quot;. This amounts to diagonalizing the matrix 
formula_60

This procedure is approximate, since we neglected states outside the subspace (&quot;small&quot;). The splitting of degenerate energies formula_58 is generally observed. Although the splitting may be small, formula_59, compared to the range of energies found in the system, it is crucial in understanding certain details, such as spectral lines in Electron Spin Resonance experiments.

Higher-order corrections due to other eigenstates outside can be found in the same way as for the non-degenerate case,
formula_63

The operator on the left-hand side is not singular when applied to eigenstates outside , so we can write
formula_64
but the effect on the degenerate states is of formula_59.

Near-degenerate states should also be treated similarly, when the original Hamiltonian splits aren&#x27;t larger than the perturbation in the near-degenerate subspace. An application is found in the nearly free electron model, where near-degeneracy, treated properly, gives rise to an energy gap even for small perturbations. Other eigenstates will only shift the absolute energy of all near-degenerate states simultaneously.

=== Degeneracy lifted to first order ===

Let us consider degenerate energy eigenstates and a perturbation that completely lifts the degeneracy to first order of correction.

The perturbed Hamiltonian is denoted as
formula_66
where formula_67 is the unperturbed Hamiltonian, formula_68 is the perturbation operator, and formula_69 is the parameter of the perturbation.

Let us focus on the degeneracy of the formula_70-th unperturbed energy formula_28. We will denote the unperturbed states in this degenerate subspace as formula_72 and the other unperturbed states as formula_73, where formula_74 is the index of the unperturbed state in the degenerate subspace and formula_75 represents all other energy eigenstates with energies different from formula_28. The eventual degeneracy among the other states with formula_77 does not change our arguments. All states formula_72 with various values of formula_74 share the same energy formula_28 when there is no perturbation, i.e., when formula_81. The energies formula_82 of the other states formula_73 with formula_75 are all different from formula_28, but not necessarily unique, i.e. not necessarily always different among themselves.

By formula_86 and formula_87, we denote the matrix elements of the perturbation operator formula_68 in the basis of the unperturbed eigenstates. We assume that the basis vectors formula_72 in the degenerate subspace are chosen such that the matrix elements formula_90 are diagonal. Assuming also that the degeneracy is completely lifted to the first order, i.e. that formula_91 if formula_92, we have the following formulae for the energy correction to the second order in formula_93
formula_94
and for the state correction to the first order in formula_93
formula_96

Notice that here the first order correction to the state is orthogonal to the unperturbed state,
formula_97

=== Generalization to multi-parameter case ===
The generalization of time-independent perturbation theory to the case where there are multiple small parameters formula_98 in place of λ can be formulated more systematically using the language of differential geometry, which basically defines the derivatives of the quantum states and calculates the perturbative corrections by taking derivatives iteratively at the unperturbed point.

==== Hamiltonian and force operator ====
From the differential geometric point of view, a parameterized Hamiltonian is considered as a function defined on the parameter manifold that maps each particular set of parameters formula_99 to an Hermitian operator that acts on the Hilbert space. The parameters here can be external field, interaction strength, or driving parameters in the quantum phase transition. Let and formula_100 be the -th eigenenergy and eigenstate of respectively. In the language of differential geometry, the states formula_100 form a vector bundle over the parameter manifold, on which derivatives of these states can be defined. The perturbation theory is to answer the following question: given formula_102 and formula_103 at an unperturbed reference point formula_104, how to estimate the and formula_100 at close to that reference point.

Without loss of generality, the coordinate system can be shifted, such that the reference point formula_106 is set to be the origin. The following linearly parameterized Hamiltonian is frequently used
formula_107

If the parameters are considered as generalized coordinates, then should be identified as the generalized force operators related to those coordinates. Different indices label the different forces along different directions in the parameter manifold. For example, if denotes the external magnetic field in the -direction, then should be the magnetization in the same direction.

==== Perturbation theory as power series expansion ====
The validity of perturbation theory lies on the adiabatic assumption, which assumes the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are smooth functions of parameters such that their values in the vicinity region can be calculated in power series (like Taylor expansion) of the parameters:

formula_108

Here denotes the derivative with respect to . When applying to the state formula_109, it should be understood as the covariant derivative if the vector bundle is equipped with non-vanishing connection. All the terms on the right-hand-side of the series are evaluated at , e.g. and formula_110. This convention will be adopted throughout this subsection, that all functions without the parameter dependence explicitly stated are assumed to be evaluated at the origin. The power series may converge slowly or even not converge when the energy levels are close to each other. The adiabatic assumption breaks down when there is energy level degeneracy, and hence the perturbation theory is not applicable in that case.

==== Hellmann–Feynman theorems ====
The above power series expansion can be readily evaluated if there is a systematic approach to calculate the derivates to any order. Using the chain rule, the derivatives can be broken down to the single derivative on either the energy or the state. The Hellmann–Feynman theorems are used to calculate these single derivatives. The first Hellmann–Feynman theorem gives the derivative of the energy,
formula_111

The second Hellmann–Feynman theorem gives the derivative of the state (resolved by the complete basis with ),
formula_112

For the linearly parameterized Hamiltonian, simply stands for the generalized force operator .

The theorems can be simply derived by applying the differential operator to both sides of the Schrödinger equation formula_113 which reads

formula_114

Then overlap with the state formula_115 from left and make use of the Schrödinger equation formula_116 again,

formula_117

Given that the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian always form an orthonormal basis formula_118, the cases of and can be discussed separately. The first case will lead to the first theorem and the second case to the second theorem, which can be shown immediately by rearranging the terms. With the differential rules given by the Hellmann–Feynman theorems, the perturbative correction to the energies and states can be calculated systematically.

==== Correction of energy and state ====
To the second order, the energy correction reads

formula_119
where formula_120 denotes the real part function.
The first order derivative is given by the first Hellmann–Feynman theorem directly. To obtain the second order derivative , simply applying the differential operator to the result of the first order derivative formula_121, which reads

formula_122

Note that for a linearly parameterized Hamiltonian, there is no second derivative on the operator level. Resolve the derivative of state by inserting the complete set of basis,
formula_123
then all parts can be calculated using the Hellmann–Feynman theorems. In terms of Lie derivatives, formula_124 according to the definition of the connection for the vector bundle. Therefore, the case can be excluded from the summation, which avoids the singularity of the energy denominator. The same procedure can be carried on for higher order derivatives, from which higher order corrections are obtained.

The same computational scheme is applicable for the correction of states. The result to the second order is as follows
formula_125

Both energy derivatives and state derivatives will be involved in deduction. Whenever a state derivative is encountered, resolve it by inserting the complete set of basis, then the Hellmann-Feynman theorem is applicable. Because differentiation can be calculated systematically, the series expansion approach to the perturbative corrections can be coded on computers with symbolic processing software like Mathematica.

==== Effective Hamiltonian ====
Let be the Hamiltonian completely restricted either in the low-energy subspace formula_126 or in the high-energy subspace formula_127, such that there is no matrix element in connecting the low- and the high-energy subspaces, i.e. formula_128 if formula_129. Let be the coupling terms connecting the subspaces. Then when the high energy degrees of freedoms are integrated out, the effective Hamiltonian in the low energy subspace reads

formula_130

Here formula_131 are restricted in the low energy subspace. The above result can be derived by power series expansion of formula_132.

In a formal way it is possible to define an effective Hamiltonian that gives exactly the low-lying energy states and wavefunctions. In practice, some kind of approximation (perturbation theory) is generally required.

== Time-dependent perturbation theory ==
=== Method of variation of constants ===
Time-dependent perturbation theory, initiated by Paul Dirac and further developed by John Archibald Wheeler, Richard Feynman, and Freeman Dyson, studies the effect of a time-dependent perturbation applied to a time-independent Hamiltonian . It is an extremely valuable tool for calculating the properties of any physical system. It is used for the quantitative description of phenomena as diverse as proton-proton scattering, photo-ionization of materials, scattering of electrons off lattice defects in a conductor, scattering of neutrons off nuclei, electric susceptibilities of materials, neutron absorption cross sections in a nuclear reactor, and much more.

Since the perturbed Hamiltonian is time-dependent, so are its energy levels and eigenstates. Thus, the goals of time-dependent perturbation theory are slightly different from time-independent perturbation theory. One is interested in the following quantities:
* The time-dependent expectation value of some observable , for a given initial state.
* The time-dependent expansion coefficients (w.r.t. a given time-dependent state) of those basis states that are energy eigenkets (eigenvectors) in the unperturbed system.

The first quantity is important because it gives rise to the classical result of an measurement performed on a macroscopic number of copies of the perturbed system. For example, we could take to be the displacement in the -direction of the electron in a hydrogen atom, in which case the expected value, when multiplied by an appropriate coefficient, gives the time-dependent dielectric polarization of a hydrogen gas. With an appropriate choice of perturbation (i.e. an oscillating electric potential), this allows one to calculate the AC permittivity of the gas.

The second quantity looks at the time-dependent probability of occupation for each eigenstate. This is particularly useful in laser physics, where one is interested in the populations of different atomic states in a gas when a time-dependent electric field is applied. These probabilities are also useful for calculating the &quot;quantum broadening&quot; of spectral lines (see line broadening) and particle decay in particle physics and nuclear physics.

We will briefly examine the method behind Dirac&#x27;s formulation of time-dependent perturbation theory. Choose an energy basis formula_133 for the unperturbed system. (We drop the (0) superscripts for the eigenstates, because it is not useful to speak of energy levels and eigenstates for the perturbed system.)

If the unperturbed system is an eigenstate (of the Hamiltonian) formula_134 at time = 0, its state at subsequent times varies only by a phase (in the Schrödinger picture, where state vectors evolve in time and operators are constant),
formula_135

Now, introduce a time-dependent perturbing Hamiltonian . The Hamiltonian of the perturbed system is
formula_136
Let formula_137 denote the quantum state of the perturbed system at time . It obeys the time-dependent Schrödinger equation,
formula_138

The quantum state at each instant can be expressed as a linear combination of the complete eigenbasis of formula_4:

where the s are to be determined complex functions of which we will refer to as amplitudes (strictly speaking, they are the amplitudes in the Dirac picture).

We have explicitly extracted the exponential phase factors formula_140 on the right hand side. This is only a matter of convention, and may be done without loss of generality. The reason we go to this trouble is that when the system starts in the state formula_141 and no perturbation is present, the amplitudes have the convenient property that, for all ,
 = 1 and = 0 if .

The square of the absolute amplitude is the probability that the system is in state at time , since
formula_142

Plugging into the Schrödinger equation and using the fact that ∂/∂&quot;t&quot; acts by a product rule, one obtains
formula_143

By resolving the identity in front of and multiplying through by the bra formula_144 on the left, this can be reduced to a set of coupled differential equations for the amplitudes,
formula_145

where we have used equation () to evaluate the sum on in the second term, then used the fact that formula_146.

The matrix elements of play a similar role as in time-independent perturbation theory, being proportional to the rate at which amplitudes are shifted between states. Note, however, that the direction of the shift is modified by the exponential phase factor. Over times much longer than the energy difference , the phase winds around 0 several times. If the time-dependence of is sufficiently slow, this may cause the state amplitudes to oscillate. (For example, such oscillations are useful for managing radiative transitions in a laser.)

Up to this point, we have made no approximations, so this set of differential equations is exact. By supplying appropriate initial values , we could in principle find an exact (i.e., non-perturbative) solution. This is easily done when there are only two energy levels ( = 1, 2), and this solution is useful for modelling systems like the ammonia molecule.

However, exact solutions are difficult to find when there are many energy levels, and one instead looks for perturbative solutions. These may be obtained by expressing the equations in an integral form,
formula_147

Repeatedly substituting this expression for back into right hand side, yields an iterative solution,
formula_148
where, for example, the first-order term is
formula_149
To the same approximation, the summation in the above expression can be removed since in the unperturbed state formula_150 so that we have
formula_151

Several further results follow from this, such as Fermi&#x27;s golden rule, which relates the rate of transitions between quantum states to the density of states at particular energies; or the Dyson series, obtained by applying the iterative method to the time evolution operator, which is one of the starting points for the method of Feynman diagrams.

=== Method of Dyson series ===
Time-dependent perturbations can be reorganized through the technique of the Dyson series. The Schrödinger equation
formula_152
has the formal solution
formula_153
where is the time ordering operator,
formula_154
Thus, the exponential represents the following Dyson series,
formula_155
Note that in the second term, the 1/2! factor exactly cancels the double contribution due to the time-ordering operator, etc.

Consider the following perturbation problem
formula_156
assuming that the parameter is small and that the problem formula_157 has been solved.

Perform the following unitary transformation to the interaction picture (or Dirac picture),
formula_158
Consequently, the Schrödinger equation simplifies to
formula_159
so it is solved through the above Dyson series,
formula_160
as a perturbation series with small .

Using the solution of the unperturbed problem formula_161 and formula_162 (for the sake of simplicity assume a pure discrete spectrum), yields, to first order,
formula_163

Thus, the system, initially in the unperturbed state formula_164, by dint of the perturbation can go into the state formula_165. The corresponding transition probability amplitude to first order is
formula_166
as detailed in the previous section——while the corresponding transition probability to a continuum is furnished by Fermi&#x27;s golden rule.

As an aside, note that time-independent perturbation theory is also organized inside this time-dependent perturbation theory Dyson series. To see this, write the unitary evolution operator, obtained from the above Dyson series, as
formula_167
and take the perturbation to be time-independent.

Using the identity resolution
formula_168
with formula_169 for a pure discrete spectrum, write
formula_170

It is evident that, at second order, one must sum on all the intermediate states. Assume formula_171 and the asymptotic limit of larger times. This means that, at each contribution of the perturbation series, one has to add a multiplicative factor formula_172 in the integrands for arbitrarily small. Thus the limit gives back the final state of the system by eliminating all oscillating terms, but keeping the secular ones. The integrals are thus computable, and, separating the diagonal terms from the others yields
formula_173
where the time secular series yields the eigenvalues of the perturbed problem specified above, recursively; whereas the remaining time-constant part yields the corrections to the stationary eigenfunctions also given above (formula_174.)

The unitary evolution operator is applicable to arbitrary eigenstates of the unperturbed problem and, in this case, yields a secular series that holds at small times.

== Strong perturbation theory ==
In a similar way as for small perturbations, it is possible to develop a strong perturbation theory. Consider as usual the Schrödinger equation

formula_152

and we consider the question if a dual Dyson series exists that applies in the limit of a perturbation increasingly large. This question can be answered in an affirmative way and the series is the well-known adiabatic series. This approach is quite general and can be shown in the following way. Consider the perturbation problem

formula_176

being . Our aim is to find a solution in the form

formula_177

but a direct substitution into the above equation fails to produce useful results. This situation can be adjusted making a rescaling of the time variable as formula_178 producing the following meaningful equations

formula_179

that can be solved once we know the solution of the leading order equation. But we know that in this case we can use the adiabatic approximation. When formula_180 does not depend on time one gets the Wigner-Kirkwood series that is often used in statistical mechanics. Indeed, in this case we introduce the unitary transformation

formula_181

that defines a free picture as we are trying to eliminate the interaction term. Now, in dual way with respect to the small perturbations, we have to solve the Schrödinger equation

formula_182

and we see that the expansion parameter appears only into the exponential and so, the corresponding Dyson series, a dual Dyson series, is meaningful at large s and is

formula_183

After the rescaling in time formula_184 we can see that this is indeed a series in formula_185 justifying in this way the name of dual Dyson series. The reason is that we have obtained this series simply interchanging and and we can go from one to another applying this exchange. This is called duality principle in perturbation theory. The choice formula_186 yields, as already said, a Wigner-Kirkwood series that is a gradient expansion. The Wigner-Kirkwood series is a semiclassical series with eigenvalues given exactly as for WKB approximation.

== Examples ==

=== Example of first-order perturbation theory – ground-state energy of the quartic oscillator ===
Consider the quantum harmonic oscillator with the quartic potential perturbation and the Hamiltonian
formula_187

The ground state of the harmonic oscillator is
formula_188
(formula_189), and the energy of unperturbed ground state is
formula_190

Using the first-order correction formula, we get
formula_191
or
formula_192

=== Example of first- and second-order perturbation theory – quantum pendulum ===
Consider the quantum-mathematical pendulum with the Hamiltonian
formula_193
with the potential energy formula_194 taken as the perturbation i.e.
formula_195

The unperturbed normalized quantum wave functions are those of the rigid rotor and are given by
formula_196
and the energies
formula_197

The first-order energy correction to the rotor due to the potential energy is
formula_198

Using the formula for the second-order correction, one gets
formula_199
or
formula_200
or
formula_201

===Potential energy as a perturbation===
When the unperturbed state is a free motion of a particle with kinetic energy formula_202, the solution of the Schrödinger equation
formula_203
corresponds to plane waves with wavenumber formula_204. If there is a weak potential energy formula_205 present in the space, in the first approximation, the perturbed state is described by the equation
formula_206
whose particular integral is
formula_207
where formula_208. In the two-dimensional case, the solution is
formula_209
where formula_210 and formula_211 is the Hankel function of the first kind. In the one-dimensional case, the solution is
formula_212
where formula_213.

<text>The wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is an upland game bird native to North America, one of two extant species of turkey and the heaviest member of the order Galliformes. It is the ancestor to the domestic turkey (&quot;M. g. domesticus&quot;), which was originally derived from a southern Mexican subspecies of wild turkey (not the related ocellated turkey).

==Taxonomy==
The wild turkey was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current binomial name &quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;. The type locality is Mexico. The genus name &quot;Meleagris&quot; is from Ancient Greek μελεαγρις/&quot;meleagris&quot; meaning &quot;guineafowl&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;gallopavo&quot; is a late Medieval Latin word for a wild turkey: it combines Latin &quot;gallus&quot; meaning &quot;fowl&quot; and &quot;pavo&quot; meaning &quot;peacock&quot;. The word was used in 1555 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in his &quot;Historiae animalium&quot;.

Six subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;M. g. silvestris&quot; Vieillot, 1817 – south Canada and central, east USA
* &quot;M. g. osceola&quot; Scott, WED, 1890 – Florida (USA)
* &quot;M. g. intermedia&quot; Sennett, 1879 – north Texas to central east Mexico
* &quot;M. g. mexicana&quot; Gould, 1856 – northwest, central north Mexico (includes &quot;onusta&quot;)
* &quot;M. g. merriami&quot; Nelson, 1900 – west USA
* &quot;M. g. gallopavo&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 – south Mexico

==Description==
An adult male (tom or gobbler) normally weighs from and measures in length. The adult female (hen) is typically much smaller at and is long. Per two large studies, the average weight of adult males is and the average weight of adult females is . The record-sized adult male wild turkey, according to the National Wild Turkey Federation, weighed , with records of tom turkeys weighing over uncommon but not rare. Considering its maximum and average weight, it is among the heaviest flying birds in the world.

The wings are relatively small, as is typical of the galliform order, and the wingspan ranges from . The wing chord is only . The bill is also relatively small, as adults measure in culmen length. The tarsus of the wild turkey is quite long and sturdy, measuring from . The tail is also relatively long, ranging from .

Fully-grown wild turkeys have long, reddish-yellow to grayish-green legs. Each foot has three front toes, with a shorter, rear-facing toe; males have a spur behind each of their lower legs, used to spar with other males.

The body feathers are generally blackish and dark, sometimes gray-brown, overall, with a coppery sheen that becomes more complex in older males. Mature males have a large, featherless, reddish head and red throat, with red wattles on the throat and neck. The head has fleshy, unique growths called caruncles, which may be used to identify certain birds from one another. When toms are excited, a fleshy flap on the bill (called a snood) expands, and this, the wattles and the bare skin of the head and neck all become red with enhanced flow of blood to the head. Tail feathers are of the same length in adults but of different lengths in juveniles.

Males have a long, dark, fan-shaped tail and glossy, bronze wings. As with many other species of Galliformes, turkeys exhibit strong sexual dimorphism. The male is substantially larger than the female, and his feathers have areas of red, purple, green, copper, bronze, and gold iridescence. The preen gland (uropygial gland) is also larger in males compared to females. In contrast to the majority of other birds, they are colonized by bacteria of unknown function (&quot;Corynebacterium uropygiale&quot;). Males typically have at least one &quot;beard&quot;, a tuft of coarse hair-like filaments (mesofiloplumes), growing from the center of the breast. Beards grow continuously during the turkey&#x27;s lifespan and a one-year-old male has a beard up to long. Approximately 10% of females have a beard, usually shorter and thinner than that of the male.

Females have feathers that are duller overall, in shades of brown and gray. Parasites can dull the coloration of both sexes; in males, vivid coloration may serve as a signal of health. The primary wing feathers have white bars. Turkeys have approximately 5,000 to 6,000 feathers. Juvenile males are called jakes; the difference between jakes and toms is that jakes have very short &quot;beards&quot; and tail fans with longer feathers in the middle. The tom&#x27;s tail fan feathers are uniform in length. 
 
The turkey has the second-highest maximum average weight of any North American bird, after the trumpeter swan (&quot;Cygnus buccinator&quot;). By average mass, however, several other American birds surpass the mean weight of the turkey, including the American white pelican (&quot;Pelecanus erythrorhynchos&quot;), the tundra swan (&quot;Cygnus columbianus columbianus&quot;), the endangered California condor (&quot;Gymnogyps californianus&quot;), and whooping crane (&quot;Grus americana&quot;).

==Habitat==

Wild turkeys prefer hardwood and mixed conifer-hardwood forests with scattered openings such as pastures, fields, orchards and seasonal marshes. They seemingly can adapt to virtually any dense native plant community as long as coverage and openings are widely available. Open, mature forest with a variety of interspersion of tree species appear to be preferred. In the Northeast of North America, turkeys are most profuse in hardwood timber of oak-hickory (&quot;Quercus&quot;-&quot;Carya&quot;) and forests of red oak (&quot;Quercus rubra&quot;), beech (&quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot;), cherry (&quot;Prunus serotina&quot;) and white ash (&quot;Fraxinus americana&quot;). Best ranges for turkeys in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont sections have an interspersion of clearings, farms, and plantations with preferred habitat along principal rivers and in cypress (&quot;Taxodium distichum&quot;) and tupelo (&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot;) swamps.

In the Appalachian Plateau and Cumberland Plateau birds occupy mixed forest of oaks and pines on southern and western slopes, also hickory with diverse understories. Bald cypress and sweet gum (&quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot;) swamps of south Florida; also hardwood of &quot;Cliftonia&quot; (a heath) and oak in north-central Florida. Lykes Fisheating Creek area of south Florida has up to 51% cypress, 12% hardwood hammocks, 17% glades of short grasses with isolated live oak (&quot;Quercus virginiana&quot;); nesting in neighboring prairies. Original habitat here was mainly longleaf pine (&quot;Pinus palustris&quot;) with turkey oak (&quot;Quercus laevis&quot;) and slash pine (&quot;Pinus elliottii&quot;) &quot;flatwoods&quot;, now mainly replaced by slash pine plantations.

In California, turkeys live in a wide range of habitats; acorns are a favorite food, in addition to wild oats (&quot;Avena barbata&quot;), drawing turkeys to areas of open oak forest and oak savanna across the central areas of the state. They frequent the lower-elevation oak woodlands of the Sierra Nevada foothills and Coast Ranges, and the central coast north through Mendocino County, which is primarily open conifer forest with various species of ferns growing in the understory. They can also be found in the conifer foothills and fern-heavy forested areas of the Klamath Mountains and Cascade Range in the northern areas of the state. In San Diego County, turkeys tend to be found farther from the coast, usually a minimum of 30–50 miles inland, at reasonably higher elevation; there is a healthy turkey population inhabiting the montane conifer woods and open oak forest habitats of the Cleveland National Forest, a region which borders on high desert and generally receives very minimal annual precipitation. Turkeys in these areas can be found in dense thickets of manzanita (&quot;Arctostaphylos&quot;), often growing on arid hillsides, for shelter and nesting sites, as well as rocky and boulder-strewn chaparral foothills.

==Behavior==

===Flight===
Despite their weight, wild turkeys, unlike their domesticated counterparts, are agile, fast fliers. In ideal habitat of open woodland or wooded grasslands, they may fly beneath the canopy top and find perches. They usually fly close to the ground for no more than 400&quot; &quot;m (a quarter mile).

Wild turkeys have very good eyesight, but their vision is very poor at night. They will generally not see a predator until it is too late. At twilight most turkeys will head for the trees and roost well off the ground: it is safer to sleep there in numbers than to risk being victim to predators who hunt by night. Because wild turkeys do not migrate, in snowier parts of the species&#x27;s habitat like the Northeast, Rockies, much of Canada, and the Midwest, it is very important for this bird to learn to select large conifer trees where they can fly onto the branches and shelter from blizzards.

===Vocalizations===
Wild turkeys have many calls: assembly call, gobble, plain yelp, purr, cluck and purr, cluck, cutt, excited yelp, fly-down cackle, tree call, kee kee run, and putt. In early spring, males older than a year old and, occasionally to a lesser extent, males younger than a year old gobble to announce their presence to females and competing males. The gobble of a wild turkey can be heard up to a mile away. Males also emit a low-pitched &quot;drumming&quot; sound, produced by the movement of air in the air sac in the chest, similar to the booming of a prairie chicken. In addition they produce a sound known as the &quot;spit&quot;, which is a sharp expulsion of air from this air sac.

===Foraging===

Wild turkeys are omnivorous, foraging on the ground or climbing shrubs and small trees to feed. They prefer eating acorns, nuts, and other hard mast of various trees, including hazel, chestnut, hickory, and pinyon pine, as well as various seeds, berries such as juniper and bearberry, buds, leaves, fern fronds, roots, and insects. Turkeys also occasionally consume amphibians such as salamanders and small reptiles such as lizards and small snakes. Poults have been observed eating insects, berries, and seeds. Wild turkeys often feed in cow pastures, sometimes visit backyard bird feeders, and favor croplands after harvest to scavenge seeds on the ground. Turkeys are also known to eat a wide variety of grasses.

Turkey populations can reach large numbers in small areas because of their ability to forage for different types of food. Early morning and late afternoon are the desired times for eating.

===Social structure and mating===
Males are polygamous, mating with as many hens as they can. Male wild turkeys display for females by puffing out their feathers, spreading out their tails, and dragging their wings. This behavior is most commonly referred to as strutting. Their heads and necks are colored with red, white, and blue. The color can change with the turkey&#x27;s mood, with a solid white head and neck being the most excited. They use gobbling, drumming/booming, and spitting as signs of social dominance, and to attract females. Courtship begins during the months of March and April, which is when turkeys are still flocked together in winter areas.

Males may be seen courting in groups, often with the dominant male gobbling, spreading his tail feathers (strutting), drumming/booming, and spitting. In a study, the average dominant male that courted as part of a pair of males fathered six more eggs than males that courted alone. Genetic analysis of pairs of males courting together shows that they are close relatives, with half of their genetic material being identical. The theory behind team-courtship is that the less-dominant male has a greater chance of passing along shared genetic material than if he were courting alone.

When mating is finished, females search for nest sites. Nests are shallow dirt depressions engulfed with woody vegetation. Hens lay a clutch of 10–14 eggs, usually one per day. The eggs are incubated for at least 28 days. The poults are precocial and nidifugous, leaving the nest in about 12–24 hours. Turkeys are a ground nesting bird, and because of this they are heavily predated on; reproductively-active wild turkeys have a lower annual survival rate due to predation of nests.

==Positive relationships with other wild species==

Turkeys will occasionally forage with deer and squirrels, and may even play with them. By foraging together, each can help the other watch for predators with their different senses: the deer with their improved olfactory sense, the turkey with its superior sight, and squirrels providing an additional set of eyes from the air.

==Predators==
Predators of eggs and nestlings include raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), Virginia opossums (&quot;Didelphis virginiana&quot;), striped skunks (&quot;Mephitis mephitis&quot;), spotted skunks (&quot;Spilogale&quot; ssp.), red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), gray foxes (&quot;Urocyon citnereoargenteus&quot;), groundhogs (&quot;Marmota monax&quot;), among other rodents. Predators of poults in addition to nestlings and eggs also include several species of snake, namely rat snakes (&quot;Elaphe&quot; ssp.), gopher snakes (&quot;Pituophis catenifer&quot;), and pinesnakes (&quot;Pituophis&quot; ssp.).

Avian predators of poults include raptors such as bald eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;), barred owl (&quot;Strix varia&quot;), red-shouldered (&quot;Buteo lineatus&quot;), red-tailed (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;), white-tailed (&quot;Geranoaetus albicaudatus&quot;), Harris&#x27;s hawks (&quot;Parabuteo unicinctus&quot;), Cooper&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Accipiter cooperii&quot;), and broad-winged hawk (&quot;Buteo platypterus&quot;) (both likely of very small poults). Mortality of poults is greatest in the first 14 days of life, especially of those roosting on the ground, decreasing most notably after half a year, when they attain near adult sizes.
In addition to poults, hens and adult-sized fledglings (but not, as far as is known, adult male toms) are vulnerable to predation by great horned owls (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), American goshawk (&quot;Accipiter atricapillus&quot;), domestic dogs (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;), domestic cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), and red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;). Predators of both adults and poults include coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), gray wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), bobcats (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;), cougars (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;), Canada lynx (&quot;Lynx canadensis&quot;)&quot;,&quot; golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), and possibly American black bears (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;), which also will eat the eggs if they find them. The American alligator (&quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot;) is a predator to all turkeys of all ages in the Southeast and will eat them if they get too close to water. Humans are now the leading predator of adult turkeys. When approached by potential predators, turkeys and their poults usually run rather than fly away, though they may also fly short distances if pressed. Another alternative behaviour, common in Galliformes, is that when surprised with no time to flee, the poulets hide under the wings and body of the hen while she sits tight and still. Presumably, the hen has vocal and behavioural signals that trigger the poults to instinctively run to the hen for cover.

Occasionally, if cornered, adult turkeys may try to fight off predators and large male toms can be especially aggressive in self-defense. When fighting off predators, turkeys may kick with their legs, using the spurs on their back of the legs as a weapon, bite with their beak, and ram with their relatively large bodies and may be able to deter predators up to the size of mid-sized mammals. Hens have been observed chasing off at least two species of hawks in flight when their poults are threatened.

Wild turkeys are not usually aggressive towards humans, but can be frightened or provoked to behave with aggression. They are most likely to attack if startled, cornered, harassed, or if approached too closely. Attacks and potential injuries can usually be avoided by giving wild turkeys a respectful amount of space and keeping outdoor spaces clean and undisturbed. Also, turkeys that are habituated to seeing people, at places like parks or campgrounds, can be tame and will even feed from the hands of people. Male toms occasionally will attack parked cars and reflective surfaces, thinking they see another turkey and must defend their territory.

==Range and population==
The Californian turkey (&quot;Meleagris californica&quot;) is an extinct species of turkey indigenous to the Pleistocene and early Holocene of California. It became extinct about 10,000 years ago. The present Californian wild turkey population derives from wild birds re-introduced during the 1960s and 1970s from other areas by game officials. They proliferated after 2000 to become an everyday sight in the East Bay by 2015.

At the beginning of the 20th century the range and numbers of wild turkeys had plummeted due to hunting and loss of habitat. When Europeans arrived in the New World, they were found from the southeastern US to Mexico. Turkeys were first domesticated by native peoples in Mexico and brought back to Europe during colonization. European settlers brought domesticated turkeys to the northern portions of North America during the 17th century. Habitat loss and market hunting were major factors in the decline of wild populations for the next two centuries.

Game managers estimate that the entire population of wild turkeys in the United States was as low as 30,000 by the late 1930s. By the 1940s, it was almost totally extirpated from Canada and had become localized in pockets in the United States, in the north-east effectively restricted to the Appalachians, only as far north as central Pennsylvania. Early attempts used hand-reared birds, a practice that failed miserably as the birds were unable to survive in the wild at all and many had imprinted far too much on humans to effectively survive. Game officials later made efforts to protect and encourage the breeding of the surviving wild population. They would wait for numbers to grow, catch the surplus birds with a device that would have a projectile net that would ensnare the creature, move it to another unoccupied territory, and repeat the cycle. Over time this included some in the western states where it was not native. There is evidence that the bird does well when near farmland, which provides grain and also berry-bearing shrubs at its edges. As wild turkey numbers rebounded, hunting became legal in 49 U.S. states (excluding Alaska). In 1973, the total U.S. population was estimated to be 1.3 million, and current estimates place the entire wild turkey population at 7 million individuals. Since the 1980s, &quot;trap and transfer&quot; projects have reintroduced wild turkeys to several provinces of Canada as well, sometimes from across the border in the United States. They appear to be very successful as of 2018 as wild turkeys have multiplied rapidly and flourished in places where they were not expected to survive by Canadian scientists, often quite far north of their original expected range.

Attempts to introduce the wild turkey to Britain as a game bird in the 18th century were not successful. George II is said to have had a flock of a few thousand in Richmond Park near London, but they were too easy for local poachers to destroy, and the fights with poachers became too dangerous for the gamekeepers. They were hunted with dogs and then shot out of trees where they took refuge. Several other populations, introduced or escaped, have survived for periods elsewhere in Britain and Ireland, but seem to have died out, perhaps from a combination of lack of winter feed and poaching. Small populations, probably descended from farm as well as wild stock, in the Czech Republic and Germany have been more successful, and there are wild populations of some size following introductions in Hawaii and New Zealand.

==Subspecies==
There are subtle differences in the coloration, habitat, and behavior of the different subspecies of wild turkeys. The six subspecies are:

===Eastern wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo silvestris&quot;) ===

This was the turkey subspecies Europeans first encountered in the wild: by the Puritans, the founders of Jamestown, the Dutch who lived in New York, and by the Acadians. Its range is one of the largest of all subspecies, covering the entire eastern half of the United States from Maine in the north to northern Florida and extending as far west as Minnesota, Illinois, and into Missouri. In Canada, its range extends into Southeastern Manitoba, Ontario, Southwestern Quebec (including Pontiac, Quebec and the lower half of the Western Quebec Seismic Zone), and the Maritime Provinces. They number from 5.1 to 5.3 million birds. They were first named &#x27;forest turkey&#x27; in 1817, and can grow up to tall. The upper tail coverts are tipped with chestnut brown. Males can reach in weight. The eastern wild turkey is heavily hunted in the Eastern USA and is the most hunted wild turkey subspecies.

===Osceola wild turkey or Florida wild turkey (&quot;M. g. osceola&quot;) ===
Most common in the Florida peninsula, they number from 80,000 to 100,000 birds. This bird is named for the famous Seminole leader Osceola, and was first described in 1890. It is smaller and darker than the eastern wild turkey. The wing feathers are very dark with smaller amounts of the white barring seen on other subspecies. Their overall body feathers are an iridescent green-purple color. They are often found in scrub patches of palmetto and occasionally near swamps, where amphibian prey is abundant. Osceola turkeys are the smallest subspecies weighing .

===Rio Grande wild turkey (&quot;M. g. intermedia&quot;) ===

The Rio Grande wild turkey ranges through Texas to Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Colorado, Oregon, Utah, and was introduced to central and western California, as well as parts of a few northeastern states. It was also introduced to Hawaii in the late 1950s. Population estimates for this subspecies are around 1,000,000. This subspecies, native to the central plain states, was first described in 1879, and has relatively long legs, better adapted to a prairie habitat. Its body feathers often have a green-coppery sheen. The tips of the tail and lower back feathers are a buff-to-very light tan color. Its habitats are brush areas next to streams, rivers or mesquite, pine and scrub oak forests. The Rio Grande turkey is gregarious.

===Merriam&#x27;s wild turkey (&quot;M. g. merriami&quot;) ===

The Merriam&#x27;s wild turkey ranges through the Rocky Mountains and the neighboring prairies of Wyoming, Montana and South Dakota, as well as much of the high mesa country of New Mexico, Arizona, southern Utah and the Navajo Nation, with number from 334,460 to 344,460 birds. The subspecies has also been introduced into Oregon. The initial releases of Merriam&#x27;s turkeys in 1961 resulted in establishing a remnant population of Merriam&#x27;s turkeys along the east-slope of Mt. Hood and natural immigration of turkeys from Idaho has established Merriam&#x27;s flocks along the eastern border of Oregon. Merriam&#x27;s wild turkeys live in ponderosa pine and mountainous regions. The subspecies was named in 1900 in honor of Clinton Hart Merriam, the first chief of the U.S. Biological Survey. The tail and lower back feathers have white tips and purple and bronze reflections.

===Gould&#x27;s wild turkey (&quot;M. g. mexicana&quot;) ===

Native from the central valleys to the northern mountains of Mexico and the southernmost parts of Arizona and New Mexico. Gould&#x27;s wild turkeys are heavily protected and regulated. The subspecies was first described in 1856. They exist in small numbers in the U.S. but are abundant in northwestern portions of Mexico. A small population has been established in southern Arizona. Gould&#x27;s are the largest of the six subspecies. They have longer legs, larger feet, and longer tail feathers. The main colors of the body feathers are copper and greenish-gold. This subspecies is heavily protected owing to its skittish nature and threatened status.

===South Mexican wild turkey (&quot;M. g. gallopavo&quot;) ===
The south Mexican wild turkey is considered the nominate subspecies, and the only one that is not found in the United States or Canada. In central Mexico, archaeological &quot;M. gallopavo&quot; bones have been identified at sites dating to 800–100&quot; &quot;BC. It is unclear whether these early specimens represent wild or domestic individuals, but domestic turkeys were likely established in central Mexico by the first half of the Classic Period (c. AD&quot; &quot;200–1000). Late Preclassic (300&quot; &quot;BC–AD&quot; &quot;100) turkey remains identified at the archaeological site of El Mirador (Petén, Guatemala) represent the earliest evidence of the export of the south Mexican wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo gallopavo&quot;) to the ancient Maya world. The south Mexican wild subspecies, &quot;M. g. gallopavo&quot;, was domesticated either in Mexico or by Preclassic peoples in Mesoamerica, giving rise to the domestic turkey (&quot;M. g. domesticus&quot;). The Spaniards brought this tamed subspecies back to Europe with them in the mid-16th century; from Spain it spread to France and later Britain as a farmyard animal, usually becoming the centerpiece of a feast for the well-to-do. By 1620 it was common enough so that Pilgrim settlers of Massachusetts could bring turkeys with them from England, unaware that it had a larger close relative already occupying the forests of Massachusetts. It is one of the smallest subspecies and is best known in Spanish from its Aztec-derived name, . This wild turkey subspecies is thought to be critically endangered, as of 2010.

==Benjamin Franklin and the myth of U.S. national bird suggestion==
The idea that Benjamin Franklin preferred the turkey as the national bird of the United States comes from a letter he wrote to his daughter Sarah Bache on 26 January 1784. The main subject of the letter is a criticism of the Society of the Cincinnati, which he likened to a chivalric order, which contradicted the ideals of the newly founded American republic. In one section of the letter, Franklin remarked on the appearance of the bald eagle on the Society&#x27;s crest:

Franklin never publicly voiced opposition to the bald eagle as a national symbol, nor did he ever publicly suggest the turkey as a national symbol.

==Significance to Native Americans==

The wild turkey, throughout its range, plays a significant role in the cultures of many Native American tribes all over North America. It is a favorite meal in eastern tribes. Eastern Native American tribes consumed both the eggs and meat, sometimes turning the latter into a type of jerky to preserve it and make it last through cold weather. They provided habitat by burning down portions of forests to create meadows which would attract mating birds, and thus give a clear shot to hunters. The feathers of turkeys also often made their way into the rituals and headgear of many tribes. Many leaders, such as Catawba chiefs, traditionally wore turkey feather headdresses.

Significant peoples of several tribes, including Muscogee Creek and Wampanoag, wore turkey feather cloaks. The turkey clan is one of the three Lenape clans. Movements of wild turkeys inspired the Caddo tribe&#x27;s turkey dance. The Navajo people of Northeastern Arizona, New Mexico and Utah call the turkey and relate the bird to the corn and seeds which The Turkey in Navajo folklore brought from the Third Navajo World. It is one of the Navajos&#x27; sacred birds, with the Navajo people using the feathers and parts in multiple traditional ceremonies.

<text>Carol Gilligan (; born November 28, 1936) is an American feminist, ethicist, and psychologist, best known for her work on ethical community and ethical relationships.

Gilligan is a professor of Humanities and Applied Psychology at New York University and was a visiting professor at the Centre for Gender Studies and Jesus College at the University of Cambridge until 2009. She is known for her book &quot;In a Different Voice&quot; (1982), which criticized Lawrence Kohlberg&#x27;s stages of moral development.

In 1996, &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed her among America&#x27;s 25 most influential people. She is considered the originator of the ethics of care.

==Background and family life==
Carol Gilligan was raised in a Jewish family in New York City. She was the only child of a lawyer, William Friedman, and nursery school teacher, Mabel Caminez. She attended the public Hunter Model School and the Walden School, a progressive private school on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side and played piano.

Gilligan received her B.A. &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in English literature from Swarthmore College, a master&#x27;s degree in clinical psychology from Radcliffe College, and a Ph.D. in social psychology from Harvard University where she wrote her doctoral dissertation &quot;Responses to Temptation: An Analysis of Motives&quot;. Disillusioned by academia, Gilligan left academia to pursue a career in modern dance.

She is married to James Gilligan, M.D., who directed the Center for the Study of Violence at Harvard Medical School.

Together, James and Carol had three children: Jonathan, Timothy, and Christopher. Jonathan Gilligan is a professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences and professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Vanderbilt University. Jonathan has also collaborated with his mother, to write the play &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (a feminist adaptation of Hawthorne&#x27;s novel) and the libretto for the opera &quot;Pearl&quot;. Timothy Gilligan is the vice-chair for Education and associate professor of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute. Christopher Gilligan is the Associate Chief Medical Officer of Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital and Director of the Brigham and Women&#x27;s Spine Center.

==Career==
She began her teaching career as a lecturer at the University of Chicago (where her husband was a medical intern) from 1965 to 1966, teaching the Introduction to Modern Social Science. She then became a lecturer at Harvard University in 1967, lecturing on General Education. After becoming an assistant professor in the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 1971, she received tenure there in 1988 as a full professor. Gilligan taught for two years at the University of Cambridge (from 1992 to 1994) as the Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions and as a visiting professorial fellow in the Social and Political Sciences. In 1997, she became Patricia Albjerg Graham Chair in Gender Studies at Harvard. From 1998 until 2001, she was a Visiting Meyer Professor and later visiting professor at New York University School of Law.

Gilligan eventually left Harvard in 2002 to join New York University as a full professor with the School of Education and the School of Law. She was also a visiting professor at the University of Cambridge in the Centre for Gender Studies from 2003 until 2009.

Gilligan studied women&#x27;s psychology and girls&#x27; development and co-authored or edited a number of texts with her students. She contributed the piece &quot;Sisterhood Is Pleasurable: A Quiet Revolution in Psychology&quot; to the 2003 anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women&#x27;s Anthology for a New Millennium&quot;, edited by Robin Morgan. She published her first novel, &quot;Kyra&quot;, in 2008. In 2015, Gilligan taught for a semester at New York University in Abu Dhabi.

===Psychology===
Gilligan is known for her work with Lawrence Kohlberg on his stages of moral development as well as her criticism of his approach to the stages. As his research assistant, Gilligan argued that Kohlberg&#x27;s stages were male-oriented, which limited their ability to be generalized to females. In an article where Gilligan revisited &quot;In a Different Voice&quot;, she commented: 

Gilligan proposed her theory of stages of female moral development based on her idea of moral voices. According to Gilligan, there are two kinds of moral voices: that of the masculine and the feminine. The masculine voice is &quot;logical and individualistic&quot;, meaning that the emphasis in moral decisions is protecting the rights of people and making sure justice is upheld. The feminine voice places more emphasis on protecting interpersonal relationships and taking care of other people. This voice focuses on the &quot;care perspective&quot;, which means focusing on the needs of the individual in order to make an ethical decision. For Gilligan, Kohlberg&#x27;s stages of moral development were emphasizing the masculine voice, making it difficult to accurately gauge a woman&#x27;s moral development because of this incongruity in voices. Gilligan argues that androgyny, or integrating the masculine and the feminine, is the best way to realize one&#x27;s potential as a human. Gilligan&#x27;s stages of female moral development has been shown in business settings as an explanation to the different ways men and women handle ethical issues in the workplace as well.

Gilligan developed her own stages of moral development with the idea that women make moral and ethical decision based on how they will affect others in mind. She followed Kohlberg&#x27;s stages of preconventional, conventional, and postconventional morality, but she based these upon her research with women rather than men, a major advance in psychological theory. These three stages also have two transitions between the three steps of morality.

The first stage is pre-conventional morality. This stage revolves around self-interest and survival. When a conflict arises between the needs of oneself and the needs of others, a woman will choose her own needs first. Transition number one states that during this transition, a woman realizes her responsibility for others and that she could have previously been thinking selfishly. The second stage of three is conventional morality. This stage revolves around being selfless and prioritizing care for others. A woman realizes the needs of others and cares for them over herself, leading to self-sacrifice. After the second stage is the second of the two transitions. Transition two states that during the second transition, a woman realizes her needs are just as important as the needs of others. She realizes she must balance the needs of herself and the needs of others. This is a shift from &quot;goodness&quot; to &quot;truth&quot; as she honestly assesses the needs of each, not just as a responsibility. Finally, the third stage is post-conventional morality. This stage involves women paying attention to how their actions affect others, and taking responsibility for those consequences, good and bad. Women also take control of their own lives and show strong care for others. Here, a woman realizes the needs of herself are just as important as the needs of others, thus leading to the universal ethic of care and concern.

&quot;In a Different Voice&quot; by Gilligan goes deeper into her criticism of Kohlberg and the moral development stages of women, and was one of the accomplishments that put her at the forefront of the feminist movement.

==Selected works==
===Writing===
As a feminist, Gilligan has many works on women, especially girls during the time of adolescence. The following works are a few of her most notable pieces.

====&quot;In a Different Voice&quot;====
After entering the dialogue regarding women and morality in the 1960s, Gilligan published what is considered one of her most influential works in 1982. Before she conducted her research Gilligan knew that &quot;psychologists had assumed a culture in which men were the measure of humanity, and autonomy and rationality (&#x27;masculine&#x27; qualities) were the markers of maturity. It was a culture that counted on women not speaking for themselves&quot;. She wanted there to be an opportunity for women to speak up since the nature of psychology led people to believe women had inferior qualities. To explore this theory further, Gilligan conducted her research using an interview method. Her questions centered around the self, morality and how women handle issues of conflict and choice. Her three studies that she references throughout the work were the &quot;college student study&quot; (moral development), &quot;the abortion decision study&quot; (experience of conflict), and &quot;the rights and responsibilities study&quot; (concepts of self and morality across men and women of different ages). From these studies Gilligan formed the framework for her ethics of care.

Gilligan also makes commentary on how current theory did not apply as easily when looking at a woman&#x27;s perspective. She uses Freud as her first example, as he relied on &quot;the imagery of men&#x27;s lives in charting the course of human growth.&quot; Yet in doing so, Freud struggled to apply his work to the experiences of women as well. Gilligan continues to target this absence of the feminist perspective by look at a scenario involving two adolescent children. By using Kohlberg&#x27;s six stages of moral development, Gilligan attempts to analyze both the boy and girl&#x27;s answers to the question of whether a man should steal medicine to save his wife. Gilligan realizes that the girl&#x27;s responses seem to place her a whole stage lower in maturity than the boy. However, Gilligan argues that this is a result of the children seeing two different moral problems. The boy sees this as a problem of logic whereas the girl seems to see this as a problem of human relationships. Gilligan points out that Kohlberg&#x27;s explanation gives reason for why the boy&#x27;s perspective is more mature, but gives no reason why the girl&#x27;s perspective may be just as mature in other ways, suggesting the Kohlberg&#x27;s system does not apply to all. In conducting a second interview between two new participants of the opposite gender, she finds similar results where the girl sees the situation less in terms of logic, but more in terms of a web of human relationships. Gilligan concludes this section saying how Freud is not necessarily correct in saying that girls have an intensification of narcissism during puberty, but that they develop a deeper perspective of care and &quot;a new responsiveness to the self&quot;.

Furthermore, Gilligan introduces &quot;In a Different Voice&quot; by explaining that &quot;the different voice I describe is characterized not by gender but theme. Its association with women is an empirical observation, and is primarily through women&#x27;s voices that I trace its development. But this association is not absolute and the contrasts between male and female voices are presented here to highlight a distinction between two modes of thought and to focus on a problem of interpretation rather than to represent a generalization about either sex.&quot; Regardless of the findings Gilligan made from her study, her ethics of care and the fuel for her study have called future researchers to broaden the scope of studies and consider intersectionality more as well.

As of 2022, &quot;In a Different Voice&quot; had been translated into 20 different languages and sold over 700,000 copies.

====&quot;The Birth of Pleasure: A New Map of Love&quot;====
In &quot;The Birth of Pleasure&quot;, Gilligan tests her concepts of what the best way is to find love through the historical stories of Adam and Eve, Cupid, Anne Frank, and the doomed love of Almasy and Katherine in the English Patient. Gilligan writes about why humans experience so much pain before finding pleasure in love. Gilligan considers the power of love and how it upsets the order of things. Throughout her book she wonders, what is the best way to find love?

In Marilyn N. Metzl&#x27;s book review on &quot;The Birth of Pleasure,&quot; she says:Gilligan&#x27;s book traces love&#x27;s path as she studies children&#x27;s communication and couples in crisis, and argues persuasively that a child&#x27;s inborn ability to love freely and live authentically becomes inhibited by patriarchal structure. Gilligan demonstrates how parents and patriarchal culture reinforces the loss of voice in girls while simultaneously forcing and shaming sons into masculine behavior characterized by assertion and aggression. Girls or boys who challenge this system and assume the role of the opposite sex are severely punished by the culture.

====&quot;Meeting at the Crossroads: Women&#x27;s Psychology and Girls&#x27; Development&quot;====
Gilligan co-wrote &quot;Meeting at Crossroads&quot; with Mikel Brown to discuss the path for girls during adolescence. In their book, they conduct research on 100 girls who were going through adolescence. They studied the feelings and thoughts of the girls who enter adolescence and offer insights into girls&#x27; development and women&#x27;s psychology.

Gilligan and Brown explore the heightened psychological risks of girls going through adolescence. By conducting a five-year study of girls, starting at age 12, Gilligan and Brown observe the psychological development of these girls. These problems have been seen as central to the psychology of women and their development.

====&quot;Women, Girls and Psychotherapy: Reframing Resistance&quot;====
Gilligan, Annie G. Rogers, and Deborah L. Tolman worked together to produce &quot;Women, Girls, and Psychotherapy: Reframing Resistance&quot;. In the book, Gilligan, Rogers, and Tolman examine the needs of adolescent teenage girls. This book looks at the behavior of girls, especially their resistance, to find it used as a political strategy and a health-sustaining process.

====&quot;Making Connections: The Relational Worlds of Adolescent Girls at Emma Willard School&quot;====
Gilligan, Nona P. Lyons, and Trudy J. Hanmer wrote &quot;Making Connections: The Relational Worlds at Emma Willard School&quot;. Lyons is a director of the Teacher Education Program at Brown University. Hanmer is the associate principal at Emma Willard School. The three women put together their different expertise to write about how adolescence is a critical time in girls lives — a time when &quot;girls are in danger of losing their voices and thus losing connection with others&quot;. Girls connections with others links to the psychology of women and the nature of relationships. This book discusses girls connections and relationships, while simultaneously examining women&#x27;s silences.

This book includes the voices of girls in adolescence to further examine their ideas of self, relationship, and morality, which are all crucial to the psychology of human development. Each story helps illuminate the questions that arose during the research.

====&quot;Mapping the Moral Domain: A Contribution of Women&#x27;s Thinking to Psychological Theory&quot;====
Gilligan, Janie Victoria Ward, Betty Bardige, and Jill McLean Taylor write &quot;Mapping the Moral Domain&quot; to expand the theoretical base of Gilligan&#x27;s novel &quot;In a Different Voice&quot;. The authors contrast the different way men and women speak about their relationship with evidence that suggests the different meanings of connection, dependence, autonomy, responsibility, loyalty, peer pressure, and violence. The authors map moral domain with the emphasis of including women&#x27;s voices for developmental psychology and education for both men and women. This book is a contribution of women&#x27;s thinking to psychology theory and education.

In Gilligan&#x27;s previous book, &quot;In a Different Voice&quot;, Gilligan called the two different perspectives &quot;gender specific&quot;. With her three colleagues in this book, they soften the term to &quot;gender related&quot;. They say that each sex can answer moral dilemmas through the other gender&#x27;s perspective.

===Theater===
Gilligan and Kristin Linklater co-founded an all-female theater group called the Company of Women in 1991. For the group, Linklater was the voice instructor. Around this time, Gilligan attended a Shakespeare &amp; Company workshop on acting. Gilligan&#x27;s theater work and gained knowledge on what &quot;voice&quot; really is led Tina Packer to ask Gilligan to draft a script for &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;. 

In early fall of 2002, Gilligan released a theater adaptation of &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, originally written by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Gilligan&#x27;s son, Jonathan Gilligan, worked on writing the play with her. The play first opened on September 14, 2002, at Shakespeare &amp; Company in Lenox, Massachusetts. While most of the story&#x27;s content remained the same, Gilligan used the play as a vehicle to present many of the concepts on which she had been working. She related how the patriarchy not only maintains strict gender roles, but also how it prevents true pleasure in relationships between people. Gilligan said that Hawthorne was demonstrating that &quot;you could overthrow kings, and still the tension between puritanical society and love and passion would continue&quot;. In Gilligan&#x27;s adaption, she suggested that we have inherited Pearl&#x27;s world where women do not necessarily have to worry about having an &quot;A&quot; on their breasts.

==Theories==
In her book &quot;In a Different Voice&quot; Gilligan presented her ethics of care theory as an alternative to Lawrence Kohlberg&#x27;s hierarchal and principled approach to ethics. In contrast to Kohlberg, who claimed that girls, and therefore also women, did not in general develop their moral abilities to the highest levels, Gilligan argued that women approached ethical problems differently from men. According to Gilligan, women&#x27;s moral viewpoints center around the understanding of responsibilities and relationship whilst men&#x27;s moral viewpoints instead center around the understanding of moral fairness, which is tied to rights and rules. Women also tend to see moral issues as a problem of conflicting responsibilities rather than competing rights. So whilst women perceive the situation as more contextual and narrative, men define the situation as more formal and abstract. In her 2011 article about &quot;In a Different Voice,&quot; Gilligan says she has made &quot;a distinction [she] ha[s] come to see as pivotal to understanding care ethics. Within a &quot;patriarchal&quot; framework, care is a feminine ethic. Within a &quot;democratic&quot; framework, care is a human ethic. A feminist ethic of care is a different voice within a patriarchal culture because it joins reason with emotion, mind with body, self with relationships, men with women, resisting the divisions that maintain a patriarchal order&quot;. She calls the different moral approaches &quot;ethics of care&quot; and &quot;ethics of justice&quot; and recognizes them as fundamentally incompatible.

==Criticism==
Her ethics of care have been criticized by other feminist scholars such as Jaclyn Friedman, who argues that the different ethics of women and men are in fact a result of societal expectations. Since society expects women and men to think differently about ethics, women and men as a result do present differences. The different modes of reasoning are therefore a socially constructed dichotomy simply reproducing itself through our expectations of how women and men act. Christina Hoff Sommers argued that Gilligan&#x27;s research is ill-founded and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.

Dennis M. Senchuk makes a different critique of Gilligan&#x27;s work, saying she uses hypothetical dilemmas in her theory. Senchuk thinks that Gilligan is unwilling to agree to Kohlberg&#x27;s ideas because she does not agree with the reasoning on males, resulting in the exaggeration of the differences between males and females. Senchuk also notes the similarities between Gilligan&#x27;s theory and Schopenhauer&#x27;s misogyny. He recommends that her theory should be &quot;extended - by the imagination - beyond the here and now&quot; and not be restricted to the current network of personal relationships.

<text>Ciudad del Este (, Spanish for Eastern City; often shortened as CDE) is the second-largest city in Paraguay and capital of the Alto Paraná Department, situated on the Paraná River. It is located 327 km east of Asunción, the capital, and is adjacent to the border with Brazil, to which it is connected by the Friendship Bridge on the Paraná River. It is the largest city within the Triple Frontier region, which borders Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil and Puerto Iguazú, Argentina. The Itaipú Dam, one of the largest hydroelectric power plants in the world, is near Ciudad del Este, as is the Iguazu Falls.

Ciudad del Este is a commercial city, and is one of the largest free-trade zones in the world. Its tax-free status attracts many Brazilians and Argentines to the city.

Ciudad del Este has consulates for Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Slovakia, Syria, Turkey, and Taiwan.

The city is home to Club Atlético 3 de Febrero, whose home ground Estadio Antonio Aranda was used for the 1999 Copa América and is Paraguay&#x27;s third biggest football stadium.

The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ciudad del Este.

== History ==
After the fall of Argentine President Juan Domingo Perón in the 1950s, the government of Alfredo Stroessner took the decision to vigorously promote the so-called &quot;March to the East&quot;, seeking to reach the Atlantic Ocean, through Brazil. The main problem encountered in the exit through the Río de la Plata was the excessively expensive freight, which made the exported products commercially uncompetitive. In 1955, the Mixed Paraguayan-Brazilian Commission was set up to boost the highway to the East, and in 1956 a reconnaissance flight was made on Alto Paraná. The construction of a road route to the Paraná River bank was led by Captain Porfirio Pereira Ruiz Díaz, who supervised several army units in the building of a 200-kilometre section from Coronel Oviedo.

On 3 February 1957, the city now known as Ciudad del Este was founded by decree, but with the name of &quot;Puerto Flor de Lis&quot; (&quot;Port Lily Flower&quot;) close by a location known as Tacuru pucu (&quot;Tall Termite Hill&quot; in the Guarani) which was for a time the upper limit of navigation on the Paraná River.

Later, it was renamed &quot;Puerto Presidente Stroessner&quot; (&quot;President Stroessner Port&quot;), in honor of the dictator Alfredo Stroessner.

After the 1989 Paraguayan coup d&#x27;état, a referendum was held to decide on a new name, and Ciudad del Este (&quot;East City&quot;) was chosen.

Settlement in the region was hampered by dense jungle, but the city and the local economy expanded rapidly after the construction of the Friendship Bridge and the Acaray and Itaipu dams during the 1960s and 1970s. The city has attracted many immigrants and now has sizeable Chinese, Arab, Indian, and Korean populations. It is the second most developed and populated city in the country.

== Geography ==
The city, coextensive with the homonymous district, is located in south-eastern Paraguay. Part of an international tripoint known as the &quot;Triple Frontier&quot;, Ciudad del Este lies opposite the Brazilian city of Foz do Iguaçu (state of Paraná). Separated from it by Paraná River, it is linked by the Friendship Bridge. The Argentine border is located between the neighboring town of Presidente Franco and Puerto Iguazú (Misiones Province). Ciudad del Este, along with the towns and districts of Hernandarias, Minga Guazú, and Presidente Franco, forms a metropolitan area named Gran Ciudad del Este (Greater Ciudad del Este).

Ciudad del Este is on the international route that connects southeastern Bolivia (Santa Cruz) with southern Brazil. This has contributed to the city&#x27;s development as a smuggling post between Paraguay and Brazil.

=== Hydrography ===
The Paraná River borders the city to the east. The district is also surrounded by the Acaray River to the north, which separates it from Hernandarias District, while to the southwest it is surrounded by the Monday River that separates it from the municipality of Los Cedrales. In the city there are other streams, lakes, and bridges:
* Amambay Stream, on the Monday side, feeds the Republic Lake.
* Acaraymí Stream, on the Acaray side, connects with the Amambay stream underground.
* Saltito Stream, located in the southeast, serves as a boundary with the jurisdiction of Presidente Franco.
* The Republic Lake, is the recreational site &quot;&quot; in the city.
* The Yrendy Lake, located in the neighborhood Monday about 1,000 meters (1 km) from Route 7, was designated an ecological sanctuary for its beauty and natural wealth through a municipal resolution.
* The José Costa Cavalcanti bridge over the Acaray river, popularly known as &quot;Puente Seco&quot; (Dry Bridge), is a junction between &quot;Mariscal López Avenue&quot; and the &quot;Itaipú Superhighway&quot; which connects the Pablo Rojas neighborhood with the Paraná Country Club of Hernandarias.
* The Peru bridge, over the Acaray river, connects the Don Bosco neighborhood with the Itaipú neighborhood of Hernandarias.

=== Climate ===
Ciudad del Este has a humid subtropical climate under Köppen&#x27;s climate classification. Summer is hot and humid, with an average of in January. The high humidity usually becomes suffocating in the heat. Winter is temperate and irregular; temperatures between and have been recorded. The average daily temperature is in July.

Ciudad del Este sees on average roughly of precipitation annually. In the winter of 1982, it snowed for the first time in the city, being the second snowfall registered in the country.

== Economy ==
Ciudad del Este is the second most important city in the country, after Asunción. It gathers 8% of Paraguayan gross domestic product, that is, about 3.5 billion dollars. Some 244 companies there operate in the Services Sector and in the Industrial Sector, among which stand out the manufacture of auto parts, the textile industry, maquilas, industries developer, and others. Since Ciudad del Este does not have rural areas, it does not have any measurable agro-livestock activity of its own, but it does serve as a regional nucleus for other adjacent urban centers which do have agro-livestock activity, such as Hernandarias, Presidente Franco and Minga Guazú. The city has a large food market with more than 800 shops selling fruits, vegetables, and clothing.

Ciudad del Este has repeatedly been on the list of notorious markets for infringing goods by the United States Trade Representative. The city is the headquarters of the company that operates the nearby Itaipu Dam.

The city&#x27;s economy (along with Paraguay&#x27;s economy) relies heavily on the mood of the Brazilian economy, as 95% of Paraguay&#x27;s share of the energy generated by the Itaipu Dam is sold to Brazil (for US$300 million), and that every day many Brazilians cross the border to buy less expensive products (US$1.2 billion, mostly electronics). Officially, you do not need to declare less than $300 worth of goods brought from Ciudad del Este to Brazil. However, it is worth noting that people have found loopholes to this law by getting some of the boys and young men sitting by the Friendship Bridge to transport any items in excess of $300.

Smuggling is a major occupation in the city, with some estimates putting the value of this black market at five times the national economy. It is reported that Lebanese immigrants with links to Hezbollah are operating money laundering activities and cocaine trafficking in the city.

In recent decades, Ciudad del Este has seen the development of a market in electronic and computer products, as well as consumer products, as well as luxury (perfumes, fine alcohols, and others). The economy of the city has diversified, led essentially by the installation of new industrial activities outside the traditional commercial focus, such as agribusiness, because in the city are located the largest agricultural companies in the country.

=== Tourism ===
It has hotels, modern shopping centers, restaurants, casino and night entertainment centers. While shopping tourism is what most characterizes Ciudad del Este, in the area there are numerous tourist attractions of various kinds, as they constitute the most striking presentation letter of the central core in the region, like the internationally known as the Triple Frontier; there, Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina converge each other:
* 20 km to the north, in Hernandarias is the Itaipú dam, one of the largest hydroelectric power plants in the world, and the Museum of the Guaraní Land;
* 8 km to the south, in President Franco are the Saltos del Monday, waterfalls on the Monday River;
* 26 km to the south is the Moisés Bertoni Scientific Monument, a protected area where is the house in which the wise man carried out his research and publications;
* 20 km to the east, on the border between Argentina and Brazil, are the majestic Iguazu Falls.

Located near the center of the city, there is founded the &quot;Lake of Republic&quot; which is surrounded by vegetation which takes advantage of the waters from the Amambay stream and has a recreation area with an open-air amphitheater which offers the community a public place to enjoy artistic and cultural events. In its surroundings there are also walkways, bike paths, rest areas, playgrounds, gym, and gastronomic venues &quot;&quot;.

The 3D Planet Museum is a space located within the Paris Shopping. These are 3D paintings hand painted by international artists, among which the Great Wall of China, the Iguazu Falls, the Roman Colosseum, Venice, Africa and outer space stand out. It also has a labyrinth of mirrors among the multiple attractions exhibited in rooms divided into five different areas. The shopping center has also a snow park.

El Turista Róga (Tourist&#x27;s home), is a dependency of the National Secretariat of Tourism (SENATUR), located in front of the Green Park, near the center of the city. This one is specialized in orientation and reception of tourists, also has a reception room and wide information suitable to deliver brochures and explanatory leaflets in languages such as English, French, Italian, German, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.

Ciudad del Este is the most populous city in the country after Asunción, with a population of 301,815 persons, including 152,393 men and 149,422 women, according to projections of the DGEEC for 2019.

It represents 36.8% of the departmental population (819,589) and 4.22% of the national population (7,152,703).

Ciudad del Este is a multicultural and diverse city. It is home to a large Asian-born population, specifically of Taiwanese, Korean, Lebanese and Iranian origin, evident in the city&#x27;s mosques and pagodas. From the 1970s, Sunni Muslim Arabs moved to the city. This changed in the 1980s to Shia Muslim Arabs from South Lebanon.

As in the rest of the country, a large part of the population is bilingual in both, Spanish and Guaraní, in addition to Jopara, but the use of Portuguese is also common for thousands of people and is mainly used in the commercial and agricultural sector. Thanks to the strong presence of Asian and Middle Eastern immigrants, languages such as Arabic, Chinese, and Korean are commonly used in the downtown area of the city both in conversation and in posters.

=== Neighborhoods ===
Ciudad del Este is organized territorially in 30 neighborhoods. Route No. 7 &quot;Dr. Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia&quot; divides the city into two parts: 9 neighborhoods in the north and 21 neighborhoods in the south. The Microcentro neighborhood is the only one located in the middle of Route 7, extending minimally on the north side.

Emblematic and popular sites such as the Alejo García park (Ex-airport) and Monseñor Agustín Van Aaken park offer different recreation areas such as bicycle paths, aerobic stations, skateboarding tracks, and other recreational games.

Along the Los Yerbales Avenue, parks like &quot;Manuel Ortiz Guerrero&quot;, &quot;José Asunción Flores&quot;, &quot;Salto del Guairá&quot;, and &quot;Guayaivi&quot; are all natural spaces whose main function is to conserve regional biodiversity. On the other hand, the Linear Park is a project financed by Itaipú Binacional and is focused on the use of the first three parks mentioned above; This project is based on the remodeling of green spaces for citizens&#x27; free access. The Linear Park, of about 50 hectares, is equipped with sanitary sewer systems, water network, video surveillance system, trails, cycle paths, free access to WIFI networks, playgrounds, outdoor gym, senior area, sector for food truck and a new effluent drainage system.

=== Urban development plan ===
Given the rapid growth of the metropolitan region, plans are being projected for the development, reconversion and urban planning with a view to converting it into a sustainable metropolis. The renovation of Ciudad del Este is being planned by architects, civil engineers and Argentine professionals with the goal of upgrading the transportation infrastructure.

<text>Harper&#x27;s Magazine is a monthly magazine of literature, politics, culture, finance, and the arts. Launched in New York City in June 1850, it is the oldest continuously published monthly magazine in the United States. &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; has won 22 National Magazine Awards.

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the magazine published works of prominent authors and political figures, including Herman Melville, Woodrow Wilson, and Winston Churchill. Willie Morris&#x27;s resignation as editor in 1971 was considered a major event, and many other employees of the magazine resigned with him. The magazine has developed into the 21st century, adding several blogs. It is related under the same publisher to Harper&#x27;s Bazaar magazine, focused on fashion, and several other &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; titles but each publication is independently produced.

According to a 2012 Pew Research Center study, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, along with the &quot;The Atlantic,&quot; and the &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, ranked highest in college-educated readership among major American media outlets.

==History==
===19th century===
&quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; began as Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine in New York City in June 1850, by publisher Harper &amp; Brothers. The company also founded the magazines &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, and grew to become HarperCollins. The first press run of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; included 7,500 copies and sold out almost immediately. Six months later, the magazine&#x27;s circulation had grown to 50,000.

The early issues reprinted material pirated from English authors such as Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, and the Brontë sisters. The magazine soon was publishing the work of American artists and writers, and in time commentary by the likes of Winston Churchill and Woodrow Wilson. Portions of Herman Melville&#x27;s novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; were first published in the October 1851 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; under the title, &quot;The Town-Ho&#x27;s Story&quot;, named after Chapter 54 of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.

===20th century===
In 1962, Harper &amp; Brothers merged with Row, Peterson &amp; Company, becoming Harper &amp; Row (now HarperCollins). In 1965, the magazine was separately incorporated, and became a division of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune Company, owned by the Cowles Media Company.

In the 1970s, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; published Seymour Hersh&#x27;s reporting of the My Lai Massacre by United States forces in Vietnam. In 1971, editor Willie Morris resigned under pressure from owner John Cowles Jr., prompting resignations from many of the magazine&#x27;s star contributors and staffers, including Norman Mailer, David Halberstam, Robert Kotlowitz, Marshall Frady, and Larry L. King:

Robert Shnayerson, a senior editor at &quot;Time&quot; magazine, was hired to replace Morris as &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; ninth editor, serving in that position from 1971 until 1976.

Lewis H. Lapham served as managing editor from 1976 until 1981, when the job was taken over by Michael Kinsley. Lapham returned to the position again from 1983 until 2006. On June 17, 1980, the Star Tribune announced it would cease publishing &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; after the August 1980 issue, but on July 9, 1980, John R. MacArthur (who goes by the name Rick) and his father, Roderick, obtained pledges from the directorial boards of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Atlantic Richfield Company, and CEO Robert Orville Anderson to amass the $1.5 million needed to establish the Harper&#x27;s Magazine Foundation. It now publishes the magazine.

In 1984, Lapham and MacArthur, now publisher and president of the foundation, respectively, along with new executive editor Michael Pollan, redesigned &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; and introduced the &quot;Harper&#x27;s Index&quot; with statistics arranged for, &quot;Readings&quot;, and the &quot;Annotation&quot; departments to complement its fiction, essays, reportage, and reviews.

===21st century===
Under the Lapham and MacArthur&#x27;s leadership, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; continued publishing literary fiction by John Updike, George Saunders, and others. Politically, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; has been a vocal critic of U.S. domestic and foreign policies. Editor Lapham&#x27;s monthly &quot;Notebook&quot; columns have lambasted the Clinton and the George W. Bush administrations. Beginning in 2003, the magazine concentrated on reporting about the Iraq War, including long articles on the battle for Fallujah, and the cronyism of the American reconstruction of Iraq. Other reporting has covered abortion issues, cloning, and global warming.

In 2007, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; added the &quot;No Comment&quot; blog by attorney Scott Horton about legal controversies, Central Asian politics, and German studies. In April 2006, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; began publishing the &quot;Washington Babylon&quot; blog on its website, written by Washington, D.C. editor Ken Silverstein about American politics; and in 2008, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; added the &quot;Sentences&quot; blog by contributing editor Wyatt Mason, about literature and &quot;belles lettres&quot;. Since that time, these two blogs have ceased publication. Another website feature, featuring a rotating set of authors, is the &quot;Weekly Review&quot;, a three-paragraph distillation of the week&#x27;s political, scientific, and bizarre news. Like &quot;Harper&#x27;s Index&quot; and &quot;Findings&quot; in the print edition of the magazine, &quot;Weekly Review&quot; items are typically arranged for ironic contrast.

As of the December 2019 issue, Julian Lucas writes the print edition&#x27;s &quot;New Books&quot; column.

==Controversies==
In September 1970, the magazine featured on its cover &quot;Homo/Hetero: The Struggle for Sexual Identity,&quot; an essay written by Joseph Epstein, who expressed his negative views of homosexuality and compared it to being &quot;condemned to a state of permanent niggerdom among men.&quot; He also wrote: “If I had the power to do so, I would wish homosexuality off the face of this earth. I would do so because I think it brings infinitely more pain than pleasure to those who are forced to live with it; because I think there is no resolution for this pain in our lifetime, only, for the majority of homosexuals, more pain and various degrees of exacerbating adjustment; and because, wholly selfishly, I find myself completely incapable of coming to terms with it….” In response, the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) submitted three articles which &quot;Harper’s&quot; refused to consider. GAA then planned a zap for October 27, 1970, which was covered by ABC-TV and WNEW-TV, and led to a three-part series on gay liberation by WOR-TV. When GAA member Arthur Evans confronted editor Midge Decter for publishing the essay, she denied that there was any anti-gay prejudice (Decter later contributed her own homophobic writing, “The Boys on the Beach,” to her husband Norman Podhoretz’s conservative magazine &quot;Commentary&quot;, which prompted Gore Vidal&#x27;s “Some Jews &amp; The Gays”). Merle Miller, a former editor at &quot;Harper’s&quot;, in the wake of &quot;Homo/Hetero,&quot; came out publicly and wrote his own article, now considered a landmark of American journalism, “What It Means to Be a Homosexual” published in the &quot;New York Times Sunday Magazine&quot; on January 17, 1971. “I am sick and tired,” he said of the article, “of reading and hearing such goddamn demeaning, degrading bullshit about me and my friends.” 

Editor Lewis H. Lapham was criticized for his reportage of the 2004 Republican National Convention, which had yet to occur, in his essay &quot;Tentacles of Rage: The Republican Propaganda Mill, a Brief History&quot;, published in the September 2004 issue, which implied that he had attended the convention. He apologized in a note. Lapham left two years later, after 28 years as &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; editor-in-chief, and launched &quot;Lapham&#x27;s Quarterly&quot;.

The August 2004 issue contained a photo essay by noted photojournalist Peter Turnley, who was hired to do a series of photo essays for the magazine. The eight-page spread in August 2004 showed images of death, grieving, and funerals from both sides of the war in Afghanistan. On the U.S. side, Turnley visited the funeral of an Oklahoma National Guard member, Spc. Kyle Brinlee, 21, who was killed when his vehicle ran over an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan. During his funeral, Turnley photographed the open casket as it lay in the back of the high school auditorium where the funeral was held to accommodate 1,200 mourners, and the photo was used in the photo essay. Brinlee&#x27;s family subsequently sued the magazine in federal court. The case ended in 2007 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the unauthorized publication was in &quot;poor taste&quot; but upheld the ruling of the Tenth Circuit that the magazine had not violated the privacy rights of the family, since the family had invited the press and, according the court, &quot;opened up the funeral scene to the public eye&quot;.

The March 2006 issue included an article by Celia Farber, &quot;Out of Control: AIDS and the Corruption of Medical Science&quot;, presenting Peter Duesberg&#x27;s theory that HIV does not cause AIDS. It was strongly criticized by AIDS activists, scientists and physicians, the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, and others as inaccurate and promoting a scientifically discredited theory. The Treatment Action Campaign, a South African organization working for greater popular access to HIV treatments, posted a response by eight researchers documenting more than 50 errors in the article.

In 2006, Lapham was succeeded as &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; editor by Roger Hodge. Since that time, the magazine has had a number of shorter-termed editors in chief, several of whom were fired amid various controversies. On January 25, 2010, the firing of the magazine&#x27;s editor, Roger Hodge, by publisher John R. MacArthur was met with criticism among the magazine&#x27;s subscribers and staff. MacArthur initially claimed Hodge was stepping down for &quot;personal reasons&quot;, but later disclosed that he fired Hodge.

Ellen Rosenbush served as editor from 2010 to 2015. She returned in January 2016 when MacArthur fired Christopher Cox, who had been named editor only three months prior in October 2015.

James Marcus assumed the post of editor in 2016. In March 2018, an essay by Katie Roiphe on the #MeToo movement excited controversy both online and inside &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;. Marcus had complained about the piece, suggesting the critique of #MeToo was inappropriate in light of &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; &quot;longtime reputation as a gentleman&#x27;s smoking club&quot;; he attributed this disagreement as a primary cause of his firing in 2018. In April 2018, Ellen Rosenbush assumed the title of editorial director. In October 2019, the magazine announced that novelist and essayist Christopher Beha would be taking over as editor, with Rosenbush remaining as editor-at-large.

In July 2020, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; published an open letter called &quot;A Letter on Justice and Open Debate&quot; criticizing &quot;illiberalism&quot; and promoting a tolerance of different viewpoints. The letter received a mixed response on Twitter with some remarking that the prominent signatories had &quot;bigger platforms and more resources than most other humans&quot; and were unlikely to face repercussions for anything they said, and others taking umbrage at particular signatories such as J. K. Rowling, who faced recent criticism for her comments on transgender issues.

<text>The bowl and doily spider (&quot;Frontinella pyramitela&quot;) is a species of sheet weaver found in North and Central America. It is a small spider, about long, that weaves a fairly complex and unique sheet web system consisting of an inverted dome shaped web, or &quot;bowl,&quot; suspended above a horizontal sheet web, or &quot;doily&quot;, hence its common name. The spider hangs from the underside of the &quot;bowl&quot;, and bites through the web small flies, gnats and other small insects that fall down into the non-sticky webbing. The webs are commonly seen in weedy fields and in shrubs, and may often contain both a male and a female spider in late summer—like many linyphiids, &quot;Frontinella&quot; males and females may cohabitate for some time. Males exhibit competition for female mates both by fighting and sperm competition. Uniquely, these spiders exhibit behavioral thermoregulation and have lengthened circadian rhythms. 

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Frontinella pyramitela&quot; was first described by Charles Walckenaer in 1841. In 1850, Nicholas Hentz described a spider which he named &quot;Linyphia communis&quot;. Both were later regarded as the same species, with &quot;Frontinella communis&quot; being a junior synonym.

== Description ==

&quot;F. pyramitela&quot; are small (4 mm, or 0.15 in) and are typically a reddish-brown color, with more yellowish colored legs. Their abdomen displays decorative white dots along the sides and has short hairs.

== Habitat and distribution ==
These spiders are found in a large variety of habitats and climates. Some of their more common habitat sites include temperate woods and alpine forests, though they can also be found in more tropical, humid areas. They are most commonly found in North America, often in the United States.

The spiders are most active from May through June, and then again in September.

== Diet ==
=== Typical prey and prey capture ===
The spiders typically eat small insects, such as gnats or small flies that fall down into its web. Once the prey falls into the web, the spider will bite the prey and inject its venom into it in order to immobilize the prey. The spider then pulls the prey into the &quot;bowl&quot; of its web and may consume it.

=== Prey memory ===
&quot;Frontinella pyramitela&quot; is likely able to retain a memory of their past prey. After prey are removed from their nests, the spiders typically search for the lost prey, with more effort being exerted if the prey was larger. The spiders are able to distinguish between the lost prey that they are looking for and other old prey remnants. Thus, it has been suggested that &quot;F. pyramitela&quot; are able to remember previous information about prey, including size and quality.

== Webs ==
=== Web design ===
The spiders&#x27; webs have an unusual design. The spiders weave a fairly complex sheet web system consisting of an inverted dome-shaped web, or &quot;bowl,&quot; suspended above a horizontal sheet web, or &quot;doily.&quot; The spider hangs from the underside of the &quot;bowl,&quot; and bites through the web prey that falls down into the non-sticky webbing. This web design allows the spider to survey its prey below the web while remaining above in a protected location. The webs are commonly seen in weedy fields and in shrubs. 

=== Cohabitation ===
The majority of spider species are solitary; it is, therefore, unique that &quot;F. pyramitela&quot; exhibit cohabitation between males and females. In these spiders, males rarely build webs and thus rely upon female snares for fodder. Male spiders typically stay at a female&#x27;s nest for much longer than the time necessary for copulation. The time that males eventually do leave the female&#x27;s nest is randomly determined and not linked to specific events. Female identity and recent prey capture by the male may influence the length of time the male stays with the female. 
== Reproduction and life cycle ==

=== Determinants of female fecundity ===
The major determinants of &quot;Frontinella pyramitela&quot; fecundity in females are female longevity, foraging success, and size. After each clutch of eggs is birthed, resulting fecundity in the mother decreases, most significantly after the second clutch is delivered. Early mortality significantly affects the spider&#x27;s lifetime fecundity.

=== Life extension by dietary restriction ===
Female &quot;F. pyramitela&quot; spiders tend to live longer lives when they have a more restricted food diet. Despite this, when the spiders have more restricted diets, they also have decreased overall fecundity and delay their egg laying.

== Mating ==

=== Courtship practices ===
The courtship practices of this spider are known to be both lengthy and elaborate and can be divided into the pre-mount and the mount phases. When the male first arrives on the female&#x27;s web, she often exhibits predatory behavior which ends upon the initiation of courtship by the male. Many behaviors in the courtship between males and females produce web-borne vibrations that in turn effect the movement and behavior of the recipient. It is suggested that these unique courtship behaviors function to help spiders of the &quot;F. pyramitela&quot; species to recognize one another, suppress female aggression, and facilitate the stimulation and synchronization of mating.

=== Pre-copulation ===
Before copulating and building a sperm nest, male spiders will assess a female&#x27;s virginity. If the male determines that the female is a virgin, he will then fill his pedipalps with sperm and begin insemination. The male assesses a female&#x27;s virginity by a signal given by the female. Females can only send the signal if they are virgins. There is no signal for a spider that has already copulated.

=== Copulation ===
Typically, the male is the one who terminates copulation; females rarely end copulation mid-way through the event. Due to this, females are usually receptive to mating for their entire adult lives. The exception to this rule is when they are about to deposit an egg sac. They tend to copulate for significantly longer than the required fifteen minutes. One explanation of the purpose of this lengthened copulation time is that longer copulations result in larger hatchlings.

=== Pheromones ===
Male courtship of females has been linked to chemical pheromone release. This pheromone is specific to the &quot;Frontinella pyramitela&quot; species, distinct from other similar spiders&#x27; pheromones. The pheromones are released by mature females only. These pheromones have the dual functions of both letting males know that the female spider is ready to mate, as well as making the female appear more attractive to the male. It is the pheromone itself that attracts the male, not the actual physical presence of the female spider.

=== Male competition over mates ===
Male spiders are known to fight over access to potential female mates. The longer that these fights between males go on, the higher the risk that the males will injure, or even kill one another. When the value of a female is considered equal to two males (determined by war of attrition game theory), the male with the larger body size tends to win. The most common incidents of injury amongst males were found in smaller body sized males who were defending a female that he valued greatly.

=== Sperm competition ===
Sperm competition, which is a post-copulatory occurrence, occurs in &quot;F. pyramitela.&quot; Because females can mate with multiple males, male competition for female mates occurs even after the physical mating is done, as the sperms must then compete for fertilization inside the female reproductive tract. The male who mates first with the female has a much higher chance of giving the sperm which will get fertilized. The male who mates second may have a small chance of fertilizing a few eggs within the clutch. &quot;F. pyramitela&quot; thus exhibit first male sperm priority.

When forced to share a habitat with the nonnative European spider species &quot;Linyphia triangularis&quot;, &quot;Frontinella pyramitela&quot; were found to abandon their nests and decrease their nest building in areas where &quot;L. triangularis&quot; was present. &quot;L. triangularis&quot; sometimes took over &quot;F. pyramitela&#x27;s&quot; web materials, web site, or even the web itself, but &quot;F. pyramitela&#x27;s&quot; never did the same to &quot;L. triangularis.&quot; 

== Physiology ==

=== Behavioral thermoregulation ===
&quot;Frontinella pyramitela&quot; regulates its behavior based on the positioning of the sun. On days when insolation and ambient temperatures are high, the spiders will align themselves with sun rays. The spider is able to change its body temperature by .5 degrees Celsius by aligning itself with sun rays when compared to when its body is perpendicular to sun rays. It is not likely that this behavior functions to help the spider regulate its body temperature. Instead, the proposed function of this behavior is to depress the spider&#x27;s metabolic rate so that the body knows to move nutrients from maintenance use to reproductive use.

=== Circadian rhythm ===
This spider has been found to deviate from the traditional 24 hour circadian rhythm, opposing the circadian resonance hypothesis. &quot;Frontinella pyramitela&quot; runs on a 28.2-hour clock, with high variability in clock length, ranging from 24 hours to 33 hours. The spiders&#x27; clock time helps determine their behavior at different hours of the day and varies throughout different seasons of the year. The significance of this long clock length is still under investigation.

== Interactions with humans ==
When exposed to a sublethal dose of the neurotoxic pesticide malathion, the normal diet periodicities, time budgets, and patterns of locomotion all shifted in &quot;Frontinella pyramitela.&quot; This is likely due to malathion&#x27;s action as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Malathion has been shown to likely reduce the species&#x27; efficiency as agents of biological control.

<doc id="297082" wikidata="Q208576" url="?curid=297082" title="Narthex">
<text>The narthex is an architectural element typical of early Christian and Byzantine basilicas and churches consisting of the entrance or vestibule, located at the west end of the nave, opposite the church&#x27;s main altar. Traditionally the narthex was a part of the church building, but was not considered part of the church proper.

In early Christian churches the narthex was often divided into two distinct parts: an esonarthex (inner narthex) between the west wall and the body of the church proper, separated from the nave and aisles by a wall, arcade, colonnade, screen, or rail, and an external closed space, the exonarthex (outer narthex), a court in front of the church façade delimited on all sides by a colonnade as in the first St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome or in the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio in Milan. The exonarthex may have been either open or enclosed with a door leading to the outside, as in the Byzantine Chora Church.

By extension, the narthex can also denote a covered porch or entrance to a building.

==Etymology==
The original meaning of the Classical Greek word &quot;narthex&quot; νάρθηξ was &quot;giant fennel&quot;.
Derived meanings are from the use of the fennel stalk as thyrsus, as a schoolmaster&#x27;s cane, as a singlestick for military exercise, or as a splint for a broken limb. The term was also used for a casket for unguents, and hence as the title of a number of medical works. 
Use for the architectural feature of church building is medieval (Byzantine Greek), in use by the 12th century (&quot;Etymologicum Magnum&quot;). English use dates from the 1670s. It isn&#x27;t clear how this meaning was derived, allegedly from a resemblance of the entrance area of the church to a hollow stem.
In Modern Greek &quot;narthekas&quot; (νάρθηκας) no longer has the classical meaning and is either the porch of a church, as English, or the brace of a sprained wrist or sling of a broken arm. 
In English the narthex is now the porch outside the church at the west end; formerly it was a part of the church building itself,
albeit not considered part of the church proper, used as the place for penitents.

==Purpose==
The purpose of the narthex was to allow those not eligible for admittance into the general congregation (particularly catechumens and penitents) to hear and partake of the service. The narthex would often include a baptismal font so that infants or adults could be baptized there before entering the nave, and to remind other believers of their baptisms as they gathered to worship. The narthex is thus traditionally a place of penitence, and in Eastern Christianity some penitential services, such as the Little Hours during Holy Week are celebrated there, rather than in the main body of the church. In the Russian Orthodox Church funerals are traditionally held in the narthex.

Later reforms removed the requirement to exclude people from services who were not full members of the congregation, which in some traditions obviated the narthex. Church architects continued, however, to build a room before the entrance of the nave. This room could be called an inside vestibule (if it is architecturally part of the nave structure) or a porch (if it is a distinct, external structure). Some traditions still call this area the narthex as it represents the point of entry into the church, even if everyone is admitted to the nave itself.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the esonarthex and exonarthex had, and still have, distinct liturgical functions. For instance, the procession at the Paschal Vigil will end up at the exonarthex for the reading of the Resurrection Gospel, while certain penitential services are traditionally chanted in the esonarthex.

In some Eastern Orthodox temples, the narthex will be referred to as the &quot;trapeza&quot; (refectory), because in ancient times, tables would be set up there after the Divine Liturgy for the faithful to eat a common meal, similar to the agape feast of the early church. To this day, this is where the faithful will bring their baskets at Pascha (Easter) for the priest to bless the Paschal foods which they will then take back to their homes for the festive break-fast. Traditionally, the narthex is where candles and prosphora will be sold for offering during Divine Services.

The doorway leading from the narthex to the nave is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Royal Doors&quot;, because in major cathedrals (&quot;catholica&quot;) there were several sets of doors leading into the nave, the central one being reserved only for the use of the Byzantine emperor.

On feast days there will be a procession to the narthex, followed by intercessory prayers, called the Litiy.

In Armenia the local style of narthex is known as a &quot;gavit&quot;.

<text>Lewis Henry Lapham II (; January 8, 1935 – July 23, 2024) was an American writer. He was the editor of the American monthly &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from 1976 until 1981, and from 1983 until 2006. He was the founder of &quot;Lapham&#x27;s Quarterly&quot;, a publication about history and literature, and wrote numerous books on politics and current affairs.

== Early life and education ==
A son of Lewis A. Lapham and Jane Foster, Lapham was born January 8, 1935, in San Francisco. He was raised in San Francisco and his father was president of the Grace Line and Bankers Trust. His grandfather Roger Lapham had been mayor of San Francisco in the 1940s, and his great-grandfather, Lewis Henry Lapham, was a founder of Texaco. Through his grandfather, Lapham was the son of the first cousin of actor Christopher Lloyd, although Lapham was three years older. As a boy, he attended the Hotchkiss School, graduating in 1952.

Lapham was educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge and Yale University, where he was a member of St. Anthony Hall.

== &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; ==
Lapham served as editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from 1976 to 2006 (with a hiatus from 1981 to 1983). He was managing editor from 1971 to 1975, after having worked for the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; and the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. He was largely responsible for the modern look and prominence of the magazine, having introduced many of its signature features, including the &quot;Harper&#x27;s Index&quot;. He announced that he would become editor emeritus in 2006, continuing to write his Notebook column for the magazine as well as editing a new journal about history, &quot;Lapham&#x27;s Quarterly&quot;. Lapham also worked with the PEN American Center, sitting on the board of judges for the PEN/Newman&#x27;s Own First Amendment Award. In 2007, he was inducted into the American Society of Magazine Editors&#x27; Hall of Fame.

Lapham wrote a September 2004 column for &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; in which he included a brief account of the Republican National Convention as if he had witnessed it, &quot;reflecting on the content and sharing with readers a question that occurred to him as he listened&quot;, as Jennifer Senior wrote in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;. The magazine arrived in subscribers&#x27; mailboxes before the convention took place, as Senior says &quot;forcing Lapham to admit that the scene was a fiction&quot;. The columnist apologized, &quot;but pointed out political conventions are drearily scripted anyway – he basically knew what was going to be said&quot;. Senior continues, &quot;By this logic, though, I could have chosen not to read &quot;Pretensions to Empire&quot; before reviewing it, since I already knew Lapham&#x27;s sensibility, just as he claims to know the Republicans.&quot;

==&quot;Lapham&#x27;s Quarterly&quot;==
Lapham retired from &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; in 2006. That year, he founded &quot;Lapham&#x27;s Quarterly&quot;, a publication about history and literature. Each issue was devoted to one subject and featured pieces by ancient writers to contemporary celebrities.

== Works ==
After spending a year studying history at the University of Cambridge, Lapham wrote for the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, and &quot;Life&quot;. He also contributed to &quot;Commentary&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, among other publications. Lapham served as a judge for the PEN/Newman&#x27;s Own First Amendment Award.

Lapham was the host and author of the PBS series &quot;America&#x27;s Century&quot; and he was host of the weekly PBS series, &quot;Bookmark&quot; from 1989 to 1991.

Lapham was until his death the host of &quot;The World in Time&quot;: radio discussions with scholars and historians on Bloomberg Radio that open the doors of history behind the events in the news. Podcasts of the weekly talks are available at Bloomberg.com.

Lapham wrote &quot;The American Ruling Class&quot; (2005), a movie done in documentary style and featuring fictional characters and real people, i.e. Bill Bradley, Hodding Carter III and Barbara Ehrenreich, author of &quot;Nickel and Dimed&quot;, pondering the question &quot;Is there a ruling class in America?&quot;, Lapham states at the movie&#x27;s conclusion that &quot;if you&#x27;re not in, you&#x27;re out&quot;. The movie aired on the Sundance Channel on July 30, 2007.

==Awards==
In 1978, Lapham received the Gerald Loeb Award for Magazines. In 2016, he received the insignia of Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters.

==Personal life==
In 1972, Lapham married Joan Brooke Reeves, the daughter of Edward J. Reeves, a stockbroker and grocery heir, and Elizabeth M. Brooke (formerly the wife of Thomas Wilton Phipps, a nephew of Nancy Astor). They had three children:
* Delphina (married &quot;Prince Don&quot; Bante Maria Boncompagni-Ludovisi)
* Andrew (married Caroline Mulroney, only daughter of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney)
* Winston

Lapham, previously living on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, moved to Rome at the start of 2024. He died there on July 23, 2024, at the age of 89.

<text>Brian John Peter Ferneyhough (; born 16 January 1943) is an English composer. Ferneyhough is typically considered the central figure of the New Complexity movement. Ferneyhough has taught composition at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg and the University of California, San Diego; he teaches at Stanford University and is a regular lecturer in the summer courses at Darmstädter Ferienkurse. He has resided in California since 1987.

==Life==
Ferneyhough was born in Coventry and received formal musical training at the Birmingham School of Music and the Royal Academy of Music from 1966 to 1967, where he studied with Lennox Berkeley. Ferneyhough was awarded the Mendelssohn Scholarship in 1968 and moved to mainland Europe to study with Ton de Leeuw in Amsterdam, and later with Klaus Huber in Basel.

Between 1973 and 1986 he taught composition at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg, Germany, where his students included Toshio Hosokawa, Joël-François Durand, Roger Redgate, Alessandro Melchiorre, Giulio Castagnoli, Kaija Saariaho, Joël Bons (winner of the 2021 Grawemeyer Award), Hans-Ola Ericsson, and Rodney Sharman.

The Royan Festival of 1974 saw the premiere of &quot;Cassandra&#x27;s Dream Song&quot;, the first of several pieces for solo flute, as well as &quot;Missa Brevis&quot;, written for 12 singers. In 1975, performances of his work for large ensemble &quot;Transit&quot; and &quot;Time and Motion Study III&quot; were given; the former piece being awarded a Koussevitzky Prize, the latter performed at the Donaueschingen festival. In many of these events he was paired with fellow British composer, Michael Finnissy, with whom he became friends during his student days. In 1984 he was given the title Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

Between 1987 and 1999 he was Professor of Music at the University of California, San Diego. His graduate students at UCSD included composers Chaya Czernowin and Mark Applebaum, among many others. In 2000, he became William H. Bonsall Professor in Music at Stanford University. For the 2007–08 academic year, he was visiting professor at the Harvard University Department of Music. Between 1978 and 1994 Ferneyhough was a composition lecturer at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse and, since 1990, has directed an annual mastercourse at the Fondation Royaumont in France.

In 2007, Ferneyhough received the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize for lifetime achievement. In 2009 he was appointed foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.
In 2012 he was awarded an honorary DMus from Goldsmiths, University of London.
In December 2018 he received an honorary degree from the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire for his contribution to contemporary classical music.

==Style and technique==
Ferneyhough&#x27;s initial forays into composition were met with little sympathy in England. His submission of &quot;Coloratura&quot; to the Society for the Promotion of New Music in 1966 was returned, with a suggestion that the oboe part should be scored for clarinet. Whilst Ferneyhough did find it hard, one source of support came from Hans Swarsenski who saw the same thing happen to Cornelius Cardew; Cardew enjoyed a prestigious continental reputation, but a poor one in his homeland. Swarsenski said of Ferneyhough: &#x27;I&#x27;ve taken on an English composer who is I think is enormously talented. If this doesn&#x27;t work, this is the last time&#x27;. Ferneyhough continued to struggle, but the aforementioned Royan festival marked a breakthrough for Ferneyhough&#x27;s career.

From here, Ferneyhough became closely associated with the so-called New Complexity school of composition (indeed, he is often referred to as the &quot;Father of New Complexity&quot;), characterized by its extension of the modernist tendency towards formalization (particularly as in integral serialism). Ferneyhough&#x27;s actual compositional approach, however, rejects serialism and other &quot;generative&quot; methods of composing; he prefers instead to use systems only to create material and formal constraints, while their realisation appears to be more spontaneous.

Ferneyhough has been interested in challenging listeners’ ways of absorbing musical information flow, prompting new kinds of temporal awareness by being presented with musical materials (events, objects, gestures, rhythms, textures) that contain their own sufficient complexity:

The more the internal integrity of a musical event suggests its autonomy, the less the capacity of the &quot;time arrow&quot; to traverse it with impunity; it is &quot;bent&quot; by the contact. By the same token, however, the impact of the time vector &quot;damages&quot; the event-object, thus forcing it to reveal its own generative history, the texturation of its successivity: its perceptual potential has been redefined by the collision. As the piece progresses we are continually stumbling across further stages in this catastrophic obstacle race. The energy accumulation and expenditure across and between these confrontational moments is perceived as a form of internalized metronome, and in fact it is a version of this procedure which most clearly fuels the expressive world of &quot;Mnemosyne&quot;: the retardational and catastrophic timeline modifiers are employed equally to focus temporal awareness through the lens of material.

His scores make huge technical demands on performers. The compositions have, however, attracted a number of advocates, among them the Arditti Quartet, ELISION Ensemble, the members of the Nieuw Ensemble, Ensemble Contrechamps, Ensemble Exposé, Armand Angster, James Avery, , Arne DeForce, Mats Scheidegger, , Nicolas Hodges, Mark Knoop, Geoffrey Morris, Ian Pace, Carl Rosman, Harry Sparnaay, and EXAUDI Vocal Ensemble.

His opera, &quot;Shadowtime&quot;, with a libretto by Charles Bernstein, and based on the life of the German philosopher Walter Benjamin, was premiered in Munich on 25 May 2004, and recorded in 2005 for CD release in 2006. As is usual for Ferneyhough&#x27;s works, the opera received mixed reviews.

==Reception==

Ferneyhough has been called &quot;the most controversial composer of his generation&quot;. &quot;In the same year [1974], the performance of several of his works at the Royan Festival established Ferneyhough as one of the most brilliant and controversial figures of a new generation of composers&quot;. &quot;Brian Ferneyhough may well be one of the most important composers to emerge from the latter half of this century. Simultaneously famous and infamous, he is a controversial figure of world renown, bent on making the most out of music.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Tom Service called &quot;La Terre est un Homme&quot; &quot;one of the most significant achievements in late 20th-century orchestral writing&quot;, and also recommended the &quot;Carceri d&#x27;Invenzione&quot; pieces, &quot;Lemma-Icon-Epigram&quot;, &quot;Terrain&quot;, and the string quartets.

<text>Sulu (), officially the Province of Sulu (Tausūg: &quot;Wilāya sin Lupa&#x27; Sūg&quot;; ), is a province of the Philippines in the Sulu Archipelago.

It was part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), until the Supreme Court of the Philippines on September 9, 2024 declared its inclusion to be unconstitutional because of the province&#x27;s simple majority vote against it during the 2019 Bangsamoro autonomy plebiscite.

Its capital is Jolo on the island of the same name. Maimbung, the royal capital of the Sultanate of Sulu, is also located in the province. Sulu is along the southern border of the Sulu Sea and the northern boundary of the Celebes Sea.

Out of all 82 provinces in the Philippines, it is the poorest, as evidenced by it having the highest poverty rate. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, poverty incidence in Sulu had reduced in 2021 with 51 percent compared to 75.3 percent in 2018. According to the PSA, this reduction in poverty incidence is an improvement for the province.

==History==
===Early history===
Prior to the arrival of Islam in Sulu, the province used to adhere to local animist religions; this later changed to Hindu and Buddhist belief systems. Throughout this time, the Kingdom of Lupah Sug had been established centuries before Islam arrived.

The advent of Islam around 1138 through merchants and traders had a distinct influence on Southeast Asia. The coming of Arabs, Persians and other Muslims paved the way for the arrival of religious missionaries, traders, scholars and travelers to Sulu and Mindanao in the 12th century.

A landmark born of the social process was the founding of the Sultanate of Sulu. Year 1380 CE, The Sunni Sufi Scholar Karim-ul Makhdum came to Sulu and introduced Islam to the Philippines. In 1450 CE, Johore-born Arab adventurer Sayyid Abubakar Abirin came to Sulu and lived with Rajah Baguinda Ali. The Sunni Sufi Teacher and Sayyid Abubakar eventually married Ali&#x27;s daughter, Dayang-dayang Paramisuli, and inherited Rajah Baguinda&#x27;s polity (which was a principality before), which he turned into the Sultanate of Sulu and become its first Sultan. To consolidate his rule, Sayyid Abubakar united the local political units under the umbrella of the Sultanate. A Sultanate that followed the Ash&#x27;ari Aqeeda, Shafi&#x27;i Madh&#x27;hab and Sufism. He brought Sulu, Zamboanga Peninsula, Palawan, and Basilan under its aegis.

===Spanish colonial era===

The navigational error that landed Ferdinand Magellan in Limasawa brought awareness of Europe to the Philippines and opened the door to Spanish colonial incursion. The Spaniards introduced Christianity and a political system of church-state dichotomy, which encountered fierce resistance in the devastating Moro wars from 1578 to 1899. The Sultanate of Sulu formally recognised Spanish sovereignty in Tawi-Tawi and Sulu in middle of the 19th century, but these areas remained partially ruled by the Spanish as their sovereignty was limited to military stations, garrisons, and pockets of civilian settlements, until they had to abandon the region as a consequence of their defeat in the Spanish–American War.

===American era===

After Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States, American forces came to Jolo and ended the 23 years of Spanish military occupation (1876 to 1899). On August 20, Sultan Jamalul Kiram II and Brig. Gen. John C. Bates signed the Bates Agreement that continued the gradual emasculation of the Sultanate started by Spain (Treaty of 1878) until March 1915 when the Sultan abdicated his temporal powers in the Carpenter Agreement. The Agreement eliminated opposition to the civilian government of Gov. Clinton Solidum.


The Department of Mindanao and Sulu under Gov. Carpenter was created by &quot;Philippine Commission Act 2309&quot; (1914) and ended on February 5, 1920, by Act of Philippine Legislature No. 2878. The Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes was organized and briefly headed by Teofisto Guingona Sr. With the enactment by the US Congress of the Jones Law (Philippine Autonomy Law) in 1916, ultimate Philippine independence was guaranteed and the Filipinization of public administration began. Sulu, however, had an appointed American governor until 1935, and the Governor General in Manila had a say in Sulu affairs.

At any rate, the essence of local governance forged by Rajah Baguinda continued to permeate the ethos of Sulu politics despite centuries of colonial presence. History points to a local government in Sulu that antedates other similar systems in the country.

The province hosted the Daru Jambangan (Palace of Flowers) which was the royal palace of the Sultan of Sulu since historical times. The palace, located in Maimbung was made of wood, and was destroyed in 1932 by a huge storm.

===Japanese occupation===
During the brief Japanese occupation years, Sulu was bombed by the Japanese and was conquered afterwards. The Japanese were eventually expelled by the Americans and the natives of Sulu, and the Americans started to push for the independence of the Philippines as &#x27;one country&#x27;. This prompted various leaders from Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago to campaign against being lumped with the Catholic natives of Luzon and the Visayas. Despite the campaign against the &#x27;one Philippines model&#x27;, the United States granted independence to the Philippines, effectively giving control of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago to the Filipino government in Manila.

It was during this period that the fighting 21 of Sulu rose with Lt. Abdulrahim Imao and Sayyid Captain Kalingalan Caluang who distinguished himself through extraordinary valor and leadership, earning widespread recognition and commendation. The Fighting 21 of Sulu was narrated by Ernesto M. Espaldon in his book. Among Sayyid Captain Kalingalan Caluang&#x27;s notable accolades was the prestigious Bronze Star Medal, awarded on February 4, 1944, under Executive Order №9419 by the Commanding General of the 41st Infantry Division, for his meritorious achievements in the Sulu Archipelago, Philippine Islands. His exceptional acts of leadership, strategic resourcefulness, and decisive initiative during pivotal moments were highly praised. Despite facing harsh conditions and relentless enemy engagement, Captain Caluang demonstrated unwavering courage, sound judgment, and a steadfast commitment to duty.

===Philippine independence===
At the beginning of Philippine independence era, the reconstruction of the Daru Jambangan continued to be of huge importance to the people of Sulu as only a few arches and posts remain from the once grand palace complex. Many members of the royal family advocated for the reconstruction of the palace, however, the government of the Philippines made no official position or fund for the matter. During that time, the Mindanao sentiment to become a free country on its own was also felt in Sulu.

In 1948, Hadji Kamlon, a World War II veteran, started an uprising on Luuk, Sulu. He surrendered in 1949 but started another uprising in 1952. He then surrendered on July 31, 1952, to Secretary of Defense Ramon Magsaysay. However, he started a third uprising a week later. He surrendered again on November 9, 1952, but would start another uprising in early 1953. He would then surrender on August 11, 1953, after an encounter with Philippines Government troops. He violated the terms of his surrender a week later. Two years later, on September 24, 1955, he would then surrender after an encounter with government troops in Tandu Panuan, Luuk.

In 1973, the municipalities of South Ubian, Tandubas, Simunul, Sitangkai, Balimbing (Panglima Sugala), Bungao, Cagayan de Sulu (Mapun), and Turtle Island were transferred from the jurisdiction of Sulu to the newly formed province of Tawi-Tawi pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 302 of September 11, 1973.

====The Marcos Administration====
During Marcos era, Sulu was one of the provinces that fought back against Ferdinand Marcos as his regime tortured, killed, and exterminated hundreds of Moros. When news broke out regarding the planned invasion of eastern Sabah, Marcos ordered the military to massacre Tausug warriors, which led to the brutal 1968 Jabidah massacre, the worst human rights violation against the natives of Sulu.

News about the Jabidah Massacre led to the rise of numerous separatist movements in Mindanao, including Sulu, eventually leading to groups engaging in armed conflict with the Philippine government. One of the most destructive clashes, the 1974 Battle of Jolo, was so destructive that it was estimated to have rendered 40,000 people homeless in Jolo, the capital of Sulu.

The Sultan of Sulu, members of the royal family, and the leaders of Sulu were in favor of the People Power Revolution in Manila that successfully toppled the dictatorship and restored democracy in the country.

===Contemporary===
In 1989, the province of Sulu became part of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao or ARMM. A peace pact between the Moro National Liberation Front or MNLF and the Philippine government was also made. The founder and leader of the MNLF, Nur Misuari, who was a native of Sulu and adhered to the Sultanate of Sulu, became the governor of the entire ARMM from 1996 to 2001.

In 2016, a small replica of Daru Jambangan was built in the neighboring town of Talipao and became a centerpiece for a &#x27;vacation park&#x27;. The replica was about 25% of the actual size of the real Daru Jambangan during its heyday. A campaign to restore the Daru Jambangan in its original location in Maimbung is still ongoing. The National Commission for Culture and the Arts and the National Museum of the Philippines were tasked to faithfully restore or reconstruct the Daru Jambangan in Maimbung.

In 2019, the Bangsamoro autonomy plebiscite led to the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) creating the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) to replace the ARMM. The initiative lost by a 54.3% margin in Sulu, but was carried nonetheless because the votes of the entire ARMM were counted as one. However in September 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that Sulu should have not been made part of Bangsamoro. The status of which administrative region Sulu belongs to is unclear although the Commission on Elections &quot;en banc&quot; had the consensus that Sulu should revert back to the Zamboanga Peninsula, the region it belonged to prior its inclusion in the ARMM back in 1989. It was also proposed that Sulu become a &quot;pilot province&quot; under the Office of the President. Sulu&#x27;s exclusion was challenged but Supreme Court ruled in finality its decision on November 26, 2024.

==Geography==

The province covers an area of . Sulu&#x27;s main island, Jolo, has an area of , making it the 16th largest island of the Philippine Archipelago by area.

Sulu is a part of the Sulu Archipelago, which stretches from the tip of the Zamboanga Peninsula on the north to the island of Borneo in the south. The main island and its islets are situated between the island-provinces of Basilan to the northeast, and Tawi-Tawi to the southwest. Sulu is bordered by two seas; the Sulu Sea to the north, and the Celebes Sea to its south. Sulu has over 157 islets, some of which remain unnamed.

The islands are organized into four groups:
* Jolo group
* Pangutaran group
* Tongkil-Banguingui (Samales) group
* Siasi-Tapul group

===Administrative divisions===
Sulu comprises 19 municipalities that are organized into two legislative districts and further subdivided into 410 barangays.

 

==Demographics==
The population of Sulu in the 2020 census was 1,000,108 people, with a density of .

Although consisting of a mixed community of Muslims, the Tausugs dominate the Sulu Archipelago. The Tausug were among the first inhabitants of the Philippines to embrace Islam as a religion and a way of life. They are referred to as &#x27;people of the current&#x27;, reflective of their close ties to the sea.

===Religion===
Sulu inhabitants are predominantly Muslim, constituting about 99% of the provincial population in 2015.

A majority of Sulu&#x27;s Muslim population practice Sunni Islam of the Shafi&#x27;i tradition, as taught by Arab, Persian, Indian Muslim, Chinese Muslim and Malaccan missionaries from the 14th Century onwards.

Relatively newer Islamic sects, mostly brought by returning veterans of the Afghan wars and missionaries from Pakistan&#x27;s stricter Sufi traditions, referred to as the Tableegh, have been active in propagating what they believe to be a &quot;purer&quot; Islamic way of life and worship. A very small number who have since married into Iranian or Iraqi families have converted to Shiite Islam.

The majority of Sulu Christians are Catholics. They are under the jurisdiction of Archdiocese of Zamboanga through its suffragan Apostolic Vicariate of Jolo. Non-Catholic Christians include Evangelicals, Jesus Miracle Crusade, Episcopalian, Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and a number of other Protestant denominations. Only the most recent Chinese immigrants adhere to Buddhism or Taoism, while most of the older Chinese families have acculturated and have either converted to Christianity or Islam while retaining many of their Chinese beliefs.

===Languages===
The Tausug language is the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Sulu. The other local language is the indigenous Sama, which is widely used in varied tones and accents. This variety led to the development of Sinama dialects. The major ones are Sinama Sibutu (spoken mainly in the Sibutu-Sitangkai Region), Sinama Simunul (concentrated in Simunul-Manuk-Mangkaw Islands), Sinama Kapoan (spoken in the South Ubian-Tandubas and Sapa-Sapa Regions) and Sinama Banguingui (concentrated in Buan Island and spoken by Banguingui people).

The Bajau-Sama language is also spoken, as are the official languages of Filipino and English. Many locals and barter traders can speak Sabah Malay, while Chavacano is also spoken by Christian and Muslim locals who maintain contacts and trade with the mainland Zamboanga Peninsula and Basilan.

==Economy==

Sulu is predominantly agricultural with farming and fishing as its main livelihood activities. Its fertile soil and ideal climate can grow a variety of crops such as abaca, coconuts, Sulu coffee, oranges, and lanzones as well as exotic fruits seldom found elsewhere in the country such as durian and mangosteen.

Fishing is the most important industry since the Sulu Sea is one of the richest fishing grounds in the country. The province also has an extensive pearl industry, with a pearl farm on Marungas Island. The backs of sea turtles are made into beautiful trays and combs. During breaks from fishing, the people build boats and weave mats. Other industries include coffee processing and fruit preservation.

The handicrafts of Sulu have both Islamic and Malay influences. Skilled artisans make boats, bladed weapons, bronze and brassware, pis cloth, embroidered textiles, shellcraft, traditional house carvings, and carved wooden grave markers.

The province used to be one of the most prosperous in the southern Philippines. However, due to conflicts, terrorism, and the establishment of jihadists groups following Wahhabism such as the Abu Sayyaf, the province&#x27;s economy has suffered badly and has been reduced to its current state.
==Transportation==
After the success of new flight of Philippine Airlines inside Bangsamoro region, the government is already looking forward to open the route to Cotabato City. As of to date Gove
Leading Edge, Cebu Pacific Cebgo and Platinum Skies from Zamboanga are existing operational flight utilizing the newly renovated Jolo Airport.

<text>Tawi-Tawi, officially the Province of Tawi-Tawi (Tausug: &quot;Wilaya&#x27; sin Tawi-Tawi&quot;; Sinama: &quot;Jawi Jawi/Jauih Jauih&quot;; ), is an island province in the Philippines located in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). The capital of Tawi-Tawi is Bongao.

It is the southernmost province of the country, sharing sea borders with the Malaysian state of Sabah and the Indonesian North Kalimantan province, both on the island of Borneo to the west. To the northeast lies the province of Sulu. Tawi-Tawi also covers some islands in the Sulu Sea to the northwest, Cagayan de Tawi-Tawi Island and the Turtle Islands, just away from Sabah.

The municipalities comprising the current Tawi-Tawi province were formerly under the jurisdiction of Sulu until 1973.

== Etymology ==
The province was named after its main island, which at 580.5 km2 (224.1 sq mi) accounts for a little more than half the province&#x27;s 1,087.40 km2 (419.85 sq mi) land area. Tawi-Tawi is the Sinama form of &quot;jawi-jawi&quot;, Malay for the banyan tree; the island is known for having an abundance of this tree. Early Spanish accounts give the name of the island as &quot;Tauitaui&quot; and &quot;Tavi-Tavi&quot; or &quot;Tavitavi&quot;.

== History ==

===Early history===
Evidence of human presence in Tawi-tawi was carbon-dated to be 6,810 BC to 3,190 B.C., signifying one of the earliest known evidence of human presence in Southeast Asia. The bones, jars, shells, and other artifacts and fossils were found in the &quot;Bolobok Rock Shelter Cave Archaeological Site&quot;, which has been declared as an Important Cultural Treasure by the government in 2017.

Much of the Tawi-tawi area was the center of Sama culture and arts for hundreds of years. Some islands are sites of centuries-old traditional burial grounds featuring traditional Sama &quot;okil&quot; carvings of ancestors.

In 1380, the first mosque in the Philippines, the Sheik Karimol Makhdum Mosque, was established by an Arab trader and missionary, Makhdum Karim. The area was heavily converted to Islam, especially when the Sultanate of Sulu in nearby Sulu province was founded. Although unlike the Tausug people, many Sama retained at least part of their ancient animist religions.

===Spanish colonial era===
As early as January 28, 1761, Sultan Muizz ud-Din entered into an agreement with Alexander Dalrymple of the British East India Company for commercial and economic concessions. The subsequent treaties with Muizz ud-Din on September 12, 1762, and with Sultan Azim ud-Din, claimant to the Sultanate and a prisoner of the British in Manila, on February 23, 1763, confirmed these British claims. However, on March 5, 1775, Datu Teteng annihilated the British troops in Balambangan. Since then, the Muslims not only fought the British soldiers but also the Spanish troops. After the brother of Sultan Aliyud-Din I captured the Spanish ship San Jose in Tawi-Tawi, the British forces withdrew from Balambangan in 1805.

On January 22, 1878, Baron von Overbeck, representing the British North Borneo Company, signed a treaty with Sultan Jamalul Alam for the lease of the Sultan&#x27;s land in Borneo at an annual rent of 5,000 Mexican dollars. The Germans also asked for commercial concessions. Due to foreign encroachments, the Spaniards constructed a naval base at Tata&#x27;an and built garrisons in Bongao and Siasi.

On March 7, 1885, Spain, Britain and Germany signed a protocol in Madrid whereby Spain relinquished all her claims to the offshore lands in Borneo, granted freedom of trade and navigation in Sulu, and Britain and Germany recognized Spanish sovereignty over Balabac and Cagayan de Sulu. However, the British diplomatically continued to pay the annual rents for Sabah (Sultan&#x27;s land in Borneo) to Harun ar-Rashid.

During the Philippine Revolution of 1896, the mutiny of the 68th Regiment at Busbus, Jolo implicated Tagalog soldiers. The Muslims, however, retained their own views on independence and freedom.

===American invasion era===
When the American forces occupied Jolo on May 19, 1899, they established garrisons at Bongao and Siasi after the Muslims wiped out the Spanish garrison in Tata&#x27;an, Tawi-Tawi. In 1900, the United States entered into a treaty with Spain whereby Sibutu and Cagayan de Sulu were ceded to the former for $100,000. The Sultanate continued to receive the rentals for Sabah until 1946 when the British North Borneo Company sold its rights to the British Crown.

===Japanese occupation era===
During World War II, the calm but exposed waters around the islands were used by the Imperial Japanese Navy as a major fleet anchorage due to its proximity to the oilfields of Borneo. Japanese forces, however, did not develop any facilities on the islands leaving the anchorage without an airfield, which allowed American submarines to track the movements of the Japanese fleet at the exposed anchorage. After the Japanese Imperial Forces occupied Tawi-Tawi, guerilla forces were organized under Lts. Konglamtio and Alejandro Tresperes in Siasi and Tawi-Tawi. These units were under the Sulu Command led by Lt. Col. Alejandro Suarez. The Command aided the American Liberation Forces at Sanga-Sanga Island on April 2, 1945.

On October 16, 1947, the offshore lands of Borneo—Taganak, Bakkungan, Bayaua, Sibauang and Lihiman Islands—were turned over to the Philippines by the British North Borneo government. The unveiling ceremonies of the marker in Taganak Island on June 26, 1948, were attended by M.G. Combe, representing Great Britain, former President Diosdado Macapagal for the Philippines, Princess Tarhata Kiram for the Sultanate, and Governor Kalingalan Caluang for Sulu.

=== Philippine Independence ===
====Foundation====
Previously part of the province of Sulu, Tawi-Tawi was converted into a province on September 11, 1973, pursuant to &quot;Presidential Decree No. 302&quot; and erstwhile Commodore Romulo Espaldon was appointed as its first governor until the first provincial elections were held.

Prior to issuing the decree, President Marcos had asked Espaldon, “Why are the young boys of Tawi-Tawi easily wooed by the Moro National Liberation Front?” Espaldon replied, “The Sama boys, like their elders and leaders, are tired and weary of their union with the Province of Sulu. They want to have their own leaders and manage their own affairs. If His Excellency wants to solve the problem, I recommend that he create them into a separate province and allow them to exercise their own local prerogatives.” Hence, Espaldon earned the moniker &quot;Father of Tawi-Tawi.&quot;

During the first 730 days of Tawi-Tawi as a province, Espaldon spearheaded over 100 civilian infrastructure projects, including the construction of the provincial capitol, provincial hospital, public market, 50 mosques, school houses, radio station, airstrips, piers, houses, bridges, roads and water system.

The seat of the provincial government was initially designated as Bato-Bato in the municipality of Balimbing (now Panglima Sugala), but was moved to Bongao on April 4, 1979, by virtue of &quot;Batas Pambansa Blg. 24&quot;.

===Contemporary===
Tawi-Tawi is currently being groomed as the location of a special economic zone and transhipment point, a future center of commerce as the Tawi-Tawi freeport is being built in the area.

==Geography==

The province lies at the southwestern tip of the country, situated between the Sulu Sea in the north and the Celebes Sea in the south. The province is part of the Sulu Archipelago, and consists of Tawitawi Island and 106 surrounding islands and islets with a combined land area of . Tawitawi Island itself has an area of . The last island of the province at the edge of the Philippine-Malaysia border is Panguan Island.

The province has two seasons: dry and wet. The climate is generally moderate. The wettest months are from August to November. The other months of the year are generally dry with occasional rain showers.

===Biogeography===
The main island of Tawi-Tawi supports many endemic species and subspecies of vertebrates, invertebrates and plants unique to this island, plus some that are only shared with Sulu Province. These include the Tawitawi brown dove, the Sulu hornbill and the Sulu bleeding-heart, although this latter species may already be extinct.

The rapid expansion of human settlements into forested areas together with clearance for agriculture in the last few decades has dramatically reduced the available habitat for most of the endemic species, many of which are now considered &#x27;Critically Endangered&#x27; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

===Administrative divisions===

Tawi-Tawi comprises 11 municipalities, all encompassed by two legislative districts and further subdivided into 203 barangays.

* Bongao — the capital of the province
* Languyan — created by President Marcos for rebel leader Hadjiril Matba who joined the government in the 1970s
* Mapun — Tawi-Tawi&#x27;s northernmost municipality, formerly &quot;Cagayan de Tawi-Tawi&quot; or &quot;Cagayan de Sulu&quot;
* Panglima Sugala — formerly known as &quot;Balimbing&quot;. However, in the EDSA Revolution, the word &quot;balimbing&quot; acquired a derogatory meaning associated with turncoatism due to the fruit&#x27;s many sides. It is the former capital of the province.
* Sapa-Sapa
* Sibutu — home to the descendants of Malay royalty in Borneo and not necessarily associated with the Sulu royalty and home to Saluag Island (Sikulan), the southernmost island in the country
* Simunul — site of oldest mosque in the Philippines and home of Sheikh Makdum, one of the early pioneers spreading Islam in the country
* Sitangkai — southernmost municipality in the country.
* South Ubian
* Tandubas
* Turtle Islands — a turtle sanctuary and protected area

Most of the municipalities are located on the islands in the Sulu Archipelago. Two of them, Mapun (which is closer to Palawan) and Turtle Islands, lie within the Sulu Sea.



==Demographics==
The population of Tawi-Tawi in the 2020 census was 440,276 people, with a density of .

===Inhabitants===
Most of the people in Tawi-Tawi belong to the Sama cultural group. Within this group are subgroups and named based on the location of the speaker. Sama Sibutu are those from the Sibutu-Sitangkai Island Group, Sama Simunul are those from Simunul-Manuk Mangkaw Island Group, and so on.

The Jama Mapun are largely found in the Cagayan Mapun and Turtle Island Group. Many of the people from the Turtle Islands and Cagayan Mapun maintain daily commerce with Sabah, since it is only 14 kilometers away.

The Badjao (also called &quot;Sama Dilaut&quot;) are widely dispersed across the province, though their population is diminishing due to diseases and migration to other areas in the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.

The Tausog or Tau Sug, Orang Suluk or Aa Suk are a Moro ethnic group constituting a significant minority in Tawi-Tawi.

=== Language ===
The Tausug language is the lingua franca of Tawi-Tawi, as in the case of the rest of the provinces in the Sulu Archipelago. Another prevailing local language, Sama, is spoken in varied tones and accents with the major ones being Sinama Sibutu (spoken mainly in the Sibutu-Sitangkai Region), Sinama Simunul (concentrated in Simunul-Manuk-Mangkaw Islands), Sinama Kapoan (spoken in the South Ubian-Tandubas and Sapa-Sapa Regions) and Sinama Banguingui (concentrated in Buan Island and spoken by Banguingui people).

Chavacano, Cebuano, and Yakan are also spoken, as are the official languages of Filipino and English. Many locals and barter traders can also speak Sabah Malay. 
Many can also speak Cebuano because of the mass influx of Visayan settlers to Mindanao, since Tausug is a related Visayan language.

===Religion===
Almost all (99%) of the population of Tawi-Tawi is Muslim, with a minority of Christians (0.7%).

A majority of Tawi-Tawi&#x27;s Muslim population practice Sunni Islam of the Shafi&#x27;i tradition, as taught by Arab, Persian, Indian Muslim, Chinese Muslim and Malaccan missionaries from the 14th century onwards. The oldest mosque in the Philippines, the Sheik Karimol Makdum Mosque, can be found in Simunul, Tawi-Tawi.

Relatively newer Islamic sects, mostly brought by returning veterans of the Afghan wars and missionaries from Pakistan&#x27;s stricter Sufi traditions, referred to as the Tableegh, have been active in propagating what they believe to be a &quot;purer&quot; Islamic way of life and worship. A very small number who have since married into Iranian or Iraqi families have converted to Shiite Islam.

Majority of Tawi-Tawi Christians are Roman Catholic, they are under the jurisdiction of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zamboanga through its suffragan Apostolic Vicariate of Jolo/Diocese of Jolo. Non-Catholic Christians include Evangelicals, Jesus Miracle Crusade, Episcopalian, and Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and a number of other Protestant denominations. Only the most recent Chinese immigrants adhere to Buddhism or Taoism, while most of the older Chinese families have acculturated and have either converted to Islam while retaining most of their Chinese beliefs.

==Economy==
Agriculture, fishing, and agar-agar (seaweeds) farming are the leading source of livelihood of the people of Tawi-Tawi, with quite a number engaged in the barter trade business. Copra is the top agricultural product, followed by root crops, fruits, and vegetables.

==Transportation==
Sanga-Sanga Airport, the main airport of the province, is located in the municipality of Bongao.

Recently, Philippine Airlines and Bangsamoro Government launches the inaugural flight of the first ever regional air connectivity on June 9, 2022, from Cotabato City, the regions seat and capital. Meanwhile, Cebu Pacific began operating a daily flight from Zamboanga City to Tawi-Tawi Province on October 14, 2011, utilizing its 150-seater Airbus A319 aircraft. Philippine Airlines (operated by PAL Express) also started operating flights to and from Zamboanga City on December 15, 2019.

A sea connection to other parts of the Philippine archipelago as well as an international route to Semporna, Malaysia is available from Bongao.

<doc id="297098" wikidata="Q1416338" url="?curid=297098" title="Creatures (video game series)">
<text>Creatures is an artificial life video game series created in the mid-1990s by English computer scientist Steve Grand while working for the Cambridge video game developer Millennium Interactive.

The gameplay focuses on raising alien creatures known as Norns, teaching them to survive, helping them explore their world, defending them against other species, and breeding them. Words can be taught to the creatures by a learning computer (for verbs) or by repeating the name of the object while the creature looks at it. Once a creature understands language, the player can instruct their creature by typing in instructions, which the creature can choose to obey.

A complete life cycle is modeled for the creatures - childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and senescence, each with its own unique needs. The gameplay is designed to foster an emotional bond between the player and their creatures. Rather than taking a scripted approach, the games in the &quot;Creatures&quot; series were driven by detailed biological and neurological simulation and its unexpected results.

There have been six major &quot;Creatures&quot; releases from Creature Labs: between 1996 and 2001 there were three main games, the &quot;Docking Station&quot; add-on (generally referred to as a separate game) and two children&#x27;s games, and there were three games created for console systems.

==Overview==
The program was one of the first commercial titles to code artificial life organisms from the genetic level upwards using a sophisticated biochemistry and neural network brains, including simulated senses of sight, hearing and touch. This meant that the Norns and their DNA could develop and &quot;evolve&quot; in increasingly diverse ways, unpredicted by the makers. By breeding certain Norns with others, some traits could be passed on to following generations. The Norns turned out to behave similarly to living creatures. Norns respond to external stimuli, such as interaction with the player, and internal stimuli, such as changes in chemical concentrations or neural activities. Sight is simulated by having a group of neurons representing each type of object in the world. When an object belonging to this type is in front of the creature (&#x27;within eyesight&#x27;), the neuron becomes active and the creature can &#x27;see&#x27; the object. The Norns possess simulated biological drives which give punishment when they are raised, and reward when they are lowered. The model for Norns&#x27; decision-making process is behaviorist and based on Norns learning how to reduce their drives. Dickinson and Balleine state that while this stimulus-response/reinforcement process makes the creatures seem like they are goal-directed, they are instead &#x27;habit machines&#x27; responding in a learned fashion to particular stimuli.

Mutations in the genome can occur, allowing new characteristics to appear in the population and potentially be inherited by a future generation. Because the Norns have a lifespan of roughly 40 hours, users could observe the changes that occur over a large number of generations. Faulty genomes can also occur - for example, Norns which cannot see or hear, creatures which are either missing organs or have surplus organs, or immortal Norns due to a hyper-efficient digestion system. Creatures used the emergent approach seen in animats, but with the goal of more complex behaviours than locomotion. Grand describes the psychological model of the creatures as being inspired by rats. In 2000, Grand described the intelligence level of Norns as being like ants. Margaret Boden, in 2003, rejected &quot;Creatures&quot; as being a form of alien life as the simulated metabolism is concerned with controlling the Norn&#x27;s behaviour, not on maintaining its &#x27;physical&#x27; form. In 2011, Grand stated that while the Norns in &quot;Creatures&quot; could learn, generalise from past experiences to novel experiences, and react in an intelligent manner to stimuli, they could not think.

The genetics in &quot;Creatures&quot; are somewhat different from human genetics; they are haploid. There is no concept of dominant gene and recessive gene, much less recombination between loci. Nevertheless, the complexity of the simulated biochemistry meant that Norn behaviour was highly unpredictable.

Among the fans of &quot;Creatures&quot; were the Oxford zoologist Richard Dawkins, who called it a &quot;quantum leap in the development of artificial life&quot;, and author Douglas Adams. &quot;Creatures&quot; inspired some players to take up careers in the sciences.

==History==
Originally conceived as a desktop pet with a brain, Grand later incorporated inspiration from &quot;The Planiverse&quot; to pitch a &quot;little computer ewoks&quot; game, like the game &quot;Little Computer People&quot;. Grand wanted players to have a rapport with their creatures, feeling that he should make the creatures seem &quot;genuinely alive&quot; to the player, showing &quot;the &#x27;right&#x27; kind of behaviour&#x27; in a variety of circumstances. To create this kind of behaviour, Grand felt it was necessary to program the creatures by simulating the building blocks of nature in a bottom-up approach, allowing the complex behaviour to emerge, rather than using a rule-based system approach. Grand later wished to include references to an &quot;English&quot; or Norse mythology, to try to make the world more internally consistent, but found that the team wanted to make the game into a conventional adventure game. He later decided to scale back on the mythology aspects of the game, focusing instead on the artificial life point - eventually presenting the game as an artificial pet hobby, which provided some of the impetus to include genetics in the creatures.
&quot;Creatures&quot; was developed as a consumer product by Millennium, and was released by Mindscape in 1996. The program was instantly successful, and an online community of players soon formed, swapping Norns, creating new objects for Albia, sharing tips on how to play the game and anecdotes about unexpected evolutionary changes that they had seen, and even creating new breeds of Norn. At one point, the &quot;Creatures&quot; online community was the largest of its type.

In 1996, &quot;Creatures&quot; won an EMMA Award. Based on sales of 500,000 copies of &quot;Creatures&quot; from 1996 through to the second quarter of 1998, it was estimated that at that time, there was a possible global population of up to five million norns.

Development of &quot;Creatures 2&quot; began in Q3 1997. In 1998, the video games division of Millennium was sold to Sony Entertainment while those working on alife and &quot;Creatures&quot; formed a new company called Cyberlife Technology. Along with continued work on the &quot;Creatures&quot; titles, the company did work for industry and the British Ministry of Defence, famously attempting to teach live organisms to fly virtual fighter jets. &quot;Creatures 2&quot; was nominated in the Artificial Intelligence category of the Game Developers Conference&#x27;s Spotlight Award.

In the late 1990s, Grand left Cyberlife to form Cyberlife Research and focus on the production of new alife technologies, including work on a robotic life form he called Lucy as well as writing books about his research. The remainder of the company was renamed Creature Labs, and focused on video game development.

Sequels to &quot;Creatures&quot;, including &quot;Creatures 2&quot;, &quot;Creatures 3&quot; and the small-children&#x27;s games &quot;Creatures Adventures&quot; and &quot;Creatures Playground&quot;, were released by Creature Labs in subsequent years. &quot;Creatures Adventures&quot; won an EMMA Award in 2000. &quot;Creatures Playground&quot; was exhibited at E3 and nominated for a BAFTA Award in 2000. The final major &quot;Creatures&quot; release, &quot;Docking Station&quot;, was made available for download from the company&#x27;s web site in 2001.

Development was suspended on future &quot;Creatures&quot; games on March 20, 2003, when Creature Labs ceased operations, but development and trademark rights have since been purchased by Gameware Development, Ltd. Gameware has revived the Creatures Developer Network, the shop, the forums, the &quot;Docking Station&quot; server, and has released many before-purchasable tools and add-ons for free.

Gameware staff that previously worked on &quot;Creatures&quot; developed a convergent media game for the BBC called &quot;BAMZOOKi&quot;.

In 2004, the &quot;Creatures&quot; games have been re-released in combination packs under the names &quot;Creatures: The Albian Years&quot; (C1, C2), &quot;Creatures Exodus&quot; (C3, DS) and &quot;Creatures Village&quot; (CA, CP). The Albian Years, and Exodus include the separate games, whereas Village has merged Adventures and Playground into a single game. At this time, it was estimated that there were thousands of &quot;Creatures&quot; players.

Kutoka Interactive, a Canadian children&#x27;s software company, has created releases of &quot;Creatures Exodus&quot; (Kutoka) and &quot;Creatures Village&quot; (Kutoka Kids) that are compatible with both Apple&#x27;s Mac OS X and Windows XP. They were released on 30 September 2005, and can be purchased either directly from Kutoka or from other online stores.

In November 2009, GOG.com announced that they were offering &quot;Creatures: The Albian Years&quot;, &quot;Creatures Exodus&quot; and &quot;Creatures Village&quot; for sale on their site as digital downloads. In 2011, &quot;Creatures 3: Raised in Space&quot;, a PlayStation One game, was re-released on the PlayStation Plus service.

In 2011, Fishing Cactus announced they were developing &quot;Creatures 4&quot;, to be demonstrated at that year&#x27;s Gamescom. A second demonstration was exhibited at Gamescom 2012. &quot;Creatures 4&quot; is Fishing Cactus&#x27;s most complex game to date. &quot;Creatures 4&quot; appeared at the 2012 Paris Games Week. In May 2013, Fishing Cactus announced that they and BigBen were partnering with ProSiebenSat.1 Games as a distributor, and that the name of the game would be changed from &quot;Creatures 4&quot; to &quot;Creatures Online&quot;. Another demo was shown at Gamescom 2013. Julien Hamaide, a developer of &quot;Creatures Online&quot;, presented about it at the Game/AI Conference 2014. In September 2015, Fishing Cactus halted the development of &quot;Creatures Online&quot;.

In 2016, Spil Games announced that they had bought the &quot;Creatures&quot; intellectual property from BigBen and were developing a free-to-play mobile game called &quot;Creatures Family&quot; to be released in 2017. In December 2021, Creatures 3, Docking Station, Creatures: The Albian Years and Creatures Village were released on the Steam games service.

==Games==
There were six major &quot;Creatures&quot; releases from Creature Labs. In addition to the three principal games, the &quot;Docking Station&quot; add-on (generally referenced as a separate game) and two children&#x27;s games were released.

===Main series (1996–2001)===
The original &quot;Creatures&quot; game, released in the United Kingdom and Australia in November 1996 and in North America in July 1997, took place on the fictional disc-shaped world Albia. While the &quot;faces&quot; of the disc were uninhabitable, the &quot;rim&quot; of Albia was home to a complicated environment much like Earth&#x27;s. Here lay an abandoned system of laboratories left over by the Shee, an advanced race that had suddenly left the planet many years earlier in order to find a more stable world. In these laboratories and environments, the player was able to hatch new Norns from leftover eggs and re-inhabit the world of Albia. According to Millenium, every copy of &quot;Creatures&quot; contains a unique starting set of eggs, whose genomes are not replicated on any other copy of the game. An expansion pack, called &quot;Life Kit #1&quot; was released for purchase later.&quot;Creatures 2&quot;, released on September 30, 1998, took place many years after the first game, after a devastating natural disaster (or, as explained in later games, a devastating Shee disaster) had changed the landscape of Albia dramatically and opened up new areas of the world. New technology and species were made available to the player, and the creatures themselves had been provided with &quot;considerably more sensory input, more actions they can take, and improved brain dynamics&quot;. Despite the great change in environment, including a &quot;complete working eco-system&quot;, the focus of the game remained the same. &quot;Creatures 2 Deluxe&quot; (with Life Kit) soon followed. 200,000 copies of &quot;Creatures 2&quot; were immediately shipped upon its release. Two expansion packs, Life Kit 1 and Life Kit 2, were released for C2. &quot;Creatures 2&quot; was considered &quot;much more difficult&quot; than &quot;C1&quot;, and the new, more challenging environment and norn biology was described as frustrating, but that after installing a new genome and going through successive generations, the Norns seemed smarter. Nick Walkland described the gameplay as a &quot;labour of love&quot;, noting that the challenge was to sustain your Norns&#x27; lives. Sid Fisk of Gamezilla criticized the audio for &quot;Creatures 2&quot; for not alerting him when his creature was near-death, but playing a &quot;funeral dirge&quot; as the body left the screen.

&quot;Creatures 3&quot;, released on November 4, 1999, took a detour from the first two games. It took place on the spaceship that the Shee had used to flee Albia. The ship was divided into many carefully controlled environments (Norn Terrarium, Jungle Terrarium, Desert Terrarium, Marine Terrarium). &quot;Creatures 3&quot; was much more technologically focused, including many agents which could be connected in various ways to perform tasks. Still, the goal was to experiment with the three principal species and create a living world out of an empty ship. &quot;Creatures 3&quot; included a &quot;new social element&quot;, by which norns could remember relationships they&#x27;d formed with other creatures.

The final major &quot;Creatures&quot; release was &quot;Docking Station&quot;, an Internet-based add-on to &quot;Creatures 3&quot;, released free of charge on the &quot;Creatures&quot; web site on March 27, 2001. It was intended as a way to sell &quot;Creatures 3&quot; (the player could dock the worlds of the two games together, hence the name &quot;&quot;Docking&quot; Station&quot;) and extra packs of Norn breeds. &quot;Docking Station&quot; has an intermittent reminder screen that encourages users to buy &quot;Creatures 3&quot;.

&quot;Docking Station&quot; added the possibility of interaction between individual player worlds; Norns could &#x27;travel&#x27; to other online worlds via a central server, players could chat to other online players, and it was possible to track Norns (and their offspring) that had been present in their worlds via the &quot;Docking Station&quot; website. While &quot;Docking Station&quot; was released late in the series&#x27; run, it changed gameplay (and the potential of the series) dramatically. One reviewer stated that it opened up a whole new world for her online. Another reviewer criticised the online portion of the game, as it requires the player to find online buddies. &quot;Docking Station&quot; also expanded considerably on the game mythos, including the introduction of an &#x27;anti-Shee&#x27;, the Banshee (a Grendel/Shee hybrid).

===Spin-offs===
====&quot;Creatures Adventures&quot;====
Released in 2000, and targeted at younger children (ages 6–9), &quot;Creatures Adventures&quot; dropped the complex interface of the main series in favour of brighter graphics and a more childlike atmosphere.

====&quot;Creatures Playground&quot;====
The second game in the younger children&#x27;s series, &quot;Creatures Playground&quot; (released the same year), could be connected to Adventures to create an even bigger world to explore. It has a theme park for the creatures, including mini-games like whack-a-mole.

====Console games====
The &quot;Creatures&quot; concept was made into three different games for consoles: &quot;Creatures&quot; for the Game Boy Advance and &quot;Creatures&quot; and &quot;&quot; for PlayStation. In the PlayStation games, the hand is replaced by a fairy named Scrubby. Because of the limited processing power of the early-day consoles, the AI had to be completely reprogrammed by the console development team around Volker Eloesser.

====Online games====
Prior to the cancellation of Creatures Family, Spil Games produced two free-to-play online creatures games, &quot;Creatures Alchemist&quot;, and &quot;Creatures: Color Craze&quot;. Unlike the main series, these games are not simulation games, but are instead puzzle games loosely based on the Creatures franchise.

===Cancelled games===
&quot;Creatures Project Loci&quot; was planned as a fully 3D, third-person Creatures game based on puzzle-solving and adventure, set on the fictional planet of Cruthiar. It was in development at the time of Creatures Labs&#x27; liquidation, but was canceled due to lack of funding. Loci would have been the first Creatures game for PS2, Xbox and GameCube.

&quot;Creatures Online&quot; was a planned sequel to the third Creatures game being developed by Fishing Cactus. The game was announced as &quot;Creatures 4&quot; in Fishing Cactus&#x27;s blog in May 2011. &quot;Creatures Online&quot; was to have 5 worlds, was to be completely in 3D instead of 2.5D pre-rendered graphics, and in-game currency was planned to buy Norns toys, food, etc. &quot;Creatures Online&quot; was designed to be a free-to-play game. A collector&#x27;s edition box was also announced with a Norn figurine, the three original games for current PCs, and the money paid for the game being usable as in-game money for Norns. &quot;Creatures 4&quot; entered an in-house alpha phase in March 2013. The internal systems of the creatures from &quot;C3/DS&quot; were retained and updated for the 3D environment. Norns&#x27; fur patterns were to be partially procedurally generated, with the goal of ensuring &quot;that no two Norns look alike&quot;. Heterochromia iridum was introduced. The norns of &quot;Creatures Online&quot; were to have a new drive, tentatively called &quot;altruism&quot;, which would have encouraged them to do things to benefit the norn colony, like tending to plants and fixing broken toys. &quot;Creatures 4&quot; was renamed &quot;Creatures Online&quot; in May 2013. &quot;Creatures Online&quot;, unlike earlier entries in the &quot;Creatures&quot; series, was to have a system of missions for the player to complete. &quot;Creatures Online&quot; was cancelled in November 2015 due to the loss of the license.

&quot;Creatures Family&quot; was in development by Spil Games, who acquired the Creatures license in 2016. It was intended as a successor to Creatures Online, with a target audience over 20 years old, but was quietly canceled for &quot;technical reasons&quot; sometime before August 2019.

==Later bundled releases==
There have been various re-releases of the &quot;Creatures&quot; games. The later re-releases from Gameware improved Windows XP compatibility by allowing them to run easily under non-administrator accounts and without the use of the compatibility mode, but break compatibility with some third-party content without the use of a third-party patch.

;&quot;Creatures Trilogy&quot; / &quot;Creatures Trilogy Gold Collection&quot;
This release of &quot;Creatures Trilogy&quot; included &quot;Creatures&quot;, &quot;Creatures 2&quot;, and &quot;Creatures 3&quot;, as well as the &quot;Life Kit&quot; addons for the earlier games. It was released before &quot;Docking Station&quot;, but the version of &quot;Creatures 3&quot; included in this was identical to the original release (except that it was using the newest patch) and was therefore compatible with &quot;Docking Station&quot;.

Encore Software released a &quot;Creatures Trilogy&quot; containing &quot;Creatures&quot;, &quot;Creatures 2&quot;, and &quot;Creatures 3&quot;, under their Encare line. They also released a &quot;gold&quot; version titled &quot;Creatures Trilogy Gold Collection&quot;.

;&quot;Creatures Internet Edition&quot; / &quot;Creatures Gold&quot;
The final major &quot;Creatures&quot; release was a re-release in 2001 by FastTrak Software Publishing as &quot;Creatures Internet Edition&quot;, a bundle of &quot;Creatures 3&quot;, &quot;Creatures 3 Update 2&quot;, &quot;Docking Station&quot;, and a number of environment extras and tools (many with multilingual variants). Linux Game Publishing released a Linux port of &quot;Creatures Internet Edition&quot; a few months later in December 2001.

The original &quot;Creatures Internet Edition&quot; was released again in 2002 by Focus Multimedia, without the physical manual, as &quot;Creatures Gold&quot;, but the disc contents were identical (and so the installer and PDF manual both referred to it as &quot;Creatures Internet Edition&quot;).

;&quot;Creatures: The Albian Years&quot;
&quot;Creatures 1&quot; and &quot;Creatures 2&quot; on one disk, updated to run on Windows XP.

;&quot;Creatures Exodus&quot;
&quot;Creatures 3&quot; and &quot;Docking Station&quot; plus a selection of new Norn breeds on one disk, updated for improved Windows XP compatibility. Mac OS X and Windows &amp; Mac dual-format, and free downloadable versions are also available.

;&quot;Creatures Village&quot;
&quot;Creatures Adventures&quot; and &quot;Creatures Playground&quot;, merged and updated for improved Windows XP compatibility. Mac OS X and Windows &amp; Mac dual-format versions are also available.

;&quot;Creatures Triple Collection&quot;
&quot;Creatures Triple Pack&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;Creatures Collection: Triple&quot;, contains &quot;The Albian Years&quot;, &quot;Creatures Exodus&quot; and &quot;Creatures Village&quot; for Windows.

==Gameplay==
Basic gameplay consists of hatching some creatures, usually norns, and guiding them to reach maturity and to breed more creatures, with the goal of a more intelligent future population. Words can be taught to creatures by a learning computer (for verbs) or by repeating the name of the object while the creature is looking at it. After a creature understands language, the player can instruct their creature by typing in instructions, which the creature may choose to obey - the player gets the impression that the norns can understand the player, but do not want to follow the player&#x27;s commands. The player cannot force creatures to do anything. Addressing individual creatures by their names, and issuing specific commands, such as &quot;Alice push toy&quot;, is recommended, as is following up with rewards if they obey: the player is represented by a disembodied hand in the world, and the hand can attempt to teach creatures by tickling them as a reward or punishing creatures by slapping them. (For &quot;Creatures Village&quot;, aimed at very young players, tickling is done by a feather wand, and punishment is represented by a squirt bottle.) Older norns can also teach concepts to younger norns. Norns may also express to the player how they are feeling. The language aspect was incorporated to promote a relationship between norns and players, allowing players to anthropomorphise their creatures. Players usually actively administer their worlds, adding in objects to help their creatures thrive. A complete life cycle is modelled for the creatures - childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and senescence, each with their own particular needs. Breeding is depicted in the game as &quot;a delicate affair&quot;, and is shown in the game by &quot;a long kissing sound followed by a pop&quot;. The gameplay is designed to foster an emotional bond between the player and their creatures. Death has real consequences - the individual norns do not return after they die. All creatures are bipedal, but there are some variant appearances that are genetically linked. Some alternate play styles include &quot;wolfling runs&quot;, where the player may not intervene in their creatures&#x27; lives, or even norn torture. Trying to selectively breed or engineer certain traits into the population is also popular, for example, coloured creatures, norns with a better immune system, or a less-aggressive grendel.

===Species===
;Norns

A Norn is an AIL (Artificial intelligent life) species, the development and survival of which constitute the main thematic elements of the program.

Norns are playful, all-trusting, naive creatures that love to explore. This is often the reason for their downfall, suffering, and death. They are more susceptible to disease in comparison to Ettins and Grendels, and in old age they may fall prey to a wasting disease that prevents them from absorbing certain nutrients.

Grand wished Norns to be endearing and for players to keep them as pets - that they should be independent and stubborn, like toddlers, that the design of the norn should be appealing to as many people as possible, and that the player should care about the norns. Reviewers have compared the Norns&#x27; visual design to the Mogwai of the &quot;Gremlins&quot; film series. The Shee originally created the Norns as a mixture of valet and pet. According to the Creatures Labs website, they spread across the galaxy through the Warp and evolved into various variations, including but not restricted to: Toxic Norn, Treehugger Norn and Magma Norns. The spread of Norns throughout the galaxy is related to the mysterious disappearance of the Shee from Albia (from the point of view of the Norns). It may also be a sign of how the Shee fared in their attempt to find a habitable planet.

In the games, the Norns have their own simulated biochemistry, haploid genetics, and neural network to serve as a brain. From &quot;Creatures 2&quot; onwards, Norns also possess organs determined by their genetics; mutation and injury can render these defunct, with typically fatal consequences. Each of these has grown somewhat over the course of the series, allowing the creatures to become more complex and intelligent. Norns are omnivores and eat a variety of foods, including carrots, lemons, seeds, insects, fish, honey, and other things. The Norns that the player starts with require some degree of training and discipline from the player in order to make good decisions to maintain their health; however, later on they can evolve to be more independent and hardy, with better-developed instincts and a more robust biochemistry. The player can take advantage of this to breed certain colours or traits through artificial selection, and through many generations the changes can become quite pronounced.

Norns are very social animals, sometimes to the extent that they will prefer to play with other norns than to eat.

;Shee

The Shee are a race of absent-minded scientists. They are the original inhabitants of Albia, and the creators of the Norns, Ettins, and Grendels.

The Shee are all inventors, and make most of their inventions to save time on tasks that would have taken but a few minutes otherwise.

Most of their discoveries are made by accident, and as such, they sequenced their own DNA and eliminated all genetic defects, before discovering the wheel.

Millennia ago, the Shee had left the disk-shaped world of Albia, as they desired to live on a &quot;more spherical world&quot;. They created the Shee Ark, took along some Norns, Ettins, and various animals and plants, and set out for their new home. The Shee Ark, like all Shee spacecraft, was itself a living creature grown from scratch, and used &quot;Bioenergy&quot; (the energy of living things, used to balance the game) to perform its various functions.

Early concepts of the Shee had them as merely a more advanced life form than the Norns, not their creators.

;Ettins
Ettins are a species in &quot;Creatures 2&quot; and &quot;Creatures 3&quot;.

Ettins were created by the Shee to help them on their experiments, especially when using machinery. They made them like machines so much, they tend to steal bits for themselves, often taking them to wherever they consider their home.

&quot;C2&quot; Ettins behave rather differently; they tend to lead a sad and lonely life underground with no one but Pitz and the occasional Grendel for company. The backstory in the guides and manual, as well as the opening sequence, reveals that they once lived in the desert at the top of Albia and, true to their nature, built the pyramid that sits there. The actual use (if any) of the pyramid is unknown.

Ettins were introduced into the &quot;Creatures&quot; series in &quot;C2&quot;, having been revealed to the world after the volcanic eruption.

An early concept of the Ettins described them as insignificant &quot;small, lizard-like creatures&quot;, who were often kept as pets by Norns.

The Ettins in &quot;Creatures 2&quot; were infertile; however, in &quot;Creatures 3&quot;, there were two Ettins aboard the Shee Ark at most times (both female), and it was possible to get them to breed if two of them were placed in the Gene Splicer machine to create a male Ettin.

An in-depth exploration of the genetics and neurology of the Ettins in &quot;Creatures 2&quot; revealed that they were constantly in pain, apparently by design. This discovery was met by fan uproar.

;Grendels

Grendels are the green-skinned, red-eyed antagonists of the Norns, over which the player has little control, stealing food and injuring individual Norns. They also carry diseases harmful to Norns. The early concepts of their appearance described them as &quot;resembling a huge, titanium spider&quot;.

In the unmodified &quot;Creatures 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, Grendels do not reproduce, being born infertile. Generally, only one Grendel is alive in the world of Albia at a time. In &quot;Creatures 3&quot;, two Grendels were alive aboard the Shee Ark at most times (both male), but it was possible to get them to breed and have offspring if both were placed in the Gene Splicer machine and used to create a female Grendel.

In all three games, Grendels are automatically produced by a &quot;Mother&quot; machine; in &quot;Creatures 3&quot;, however, it is possible to ensure that there are no Grendels in the game by killing any existing grendels (e.g. in the airlock) and then waiting by the mother, then placing any eggs into water (the piranha pool) so that they cannot hatch.

The Grendels were another genetically engineered creation of the Shee, albeit an accidental one. They were certainly not what the Shee were trying to get as a result from their experiments, and were considered to be harmful, useless monsters. However, some of the evil Shee (known as the Banshee) believed the Grendels were genetically superior to the Norns, and kept some for improvement.

It is possible to cross a Norn with a Grendel, creating a &#x27;Grenorn&#x27;.

The &quot;Creatures&quot; community has appeared to adopt the Grendel as an underdog figure, creating a &quot;Grendel Liberation Front&quot; - despite being intended to add stress to Norns&#x27; lives, players began to tame their Grendels.

===User interface===

In each of the games, players interact with the world through the use of a graphical hand as the player&#x27;s mouse in the main visual area of the game. In &quot;Creatures&quot; and &quot;Creatures 2&quot;, players can use applets in a toolbar, often called Kits, along the top of the game window, to access many functions, such as getting their first norn eggs, naming and photographing their norns, monitoring the health and general biochemistry of the norns and administering medicines, monitoring pregnancies, injecting objects into the world, and recording deceased norns. &quot;Creatures 2&quot; introduced an Ecology Kit and Neuroscience Kit.

In &quot;Creatures 3&quot; and &quot;Docking Station&quot;, players still use a hand as their mouse to interact with creatures and the world, but the main game area does not have toolbars like in &quot;Creatures&quot; and &quot;Creatures 2&quot;, but instead has areas along the sides of the screens with buttons that the user can press to move to different locations, view the current creatures in the world, manage an inventory of items, and change game settings.

Charlie Brooker regarded the level of detail shown in the monitoring kits as &quot;terrifying&quot;, and it has been argued that the detailed monitoring kits highlight the artificiality of the norns. Peter Smith disliked the limitation of C1 that the player is &quot;limited to seeing areas that you&#x27;ve tagged as favorite places or that are currently inhabited by Norns,&quot; and found it difficult to correctly reward and punish the creatures. &quot;Creatures 2&quot; introduced an angel and devil glyph which appears next to the hand to show you whether you are about to reward or punish your creature. Jim Brumbaugh, in reviewing &quot;Creatures&quot;, disliked the amount of typing that was needed to communicate with the creatures, but found the menu system &quot;highly user friendly.&quot; He noted also that there was only one way that the player could save, when the player exited the game. Eddie Walou praised the simplified user interface of &quot;Creatures 4&quot;, saying that earlier games felt like you had to have your BAC to understand. Kahn Lusth, writing for Canard PC, enjoyed the new interface of &quot;Creatures Online&quot; for communicating with creatures, where with a click of the mouse the player can choose suggestions to guide their creatures, describing it as more convenient than typing keywords. To improve the ergonomics on the iOS system, a &#x27;rubber-band&#x27; system has been created for &quot;Creatures Online&quot;, where the player draws a line between the norn and an object. When the finger is lifted, the available instructions appear.

===Environment===

While the initial pitch was for a desktop pet that could interact with other Windows programs, for example, Windows Media Player, as the game developed, the need for a self-contained world became more apparent. The world was named &quot;Albia&quot;, after Albion, and one of the goals of gameplay became to explore Albia. Grand thought that having the creatures inhabit a rich, &quot;messy&quot;, world, and to be able to interact with it in many ways would help creatures&#x27; personalities to emerge. The backdrop for &quot;Creatures&quot; was created by taking photographs of a physical model of the world, part of which is now housed at The Centre for Computing History. Sarah Kember describes Albia as a &quot;technological Eden&quot;.

The world is rendered in 2.5D, and the world can smoothly scroll to follow a creature. The world contains many different items, which creatures can interact with in a variety of ways. Objects are written using an object-oriented programming technique - each item has their own scripts which determine how they interact with creatures and with other objects. Objects are detected by a creature by being in its line of sight, which excites a neuron dedicated to that class of objects. All objects within the world are categorised, once a creature knows the name of one object, they will associate it with all other objects in that same grouping. The object-oriented approach means that the games are highly modifiable. Some of the items in the world are dangerous to norns.

In &quot;Creatures 2&quot;, the environment became more complex, with a &quot;Complete working eco-system, including weather, seasons and a functioning food-chain. The plants seed and spread around the environment if conditions allow. The result of this is a very &quot;real&quot; feeling world that adapts around the player.&quot;

In &quot;Creatures 3&quot; and &quot;Docking Station&quot;, the game was set on a spaceship. The environment became more segmented into areas called &quot;metarooms&quot;, small biomes, each with their own ecosystem. Players could download and add new metarooms to their games.

==Reception==
As of August 2023, the Creatures Community, also referred to as CC, is still active online. The CC hold a &quot;Creatures Community Spirit Festival&quot; abbreviated to CCSF every year, in order to celebrate the games and the community that has formed around them. The games were made to appeal to a wide audience, with players often ranging in age. The online community continues to archive and document the history and surrounding information of the game

Several reviews of the series emphasize that the player would need patience, and it was often recommended for players who were not parents.

The early games did not have specific goals, leading some reviewers to consider it a &#x27;small scale genetic experiment&#x27; rather than a full game. One reviewer compared the game to a &#x27;virtual fish tank&#x27;, feeling that once the frustration of raising norns through their childhood was over and a breeding population had been established, the game had become boring.

Several reviewers compared &quot;Creatures&quot; favorably to Tamagotchi when the game first came out.

Between July and November 1997, over 100,000 copies of &quot;Creatures&quot; were sold in the American market. &quot;Windows Sources&quot; magazine gave the series a &quot;Stellar Award&quot;.

Jay Schindler, a game reviewer, speculated if the game was meant to be entertainment or, instead, a simulation of parenthood. Schindler criticized the inability to scroll all the way around the world, as well as noted that raising a group of norns was much more difficult than raising a single norn, due to the fact that they could interact with each other with much greater ease than the player could interact with a norn.

Don Labriola, another game reviewer, wrote of &quot;Creatures&quot; that &quot;no other program so successfully mirrors the joys and challenges of raising a child or pet.&quot;

In 2016, the &quot;Creatures&quot; series was featured by an academic study into science-themed video games as depicting an accurate model of evolution and natural selection, displaying three key features of the process.

<text>Constant bitrate (CBR) is a term used in telecommunications, relating to the quality of service. Compare with variable bitrate.

When referring to codecs, constant bit rate encoding means that the rate at which a codec&#x27;s output data should be consumed is constant. CBR is useful for streaming multimedia content on limited capacity channels since it is the maximum bit rate that matters, not the average, so CBR would be used to take advantage of all of the capacity.

CBR is not optimal for storing data as it may not allocate enough data for complex sections (resulting in degraded quality); and if it maximizes quality for complex sections, it will waste data on simple sections.

The problem of not allocating enough data for complex sections could be solved by choosing a high bitrate to ensure that there will be enough bits for the entire encoding process, though the size of the file at the end would be proportionally larger.

Most coding schemes such as Huffman coding or run-length encoding produce variable-length codes, making perfect CBR difficult to achieve. This is partly solved by varying the quantization (quality), and fully solved by the use of padding. (However, CBR is implied in a simple scheme like reducing all 16-bit audio samples to 8 bits.)

In the case of streaming video as a CBR, the source could be under the CBR data rate target. So in order to complete the stream, it&#x27;s necessary to add stuffing packets in the stream to reach the data rate wanted. These packets are totally neutral and don&#x27;t affect the stream.

<doc id="297107" wikidata="Q1046648" url="?curid=297107" title="Sentō">
<text>is a type of Japanese communal bathhouse where customers pay for entrance. Traditionally these bathhouses have been quite utilitarian, with a tall barrier separating the sexes within one large room, a minimum of lined-up faucets on both sides, and a single large bath for the already washed bathers to sit in among others. Since the second half of the 20th century, these communal bathhouses have been decreasing in numbers as more and more Japanese residences now have baths. Some Japanese find social importance in going to public baths, out of the theory that physical proximity/intimacy brings emotional intimacy, which is termed &quot;skinship&quot; in pseudo-English Japanese. Others go to a &quot;sentō&quot; because they live in a small housing facility without a private bath or to enjoy bathing in a spacious room and to relax in saunas or jet baths that often accompany new or renovated sentōs.

Another type of Japanese public bath is &quot;onsen&quot;, which uses hot water from a natural hot spring. In general, the word onsen means that the bathing facility has at least one bath filled with natural hot spring water. However, throughout the Kansai region of Japan, the word &quot;onsen&quot; is also a commonly used naming scheme for sentō. Sentō and supersentō in Kansai that do have access to a hot spring will often differentiate themselves by having &quot;natural hot spring&quot; (天然温泉) somewhere on their signage.

==Layout and architectural features==
===Entrance area===
There are many different layouts for a Japanese &quot;sentō&quot; or public bath. Most traditional &quot;sentō&quot;, however, are very similar to the layout shown on the right. The entrance from the outside looks somewhat similar to a temple, with a Japanese curtain (暖簾, &quot;noren&quot;) across the entrance. The curtain is usually blue and shows the kanji 湯 (&quot;yu&quot;, lit. hot water) or the corresponding hiragana ゆ. After the entrance, there is an area with shoe lockers, followed by two long curtains or doors, one on each side. These lead to the &quot;datsuijo&quot; (脱衣場, changing room), also known as &quot;datsuiba&quot; for the men and women respectively. The men&#x27;s and the women&#x27;s sides are very similar and differ only slightly.

===Changing room===
A public bathing facility in Japan typically has one of two kinds of entrances. One is the front desk variety, where a person in charge sits at a front desk, abbreviated as &quot;front.&quot; The other entrance variety is the bandai style. In Tokyo, 660 sentō facilities have a &quot;front&quot;-type entrance, while only 315 still have the more traditional bandai-style entrance.

Inside, between the entrances is the &quot;bandai&quot; (番台), where the attendant sits. The &quot;bandai&quot; is a rectangular or horseshoe-shaped platform with a railing, usually around 1.5 to 1.8 m high. Above the &quot;bandai&quot; is usually a large clock. Immediately in front of the &quot;bandai&quot; is usually a utility door, to be used by the attendants only. The dressing room is approximately 10 m by 10 m, sometimes partly covered with tatami sheets and contains lockers for clothes. Often, there is a large shelf storing equipment for regular customers.

The ceiling is very high, at 3 to 4 m. The separating wall between the men&#x27;s and the women&#x27;s side is about 1.5 m high. The dressing room also often has access to a very small Japanese garden with a pond and a Japanese-style toilet. There are a number of tables and chairs, including some coin-operated massage chairs. Usually, there is also a scale to measure weight, and sometimes height. In some very old &quot;sentō&quot;, this scale may use the traditional Japanese measure &quot;monme&quot; (匁, 1 monme = 3.75 g) and &quot;kan&quot; (1 kan = 1000 monme = 3.75 kg). Similarly, in old &quot;sentō&quot; the height scale may go only to 180 cm. Local business often advertises in the &quot;sentō&quot;. The women&#x27;s side usually has some baby beds and may have more mirrors. The decoration and the advertising are often gender-specific on the different sides. There is usually a refreshment cooler there where the customers can self-serve and pay the attendant. Milk drinks are traditional favorites and sometimes there is ice cream.

===Bathing area===
The bathing area is separated from the changing area by a sliding door to keep the heat in the bath. An exception are baths in Okinawa, where the climate is warmer and there is no need to keep the hot air in the bath. Sentō in Okinawa usually have no separation between the changing room and the bathing area or only a small wall with an opening to pass through.

The bathing area is usually tiled. Near the entrance area is a supply of small stools and buckets. There are a number of washing stations at the wall and sometimes in the middle of the room, each with usually two faucets (&quot;karan&quot;, カラン, after the Dutch word &quot;kraan&quot; for faucet), one for hot water and one for cold water, and a showerhead.

At the end of the room are the bathtubs, usually at least two or three with different water temperatures, and maybe a &#x27;denki buro&#x27; (電気風呂, electric bath). In the Osaka and Kansai area the bathtubs are more often found in the center of the room, whereas in Tokyo they are usually at the end of the room. The separating wall between the men and the women side is also about 1.5 m high. The ceiling may be 4 m high, with large windows in the top. On rare occasions, the separating wall also has a small hole. This was used to pass soap. At the wall on the far end of the room is usually a large ceramic tile mural or painting for decoration. Most often this is Mount Fuji, but it may be a general Japanese landscape, a (faux) European landscape, a river or ocean scene. On rarer occasions, it may also show a group of warriors or a female nude on the male side. Playing children or a female beauty often decorates the women&#x27;s side.

===Boiler room===
Behind the bathing area is the boiler room (釜場, &quot;kamaba&quot;), where the water is heated. The boiler may be powered by heating oil, electricity, or be fuelled by wood chippings or any other suitable fuel source. The tall chimneys of the boilers are often used to locate the &quot;sentō&quot; from far away. After World War II, Tokyo often had power outages when all bathhouse owners turned on the electric water heating at the same time.

===Sauna===
Many modern &quot;sentō&quot; have a sauna with a bathtub of cold water (around 17 degrees Celsius) just outside it for cooling off afterward. Visitors are sometimes expected to pay an extra fee to use the sauna and are often given a wristband to signify this payment.

==Etiquette==

The Japanese public bath is one area where the uninitiated can upset regular customers by not following correct bathing etiquette designed to respect others; in particular, not washing before bathing, dipping your towel into the water, introducing soap into the bathwater, and horseplay. &quot;Sentō&quot; commonly displays a poster, a leaflet, and/or a brochure describing bathing etiquette and procedures in Japanese or occasionally in other languages for international customers.

Some ports in Hokkaidō, frequently used by foreign fishing fleets, had problems with drunken sailors misbehaving in the bath. Subsequently, a few bathhouses chose not to allow foreign customers at all.

It is common to hear people say, &quot;gokuraku, gokuraku&quot; when they get into the bath. It means something to the level of divine pleasure; it is a good feeling for the body and the soul.

===Equipment===
Taking a bath at a public &quot;sentō&quot; requires at a bare minimum a small towel and some soap/shampoo. Attendants usually sell these items for 100-200 yen. Many people bring two towels; a hand towel for drying and a hand towel or washcloth for washing. A nylon scrubbing cloth or scrub brush with liquid soap is normally used for washing. Other body hygiene products may include a pumice stone, toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving equipment, combs, shower caps, pomade, makeup products, powder, creams, etc. Some regular customers store their bucket of bathing equipment on open shelves in the dressing room.

===Entrance and undressing===
In Japan, it is customary to remove one&#x27;s shoes when entering a private home. Similarly, shoes are removed before entering the bathing area in a &quot;sentō&quot;. They are kept in a shoe locker. The locker is usually available free of charge. In a gender-segregated sentō, bathers go through one of the two doors. The men&#x27;s door usually has a blue color and the kanji for man (男, &quot;otoko&quot;) and the women&#x27;s door usually has a pink color and the kanji for woman (女, &quot;onna&quot;). The attendant usually provides at extra cost a variety of bath products including towels, soap, shampoo, razors, and combs; ice cream or juice from the freezer can also be paid for here.
There are usually free lockers with keys (that may be worn on the wrist into the baths) or large baskets provided to put personal effects.

===Bathing area===
At &quot;onsen&quot; or hot springs, the water contains minerals and many people do not rinse off the water from the skin, to increase exposure to the minerals. In a regular &quot;sentō&quot;, people usually rinse off at the faucets.

===Tattoos===
Some public baths have signs refusing entry for people with tattoos. However, one may be allowed in if the tattoos are not too obvious. If one ventures to a public bathing place that is publicly owned, this should not present a problem as they have a duty to let all tax-paying citizens in. The original reason behind the ban was to keep out the &quot;yakuza&quot; (officially called the &quot;violence groups&quot; by the police).

==Sanitation==
Japanese public baths have experienced infrequent outbreaks of dangerous &quot;Legionella&quot; bacteria. In order to prevent such problems, the &quot;sentō&quot; union adds chlorine to its baths. At the cost of higher levels of chlorine, bacteria outbreaks are practically non-existent at sentō facilities of today. 

==Pricing==

Rules and pricing are regulated per prefecture based on local committees. In 2022, basic admission for adults in Tokyo is ¥500. Citing a rise in oil prices, the price rose from ¥400 (2000–2006), to ¥430 (2006–2008) and again to ¥450 (2008–present). The price for child admission was unchanged until 2022 when the price for 6- to 11-year-olds rose to ¥200 and that for younger children to ¥100.

Girls 13 years or younger and boys 8 or younger are usually permitted to enter the baths of either gender. In other prefectures, the cut-off age can be as high as 16 in Hokkaidō or as low as 5 in Hyōgo.

Most sentō in Tokyo also offer a premium service for which each facility sets its own price, usually around ¥1,000. This option is usually called a sauna since at least a sauna is included. At Civic Land Nissei, for example, the sauna option includes access to more than half the facilities available.

Larger-scale public bathing facilities are called super sentō and kenkō land, both more expensive than sentō, though super sentō offer a more modest price compared to kenkō.

At ¥300 per adult, the cheapest prefectures for sentō baths are Yamagata, Tokushima, Nagasaki, Ōita, and Miyazaki.

==History==
The origins of the Japanese sentō and the Japanese bathing culture, in general, can be traced to the Shinto ritual purification of kegare. This condition can be remedied through purification rites called misogi and harae.

===Nara period to Kamakura period===
Baths in Japan were usually found in Buddhist temples. These baths were called &quot;yuya&quot; (, lit. hot water shop), or later when they increased in size &quot;ōyuya&quot; (, lit. big hot water shop). These baths were most often steam baths (, &quot;mushiburo&quot;, lit. steam bath). While initially these baths were only used by priests, sick people gradually also gained access, until in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) sick people were routinely allowed access to the bathhouse. Wealthy merchants and members of the upper class soon also included baths in their residences.

===Kamakura period===
The first mentioning of a commercial bathhouse is in 1266 in the &quot;Nichiren Goshoroku&quot; (). These mixed-sex bath houses were only vaguely similar to modern bathhouses. After entering the bath, there was a changing room called &quot;datsuijo&quot; (). There the customer also received his/her ration of hot water, since there were no faucets in the actual bath. The entrance to the steam bath was only a very small opening with a height of about 80 cm, so that the heat did not escape. Due to the small opening, the lack of windows, and the thick steam, these baths were usually very dark, and customers often cleared their throats to signal their position to others.

===Edo period===
At the beginning of the Edo period (1603–1867), there were two types of baths common to the eastern and western regions of Japan respectively. In Edo (present-day Tokyo), bathhouses contained sizable pools and were called &quot;yuya&quot; (湯屋, lit. hot water shop). In Osaka, however, bathing establishments were primarily steam baths called &quot;mushiburo&quot; (蒸し風呂, lit. steam bath) that had only shallow pools.

At the end of the Edo period, the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1868) at different times required baths to segregate by sex in order to ensure public moral standards. However, many bathhouse owners merely partitioned their baths with a small board, allowing some voyeurism to persist. Other baths avoided this problem by having men and women bathe at different times of day, or by catering to one gender exclusively. In spite of this, laws regarding mixed-sex bathing were soon relaxed again.

Contributing to the popularity of public baths in the Edo period were female bathing attendants were known as &quot;yuna&quot; (湯女, lit. hot water women). These attendants helped cleanse customers by scrubbing their backs. After official closing hours, however, a number of these women would perform additional services by selling sex to male customers. Similarly, some brothels in contemporary Japan have women who specialize in bathing with and cleansing male clientele. Such establishments are often called &quot;sōpu rando&quot; (ソープランド, soapland).

As a preventive measure against prostitution, the Tokugawa shogunate stipulated that no more than three yuna serve at any given bathhouse. However, this rule was widely ignored, causing the shogunate to ban female attendants from bathhouses altogether and once again prohibit the practice of mixed-sex bathing. Large numbers of unemployed yuna thereafter moved to official red-light districts, where they could continue their services. Up until 1870, there were also male washing assistants called &quot;sansuke&quot; (三助, lit. three bits of help) who would wash and massage customers of both genders. Unlike the yuna, these male attendants were not known to engage in prostitution.

Mixed-sex bathing was prohibited once again after Commodore Perry visited Japan in 1853 and 1854—drawing question to the morality of the practice.

===Meiji period===

During the Meiji period (1867–1912), the design of Japanese baths changed considerably. The narrow entrance to the bathing area was widened considerably to a regular-sized sliding door, the bathtubs were sunk partially in the floor so that they could be entered more easily, and the height of the ceiling of the bathhouse was then doubled. Since the bath now focused on hot water instead of steam, windows could be added, and the bathing area became much brighter. The only difference between these baths and the modern bath was the use of wood for the bathing area and the lack of faucets.

Furthermore, another law for segregated bathing was passed in 1890, allowing only children below the age of 8 to join a parent of the opposite sex.

===Rebuilding===
At the beginning of the Taishō period (1912–1926), tiles gradually replaced wooden floors and walls in new bathhouses. On September 1, 1923, the great Kantō earthquake devastated Tokyo. The earthquake and the subsequent fire destroyed most baths in the Tokyo area. This accelerated the change from wooden baths to tiled baths, as almost all new bathhouses were now built in the new style using tiled bathing areas. At the end of the Taishō period, faucets also became more common, and this type of faucet can still be seen today. These faucets were called &quot;karan&quot; (カラン, after the Dutch word &quot;kraan&quot; for faucet). There were two faucets, one for hot water and one for cold water, and the customer mixed the water in their bucket according to their personal taste.

===Golden era===
During World War II (for Japan, 1941–1945), many Japanese cities were damaged. Subsequently, most bathhouses were destroyed along with the cities. The lack of baths caused the reappearance of communal bathing and temporary baths were constructed with the available material, often lacking a roof. Furthermore, as most houses were damaged or destroyed, few people had access to a private bath, resulting in a great increase in customers for the bathhouses. New buildings in the post-war period also often lacked baths or showers, leading to a strong increase in the number of public baths. In 1965, many baths also added showerheads to the faucets in baths. The number of public baths in Japan peaked around 1970.

===Decline===

Immediately after World War II, resources were scarce and few homeowners had access to a private bath. Private baths began to be more common around 1970, and most new buildings included a bath and shower unit for every apartment. Easy access to private baths led to a decline in customers for public bathhouses, and subsequently, the number of bathhouses is decreasing. Some Japanese young people today are embarrassed to be seen naked and avoid public baths for this reason. Some Japanese are concerned that without the &quot;skinship&quot; of mutual nakedness, children will not be properly socialized.

===Future===
While the traditional &quot;sentō&quot; is in decline, many bathhouse operators have adjusted to the new taste of the public and are offering a wide variety of experiences. Some bathhouses emphasize their tradition and run traditionally-designed bathhouses to appeal to clientele seeking lost Japan. These bathhouses are also often located in scenic areas and may include an open-air bath. Some also try drilling in order to gain access to a hot spring, turning a regular bathhouse into a more prestigious &quot;onsen&quot;.

Other bathhouses with less pristine buildings or settings change into so-called super &quot;sentō&quot; and try to offer a wider variety of services beyond the standard two or three bathtubs. They may include a variety of saunas, reintroduce steam baths, include jacuzzis and may even have a water slide. They may also offer services beyond mere cleansing, and turn into a spa, offering medical baths, massages, mud baths, fitness centers, etc., as for example the &quot;Spa LaQua&quot; at the Tokyo Dome City entertainment complex. There are also entire bathhouse-themed parks, including restaurants, karaoke and other entertainment, for example the &quot;Ōedo Onsen Monogatari&quot; (大江戸温泉物語, Big Edo Hot Spring Story) in Odaiba, Tokyo. (Note: The &quot;Ōedo Onsen Monogatari&quot; is not a &quot;sentō&quot;.) Some of these modern facilities may require swimsuits and are similar in size and function to an indoor water park.

<text>Reservoir Dogs is a 1992 American crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino in his feature-length directorial debut. It stars Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney, Michael Madsen, Tarantino, and Edward Bunker as diamond thieves whose heist of a jewelry store goes terribly wrong. Kirk Baltz, Randy Brooks, and Steven Wright also play supporting roles. The film incorporates many motifs that have become Tarantino&#x27;s hallmarks: violent crime, pop culture references, profanity, and nonlinear storytelling.

The film is regarded as a classic of independent film and a cult film. Although controversial at first for its depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; was generally well-received, and the cast was praised by many critics. Despite not being heavily promoted during its theatrical run, the film became a modest success in the United States after grossing $2.9 million against its scant budget. It achieved higher popularity after the success of Tarantino&#x27;s next film, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994). A soundtrack was released featuring songs used in the film, which are mostly from the 1970s. It was named &quot;Greatest Independent Film of All Time&quot; by the British film magazine &quot;Empire&quot;, who in 2008 also named it the 97th-greatest film ever made.

==Plot==
Eight men eat breakfast at a diner. All but the boss, Joe Cabot, and his son, &quot;Nice Guy&quot; Eddie Cabot, use aliases: Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.

The men carry out a diamond heist. White flees with Orange, who was shot during the escape and is bleeding profusely in the back seat of a car driven by White. At their hideout, White and Orange rendezvous with Pink, who believes that the job was a setup and that the police were waiting for them. White informs him that Brown is dead, Blue and Blonde are missing, and Blonde murdered several civilians during the heist. White is furious that Joe, his old friend, would employ Blonde, whom he describes as a psychopath. Pink has hidden the diamonds nearby and argues with White over whether to get medical attention for Orange, and the pair draw guns on each other. They stand down when Blonde arrives with a kidnapped policeman, Marvin Nash.

Sometime earlier, Blonde meets with the Cabots, having been paroled after a four-year prison sentence. To reward him for not giving Joe&#x27;s name to the authorities, they offer him a no-show job. Blonde is grateful but insists that he wants to get back to &quot;real work&quot;, and they recruit him for the heist.

In the present, White and Pink beat Nash for information. Eddie arrives and orders them to go with him to ditch the getaway vehicles, leaving Blonde in charge of Nash and Orange. Nash denies knowledge, but Blonde ignores him and resumes the torture, cutting off Nash&#x27;s ear with a straight razor. He prepares to set him on fire, but Orange shoots Blonde dead. Orange reveals to Nash that he is an undercover police officer, and that the police will arrive when Joe comes to the warehouse.

When Eddie, Pink, and White return, Orange tries to convince them that Blonde planned to kill them all and steal the diamonds for himself. Eddie shoots and kills Nash and accuses Orange of lying, since Blonde was loyal to his father. Joe arrives with news that the police have killed Blue. He is about to execute Orange, who he suspects is the traitor behind the setup, but White intervenes and holds Joe at gunpoint, insisting that Orange is not a police officer. Eddie aims his gun at White, creating a Mexican standoff. All three fire. Both Cabots are killed, and White and Orange are hit.

Pink takes the diamonds and flees, but a crash is heard outside and gunshots follow. As White cradles the dying Orange in his arms, Orange confesses that he is a police officer. White presses his gun to Orange&#x27;s head. The police storm the warehouse and order White to drop his gun. White is killed by the police after he shoots Orange.

== Cast ==

Rich Turner played Sheriff #1. Nina Siemaszko played police officer Jody McClusky; her scenes were deleted from the theatrical release. There is an unseen accomplice of Joe and Eddie who speaks to Eddie on the phone. His name is Dov Schwarz, named after the sound editor on &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Birthday&quot;.

== Production ==
Quentin Tarantino had been working at Video Archives, a video store in Manhattan Beach, California, and originally planned to shoot the film with his friends on a budget of $30,000 in a 16 mm black-and-white format, with himself playing Mr. Pink and producer Lawrence Bender playing both Nice Guy Eddie and a police officer chasing Mr. Pink. Bender gave the script to his acting teacher, whose wife gave the script to Harvey Keitel. Keitel liked it enough to sign as a co-producer so Tarantino and Bender would have an easier job finding funding; with his assistance, they raised $1.5 million. Keitel also paid for Tarantino and Bender to host casting sessions in New York, where the duo found Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth. Jon Cryer was asked to audition for the role of Mr. Pink, but he backed out at the last minute. James Woods was also considered for Mr. Pink, but his agent turned it down without telling him. Viggo Mortensen and George Clooney also read for roles, while Tim Roth&#x27;s agents originally wanted him to be Mr. Pink or Mr. Blonde, but he preferred Mr. Orange because he would &quot;be an English actor pretending to be American playing a cop pretending to be a robber&quot;.

The film contains multiple homages to other films. Tarantino himself has said that &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; was influenced by Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1956 film noir &quot;The Killing&quot;: &quot;I didn&#x27;t go out of my way to do a rip-off of &quot;The Killing&quot;, but I did think of it as my &#x27;Killing&#x27;, my take on that kind of heist movie.&quot; The film&#x27;s plot was also inspired by the 1952 film &quot;Kansas City Confidential&quot;. Additionally, Joseph H. Lewis&#x27;s 1955 film &quot;The Big Combo&quot; and Sergio Corbucci&#x27;s 1966 Spaghetti Western &quot;Django&quot; inspired the scene where a police officer is tortured in a chair. Having the main characters named after colors (Mr. Pink, White, Brown, etc.) was first seen in the 1974 film &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot;. The film also contains key elements similar to those found in Ringo Lam&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;City on Fire&quot;. Tarantino praised the film &quot;City on Fire&quot; and mentioned it as a major influence.

Tarantino said that everybody hated Lawrence Tierney by the end of the first week of production.

The warehouse scenes were filmed in an unused mortuary filled with caskets, funeral equipment, embalming fluid, and a hearse. Mr. Orange&#x27;s apartment was a room on the second floor of the mortuary, set to look like living quarters. The building has since been demolished.

Tarantino&#x27;s decision not to film the diamond robbery was twofold: for budgetary reasons, and to keep the details of the heist ambiguous. By not showing the robbery and having the characters describe it, Tarantino explained, the film is allowed to be &quot;about other things&quot;, similar to the way in which the burglary in &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; and its film adaptation is discussed, described, and debated, but never shown. Tarantino compared the technique to the work of a novelist, and said he wanted the film to be about something not seen and to &quot;play with a real-time clock as opposed to a movie clock ticking&quot;.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1992. It became the festival&#x27;s most talked-about film, and it was subsequently picked up for distribution by Miramax Films. After being shown at several other film festivals, including in Cannes, Sitges, and Toronto, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; opened in the United States in 19 theaters on October 9, 1992, with a first week total of $147,839. It was expanded to 61 theaters on October 23, 1992, and totaled $2,832,029 at the domestic box office. The film grossed more than double that in the United Kingdom, where it did not receive a home video release until 1995. During the period of unavailability on home video, the film was re-released in UK cinemas in June 1994.

=== Critical reception ===

&quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; is regarded as an important and influential milestone of independent filmmaking. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 90% based on 81 reviews, and an average rating of 8.9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Thrumming with intelligence and energy, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; opens Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s filmmaking career with hard-hitting style.&quot; On Metacritic the film has an average score of 81 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine named it the &quot;Greatest Independent Film&quot; ever made.

At the film&#x27;s release at the Sundance Film Festival, film critic Jami Bernard of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; compared the effect of &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; to that of the 1895 film &quot;L&#x27;Arrivée d&#x27;un Train en Gare de la Ciotat&quot;, when audiences supposedly saw a moving train approaching the camera and ducked. Bernard said that &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; had a similar effect and people were not ready for it. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; enjoyed the cast and the usage of non-linear storytelling. He similarly complimented Tarantino&#x27;s directing and liked the fact that he did not often use close-ups in the film. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; also enjoyed the film and the acting, particularly that of Buscemi, Tierney and Madsen, and said &quot;Tarantino&#x27;s palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he&#x27;s created, reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer than you might suspect.&quot; Critic James Berardinelli was of a similar opinion; he complimented both the cast and Tarantino&#x27;s dialogue writing abilities. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was also enthusiastic about the cast, complimenting the film on its &quot;deadpan sense of humor&quot;.

Roger Ebert was less enthusiastic, as he felt that the script could have been better and said that the film &quot;feels like it&#x27;s going to be terrific&quot;, but Tarantino&#x27;s script does not have much curiosity about the characters. He also said that Tarantino &quot;has an idea, and trusts the idea to drive the plot.&quot; Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four and said that while he enjoyed it and that it was a very good film from a talented director, &quot;I liked what I saw, but I wanted more.&quot;

The film has received substantial criticism for its strong violence and language. One scene that viewers found particularly unnerving was the ear-cutting scene. Madsen himself reportedly had great difficulty finishing it, especially after Kirk Baltz ad-libbed the desperate plea &quot;I&#x27;ve got a little kid at home.&quot; Many people walked out during the film. During a screening at Sitges Film Festival, 15 people walked out, including horror film director Wes Craven and special makeup effects artist Rick Baker. Baker later told Tarantino to take the walkout as a &quot;compliment&quot; and explained that he found the violence unnerving because of its heightened sense of realism. Tarantino commented about it at the time: &quot;It happens at every single screening. For some people the violence, or the rudeness of the language, is a mountain they can&#x27;t climb. That&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s not their cup of tea. But I am affecting them. I wanted that scene to be disturbing.&quot;

=== Analysis ===
&quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; has often been seen as a prominent film in terms of on-screen violence. J. P. Telotte compared &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; to classic caper noir films and points out the irony in its ending scenes. Mark Irwin also made the connection between &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and classic American noir. Caroline Jewers called &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; a &quot;feudal epic&quot; and paralleled the color pseudonyms to color names of medieval knights.

Critics have observed parallels between &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and other films. For its nonlinear storyline, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; has often been compared to Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Rashomon&quot;. Critic John Hartl compared the ear-cutting scene to the shower murder scene in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; and Tarantino to David Lynch. He furthermore explored parallels between &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;. Todd McCarthy, who called the film &quot;undeniably impressive&quot;, was of the opinion that it was influenced by &quot;Mean Streets&quot;, &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;The Killing&quot;. After this film, Tarantino himself was also compared to Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah, John Singleton, Gus Van Sant, and Abel Ferrara.

A frequently cited comparison has been to Tarantino&#x27;s second and more successful film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, especially since the majority of audiences saw &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; after the success of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Comparisons have been made regarding the black humor in both the films, the theme of accidents, and more concretely, the style of dialogue and narrative that Tarantino incorporates into both films. Specifically the relationship between white people and black people plays a big part in the filmsthough underplayed in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;. Stanley Crouch of &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared the way the white criminals speak of black people in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; to the way they are spoken of in Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Mean Streets&quot; and &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. Crouch observed the way black people are looked down upon in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, but also the way that the criminals accuse each other of &quot;verbally imitating&quot; black men and the characters&#x27; apparent sexual attraction to black actress Pam Grier.

In February 2012, as part of an ongoing series of live dramatic readings of film scripts being staged with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), director Jason Reitman cast black actors in the originally white cast: Laurence Fishburne as Mr. White; Terrence Howard as Mr. Blonde; Anthony Mackie as Mr. Pink; Cuba Gooding Jr. as Mr. Orange; Chi McBride as Joe Cabot; Anthony Anderson as Nice Guy Eddie (Joe Cabot&#x27;s son); Common as both Mr. Brown and Officer Nash (the torture victim of Mr. Blonde), and Patton Oswalt as Holdaway (the mentor cop who was originally played by Randy Brooks, the only black actor in the film). Critic Elvis Mitchell suggested that Reitman&#x27;s version of the script was taking the source material back to its roots since the characters &quot;all sound like black dudes.&quot;

=== Accolades ===

The film was screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.
It won the Critic&#x27;s Award at the 4th Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival in February 1993, which Tarantino attended. The film was also nominated for the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics. Steve Buscemi won the 1992 Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male. &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; ranks at 97 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Films of All Time. In 2024, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; was ranked second on the list of the Sundance Film Festival&#x27;s Top 10 films of All Time based on a survey conducted with 500 filmmakers and critics in honor of the festival&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

** Mr. Blonde – Nominated Villain

== Home media ==
In the United Kingdom, release of the VHS rental video was delayed until 1995 due to the British Board of Film Classification initially refusing the film a home video certificate (UK releases are required to be certified separately for theatrical release and for viewing at home). The latter is a requirement by law due to the Video Recordings Act 1984. Following the UK VHS release approval, PolyGram released a &quot;Mr Blonde Deluxe Edition&quot;, which included an interview with Tarantino and several memorabilia associated with the character Mr. Blonde, such as sunglasses and a chrome toothpick holder.

Region 1 DVDs of &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; have been released multiple times. The first release was a single two-sided disc from LIVE Entertainment, released in June 1997 and featuring two versions of the film: the original letterbox 2.35:1 widescreen version and an open matte 1.33:1 full screen version. Five years later, on August 27, 2002, Artisan Entertainment (who changed their name from LIVE Entertainment in the interim) released a two-disc 10th anniversary edition on DVD and VHS featuring multiple covers color-coded to match the nicknames of five of the characters (Pink, White, Orange, Blonde, and Brown) and a disc of bonus features such as interviews with the cast and crew. However, the full screen version on the second disc was a pan and scan transfer from the 2.35:1 widescreen version, as opposed to open matte like the 1997 DVD.

For the film&#x27;s 15th anniversary, Lionsgate (which had purchased Artisan in the interim) produced a two-disc anniversary edition with a remastered 16:9 transfer and a new supplement, but not all of the extra features from the 10th Anniversary edition. In particular, the interviews with the cast and crew were removed, and a new 48-minute-long feature called &quot;Tributes and Dedications&quot; was included.

Lionsgate Home Entertainment celebrated the 30th anniversary of &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; with a 4K Blu-ray release, which was released in the U.S. on November 15, 2022.

== Soundtrack ==

The &quot;Reservoir Dogs: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; was the first soundtrack for a Tarantino film and set the structure his later soundtracks would follow. This includes the extensive use of snippets of dialogue from the film. The soundtrack has selections of songs from the 1960s to &#x27;80s. Only the group Bedlam recorded original songs for the film. Reasoning that the film takes place over a weekend, Tarantino decided to set it to a fictional radio station &#x27;K-Billy&#x27; (presumably KBLY)&#x27;s show &quot;K-Billy&#x27;s Super Sounds of the Seventies Weekend&quot;, a themed weekend show of broadcasts of songs from the seventies. The radio station played a prominent role in the film. The DJ for the radio was chosen to be Steven Wright, a comedian known for his deadpan delivery of jokes.

An unusual feature of the soundtrack was the choice of songs; Tarantino has said that he feels the music to be a counterpoint to the on-screen violence and action. He also stated that he wished for the film to have a 1950s feel while using &#x27;70s music. A prominent instance of this is the torture scene to the tune of &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot;.

== Video games ==

A video game based on the film was released in 2006 for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 2. However, the game does not feature the likeness of any of the actors with the exception of Michael Madsen. The game was received unfavorably, with GameSpot calling it &quot;an out and out failure&quot;. It caused controversy for its amount of violence and it was banned in Australia, Germany and New Zealand.

Another video game, &quot;Reservoir Dogs: Bloody Days&quot;, was released in 2017.

On December 14, 2017, Overkill Software added a heist to &quot;Payday 2&quot; inspired by &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; in which the player is contracted to rob a jewelry store in Los Angeles with the Cabot family. It is unique in that the heist is played in reverse order, with day two occurring prior to day one, similar to how the film&#x27;s plot is out of chronological order.

== Remakes ==
&quot;Kaante&quot;, a Bollywood film released in 2002, is a remake of &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, combined with elements of &quot;City on Fire&quot;. The film also borrows plot points from &quot;Heat&quot; and &quot;The Killing&quot;. Tarantino has been quoted as saying that &quot;Kaante&quot; is his favorite among the many films inspired by his work. Tarantino later screened &quot;Kaante&quot; at his New Beverly Cinema alongside &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and &quot;City on Fire&quot;.

Tarantino revealed in June 2021 that he had at one point considered remaking &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; as his tenth and final directed film, though he quickly iterated that he &quot;won&#x27;t do it&quot;.

<doc id="297113" wikidata="Q1137295" url="?curid=297113" title="Frogman">
<text>A frogman is someone who is trained in scuba diving or swimming underwater in a tactical capacity that includes military, and in some European countries, police work. Such personnel are also known by the more formal names of combat diver, combatant diver, or combat swimmer. The word &quot;frogman&quot; first arose in the stage name the &quot;Fearless Frogman&quot; of Paul Boyton in the 1870s and later was claimed by John Spence, an enlisted member of the U.S. Navy and member of the OSS Maritime Unit, to have been applied to him while he was training in a green waterproof suit.

The term &quot;frogman&quot; is occasionally used to refer to a civilian scuba diver, such as in a police diving role.

In the United Kingdom, police divers have often been called &quot;police frogmen&quot;.

Some countries&#x27; tactical diver organizations include a translation of the word &quot;frogman&quot; in their official names, e.g., Denmark&#x27;s &quot;Frømandskorpset&quot;; others call themselves &quot;combat divers&quot; or similar. 

==Scope of operations==
Tactical diving is a branch of professional diving carried out by armed forces and tactical units. They may be divided into:
* Combat or assault divers.
* Special mission work divers (called &quot;clearance divers&quot; in the British Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy), who do general work underwater.
* Work divers who are trained in defusing mines and removing other explosives underwater.
These groups may overlap, and the same men may serve as assault divers and work divers, such as the Australian Clearance Diving Branch (RAN).

The range of operations performed by these operatives includes:
*Amphibious assault: stealthy deployment of land or boarding forces. The vast majority of combat swimmer missions are simply to get &quot;from here to there&quot; and arrive suitably equipped and in sufficient physical condition to fight on arrival. The deployment of tactical forces by water to assault land targets, oil platforms, or surface ship targets (as in boardings for seizure of evidence) is a major driver behind the equipping and training of combat swimmers. The purposes are many, but include feint and deception, counter-drug, law enforcement, counter-terrorism, and counter-proliferation missions.
*Sabotage: This includes putting limpet mines on ships.
*Clandestine surveying: Surveying a beach before a troop landing, or other forms of unauthorized underwater surveying in denied waters. 
*Clandestine underwater work, e.g.:
** Recovering underwater objects.
** Clandestine fitting of monitoring devices on submarine communications cables in enemy waters.
*Investigating unidentified divers, or a sonar echo that may be unidentified divers. Police diving work may be included.
*Checking ships, boats, structures, and harbors for limpet mines and other sabotage; and ordinary routine maintenance in war conditions. 
*Underwater mine clearance and bomb disposal.

Typically, a diver with closed circuit oxygen rebreathing equipment will stay within a depth limit of with limited deeper excursions to a maximum of because of the risk of seizure due to acute oxygen toxicity. The use of nitrox or mixed gas rebreathers can extend this depth range considerably, but this may be beyond the scope of operations, depending on the unit.

===Mission descriptions===
US and UK forces use these official definitions for mission descriptors:
; Stealthy: keeping out of sight (e.g., underwater) when approaching the target.
; Covert: carrying out an action of which the enemy may become aware, but whose perpetrator cannot easily be discovered or apprehended. Covert action often involves military force which cannot be hidden once it has happened. Stealth on approach, and frequently on departure, may be used.
; Clandestine: it is intended that the enemy does not find out then or afterwards that the action has happened – for example, installing eavesdropping devices. Approach, installing the devices, and departure are all to be kept from the knowledge of the enemy. If the operation or its purpose is exposed, then the actor will usually make sure that the action at least remains &quot;covert&quot;, or unattributable.

===Defending against frogmen===
Anti-frogman techniques are security methods developed to protect watercraft, ports and installations, and other sensitive resources both in or nearby vulnerable waterways from potential threats or intrusions by frogmen.

==Equipment==
Frogmen on clandestine operations use rebreathers, as the bubbles released by open-circuit scuba would reveal them to surface lookouts and make a noise which hydrophones could easily detect.

== Origins of the name ==
A few different explanations have been given for the origin of the term frogman.
* Paul Boyton adopted the stage name &quot;The Fearless Frogman&quot;. In the 1870s, he was a long distance swimmer who wore a rubber immersion suit, with hood.
* In an interview with historian Erick Simmel, John Spence claimed that the name &quot;frogman&quot; was coined while he was training in a green waterproof suit, &quot;Someone saw me surfacing one day and yelled out, &#x27;Hey, frogman!&#x27; The name stuck for all of us.&quot;

==History==
In ancient Roman and Greek times, there were instances of men swimming or diving for combat, sometimes using a hollow plant stem or a long bone as a snorkel. Diving with snorkel is mentioned by Aristotle (4th century BC). The earliest descriptions of frogmen in war are found in Thucydides&#x27; &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;. The first instance was in 425 BC, when the Athenian fleet besieged the Spartans on the small island of Sphacteria. The Spartans managed to get supplies from the mainland by underwater swimmers towing submerged sacks of supplies. In another incident of the same war, in 415 BC, the Athenians used combat divers in the port of Syracuse, Sicily. The Syracuseans had planted vertical wooden poles in the bottom around their port, to prevent the Athenian triremes from entering. The poles were submerged, not visible above the sea level. The Athenians used various means to cut these obstacles, including divers with saws. It is believed that the underwater sawing required snorkels for breathing and diving weights to keep the divers stable.

Also, in the writings of Al-Maqrizi, it is also claimed that the naval forces of the Fatimid Caliphate, in an engagement with Byzantine forces off the coast of Messina henceforth referred to as the Battle of the Straits, employed a novel strategy with strong similarities to modern-day frogmen tactics. In the writings of Heinz Halm, who studied and translated the writings of Al-Maqrizi and other contemporary Islamic historians, it is described: &quot;They would dive from their own ship and swim over to the enemy ship; they would fasten ropes to its rudder, along which earthenware pots containing Greek fire were then made to slide over to the enemy ship, and shattered on the sternpost.&quot; Apparently, this tactic succeeded in destroying many Byzantine vessels, and the battle ended in a major Fatimid victory; according to the Arab historians, a thousand prisoners were taken, including the Byzantine admiral, Niketas, with many of his officers, as well as a heavy Indian sword which bore an inscription indicating that it had once belonged to Muhammad.

The Hungarian Chronicon Pictum claims that Henry III&#x27;s 1052 invasion of Hungary was defeated by a skillful diver who sabotaged Henry&#x27;s supply fleet. The unexpected sinking of the ships is confirmed by German chronicles.
On 4 November 1918, during World War I, Italian frogmen sunk the Austro-Hungarian ship &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot;.

Italy started World War II with a commando frogman force already trained. Britain, Germany, the United States, and the Soviet Union started commando frogman forces during World War II.

===First frogmen===
The word &quot;frogman&quot; appeared first in the stage name &quot;The Fearless Frogman&quot; of Paul Boyton, who since the 1870s broke records in long distance swimming to demonstrate a newly invented rubber immersion suit, with an inflated hood.

The first modern frogmen were the World War II Italian commando frogmen of &quot;Decima Flottiglia MAS&quot; (now &quot;ComSubIn&quot;: Comando Raggruppamento Subacquei e Incursori Teseo Tesei) which formed in 1938 and was first in action in 1940. Originally these divers were called &quot;&quot;Uomini Gamma&quot; because they were members of the top secret special unit called &quot;Gruppo Gamma&quot;, which originated from the kind of Pirelli rubber skin-suit nicknamed &quot;muta gamma&quot; used by these divers. Later they were nicknamed &quot;Uomini Rana&quot;,&quot; Italian for &quot;frog men&quot;, because of an underwater swimming frog kick style, similar to that of frogs, or because their fins looked like frog&#x27;s feet.

This special corps used an early oxygen rebreather scuba set, the &quot;Auto Respiratore ad Ossigeno&quot; (A.R.O), a development of the Dräger oxygen self-contained breathing apparatus designed for the mining industry and of the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus made by Siebe, Gorman &amp; Co and by Bergomi, designed for escaping from sunken submarines. This was used from about 1920 for spearfishing by Italian sport divers, modified and adapted by the Italian navy engineers for safe underwater use and built by Pirelli and SALVAS from about 1933, and so became a precursor of the modern diving rebreather.

For this new way of underwater diving, the Italian frogmen trained in La Spezia, Liguria, using the newly available Genoese free diving spearfishing equipment; diving mask, snorkel, swimfins, and rubber dry suit, the first specially made diving watch (the luminescent Panerai), and the new A.R.O. scuba unit. This was a revolutionary alternative way to dive, and the start of the transition from the usual heavy underwater diving equipment of the hard hat divers which had been in general use since the 18th century, to self-contained divers, free of being tethered by an air line and rope connection.

===Wartime operations===
After Italy declared war, the &quot;Decima Flottiglia MAS&quot; (&quot;Xª MAS&quot;) attempted several frogmen attacks on British naval bases in the Mediterranean between June 1940 and July 1941, but none were successful, because of equipment failure or early detection by British forces. On September 10, 1941, eight &quot;Xª MAS&quot; frogmen were inserted by submarine close to the British harbour at Gibraltar, where using human torpedoes to penetrate the defences, sank three merchant ships before escaping through neutral Spain. An even more successful attack, the Raid on Alexandria, was mounted on 19 December on the harbour at Alexandria, again using human torpedoes. The raid resulted in disabling the battleships and together with a destroyer and an oil tanker, but all six frogmen were captured. Frogmen were deployed by stealth in Algeciras, Spain, from where they launched a number of limpet-mine attacks on Allied shipping at anchor off Gibraltar. Some time later they refitted the interned Italian tanker &quot;Olterra&quot; as a mothership for human torpedoes, carrying out three assaults on ships at Gibraltar between late 1942 and early 1943, sinking six of them.

Nazi Germany raised a number of frogmen units under the auspices of both the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, often relying on Italian expertise and equipment. In June 1944, a &quot;K-Verband&quot; frogman unit failed to destroy the bridge at Bénouville, now known as Pegasus Bridge, during the Battle of Normandy. In March 1945, a frogman squad from the Brandenburgers was deployed from their base in Venice to destroy the Ludendorff Bridge over the Rhine which had been captured by the US Army in the Battle of Remagen. Seven frogmen swam downriver to the bridge carrying explosives, but were spotted by Canal Defence Lights. Four died, two from hypothermia, and the rest were captured.

The British Royal Navy had captured an Italian human torpedo during a failed attack on Malta; they developed a copy called the Chariot and formed a unit called the Experimental Submarine Flotilla, which later merged with the Special Boat Service. A number of Chariot operations were attempted, most notably Operation Title in October 1942, an attack on the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, which had to be abandoned when a storm hit the fishing boat which was towing the Chariots into position. Operation Principal in January 1943 was an attack by eight Chariots on La Maddalena and Palermo harbours; although all the Chariots were lost, the new Italian cruiser &quot;Ulpio Traiano&quot; was sunk. The last and most successful British operation resulted in sinking two liners in Phuket harbour in Thailand in October 1944. Royal Navy divers did not use fins until December 1942.

===Wartime developments===
In 1933 Italian companies were already producing underwater oxygen rebreathers, but the first diving set known as SCUBA was invented in 1939 by Christian Lambertsen, who originally called it the Lambertsen Amphibious Respirator Unit (LARU) and patented it in 1940. He later renamed it the Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus, which, contracted to SCUBA, eventually became the generic term for both open circuit and rebreather autonomous underwater breathing equipment.

Lambertsen demonstrated it to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) (after already being rejected by the U.S. Navy) in a pool at a hotel in Washington D.C. OSS not only bought into the concept, they hired Lambertsen to lead the program and build up the dive element of their Maritime Unit. The OSS was the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency; the maritime element still exists inside the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division.

John Spence, an enlisted member of the U.S. Navy, was the first man selected to join the OSS group.

===Postwar operations===
In April 1956, Commander Lionel Crabb, a wartime pioneer of Royal Navy combat diving, disappeared during a covert inspection of the hull of the Soviet Navy , , while she was moored in Portsmouth Harbour.

The Shayetet 13 commandos of the Israeli Navy have carried out a number of underwater raids on harbors. They were initially trained by veterans of &quot;Xª MAS&quot; and used Italian equipment. As part of Operation Raviv in 1969, eight frogmen used two human torpedoes to enter Ras Sadat naval base near Suez, where they destroyed two motor torpedo boats with mines.

During the 1982 Falklands War, the Argentinian Naval Intelligence Service planned an attack on British warships at Gibraltar. Code named Operation Algeciras, three frogmen, recruited from a former anti-government insurgent group, were to plant mines on the ships&#x27; hulls. The operation was abandoned when the divers were arrested by Spanish police and deported.

In 1985, the French nuclear weapons tests at Moruroa in the Pacific Ocean was being contested by environmental protesters led by the Greenpeace campaign ship, . The Action Division of the French Directorate-General for External Security devised a plan to sink the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; while it was berthed in harbor at Auckland in New Zealand. Two divers from the Division posed as tourists and attached two limpet mines to the ship&#x27;s hull; the resulting explosion sank the ship and killed a Netherlands citizen on board. Two agents from the team, but not the divers, were arrested by the New Zealand Police and later convicted of manslaughter. The French government finally admitted responsibility two months later.

In the U.S. Navy, frogmen were officially phased out in 1983 and all active duty frogmen were transferred to SEAL units. In 1989, during the U.S. invasion of Panama, a team of four U.S. Navy SEALs using rebreathers conducted a combat swimmer attack on the &quot;Presidente Porras&quot;, a gunboat and yacht belonging to Manuel Noriega. The commandos attached explosives to the vessel as it was tied to a pier in the Panama Canal, escaping only after being attacked with grenades. Three years later during Operation Restore Hope, members of SEAL Team One swam to shore in Somalia to measure beach composition, water depth, and shore gradient ahead of a Marine landing. The mission resulted in several of the SEALs becoming ill as Somalia&#x27;s waters were contaminated with raw sewage.

In 1978, the U.S. Navy Special Operations Officer (1140) community was established by combining Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and Expendable Ordnance Management officers with Diving and Salvage officers. Special Ops Officers would become qualified in at lease two functional areas - normally EOD or Diving and Salvage, and Expendable Ordnance management. Officers trained in diving and salvage techniques were now allowed to follow a career pattern that took advantage of their training, and Unrestricted line officers were now permitted to specialize in salvage, with repeat tours of duty, and advanced training. Career patterns were developed to ensure that officers assigned to command were seasoned in salvage operations and well qualified in the technical aspects of their trade. &quot;The combination gave a breadth and depth of professionalism to Navy salvage that had not been possible before.&quot;

<text>This is a list of beaches of the world, sorted by country. A beach is a landform along the shoreline of an ocean, sea, lake, or river. It usually consists of loose particles, which are often composed of rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, or cobblestones. Beaches typically occur in areas along the coast where wave or current action deposits and reworks sediments. The particles comprising a beach are occasionally biological in origin, such as mollusc shells or coralline algae.

<doc id="297117" wikidata="Q209569" url="?curid=297117" title="Hydrofluoric acid">
<text>Hydrofluoric acid is a solution of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in water. Solutions of HF are colorless, acidic and highly corrosive. A common concentration is 49% (48-52%) but there are also stronger solutions (e.g. 70%) and pure HF has a boiling point near room temperature. It is used to make most fluorine-containing compounds; examples include the commonly used pharmaceutical antidepressant medication fluoxetine (Prozac) and the material PTFE (Teflon). Elemental fluorine is produced from it. It is commonly used to etch glass and silicon wafers.

==Uses==
===Production of organofluorine compounds===
The principal use of hydrofluoric acid is in organofluorine chemistry. Many organofluorine compounds are prepared using HF as the fluorine source, including Teflon, fluoropolymers, fluorocarbons, and refrigerants such as freon. Many pharmaceuticals contain fluorine.

===Production of inorganic fluorides===
Most high-volume inorganic fluoride compounds are prepared from hydrofluoric acid. Foremost are Na3AlF6, cryolite, and AlF3, aluminium trifluoride. A molten mixture of these solids serves as a high-temperature solvent for the production of metallic aluminium. Other inorganic fluorides prepared from hydrofluoric acid include sodium fluoride and uranium hexafluoride.

===Etchant, cleaner===

It is used in the semiconductor industry as a major component of Wright etch and buffered oxide etch, which are used to clean silicon wafers. In a similar manner it is also used to etch glass by treatment with silicon dioxide to form gaseous or water-soluble silicon fluorides. It can also be used to polish and frost glass.

:SiO2 + 4 HF → SiF4(g) + 2 H2O
:SiO2 + 6 HF → H2SiF6 + 2 H2O

A 5% to 9% hydrofluoric acid gel is also commonly used to etch all ceramic dental restorations to improve bonding. For similar reasons, dilute hydrofluoric acid is a component of household rust stain remover, in car washes in &quot;wheel cleaner&quot; compounds, in ceramic and fabric rust inhibitors, and in water spot removers. Because of its ability to dissolve iron oxides as well as silica-based contaminants, hydrofluoric acid is used in pre-commissioning boilers that produce high-pressure steam. Hydrofluoric acid is also useful for dissolving rock samples (usually powdered) prior to analysis. In similar manner, this acid is used in acid macerations to extract organic fossils from silicate rocks. Fossiliferous rock may be immersed directly into the acid, or a cellulose nitrate film may be applied (dissolved in amyl acetate), which adheres to the organic component and allows the rock to be dissolved around it.

===Oil refining===
In a standard oil refinery process known as alkylation, isobutane is alkylated with low-molecular-weight alkenes (primarily a mixture of propylene and butylene) in the presence of an acid catalyst derived from hydrofluoric acid. The catalyst protonates the alkenes (propylene, butylene) to produce reactive carbocations, which alkylate isobutane. The reaction is carried out at mild temperatures (0 and 30 °C) in a two-phase reaction.

==Production==

Hydrofluoric acid was first prepared in 1771, by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. It is now mainly produced by treatment of the mineral fluorite, CaF2, with concentrated sulfuric acid at approximately 265 °C.

:CaF2 + H2SO4 → 2 HF + CaSO4

The acid is also a by-product of the production of phosphoric acid from apatite and fluoroapatite. Digestion of the mineral with sulfuric acid at elevated temperatures releases a mixture of gases, including hydrogen fluoride, which may be recovered.

Because of its high reactivity toward glass, hydrofluoric acid is stored in fluorinated plastic (often PTFE) containers.

==Properties==

In dilute aqueous solution hydrogen fluoride behaves as a weak acid,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearson/Prentice Hall&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Infrared spectroscopy has been used to show that, in solution, dissociation is accompanied by formation of the ion pair ·F−.

: + HF ⋅F−p&quot;K&quot;a = 3.17
This ion pair has been characterized in the crystalline state at very low temperature. 
Further association has been characterized both in solution and in the solid state.
:HF + F− log &quot;K&quot; = 0.6

It is assumed that polymerization occurs as the concentration increases. This assumption is supported by the isolation of a salt of a tetrameric anion and by low-temperature X-ray crystallography. The species that are present in concentrated aqueous solutions of hydrogen fluoride have not all been characterized; in addition to which is known the formation of other polymeric species, , is highly likely.

The Hammett acidity function, &quot;H&quot;0, for 100% HF was first reported as -10.2, while later compilations show -11, comparable to values near -12 for pure sulfuric acid.

==Acidity==
Unlike other hydrohalic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrogen fluoride is only a weak acid in dilute aqueous solution. This is in part a result of the strength of the hydrogen–fluorine bond, but also of other factors such as the tendency of HF, , and anions to form clusters. At high concentrations, HF molecules undergo homoassociation to form polyatomic ions (such as bifluoride, ) and protons, thus greatly increasing the acidity. This leads to protonation of very strong acids like hydrochloric, sulfuric, or nitric acids when using concentrated hydrofluoric acid solutions. Although hydrofluoric acid is regarded as a weak acid, it is very corrosive, even attacking glass when hydrated.

Dilute solutions are weakly acidic with an acid ionization constant (or ), in contrast to corresponding solutions of the other hydrogen halides, which are strong acids (). However concentrated solutions of hydrogen fluoride are much more strongly acidic than implied by this value, as shown by measurements of the Hammett acidity function &quot;H&quot;0(or &quot;effective pH&quot;). During self ionization of 100% liquid HF the &quot;H&quot;0 was first measured as −10.2 and later compiled as −11, comparable to values near −12 for sulfuric acid.

In thermodynamic terms, HF solutions are highly non-ideal, with the activity of HF increasing much more rapidly than its concentration.
The weak acidity in dilute solution is sometimes attributed to the high H—F bond strength, which combines with the high dissolution enthalpy of HF to outweigh the more negative enthalpy of hydration of the fluoride ion. Paul Giguère and Sylvia Turrell have shown by infrared spectroscopy that the predominant solute species in dilute solution is the hydrogen-bonded ion pair ·F−.

: + HF ⋅F−

With increasing concentration of HF the concentration of the hydrogen difluoride ion also increases. The reaction 
:3 HF + H2F+
is an example of homoconjugation.

==Health and safety==


In addition to being a highly corrosive liquid, hydrofluoric acid is also a powerful contact poison. Since it can penetrate tissue, poisoning can occur readily through exposure of skin or eyes, inhalation, or ingestion. Symptoms of exposure to hydrofluoric acid may not be immediately evident, and this can provide false reassurance to victims, causing them to delay medical treatment. Despite its irritating vapor, HF may reach dangerous levels without an obvious odor. It interferes with nerve function, meaning that burns may not initially be painful. Accidental exposures can go unnoticed, delaying treatment and increasing the extent and seriousness of the injury. Symptoms of HF exposure include irritation of the eyes, skin, nose, and throat, eye and skin burns, rhinitis, bronchitis, pulmonary edema (fluid buildup in the lungs), and bone damage due to HF strongly interacting with calcium in bones. In a concentrated form, HF can cause severe tissue destruction through lesions and mucous membrane damage, but dilute HF is still dangerous because of its high lipid affinity, leading to cellular death of nerves, blood vessels, tendons, bones, and other tissues.

Hydrofluoric burns are treated with a calcium gluconate gel.

==In popular culture==
*In the episodes &quot;Cat&#x27;s in the Bag...&quot; and &quot;Box Cutter&quot; of the crime drama television series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, Walter White and Jesse Pinkman use hydrofluoric acid to chemically disincorporate bodies of gangsters.
* In Season 4 epsiode 20 &quot;Of Past Regret and Future Fear&quot; of the television medical drama &quot;ER&quot;, a patient is brought in with severe chemical burns from hydrofluoric acid that prove to be fatal.

<doc id="297124" wikidata="Q903941" url="?curid=297124" title="Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program">
<text>The Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Project (BPP) was a research project funded by NASA from 1996 to 2002 to study various proposals for revolutionary methods of spacecraft propulsion that would require breakthroughs in physics before they could be realized. The project ended in 2002, when the Advanced Space Transportation Program was reorganized and all speculative research (less than Technology readiness level 3) was cancelled.
During its six years of operational funding, this program received a total investment of $1.2 million. 

The Breakthrough Propulsion Physics project addressed a selection of &quot;incremental and affordable&quot; research questions towards the overall goal of propellantless propulsion, hyperfast travel, and breakthrough propulsion methods. It selected and funded five external projects, two in-house tasks and one
minor grant.
At the end of the project, conclusions into fourteen topics, including these funded projects, were summarized by program manager Marc G. Millis. Of these, six research avenues were found to be nonviable, four were identified as opportunities for continued research, and four remain unresolved.

==Non-viable approaches==
One in-house experiment tested the Schlicher thruster antenna, claimed by Schlicher to generate thrust. No thrust was observed.

Another experiment examined a gravity shielding mechanism claimed by Podkletnov and Nieminen. Experimental investigation on the BPPP and other experiments found no evidence of the effect.

Research on quantum tunneling was sponsored by the BPPP. It was concluded that this is not a mechanism for faster-than-light travel.

Other approaches categorized as non-viable are oscillation thrusters and gyroscopic antigravity, Hooper antigravity coils, and coronal blowers.

==Unresolved approaches==
A theoretical examination of additional atomic energy levels (deep Dirac levels) was carried out. Some states were ruled out, but the problem remains unsolved.

Experiments tested Woodward’s theory of inducing transient inertia by electromagnetic fields. The small effect could not be confirmed. Woodward continued refining the experiments and theory. Independent experiments also remained inconclusive.

A possible torsion-like effect in the coupling between electromagnetism and spacetime, which may ultimately be useful for propulsion, was sought in experiments. The experiments were insufficient to resolve the question.

Other theories listed in Millis&#x27;s final assessment as unresolved are Abraham–Minkowski electromagnetic momentum, interpreting inertia and gravity quantum vacuum effects, and the Podkletnov force beam.

== Space drives ==
One of the eight tasks funded by the BPP program was to define a strategy towards space drives. 

As a motivation, seven examples of hypothetical space drives were described at the onset of the project. These included the gravity-based pitch drive, bias drive, disjunction drive and diametric drive; the Alcubierre drive; and the vacuum energy based differential sail.

The project then considered the mechanisms behind these drives. At the end of the project, three mechanisms were identified as areas for future research. One considers the possibility of a reaction mass in seemingly empty space, for example in dark matter, dark energy, or zero-point energy. Another approach is to reconsider Mach&#x27;s principle and Euclidean space. A third research avenue that might ultimately prove useful for spacecraft propulsion is the coupling of fundamental forces on sub-atomic scales.

== Quantum vacuum energy experiments == 

One topic of investigations was the use of the zero-point energy field. As the Heisenberg uncertainty principle implies that there is no such thing as an exact amount of energy in an exact location, vacuum fluctuations are known to lead to discernible effects such as the Casimir effect. The differential sail is a speculative drive, based on the possibility of inducing differences in the pressure of vacuum fluctuations on either side of a sail-like structure — with the pressure being somehow reduced on the forward surface of the sail, but pushing as normal on the aft surface — and thus propel a vehicle forward.

The Casimir effect was investigated experimentally and analytically under the Breakthrough Propulsion Physics project. This included the construction of MicroElectroMechanical
(MEM) rectangular Casimir cavities. Theoretical work showed that the effect could be used to create net forces, although the forces would be extremely small. At the conclusion of the project, the Casimir effect was categorized as an avenue for future research.

==Tau Zero Foundation==

After funding ended, program manager Marc G. Millis was supported by NASA to complete documentation of results. The book &quot;Frontiers of Propulsion Science&quot; was published by the AIAA in February 2009, providing a deeper explanation of several propulsion methods.

Following program cancellation in 2002, Millis and others founded the Tau Zero Foundation.

<doc id="297127" wikidata="Q470135" url="?curid=297127" title="Baba Amte">
<text>Murlidhar Devidas Amte (), popularly known as Baba Amte, (26 December 1914 – 9 February 2008) was an Indian social worker and social activist known particularly for his work for the rehabilitation and empowerment of people suffering from leprosy. He has received numerous awards and prizes including the Padma Vibhushan, the Dr. Ambedkar International Award, the Gandhi Peace Prize, the Ramon Magsaysay Award, the Templeton Prize and the Jamnalal Bajaj Award. He is also known as the modern Gandhi of India.

== Early life ==
Murlidhar Devidas &quot;Baba&quot; Amte was born in an affluent Deshastha Brahmin family on 26 December 1914 in the city of Hinganghat in Maharashtra. His father, Devidas Amte, was. a colonial government officer working for the district administration and revenue collection departments. Murlidhar Amte acquired the nickname &quot;Baba&quot; in his childhood. His wife, Sadhanatai Amte, explains that he came to be known as Baba not because &quot;he was regarded as a saint or a holy person, but because his parents addressed him by that name.&quot;

Amte was the eldest of eight children. As the eldest son of a wealthy land owner, he had an idyllic childhood, filled with hunting and sports. By the time he was fourteen, he owned his own gun and hunted bear and deer. When he was old enough to drive, he was given a Singer Sports car with cushions covered with panther skin. Though he was born in a wealthy family he was always aware of the class inequality that prevailed in Indian society. &quot;There is a certain callousness in families like my family,&quot; he used to say. &quot;They put up strong barriers so as to avoid seeing the misery in the outside world and I rebelled against it.&quot;

== Dedicated works ==
Trained in law, he developed a successful legal practice in Wardha. He soon became involved in the Indian independence movement and, in 1942, began working as a defense lawyer for Indian leaders imprisoned by the colonial government for their involvement in the Quit India movement. He spent some time at Sevagram, at the ashram started by Mahatma Gandhi and became a follower of Gandhism. He practiced Gandhism by engaging in yarn spinning using a charkha and wearing khadi. When Gandhi got to know that Dr. Amte had defended a girl from the lewd taunts of some British soldiers, Gandhi gave him the name – &quot;Abhay Sadhak&quot; (Fearless Seeker of Truth).

However one day his encounter with a living corpse and leprosy patient Tulshiram, filled him with fear. Amte, who never feared for anything till that incident and who fought one time with British men to save the honour of an Indian lady and was also challenged by sweepers of Warora to clean the gutters, was quivered in fright on seeing plight of Tulshiram. However, Amte wanted to create a thinking and understanding that leprosy patients can be truly helped only when a society is free of &quot;Mental Leprosy&quot;-fear and wrong understanding associated with disease. To dispel this thinking he once injected himself with bacilli from a patient, to prove the ailment was not highly contagious. In those days, people with leprosy suffered a social stigma and Indian society disowned these people. Amte strove to dispel the widespread belief that leprosy was highly contagious; he even allowed bacilli from a leper to be injected into him as part of an experiment aimed at proving that leprosy was not highly contagious. But Baba Amte and his wife used to prioritise the care and treatment and mainstreaming those affected by the dreaded disease of leprosy and lived amongst the affected and ensured that they got exemplary medical care which ended the scourge of the disease for them. For the rehabilitated and cured patients he arranged vocational training and small-scale manufacturing of handicrafts and got things crafted by them. He struggled and tried to remove the stigma and ignorance surrounding the treatment of leprosy as a disease.

Amte founded three ashrams for treatment and rehabilitation of leprosy patients, disabled people and people from marginalised sections of general society in Maharashtra. On 15 August 1949, he and his wife Sadhna Amte started a leprosy hospital in Anandvan under a tree. The leprosy patients were provided with medical care and a life of dignity engaged in agriculture and various small and medium industries like handicrafts. In 1973, Amte founded the Lok Biradari Prakalp to work for the Madia Gond tribal people of Gadchiroli District. Baba Amte also involved in other social cause initiatives like, in year 1985 he launched the first Knit India Mission for peace-at 72 years he walked from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, a distance of more than 3000 miles, to inspire unity among Indian people and organised second march three years later travelling over 1800 miles from Assam to Gujarat. He also participated in Narmada Bachao Andolan in year 1990, leaving Anandwan and lived on banks of Narmada for seven years.

Amte devoted his life to many other social causes, most notably the Quit India movement and attempting to raise public awareness on the importance of ecological balance, wildlife preservation and the Narmada Bachao Andolan. The Indian Government awarded Baba Amte with a Padma Shri in 1971.

== Dedicated works of family members ==
Amte married Indu Ghuleshastri (later called Sadhanatai Amte). She participated in her husband&#x27;s social work with equal dedication. Their two sons, Vikas Amte and Prakash Amte, and daughters-in-law, Mandakini and Bharati, are doctors. All four dedicated their lives to social work and causes similar to those of the senior Amte. Prakash and his wife Mandakini run a school and a hospital at Hemalkasa village in the underprivileged district of Gadchiroli in Maharashtra among the Madia Gond tribe, as well as an orphanage for injured wild animals, including a lion and some leopards. She left her governmental medical and moved to Hemalkasa to start the projects after they married. Their two sons, Dr. Digant and Aniket also dedicated their lives to the same causes. In 2008, Prakash and Mandakini received the Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership.

Amte&#x27;s elder son Vikas and his wife Bharati run the hospital at Anandwan and co-ordinate operations with satellite projects. Anandwan has a university, an orphanage, and schools for the blind and the deaf. The Anandwan ashram is self-sufficient and has over 5,000 residents. Amte later founded &quot;Somnath&quot; and &quot;Ashokwan&quot; ashrams for people suffering from leprosy.

== Gandhism ==
Amte followed Gandhi&#x27;s way of life and led a spartan life. He wore khadi clothes made from the looms at Anandwan. He believed in Gandhi&#x27;s concept of a self-sufficient village industry that empowers seemingly helpless people, and successfully brought his ideas into practice at Anandwan. Using non-violent means, he played an important role in the struggle for the independence of India. Amte also used Gandhi&#x27;s principles to fight against corruption, mismanagement, and poor, shortsighted planning in the government. However, Amte never disowned God. He used to say that if there are hundred thousands of universes then God must be very busy. Let us do our work on our own.

== Narmada Bachao Andolan with Medha Patkar ==
In 1990, Amte left Anandwan for a while to live along the Narmada River and joined &quot;Narmada Bachao Andolan&quot; (&quot;Save Narmada&quot;) movement one of whose popular leaders was Medha Patkar, which fought against both unjust displacement of local inhabitants and damage to the environment due to the construction of the Sardar Sarovar dam on the Narmada river.

==Death==
Amte died at Anandwan on 9 February 2008 in Maharashtra of age-related illnesses. By choosing to get buried than cremated he followed the principles he preached as environmentalist and social reformer.

== Quotes ==
* &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be a great leader; I want to be a man who goes around with a little oilcan and when he sees a breakdown, offers his help. To me, the man who does that is greater than any holy man in saffron-coloured robes. The mechanic with the oilcan: that is my ideal in life.&quot; (Self-description given to British journalist Graham Turner)
* &quot;I took up leprosy work not to help anyone, but to overcome that fear in my life. That it worked out good for others was a by-product. But the fact is I did it to overcome fear.&quot;

== Further reading ==
In her 2015 book Strangers Drowning, Larissa MacFarquhar profiled Amte as one of the extremely altruistic people she classifies as &quot;do-gooders&quot;.
