<text>John Watts Young (September 24, 1930 – January 5, 2018) was an American astronaut, naval officer and aviator, test pilot, and aeronautical engineer. He became the 9th person to walk on the Moon as commander of the Apollo 16 mission in 1972. He is the only astronaut to fly on four different classes of spacecraft: Gemini, the Apollo command and service module, the Apollo Lunar Module and the Space Shuttle.

Before becoming an astronaut, Young received his Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology and joined the U.S. Navy. After serving at sea during the Korean War he became a naval aviator and graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. As a test pilot, he set several world time-to-climb records. Young retired from the Navy in 1976 with the rank of captain.

In 1962, Young was selected as a member of NASA Astronaut Group 2. He flew on the first crewed Gemini mission (Gemini 3) in 1965, and then commanded the 1966 Gemini 10 mission. In 1969, he flew as command module pilot on Apollo 10, and became the first person to orbit the Moon alone. In 1972, he commanded Apollo 16 and spent three days on the lunar surface exploring the Descartes Highlands with Charles Duke. Young also commanded STS-1 in 1981, the Space Shuttle program&#x27;s first launch, and STS-9 in 1983, both of which were on . He was one of only two astronauts, along with Ken Mattingly, his command module pilot during the Apollo 16 mission, to fly on both an Apollo mission and a Space Shuttle mission, and the only astronaut to walk on the Moon and fly on the Space Shuttle. Young served as Chief of the Astronaut Office from 1974 to 1987, and retired from NASA in 2004, after 42 years of service.

== Early years and education ==
John Watts Young was born at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in San Francisco, California, on September 24, 1930, to William Hugh Young, a civil engineer, and Wanda Young (). His father lost his job during the Great Depression, and the family moved to Cartersville, Georgia, in 1932. In 1936, the family moved to Orlando, Florida, where he attended Princeton Elementary School. When Young was five years old, his mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and taken to Florida State Hospital. Soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Young&#x27;s father joined the U.S. Navy as a Seabee and left Young and his younger brother Hugh in the care of a housekeeper. Young&#x27;s father returned after the war and became a plant superintendent for a citrus company. Young attended Orlando High School, where he competed in football, baseball, and track and field, before he graduated in 1948.

Young attended the Georgia Institute of Technology on a Naval ROTC scholarship. He completed a midshipman cruise aboard , where he worked alongside his future Apollo 10 crewmate Thomas P. Stafford, and another aboard . His senior year, Young served as regiment commander of his ROTC detachment. He was a member of the honor societies Scabbard and Blade, Tau Beta Pi, Omicron Delta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, ANAK Society, and the Sigma Chi fraternity. In 1952, Young graduated second in his class with a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering and was commissioned as an ensign in the U.S. Navy on June 6, 1952.

== Navy service ==
Young applied to become a naval aviator, but was selected to become a gunnery officer aboard out of Naval Base San Diego. He completed a Pacific deployment as a fire control and division officer on &quot;Laws&quot; in the Sea of Japan during the Korean War. In May 1953, he received orders to flight school at Naval Air Station Pensacola. Young first flew the SNJ-5 Texan in flight school and was then selected for helicopter training. He flew the HTL-5 and HUP-2 helicopters and completed helicopter training in January 1954. Young returned to flying the SNJ-5, and advanced to fly the T-28 Trojan, F6F Hellcat, and the F9F Panther. He graduated from flight school and received his aviator wings in December 1954.

After flight school, Young was assigned to Fighter Squadron 103 (VF-103) at NAS Cecil Field to fly the F9F Cougar. In August 1956, he deployed with the Sixth Fleet aboard to the Mediterranean Sea. Young flew during the Suez Crisis, but did not fly in combat. His squadron returned in February 1957, and later that year began the transition to fly the F8U Crusader. In September 1958, VF-103 deployed with the Sixth Fleet on to the Mediterranean Sea. In January 1959, Young was selected to be in Class 23 at the United States Naval Test Pilot School and returned home from deployment.

In 1959, Young graduated second in his class and was assigned to the Armament Division at the Naval Air Test Center. He worked alongside future astronaut James A. Lovell Jr. and tested the F-4 Phantom II fighter weapons systems. In 1962, he set two world time-to-climb records in the F-4, reaching in 34.52 seconds and in 227.6 seconds. In 1962, Young was assigned to fly with Fighter Squadron 143 (VF-143) until his selection as an astronaut in September 1962.

Young retired from the Navy as a captain in September 1976. He had 24 years of service.

== NASA career ==
In September 1962, Young was selected to join NASA Astronaut Group 2. Young and his family moved to Houston, Texas, and he began his astronaut flying, physical, and academic training. After he completed his initial training, Young was assigned to work on the environmental control system and survivor gear. Young&#x27;s team selected the David Clark Company G3C pressure suit, and he helped develop the waste disposal and airlock development systems.

=== Project Gemini ===
==== Gemini 3 ====

In April 1964, Young was selected as the pilot of Gemini 3, commanded by Gus Grissom. The crew had originally been Alan Shepard and Thomas P. Stafford, but they were replaced after Shepard was diagnosed with Ménière&#x27;s disease. The Gemini 3 backup commander was Wally Schirra, with Stafford as the backup pilot. The primary mission of Gemini 3 was to test the ability of the spacecraft to perform orbital maneuvers throughout the flight. Biological experiments were assigned to test the effects of radiation on human blood and microgravity on cell division, and an experiment to test reentry communications was created. Both crews initially trained in simulators at the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation facilities in St. Louis, Missouri, and moved their training when the simulators were set up at the Manned Spacecraft Center and Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in October 1964. Both primary and backup crews participated in Gemini 3&#x27;s capsule system tests before it left the McDonnell facility. The capsule was brought to the Kennedy Space Center on January 4, 1965, and both crews trained in it from February 14 to March 18. Young advocated for a longer mission than the planned three orbits, but his suggestion was rejected.

On March 23, 1965, Young and Grissom entered their capsule at 7:30 a.m. They conducted their preflight system checkout ahead of schedule but had to delay the launch after there was a leak in an oxidizer line in the Titan II GLV. Gemini 3 launched at 9:24 a.m. from LC-19 and entered in a elliptical orbit. Twenty minutes into flight, Young recognized multiple anomalous system readings and determined that there might be issues with the instrument power supply. He switched from the primary power supply to the backup, which solved the issue. Young successfully completed the radiation experiment on human blood, but Grissom accidentally broke a handle and was unable to complete his assigned experiment on cell division. Gemini 3 successfully conducted its orbital maneuver tests that allowed it to circularize its orbit, change its orbital plane, and lower its perigee to . On the third orbit, Young fired the retrorockets to begin re-entry. The lift the capsule experienced during reentry was less than predicted, and Gemini 3 landed short of its target area. After the parachutes deployed, the crew shifted the capsule to its landing orientation, which caused both of them to be thrown forward into the windshield and damaged the faceplates on their helmets. The crew remained inside the capsule for 30 minutes as they waited for a helicopter to retrieve them, and they and the capsule were successfully recovered aboard . After the flight, it was discovered that Young had smuggled a corned beef sandwich aboard, which he and Grissom shared while testing food. The House Committee on Appropriations launched a hearing regarding the incident, and some members argued that the two astronauts had disrupted the scheduled food test.

==== Gemini 10 ====

After Gemini 3, Grissom and Young were assigned as backup commander and pilot for Gemini 6. On January 24, 1966, Young and Michael Collins were assigned as the Gemini 10 commander and pilot, with Alan L. Bean and Clifton C. Williams Jr. as the backup crew. The primary mission of Gemini 10 was to dock with an Agena target vehicle (ATV) and use its engines to maneuver. Using the Agena engines to maneuver had been a failed objective of Gemini 8 and Gemini 9. The mission planned for Gemini 10 to dock with its assigned Agena target vehicle and then maneuver to rendezvous with the already orbiting Agena that had been previously assigned to Gemini 8. In the event of a failure of Gemini 10&#x27;s target vehicle, the mission would still launch and attempt a rendezvous with Gemini 8&#x27;s target vehicle.

The Agena target vehicle was launched on July 18, 1966, at 3:39 p.m. and successfully entered orbit. Gemini 10 launched as scheduled later that day at 5:20 p.m. from LC-19, within the 35-second launch window that maximized its chances of making the dual rendezvous. Once in orbit, the crew attempted to navigate to their first rendezvous using celestial navigation, but were unable to navigate and required inputs from Mission Control. Young maneuvered to a orbit to prepare for the rendezvous, and he had to make two midcourse corrections due to misalignment during the maneuver burns. Gemini 10 successfully rendezvoused and docked with the Agena target vehicle at 11:12 p.m. The higher-than-expected fuel consumption during the midcourse corrections caused flight director Glynn Lunney to cancel planned additional docking practice once the capsule had completed its rendezvous. Using the Agena&#x27;s engines, Gemini 10 maneuvered to a elliptical orbit, which set a new altitude record for a crewed vehicle at the apogee. Gemini 10 used the rockets on the Agena to maneuver and rendezvous with the Gemini 8 Agena and set another new altitude record of . Young fired the Agena engines to lower the apogee to , and later circularized the orbit with another burn to raise the perigee to , which was below the Gemini8 Agena. Collins performed a standup extravehicular activity (EVA) where he stood at the door of the Gemini capsule to photograph the southern Milky Way to study its ultraviolet radiation. He began a color photography experiment but did not finish it as his and Young&#x27;s eyes began filling with tears due to irritation from the anti-fog compound in their helmets.

Gemini 10 undocked from its Agena and performed two maneuvers to rendezvous with the Gemini 8 Agena. Gemini 10 successfully rendezvoused with its second target vehicle 47 hours into the mission, and Young accomplished station keeping to keep the capsule approximately from the Agena vehicle. Collins conducted an EVA to retrieve a micrometeorite experiment package. After he handed the package to Young, Collins extended his umbilical to test his maneuverability using a nitrogen gun, but struggled with it and pulled himself back to the capsule with his umbilical cable. The crew maneuvered away from the Agena and lowered their perigee to . Young conducted the retrofire burn and manually flew the reentry. The capsule landed from their recovery ship, , in the western Atlantic Ocean on July 21, 1966, at 4:07 p.m. After the crew was recovered and aboard the ship, flight controllers completed several burns on the Agena target vehicle to put it in a circular orbit to be used as a target for future missions.

=== Apollo program ===
==== Apollo 10 ====

Young was originally assigned as backup to the second crewed Apollo mission, along with Thomas P. Stafford and Eugene A. Cernan. After the delays caused by the fatal Apollo 1 fire in January 1967, Young, Cernan, and Stafford were assigned as the Apollo 7 backup crew. On November 13, 1968, NASA announced that the Apollo 10 crew would be commanded by Stafford, with Young as command module pilot and Cernan as the lunar module pilot. The backup crew was L. Gordon Cooper Jr., Donn F. Eisele, and Edgar D. Mitchell. Apollo 10 would be the only F-type mission, which entailed crewed entry into lunar orbit and testing of the lunar module, but without a landing. It would serve as a final test for the procedures and hardware before the first lunar landing. During flight preparation, the crew spent over 300 hours in simulators, both at the Manned Spacecraft Center and at Cape Kennedy. Mission Control linked with Young in the command module simulator and Stafford and Cernan in the lunar module simulator to provide realistic training. The crew selected the call sign &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; for the command module and &quot;Snoopy&quot; for the lunar module, in reference to the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip by Charles M. Schulz.

On May 18, 1969, Apollo 10 launched at 11:49 a.m. After the trans-lunar injection (TLI) burn, Young successfully docked the command module with the lunar module. Young took celestial navigation measurements while en route to the Moon as a contingency for a loss of communication. Apollo 10 completed one midcourse correction, and Young performed the retrograde maneuver to bring the spacecraft into orbit above the lunar surface. On May 22, Stafford and Cernan entered the lunar module but were concerned that the docking ports&#x27; alignment had slipped by 3.5°. Apollo Program Spacecraft manager George M. Low determined that it was within acceptable limits, and the two spacecraft undocked. Young examined the lunar module after the two spacecraft were separated by and then maneuvered the command module away. Stafford and Cernan began their descent and flew the lunar module down to above the lunar surface. The lunar module crew tested the abort guidance system but had accidentally changed its setting from &quot;attitude hold&quot; to &quot;automatic&quot;. As they prepared for the ascent, the lunar module began maneuvering as its automatic setting caused it to search for the command module. Stafford regained control of the spacecraft and flew the ascent towards the meeting with the command module. Young flew alone in the command module and prepared to maneuver to the lunar module in the event that its ascent engine did not work. Once the lunar module rendezvoused with the command module, Young successfully docked the two spacecraft. The crew transferred to the command module and undocked from the lunar module, which was flown by Mission Control into a solar orbit. While still in lunar orbit, Young tracked landmarks in preparation for a lunar landing, then flew the trans-Earth injection (TEI) maneuver. On May 26, Apollo 10 reentered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and safely landed from Samoa. It landed from its recovery ship, the , and the crew was recovered by helicopter.

==== Apollo 16 ====


Young was assigned as backup commander of Apollo 13, along with Charles Duke and Jack Swigert. Duke exposed both the primary and backup crews to the German measles, causing the replacement of Ken Mattingly, who was not immune to German measles, by Swigert as the command module pilot two days prior to the launch.

On March 3, 1971, Young was assigned as the commander of Apollo 16, along with Duke and Mattingly. Their backup crew was Fred Haise, Stuart Roosa, and Edgar D. Mitchell. The mission&#x27;s science objective was to study material from the lunar highlands, as they were believed to contain volcanic material older than the lunar mare that had been the sites of the previous Apollo landings. The Apollo Site Selection Board considered landing sites at Alphonsus crater and the Descartes Highlands, and it chose the Descartes Highlands as the Apollo 16 landing site on June 3. The mission science kit contained instruments to sample and photograph the lunar surface, as well as a magnetometer and a seismometer. Additionally, the crew brought an ultraviolet camera and spectrograph to study interplanetary and intergalactic hydrogen. To prepare for their EVAs, Young and Duke participated in field exercises in geological research. They conducted field work at the Mono craters in California to learn how to identify lava domes and tuff and the Sudbury Basin to study breccia.

Apollo 16 successfully launched at 12:54 p.m. on April 16, 1972. After the spacecraft reached Earth orbit, several problems developed with the S-IVB attitude control system, but Apollo 16 was still able to perform its trans-lunar injection burn. Mattingly docked the command module with the lunar module, and the crew decided to perform an early checkout of the lunar module over concerns that it had been damaged but found no issues. Apollo 16 flew behind the Moon 74 hours into the mission and entered into a elliptical orbit. The next day, Duke and Young entered the lunar module and undocked, but Mattingly soon reported an issue with the thrust vector controls on the service propulsion system, which would have prevented the command module from maneuvering in case the lunar module was unable to complete its rendezvous. After a delay, Mission Control approved the landing, and Young and Duke began their descent 5 hours and 42 minutes later than scheduled. As the lunar module descended, its projected landing location was north and west of its target location. Young took corrective action to adjust their landing location, and the lunar module landed north and west of its target location.

On April 21 Young and Duke began their first EVA. Young was the first to exit the lunar module, and his first words on the lunar surface were &quot;I&#x27;m glad they got ol&#x27; Brer Rabbit here, back in the briar patch where he belongs&quot;. The two astronauts set up the lunar rover, and deployed the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP). Mission Control informed Young that the U.S. House of Representatives had passed that year&#x27;s space budget, which included funding to begin the Space Shuttle program. Young tripped over the cables to the heat flow sensors, which irreparably broke the sensors&#x27; communication link with Earth. The two astronauts conducted a seismic experiment using pneumatic hammers and began a traverse to Flag crater, which was west of the landing site. They set up a geology station at the crater, and collected Big Muley, a breccia that was the largest lunar rock collected during the Apollo program. Young and Duke traveled back towards the lunar module, stopping at Spook and Buster craters along the way. Before ending the EVA, they tested the maneuverability of the lunar rover. They finished the EVA after seven hours on the lunar surface.

Young and Duke conducted their second EVA on April 22. They traveled to Cinco crater to sample at three geology sites, with the goal of finding ejecta from the South Ray crater. After they traveled to collect samples at the nearby Wreck crater, the rover&#x27;s navigation system failed, forcing the two astronauts to manually navigate back to the lunar module. On their return trip, they stopped at the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package to take soil samples. They returned to the lunar module and finished their EVA after seven hours on the lunar surface. The third EVA began on the morning of April 23. The two astronauts drove to North Ray crater and collected rock samples from its rim. They collected further samples from outside the crater to allow scientists to recreate the crater&#x27;s stratigraphy using its ejecta. They returned to the lunar module and parked the rover to allow its cameras to broadcast their ascent. They ended their EVA after five hours; it was shorter than the previous two because of the delayed landing on the lunar surface.

On April 24, the lunar module successfully ascended into lunar orbit and docked with the command module. The astronauts transferred the of lunar samples that they collected and jettisoned the lunar module. The command module completed its trans-Earth injection burn and began its flight back to Earth, during which time Mattingly performed an EVA to recover film from the exterior cameras and conduct an experiment on microbe exposure to ultraviolet sunlight. The command module (CM) reentered the atmosphere on April 27 and landed in the ocean approximately southeast of Christmas Island, and the crew was recovered aboard the . After the mission, Young was assigned as the Apollo 17 backup commander, along with Duke as the backup lunar module pilot and Stuart A. Roosa as the backup command module pilot. The backup crew was originally the Apollo 15 crew, but were removed after NASA management learned of their plan to sell the unauthorized postal covers they took to the lunar surface.

=== Space Shuttle program ===
In January 1973, Young was made Chief of the Space Shuttle Branch of the Astronaut Office. At the time, the overall Space Shuttle specifications and manufacturers had been determined, and Young&#x27;s role was to serve as a liaison for the astronauts to provide design input. Young&#x27;s office recommended changes for the orbiter&#x27;s RCS thrusters, star tracker, and thermal radiators. In January 1974, he became Chief of the Astronaut Office after the departure of Alan B. Shepard Jr. One of his first roles after taking over the office was overseeing the end of the Skylab program and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) mission, but the remainder of the spaceflights during his tenure were Space Shuttle missions. Young flew in the T-38 Talon chase planes for several of the Approach and Landing Tests (ALT) of the .

==== STS-1 ====

In March 1978, Young was selected by George W. S. Abbey, then deputy director of the Johnson Space Center (JSC), to be the commander of STS-1, with Robert L. Crippen flying as the pilot. Their backup crew, Joe H. Engle and Richard H. Truly, was the primary crew for STS-2. The development of &quot;Columbia&quot; was delayed because of the longer-than-predicted installation time of the Space Shuttle thermal protection system. Young and Crippen trained to be able to repair thermal tiles in-orbit, but determined that they would be unable to repair the tiles during a spacewalk.

The first launch attempt for STS-1 to launch was on April 10, 1981, but the launch was postponed at T–18 minutes due to a computer error. STS-1 launched at 7:00 a.m. on April 12 from LC-39A at the Kennedy Space Center. The first stage of the launch flew higher than anticipated, and the solid rocket boosters separated approximately higher than the original plan. The rest of the launch went as expected, and STS-1 successfully entered Earth orbit. Vice President George H. W. Bush called the crew during their first full day in orbit to congratulate them on their successful mission. The crew inspected their thermal tiles and determined that some had been lost during launch. Amid concerns that the underside of &quot;Columbia&quot; might have also lost some thermal shielding, a KH-11 KENNEN satellite was used to image the orbiter and it was determined that the orbiter could safely reenter the atmosphere. Young and Crippen tested the orbital maneuvering capabilities of the orbiter, as well as its mechanical and computer systems. STS-1 reentered the atmosphere and landed on April 14 at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

==== STS-9 ====

As the chief of the Astronaut Office, Young recommended the crews that flew on the subsequent test and operational Space Shuttle missions. Young would routinely sit in the simulators alongside the crews to determine their effectiveness, and he flew the Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA) to test landing approaches prior to the orbiter landing.

In 1983, Young flew as the commander of STS-9 aboard . His pilot was Brewster H. Shaw, his two mission specialists were Owen K. Garriott and Robert A. Parker, and his two payload specialists were Byron K. Lichtenberg and West German astronaut Ulf Merbold. The mission was initially scheduled to launch on October 29, but was delayed by a problem with the right solid rocket booster. The flight launched from LC-39A at 11:00 a.m. on November 28. It carried the first Spacelab module into orbit, and the crew had to conduct a shift-based schedule to maximize on-orbit research in astronomy, atmospheric and space physics, and life sciences. Young tested a new portable onboard computer, and attempted to photograph Russian airfields as &quot;Columbia&quot; orbited overhead. Prior to reentry, two of &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s four primary General Purpose Computers (GPC) failed, which caused a delay in landing as they had to reset them and load the Entry Options Control Mode into an alternate GPC. After the GPC was repaired, &quot;Columbia&quot; successfully reentered the atmosphere and landed at Edwards Air Force Base on December 8.

=== NASA management ===
Young remained as the chief of the Astronaut Office after STS-9. He was critical of NASA management following the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster and blamed the disaster on the lack of safety culture within the Space Shuttle program. Young testified before the Rogers Commission, and suggested improvements for the safety program at NASA. Young had been scheduled to fly as the commander of STS-61-J to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope, but the mission was canceled as a result of the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

In May 1987, Young was replaced as the chief of the Astronaut Office by Daniel C. Brandenstein and was reassigned as Special Assistant to Johnson Space Center Director Aaron Cohen for Engineering, Operations and Safety. Young believed that his reassignment was the result of his public criticism of NASA management. He oversaw the redesign of the solid rocket boosters to prevent a repeat of the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster and advocated for the strengthening of the thermal protection tiles at the chin-section of the orbiters. He continued to work on safety improvements in the Space Shuttle program, including improving the landing surfaces, installation of emergency drag parachutes, the inclusion of the Global Positioning System (GPS) into the Space Shuttle&#x27;s navigation system, and improving landing simulations. In February 1996, he was assigned as the Associate Director (Technical) of Johnson Space Center, where he was involved in the development of the Shuttle–Mir program and the design process for the International Space Station (ISS).

After working at NASA for over 42 years Young retired on December 31, 2004. During his career, he flew for more than 15,275 hours, including more than 9,200 hours in T-38s and 835 hours in spacecraft during six space flights. Additionally, he spent over 15,000 hours in training to prepare for eleven primary and backup crew positions.

=== Retirement ===
Following his retirement, Young worked as a public speaker, and advocated for the importance of asteroid impact avoidance, colonization of the Moon, and climate engineering. In April 2006, Young and Crippen appeared at the 25th anniversary of the STS-1 launch at the Kennedy Space Center and spoke of their experiences during the flight. In November 2011, Young and Crippen met with the crew of STS-135, the last Space Shuttle mission.

In 2012, Young and James R. Hansen co-authored his autobiography, &quot;Forever Young&quot;.

== Personal life ==
On December 1, 1955, Young married Barbara White of Savannah, Georgia, at St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Palatka, Florida. Together they had two children, Sandra and John, and two grandchildren. They were divorced in the summer of 1971. Later that year, he married Susy Feldman, and they lived in Houston. Young was friends with George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush, and he vacationed at the Bush compound in Kennebunkport, Maine.

Young died on January 5, 2018, at his home in Houston, of complications from pneumonia, at the age of 87. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery on April 30, 2019. He was remembered by NASA as the man who &quot;walked on the Moon during Apollo 16 and commanded the first space shuttle mission.&quot;

== Awards and honors ==
While he served in the Navy, Young was awarded the Navy Astronaut Wings, Navy Distinguished Service Medal with a 5/16 inch star, and the Distinguished Flying Cross with two stars. During both his military and civilian career with NASA, he received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal (1969) with three oak leaf clusters, the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, the NASA Space Flight Medal, the NASA Exceptional Engineering Achievement Medal, the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal, and the NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal.

In 1981, NASA and the developers of the Space Shuttle won the Collier Trophy, and the crews of STS-1 and STS-2 received special recognition. Young was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1982, along with nine other Gemini astronauts. In 1988 Young was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame. Young, along with the other Gemini astronauts, was inducted into the second U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame class in 1993. In 1995, he was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum. In 2001, Young was inducted into the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame.

Young was awarded the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1993. In 2010, he was awarded the General James E. Hill Lifetime Space Achievement Award He received the Exceptional Engineering Achievement Award in 1985, and the American Astronautical Society Space Flight Award in 1993. In 1998, he received the Philip J. Klass Award for Lifetime Achievement. He was a fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), the American Astronautical Society (AAS), and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP).

Florida State Road 423, a highway in Orlando and Kissimmee, Florida, is named John Young Parkway. John Young Elementary School, a school in the Orange County Public Schools, was named after him. The planetarium at the Orlando Science Center was named in his honor.

Northrop Grumman announced in 2018 that the Cygnus spacecraft for Cygnus NG-10, their tenth cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station, would be named &quot;S.S. John Young&quot;. Cygnus NG-10 successfully launched on November 17, 2018, and concluded its mission on February 25, 2019.

Asteroid 5362 Johnyoung was named after Young.

<doc id="303569" wikidata="Q4975141" url="?curid=303569" title="Brooks–Baxter War">
<text>The Brooks–Baxter War, also known as the Brooks–Baxter Affair, Arkansas Civil War, or the Second American Civil War was an attempt made by failed gubernatorial candidate Joseph Brooks of the “Brindle-tail” faction of Arkansas&#x27; Republican Party to take control of the state from Elisha Baxter, who was the Republican governor. The victor in the end was the Baxter administration, also known as the &quot;Minstrels&quot;, supported by some &quot;carpetbaggers&quot; and Democrats over the Brindle-tails supported by &quot;scalawags&quot; and &quot;freedmen&quot;.

The struggle began with the ratification of the 1868 Arkansas Constitution, rewritten to allow Arkansas to rejoin the Union after the American Civil War. The Reconstruction Acts required the rebel states to accept the 14th Amendment – establishing civil rights for freedmen – and enact new constitutions providing suffrage to freedmen while temporarily disenfranchising former Confederates. Some conservatives and Democrats refused to participate in the writing of the constitution and ceased participation in government. Republicans and Unionists wanting Arkansas to rejoin the Union formed a coalition to write and pass the new constitution, and formed a new state government. In the wake of a wave of reactionary violence by the Ku Klux Klan and a poor economy, the coalition soon fractured into two factions: the Minstrels, who were mostly carpetbaggers, and the Brindle-tails, who were mostly scalawags. This led to a failed impeachment trial of the carpetbagger Republican governor, Powell Clayton; he was then elected a U.S. Senator by the Arkansas General Assembly.

The 1872 gubernatorial election witnessed a narrow victory for Minstrel Elisha Baxter over Brindle-tail Joseph Brooks in an election tainted by fraud and intimidation. Brooks contested the outcome through legal channels, initially without success. However, Baxter&#x27;s decision to restore voting rights to former Confederates alienated much of his support base. In 1874, a county judge declared Brooks the rightful governor, citing election fraud. Brooks seized control of the government by force, but Baxter refused to step down. Each side garnered support from their respective militia, consisting of several hundred black men. This led to several violent clashes between the factions. As the conflict continued, Black Arkansans increasingly supported Brooks over Baxter, and white Democrats rallied behind Baxter in an attempt to end Reconstruction in Arkansas. Ultimately, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant reluctantly intervened, throwing his support behind Baxter and bringing an end to the conflict.

The conflict, followed by a complete restructuring of state government under the Arkansas Constitution of 1874, marked the end of Reconstruction in Arkansas, resulting in a significantly weakened Republican Party in the state as Democrats took power and controlled the governorship for 90 years.

==Background==
===Arkansas Constitution of 1868===
After the American Civil War, rebel states, including Arkansas, were in disarray. Slavery, key to their economies and social structure, was gone. Northerners, whom Southerners called &#x27;carpetbaggers&#x27;, came to the defeated Southern states to work in the rebuilding process. In 1866, Congress grew increasingly disturbed by post-war developments in the rebel states: pre-Civil War elites, including plantation owners and Confederate Army officers, were reelected to government positions, and southern legislatures enacted &quot;Black Codes&quot; limiting the rights of former slaves, and violence against blacks was common. To redress the matter, Congress passed the Reconstruction Acts of 1867, dissolving rebel state governments and dividing the South into military districts. Rebel states could only be readmitted to the Union if they wrote and ratified new constitutions providing civil rights for freedmen, and accepting the 14th Amendment.

In the fall of 1867 Arkansans voted to convene a new constitutional convention and selected delegates, who convened in Little Rock in January 1868. The President was Thomas M. Bowen of Crawford County. The vice presidents included James Hinds, Joseph Brooks, John McClure. A coalition of native white unionists, freedman, and carpetbagger Republicans prevailed on most critical proposals. The 1868 Constitution of Arkansas, adopted by the convention on February 11, 1868, marked a significant shift in the state&#x27;s governance and societal structure. This constitution extended voting rights to emancipated adult male slaves, now referred to as freedmen, acknowledging their new status as citizens. The constitution also introduced a system of public education, accessible to all citizens regardless of race or color. Additionally, welfare institutions were established to support those in need, a provision that had been absent under the previous government. The 1868 Constitution expanded the powers of the governor, including the ability to appoint state officials. Furthermore, the constitution temporarily disenfranchised former Confederate Army officers and those who refused to pledge allegiance to the civil and political equality of all men. This measure was taken to ensure the loyalty of the state&#x27;s citizens and officials to the new order.

The Democratic Party was also in disarray in Arkansas in 1867–68. One unifying principle of the Democrats, however, was white supremacy and resistance to black suffrage. At the January 27, 1868, Democratic State Convention in Little Rock, Democrats announced the avowed purpose of uniting &quot;the opponents of negro suffrage and domination&quot;. Some party leaders opposed Reconstruction in favor of continued military rule, which was far from what they wanted, but seemed like a better option than allowing freedmen all the civil rights of white citizens, including the right to vote. The more conservative wings of the party simply showed no interest in the new constitution and remained loyal to the ideas embodied in the Confederacy. During the constitutional convention, Democrats convened their own party convention. Many chose to boycott elections on the grounds that the new constitution was illegal, because it disenfranchised them while giving suffrage to the freedmen, whom they insisted were an inferior race. They also alienated the freedmen who were now the largest block of voters in the state, by adopting resolutions against them: their first resolution of the convention was &quot;Resolved, that we are in favor of a White Man&#x27;s Government in a White Man&#x27;s country.&quot;

The new constitution was ratified by the people of the state, at the election beginning March 13, 1868. This election was riddled with inconsistency. Alvan Cullem Gillem, the commanding officer of the Fourth Military District which included Arkansas, noted in his report to Congress that more votes had been cast than there were registered voters. Furthermore, the county registrars were allowing people who claimed to be registered in other counties to vote, while also not keeping track of what county these people claimed to be registered in. Despite the obvious inconsistencies in the election, Congress was satisfied and Arkansas was readmitted to the union. This election would be a harbinger of the future voting irregularities that would eventually lead to the Brooks-Baxter conflict.

===Clayton administration===

Powell Clayton, a 35-year-old former brigadier general in the Union army who remained in Arkansas after marrying an Arkansas woman, was elected governor as a Republican in April, 1868. The election was scarred with irregularities. For example, the return of votes in Pulaski County exceeded the number of registered voters. Also, the registrars, who controlled the distribution of ballots, admitted that they had given ballots to voters from other counties if they could show a valid registration certificate. Both sides claimed election fraud and voter intimidation: armed parties had been stationed on roads to keep voters away from the polls. General Gillem, commander of the military district that included Arkansas, wrote to General Grant that it would take months to sort out which side had committed the greater election fraud.

In July 1868, Arkansas rejoined the Union and Clayton was inaugurated governor. The new general assembly had already begun meeting in April, but had been unable to do anything other than prepare legislation for the time when the state was readmitted. The prior governor, Isaac Murphy, whose administration was not recognized by the federal government, continued to act as executive of the state during this time. Both Clayton and Murphy managed to draw a paycheck as governor at the same time. When Clayton took office, he appointed most of the key Republican politicians to positions within the new state government; however, he failed to find a place for Joseph Brooks.

Rivalry between Brooks and Clayton predated the 1868 election. Clayton saw Brooks as his strongest competitor for preference and distinction and did not want him to become too entrenched with the party leadership. Brooks felt that his ability and service to the party were not being recognized or appreciated, and he grew bitter and resentful of the other Republicans, including Clayton.

Democrats, calling themselves &quot;Conservatives,&quot; strongly opposed granting freedmen voting rights, viewing it as an overreach of the 14th Amendment. Their resistance stemmed from a perceived threat to political power and social order. Frustration grew as they had to pay taxes for infrastructure while still being disenfranchised, fueling opposition to Radical policies.

Violence soon erupted throughout the state. Former Confederate Army officers in nearby Memphis, Tennessee, formed the Ku Klux Klan to fight against the new order. The Klan quickly spread into Arkansas. Republican officials, including Congressmen James Hinds, were attacked, as were black citizens seeking to exercise their new civil rights. Hinds and Brooks were ambushed by gunmen on the road in Monroe County, while traveling to a political event. Brooks was severely wounded and Hinds was killed. Hinds was the first sitting member of congress to ever be murdered, and his murder created national disgust for the ongoing political violence in the South. A coroner&#x27;s inquest identified a local Democratic official and suspected Ku Klux Klansman as the killer. Most contemporaries blamed the Klan, which had threatened to kill Hinds and was actively killing and assaulting other Republicans. Reflecting the times, no-one was ever arrested for the murder. As more violence spread throughout the state, Clayton declared martial law in 14 counties.

Many Democratic newspapers denied the existence of the secretive Ku Klux Klan while still reporting on the violence. 20th-century research shows the Klan was responsible for most of the violence in the state at this time. A state militia was organized to put down the violence, although it was poorly equipped. With no uniforms and irregular weapons and mounts, the militia was often mistaken for wandering bands of plunderers, sparking a brief but long-remembered &quot;Militia War&quot;, and causing terror throughout the state. This was similar to what was going on in North Carolina at the same time, now referred to as the Kirk–Holden war.

Fearing he could not guarantee the integrity of the polling places, Clayton canceled fall elections in counties where political violence had broken out. In doing so, however, he further reduced the Democratic vote, and the state ended up supporting the election of President Grant, the Republican candidate, despite the population being mostly Democratic.

===Paying for the new infrastructure===
Governor Clayton faced a desperate need for infrastructure rebuilding. His diverse efforts included hefty tax hikes, bond issues to restore credit, and even printing state-issued &quot;scrip.&quot; Despite these measures, soaring inflation, economic hardship, and a tripling of Arkansas&#x27;s debt by 1873 marked this period of financial struggle and political discontent.
Introducing more taxes proved to be hugely unpopular among both Democrats and Republicans, and the people of the state were not generally prosperous. Bond issues generated controversy and were the source of scandals in the administration. All of the old railroad and infrastructure bonds, including the controversial Holford bonds which had already been declared illegal by the Arkansas Supreme Court, were gathered into a funding act and passed by the legislature. Many bonds were issued for roads and railroads that were never built, or were constructed and then torn up and rebuilt in another direction. Some projects even received the same amount of funding from different bonds, such as embankments built for railroads where roads were funded to be built by a different bond. One of the most controversial bonds involved the purchase of slate for a state penitentiary roof, which was diverted for the construction of a mansion of a Republican official J. L. Hodges, who eventually served jail time for the incident. Promissory notes, or scrip, were issued to raise money. The money was used for construction projects, and invested in public infrastructure. Article VI, Sec 10 of the new constitution stated that the credit of the state could not be loaned without the consent of the voters, making these promissory notes illegal. Their introduction also caused actual currency to go out of circulation.

The Radical Republican state initiatives included levees and railroads. Arkansas&#x27; first public school system was created. The administration and its supporters established Arkansas Industrial University, the basis for the future University of Arkansas in Fayetteville; what would become the Arkansas School for the Deaf; and the Arkansas School for the Blind, which relocated from Arkadelphia to Little Rock. However, state debt increased dramatically. The state had a budget surplus when Clayton came to office, but by the end of his term, the state debt had increased to $5 million.

===Minstrels and Brindle-tails===
The &#x27;scalawag&#x27; native conservative Republicans and the &#x27;carpetbagger&#x27; migrant radical Republicans had managed to form a coalition to seize complete control of the state in 1868, however this would be short lived. Clayton actively pursued social and political reforms during Reconstruction, including enfranchising freedmen and advocating for their civil rights. This alienated many white Republicans, who saw these policies as a threat to their traditional power structure and social dominance. Many white Republicans, particularly in rural areas, held racist views and resented the advancements made by freedmen. They opposed Clayton&#x27;s Reconstruction policies and felt the party was straying from its original focus on economic revival and states&#x27; rights. Personal rivalries and disagreements over political strategies further fueled the division. Some Republicans prioritized economic recovery and believed cooperation with Democrats (who held economic power) was necessary. Others, saw Democrats as obstructionist and favored more radical measures to address economic disparities and empower freedmen. National Republican policies, particularly President Grant&#x27;s perceived leniency towards the South, further fueled discontent among Arkansas Republicans. Some felt the national party was abandoning its commitment to Reconstruction and racial equality. The Democratic party actively exploited the divisions within the Republican party, portraying the Scalawags as traitors to white southerners and the Carpetbaggers as dangerous radicals. These factors converged to create a deep rift within the Republican party, and irreconcilably divided the party into factions.

The scalawags met in convention and adopted the name the &quot;Liberal Republicans&quot; and a populist platform for universal amnesty, universal suffrage, economic reforms, and an end to the so-called Clayton dictatorship. A small group of Claytonites, disgruntled with the extravagance of the administration, also defected to this group. Among them was Joseph Brooks, who claimed to be the originator of Radicalism in Arkansas and became their natural leader. Brooks was a Northern Methodist preacher and had been a chaplain in a black regiment for the Union army. He was known for his fiery speeches that united political and religious themes. He had been the chairman of the 1868 Republican state convention and was at the time the State Senator from White County and Pulaski County. Although he had been involved with the carpetbaggers since the beginning, Clayton had not given him a government position, seeing Brooks as a potential rival.

The Claytonites started calling the new faction the Brindle-tails. This name can be traced back to Clayton supporter Jack Agery, who was a freedman, contractor, and orator in the state. In a speech he gave in Eagle Township in Pulaski County, he said that Brooks reminded him of a &quot;brindle-tailed bull&quot; he had known as a child that scared all the other cattle. Brooks claimed that they were originally just called &quot;Brindles&quot; referring to the mixed races of his supporters, his initial power base had been the black community. The Claytonist, he said, added the &quot;tail&quot; part in their newspapers. The Brindle-tails&#x27; platform included a proposal for a new constitution that would re-enfranchise ex-Confederates, which appealed to Democrats and pre-war Whigs. They began gaining support among the disenfranchised and the Liberal Republicans.

For their part, the Brindle-tails mockingly referred to the carpetbaggers and Claytonist Republicans as the Minstrels, and that name stuck as well. This moniker can probably be traced to John G. Price, the editor of the &quot;Little Rock Republican&quot; and a staunch Clayton supporter. Price was known to be a good musician and comedian and had even once filled in for a sick performer in a minstrel show, complete with blackface.

The Brindle-tails desperately wanted Clayton out of the governor&#x27;s office. Conveniently, Lieutenant Governor James M. Johnson was a Brindle-tail, so the natural course of action was to try to get rid of Clayton and let Johnson succeed him. Clayton was well aware of their plans, and when he left the state briefly for New York on business concerning the Holford Bonds, he informed no one. When Johnson, who was at home some distance from the capital, found out he tried to head to the capital to take control and have Clayton arrested and impeached. He arrived too late. Subsequently, after Johnson made a speech demanding changes in the administration, the Minstrels started to target Johnson. On January 30, 1871, they introduced articles of impeachment in the General Assembly against him. The chief charge was that Johnson, acting as the President of the Senate, had administered the oath of office to Joseph Brooks, who had recently been elected as state senator, and then recognized him on the floor. Although this was legitimately within his powers as the lieutenant governor to do, he escaped impeachment by only two votes. The scrutiny of the proceedings seriously damaged his reputation, even though he had done nothing wrong, and his political career never recovered.

In 1871, Clayton was accused of deliberately tampering with the results of the U.S. house election between Thomas Boles and John Edwards in the third congressional district. According to Arkansas law, the results were to be certified and given to the secretary of state, then Robert J. T. White. After that, the governor and secretary of state would &quot;take up and arrange&quot; the results and the governor would issue a proclamation declaring the winner and deliver the seal of the state to him. Boles won the election but Clayton instead certified Edwards as the winner following the actions of the State Supreme Court and a legislature investigation concerning the outcome of the General Assembly elections in Pulaski County. Polls in Pulaski County were taken over by Brindle-tails and stopped legally appointed Minstrel judges from arriving at the polls to do their duty. Judges for the polls of the First and Third Wards and Eagle Township held separate voting boxes nearby. The clerk certified all usurped boxes and refused to certify the votes that were conducted by the legally appointed judges. The defeated candidates sued, and the State Supreme Court forced the clerk to certify the votes. As a result, the Brindle-tail delegates of Pulaski County were expelled from the state house. A legislature committee headed by S. W. Mallory recommended that the elections of certain townships in Pulaski County be declared void. The senate followed and expelled Joseph Brooks and seated his opponent. Clayton, convinced of fraud, declared Edwards as the winner of the election despite the Secretary of State already certifying Boles’ victory of 10,314 Boles to 8,210 Edwards. Clayton was then indicted by the federal circuit court of violating the first enforcement act. It was found that his actions were not illegal, he was in no way binding to the Congress and under federal law of the time, state governors were not considered election officials. Boles became a congressman.

To sequester Clayton from the affairs in the state, the Brindle-tails and the Democrats decided the only thing they could do was elect him to the U.S. Senate. However, even though he won unanimously, he refused to take his seat, which would mean letting Johnson become governor. In 1871, the state House of Representatives drafted articles of impeachment against Clayton, charging him with a wide variety of impeachable actions, including depriving Johnson and several other state officials of offices to which they had been fairly elected, removing state officials and judges from offices to which they had been fairly elected, aiding in fraudulent elections, taking bribes for state railroad bonds, and various other high crimes and misdemeanors. The members of the House then tried to suspend Clayton from his duties as governor by force. They even apparently tried locking him in his office and nailing the door shut. However, Clayton responded that they had no right by the state constitution to deprive him of his office. At the same time, the House also brought impeachment charges against Chief Justice John McClure for his part in trying to deny Johnson the privileges of his office of lieutenant governor.

Two successive inquiries failed to find evidence against Clayton. The legislature refused to continue, all charges were dropped, and Clayton was exonerated. In fact, he was never found guilty of any wrongdoing while governor. Finally a deal was reached. Johnson, now politically badly damaged by his impeachment ordeal and willing to take any position he could get, resigned as lieutenant governor, was appointed Secretary of State, and was given a compensation of several thousand dollars for his loss of power and prestige, since he would not become governor. A staunch Clayton supporter, O. A. Hadley, was then appointed lieutenant governor. Three days later, Clayton left the state for Washington, D.C., to join the U.S. Senate, and Hadley succeeded him as governor.

The Democrats&#x27; paper, the &quot;Arkansas Daily Gazette&quot; crowed:

It will be a source of infinite joy and satisfaction, to the oppressed and long suffering people of Arkansas, to learn that, on yesterday, the tyrant, despot and usurper, late of Kansas, but more recently, governor of Arkansas, took his departure from the city and his hateful presence out of our state, it is to be hoped, forever and ever.

Although no longer a state official, Clayton remained the leader of the state Republicans and was controlling now not only appointments within the state, but also the flow of federal money and positions. He began purging Brindle-tails from federal office, including Joseph Brooks, who was at this point an Internal Revenue Assessor.

==1872 gubernatorial election==

===Party Nominations===

The Brindle Tails, the break off mostly non nativist Liberal Republicans, chose Joseph Brooks as their nominee for Governor. Brooks was a very vocal supporter of civil rights for former slaves, but also a supporter of re-enfranchisement for ex-Confederates, which was the sentiment nationally of Liberal Republicans.

At their party convention, the Minstrels faction nominated Elisha Baxter as their candidate. Baxter was a lawyer, politician, and merchant from North Carolina who had settled in Batesville. A lifelong Whig, he was elected Mayor of Batesville in 1853 and elected to the state legislature in 1858. At the start of the American Civil War, Baxter refused to fight for the Confederacy and attempted to flee to Missouri. He was captured and tried for treason. He escaped north and joined the 4th Arkansas Mounted Infantry (Union), serving as colonel of the regiment. In 1864, after Arkansas was occupied by Union troops, Baxter was appointed as Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court, but he did not serve in that position. He and William Meade Fishback were chosen by the new legislature in May 1864 as the two U.S. senators from Arkansas, but in February 1865, their admission was denied by congressional Republicans displeased with Lincoln for trying to restore Southern representation in Congress so easily. In mid-1865, Baxter formed a law partnership in Little Rock with future U.S. Congressman and fellow Unionist James M. Hinds.

The Mistrals, who were also the regular Republican party, chose Baxter believing since he was seen as a long time resident of the state, and was a former slave holder he would appeal to the nativests Republicans and Democrats alike. Brooks was thoroughly disliked by both nativists Republicans and Democrats, in fact Clayton would muse in his memoirs that besides himself Joseph Brooks was the most disliked person in the state of Arkansas. Nevertheless, When the Democrats met, they agreed not only to not run a candidate, but to support Joseph Brooks. It was reported at the time that the committee had sent a group of Democrats to meet with Brooks and he had pledged to them that if elected he would support free and fair elections and re-enfranchisement of Confederates. However, Powell Clayton would later accuse Brooks of a broader political deal with the friends of Ku Klux Klan members Dandridge McRae and Jacob Frolich, who were involved in the murder of Albert H. Parker and had become fugitives. The agreement entailed that the Democrats would not nominate a state ticket for the 1872 election and would instead support Brooks and his followers for state offices. In exchange for Democratic support, Brooks and his faction were to assist in acquitting the White County prisoners, who were associated with McRae and Frolich. This alliance was also aimed at supporting a Horace Greeley Liberal National ticket. The deal included plans for the acquittal of McRae, Frolich, and other prisoners, involving manipulation of the judicial process, such as the election of a special judge sympathetic to their cause and the scattering of witnesses to prevent their testimony. Neither McRae or Frolich would ever be indicted and would end up serving as Secretary of State and Deputy Secretary of state of Arkansas respectively.

===General election===
The election of 1872 has been described as a &quot;masterpiece of confusion&quot; by Arkansas historian Michael B. Dougan. &quot;That carpetbagger Brooks ran with Democratic support against a scalawag nominated by a party composed almost exclusively of carpetbaggers was enough to bewilder most voters as well as the modern student.&quot;

In the days before the election and the days afterward, predictions and reports of fraud were printed daily in the &quot;Gazette.&quot; Because of the relatively slow communications, messages from other counties were often delayed up to a week. There were numerous reports of anomalies in state polling centers, including names being inexplicably stricken from the voter registration lists and persons voting without proof of registration. The &quot;Gazette&quot; wrote:

It would be as great a farce of yesterday&#x27;s election to designate it otherwise than a fraud. It was one of the worst ever yet perpetrated in the state. The city judges paid no attention to any registration either old or new, but permitted everybody to vote, and in many instances without question. Men were marched from one ward to another and voted early and often.

On November 6, 1872, the day after the general election, the &quot;Gazette&quot; reported: &quot;The election was one of the most quiet in Little Rock we ever witnessed.&quot; The returns on that day were too small to report with any certainty who had won, and the newspaper reported fraud. Rumors flew about claiming that registration had been cut short or extended in many counties to suit the needs of whoever controlled the polling places. The following Monday, the &quot;Gazette&quot; published incomplete tallies from the various counties, showing a small majority for Baxter. They also reported more forms of attempted fraud. Some unofficial polling places had apparently been set up, but only those votes cast at the regular polls had been certified.

By November 15, the &quot;Gazette&quot; claimed victory for Brooks. By the next day, because of the irregularities and votes that would be thrown out, the projected winner was Baxter, by only 3,000 votes. The General Assembly met on January 6 for a special joint session to declare Baxter, who by their count had received the most votes, the legal winner of the election. After a short address he was sworn in by Chief Justice John McClure. He then assumed the duties of Governor of the State of Arkansas.

Brooks supporters immediately claimed that the election had been dishonest. The Democrats, the Brindle-tails, and all non-Republican newspapers openly and vocally denounced the election as fraudulent, and insisted that Brooks had in fact received the most votes. The general citizenry of both parties, however, accepted the results. The Brooks supporters were in the minority in believing that the election had been fraudulent.

==Electoral disputes==
===Brooks&#x27;s legal battle===
The first to file suit over the election was Judge William M. Harrison, who had been on the Brooks ticket. He filed a Bill of Equity with the U.S. Circuit Court in Little Rock, claiming he had a right to a seat on the Supreme Court due to the fraudulent election. The Brooks Campaign likewise filed suit in the Circuit Court shortly thereafter on January 7, 1873. Judge H. C. Caldwell heard the Harrison case, and rendered an opinion stating that the Federal Court had no jurisdiction in the matter, and dismissed the case. The Harrison decision resulted in the dismissal of the Brooks case as well.

Brooks then took a petition to the General Assembly, asking for a recount. The assembly took up the matter on April 20, 1873, and voted 63 to 9 not to allow Brooks to contest the election. This did not deter Brooks, and he applied to the Arkansas Supreme Court for a writ of &quot;quo warranto&quot;, and was again denied. They also ruled that state courts had no jurisdiction in the matter, and dismissed the case. They gave a lengthy explanation as to why the General Assembly should decide contested gubernatorial elections in Joint Session, since they are the directly elected representatives of the people.

It appeared that Brooks had exhausted all legal avenues at this point, but on June 16, 1873, he filed another lawsuit against Baxter, this time with the Pulaski County district court. Under Arkansas Civil Code sec. 525, if a person usurps an office or franchise to which he is not entitled, an action at law may be instituted against him either by the State or by the party rightly entitled to the office. On October 8, 1873, Baxter filed a plea of non-jurisdiction, but he believed that the court might decide against him. He issued a telegram to President Grant informing him of the basic situation in Arkansas and asked for federal troops to help him maintain the peace. Grant denied his request.

===Baxter and Brooks switch positions===
There were rumors that Joseph McClure, the Chief Justice who had sworn him into office, intended to have Baxter either arrested or killed, ostensibly because Baxter had replaced W. W. Wilshire, a Minstrel, with Robert C. Newton, an ex-Confederate, as head of the state militia. U.S. Attorney General Williams contacted Baxter and suggested that he ask for federal troops for protection again. A letter from President Grant followed, offering protection. The Grant administration usually followed Powell Clayton&#x27;s lead where Arkansas matters were concerned, so it can be concluded that the former governor was still supporting Baxter. The Republican Party of Arkansas, still controlled by the Minstrel faction, issued a statement denouncing Brooks&#x27; attempt to contest the election, which was published in the &quot;Little Rock Republican&quot; on October 8, 1873, and signed by all the major members of the party, including Clayton. However, the Minstrels would soon turn on Baxter for not following the party line.

Baxter had now been governor for a year and was following an independent course. He began dismantling the systems put in place by the Minstrels. He appointed honest Democrats and Republicans to the Election Commission, reorganized the militia by placing it under the control of the State, rather than the governor, and pushed for an amendment to the state constitution to re-enfranchise ex-Confederates.

On March 3, 1873, the state legislature passed a bill re-enfranchising ex-Confederates, to the delight of much of the state population and the concern of the Minstrels. The legislature called a special election in November to replace 33 members, mostly Minstrels, who had left for patronage jobs in the Baxter government. Baxter refused to let the Minstrels manipulate the election, declaring that free, honest elections would be held during his term. With the help of the newly re-enfranchised voters, conservative Democrats swept the election and gained a small majority in the legislature. Baxter was about to erode his Republican base out from under him.

In March 1874, Baxter vetoed the Railroad Steel Bill, the centerpiece of the Radical Republican Reconstruction plan. The bill would have released the railroad companies from their debts to the state and created a tax to pay the interest on the bonds. This was clearly not legal and the veto called into question the legality of the 1868 railroad bonds, which created a public bonded debt. It is likely the Minstrels struck a deal with Brooks to support the railroad bonds, and within a month the political backers of Brooks and Baxter began to switch.

Most importantly Senator Clayton had lost confidence in Governor Baxter&#x27;s moderate style, which clashed with Clayton&#x27;s progressive agenda. In his memoirs, written much later in life, Clayton would accuse Baxter of colluding with the Democrats, even saying when the two were traveling together campaigning Baxter would sneak off at night to meet secretly with Democrats, and made them promises he had no authority to. He would go as far as to say of Baxter: &quot;If we did not elect Judge Baxter, we were defeated; and if we did elect him, we were also defeated, which in the end proved true.&quot; Specifically, what Clayton was most displeased with was Baxter&#x27;s veto&#x27;s several bills. One to fund the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad which had become embroiled in a scandal that involved House Speaker and Presidential candidate James G. Blaine. Another was a bill that called a constitutional convention to frame a new state constitution; Clayton believed that a new constitution was necessary to secure the rights of the freedmen and the loyal Unionists. Clayton was now publicly accusing Baxter of fraud. Besides the corruption in the 1872 election, Clayton claimed Baxter had issued fraudulent election credentials to several members of the legislature who were not legally elected, although who these members were and what the situation was is not clear. He also alleged that Baxter had used bribery and intimidation to secure his own election as governor. Clayton declared that Baxter was not the lawful governor of Arkansas, but an usurper who had betrayed the Republican party and the loyal people of the state. Clayton issued a statement saying that &quot;Brooks was fairly elected in 1872; and kept out of office by fraud.&quot; Governor Baxter was now being supported by the Brindle-tails, re-enfranchisers, and the Democrats; whereas Brooks was finding support among the Claytonists, Northerners, Unionists, and Minstrels.

Brooks was assigned three prominent Minstrel attorneys, and after a year of sitting on the docket, at about 11 am on April 15, 1874, Baxter&#x27;s demurrer to Brook&#x27;s complaint was suddenly called up. Neither of Baxter&#x27;s lawyers were present in the court room, and the demurrer had been submitted without their knowledge. Without giving Baxter any time to testify, Judge Whytock overruled the demurrer and awarded Brooks $2,000 in damages and the office of Governor of Arkansas. Neither Brooks nor the court notified the legislature or Governor Baxter. Judge Wytock then swore in Joseph Brooks as the new governor of Arkansas, despite having no authority to do so.

== Brindle-tails Seizure of Power ==

With the aid of General Robert F. Catterson and state militia, Brooks, accompanied by about 20 armed men, marched to the Arkansas Capitol building (now known as &quot;the Old Statehouse&quot;), located at Markham and Center streets in downtown Little Rock. They encountered little to no resistance and were able to seize the capital building and the state seal. The capital building did not have armed guards, a point Baxter remarked would have been absurd given the traditions of the American people.

By the end of the afternoon, nearly 300 armed men had converged on the lawn of the State Capitol. Brooks&#x27; men seized the state arsenal and began turning the Statehouse into an armed camp. Telegrams covered in signatures were sent to President Ulysses S. Grant supporting Brooks as the legal governor. Three out of the five Supreme Court justices also telegraphed the President in support of Brooks. Brooks telegraphed the President himself asking for access to weapons housed at the federal arsenal. He also issued a statement to the press proclaiming himself governor. The senators from the state, Clayton and Steven Dorsey, met with President Grant, and they sent a message to Brooks giving their support.

Brooks and his men told Baxter to leave or he would be arrested, given that he was outnumbered he was forced to comply, and before he could summon help the capital was over run with &quot;desperadoes&quot;. He went to the Anthony House, three blocks away from the State Capitol, where he had supporters, and established a headquarters there. Powell Clayton refers to the Anthony House as &quot;Democrat Headquarters&quot; in his memoir. Baxter began immediately sending telegrams to President Grant and other officials asking them to intervene and uphold his legitimacy. He also issued a proclamation denouncing Brooks as an usurper and a traitor, and calling on the people of Arkansas to rally his supporters. Fighting did occur outside the hotel, and at least one man, David Fulton Shall, a prominent real estate dealer, was shot dead while standing in a window of the building.

Baxter then moved his headquarters to St. Johns College, a Masonic institution on the southeastern edge of the state. Baxter issued two proclamations to the press from his temporary office, asserting his rights to the governorship by vote of the people and the decision of the legislature; both were printed in the &quot;Gazette&quot;. He received support from many prominent Democrats in the city, all of whom had initially voted for Brooks. He then issued a dispatch to President Grant explaining the situation, calling Brooks and his band &quot;revolutionaries&quot;, and stating that he would do everything up to and including armed conflict to regain control of the state organs. He asked for the support of the Federal Government.

Brooks issued a proclamation to the people of Arkansas asking them for their support. Baxter answered with a proclamation to the people of Arkansas declaring martial law in Pulaski County. A company was then issued from the young men of Little Rock. On the evening of April 16, the assembled army, now being referred to as the &quot;Hallie Riflers&quot;, escorted Baxter back to the Anthony House, where he set up his headquarters, and from there he began trying to do the state&#x27;s business once more.

On April 18, Hercules King Cannon White of Pine Bluff offered militia support to Baxter. He organized three three companies of 300 African American troops and brought them to Little Rock by Steamboat and they marched to Anthony House with a brass band. He is reported to have said: &quot;Furnish us simply with the means -- give us the authority -- pronounce the order and I will guarantee to you, sir, that in 25 minutes from the time the order is written, Joseph Brooks will either be in hell or the archives.&quot; When this commotion lead to a scuffle in the street that killed an innocent bystander, Baxter asked White to return with his militia to Pine Bluff. However, White became frustrated by inactivity, and on April 30 he commandeered the steamboat &quot;Belle of Texas&quot;, carrying about 150 militiamen to confront Brooks supporters at New Gascony. After a confrontation at Ashley&#x27;s gin, White&#x27;s forces prevailed, capturing around sixty prisoners, including leaders Joseph L. Murphy and Captain Vandesand.

There were now two militias marching and singing through Little Rock as the city became a battleground. Commanding both forces were ex-Confederate soldiers. Former Brigadier-General James F. Fagan commanded the Brooks men, and Robert C. Newton, a former Colonel, commanded the Hallie Riflers, or Baxter&#x27;s forces. Baxter&#x27;s men occupied the downstairs billiards area of the Anthony House and patrolled the cross streets outside. Down the street, the Brooks men patrolled the front of the state house. The front line was Main Street. The postmaster handled the situation by only delivering mail addressed to Brooks or Baxter and holding all mail simply addressed to &quot;Governor of Arkansas&quot;.

The Lady Baxter, a cannon on permanent display in front of the Old State House, is the most prominent artifact remaining from the Brooks-Baxter war. The cannon is a Confederate copy of a United States Model 1848 64-pounder siege gun Naval columbiad, designed to fire explosive shells. Originally from a foundry in New Orleans, it was brought to Arkansas in the summer of 1862 by the steamboat &quot;Ponchatrain&quot; and saw action on the Mississippi, White, and Arkansas rivers until it was transferred to Fort Hindman at Arkansas Post. Union forces captured the fort in 1863 but left the cannon behind. It was then brought to Little Rock by Confederates and placed on Hanger Hill overlooking the river to ward off any ships coming upstream, but in this position at least it was never fired. Little Rock was captured in September 1863. Confederates tried to burst the cannon and then, failing that, drove a nail into the touch hole and abandoned it on the shore. It sat there half embedded in the ground until 1874. The Baxter men pulled the cannon out of the soil, repaired it, rechristened it the &quot;Lady Baxter&quot;, and made it ready to fire. It was placed in the rear of the Odd Fellows hall, now the Metropolitan Hotel, on the corner of Main and Markham streets to hit any boats bringing supplies for Brooks up the river. The cannon, however, was only fired once, a celebratory blast, when Baxter finally returned to the governor&#x27;s seat. The war&#x27;s final casualty was the result of the cannon firing, as the operator was badly injured. It has since been in its current place on brick pedestals in front of the then-state capitol, only briefly threatened by World War II scrap drives.

Overtones of the Civil War and racial conflict were evident. Brooks&#x27; men numbered 600 by this time and were all freedmen who supported Republicans as their emancipators. Baxter&#x27;s forces, all white Democrats, continued to grow steadily during the conflict until they reached nearly 2,000. Several bloody skirmishes occurred. Known as the Battle of Palarm, a small naval battle erupted on the Arkansas River near Natural Steps, where Brooks&#x27; men attacked a flatboat known as the &quot;Hallie&quot;, thought to be bringing supplies. The shooting lasted around ten to fifteen minutes before the pilot ran up a white flag signaling a surrender. One stray bullet pierced the vessel&#x27;s supply pipe between the boiler and engine, cutting off its power, and the boat drifted downriver, out of gun range, and lodged on the Southern (Western) shore. Sources vary as to the actual casualties of the incident. The boat&#x27;s captain, a pilot, and one rifleman were killed; the other pilot and three or four riflemen were wounded. One source stated that the Brooks regiment suffered one man killed and three wounded; another report was that five men were killed and &quot;quite a number&quot; wounded.

Casualty reports vary widely depending on the source; &quot;the New York Times&quot; of May 30, 1874, gave the following for casualties and fatalities:
===Brooks loses favor===
On May 3, men claiming to be acting on behalf of Baxter supporters hijacked a train from Memphis, Tennessee, and arrested federal Court Justices John E. Bennett and Elhanan J. Searle, thinking that the Court would be unable to rule without a quorum of Judges. Baxter denied that they were acting under his direction. The Judges were taken to Benton, Arkansas. For several days, their whereabouts were unknown to the public and federal officials began a search for the Justices. Justice Bennett was able to send a letter to Captain Rose demanding to know why they were being held by the Governor of Arkansas. Upon receipt of the letter, troops were sent to Benton to retrieve the two Justices, but they had escaped by May 6 and made their way to Little Rock.

In Washington, Brooks was supported politically, but Baxter also had support because of the undemocratic way he had been removed from office. President Grant had already dealt with the outcome of the contested election for Governor of Louisiana, the Colfax massacre, where federal troops had to be sent to restore order. As Brooks and Baxter scrambled for support in Washington, D.C., Grant pushed for the dispute to be settled in Arkansas. Baxter demanded the General Assembly be called into session. He knew he had their support, but so did Brooks, so he and his men would not allow anyone to enter the capitol building. Brooks, on the other hand, had the support of the district court. He enlisted Little Rock&#x27;s premiere lawyer, U. M. Rose, head of the still-prominent Rose Law Firm. However, Grant&#x27;s decision would soon set in motion the demise of Brooks. 

It was becoming clear that federal intervention was required to settle the dispute, despite the general policy of the Grant administration to stay out of the affairs of Southern states. The President often expressed annoyance with Southern governors who requested help from federal troops to combat regular waves of election year violence, with little compassion for the issues they faced. Grant and the United States Attorney General, George Henry Williams, issued a joint communique supporting Baxter and ordering Brooks to vacate the capitol. They also referred the dispute back to the State Legislature.

On May 11, Governor Baxter asked the General Assembly to meet in special session, which they did. Apparently, they met &quot;behind Baxter lines&quot; although where that was is not exactly clear. Since the Speaker of the House and President pro tempore of the Senate were both absent, being that they were both Brooks supporters, they were replaced. J. G. Frierson was elected President pro tempore of the Senate and James H. Berry Speaker of the House. They then passed an act calling for a constitutional convention, which Governor Baxter approved on May 18. The act scheduled an election for the last day of June and appointed delegates from the counties of Arkansas. Two days later, Generals Newton and Fagan negotiated an armistice. At the same time, the Arkansas Supreme Court had finally decided to hear the Brooks case, and voted three to one in favor of Baxter&#x27;s election, further solidifying the Grant proclamation and Baxter as governor. The bar of the Pulaski County Circuit court also met and issued a resolution that stated that Judge Wytock had acted independently, and his decision did not represent the court. The trial had been deliberately unfair for the defendant Baxter, and the Supreme Court had already ruled that, under the state constitution, the court had no jurisdiction. They rendered Judge Wytock&#x27;s decision null and void.

On May 19, General Newton and his troops reoccupied the State House grounds, which had just been evacuated by Brooks&#x27; forces, and on the 20th, he reinstated Governor Baxter.

== Poland Committee ==
The Poland Committee was a congressional committee established by the U.S. House of Representatives to investigate the situation in Arkansas in the aftermath of the Brooks–Baxter War. It was chaired by Representative Luke P. Poland of Vermont. The committee consisted of three Republicans (Poland, Henry Scudder of New York, and Jasper D. Ward of Illinois) and two Democrats (Representatives Milton Sayler of Ohio and Joseph Sloss of Alabama)

The committee was charged with investigating matters in Arkansas to ascertain whether there was such a republican form of government there as the United States should recognize. Over the course of its investigation, the committee held two hearings in Washington DC.

On February 6, 1875, a report from the majority, reflecting the position of four out of the five members of the committee, was submitted to the United States Congress. This document acknowledged the election of Brooks in the year 1872 but essentially concluded that the opportunity for any remedial action had passed. This determination stemmed from the committee&#x27;s findings that, despite certain irregularities in the formulation and ratification of the state constitution of 1874, the constitution itself was in alignment with republican principles and had garnered the support of a majority of Arkansas&#x27;s residents. This situation met the primary standards used by the federal government to assess the legitimacy of state governments, leading to the conclusion that there was no need for federal intervention. The report pointed out that Augustus Garland, who was elected under the 1874 constitution, legitimately occupied the governor&#x27;s office, rendering any previous claims to the position by Brooks moot. Moreover, the committee acknowledged the lukewarm attitude towards full citizenship rights for African Americans within the state and region but opined that it was improbable that their rights would be actively contested by the white population, thus eliminating the necessity for federal action.

Despite initial support for the Baxter administration, President Ulysses S. Grant sided with a minority report by Congressman Ward of Illinois, who, following a visit to Arkansas facilitated by Senator Stephen Dorsey, a Brooks advocate, suggested that Brooks should be reinstated as governor by federal intervention. Ward&#x27;s report, influenced by meetings predominantly with Brooks&#x27;s supporters, contradicted the majority&#x27;s conclusion, advocating that the 1868 Arkansas Constitution remained in effect, thereby legitimating Brooks&#x27;s claim to the governorship.

Shortly after the committee&#x27;s findings were presented to the House, President Grant issued a special message endorsing Brooks as the rightful governor, critiquing the state constitution&#x27;s reach during a period of constitutional redefinition. Despite Grant&#x27;s support for Brooks, the House soon passed a resolution backing the committee&#x27;s majority report, effectively opposing Grant&#x27;s stance. Faced with limited options and with Augustus Garland already serving as governor since his 1874 election, President Grant ceased further intervention.

==Aftermath==
In June 1874, Clayton announced that he could no longer control matters in Arkansas and that he and his friends would be willing to enter into any arrangement whereby they could at least be safe from persecution and prosecution. However, the Democrats retaliated by impeaching many Minstrels, including Supreme Court Justice John McClure. Clayton finished his Senate term but was not re-elected.

On September 7, 1874, the new constitution was completed and signed by a majority of delegates. The entire electorate, including the disenfranchised Confederates and the freedmen, voted. The election not only was for ratification of the new constitution but also for state officials that would be elected if the constitution was indeed ratified. The Republicans actually took the same position that the Democrats had taken earlier, believing that the election was illegal they nominated no candidates. Conservative Democrats and allied paramilitary groups suppressed black voting, using a combination of intimidation, blocking blacks from the polls, and outright assassinations. The new constitution was ratified on October 13, 1874, and Democratic officials elected almost unanimously, including new Democratic Governor Augustus H. Garland who was inaugurated November 12, 1874, and Baxter left office after only serving two years of a four-year term.

It was a long time after the Brooks–Baxter War that people of Arkansas allowed another Republican to become governor. The following 35 governors of Arkansas, ruling for a total of 90 years, were all Democrats, until Republican Winthrop Rockefeller became governor in 1966 defeating James D. Johnson. Winthrop became governor while his brother Nelson was governor of New York, while the defeat of Johnson in Arkansas and William M. Rainach in Louisiana ended the once mighty hold of segregation over politics.

<doc id="303572" wikidata="Q4972099" url="?curid=303572" title="Broadcast auxiliary service">
<text>A broadcast auxiliary service (BAS) is any radio frequency system used by a radio station or TV station, which is not part of its direct broadcast to listeners or viewers. These are essentially internal-use backhaul channels not intended for actual reception by the public, but part of the airchain required to get those signals back to the broadcast studio from the field. usually to be integrated into a live production.

Examples include:
*studio/transmitter link (STL)
*transmitter/studio link (TSL)
*remote pickup unit (RPU)
*electronic news gathering (ENG)

Several of these bands exist, but the most frequently used band is the 2 GHz microwave BAS band for point-to-point transmission from mobile newsgathering units to mountaintop receivers.

Seven 12-MHz wide channels exist in the band. In North America, DVB-T, precisely the same modulation technique as European Broadcast, is used, using a constellation of QPSK, 16QAM, or 64QAM, enabling sufficient digital bandwidths at 6 MHz deviation for transmission of an MPEG transport stream at 10 or more megabits per second, producing three &quot;lower&quot;, &quot;center&quot;, and &quot;upper&quot; overlapping 6 MHz channels within each 12 MHz channel.
==2 GHz relocation==
In the United States between 2005 and 2010, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) moved TV channels in the 2 GHz TV BAS band at the request of Sprint Nextel, so that it could use a portion which was adjacent to PCS frequencies it already uses. The report and order resulting from this rulemaking specified that Sprint/Nextel must pay for every TV station using the band to buy and install new BAS equipment to work in the new band structure.

Previously, there had been seven analog TV channels, each 17 or 18 MHz wide, between 1990 and 2110 MHz. The new allocation created seven digital TV channels, each 12 MHz wide, from 2025.5 to 2109.5 MHz. (There was also a &quot;narrowed in place&quot; bandplan used as an interim measure, as the two bands overlap.)
Begun in 2005, the relocation was 94% complete as of October 2008, and was expected to be fully complete in mid 2009. After multiple extensions granted by the FCC, it was finally done in July 2010, with the completion of the Anchorage, Alaska TV market. 

The cleared band is now used for PCS, AWS, and MSS services, including mobile broadband.

<doc id="303586" wikidata="Q1500739" url="?curid=303586" title="Shinui">
<text>Shinui () was a Zionist, secular, and anti-clerical free market liberal party and political movement in Israel. The party twice became the third-largest in the Knesset, but both occasions were followed by a split and collapse; in 1977, the party won 15 seats as part of the Democratic Movement for Change, but the alliance split in 1978, and Shinui was reduced to two seats at the next elections. In 2003, the party won 15 seats alone, but lost them all three years later after most of its MKs left to form new parties. The party was a member of Liberal International until 2009.

Though it had been the standard-bearer of economic liberalism and secularism in Israel for 30 years, the formation of Kadima robbed Shinui of its natural constituency, and in January 2006 the party split into small factions, none of which managed to overcome the 2% threshold needed to enter the Knesset.

==History==

===1970s===
As Israel made its transition from a developing nation into an economically prosperous one, a highly educated middle class emerged, tracing its historical political orientation to Labor Zionism. Many of these Israelis banded together to form Shinui.

Shinui was established by business people and academics in 1974, following the 1973 Arab–Israeli Yom Kippur War, which shook the Israeli public. Prior to the 1977 elections, it formed an alliance with several other small liberal parties. Initially, the party was called Democrats–Shinui, but was soon changed to the &quot;Democratic Movement for Change&quot;, and, as with many parties in Israel, became popularly known by its acronym, &quot;Dash&quot;. The new party caught the public&#x27;s imagination, with over 37,000 people signing up as members within a few weeks of its foundation. It also pioneered the use of primaries to choose its electoral list, something that was intended to show its democratic credentials and prevent cronyism. Previously, in Israel, party lists had been decided upon by the parties&#x27; committees, but since the late 1970s, many parties in Israel (excluding the ultra-Orthodox parties Shas and United Torah Judaism, and the centrist parties like Yesh Atid, Hosen, Telem, and Kulanu) have followed Dash&#x27;s lead and adopted the primaries system.

The new party won 15 seats, the best performance by the third party since the 1961 elections. This made it the third-largest party after Menachem Begin&#x27;s Likud and the Alignment, which had shrunk from 51 to 32 seats. However, Begin was still able to form a narrow 61-seat right-wing coalition with Shlomtzion (Ariel Sharon&#x27;s party), the National Religious Party, and Agudat Israel.

Dash were invited into the coalition in November 1977, five months after the Knesset term had started. The party picked up several ministerial portfolios: Meir Amit was made Minister of Transportation and Minister of Communications, Shmuel Tamir became Minister of Justice, and Yigael Yadin was named as Deputy Prime Minister. However, the fact that Dash did not control the balance of power led to internal disagreements over its role. The alliance began to disintegrate, finally splitting in three on 14 September 1978, with seven MKs breaking away to from the Movement for Change and Initiative, which was later renamed Shinui, another seven founding the Democratic Movement, and Assaf Yaguri creating Ya&#x27;ad. Shinui (including Amit) and Ya&#x27;ad left the coalition, whilst the Democratic Movement, which included Tamir and Yadin, remained in the government. Two Shinui MKs defected to the Alignment, leaving the party with five seats in 1981.

===1980s===
In the 1981 elections, the party was reduced to two seats. In 1984, they won three seats, and were invited to join the national unity government, but pulled out of the coalition on 26 May 1987. Although the party gained an MK from the Alignment, it lost Mordechai Virshubski to Ratz. The party was renamed Shinui – The Center Party during certain periods.

By 1985, Liberal International was considering admitting Shinui as a member in place of the Liberal Party. While the Liberal Party had formed an alliance with Herut in the Likud bloc, Shinui was dovish and allied with the Labor Alignment. Shinui joined Liberal International as a member in 1986.

===1990s===
In the 1988 elections, Shinui presented a joint list with the New Liberal Party, and was reduced to two seats. Although the party gained an MK from the Alignment, they lost another to Ratz. However, in 1992, it joined with Ratz and Mapam to form the leftist alliance, Meretz. Meretz won 12 seats in the 1992 elections, and was Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s major coalition partners in his Labor-led government.

In 1996, the three parties decided to officially merge to form a united Meretz party. Although Shinui leader Amnon Rubinstein supported the merger, most party members sought to distance themselves from the leftist social-democratic elements in Meretz. Two MKs (out of the nine Meretz won in the 1996 elections) broke away to re-establish Shinui as an independent party in 1997 under the leadership of Avraham Poraz. In the run-up to the 1999 elections, the party&#x27;s first independent electoral contest in 11 years, Poraz tried to brand the party as a representative of the middle class, and focused on reducing government intervention in the economy and tax burdens. However, this approach did not yield the party any new voters, and opinion polls predicted that Shinui would not make it past the threshold.

Meanwhile, Avraham Poraz&#x27;s views and political activities, combined with his distance from Meretz&#x27;s leftist stances and lack of public association between the two, won the support of TV celebrity Tommy Lapid, who was known for his fierce rhetoric against religious coercion. As a result of last-minute negotiations between the two, the party changed its name to Shinui – the Secular Movement, and reserved the most electable positions on the Shinui list to Lapid and his associates at the expense of established Shinui members. For example, Lapid himself, who was not a party member at the time, was given the first place on the list, traditionally reserved to the party leader, while Poraz (who remained Shinui&#x27;s formal party leader) was relegated to second place.

In the elections, Shinui won 6 seats, and announced its refusal to join any coalition that includes the ultra-Orthodox parties Shas and United Torah Judaism. As a result of this relative success in the 1999 elections, Lapid and his representatives formally joined the Shinui party, with the party leadership passing from Poraz to Lapid.

===2000s===
In the 2003 elections, the party won 15 seats, making it the third-largest in the Knesset. Ariel Sharon invited the party to form a secular coalition, with Shinui taking several key ministerial positions, including the Internal Affairs ministry, a key position in the secular-religious struggle. The party used its bargaining power to close down the Religious Affairs ministry.

Shinui presented itself as centrist on security issues.

====Paritzky affair====
In July 2004, a tape recording of Shinui MK and Minister of Infrastructure Yosef Paritzki was exposed by Ayala Hasson. In the tape, Paritzki was heard to ask a private investigator to investigate the actions of his Shinui colleague Avraham Poraz. The private investigator was probably paid by the workers&#x27; union of Israel&#x27;s Power Company (IPC), which wanted to prevent a law bill by Poraz denying the IPC workers many privileges they currently hold.

In response, Shinui publicly denounced and condemned Paritzki, and asked Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to fire Paritzki from the cabinet, and called on Paritzki to resign from the Knesset and leave Shinui. Paritzki refused, and blamed Shinui and other factors in a plot against him; he eventually formed his own party, Tzalash. A criminal investigation was ended without any indictment or any further legal proceedings.

====Religious parties join the coalition====
In August 2004, Sharon initiated coalition negotiations with several other parties after he lost the government majority required to support his disengagement plan. Although he preferred to form a Likud–Labor–Shinui &quot;secular unity&quot; government, this was thwarted by Likud MKs. Sharon then started negotiations with Shas and United Torah Judaism (UTJ). Although Shinui had vowed not to sit in a coalition with either party, after significant pressure from Sharon, and to avoid being blamed for thwarting the implementation of the disengagement plan, Lapid retracted his vow, and agreed to let UTJ join the coalition if they would agree to the government&#x27;s principles.

====Shinui out of the cabinet====
On 1 December 2004, Shinui voted against Sharon&#x27;s 2005 budget, which included subsidies to UTJ projects. In response, Sharon fired the Shinui ministers from the cabinet. On 10 January 2005, Labor joined the coalition, replacing Shinui. However, the party continued to support the disengagement and Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu&#x27;s financial reforms. Following its departure from the government, the party formed a Shadow cabinet and was renamed Shinui – Party for the Secular and the Middle Class.

====Poraz affair and party split====
In June 2005, Poraz was confronted by party activists who accused him and Lapid of dictatorial control of the party, and was recorded by them offering vacation flights out of the country and other financial favours. The tape reached &quot;Maariv&quot;, which at the time was running its &quot;Where is the Shame&quot; anti-corruption campaign led by its editor Amnon Dankner and top columnist Dan Margalit. However, the affair generated little publicity, as the party was outside the government. Nevertheless, the issues were brought to a head in September 2005 when Rubinstein criticized Lapid for stifling criticism and not engaging efforts to expand the party&#x27;s membership.
On 12 January 2006, the party held internal primary elections in preparation for the elections that year. In a surprise result, Ron Levintal beat Poraz in the contest for second place on the party&#x27;s list behind Lapid (who was re-elected with 53% of the votes). This resulted in the party splitting, with five MKs (Poraz, Ilan Shalgi, Meli Polishook-Bloch, Eti Livni, and Roni Brizon) leaving the party to form a new party they claimed would represent the &quot;real Shinui&quot;. On 25 January, Lapid resigned as party chairman, and left the party, declaring it no longer worthy of support. By then, a total of eleven MKs had left Shinui and formed a new party, the Secular Faction (later renamed Hetz), led by Poraz and supported by Lapid. After Yigal Yasinov also left the party, Shinui was left with only two MKs, Ehud Rassabi and Ilan Leibovitch.

Before the elections, Levintal made several conciliatory gestures toward Hetz, attempting negotiations with them, the anti-corruption Tafnit party led by Uzi Dayan, and former Prime Minister Ehud Barak over the prospect of forming a united front, but to no avail. In the election, Shinui won just 4,675 votes, 0.16% of the total, well below the 2% (62,741 votes) electoral threshold. Hetz won only 10,113 votes, meaning that both parties lost their Knesset representation.

====Since the 2006 Knesset elections====
The party did not run in the 2009 Knesset elections, and has not run in any subsequent national elections. It participated in combination with other parties, however, in the 2008 municipal elections in Haifa (led by Shlomo Gilboa), and won two seats. Shinui also participated in Tel Aviv-Yafo under the name Tel Avivim (led by Ron Levintal), but did not win any seats.

In 2012, Tommy Lapid&#x27;s son, Yair Lapid, formed Yesh Atid, a secularist, centrist, liberal Zionist party that won 19 seats in the 2013 Knesset elections, making it the Knesset&#x27;s second-largest party, and 11 seats in the 2015 Knesset elections. Yesh Atid is widely considered to be in the same tradition as Shinui, and has largely absorbed its electoral base.

==Ideology==

===Religion and state===
Despite nearly 30 years of public support of liberal-capitalist economic and social policies, its best known platform plank is a call for separation of religion and state within the confines of Zionist ideology. It demands civil marriage (although it has opposed a bill to enact it in March 2004), the operation of public transportation, businesses, theaters, etc., on Shabbat, removal of laws concerning selling and importing non-kosher food, drafting of ultra-Orthodox Jews into the IDF, and a halt to payments to yeshiva students.

Because of such demands, and the inflammatory tone of its current leadership, it was sometimes accused of being anti-religious or hating the religious, and so, some, including many secular people who would otherwise agree with its platform, would not vote for it. The party&#x27;s official position was that it does not oppose religion, but merely seeks to mend the inequities that exist because of religion. Their television campaign for the 2006 elections showed ultra-Orthodox Jews dragging onto secular voter, and as the secular man votes for Shinui, all the ultra-Orthodox vanish in midair.

Shinui supported gay rights, and conforming to its liberal orientation, Shinui adopted a unanimous resolution to create an in-party forum for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people.

===Economy===
Economically, Shinui supported a free market, privatization of public assets, and a lowering of taxes, especially taxes on the upper class. The party also objected to the introduction of a progressive estate tax.

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===
Shinui&#x27;s position on Israeli–Palestinian conflict was in accord with the mainstream centrist consensus. It supported achieving peace with the Palestinians even at the cost of territorial concessions. Shinui also supported the anti-terrorist policies of Ariel Sharon&#x27;s government, such as the killing of Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin.

Shinui supported negotiation with the Palestinians concerning the final status and a Palestinian state, which would include removal of Israeli settlements and withdrawal from most of the West Bank and Gaza. It asserted that both the Right and Left misled the public - the Right by claiming that only force will solve the problem, and the Left by claiming that there is a Palestinian partner for peace.

Shinui strongly supported the Israeli West Bank barrier and the disengagement plan.

===Political ethics and the fight against corruption===
Shinui proclaimed itself as a defender of political purity and lawful conduct. It promised to set an example for an uncorrupted party whose members are not suspected of involvement in criminal activity or financial irregularities. Shinui saw itself as an antithesis to Shas, many of whose MKs have been convicted in various corruption probes. Accordingly, Lapid requested and received the Justice and Internal Affairs ministries when in government (the latter having been formerly held by Shas). Shinui also frequently praised the Supreme Court of Israel as a guardian of the law and moral values.

==The 42nd GRAMMY LOGO==
The design of the 42nd GRAMMY AWARDS logo, was commissioned to Mark Deitch and Associates. The actual design was conceived and executed by Raoul Pascual of WYNK Marketing. Michael Green of the Recording Academy stipulated that the logo should encompass all forms of musical genre and (whatever the design) the GRAMMY logo had to be prominently featured. Raoul&#x27;s concept was to represent music with some of its major instruments: the clarinet for woodwinds, the piano for percussion, the guitar for strings plus a microphone:

&quot;I imagined all the instruments emanating from behind the logo. My problem was how to translate that into a visual. I designed black and white icons of the instruments using a vector program. I was working overtime and I was getting desperate. I was moving the different icons around the GRAMMY logo but none of the combinations seemed to work. As I picked up the guitar icon, I decided to pray and make a deal with God. I said &#x27;if you bless me with a winning design, I will give you the glory every time I share how I designed the GRAMMY logo.&#x27; Suddenly, I inadvertently released my hold of the icon and it fell on top of the GRAMMY logo. I stared at the image on my screen and I saw my solution. I added the other icons and curved them to suggest movement from behind. Eureka! That was it!&quot;

With suggestions from the staff and the people at the Recording Academy in the course of several weeks, the design underwent an evolution from a 2 dimensional rendering into 3D.

<text>Edgar Dean &quot;Ed&quot; Mitchell (September 17, 1930 – February 4, 2016) was a United States Navy officer and aviator, test pilot, aeronautical engineer, ufologist, and NASA astronaut. As the Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 14 in 1971 he spent nine hours working on the lunar surface in the Fra Mauro Highlands region, and was the sixth person to walk on the Moon. He was the second Freemason to set foot on the Moon, after Buzz Aldrin.

Before becoming an astronaut, Mitchell earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Management from Carnegie Institute of Technology and entered the United States Navy in 1952. After being commissioned through the Officer Candidate School at Newport, Rhode Island, he served as a Naval Aviator. In 1961, he received his second bachelor&#x27;s degree, in aeronautical engineering, from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School and three years later earned his doctorate in Aeronautics and Astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). From 1965 to 1966, he attended the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School and graduated first in his class. During this period, he served as an instructor in advanced mathematics and navigation theory for astronaut candidates.

The legacy of his post-NASA scientific and parapsychology work is carried on through the Institute of Noetic Sciences.

==Early life and education==

Mitchell was born on September 17, 1930, in Hereford, Texas, to Joseph Thomas Mitchell (1910–1967) and Ollidean Margaret Mitchell ( Arnold; 1911–1977). He had three siblings: Joyce Alyene, who died in her infancy in 1933, Sandra Jo (1934–1988) and Jay Neely &quot;Coach&quot; (1937–2013), who was a member of the inaugural graduating class of the United States Air Force Academy in 1959, and a pilot with the United States Air Force (USAF), achieving the rank of colonel. He came from a ranching family that moved to New Mexico during the Depression and considered Artesia, New Mexico (near Roswell) as his hometown. He first learned to fly at 13, receiving his private pilot license at 16, and was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second highest rank, Life Scout. He was also a member of DeMolay International, part of the Masonic Fraternity, and was inducted into its Hall of Fame. Mitchell was a member of Artesia Lodge #29 in New Mexico. He enjoyed handball, tennis, and swimming, and his hobbies included scuba diving and soaring.

He graduated from Artesia High School in 1948. Mitchell received a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial management from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in 1952, where he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. That same year, he entered the United States Navy and completed basic training at San Diego Recruit Depot. While on active duty in the Navy, he earned a second bachelor&#x27;s degree, in aeronautical engineering, from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1961 and a Doctor of Science degree in aeronautics and astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1964.

He was married to Louise Randall from 1951 to 1972. Following their divorce, he married Anita Rettig in 1973. The couple divorced in 1984 when he began an affair with former &quot;Playboy&quot; model Sheilah Ledbetter. He was father to two children with Randall, adopted Rettig&#x27;s three children, and later was father to another child, this time with Ledbetter. Rettig served as chair of the Palm Beach County Republican Party, while Kimberly Mitchell (the eldest daughter from his union with Rettig) was a city commissioner in West Palm Beach, Florida. Ledbetter and Mitchell married in 1989 and divorced in 1999. He was survived by five children, nine grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

==Flight experience==
In May 1953, after completing instruction at the Officer Candidate School at Newport, Rhode Island, Mitchell was commissioned an Ensign. He completed flight training in July 1954 at Hutchinson, Kansas, was designated as a Naval Aviator and received the Daughters of the American Revolution Award for achieving the highest overall marks during flight training. After period of instruction from July to September 1954 at the Fleet Airborne Electronics Training Unit, U.S. Pacific Fleet, Mitchell was subsequently assigned to Patrol Squadron 29 (VP-29), flying land-based patrol planes, deployed to Okinawa.

From 1957 to 1958, Mitchell transitioned to carrier-based jet aircraft and flew the A3D Skywarrior while assigned to Heavy Attack Squadron Two (VAH-2) deployed aboard the aircraft carriers USS &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; and USS &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;. He qualified as a research pilot and flew with Air Development Squadron Five until 1959. Following the completion of his graduate studies, Mitchell served as Chief, Project Management Division of the Navy Field Office for the Manned Orbiting Laboratory from 1964 to 1965. From 1965 to 1966, he attended the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School for certification as a test pilot, graduating first in his class. During this period, Mitchell served as an instructor in advanced mathematics and navigation theory for astronaut candidates.

Mitchell accumulated 5,000 hours flight time, including 2,000 hours in jet aircraft.

==NASA career==


Mitchell was selected in 1966 as part of NASA&#x27;s fifth astronaut group. He was assigned to the support crew for Apollo 9, then was designated as backup Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 10. This placed him in rotation for Apollo 13, but his crew was switched to Apollo 14 so that Commander Alan Shepard, who had been grounded by a medical problem since the Gemini program, could train longer.

During the Apollo 13 crisis, Mitchell was a part of the Apollo 13 Mission Operations Team and as such was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard M. Nixon in 1970. He worked in an Apollo simulator to help bring the crew back. One issue he worked on was how to &quot;fly&quot; (meaning control the attitude of) the Lunar Module with an inert Apollo Command/Service Module attached to it. (Usually, it was the other way around, but the Service Module was damaged during that mission.)

He then went to serve as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 14, landing with Shepard aboard the Lunar Module &quot;Antares&quot; on February 5, 1971, in the hilly upland Fra Mauro Highlands region of the Moon. They stayed on the Moon for 33 hours, deployed and activated lunar surface scientific equipment and experiments, and collected almost 100 pounds of lunar samples for return to Earth. Other Apollo 14 achievements include: only use of the Mobile Equipment Transporter (MET); first successful use of color television with a new Vidicon tube; longest distance traversed on foot on the lunar surface; largest payload placed in lunar orbit; first use of shortened lunar orbit rendezvous techniques; and first extensive orbital science period conducted during CSM solo operations.

In completing his first space flight, Mitchell logged a total of 216 hours and 42 minutes in space. He was subsequently designated to serve as backup Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 16.

During the mission, he took photos, including the one with Shepard raising the American flag. In the photo, Mitchell&#x27;s shadow is cast over the lunar surface near the flag. That photo was listed on &quot;Popular Science&quot;″s photo gallery of the best astronaut selfies.

==Post-NASA career==
Mitchell&#x27;s interests included consciousness and paranormal phenomena. On his way back to Earth during the Apollo 14 flight he had a powerful savikalpa samādhi experience, and he claimed to have conducted private ESP experiments with his friends on Earth. The results of these experiments were published in the &quot;Journal of Parapsychology&quot; in 1971.

He retired from NASA and the U.S. Navy with the rank of captain in October 1972. Immediately thereafter, he founded Edgar D. Mitchell &amp; Associates of Monterey, California, a &quot;commercial organization promoting ecologically-pure products and services designed to alleviate planetary problems.&quot;

After moving to Atherton, California, he became founding chairman of the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in Palo Alto, California in 1973 for the purpose of consciousness research and other &quot;related phenomena&quot;. &quot;Science and religion have lived on opposite sides of the street now for hundreds of years,&quot; Mitchell said toward the end of his life. &quot;So here we are, in the twenty-first century, trying to put two faces of reality—the existence face and the intelligence or conscious face—into the same understanding. Body and mind, physicality and consciousness belong to the same side of reality.

Journalist Annie Jacobsen has asserted that Mitchell&#x27;s Mind Science Institute (a Los Angeles, California-based organization ultimately subsumed by the Institute of Noetic Sciences) was employed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as a surreptitious conduit for payments to Andrija Puharich and Uri Geller while the latter was evaluated by an SRI International research group (led by Harold E. Puthoff and Russell Targ) in 1972. In 1976, Mitchell attempted to secure additional funding for the SRI group&#x27;s remote viewing research in a private meeting with then-Director of Central Intelligence George H. W. Bush, who knew Mitchell socially. Although Bush demurred (citing post-Watergate investigations of the intelligence community), he suggested the pursuit of military sponsorship, leading to the formation of the Stargate Project in 1978.

From 1974 to 1978, he was president of the Palm Beach, Florida-based Edgar Mitchell Corporation. In 1975, he moved to nearby Lantana, Florida, where he resided for the rest of his life. He co-founded the Association of Space Explorers in 1983 and later served as chairman of the Mitchell Communications Company.

Mitchell&#x27;s heretofore undisclosed experimentation with LSD was reported by writer David Jay Brown in &quot;The New Science of Psychedelics: At the Nexus of Culture, Consciousness, and Spirituality&quot; (2013). Although he favorably compared the sensations of the psychedelic experience to his time in zero gravity, it remains unclear if his use preceded or followed Apollo 14.

In 1997, Mitchell was interviewed for NASA&#x27;s oral history program. In one excerpt from that, he talked about how he was drawn to the space program:
On June 29, 2011, the federal government of the United States filed a lawsuit against Mitchell in the United States district court in Miami, Florida after discovering that he placed a camera used on Apollo 14 for auction at the auction house Bonhams. The litigation requested the camera be returned to NASA. Mitchell&#x27;s position was that NASA had given him the camera as a gift upon the completion of the Apollo 14 mission. Bonhams withdrew the camera from auction. In October 2011, attorneys representing the government and Mitchell reached a settlement agreement, and Mitchell agreed to return the camera to NASA, which in turn would donate it for display at the National Air and Space Museum. On September 20, 2012, Congress enacted H.R. 4158, confirming full ownership rights of artifacts to astronauts on Apollo (and Mercury and Gemini) space missions.

===Remote healing===
Mitchell claimed that a teenage remote healer living in Vancouver and using the pseudonym &quot;Adam Dreamhealer&quot; helped him heal kidney cancer from a distance. Mitchell said that while he never had a biopsy, &quot;I had a sonogram and MRI that was consistent with renal carcinoma.&quot; Adam worked (distantly) on Mitchell from December 2003 until June 2004, when the &quot;irregularity was gone and we haven&#x27;t seen it since&quot;.

===Views on UFOs===
Mitchell publicly expressed his opinions that he was &quot;90 percent sure that many of the thousands of unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, recorded since the 1940s, belong to visitors from other planets&quot;. &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; conducted an interview with Mitchell on April 19, 1996, during which he discussed meeting with officials from three countries who claimed to have had personal encounters with extraterrestrials. He offered his opinion that the evidence for such &quot;alien&quot; contact was &quot;very strong&quot; and &quot;classified&quot; by governments, who were covering up visitations and the existence of alien beings&#x27; bodies in places such as Roswell, New Mexico. He further claimed that UFOs had provided &quot;sonic engineering secrets&quot; that were helpful to the U.S. government. Mitchell&#x27;s 1996 book, &quot;The Way of the Explorer&quot;, discusses his journey into mysticism and space.

In 2004, he told the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; that a &quot;cabal of insiders&quot; in the U.S. government were studying recovered alien bodies, and that this group had stopped briefing U.S. Presidents after John F. Kennedy. He said, &quot;We all know that UFOs are real; now the question is where they come from.&quot;

On July 23, 2008, Edgar Mitchell was interviewed on Kerrang Radio by Nick Margerrison. Mitchell claimed the Roswell crash was real and that aliens have contacted humans several times, but that governments have hidden the truth for 60 years, stating: &quot;I happen to have been privileged enough to be in on the fact that we&#x27;ve been visited on this planet, and the UFO phenomenon is real.&quot; In reply, a spokesman for NASA stated on the Skeptoid Podcast with Brian Dunning: &quot;NASA does not track UFOs. NASA is not involved in any sort of cover-up about alien life on this planet or anywhere in the universe. Dr Mitchell is a great American, but we do not share his opinions on this issue.&quot;

In an interview with Fox News on July 25, 2008, Mitchell clarified that his comments did not involve NASA, but quoted unnamed sources, since deceased, at Roswell who confided to him that the Roswell incident did involve an alien craft. Mitchell also claims to have subsequently received confirmation from an unnamed intelligence officer at the Pentagon.

In an interview for AskMen published March 6, 2014, Mitchell said that he had never seen a UFO, that no one had ever threatened him over his claims regarding UFOs, and that any statements about the covering up of UFOs being a worldwide cabal was &quot;just speculation on my part&quot;.

In 2015, Mitchell said in an interview with the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; that extraterrestrials &quot;had been attempting to keep us from going to war [with Russia] and help create peace on Earth.&quot; He also said that &quot;White Sands was a testing ground for atomic weapons—and that&#x27;s what the extraterrestrials were interested in. They wanted to know about our military capabilities.&quot;

===Other projects===
Edgar Mitchell appeared in the documentaries &quot;In the Shadow of the Moon&quot; (2007), &quot;The Phoenix Lights...We Are Not Alone&quot;, and &quot;The Living Matrix&quot; (2009).

Mitchell wrote several articles and essays as well as several books. In &quot;The Way of the Explorer&quot;, Mitchell proposed a dyadic model of reality.

He was the Advisory Board Chairman of the Institute for Cooperation in Space, co-founded by Carol Rosin, and a member of INREES.

Mitchell was one of the initial supporters of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, which would be a first step towards a &quot;world parliament&quot;.

==Death==
Mitchell died under hospice care in West Palm Beach, Florida, at the age of 85, on February 4, 2016, the eve of the 45th anniversary of his lunar landing. As Roosa and Shepard had died in the 1990s, Mitchell was the last surviving member of the Apollo 14 crew.

==In media==
In the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, Mitchell was played by Gary Cole.

He was the subject of a chapter of Chris Wright&#x27;s book &quot;No More Worlds to Conquer&quot;, which asks how people who are famed for one moment moved on with their life. In it he talked at length about his beliefs in extraterrestrial visitation, the power of the mind, and his certainty that his cancer had been cured &quot;by mind means&quot;.

The climactic scene of the 2004 documentary &quot;Astronauts Gone Wild&quot; features an interview with Mitchell. After filmmaker Bart Sibrel questions Mitchell about various aspects of footage from the Apollo 11 mission, Mitchell and his son threaten to murder Sibrel and his assistant.

<text>Zadie Smith (born Sadie; 25 October 1975) is an English novelist, essayist, and short-story writer. Her debut novel, &quot;White Teeth&quot; (2000), immediately became a best-seller and won a number of awards. She became a tenured professor in the Creative Writing faculty of New York University in September 2010.

==Early life and education ==
Zadie Smith was born on 25 October 1975 in Willesden to a Jamaican mother, Yvonne Bailey, and an English father, Harvey Smith, who was 30 years his wife&#x27;s senior. At the age of 14, she changed her name from Sadie to Zadie.

Smith&#x27;s mother grew up in Jamaica and emigrated to England in 1969. Smith&#x27;s parents divorced when she was a teenager. She has a half-sister, a half-brother, and two younger brothers (one is the rapper and stand-up comedian Doc Brown, and the other is the rapper Luc Skyz). As a child, Smith was fond of tap dancing, and in her teenage years, she considered a career in musical theatre. While at university, Smith earned money as a jazz singer, and wanted to become a journalist.

Smith attended the local schools, Malorees Junior School and Hampstead Comprehensive School, then King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where she studied English literature. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2000, Smith corrected a newspaper assertion that she left Cambridge with a double First. &quot;Actually, I got a Third in my Part Ones,&quot; she said. She graduated with upper second-class honours. While at university Smith auditioned unsuccessfully for the Cambridge Footlights.

At Cambridge, Smith published a number of short stories in a collection of new student writing called &quot;The Mays Anthology&quot;. They attracted the attention of a publisher, who offered her a contract for her first novel. She decided to contact a literary agent and was taken on by A. P. Watt. Smith returned to guest-edit the anthology in 2001.

==Career==
Smith&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;White Teeth&quot;, was introduced to the publishing world in 1997 before it was completed. On the basis of a partial manuscript, an auction for the rights began, which was won by Hamish Hamilton. Smith completed &quot;White Teeth&quot; during her final year at the University of Cambridge. Published in 2000, the novel immediately became a best-seller and received much acclaim. It was praised internationally and won a number of awards, among them the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Betty Trask Award. The novel was adapted for television in 2002.

In July 2000, Smith&#x27;s debut work was discussed in a controversial essay of literary criticism by James Wood entitled &quot;Human, All Too Inhuman&quot;, where Wood critiques the novel as part of a contemporary genre of hysterical realism where [i]nformation has become the new character&quot; and human feeling is absent from contemporary fiction. In an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in October 2001, Smith responded to the criticism by agreeing with the accuracy of the term and with Wood&#x27;s underlying argument that &quot;any novel that aims at hysteria will now be effortlessly outstripped&quot;. However, she rejected her debut being categorised alongside major authors such as David Foster Wallace, Salman Rushdie, and Don DeLillo, and the dismissal of their own innovations on the basis of being &quot;hysterical realism&quot;. Responding earnestly to Wood&#x27;s concerns about contemporary literature and culture, Smith described her own anxieties as a writer and argued that fiction should be &quot;not a division of head and heart, but the useful employment of both&quot;.

Smith served as writer-in-residence at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London and subsequently published, as editor, an anthology of sex writing, &quot;Piece of Flesh&quot;, as the culmination of this role.

Smith&#x27;s second novel, &quot;The Autograph Man&quot;, was published in 2002 and was a commercial success, although it was not as well received by critics as &quot;White Teeth&quot;.

After the publication of &quot;The Autograph Man&quot;, Smith visited the United States as a Fellow of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. She started work on a still-unreleased book of essays, &quot;The Morality of the Novel&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Fail Better&quot;), in which she considers a selection of 20th-century writers through the lens of moral philosophy. Some portions of this book presumably appear in the essay collection &quot;Changing My Mind&quot;, published in November 2009.

Smith&#x27;s third novel, &quot;On Beauty&quot;, was published in September 2005. It is set largely in and around Greater Boston. It attracted more acclaim than &quot;The Autograph Man&quot;: it was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, and won the 2006 Orange Prize for Fiction and the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award.

Later in the same year, Smith published &quot;Martha and Hanwell&quot;, a book that pairs two short stories about two troubled characters, originally published in &quot;Granta&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; respectively. Penguin published &quot;Martha and Hanwell&quot; with a new introduction by the author as part of their pocket series to celebrate their 70th birthday. The first story, &quot;Martha, Martha&quot;, deals with Smith&#x27;s familiar themes of race and postcolonial identity, while &quot;Hanwell in Hell&quot; is about a man struggling to cope with the death of his wife.

In December 2008 she guest-edited the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Today&quot; programme.

After teaching fiction at Columbia University School of the Arts, Smith joined New York University as a tenured professor of fiction in 2010.

Between March and October 2011, Smith was the monthly New Books reviewer for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. She is also a frequent contributor to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. In 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper asked Smith for her &quot;10 rules for writing fiction&quot;. Among them she declared: &quot;Tell the truth through whichever veil comes to hand – but tell it. Resign yourself to the lifelong sadness that comes from never being satisfied.&quot;

Smith&#x27;s novel &quot;NW&quot; was published in 2012. Set in the Kilburn area of north-west London, the title being a reference to the local postcode, NW6, the novel was shortlisted for the Royal Society of Literature&#x27;s Ondaatje Prize and the Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction. &quot;NW&quot; was made into a BBC television film with the same title, directed by Saul Dibb and adapted by Rachel Bennette. Starring Nikki Amuka-Bird and Phoebe Fox, the TV adaptation was broadcast on BBC Two on 14 November 2016.

In September 2013, Smith appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, with her book choice being Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot;.

In 2015, it was announced that Smith, along with her husband Nick Laird, was writing the screenplay for a science fiction movie to be directed by French filmmaker Claire Denis. Smith later said that her involvement in the film, titled &quot;High Life&quot;, had been overstated and that she had simply helped to polish the English dialogue for the film.

Smith&#x27;s fifth novel, &quot;Swing Time&quot;, was published in November 2016. It drew inspiration from Smith&#x27;s childhood love of tap dancing. It was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2017.

Smith is a contributor to Margaret Busby&#x27;s 2019 anthology &quot;New Daughters of Africa&quot; (as is her mother Yvonne Bailey-Smith).

Smith&#x27;s first collection of short stories, &quot;Grand Union&quot;, was published on 8 October 2019. In 2020 she published six essays in a collection entitled &quot;Intimations&quot;, the royalties from which she said she would be donating to the Equal Justice Initiative and New York’s COVID-19 emergency relief fund.

In 2021, Smith debuted her first play, &quot;The Wife of Willesden&quot;, which she wrote after learning that her borough in London, Brent, had been selected in 2018 as the 2020 London Borough of Culture. As the most famous current writer from Brent, Smith was the natural choice to author the piece. She chose to adapt &quot;The Wife of Bath&#x27;s Tale&quot; in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, recalling how she had translated Chaucer into contemporary English during her studies at Cambridge. The retelling replaces the pilgrimage with a pub crawl set in contemporary London, with the Wife of Bath becoming Alvita, a Jamaican-born British woman in her mid-50s who challenges her Auntie P&#x27;s traditional Christian views on sex and marriage. Like the original tale, Alvita is a woman who has had five husbands, her experiences with them ranging from pleasant to traumatic. The majority of the piece is spent on her talking to the people in the pub, in much the way that the Wife of Bath&#x27;s prologue is longer than the tale itself. To her, Alvita&#x27;s voice is a common one that she heard growing up in Brent, and thus writing this play was a natural choice for the festival. The tale itself is set in 17th-century Jamaica, where a man guilty of rape is brought before the Queen, who decrees that his punishment is to go and find what women truly desire.

In 2023, Smith stated that she had been writing a historical novel since 2020, focusing on Arthur Orton, who was at the centre of the Tichborne case, a famous 19th-century court case involving identity theft, but spans the period from 1830s to the 1870s (significant for the Reform Act 1932 and the abolition of slavery). She said that she tried to avoid Charles Dickens as an influence and subject, but that her research process showed her that there was &quot;really no way to entirely avoid Mr. Charles Dickens&quot; since several of the places and events of her story had a relation to him. The book also includes another real-life novelist of the time, William Ainsworth. Smith&#x27;s historical novel, &quot;The Fraud&quot;, was published in September 2023. 

Reviewing &quot;The Fraud&quot; for &quot;The Independent&quot;, Martin Chilton said: &quot;The novel pulls off the trick of being both splendidly modern and authentically old. ... &quot;The Fraud&quot; is the genuine article.&quot; According to Karan Mahajan, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;It offers a vast, acute panoply of London and the English countryside, and successfully locates the social controversies of an era in a handful of characters. ... Dickens may be dead, but Smith, thankfully, is alive.&quot; In a much longer review, putting The Fraud in context of Smith&#x27;s other writings, Colin Burrow in The London Review of Books, highlights its &quot;spiky delights&quot;. Burrow shows how &quot;Smith gives a fresh angle to this often-told tale [Tichborne case] by concentrating on a key witness in the trials: Andrew Bogle, a Black man who grew up enslaved in Jamaica. There he became the page of Edward Tichborne...who was the manager of the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos&#x27;s plantations around Kingston...Bogle himself remains the central enigma of the novel...Blowing a hole in earlier literature while feeling its weight is perhaps the main aim of The Fraud. Its restless movement between the 1830s and 1870s deliberately recalls the temporal span of Middlemarch&quot; by George Eliot.

In 2023, Smith was elected to the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences.

==Personal life==
Smith met Nick Laird at the University of Cambridge. They married in 2004 in King&#x27;s College Chapel, Cambridge. Smith dedicated &quot;On Beauty&quot; to &quot;my dear Laird&quot;. She also uses his name in passing in &quot;White Teeth&quot;: &quot;An&#x27; all the good-lookin&#x27; men, all the &quot;rides&quot; like your man Nicky Laird, they&#x27;re all dead.&quot;

The couple lived in Rome, Italy, from November 2006 to 2007, and later lived in New York City, USA and the Kilburn area of London. They have two children.

Smith describes herself as &quot;unreligious&quot;, and was not raised in a religion, although retains a &quot;curiosity&quot; about the role religion plays in others&#x27; lives. In an essay exploring humanist and existentialist views of death and dying, Smith characterises her worldview as that of a &quot;sentimental humanist&quot;.

Zadie Smith&#x27;s favourite book is &quot;Middlemarch&quot; by George Eliot. She tells Eleanor Wachtel, in an interview for &quot;Brick, A Literary Journal&quot;, that &quot;Middlemarch&quot; was &quot;just an extraordinary achievement in a novel. It&#x27;s so diverse and gigantic—its concentration is so diffuse. It&#x27;s a social novel, which England has always aspired to; at the same time, it&#x27;s a great philosophical novel, like its continental cousins.&quot;

<text>Soldier of Fortune (SOF), subtitled The Journal of Professional Adventurers, is a daily American web magazine founded in 1975 by Robert K. Brown. It began as a monthly U.S. periodical published from 1975 to 2016 as a magazine devoted to worldwide reporting of wars, including conventional warfare, low-intensity warfare, counter-insurgency, and counter-terrorism. It was published by Omega Group Ltd., based in Boulder, Colorado. In May 2022, author, editor, and security journalist Susan Katz Keating bought the publication from Brown with the help of her partner Pierre Hollis.

==History==
&quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; magazine was founded in 1975, by Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Army Reserve, (Ret.) Robert K. Brown, who served with Special Forces in Vietnam. After retiring from active duty, Brown began publishing a “circular”, magazine-type publication with few pages which contained information on mercenary employment in Oman, which had recently undergone a coup and was battling a communist insurgency. Brown&#x27;s small circular soon evolved into a glossy, large-format, full-color magazine.

Significant to the early development of &quot;SOF&quot; was its role in the recruitment of foreign nationals to serve in the Rhodesian Security Forces, during the Rhodesian Bush War (1964–79). By 1976, &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; was selling 120,000 copies per month, making it into one of the most popular American magazines of the 1970s. &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; was ostensibly intended for mercenaries and &quot;professional adventurers&quot;, but Brown admitted that the majority of the readers of &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; were the &quot;Walter Mitty market&quot;, referring to weak, insecure men who merely fantasized about being macho mercenaries. 

In 2018, American historian Kyle Burke described the popularity of &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; as due to a white male backlash against the rise of feminism and the rise of civil rights movement, as he noted that the majority of the readers of &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; were white men who resented feminists and &quot;uppity&quot; non-white people, especially African Americans. The stories in &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; describing with great relish how a mere handful of white mercenaries could almost effortlessly defeat hordes of black guerrillas were thinly veiled racist fantasies that were meant to establish the superiority of white men over black men. Likewise, the stories in &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; celebrated the machismo and womanizing of the mercenary sub-culture as the male ideal.

Burke described Brown as a &quot;passionate supporter&quot; of the white supremacist government of Rhodesia, and &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; glorified Rhodesia as a place where it was still possible to &quot;Be a Man Among Men&quot;. From 1972 onward, the white supremacist government of Rhodesia was engaged in a war against the black guerrillas of the Soviet-backed Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) and the Chinese-backed Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). A major problem for Rhodesia was the black population vastly outnumbered the white population. Most of the white population of Rhodesia had only arrived in the years 1955–1960, meaning their roots in Rhodesia were not that deep. 

During the Bush War, about 13,395 whites left Rhodesia annually, which were losses that Rhodesia could ill afford, given the small number of whites compared to blacks. The white flight caused by the Bush War led to the Rhodesian Army having significant problems in maintaining enough white soldiers to continue the war. The Rhodesian military had much difficulty in replacing men killed or wounded in the war, and by 1977 the Rhodesian security forces had been pushed to their breaking point by manpower shortages. By 1977, the Rhodesian security forces were on the defensive and had been forced to cede control of vast areas of rural Rhodesia to the ZIPRA and ZANLA guerrillas, owing to manpower shortages. Rhodesia was trapped in a vicious circle, as the Rhodesian forces lost of control more of the countryside, and more whites chose to leave. As the &quot;white flight&quot; continued, the more the Rhodesians continued to lose. 

Unlike South Africa whose white population was both larger and longer established, Rhodesia was highly dependent upon recruiting white men from aboard to replace its losses in the war. Brown was inspired to found &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; in 1975 after a visit to Rhodesia, where an American friend, a veteran of the Vietnam war who was now serving the para-military British South Africa Police, which despite its name was the police force of Rhodesia, who told him that Rhodesia was losing the war because of a shortage of white manpower.

Brown was well aware that Rhodesia was losing the Bush War and used &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; as a forum to recruit soldiers for Rhodesia. Brown worked closely with the chief recruiting officer of the Rhodesian Army, Major Nick Lamprecht, on using &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; to recruit white American men for the Rhodesian Army. Lamprecht wrote in an article in &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; urging white American men to come to fight for Rhodesia, writing that: &quot;Rhodesia has many things to offer. Good Rhodesian beer, a friendly populace, and what I would describe as a free and easy, unhurried way of life, lots of wide open spaces&quot;. 

As a further inducement, Lamprecht promised that it would be easy for single white men to find a suitable wife in Rhodesia. The stories about Rhodesia in &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; depicted Rhodesia as a paradise where women and black people still knew their place, as the articles urged their readers to enlist in the Rhodesian Army in order to defend Rhodesia against the black guerrillas. One story about Rhodesia stated: &quot;What we have here is an ideal core of white people who are able to raise the standards of living among the Africans. Without us, conditions will decline rapidly&quot;.

The quality of recruits that came to Rhodesia varied widely. Some such as L.H. &quot;Mike&quot; Williams and Michael Pierce, both veterans of the U.S. Army who had fought in Vietnam, had successful careers in the Rhodesian Army. One of the first Americans to go to Rhodesia was John Alan Corey, a veteran of the Vietnam war who joined the Rhodesian Light Infantry Regiment and who was killed in action in July 1975. Corey was celebrated as a martyr for freedom in an article in &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;, which approvingly published an excerpt from a letter written by Corey shortly before his death, where he declared: &quot;Since coming to Rhodesia, I have often heard people remark that it&#x27;s &quot;inevitable&quot; for this country and all of southern Africa to follow the &#x27;winds of change&#x27; and go the same way as the other former colonies to the north. This is rubbish and only indicates a lack of fighting spirit, guts and the will to rule a civilization built by better men&quot;. 

The reference to the &quot;winds of change&quot; in Corey&#x27;s letter was to a 1960 speech given by the British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in South Africa, where he stated that a &quot;wind of change&quot; was sweeping across Africa and that the &quot;apartheid&quot; system was doomed. The majority of the Americans who went to Rhodesia were not veterans of the Vietnam war nor had they served in the U.S. military. The majority of men who had never seen war before flinched in the face of its horrors and chose to desert. One article in &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; in 1979 complained: &quot;The majority found the routine too rough to last more than a few months. The desertion rate among the American citizens who have joined the Rhodesian Army over the last two years is estimated to run at about 80 percent&quot;.

In the late 1970s and the 1980s, the success and popularity of a military magazine such as &quot;SOF&quot; led to the proliferation of like magazines such as &quot;Survive&quot;, &quot;Gung Ho!&quot;, &quot;New Breed&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;Combat Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Special Weapons and Tactics&quot;, and &quot;Combat Ready&quot;. &quot;SOF&quot; was published by the Omega Group Ltd., in Boulder, Colorado. At the height of its circulation in the early 1980s the magazine had 190,000 subscribers. 

In the 1980s, &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; ran ads promising to take Americans to fight in Afghanistan, but few relatively actually went. The city of Peshawar on the Khyber Pass that forms one of the main routes into Afghanistan along the Afghan-Pakistani border was described being full of Americans who were &quot;Walter Mitty types&quot; who talked loudly of coming into Afghanistan. All of the available evidence suggests that only a small number of the American volunteers actually crossed the border, and of those who crossed the frontier, an even a smaller number survived Afghanistan and returned. 

More successful for &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; was its efforts to promote Americans to assist the Contra rebels against the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua, in part due to geographical proximity, and because the Central Intelligence Agency was more encouraging of American volunteers for the Contras. At a time when the Boland Amendment was in effect, which banned American assistance to the Contras, in May 1985 General John K. Singlaub recruited Brown to use &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; to recruit Americans who as private citizens would train and arm the Contras. The assignment was meant to provide the Reagan administration with the necessary &quot;plausible deniability&quot; that it was not attempting to circumvent Congress, which had banned assistance to the Contras. Singlaub retired from the U.S. Army in 1979, but he was working unofficially for the National Security Council in the 1980s, which he bombarded with various plans to overthrow the Sandinistas. 

Brown accepted the assignment and recruited several of the mercenaries he recruited to fight for Rhodesia in the 1970s to go with him to Honduras to train the Contras. Brown and his assorted mercenaries went to Camp Las Vegas on the Nicaraguan-Honduran border, along with a consignment of arms from the United States. Brown said of the Contras &quot;these people had no military training at all&quot; and stated his mission &quot;could hardly be called a resounding success&quot; as all of the Contras he had trained as spies were captured by the Sandinistas and executed. The Contra war in Nicaragua was covered extensively in &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; in the 1980s, but Brown did not mention that he had been hired to train the Contras and instead presented himself and the other mercenaries as journalists covering the war. 

=== Online magazine ===
The April 2016 issue of &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; was the final print edition. Further editions have been published online. The magazine is published by Soldier of Fortune LLC, co-owned by Susan Katz Keating.

In the online magazine, publisher Keating revived original reporting, and sent correspondents into the field in Ukraine, Serbia, Israel, and along the southern U.S. border with Mexico. She introduced a new section entitled The Fire Pit, where readers submit personal stories of war and adventure. Among those whose stories appear in the section are Gen.(Ret) Scott Miller, formerly the four-star general in charge of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Jan Scruggs, founder of the Vietnam Memorial Wall, along with numerous warfighters and veterans.

The magazine gained publicity in July 2023 when Keating published her investigative series on the cocaine packet that was discovered inside the Biden White House. The articles were picked up by Radar Online, the &quot;New York Post&quot;, and other outlets.

Keating was featured in a profile in The New Yorker Magazine, in an article that appeared online on September 2, 2024, and in print in the issue dated September 12, 2024. 

==&quot;Gun for Hire&quot; lawsuits==
During the late 1980s, &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; under Robert K. Brown was sued in civil court several times for having published classified advertisements by private &quot;guns for hire.&quot; In 1987, Norman Norwood of Arkansas sued &quot;SOF&quot; magazine because of injuries he suffered during a murder attempt by two men hired via a &quot;Gun for Hire&quot; advertisement in the magazine. The magazine settled the lawsuit out of court.

On February 20, 1985, John Wayne Hearn shot and killed Sandra Black for a $10,000 payment from her husband, Robert Vannoy Black Jr. Black connected with Hearn through a classified advertisement published in &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;, wherein Hearn solicited &quot;high-risk assignments. U.S. or overseas.&quot; In 1989, Sandra Black&#x27;s son Gary and her mother Marjorie Eimann filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against &quot;SOF&quot; magazine and its parent publishing company Omega Group Ltd., seeking $21 million in redress of their grievance.

The jury found the defendants grossly negligent in publishing Hearn&#x27;s ad for implicit illegal activity (murder) and awarded the plaintiffs $9.5 million in damages. In 1990, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the verdict, saying that the standard of conduct imposed upon the magazine was too high because the advertisement was ambiguously worded.

In 1989, four men were convicted of conspiracy to murder in the 1985 contract killing of Richard Braun of Atlanta, Georgia. The killers were hired through a classified services advertisement published in &quot;SOF&quot; magazine that read: &quot;GUN FOR HIRE.&quot; Braun&#x27;s sons filed a civil lawsuit against the magazine, and a jury found in their favor, awarding them $12.37 million in damages, which the judge later reduced to $4.37 million. In 1992, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld the judgment of the jury, saying &quot;the publisher could recognize the offer of criminal activity as readily as its readers did.&quot; In 1993, the United States Supreme Court allowed the judgment to stand when it refused to hear the case. The magazine subsequently suspended publication of classified advertisements.

In 2022, publisher Keating affirmed that under her watch, the magazine would not publish such advertisements.

<doc id="303604" wikidata="Q7252642" url="?curid=303604" title="Provincial Governors of Finland">
<text>The Governor (, or ) of a [[Provinces of Finland|province of Finland]] headed the activities of the State Provincial Office (, or ) until the end of 2009, when the provinces were abolished. The governors were appointed by the President. Many former ministers including but not limited to Kaarlo Hillilä, Martti Miettunen, Hannele Pokka and Anneli Taina served as governors, since the post was regarded as prestigious enough for a retiring minister, but still politically neutral. The title of &quot;maaherra&quot; was also considered a personal title, such that once appointed, the title &quot;maaherra&quot; remained for life.

During the Swedish period (1634–1809) and the Russian period (1809–1917) the governor was a royal plenipotentiary, representing the sovereign, but with independence, the function was reversed: the governor represented his territory to the central government.

<doc id="303605" wikidata="Q747675" url="?curid=303605" title="Lip gloss">
<text>Lip gloss is a cosmetic used primarily to give lips a glossy luster, and sometimes to add a subtle color. It is distributed as a fluid or a soft solid (not to be confused with lip balm, which generally has medical or soothing purposes, or lipstick, which generally is a solid, cream-like substance that gives off a more pigmented color.) The product is available in ranges of opacity from translucent to solid and can have variously frosted, glittery, glossy, and metallic finishes.

==Types==
Like lipstick, lip gloss comes in a variety of forms and may be applied in different ways. It can be contained in a small cylinder and applied with a rounded or sloped applicator wand (known as a doe foot applicator) or with a built in lip brush. It can come in a small, soft, squeezable plastic tube designed to be applied directly to the lips or applied with a fingertip or lip brush. Solid or semisolid glosses come in boxes or tubes and sometimes blur the distinction between lip gloss and lip balm. 

Basic lip gloss simply adds shine to the lips without color. Colored lip gloss adds a combination of color and shine. Glittery lip gloss has a glitter base, with or without color. 

New types of &quot;plumping&quot; lip gloss contain ingredients that make the lips appear softer and plumper. These are a cheap, easy, and usually harmless alternative if compared to collagen, Restylane, Juvederm, or fat injections. Such lip glosses are popularly known as lifter glosses. They are not as effective, however because the effects are temporary. Plumping lip gloss can also leave a burning sensation on the lips when first applied. 

Lip gloss is often used when a person wants to have some color on their lips, but does not want an intense, solid lip color effect (i.e., a more &quot;made-up&quot; look), as a lipstick would create. Lip gloss is also often used as an introduction to makeup. You can find light shimmery lip glosses in many introduction to makeup kits. It is often used by preteen and young teenage girls who want to wear some makeup, but are too young to wear more intense lipstick colors. It is also common for young women who do not like to wear makeup but have to attend a formal occasion. It can be applied on top of lipstick to increase the gloss of a color, or to add depth as in the case of glitter gloss.

==Ingredients==
Like lipstick, lip gloss is a mixture of waxes, oils, and pigments. However, lip gloss contains fewer pigments, and those used are often pale in color or diluted (&lt;3%). Furthermore, the free-flowing nature of the product requires less wax. The principal components are lanolin, which feels good on the lips due to its moisturizing qualities and imparts gloss, and polybutene.

==History==
Lip gloss was invented by [Max Factor] in 1930. He wanted to create a lip product that would make lips shiny and glossy for films. Factor created makeup for the movie industry. He developed makeup specifically for actresses starring in black and white films. Women were inspired by movie actresses to embrace this makeup trend. This led to the popularity of lip gloss. The first commercially available lip gloss was Max Factor&#x27;s X-Rated, launched in 1932. The original formula was sold until 2003, when Procter and Gamble retired the product.

In 1973, Bonne Bell introduced the first flavored lip gloss, Lip Smackers. Lip Smackers was, and still is, popular among young teenagers. Initially Lip Smackers came in two sizes: small and big. The small ones could be kept in the pocket and the big ones had a rope to hang around the neck. It was advertised that before a date, a teen girl should choose an appropriate flavor because that would be her date&#x27;s first taste when his lips kissed hers.

<doc id="303611" wikidata="Q200667" url="?curid=303611" title="Ladakh">
<text>Ladakh () is a region administered by India as a union territory and constitutes an eastern portion of the larger Kashmir region that has been the subject of a dispute between India and Pakistan since 1947 and India and China since 1959. Ladakh is bordered by the Tibet Autonomous Region to the east, the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh to the south, both the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan to the west, and the southwest corner of Xinjiang across the Karakoram Pass in the far north. It extends from the Siachen Glacier in the Karakoram range to the north to the main Great Himalayas to the south. The eastern end, consisting of the uninhabited Aksai Chin plains, is claimed by the Indian Government as part of Ladakh, but has been under Chinese control.

In the past, Ladakh gained importance from its strategic location at the crossroads of important trade routes, but as Chinese authorities closed the borders between Tibet Autonomous Region and Ladakh in the 1960s, international trade dwindled. Since 1974, the Government of India has successfully encouraged tourism in Ladakh. As Ladakh is strategically important, the Indian military maintains a strong presence in the region.

The largest town in Ladakh is Leh, followed by Kargil, each of which headquarters a district. The Leh district contains the Indus, Shyok and Nubra river valleys. The Kargil district contains the Suru, Dras and Zanskar river valleys. The main populated regions are the river valleys, but the mountain slopes also support pastoral Changpa nomads. The main religious groups in the region are Muslims (mainly Shia) (46%), Buddhists (mainly Tibetan Buddhists) (40%), and Hindus (12%) with the remaining 2% made of other religions. Ladakh is one of the most sparsely populated regions in India. Its culture and history are closely related to those of Tibet.

Ladakh was established as a union territory of India on 31 October 2019, following the passage of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act. Prior to that, it was part of the Jammu and Kashmir state. Ladakh is both the largest and the second least populous union territory of India.

== Names and their etymology==
The classical name in means the &quot;land of high passes&quot;. &quot;Ladak&quot; is its pronunciation in several Tibetan dialects. The English spelling &quot;Ladakh&quot; is derived from .

The region was previously known as Maryul (see page for etymology).

Medieval Islamic scholars called Ladakh the &quot;Great Tibet&quot; (derived from Turko-Arabic &quot;Ti-bat&quot;, meaning &quot;highland&quot;); Baltistan and other trans-Himalayan states in Kashmir&#x27;s vicinity were referred to as &quot;Little Tibets&quot;.

It has also been called Ma-Lo-Pho (by Hiuen Tsang) or Lal Bhumi. Names in the local language include Kanchapa (&quot;Land of snow&quot;) and Ripul (&quot;Country of mountains&quot;).

== History ==
=== Ancient history ===
Rock carvings found in many parts of Ladakh indicate that the area has been inhabited from Neolithic times. Ladakh&#x27;s earliest inhabitants consisted of nomads known as Kampa. Later settlements were established by Mons from Kullu and Brokpas who originated from Gilgit. Around the 1st century, Ladakh was a part of the Kushan Empire. Buddhism spread into western Ladakh from Kashmir in the 2nd century. The 7th-century Buddhist traveller Xuanzang describes the region in his accounts. Xuanzang&#x27;s term of Ladakh is &quot;Mo-lo-so&quot;, which has been reconstructed by academics as &quot;*Malasa&quot;, &quot;*Marāsa&quot;, or &quot;*Mrāsa&quot;, which is believed to have been the original name of the region.

For much of the first millennium, western Tibet comprised Zhangzhung kingdom(s), which practised the Bon religion. Sandwiched between Kashmir and Zhangzhung, Ladakh is believed to have been alternatively under the control of one or other of these powers. Academics find strong influences of Zhangzhung language and culture in &quot;upper Ladakh&quot; (from the middle section of the Indus valley to the southeast). The penultimate king of Zhangzhung is said to have been from Ladakh.

From around 660 CE, the Tang dynasty and the Tibetan Empire started contesting the &quot;four garrisons&quot; of the Tarim Basin (present day Xinjiang), a struggle that lasted three centuries. Zhangzhung fell victim to Tibet&#x27;s ambitions in and disappeared. Karkota Empire and the Umayyad Caliphate too joined the contest for Xinjiang soon afterwards. Baltistan and Ladakh were at the centre of these struggles. Academics infer from the slant of Ladakhi chronicles that Ladakh may have owed its primary allegiance to Tibet during this time, but that it was more political than cultural. Ladakh remained Buddhist and its culture was not yet Tibetan.

=== Early medieval history ===

In the 9th century, Tibet&#x27;s ruler Langdarma was assassinated and Tibet fragmented. Kyide Nyimagon, Langdarma&#x27;s great-grandson, fled to West Tibet , and founded a new West Tibetan kingdom at the heart of the old Zhangzhung, now called Ngari in the Tibetan language.
Nyimagon&#x27;s eldest son, Lhachen Palgyigon, is believed to have conquered the regions to the north, including Ladakh and Rutog. After the death of Nyimagon, his kingdom was divided among his three sons, Palgyigon receiving Ladakh, Rutog, Thok Jalung and an area referred to as Demchok Karpo (a holy mountain near the present-day Demchok village). The second son received Guge–Purang (called &quot;Ngari Korsum&quot;) and the third son received Zanskar and Spiti (to the southwest of Ladakh). This three-way division of Nyimagon&#x27;s empire was recognised as historic and remembered in the chronicles of all the three regions as a founding narrative.
He gave to each of his sons a separate kingdom, viz., to the eldest &quot;Dpal-gyi-gon&quot;, &quot;Maryul&quot; of &quot;Mngah-ris&quot;, the inhabitants using black bows; &quot;ru-thogs&quot; [Rutog] of the east and the Gold-mine of &quot;Hgog&quot; [possibly Thok Jalung]; nearer this way &quot;Lde-mchog-dkar-po&quot; [Demchok Karpo]; ...

The first West Tibetan dynasty of Maryul founded by Palgyigon lasted five centuries, being weakened towards its end by the conquests of the Mongol/Mughal noble Mirza Haidar Dughlat. Throughout this period the region was called &quot;Maryul&quot;, possibly from the original proper name &quot;*Mrasa&quot; (Xuangzhang&#x27;s, &quot;Mo-lo-so&quot;), but in the Tibetan language it was interpreted to mean &quot;lowland&quot; (the lowland of Ngari). Maryul remained staunchly Buddhist during this period, having participated in the second diffusion of Buddhism from India to Tibet via Kashmir and Zanskar.

=== Medieval history ===


Between the 1380s and early 1510s, many Islamic missionaries propagated Islam and proselytised the Ladakhi people. Sayyid Ali Hamadani, Sayyid Muhammad Nur Baksh and Mir Shamsuddin Iraqi were three important Sufi missionaries who propagated Islam to the locals. Mir Sayyid Ali was the first one to make Muslim converts in Ladakh and is often described as the founder of Islam in Ladakh. Several mosques were built in Ladakh during this period, including in Mulbhe, Padum and Shey, the capital of Ladakh. His principal disciple, Sayyid Muhammad Nur Baksh also propagated Islam to Ladakhis and the Balti people rapidly converted to Islam. Noorbakshia Islam is named after him and his followers are only found in Baltistan and Ladakh. During his youth, Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin expelled the mystic Sheikh Zain Shahwalli for showing disrespect to him. The sheikh then went to Ladakh and proselytised many people to Islam. In 1505, Shamsuddin Iraqi, a noted Shia scholar, visited Kashmir and Baltistan. He helped in spreading Shia Islam in Kashmir and converted the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Baltistan to his school of thought.
It is unclear what happened to Islam after this period and it seems to have received a setback. Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat who invaded and briefly conquered Ladakh in 1532, 1545 and 1548, does not record any presence of Islam in Leh during his invasion although Shia Islam and Noorbakshia Islam continued to flourish in other regions of Ladakh.

King Bhagan reunited and strengthened Ladakh and founded the Namgyal dynasty (&quot;Namgyal&quot; means &quot;victorious&quot; in several Tibetan languages). The Namgyals repelled most Central Asian raiders and temporarily extended the kingdom as far as Nepal. During the Balti invasion led by Raja Ali Sher Khan Anchan, many Buddhist temples and artefacts were damaged. Ali Sher Khan took the king and his soldiers as captives. Jamyang Namgyal was later restored to the throne by Ali Sher Khan and given the hand of a Muslim princess in marriage. Her name was Gyal Khatun or Argyal Khatoom. She was to be the first queen and her son was to become the next ruler. Historical accounts differ upon who her father was. Some identify Ali&#x27;s ally and Raja of Khaplu Yabgo Shey Gilazi as her father, while others identify Ali himself as the father. In the early 17th century efforts were made to restore the destroyed artefacts and &quot;gonpas&quot; by Sengge Namgyal, the son of Jamyang and Gyal. He expanded the kingdom into Zangskar and Spiti. Despite a defeat of Ladakh by the Mughals, who had already annexed Kashmir and Baltistan, Ladakh retained its independence.

Islam begins to take root in the Leh area in the beginning of the 17th century after the Balti invasion and the marriage of Gyal to Jamyang. A large group of Muslim servants and musicians were sent along with Gyal to Ladakh and private mosques were built where they could pray. The Muslim musicians later settled in Leh. Several hundred Baltis migrated to the kingdom and according to oral tradition many Muslim traders were granted land to settle. Many other Muslims were invited over the following years for various purposes.

In the late 17th century, Ladakh sided with Bhutan in its dispute with Tibet which, among other reasons, resulted in its invasion by the Tibetan Central Government. This event is known as the Tibet–Ladakh–Mughal war of 1679–1684. Kashmiri historians assert that the king converted to Islam in return for the assistance by Mughal Empire after this, however, Ladakhi chronicles do not mention such a thing. The king agreed to pay tribute to the Mughals in return for defending the kingdom. The Mughals, however, withdrew after being paid off by the 5th Dalai Lama. With the help of reinforcements from Galdan Boshugtu Khan, Khan of the Zungar Empire, the Tibetans attacked again in 1684. The Tibetans were victorious and concluded a treaty with Ladakh then they retreated back to Lhasa in December 1684. The Treaty of Tingmosgang in 1684 settled the dispute between Tibet and Ladakh but severely restricted Ladakh&#x27;s independence.

=== Princely state of Jammu and Kashmir ===


In 1834, the Sikh Zorawar Singh, a general of Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu, invaded and annexed Ladakh to Jammu under the suzerainty of the Sikh Empire. After the defeat of the Sikhs in the First Anglo-Sikh War, the state of Jammu and Kashmir was established as a separate princely state under British suzerainty. The Namgyal family was given the &quot;jagir&quot; of Stok, which it nominally retains to this day. European influence began in Ladakh in the 1850s and increased. Geologists, sportsmen, and tourists began exploring Ladakh. In 1885, Leh became the headquarters of a mission of the Moravian Church.

Ladakh was administered as a &quot;wazarat&quot; under Dogra rule, with a governor termed &quot;wazir-e-wazarat&quot;. It had three tehsils, based at Leh, Skardu and Kargil. The headquarters of the &quot;wazarat&quot; was at Leh for six months of the year and at Skardu for six months. When the legislative assembly, called &quot;Praja Sabha&quot;, was established in 1934, Ladakh was given two nominated seats in the assembly.

Ladakh was claimed as part of Tibet by Phuntsok Wangyal, a Tibetan Communist leader.

=== Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir ===
At the time of the partition of India in 1947, the Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh chose to remain independent of India or Pakistan. Pakistani soldiers from Gilgit invaded in October and had reached Ladakh. To get defence assistance from India, Singh was told by Nehru to sign the Instrument of Accession to India, and military operations were initiated to counter the invasion. The wartime conversion of the pony trail from Sonamarg to Zoji La by army engineers permitted tanks to move up and successfully capture the pass. The advance continued. Dras, Kargil and Leh were liberated and Ladakh cleared of the infiltrators.

In 1949, China closed the border between Nubra and Xinjiang, blocking old trade routes. In 1955 China began to build roads connecting Xinjiang and Tibet through the Aksai Chin area. The Indian effort to gain control of Aksai Chin led to the Sino-Indian War of 1962, which India lost. China also built the Karakoram highway jointly with Pakistan. India built the Srinagar-Leh Highway during this period, cutting the journey time between Srinagar and Leh from 16 days to two. The route, however, remains closed during the winter months due to heavy snowfall. Construction of a tunnel across Zoji La pass is under consideration to make the route functional throughout the year.

The Kargil War of 1999, codenamed &quot;Operation Vijay&quot; by the Indian Army, saw infiltration by Pakistani troops into parts of Western Ladakh, namely Kargil, Dras, Mushkoh, Batalik and Chorbatla, overlooking key locations on the Srinagar-Leh highway. Extensive operations were launched in high altitudes by the Indian Army with considerable artillery and air force support. Pakistani troops were evicted from the Indian side of the Line of Control which the Indian government ordered was to be respected and which was not crossed by Indian troops. The Indian government was criticised by the Indian public because India respected geographical co-ordinates more than India&#x27;s opponents: Pakistan and China.

The Ladakh region was divided into the Kargil and Leh districts in 1979. In 1989, there were violent riots between Buddhists and Muslims. Following demands for autonomy from the Kashmiri-dominated state government, the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council was created in the 1990s. Leh and Kargil districts now each have their own locally elected Hill Councils with some control over local policy and development funds. In 1991, a Peace Pagoda was erected in Leh by Nipponzan Myohoji.

There was a heavy presence of Indian Army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police forces in Ladakh. These forces and People&#x27;s Liberation Army forces from China have, since the 1962 Sino-Indian War, had frequent stand-offs along the Ladakh portion of the Line of Actual Control. Out of the border in Ladakh, only is the International Border, and the remaining is the Line of Actual Control. The stand-off involving the most troops was in September 2014 in the disputed Chumar region when 800 to 1,000 Indian troops and 1,500 Chinese troops came into close proximity to each other.

==== Ladakh Division ====
On 8 February 2019, Ladakh became a separate Revenue and Administrative Division within Jammu and Kashmir, having previously been part of the Kashmir Division. As a division, Ladakh was granted its own Divisional Commissioner and Inspector General of Police.

Leh was initially chosen to be the headquarters of the new division however, following protests, it was announced that Leh and Kargil will jointly serve as the divisional headquarters, each hosting an Additional Divisional Commissioner to assist the Divisional Commissioner and Inspector General of Police who will spend half their time in each town.

=== Union territory of Ladakh ===


The people of Ladakh had been demanding Ladakh to be constituted as a separate territory since 1930s, because of perceived unfair treatment by Kashmir and Ladakh&#x27;s cultural differences with predominantly Muslim Kashmir valley, while some people in Kargil opposed union territory status for Ladakh. The first organised agitation was launched against Kashmir&#x27;s &quot;dominance&quot; in the year 1964. In late 1980s, a much larger mass agitation was launched to press their demand for union territory status.

In August 2019, a reorganisation act was passed by the Parliament of India which contained provisions to reconstitute Ladakh as a union territory, separate from the rest of Jammu and Kashmir on 31 October 2019. Under the terms of the act, the union territory is administered by a Lieutenant Governor acting on behalf of the Central Government of India and does not have an elected legislative assembly or chief minister. Each district within the union territory continues to elect an autonomous district council as done previously.

The demand for Ladakh as separate union territory was first raised by the parliamentarian Kushok Bakula Rinpoche around 1955, which was later carried forward by another parliamentarian Thupstan Chhewang. The former Jammu and Kashmir state use to obtain large allocation of annual funds from the union government based on the fact that the large geographical area of the Ladakh (comprising 65% of total area), but Ladakh was allocated only 2% of the state budget based on its relative population. Within the first year of the formation of Ladakh as separate union territory, its annual budget allocation has increased 4 times from 57 crore to 232 crore.

== Geography ==


Ladakh is the highest plateau in India with most of it being over . It extends from the Himalayan to the Kunlun Ranges and includes the upper Indus River valley.

Historically, the region included the Baltistan (Baltiyul) valleys (now mostly in Pakistani-administered Kashmir), the entire upper Indus Valley, the remote Zanskar, Lahaul and Spiti districts to the south, much of Ngari (including the Rudok region and Guge in the east), Aksai Chin in the northeast, and the Nubra Valley to the north, over Khardong La in the Ladakh Range. Contemporary Ladakh borders Tibet to the east, the Lahaul and Spiti regions to the south, the Vale of Kashmir, Jammu and Baltiyul regions to the west, and the southwest corner of Xinjiang, China across the Karakoram Pass in the far north. The historically vague divide between Ladakh and the Tibetan Plateau commences to the north in an intricate maze of ridges to the east of Rudok, including Aling Kangri and Mavang Kangri, continuing southeastward toward northwestern Nepal. Before partition, Baltistan, now part of Pakistan, had been a district of Ladakh; Skardu was the winter capital of Ladakh, with Leh being the summer capital.

The mountain ranges in this region were formed over 45 million years by the folding of the Indian Plate into the more stationary Eurasian Plate. The drift continues, causing frequent earthquakes in the Himalayan region. The peaks in the Ladakh Range are at a medium altitude close to the Zoji-la () and increase toward southeast, culminating in the twin summits of Nun-Kun ().

The Suru and Zanskar Valleys form a great trough, enclosed by the Himalayas and the Zanskar Range. Rangdum is the highest inhabited region in the Suru valley, after which the valley rises to at Pensi-la, the gateway to Zanskar. Kargil, the only town in the Suru Valley, is the second-most important town in Ladakh. It was an important staging post on the routes of trade caravans prior to 1947, being more-or-less equidistant (at about 230 kilometres) from Srinagar, Leh, Skardu and Padum. The Zanskar Valley lies in the troughs of the rivers Stod and Lungnak. The region experiences heavy snowfall; the Pensi-la is open only between June and mid-October. Dras and the Mushkoh Valley form the western extremity of Ladakh.

The Indus River is the backbone of Ladakh. Most major historical and current towns – Shey, Leh, Basgo and Tingmosgang (but not Kargil), are close to the Indus River. After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, the stretch of the Indus flowing through Ladakh became the only part of this river, which is greatly venerated in the Hindu religion and culture, that still flows through India.

The Siachen Glacier is in the eastern Karakoram Range in the Himalaya Mountains along the disputed India-Pakistan border. The Karakoram Range forms a great watershed that separates China from the Indian subcontinent and is sometimes called the &quot;Third Pole&quot;. The glacier lies between the Saltoro Ridge immediately to the west and the main Karakoram Range to the east. At long, it is the longest glacier in the Karakoram and second-longest in the world&#x27;s non-polar areas. It falls from an altitude of above sea level at its source at Indira Col on the China border down to at its snout. Saser Kangri is the highest peak in the Saser Muztagh, the easternmost subrange of the Karakoram Range in India, Saser Kangri I having an altitude of .

The Ladakh Range has no major peaks; its average height is a little less than , and few of its passes are less than . The Pangong range runs parallel to the Ladakh Range for about northwest from Chushul along the southern shore of the Pangong Lake. Its highest point is about and the northern slopes are heavily glaciated. The region comprising the valley of the Shayok and Nubra rivers is known as Nubra. The Karakoram Range in Ladakh is not as mighty as in Baltistan. The massifs to the north and east of the Nubra–Siachen line include the Apsarasas Group (highest point at ) the Rimo Muztagh (highest point at ) and the Teram Kangri Group (highest point at ) together with Mamostong Kangri () and Singhi Kangri (). North of the Karakoram lies the Kunlun. Thus, between Leh and eastern Central Asia there is a triple barrier – the Ladakh Range, Karakoram Range, and Kunlun. Nevertheless, a major trade route was established between Leh and Yarkand.

Ladakh is a high-altitude desert; the Himalayas create a rain shadow which generally denies passage of any monsoon clouds. The main source of water is the winter snowfall on the mountains. Recent flooding in the region (e.g., the 2010 floods) has been attributed to abnormal rain patterns and retreating glaciers, both of which have been found to be linked to global climate change. The Leh Nutrition Project, headed by Chewang Norphel—also known as the &quot;Glacier Man&quot;—creates artificial glaciers as one solution for retreating glaciers.

The regions on the north flank of the Himalayas – Dras, the Suru valley and Zangskar – experience heavy snowfall and remain cut-off from the rest of the region for several months during the year, just as the entire region remains isolated by road from the rest of the country. Summers are short, though they are long enough to grow crops; summer weather is dry and pleasant. Peak temperatures range from in the summer and minimums range from in winter.

The Zanskar (along with its tributaries) is the primary waterway of the region. The Zanskar freezes solid during the winter, and the famous Chadar trek takes place on the magnificent frozen river.

=== Flora and fauna ===
Vegetation is extremely sparse in Ladakh except along streambeds and wetlands, on high slopes, and irrigated places. About 1250 plant species, including crops, were reported from Ladakh. The plant &quot;Ladakiella klimesii&quot;, growing up to above sea level, was first described here and named after this region. The first European to study the wildlife of this region was William Moorcroft in 1820, followed by Ferdinand Stoliczka, an Austrian-Czech palaeontologist, who carried out a massive expedition there in the 1870s. There are many lakes in Ladakh such as Kyago Tso.

The bharal (or blue sheep) is the most abundant mountain ungulate in the Ladakh region, although it is not found in some parts of Zangskar and Sham areas. The bharal is one of the preferred choices of prey of the rare snow leopard. The Asiatic ibex is a mountain goat that is distributed in the western part of Ladakh. It is the second-most abundant mountain ungulate in the region, with a population of about 6,000 individuals. It is adapted to rugged areas where it easily climbs near-vertical rock faces when threatened. The Ladakhi urial is another unique mountain sheep that inhabits the mountains of Ladakh. The population is declining, however, and there are not more than 3,000 individuals left in Ladakh. The urial is endemic to Ladakh, where it is distributed only along two major river valleys, namely the Indus and Shayok. The animal is often persecuted by farmers, whose crops are allegedly damaged by flocks of urial. Its population declined dramatically in the late twentieth century, due to indiscriminate shooting by hunters along the Leh-Srinagar Highway.

The Tibetan argali (or &quot;nyan&quot;) is the largest wild sheep species in the world, standing at the shoulder, possessing very large, curled horns measuring . It is distributed on the Tibetan Plateau and its marginal ranges, encompassing a total home range of ; however, there is only a small population, of about 400 animals, in Ladakh. Unlike other mountain sheep and goat species, the argali prefers open, grassy fields and rolling hills as it prefers to run, rather than climb into steep terrain, to flee from danger. The endangered Tibetan antelope, or &quot;chiru&quot; in Indian English (or Ladakhi &quot;tsos&quot;), has traditionally been hunted for its wool (&quot;shahtoosh&quot;), a natural fibre of some of the finest quality. The wool of the Tibetan antelope is prized for its lightweight feel and as a status symbol. The wool must be pulled out by hand, a process done after the animal is killed. The fibre is smuggled into Kashmir and woven into exquisite shawls by Kashmiri workers. Ladakh is also home to the Tibetan gazelle, which inhabits the vast rangelands in eastern Ladakh bordering Tibet.
The kiang, or Tibetan wild ass, is common in the grasslands of Changthang, numbering about 2,500 individuals. These animals are in conflict with the nomadic people of Changthang who hold the Kiang responsible for pasture degradation. There are about 200 snow leopards in Ladakh of an estimated 7,000 worldwide. The Hemis High Altitude National Park in central Ladakh is an especially good habitat for this predator as it has abundant prey populations. The Eurasian lynx, is another rare cat that preys on smaller herbivores in Ladakh. It is mostly found in Nubra, Changthang and Zangskar. The Pallas&#x27;s cat, which looks somewhat like a house cat, is very rare in Ladakh and not much is known about the species. The Tibetan wolf, which sometimes preys on the livestock of the Ladakhis, is the most persecuted among the predators. There are also a few brown bears in the Suru Valley and the area around Dras. The Tibetan sand fox has been discovered in this region. Among smaller animals, marmots, hares, and several types of pika and vole are common.

==== Flora ====
Scant precipitation makes Ladakh a high-altitude desert with extremely scarce vegetation over most of its area. Natural vegetation mainly occurs along water courses and on high altitude areas that receive more snow and cooler summer temperatures. Human settlements, however, are richly vegetated due to irrigation.
Natural vegetation commonly seen along watercourses includes seabuckthorn (&quot;Hippophae&quot; spp.), wild roses of pink or yellow varieties, tamarisk (&quot;Myricaria&quot; spp.), caraway, stinging nettles, mint, &quot;Physochlaina praealta&quot;, and various grasses.

== Administration ==
Under the terms of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, Ladakh is administered as a union territory without a legislative assembly or elected government. The head of government is a Lieutenant Governor appointed by the President of India who is assisted by civil servants of the Indian Administrative Service.

=== Districts ===


==== Autonomous District Councils ====
Ladakh is administered by 2 autonomous district councils, they are:

*Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, Kargil
*Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, Leh

The two autonomous district councils work with village panchayats to take decisions on economic development, healthcare, education, land use, taxation, and local governance which are further reviewed at the block headquarters in the presence of the chief executive councillor and executive councillors. The government of Jammu and Kashmir looks after law and order, the judicial system, communications and the higher education in the region.

The two autonomous district councils continue to exist following the formation of the union territory of Ladakh on 31 October 2019.

Government of India announced the formation of 5 new districts, namely Zanskar, Drass, Sham, Nubra, and Changthang in Ladakh to ease administration and increase representation by the year 2028. With this move, the total number of districts in Ladakh will increase from two to seven.

=== Law enforcement and justice ===
Ladakh is under the jurisdiction of the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The union territory of Ladakh has its own police force headed by a director general of police.

=== Ladakh in the Parliament of India ===
Ladakh sends one member (MP) to the lower house of the Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha. The MP for the Ladakh constituency in the current Lok Sabha is Mohmad Haneefa, who was elected as an independent candidate.
== Economy ==
The land is irrigated by a system of channels which funnel water from the ice and snow of the mountains. The principal crops are barley and wheat. Rice was previously a luxury in the Ladakhi diet, but, subsidised by the government, has now become a cheap staple.

Naked barley (Ladakhi: &quot;nas&quot;, Urdu: &quot;grim&quot;) was traditionally a staple crop all over Ladakh. Growing times vary considerably with altitude. The extreme limit of cultivation is at Korzok, on the Tso-moriri lake, at , which has what are widely considered to be the highest fields in the world.

A minority of Ladakhi people were also employed as merchants and caravan traders, facilitating trade in textiles, carpets, dyestuffs and narcotics between Punjab and Xinjiang. However, since the Chinese Government closed the borders between Tibet Autonomous Region and Ladakh, this international trade has completely dried up.

Indus river flowing in the Ladakh region is endowed with vast hydropower potential. Solar and wind power potentials are also substantial. Though the region is a remote hilly area without all-weather roads, the area is also rich in limestone deposits to manufacture cement from the locally available cheap electricity for various construction needs.

Since 1974, the Indian Government has encouraged a shift in trekking and other tourist activities from the troubled Kashmir region to the relatively unaffected areas of Ladakh. Although tourism employs only 4% of Ladakh&#x27;s working population, it now accounts for 50% of the region&#x27;s GNP.

This era is recorded in Arthur Neves &quot;The Tourist&#x27;s Guide to Kashmir, Ladakh, and Skardo&quot;, first published in 1911.

== Transportation ==

There are about of roads in Ladakh of which are surfaced. The majority of roads in Ladakh are looked after by the Border Roads Organisation. There are two main roads that connect Ladakh with the rest of the country, NH1 connecting Srinagar to Kargil and Leh, and NH3 connecting Manali to Leh. A third road to Ladakh is the Nimmu–Padam–Darcha road, which is under construction.

There is an airport in Leh, Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport, from which there are daily flights to Delhi and weekly flights to Srinagar and Jammu. There are two airstrips at Daulat Beg Oldie and Fukche for military transport. The airport at Kargil, Kargil Airport, was intended for civilian flights but is currently used by the Indian Army. The airport is a political issue for the locals who argue that the airport should serve its original purpose, i.e., should open up for civilian flights. Since past few years the Indian Air Force has been operating AN-32 air courier service to transport the locals during the winter seasons to Jammu, Srinagar and Chandigarh. A private aeroplane company Air Mantra landed a 17-seater aircraft at the airport, in presence of dignitaries like the Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, marking the first ever landing by a civilian airline company at Kargil Airport.

== Demographics ==
The sex ratio for Leh district declined from 1011 females per 1000 males in 1951 to 805 in 2001, while for Kargil district it declined from 970 to 901. The urban sex ratio in both the districts is about 640. The adult sex ratio reflects large numbers of mostly male seasonal and migrant labourers and merchants. About 84% of Ladakh&#x27;s population lives in villages. The average annual population growth rate from 1981 to 2001 was 2.75% in Leh District and 2.83% in Kargil district.

===Religion===
The Dras and Dha-Hanu regions are habitated by Brokpa, Drokpa, Dard and Shinu tribes and Shina people respectively, who are predominately followers of Islam while small minorities follow Tibetan Buddhism and Hinduism. The region&#x27;s population is split roughly in half between the districts of Leh and Kargil. 76.87% population of Kargil is Muslim (mostly Shia), with a total population of 140,802, while that of Leh is 66.40% Buddhist, with a total population of 133,487, as per the 2011 census. In 2024, 5 new districts were created. Currently Buddhism is the majority faith in five of the districts-Leh, Changthang, Zanskar, Sham and Nubra; and Islam is the majority faith in Kargil and Drass district. Majority Ladakhis, Changpa and Brokpa follow Buddhism.

===Languages===

The predominant mother-tongue in Leh district is Ladakhi (also called Bauti), a Tibetic language. Purgi, sometimes considered a dialect of Balti, is the predominant mother-tongue of Kargil district. Within Ladakh, there is a range of dialects, so that the language of the Chang-pa people may differ markedly from that of the Purig-pa in Kargil, or the Zangskaris, but they are all mutually comprehensible. Most Ladakhi people (especially the younger generations) speak fluently in English and in Hindi too, due to the languages education at school. Administrative work and education are carried out in English.

== Culture ==

Ladakhi culture is similar to Tibetan culture.

=== Cuisine ===

Ladakhi food has much in common with Tibetan food, the most prominent foods being &quot;thukpa&quot; (noodle soup) and &quot;tsampa&quot;, known in Ladakhi as &quot;ngampe&quot; (roasted barley flour). Edible without cooking, &quot;tsampa&quot; makes useful trekking food. Strictly Ladakhi dishes include &quot;skyu&quot; and &quot;chutagi&quot;, both heavy and rich soup pasta dishes, &quot;skyu&quot; being made with root vegetables and meat, and &quot;chutagi&quot; with leafy greens and vegetables. As Ladakh moves toward a cash-based economy, foods from the plains of India are becoming more common. As in other parts of Central Asia, tea in Ladakh is traditionally made with strong green tea, butter, and salt. It is mixed in a large churn and known as &quot;gurgur cha&quot;, after the sound it makes when mixed. Sweet tea (&quot;cha ngarmo&quot;) is common now, made in the Indian style with milk and sugar. Most of the surplus barley that is produced is fermented into &quot;chang&quot;, an alcoholic beverage drunk especially on festive occasions.

=== Music and dance ===

The music of Ladakhi Buddhist monastic festivals, like Tibetan music, often involves religious chanting in Tibetan as an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of sacred texts or in celebration of various festivals. &quot;Yang&quot; chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables. Religious mask dances are an important part of Ladakh&#x27;s cultural life. Hemis monastery, a leading centre of the Drukpa tradition of Buddhism, holds an annual masked dance festival, as do all major Ladakhi monasteries. The dances typically narrate a story of the fight between good and evil, ending with the eventual victory of the former. Weaving is an important part of traditional life in eastern Ladakh. Both women and men weave, on different looms.

=== Sport ===

The most popular sport in Ladakh is ice hockey, which is played only on natural ice generally mid-December through mid-February. Cricket is also very popular.

Archery is a traditional sport in Ladakh, and many villages hold archery festivals, which are as much about traditional dancing, drinking and gambling, as they are about the sport. The sport is conducted with strict etiquette, to the accompaniment of the music of &quot;surna&quot; and &quot;daman&quot; (shehnai and drum). Polo, the other traditional sport of Ladakh, is indigenous to Baltistan and Gilgit, and was probably introduced into Ladakh in the mid-17th century by King Singge Namgyal, whose mother was a Balti princess.

Polo, popular among the Baltis, is an annual affair in the Dras region of Kargil district.

The Ladakh Marathon is a high-altitude marathon held in Leh every year since 2012. Held at a height of , it is one of the world&#x27;s highest marathons.

=== Social status of women ===

A feature of Ladakhi society that distinguishes it from the rest of the state is the high status and relative emancipation enjoyed by women compared to other rural parts of India. Fraternal polyandry and inheritance by primogeniture were common in Ladakh until the early 1940s when these were made illegal by the government of Jammu and Kashmir. However, the practice remained in existence into the 1990s especially among the elderly and the more isolated rural populations. Another custom is known as &quot;khang-bu&quot;, or &#x27;little house&#x27;, in which the elders of a family, as soon as the eldest son has sufficiently matured, retire from participation in affairs, yielding the headship of the family to him and taking only enough of the property for their own sustenance. 

=== Traditional medicine ===

Tibetan medicine has been the traditional health system of Ladakh for over a thousand years. This school of traditional healing contains elements of Ayurveda and Chinese medicine, combined with the philosophy and cosmology of Tibetan Buddhism. For centuries, the only medical system accessible to the people have been the &quot;amchi&quot;, traditional doctors following the Tibetan medical tradition. &quot;Amchi&quot; medicine remains a component of public health, especially in remote areas.

Programmes by the government, local and international organisations are working to develop and rejuvenate this traditional system of healing. Efforts are underway to preserve the intellectual property rights of &quot;amchi&quot; medicine for the people of Ladakh. The government has also been trying to promote the sea buckthorn in the form of juice and jam, as some claim it possess medicinal properties.

The National Research Institute for Sowa-Rigpa in Leh is an institute for research into traditional medicine and a hospital providing traditional treatments.

== Education ==
According to the 2001 census, the overall literacy rate in Leh District is 62% (72% for males and 50% for females), and in Kargil District 58% (74% for males and 41% for females). Traditionally there was little or nothing by way of formal education except in the monasteries. Usually, one son from every family was obliged to master the Tibetan script in order to read the holy books.

The Moravian Mission opened a school in Leh in October 1889, and the &quot;Wazir-i Wazarat&quot; (&quot;ex officio&quot; Joint Commissioner with a British officer) of Baltistan and Ladakh ordered that every family with more than one child should send one of them to school. This order met with great resistance from the local people who feared that the children would be forced to convert to Christianity. The school taught Tibetan, Urdu, English, Geography, Sciences, Nature study, Arithmetic, Geometry and Bible study. It is still in existence today. The first local school to provide western education was opened by a local Society called &quot;Lamdon Social Welfare Society&quot; in 1973. Later, with support from Dalai Lama and some international organisations, the school, now known as Lamdon Model Senior Secondary School, has grown to accommodate approximately two thousand pupils in several branches. It prides itself on preserving Ladakhi tradition and culture.

Schools are well distributed throughout Ladakh but 75% of them provide only primary education. 65% of children attend school, but absenteeism of both students and teachers remains high. In both districts the failure rate at school-leaving level (class X) had for many years been around 85%–95%, while of those managing to scrape through, barely half succeeded in qualifying for college entrance (class XII). Before 1993, students were taught in Urdu until they were 14, after which the medium of instruction shifted to English.

As of January 2022, there were 904 Government run schools in Ladakh and 113 publicly run private schools in Ladakh.

In 1994 the Students&#x27; Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) launched Operation New Hope (ONH), a campaign to provide &quot;culturally appropriate and locally relevant education&quot; and make government schools more functional and effective. Central Institute of Buddhist Studies a Deemed University in Leh is the oldest institution in this reason which mainly focuses on Buddhist philosophy but also offer degrees in different fields.
The University of Ladakh with its two campuses (One each in Kargil &amp; Leh) and its constituent colleges enables students to pursue higher education without having to leave Ladakh. A central University has also been approved to be set up in Ladakh by the Union Cabinet. The Indian Astronomical Observatory is located in Hanle and is operated by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics.

In December 2019, the union minister of state for home affairs Mr G Kishan Reddy, in a written response has stated in Parliament that the Government of India has approved to establish a Medical College and National Research Institute for Sowa-Rigpa in the district of Leh.

In August 2021, the Parliament of India amended the Central Universities Act to establish a central university in Ladakh named &quot;Sindhu Central University&quot;.

== Media ==
The government radio broadcaster All India Radio (AIR) and government television station Doordarshan have stations in Leh that broadcast local content for a few hours a day. Beyond that, Ladakhis produce feature films that are screened in auditoriums and community halls. They are often made on fairly modest budgets. On 14 December 2021, the first FM radio station in Ladakh was established in Leh.

There are a handful of private news outlets.

*&quot;Reach Ladakh Bulletin&quot;, a biweekly newspaper in English, is the only print media published by and for Ladakhis.
*&quot;Rangyul&quot; or &quot;Kargil Number&quot; is a newspaper published from Kashmir covering Ladakh in English and Urdu.
*&quot;Ladags Melong&quot;, an initiative of SECMOL, was published from 1992 to 2005 in English and Ladakhi.
*&quot;Sintic Magazine&quot;, a lifestyle and tourist magazine of Ladakh, was started in 2018 in English.

Some publications that cover Jammu and Kashmir as a whole provide some coverage of Ladakh.

<text>Homo rudolfensis is an extinct species of archaic human from the Early Pleistocene of East Africa about 2 million years ago (mya). Because &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; coexisted with several other hominins, it is debated what specimens can be confidently assigned to this species beyond the lectotype skull KNM-ER 1470 and other partial skull aspects. No bodily remains are definitively assigned to &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;. Consequently, both its generic classification and validity are debated without any wide consensus, with some recommending the species to actually belong to the genus &quot;Australopithecus&quot; as A. rudolfensis or &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; as K. rudolfensis, or that it is synonymous with the contemporaneous and anatomically similar &quot;H. habilis&quot;.

&quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; is distinguished from &quot;H. habilis&quot; by larger size, but it is also argued that this species actually consists of male &quot;H. habilis&quot; specimens, assuming that &quot;H. habilis&quot; was sexually dimorphic and males were much larger than females. Because no bodily remains are definitely identified, body size estimates are largely based on the stature of &quot;H. habilis&quot;. Using this, male &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; may have averaged about in height and in weight, and females and . KNM-ER 1470 had a brain volume of about . Like other early &quot;Homo&quot;, &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; had large cheek teeth and thick enamel.

Early &quot;Homo&quot; species exhibit marked brain growth compared to &quot;Australopithecus&quot; predecessors, which is typically explained as a change in diet with a calorie-rich food source, namely meat. Though not associated with tools, dental anatomy suggests some processing of plant or meat fiber before consumption, though the mouth could still effectively chew through mechanically challenging food, indicating tool use did not greatly affect diet.

==Research history==

The first fossils were discovered in 1972 along Lake Turkana (at the time called Lake Rudolf) in Kenya, and were detailed by Kenyan palaeoanthropologist Richard Leakey the following year. The specimens were: a large and nearly complete skull (KNM-ER 1470, the lectotype) discovered by Bernard Ngeneo, a local; a right femur (KNM-ER 1472) discovered by J. Harris; an upper femur (proximal) fragment (KNM-ER 1475) discovered by fossil collector Kamoya Kimeu; and a complete left femur (KNM-ER 1481) discovered by Harris. However, it is unclear if the femora belong to the same species as the skull. Leakey classified them under the genus &quot;Homo&quot; because he had reconstructed the skull fragments so that it had a large brain volume and a flat face, but did not assign them to a species. Because the horizon they were discovered in was, at the time, dated to 2.9–2.6 million years ago (mya), Leakey thought these specimens were a very early human ancestor. This challenged the major model of human evolution at the time where &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot; gave rise to &quot;Homo&quot; about 2.5 mya, but if &quot;Homo&quot; had already existed at this time, it would call for serious revisions. However, the area was redated to about 2 mya in 1977 (the same time period as &quot;H. habilis&quot; and &quot;H. ergaster&quot;/&quot;H. erectus&quot;), and more precisely to 2.1–1.95 mya in 2012. They were first assigned to the species &quot;habilis&quot; in 1975 by anthropologists Colin Groves and Vratislav Mazák. In 1978, in a joint paper with Leakey and English anthropologist Alan Walker, Walker suggested the remains belong in &quot;Australopithecus&quot; (and that the skull was incorrectly reconstructed), but Leakey still believed they belonged to &quot;Homo&quot;, though they both agreed that the remains could belong to &quot;habilis&quot;.

KNM-ER 1470 was much larger than the Olduvai remains, so the terms &quot;H. habilis sensu lato&quot; (&quot;in the broad sense&quot;) and &quot;H. habilis sensu stricto&quot; (&quot;in the strict sense&quot;) were used to include or exclude the larger morph, respectively. In 1986, English palaeoanthropologist Bernard Wood first suggested these remains represent a different &quot;Homo&quot; species, which coexisted with &quot;H. habilis&quot; and &quot;H. ergaster&quot;/&quot;H. erectus&quot;. Coexisting &quot;Homo&quot; species conflicted with the predominant model of human evolution at the time which was that modern humans evolved in a straight line directly from &quot;H. ergaster&quot;/&quot;H. erectus&quot; which evolved directly from &quot;H. habilis&quot;. In 1986, the remains were placed into a new species, &quot;rudolfensis&quot;, by Russian anthropologist Valery Alekseyev (but he used the genus &quot;Pithecanthropus&quot;, which was changed to &quot;Homo&quot; three years later by Groves). In 1999, Kennedy argued that the name was invalid because Alekseyev had not assigned a holotype. Pointing out that this is in fact not mandatory, Wood the same year nevertheless designated KNM-ER 1470 as the lectotype. However, the validity of this species has also been debated on material grounds, with some arguing that &quot;H. habilis&quot; was highly sexually dimorphic like modern non-human apes, with the larger skulls classified as &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; actually representing male &quot;H. habilis&quot;. In 1999, Wood and biological anthropologist Mark Collard recommended moving &quot;rudolfensis&quot; and &quot;habilis&quot; to &quot;Australopithecus&quot; based on the similarity of dental adaptations. However, they conceded that dental anatomy is highly variable among hominins and not always reliable when formulating family trees.
In 2003, Australian anthropologist David Cameron concluded that the earlier australopithecine &quot;Kenyanthropus platyops&quot; was the ancestor of &quot;rudolfensis&quot;, and reclassified it as &quot;K. rudolfensis&quot;. He also believed that &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; was more closely related to &quot;Paranthropus&quot; than &quot;Homo&quot;. In 2008, a re-reconstruction of the skull concluded it was incorrectly restored originally, though agreed with the classification as &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;. In 2012, British palaeoanthropologist Meave Leakey described the juvenile partial face KNM-ER 62000 discovered in Koobi Fora, Kenya; noting it shares several similarities to KNM-ER 1470 and is smaller, she assigned it to &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;, and, because prepubescent male and female bones should be indistinguishable, differences between juvenile &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; and adult &quot;H. habilis&quot; specimens support species distinction. She also concluded that the jawbone KNM-ER 1802, an important specimen often used in classifying other specimens as &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;, actually belongs to a different (possibly undescribed) species, but American palaeoanthropologist Tim D. White believes this to be premature because it is unclear how wide the range of variation is in early hominins. The 2013 discovery of the 1.8 Ma Georgian Dmanisi skulls which exhibit several similarities with early &quot;Homo&quot; have led to suggestions that all contemporary groups of early &quot;Homo&quot; in Africa, including &quot;H. habilis&quot; and &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;, are the same species and should be assigned to &quot;H. erectus&quot;. There is still no wide consensus on how &quot;rudolfensis&quot; and &quot;habilis&quot; relate to &quot;H. ergaster&quot; and descendent species.

Beyond KNM-ER 1470, there is disagreement on which specimens actually belong in &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; as it is difficult to assign with accuracy remains that do not preserve the face and jaw. No &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; bodily elements have been definitively associated with a skull and thus to the species. Most proposed &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; fossils come from Koobi Fora and date to 1.9–1.85 mya. Remains from the Shungura Formation, Ethiopia, and Uraha, Malawi, are dated as far back as 2.5–2.4 mya, which would make it the earliest identified species of &quot;Homo&quot;. The latest potential specimen is KNM-ER 819 dating to 1.65–1.55 mya.

Nonetheless, &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; and &quot;H. habilis&quot; generally are recognised members of the genus at the base of the family tree, with arguments for synonymisation or removal from the genus not widely adopted. Though it is now largely agreed upon that &quot;Homo&quot; evolved from &quot;Australopithecus&quot;, the timing and placement of this split has been much debated, with many &quot;Australopithecus&quot; species having been proposed as the ancestor. The discovery of LD 350-1, the oldest &quot;Homo&quot; specimen, dating to 2.8 mya, in the Afar Region of Ethiopia may indicate that the genus evolved from &quot;A. afarensis&quot; around this time. The species LD 350-1 belongs to could be the ancestor of &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; and &quot;H. habilis&quot;, but this is unclear. Based on 2.1 million year old stone tools from Shangchen, China, possibly an ancestral species to &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; and &quot;H. habilis&quot; dispersed across Asia.

==Anatomy==

===Skull===

In 1973, Richard Leakey had reconstructed the skull KNM-ER 1470 with a flat face and a brain volume of . In 1983, American physical anthropologist Ralph Holloway revised the base of the skull and calculated a brain volume of . For comparison, &quot;H. habilis&quot; specimens average about , and &quot;H. ergaster&quot; . Anthropologist Timothy Bromage and colleagues revised the face again at a 5° incline (slightly prognathic) instead of completely flat, but pushed the nasal bone back directly beneath the frontal bones. He then said it was possible to predict brain size based on just the face and (disregarding the braincase) calculated , and chalked up the errors of Leakey&#x27;s reconstruction to a lack of research of the biological principles of facial anatomy at the time as well as confirmation bias, as a flat-faced reconstruction of the skull aligned with the predominant model of human evolution at the time. This was refuted by American palaeoanthropologist John D. Hawks because the skull remained more or less unchanged except for the 5° rotation outwards. Bromage and colleagues returned in 2008 with a revised skull reconstruction and brain volume estimate of .
Fossils have generally been classified into &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; due to large skull size, flatter and broader face, broader cheek teeth, more complex tooth crowns and roots, and thicker enamel compared to &quot;H. habilis&quot;. Early &quot;Homo&quot; are characterised by larger teeth compared to later &quot;Homo&quot;. The cheek teeth of KNM-ER 60000, a jawbone, in terms of size are on the lower end for early &quot;Homo&quot;, except for the third molar which is within range. The molars increase in size towards the back of the mouth. The tooth rows of KNM-ER 1470, KNM-ER 60000, and KNM-ER 62000 are rectangular, whereas the tooth row of KNM-ER 1802 is U-shaped, which may indicate that these two morphs represent different species, or demonstrate the normal range of variation for &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; jaws. In UR 501 from Uraha, Malawi—the oldest &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; specimen dating to 2.5–2.3 mya—the tooth enamel thickness is the same as in other early &quot;Homo&quot;, but the enamel on the molars is almost as thick as &quot;Paranthropus&quot; molars (which have some of the thickest enamel of any hominin). Such a wide variation in enamel thickness across the cheek teeth is not exhibited in KNM-ER 1802, which may indicate regional differences among &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; populations.

===Build===
Body size estimates of &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; and &quot;H. habilis&quot; typically conclude a small size comparable to australopithecines. These largely depend on the &quot;H. habilis&quot; partial skeleton OH 62 estimated at in height and in weight. &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; is thought to be bigger than &quot;H. habilis&quot;, but it is unclear how big this species was as no bodily elements have been definitively associated with a skull. Based on just the KNM-ER 1470 skull, male &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; were estimated to have been in height and in weight, and females and .

For specimens that might be &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;: the femur KNM-ER 1472 which may also be &quot;H. habilis&quot; or &quot;H. ergaster&quot; was estimated at and , the humerus KNM-ER 1473 and , the partial leg KNM-ER 1481 which may also be &quot;H. ergaster&quot; and , the pelvis KNM-ER 3228 which may also be &quot;H. ergaster&quot; and , and the femur KNM-ER 3728 which may be &quot;H. habilis&quot; or &quot;P. boisei&quot; and . It is generally assumed that pre-&quot;H. ergaster&quot; hominins, including &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; and &quot;H. habilis&quot;, exhibited sexual dimorphism with males markedly bigger than females. However, relative female body mass is unknown in either species.

Early hominins, including &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;, are thought to have had thick body hair coverage like modern non-human apes because they appear to have inhabited cooler regions and are thought to have had a less active lifestyle than (presumed hairless) post-&quot;ergaster&quot; species, and so probably required thick body hair to stay warm. The juvenile specimen KNM-ER 62000, a partial face, has the same age landmarks as a 13 to 14 year old modern human, but more likely died at around 8 years of age due to the presumed faster growth rate among early hominins based on dental development rate.

==Culture==

It is typically thought that the diets of early &quot;Homo&quot; had a greater proportion of meat than &quot;Australopithecus&quot;, and that this led to brain growth. The main hypotheses regarding this are: meat is energy- and nutrient-rich and put evolutionary pressure on developing enhanced cognitive skills to facilitate strategic scavenging and monopolise fresh carcasses, or meat allowed the large and calorie-expensive ape gut to decrease in size allowing this energy to be diverted to brain growth. Alternatively, it is also suggested that early &quot;Homo&quot;, in a drying climate with scarcer food options, relied primarily on underground storage organs (such as tubers) and food sharing, which facilitated social bonding among both male and female group members. However, unlike what is presumed for &quot;H. ergaster&quot; and later &quot;Homo&quot;, short-statured early &quot;Homo&quot; were likely incapable of endurance running and hunting, and the long and &quot;Australopithecus&quot;-like forearm of &quot;H. habilis&quot; could indicate early &quot;Homo&quot; were still arboreal to a degree. Also, organised hunting and gathering is thought to have emerged in &quot;H. ergaster&quot;. Nonetheless, the proposed food-gathering models to explain large brain growth necessitate increased daily travel distance. Large incisor size in &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; and &quot;H. habilis&quot; compared to &quot;Australopithecus&quot; predecessors implies these two species relied on incisors more. The large, &quot;Australopithecus&quot;-like molars could indicate more mechanically challenging food compared to later &quot;Homo&quot;. The bodies of the mandibles of &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; and other early &quot;Homo&quot; are thicker than those of modern humans and all living apes, more comparable to &quot;Australopithecus&quot;. The mandibular body resists torsion from the bite force or chewing, meaning their jaws could produce unusually powerful stresses while eating.

&quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; is not associated with any tools. However, the greater molar cusp relief in &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; and &quot;H. habilis&quot; compared to &quot;Australopithecus&quot; suggests the former two used tools to fracture tough foods (such as pliable plant parts or meat), otherwise the cusps would have been more worn down. Nonetheless, the jaw adaptations for processing mechanically challenging food indicates technological advancement did not greatly affect their diet. Large concentrations of stone tools are known from Koobi Fora. Because these aggregations are coincident with the emergence of &quot;H. ergaster&quot;, it is probable &quot;H. ergaster&quot; manufactured them, though it is not possible to definitively attribute the tools to a species because &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;, &quot;H. habilis&quot;, and &quot;P. boisei&quot; are also well known from the area. The oldest specimen of &quot;Homo&quot;, LD 350-1, is associated with the Oldowan stone tool industry, meaning this tradition had been in use by the genus since near its emergence.

Early &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; and &quot;Paranthropus&quot; have exceptionally thick molars for hominins, and the emergence of these two coincides with a cooling and aridity trend in Africa about 2.5 mya. This could mean they evolved due to climate change. Nonetheless, in East Africa, tropical forests and woodlands still persisted through periods of drought. &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; coexisted with &quot;H. habilis&quot;, &quot;H. ergaster&quot;, and &quot;P. boisei&quot;.

<text>Fernando José &quot;Corby&quot; Corbató (July 1, 1926 – July 12, 2019) was an American computer scientist, notable as a pioneer in the development of time-sharing operating systems.

==Career==
Corbató was born on July 1, 1926, in Oakland, California, to Hermenegildo Corbató, a Spanish literature professor from Villarreal, Spain, and Charlotte (Jensen) Corbató, a Danish American. In 1930, the Corbató family moved to Los Angeles for Hermenegildo&#x27;s job at the University of California, Los Angeles.

In 1943, Corbató enrolled at UCLA, but due to World War II he was recruited by the Navy during his first year. During the war, Corbató &quot;debug[ged] an incredible array of equipment&quot;, inspiring his future career.

Corbató left the Navy in 1946, enrolled at the California Institute of Technology, and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics in 1950. He then earned a PhD in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956. He joined MIT&#x27;s Computation Center immediately upon graduation, became a professor in 1965, and stayed at MIT until he retired.

The first time-sharing system he was associated with was known as the MIT Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS), an early version of which was demonstrated in 1961. Corbató is credited with the first use of passwords to secure access to files on a large computer system, though he later claimed that this rudimentary security method had proliferated and became unmanageable.

The experience with developing CTSS led to a second project, Multics, which was adopted by General Electric for its high-end computer systems (later acquired by Honeywell). Multics pioneered many concepts now used in modern operating systems, including a hierarchical file system, ring-oriented security, access control lists, single-level store, dynamic linking, and extensive on-line reconfiguration for reliable service. Multics, while not particularly commercially successful in itself, directly inspired Ken Thompson to develop Unix, the direct descendants of which are still in extremely wide use; Unix also served as a direct model for many other subsequent operating system designs.

==Awards==
Among many awards, Corbató received the Turing Award in 1990, &quot;for his pioneering work in organizing the concepts and leading the development of the general-purpose, large-scale, time-sharing and resource-sharing computer systems&quot;.

In 2012, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum &quot;for his pioneering work on timesharing and the Multics operating system&quot;.

==Legacy==
Corbató is sometimes known for &quot;Corbató&#x27;s Law&quot; which states:

Corbató is recognized as helping to create the first computer password.

==Personal life and death==
Corbató married programmer Isabel Blandford in 1962; she died in 1973.

Corbató had a second wife, Emily (née Gluck); two daughters, Carolyn Corbató Stone and Nancy Corbató, by his late wife Isabel; two step-sons, David Gish and Jason Gish; a brother, Charles; and five grandchildren.

Corbató lived on Temple Street in West Newton, Massachusetts. He died on July 12, 2019, in Newburyport, Massachusetts, at the age of 93 due to complications from diabetes.

<doc id="303628" wikidata="Q731200" url="?curid=303628" title="Sea Shepherd Conservation Society">
<text>The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society (SSCS) is a non-profit, marine conservation activism organization based in Friday Harbor on San Juan Island, Washington, in the United States. Sea Shepherd employs direct action tactics to achieve its goals, most famously by deploying its fleet of ships to track, report on and actively impede the work of fishing vessels believed to be engaged in illegal and unregulated activities causing the unsustainable exploitation of marine life.

Sea Shepherd has been criticised by some environmental groups and national governments that oppose its tactics. The Japanese government, whose whaling industry is a leading target of the organization&#x27;s efforts, has called Sea Shepherd eco-terrorists for &quot;impeding their research&quot;.

==History==
The predecessor organization of Sea Shepherd, the &quot;Earth Force Society&quot;, was formed in 1977, after its founder, Paul Watson was ousted from the board of Greenpeace for disagreements over his direct action activism which clashed with their pacifist nature. Watson soon left Greenpeace. Initially without funding and with only a small group of supporters, Watson convinced Cleveland Amory, head of the Fund for Animals, to fund Watson&#x27;s first vessel, the &quot;Sea Shepherd&quot; in 1978.

The first direct action undertaken by the organization was against Canadian seal hunting in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in March 1979. The same year, the Sea Shepherd also rammed an unregulated Portuguese whaling vessel, the notorious &quot;Sierra&quot;. After the Portugal campaign, the first &quot;Sea Shepherd&quot; had to be scuttled, but Watson sold the story to raise money to fund his next vessel. He then spent the 1980s undertaking a variety of controversial and dangerous operations in support of various marine conservation aims, and physically intervened against Russian, Spanish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Makah, Faroese, and Japanese whalers.

In the 1990s the group is described as having undertaken a shift in its public attitude. Having previously argued primarily from an ethical viewpoint, Sea Shepherd began to describe itself as an anti-poaching agency, a claim it based on its interpretation of the maritime and conservation law. The decade also saw the organization make more progress in saving wildlife, including by teaming up with other groups to reduce the prevalence of driftnet fishing. In 1994, Sea Shepherd sank an illegal Norwegian whaling vessel. However, no charges were brought as the vessel had been involved in even more illegal behavior than anticipated by the authorities.

The organization began in the 2000s by assisting with the clean up of the Petrobras oil spill, Brazil&#x27;s worst oil spill to date, after being contracted by the Rio government to mitigate against the devastation. Sea Shepherd also cooperated with other governments against maritime poaching, including in Costa Rica, though not always with good outcomes. In 2008, Sea Shepherd conducted two trips around Antarctica to disrupt illegal whaling practices.

Since 2016, Sea Shepherd has increasingly co-operated with national governments in assisting anti-poaching activity in national territorial waters and marine reserves, including with the Italian Coast Guard in Sicily (Operation Siracusa), Mexican Navy (Operation Milagro) and the Coastguards of Gabon and São Tomé and Príncipe (Operation Albacore), which saw Gabonese military marines sail aboard Sea Shepherd vessels.

In late 2022, a schism occurred after Paul Watson was removed from the board of directors of Sea Shepherd Global, a move which, he says, was due to the organization shifting away from his policy of independent, direct action to one of collaboration with governments. Watson subsequently formed his own organization, the Captain Paul Watson Foundation, and a competing Sea Shepherd group called Sea Shepherd Origins. The France, UK, and Brazil chapters of Sea Shepherd have pledged their allegiance to Paul Watson and Sea Shepherd Origins, and have left the umbrella of Sea Shepherd Global. Neither Sea Shepherd Global or the regional chapters that remain loyal to it have issued statements in regard to these events.

==Organization==

Sea Shepherd is a non-governmental, non-profit environmental organization. In the United States it has a 501(c)(3) tax exempt status. Most of the organization&#x27;s revenue is spent on its programs – 89.9 percent in 2019, with just 10.1 percent spent on administrative costs and fundraising. Sea Shepherd has also been rated highly for financial transparency and accountability. The group is supported by private and corporate donations, lectures by Watson, internet advertising and grants. It is operated by volunteers and a small paid staff, and is committed to staying small and with low spending on fundraising or recruitment.

Sea Shepherd is governed by a board of directors and several boards of advisers, each addressing an area of expertise. The Scientific, Technical and Conservation Advisory Board includes Earth First! founder Dave Foreman and Horst Klienschmidt, a former deputy chair of the International Whaling Commission (2006). The Legal and Law Enforcement Advisory Board includes Ian Campbell, a former Australian Minister of the Environment and Heritage (2004–07). The Animal Welfare, Humane and Animal Rights Advisory Board included animal rights philosopher Tom Regan, until his death in 2017. There is also a Media and Arts Advisory Board, Photography Advisory Board and a Financial and Management Advisory Board.

==Direct action activism==

Sea Shepherd engages in conventional protests and direct actions to protect marine wildlife. Sea Shepherd operations have included interdiction against commercial fishing, shark poaching and finning, seal hunting, and whaling. The group has been active in intervening against fishing and poaching in the South Pacific, the Mediterranean, and in waters around the Galapagos Islands. In addition to their direct action campaigns, Sea Shepherd works on ocean issues such as plastic pollution. Sea Shepherd chapters across the world organize onshore cleanups throughout the year to pick up debris near oceans, streams, and rivers. In April 2018, Sea Shepherd released a PSA that takes an artistic approach to telling target audiences that more than one million marine animals die every year from plastic debris.

According to its mission statement, Sea Shepherd &quot;uses innovative direct-action tactics to investigate, document, and take action when necessary to expose and confront illegal activities on the high seas&quot;. In addition to the organization&#x27;s role of documenting and reporting violations of conservation laws, Sea Shepherd operations have utilized direct, non-lethal tactics including scuttling and disabling whaling vessels at harbor, intervening in Canadian and Namibian seal hunts, shining laser light at whalers, throwing bottles of foul-smelling butyric acid onto vessels at sea, boarding whaling vessels to protest while at sea, and seizing and destroying drift nets at sea. Sea Shepherd argues that these tactics are necessary to uncover and impede actions that violate international laws protecting wildlife, as the international community has shown itself unwilling or unable to stop species-endangering whaling and fishing practices.

Sea Shepherd staff and equipment have also been on the receiving end of physical violence by members of the fishing industry. In November 1998, Makah seized an inflatable boat belonging to the group and threw rocks at the Sea Shepherd&#x27;s &quot;Sirenian&quot; in response to protests over their whale hunt. In 2005, 11 Sea Shepherd crew were involved in an altercation with sealers while on the ice. The sealers were not charged with any crime, but the activists were arrested and later convicted for approaching too close to the hunt. In 2008, fishermen in the French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon cut the mooring lines of the &quot;Farley Mowat&quot; after hearing Watson make disparaging comments about the deaths of four seal hunters.

In 2009, Paul Watson claimed the organization has sunk ten whaling ships while also destroying millions of dollars worth of equipment. Their practice of attacking and sinking other ships has led to reports of injuries to other sailors as well as the Sea Shepherd crew, including concussions and complications from chemical attacks. Watson considers the actions of Sea Shepherd to be against criminal operations and has called the group an anti-poaching organization. Critics claim that Sea Shepherd&#x27;s actions constitute violations of international law, while Watson has stated that Sea Shepherd believes that their actions constitute an attempt to enforce international conservation laws and international maritime law under the World Charter for Nature adopted by the United Nations. Australia has declared Japan&#x27;s hunt in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary to be illegal, and federal court judge Jim Allsop has stated &quot;there is no practical mechanism by which orders of this court can be enforced&quot;. The lack of official enforcement mechanisms in that law prompted Sea Shepherd to adopt, without official sanction, what it sees as a law enforcement mission. A 2008 academic paper by researchers at Monash University in Melbourne, Victoria, concluded that Sea Shepherd&#x27;s approach could constitute vigilantism, because its seeks to enforce a legal status quo in the face of the international community&#x27;s &quot;inabilities or unwillingness to do so&quot;.

===Anti-whaling controversy===
Watson left Greenpeace in 1977 after being voted off the board over his confrontational methods. Since then, Greenpeace has criticized Sea Shepherd for the group&#x27;s tactics, particularly regarding its interaction with whaling ships while at sea. The rival environmental group maintains Sea Shepherd is a violent organization whose tactics may endanger the lives of fishermen and whalers, and has labelled Watson an extremist. Greenpeace has also stated: &quot;By making it easy to paint anti-whaling forces as dangerous, piratical terrorists, Sea Shepherd could undermine the forces within Japan which could actually bring whaling to an end&quot;. In his 2009 book, &quot;Whaling in Japan&quot;, Jun Morikawa stated that Sea Shepherd&#x27;s confrontational tactics had strengthened Japan&#x27;s resolve to continue with its whaling program by helping to rally domestic support from Japanese citizens who might otherwise have been ambivalent about the practice of hunting and eating whales.

In March 2014 the International Court of Justice ruled Japan&#x27;s whaling program was not for scientific purposes. The Court ordered that Japan &quot;revoke any extant authorization, permit or licence to kill, take or treat whales&quot; and refrain from granting any further permits.&quot; In response to the court ruling, Japan cut its annual whaling quota from 915 to 333. The new quota included only minke whales, and ended the hunting of humpback whales and fin whales. Paul Watson said: &quot;I think we&#x27;ve done an amazing job reducing their quotas and saving whales,&quot; and claimed the actions of Sea Shepherd were a major factor behind Japan&#x27;s decision. In 2017, Sea Shepherd said it would stop sending ships to the Antarctic Ocean in pursuit of Japanese whalers, citing Japan&#x27;s increased use of military surveillance satellites and passage of anti-terrorism laws specifically to thwart Sea Shepherd. Japan passed new anti-terrorism legislation in view of the coming 2020 Olympics, but among its elements, the new law declared the presence of eco-activist vessels near whalers a terrorist offence. The combined measures were deemed to make Sea Shepherd&#x27;s Antarctic operations no longer productive, with Watson noting his organisation &quot;cannot compete with their military-grade technology&quot;.

==Public relations==

The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has been called &quot;media savvy&quot; for their use of the press. The group has worked with journalists and has made statements through press releases to spread its message during various campaigns.

Watson&#x27;s public relations efforts are shown in an episode of &quot;Whale Wars&quot; when he creates an international &quot;media storm&quot; after two Sea Shepherd crewmembers are detained on a Japanese whaling vessel. In his book, &quot;Earthforce!&quot;, Watson advises readers to make up facts and figures when they need to and to deliver them to reporters confidently. He also states that the &quot;truth is irrelevant&quot; due to the nature of mass media. In response to criticism that he manipulates the media, Watson has stated: &quot;What we do is provide the media with the kind of stories they can&#x27;t resist... and this is how we bring attention to what&#x27;s happening to the whales, the seals, the sharks and the other marine conservation campaigns we&#x27;re involved in.&quot;

Sea Shepherd has also used satellite uplinks, webcams, and internet blogging during its operations in the Southern Ocean, and has invited the media to ride along. In 2006, representatives from Seven network and &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine, along with documentary filmmakers, accompanied the group. In a television series entitled &quot;Whale Wars&quot;, Discovery Communications, Inc. documented Sea Shepherd&#x27;s 2008/09 Antarctic campaign against Japanese whalers, following events on the &quot;Steve Irwin&quot;. The program premiered on November 7, 2008, on Discovery&#x27;s Animal Planet network.

Sea Shepherd has received financial contributions from celebrities and businessmen such as entrepreneur Steve Wynn, television personality Bob Barker, and John Paul DeJoria, as well as other celebrities. Martin Sheen, Daryl Hannah, and Richard Dean Anderson have joined the group during protests. Actors including Edward Norton, Pierce Brosnan, Christian Bale, Clive Standen and Emily Deschanel have supported the group through contributions, while William Shatner has also been mentioned as supporting the group. Actress and model Pamela Anderson is an active spokesperson for the group, has participated in several campaigns, served on the board of directors and is a close friend of founder Paul Watson. In 2007, actor Heath Ledger conceived and directed a music video of the Modest Mouse song &quot;King Rat&quot;, intended to raise awareness of the whale hunts taking place each year off the coast of his native Australia. Although Ledger died before the video could be completed, others finished it in his honor and debuted the video online in August 2009. Proceeds from iTunes sales of the video in its first month of release were donated to Sea Shepherd.

From the music industry, Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Leona Lewis, Rick Rubin, and the groups Hawkwind, The Red Paintings, Propagandhi, Gojira, Parkway Drive, Heaven Shall Burn, Stick to Your Guns, The Amity Affliction and Architects have financially supported Sea Shepherd. Architects vocalist Sam Carter is also one of Sea Shepherd&#x27;s British ambassadors. Vegan straight edge band Earth Crisis and Zoltán Téglás of Ignite support SSCS, among other environmental organizations, dedicating songs such as &quot;So Others Live&quot; and &quot;Ultramilitance&quot; to them. Giacomo &quot;Josh&quot; Giorgi, vocalist of now-defunct Italian straight edge hardcore band To Kill is the bosun&#x27;s mate aboard the MY &quot;Steve Irwin&quot;. In 2009, professional surfer Kelly Slater joined a Quiksilver Australia/Sea Shepherd partnership featuring a fundraising clothing line, including board shorts designed by Slater. In 2013 alt-metal band Klogr started supporting Sea Shepherd in Europe through the videos &quot;Guinea Pigs&quot; (2013) and &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; (2014), featuring images from Sea Shepherd documentaries filmed in Taiji and other missions.

The Lush cosmetics company joined with Sea Shepherd to raise awareness about the practice of shark finning in 2008. Lush produced &#x27;Shark Fin Soap&#x27; (punning on &#x27;shark fin soup&#x27;); all sale proceeds were directed to Sea Shepherd.

In Tasmania, Sea Shepherd has been banned from participation in the Australian Wooden Boat Festival on the grounds that its presence could jeopardize the reputation of the organization which aims to celebrate maritime heritage, but not modern maritime issues in Australian waters.

For years, Mexico depended on Sea Shepherd to remove the illegal nets that trap and drown vaquita porpoises in the Gulf of California. In January 2021, Sea Shepherds had to leave the Gulf after a New Year&#x27;s Eve attack where a fisherman rammed a Sea Shepherd vessel. One fisherman died of injuries sustained during the attack. Mexico has invited Sea Shepherd back to help save the vaquita, but will no longer allow them to remove nets.

==Fleet of ships==


Sea Shepherd refer to the ships it has operated as Neptune&#x27;s Navy. , the conservation society operates 12 ships: &quot;Ocean Warrior&quot;, &quot;Brigitte Bardot&quot;, &quot;Bob Barker&quot;, &quot;Steve Irwin&quot;, &quot;Sam Simon&quot;, &quot;John Paul DeJoria&quot;, &quot;Farley Mowat&quot;, &quot;Sharpie&quot;, &quot;Jairo Mora Sandoval&quot;, &quot;White Holly&quot;, &quot;Martin Sheen&quot; and &quot;Sea Eagle&quot;.

The &quot;Steve Irwin&quot; was obtained in 2007 and originally called the &quot;Robert Hunter&quot;, named in honor of Robert Hunter, co-founder of Greenpeace. Irwin&#x27;s widow, Terri, gave her support to Sea Shepherd, saying: &quot;Whales have always been in Steve&#x27;s heart and in 2006 he was investigating the possibility of joining the Sea Shepherd on part of its journey to defend these beautiful animals.&quot; The other ship, the 1200 ton &quot;Bob Barker&quot;, was named after well-known television game show host and animal activist Bob Barker, who made the purchase in Ghana of the retired Norwegian whaling vessel possible with a donation of US$5 million. In February 2010, the &quot;Bob Barker&quot; collided with the Japanese whaling vessel &quot;Yushin Maru No. 3&quot;, tearing a gash in the hull of the &quot;Bob Barker&quot;. In December 2014, the Bob Barker began its pursuit of the illegal fishing vessel, the FV &quot;Thunder&quot;, part of the Bandit 6 and involved in illegally fishing the Patagonian toothfish, which became the longest chase in nautical history covering over 10,000 nautical miles and lasting 110 days.

The group also formerly operated the &quot;Farley Mowat&quot; (impounded by the Canadian government, with Sea Shepherd having stated that they have no intention of paying the legal fines and berthage fees to recover their now obsolete vessel) and the &quot;Ady Gil&quot;, formerly known as the &quot;Earthrace&quot; (sunk after a collision with the whaling security vessel in early 2010) as well as a number of earlier vessels.

Sea Shepherd acquired the &quot;Ocean 7 Adventurer&quot; for its 2010/11 campaign against Japanese whaling in the Antarctic. In November 2010, Mayor Brad Pettitt of Fremantle, Western Australia, christened the vessel &quot;Gojira&quot; with Fremantle as its home port, making this the first Sea Shepherd ship registered in Australia, with an Australian crew. The &quot;Gojira&quot; was renamed in May 2011 after complaints of copyright infringement by Toho.

For the 2011–2012 Antarctic campaign, the organization acquired drone aircraft to assist in their surveillance of the whaling ships.

In July 2012, Sam Simon, a co-creator of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, reportedly donated money to purchase the fourth vessel, a former German icebreaker. The actual ship however turned out to be a former Japanese weather survey vessel, now called the MY &quot;Sam Simon&quot;.

On October 18, 2014, the actor Martin Sheen unveiled Sea Shepherd&#x27;s newest vessel, R/V &quot;Martin Sheen&quot;, named in his honor, and captained by Oona Layolle of France. The name of this vessel carries the prefix &quot;R/V&quot; because it will be engaged in direct action as a research vessel.

In January 2015, two decommissioned, 30-knot, Island-class Coast Guard cutters were spotted flying the Sea Shepherd flag in Annapolis Yacht Basin. In June 2015, Sea Shepherd revealed on their website that they had purchased these vessels. One is named , after an earlier vessel impounded by the Canadian government, and the other was named MY &quot;Jules Verne&quot;, after the author of the 1870 novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;, but was renamed on January 31, 2017.

On December 7, 2017, the organization announced the acquisition of a third Island-class Cutter thanks to a donation from Chris Sharp, a biotech businessman. The vessel was named , and for its maiden mission it will join Operation Milagro in the Gulf of California to help save the endangered vaquita porpoise.

The ships of the fleet have flown the flags of a variety of different nations. Canada, Belize, UK and Togo have revoked the registrations of various vessels. Both the &quot;Steve Irwin&quot; and &quot;Bob Barker&quot; ships now sail under Dutch flag leading to direct complaints by the Japanese government towards Dutch ambassadors. The Netherlands consequently considered revoking the registrations for both vessels but finally decided not to do so.

==Government response==
In testimony on &quot;The Threat of Eco-Terrorism&quot; given to a US congressional subcommittee in 2002, Sea Shepherd was the first group mentioned by an FBI official for having attacked commercial fishing operations by cutting drift nets. An earlier Canadian intelligence report on &quot;single issue terrorism&quot; stated that &quot;Watson and his supporters have been involved in a number of militant actions against whale hunting, driftnet fishing, seal hunting and other related issues&quot; and mentions &quot;activities against logging operations in Canada&quot;. In 2007, Ian Campbell, then the Australian Environment Minister and a vigorous critic of Japan&#x27;s whaling, once opposed Sea Shepherd&#x27;s tactics, saying that it really put the cause of conservation backwards. Due to the 2008 operations against Canadian seal hunters, Danny Williams, Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, called Watson a terrorist and said that Sea Shepherd was not welcome in the province. The group has been accused of eco-terrorism by the Japanese government, whose internationally banned whaling program is a principal focus of the Sea Shepherd. It has also been opposed by some countries that also oppose whaling, including Australia and New Zealand.

Sea Shepherd has based many of its operations out of Australia with foreign crew members being able to travel in and out of the country on tourist visas, but in October 2009, the Australian Immigration Department imposed additional criminal background checks on Watson and his first officer, Peter Hammarstedt, when they applied for visas. Watson criticized the action as a submission to Japanese pressure by the Rudd government. The Australian government rejected the idea it had delayed the visas, and on October 20, 2009, they were issued. By contrast, the Tasmanian Greens and the former Greens Senator Bob Brown, has endorsed and supported Sea Shepherd in various ways, including through advocacy within the Australian government and public endorsement of the group. However, when the &quot;Steve Irwin&quot; returned to Hobart, Tasmania, in February 2009, Australian Federal Police seized film footage and the ship&#x27;s logs, reportedly prompted by complaints from Japan. Brown demanded that the Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, order their immediate return, but a spokesman for the Home Affairs Minister said it was a federal police matter. In 2013, Julie Bishop, the Foreign Minister of Australia, told the press club of Japan, &quot;We do not, and will never, condone reckless, dangerous, unlawful behaviour. And where it occurs on the high seas, we will unreservedly condemn it. The fact that the Sea Shepherd visits Australian ports or some of the Sea Shepherd fleet might be registered in Australia is not indicative in any way of the Australian government&#x27;s support for the organisation.&quot; When Sea Shepherd indicated it was abandoning pursuit of Japanese whalers in 2017, Watson noted the hostility of the governments in the US, Australia and New Zealand, which he accused of acting &quot;in league with Japan&quot; against the organisation.
Officials in Japan have attempted to combat Sea Shepherd at the highest levels, discussing the revocation of the group&#x27;s tax exempt status with their counterparts in the United States. In December 2011, the Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR) and Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha, the two Japanese organizations which operate Japan&#x27;s whaling program, requested an injunction in the US district court in Seattle to stop Sea Shepherd&#x27;s operations against Japanese whalers. The federal court denied the ICR&#x27;s preliminary injunction against SSCS. The ICR and Kyodo Senpaku appealed and, on December 17, 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an injunction against Paul Watson and Sea Shepherd and requiring them to stay at least from ICR vessels. After the court ruling, Paul Watson stepped down and Bob Brown succeeded as the leader of Sea Shepherd, which launched an ultimately rejected appeal to have the injunction set aside. On the appeal&#x27;s conclusion, the Court of Appeals stated that SSCS&#x27;s activities were &quot;the very embodiment of piracy&quot;. This reversed a previous decision by Richard A. Jones, who was removed as trial judge for abuse of discretion. As a result, Paul Watson and US members of Sea Shepherd are currently prohibited by US courts from approaching Japanese whalers, even if they are observed acting in defiance of international law, including by killing whales in protected waters.
In March 2012, reacting to Paul Watson&#x27;s allegation that Maltese politicians were bribed by the Bluefin tuna industry, Prime Minister of Malta Lawrence Gonzi announced that the government would initiate libel proceedings against the Sea Shepherd founder.

In May 2012, Watson was detained by German authorities after he arrived at the Frankfurt Airport based on a request from the government of Costa Rica on the charge of violating navigational regulations. The charge stemmed from an altercation in 2002 took place during filming for the documentary &quot;Sharkwater,&quot; in which Sea Shepherd contended that the other vessel was shark finning in Guatemalan waters. Watson subsequently skipped bail and went into hiding. The Costa Rican government subsequently requested the Interpol to issue a Red Notice arrest request for Watson to its member countries.

Watson said on the Discovery Channel in 2009 that the Dalai Lama had sent a letter of support for Sea Shepherd&#x27;s volunteers accompanied by a wrathful, scowling statue of the deity Hayagriva, which expresses compassion and determination in overcoming obstacles. However, during a visit to Japan in 2010, the Dalai Lama said that while he agrees with the goal of stopping Japan from hunting whales, they should stop using violent methods to achieve that goal.

<doc id="303629" wikidata="Q2067103" url="?curid=303629" title="William Light">
<text>William Light (27 April 1786 – 6 October 1839), also known as Colonel Light, was a British-Malayan naval and army officer. He was the first Surveyor-General of the new British Province of South Australia, known for choosing the site of the colony&#x27;s capital, Adelaide, and for designing the layout of its streets, six city squares, gardens and the figure-eight Adelaide Park Lands, in a plan later sometimes referred to as Light&#x27;s Vision.

==Early life==
Light was born in Kuala Kedah, Kedah (now in Malaysia) on 27 April 1786, the eldest son of Captain Francis Light, founder and Superintendent of Penang, and Martinha (or Martina) Rozells, who was of Portuguese or French, and Siamese or Malay descent. He was thus legally classed as Eurasian, an ethnic designation which granted the designated a middle position between the natives and the Europeans. He was baptised on 31 December 1786, Georgetown, Penang.

He lived in Penang until the age of six (1793), when he was sent to Theberton, a village in Suffolk, England to be educated by friends of his father. These friends were George Doughty, Sheriff of Suffolk, and his wife Anne. He never saw his parents again. His father died in October 1794, and although providing generously for his son&#x27;s education, Light did not inherit his father&#x27;s considerable wealth, as the estate had been ruined by maladministration. He became attached to the Doughtys, and later named his house in Adelaide after the family home. He was well educated, and soon became proficient in French, as well as showing a talent for drawing, watercolour painting and music. He became known in London as a rich East Indian, and attended the court of the Prince of Wales, later King George IV.

== Military career, first marriage, travel==

At the age of 13 in about 1799, Light volunteered for the Royal Navy, in which he served for two years, leaving as a midshipman.

After a spell as a civilian internee in France in 1803–04, he attended his sister Mary&#x27;s wedding to indigo plantation owner George Boyd in Calcutta in March 1805, remaining in India until November 1806, before returning to Europe. He bought a cornetcy in the 4th Dragoons regiment of the British Army on 5 May 1808, being promoted to lieutenant in April 1809 en route to Spain to serve in the Peninsular War, where he learnt Spanish. After courageous service against Napoleon&#x27;s forces from 1809 to 1814, he served under the Duke of Wellington working on mapping, reconnaissance and liaison. He showed both outstanding bravery and kindness in his actions, and was a favourite of Wellington. He went on to serve in the infantry in various parts of Britain – the Channel Islands, Scotland and Ireland – as a captain, after purchasing the rank in November 1814.

After quitting the army with the brevet rank of major, Light married Miss E. Perois in Derry, Ireland, on 24 May 1821, and moved in literary and artistic circles in Paris, Italy and Sicily for a couple of years. However, his young wife died sometime during those years.

In 1823 he returned to Spain to fight the French invasion as aide-de-camp to Sir Robert Wilson, who had raised an international (mostly French) force to help the &quot;Liberales&quot; in their constitutional struggle against King Ferdinand VII. Originally volunteering as a private in the Vigo militia, Light was made a lieutenant-colonel. He was badly wounded at Corunna in Spain.

==Second marriage, travel==
Returning to England in 1824, Light met and fell in love with the beautiful and wealthy 19-year-old Mary Bennet, illegitimate daughter of the 3rd Duke of Richmond, in the London studio of the miniature painter Charlotte Jones. After a whirlwind romance, they married on 16 October 1824. They travelled to Europe, spending a couple of years in France, Switzerland and Italy (mainly Rome), where Light published his &quot;Views of Pompeii&quot; in 1828. Light returned to England, where he bought a yacht, &quot;Gulnare&quot;, after which the couple cruised the Mediterranean for some years. In 1830 they went to Egypt, where Light first met promoters of a new colony in Australia. Light made numerous sketches and Mary studied Egyptology while in Egypt, becoming a friend and keen correspondent of Egyptologist John Gardner Wilkinson. The couple became friends with Muhammad Ali, Pasha and founder of modern Egypt.

Light sailed for England in 1831 in his own yacht to help recruit British men for the Pasha&#x27;s navy. The process became prolonged, and Light stayed in England until 1835, while Mary continued her studies, travelling to Thebes for a second time and writing detailed journals of her travels and discoveries. Light separated from Mary in 1832, after she had formed a relationship with another officer. The couple never divorced, and Mary retained the surname Light for herself and three children she had by other men in 1833, 1834 and 1835.

Light helped Muhammad Ali to establish a modern navy, sailing his own yacht to England to help recruit British men for the Pasha&#x27;s navy. He captained the paddle steamer the &quot;Nile&quot; from London to Alexandria to join the Egyptian Navy, reaching Alexandria in September 1834. John Hindmarsh had prepared the steamer for delivery at Blackwall Yard on the River Thames, travelled as a passenger on the ship on its journey to Alexandria, and was made captain of the ship by November.

Light started a relationship with the 21-year-old Maria Gandy (born 23 November 1811), a woman of humble stock, who was his companion for the rest of his life.

==Surveyor-General of South Australia==
By 1835, negotiations had been completed for the founding of the new British Province of South Australia, according to the scheme of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, intended as a self-supporting free colony.

Light had given Hindmarsh a letter of introduction to Colonel Charles James Napier, who was the recently designated Governor of the new colony. However, Napier was not interested in the position, and upon hearing this, Hindmarsh rushed to London and lobbied for the position, after seeing Napier in Portsmouth in May 1835. Napier recommended to the authorities that Light be given the post of Governor, but Hindmarsh had already been promised it. Light returned to London in January 1836, and on 4 February was appointed Surveyor-General of South Australia instead.

On 1 May 1836 Light sailed for South Australia with Maria Gandy, two of her young brothers (William (19) and Edward (10)), and some of his survey staff, on the survey brig, &quot;Rapid&quot;, along with the nine other ships in the &quot;First Fleet&quot;. The ship reached Kangaroo Island on 17 August 1836. Sailing from Nepean Bay on 23 September, Light started exploring Gulf St Vincent, sailing first past Rapid Bay, then up to Port Adelaide before returning to Rapid Bay. In the meantime &quot;Cygnet&quot; had arrived at Nepean Bay, Kangaroo Island, with the assistant surveyors. Soon afterwards &quot;Africaine&quot; arrived, with Colonial Secretary Robert Gouger and other colonial officers anxious to know where the settlement should be situated. Light suggested that the ships land at Holdfast Bay for the meantime, while he went with a group to explore further. The group encountered a group of Indigenous Australians for the first time at Rapid Bay (belonging to one of the Ramindjeri tribes) and was reported to have established a friendly and cooperative relationship with them. After finding the Port River, Light then sailed across to Port Lincoln, on Spencer&#x27;s Gulf, but found the area unsuitable. In addition to lack of surface water, Light found navigation of Spencer&#x27;s Gulf and southern entry into Boston Bay more hazardous. On 18 December he decided on the site of Adelaide for the new capital, and headed north to survey the coast north with a view to its being the site for a harbour. HMS &quot;Buffalo&quot; arrived at Holdfast Bay on 28 December. That same day Governor Hindmarsh landed and, all pre-requisites having been met, proclaimed the commencement of colonial government (henceforth celebrated as Proclamation Day).

==Designing Adelaide==
Instructions for Light&#x27;s role in the expedition &quot;for the purpose of effecting such a survey of the different harbours and the adjoining land as may be necessary to the correct determination of the best site for the first town&quot; were given in a document dated 9 March 1836.

There Light was the first to accurately chart the Port Adelaide River, before selecting the location and designing and laying out the plan of the City of Adelaide. This he did, and managed to plan and found the city in only eight weeks, after a 14-day delay caused by George Strickland Kingston&#x27;s incompetence.

===Location===
The site chosen by Light spanned the River Torrens, or Karra Wirra Parri, as it was known by the local people. One of the reasons he chose the location was because he observed that the Adelaide Hills would result in higher rainfall on the Adelaide plain. This was a promising indicator of good conditions for avoidance of drought-prone areas. Settlement sites on Encounter Bay, Kangaroo Island, Spencer&#x27;s Gulf, the West coast of St Vincent&#x27;s Gulf and Holdfast Bay (now known as Glenelg) had been rejected. The site had many challenges, but Light wrote that he chose the site &quot;because it was on a beautiful and gently rising ground, and formed altogether a better connection with the river than any other place&quot;.

Despite the natural advantages of the site, Light faced opposition, mainly from Hindmarsh, who wished to locate the city near the River Murray mouth near Encounter Bay, and some of settlers, who objected to the distance from the port. The opposition to the plan culminated in a meeting on 10 February, at which a letter from Light to Resident Commissioner James Hurtle Fisher outlining the reasons for his choice, praising the good soil, extensive neighbouring plains and sheep grazing, a plentiful year-round supply of excellent fresh water, easy communication with its harbour, proximity to the Murray River, as well as the beauty of the country. The letter included a personal note:
&quot;The reasons that led me to fix Adelaide where it is I do not expect to be generally understood or calmly judged of at present. My enemies however, by disputing their validity in every particular, have done me the good service of fixing the whole of the responsibility upon me. I am perfectly willing to bear it, and I leave it to posterity and not to them, to decide whether I am entitled to praise or to blame&quot;. An amendment proposed by Dr Wright and seconded by Deputy Surveyor George Strickland Kingston upheld Light&#x27;s selection in March 1837.

After a quarrel between Hindmarsh and Resident Commissioner Fisher, which also drew in other settlers and officials, Colonial Secretary Gouger, one of Light&#x27;s chief supporters, was suspended and replaced. In December 1837, Judge John Jeffcott was drowned at Encounter Bay (himself being a supporter of Hindmarsh&#x27;s view and at the time trying to prove the safety of the Bay). Soon after this, Hindmarsh complained formally about the slow progress of the surveys, while at the same time hindering Light&#x27;s work. Parties explored nearby areas, Light continued with his work on plans, supported by most settlers, and in July of that year, Hindmarsh was recalled.

===City plan===

When Light was designing Adelaide, his plans included surrounding the city with of park. Of these, he reserved 32 acres for one of the world&#x27;s earliest public cemeteries, now called West Terrace Cemetery.

Light referred to his unique figure-eight of open space as &quot;Adelaide Park&quot;. Later, the purchase of the lands of Light&#x27;s Adelaide Park, and repeated correspondence and discussions about the Adelaide Park land/lands eventually corrupted his original name to &quot;Adelaide Park Lands&quot;.

Light placed the city to the north and south of the river, avoiding areas prone to flooding and making best use of the local topography. His survey plan divided the land into 1042 square one-acre lots; north of the Torrens (North Adelaide) and to the south (South Adelaide, now known as the city centre). Light&#x27;s Plan reserved for town squares (38 acres) and government buildings (4 Town Sections of Public Reserves with Victoria Square frontages: now the Old Treasury Building/Lands Offices; GPO; Supreme Court, and Magistrates Court sites). 
&lt;br&gt;In March 1837, after 116 preliminary buyers had selected their portions, the rest of the Town Sections were auctioned. Due to local demands Light also planned Town Sections at the old Port Adelaide harbour and 29 were selected.

Adelaide&#x27;s characteristic geometrical grid pattern is not unprecedented: apart from earlier examples going back to ancient Greece, it follows part of a series of rules created by Spanish planners for their colonial cities, known as the &quot;Laws of the Indies&quot;. They included the grid pattern with a main thoroughfare, centred around a main square. There are many historical precedents for five squares, including Philadelphia in America, designed in 1682 by surveyor Thomas Holme, however Light&#x27;s Plan has six public squares. There are however no records showing that Light deliberately copied any cities or rules for planning, and his implementation of planning principles for a beautiful and healthy city, melded sensitively and intelligently with the landscape, is unique.

&quot;Light&#x27;s vision&quot; was to create an urban form which complemented nature, done with conscious purpose. Long before Light was engaged, the colonisation of South Australia had been designed as a kind of social experiment, drawing on the thinking of many notable minds: Jeremy Bentham, George Grote, Robert Owen, John Stuart Mill, and, closest to home, Edward Gibbon Wakefield. Cities such as the ancient Greek city-states, those in Spain’s colonies of the New World and British Canada, Pennsylvania and other American cities, New South Wales, Van Diemen’s Land and Swan River Colony had been carried out. His plan bears a close resemblance to Gother Mann’s 1788 &quot;Plan for Torento Harbour&quot; (which was never laid out as planned, on the north shore of Lake Ontario, although a differently laid out town, named York, was established to its west, which later eventually expanded east and north covering the unrealised &#x27;Torento&#x27; model township site, and renamed Toronto, Canada), particularly in the square &quot;Town Acres&quot;.

The oldest known version of Light&#x27;s plan was drawn by a 16-year-old draughtsman in 1837, to instructions from Light, some time after the streets were named on 23 May of that year. Primary source researcher Kelly Henderson has confirmed that there is an extant original 1838 cadastral map of Adelaide, held by the State Library of South Australia. It was commissioned from Light, Finniss &amp; Co. by the South Australian Company, shows the company&#x27;s properties, and is signed with his firm&#x27;s name by William Light, at the firm&#x27;s office in Stephens Place, [Adelaide] in Oct 1838.

==After resignation==
By this time Light had spent a considerable amount of his own fortune on his work, and was suffering ill-health. He resigned from his position on 21 June 1838, after being directed to survey within a week and refusing to use less accurate surveying methods for country surveys. In July 1838, he formed a private company, Light, Finniss &amp; Co., with assistant surveyors B. T. Finniss (arr. &quot;Cygnet&quot;), Henry Nixon (arr. &quot;Navarino&quot;) and William Jacob (among those who came out on the &quot;Rapid&quot;), and draughtsman Robert G. Thomas (being among those who came out on the &quot;Cygnet&quot;), offering a range of services to prospective purchasers of city and country properties, and to local government bodies. By agreement with the new Governor George Gawler, Light surveyed the Port River, and, for William Finke, the town of Glenelg. However Light had to resign due to ill health by September, after Finniss had taken up a new appointment under Gawler as Deputy Surveyor-General.

His war wounds troubled him, and he suffered from tuberculosis, but he gained enjoyment from cultivating good crops of vegetables in his garden.

On 22 January 1839 the Land and Survey Office, along with the adjoining huts belonging to Light and Resident Commissioner James Hurtle Fisher, and the first Government House, burned down, taking some of the province&#x27;s early records and many of Light&#x27;s possessions with it. The fire was attributed to arson. He had just begun work on preparing his journals, kept for 30 years, for publication, having left cases of papers for safety in the survey office, and apart from an excerpt already prepared, the journals were lost – a great blow to Light.

==Other activities and personal life==
Light spoke several languages and was a gifted and prolific painter and sketcher. Many of his watercolours were published in London in 1823 and 1828, and a number of his works, including an incomplete self-portrait in oils, are in the collection of Art Gallery of South Australia on North Terrace. Others are housed in the State Library of South Australia and in the Adelaide Town Hall. He often sold his works to support himself, but many were lost when fire destroyed the Land and Survey Office and his adjacent hut in January 1839.

In December 1837 Light led an exploration from Adelaide, discovering and naming the Barossa Range, after which the Barossa Valley was named.

===Maria Gandy===

Maria (pronounced &quot;Mariah&quot;) Gandy (23 November 1811 – 14 December 1847) was designated by Light&#x27;s Will as his housekeeper, but thought to be his de facto wife. The status of their relationship caused the couple to be shunned by Adelaide society, and they had few visitors at their home (only two society women ever visited Gandy at her home), which they shared with Gandy&#x27;s young brothers for some years.

They first lived aboard the survey brig &quot; Rapid&quot;, then in a tent at Rapid Bay, and then in a house made of bark and reeds, which was completely destroyed by fire, along with all of their personal belongings, in 1839. The four-roomed brick built cottage, built by William Gandy, was named Theberton House, after Light&#x27;s childhood residence at Theberton Hall in Suffolk.

Another brother, George Gandy, who arrived in 1838, named his child William Light Gandy in 1840.

On 7 July 1840, nine months after Light&#x27;s death, Maria Gandy married Dr George Mayo, with whom she had 4 children. They lived in the Thebarton cottage for a while, before moving to Carrington Street. In 1847, aged 36, Maria Mayo died of tuberculosis, not long after the death of their fourth child, and was buried in an unmarked grave in West Terrace Cemetery. The 100 acres of Section 1 and the four Town Acres bequeathed to her were intact, and their rents and profits were accorded to her husband.

On the 200th anniversary of her birth on 23 November 2011, the Maria Gandy Bicentennial Memorial was unveiled on the corner of Albert and Maria Streets in the inner western suburb of Thebarton (so named because of a typographical error) near the site of their cottage, to honour Maria. On each of four sides is an inscription celebrating her roles as pioneer, settler, carer and mother.

Some strange drawings and diagrams discovered in the Flinders University library collections of Mayo and Dutton papers suggested that Gandy &quot;moved around the state with an entourage of dwarfs&quot;.

Today, historians view Gandy as providing strength to the sickly Light, helping him to achieve his goals while being treated as a pariah by many fellow pioneers.

== Later life, death and burial==
Gandy nursed Light for three years while he was invalided by tuberculosis, until his death on 6 October 1839 in Adelaide, aged 53. Reverend Charles Beaumont Howard, the only Anglican clergyman in South Australia at the time, had refused to visit him because of his relationship with Gandy.

On 10 October 1839, after a group of mourners met at his home, his funeral service took place at Trinity Church on North Terrace, after which the procession walked to the nearby Light Square. It was attended by hundreds, many of whom wept openly, and a gun salute was fired and the flag at Government House lowered to half-mast.

Gandy was executrix and sole beneficiary of Light&#x27;s estate (which consisted mainly of unpaid debts) and paid for the funeral. The funeral took place on 10 October, and his body taken for burial at Light Square. More than 3,000 people attended the burial, including many who had been antagonistic towards him. The sole remaining document authored by Light was his will.

A few days later a meeting of his friends, chaired by John Morphett, assembled to raise money for a memorial. The foundation stone for the memorial was laid by James Hurtle Fisher in 1843, and witnessed by a select few, but the edifice itself, designed by George Strickland Kingston free of charge, was not completed until February 1845. It was a pentagonal elaborate structure, built of freestone and topped with what was described by Francis Dutton as a Gothic cross high.

== Legacy, recognition, memorials ==
The plan of the city of Adelaide stands as a lasting legacy to Light&#x27;s genius, praised both in the early days and more recent literature.

===Light&#x27;s Vision===
The most well-known memorial of Light is the statue now on Montefiore Hill and known as Light&#x27;s Vision, which points southwards towards the River Torrens and the city centre.

Edinburgh sculptor William Birnie Rhind&#x27;s design for the statue was selected by committee on 23 December 1904, and architects Garlick, Sibley and Wooldridge (consisting of only Henry Evan Sibley (1867–1917) and Charles W. Wooldridge at that point) designed the pedestal. The statue of Light was unveiled on 27 November 1906 in its original location at the northern end of Victoria Square, (opposite the General Post Office). The ceremony was presided over by the Mayor of Adelaide, Theodore Bruce, attended by many notables, including the Chief Justice, John Hannah Gordon, and the Premier, Thomas Price. The Governor of South Australia, Sir George Le Hunte, gave an address in which he praised Light highly, cheered on by the crowd.

The statue was moved in 1938 to its present position on Montefiore Hill at the suggestion of the Pioneers&#x27; Association of South Australia, to commemorate the centenary of Light&#x27;s death, and the renamed &quot;Light`s Vision&quot; at the suggestion of PASA president Sir Henry Newland. Legend says that Light stood on Montefiore Hill when he began planning the city, but this is not confirmed.

The inscription on the plaque at the front reads: Colonel William Light First Surveyor General; Fixed the site and laid out the city of Adelaide in 1836; Erected by citizens; 1906. Several plaques have been added to the back.

===Other symbols of recognition===
Light&#x27;s achievements have been commemorated in a number of ways, including:
* Light Square, Adelaide, where he was buried. He remains the only person legally buried within the Adelaide &quot;square mile&quot;.

*His grave monument, the original version having been designed by Kingston as the result of a competition, a pentagonal structure made of sandstone and topped with a Gothic cross carved by Samuel Lewis and completed in 1844. In 1876 the Adelaide City Council placed a white marble tablet on a panel of the monument, with an inscription acknowledging the pioneers of South Australia for erecting the memorial.
**The sandstone weathered badly, and the memorial was replaced by the winning design in a competition, by architect Herbert Louis Jackman. It featured a bronze tripod and theodolite on a tall column made of red granite sourced from the Murray Bridge area, with a base of Monarto grey granite, and was unveiled in June 1905 by mayor of Adelaide Theodore Bruce after an address by Deputy Governor Sir Samuel Way. It notes that Light is the only person legally buried after settlement within the city square. The 1876 marble tablet was removed, renovated and mounted on slate, and afterwards in the vestibule of the State Library. The gravesite and monument were upgraded during 1985–86 and again in 2008.
**In 2019, an Adelaide conservationist proposed the rebuilding of the original monument on North Terrace, dedicating it to the Kaurna people, the Old Colonists of the South Australian Association, and the early settlers, in time for the 200th anniversary of the founding of Adelaide (2036).
*Light Passage, located in the Port River between Pelican Point and Torrens Island.
* The Colonel Light Hotel. (Light Square, corner Currie Street) Established in 1849 as the Sir Robert Peel Hotel, in 1888 it was renamed the Colonel Light Hotel.
* The Light River, which has its source at Waterloo, and runs to its mouth in the Gulf St Vincent.
*The County of Light was named after the Light River in 1842.
*In 1905, after the unveiling of the new grave monument, Light’s self-portrait in oils was presented to the Art Gallery by George Gibbes Mayo, son of George Mayo, who had died in 1894. He gifted the painting on condition that the State Government contribute £1,000 towards the replacement grave monument to the Light.
* The naming of the garden suburb of Colonel Light Gardens in the 1920s.
*Light Memorial at Rapid Bay – a cairn commemorating Light&#x27;s landing at Rapid Bay, where he performed his first mainland survey in 1836, unveiled in 1928.
*A memorial known as the Colonel Light Survey Marker, in the form of an obelisk and plaque, was created for placement near the corner of North and West Terraces, marking the approximate location of the Land and Survey offices and of Light&#x27;s and Fisher&#x27;s huts, which were destroyed by fire in January 1839. The memorial was unveiled on 16 July 1929 by Lord Mayor John Lavington Bonython, but went into storage in 2011, before being re-situated outside the main entrance of the new Royal Adelaide Hospital.
*Located at the northern end of the Victoria Square, the State Survey Mark commemorates the placing of the first peg for the survey of the city by Light on 11 January 1837. This survey mark is the reference point for all other survey marks in South Australia. The mark was unveiled, along with a commemorative plaque by then Minister of Lands, Susan Lenehan on 21 April 1989.
*Theberton House was demolished to make way for a factory/warehouse in 1926 by Colton, Palmer and Preston Ltd. A plaque to commemorate Light&#x27;s cottage was unveiled nearby in 1927. The site was taken over by the South Australian Brewing Company and the plaque was situated inside the old West End Brewery building. In 1995, a second plaque was erected by the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia in the brewery carpark, in Hindmarsh.
* Light Square in the Adelaide suburb of Marion (cnr. Nixon and Market Streets). Four cairns commemorate the early history of the area and original survey of the village by Light, Finniss and Co. in 1838.
*William Light School, a state government school located in the Adelaide suburb of Plympton. In 2017 it was renamed Plympton International College.
* A plaque on the Jubilee 150 Walkway, located along North Terrace in 1986, commemorates William Light.
*Each April the Adelaide City Council celebrates Light’s birthday, a tradition which began in 1859 when four of the colony&#x27;s founders and friends of Light, George Palmer, Jacob Barrow Montefiore, Raikes Currie and Alexander Lang Elder, presented a large ornamental silver bowl known as the &quot;Loving Cup&quot;, made in England in 1766–77, to the mayor and council, with the request that a toast be made to Light each year on his birthday. A portrait of Light created in 1836 was presented by an admirer to hang in the Council Chamber.
*Twelve paintings by Light, including two self portraits, are in the collection of the Art Gallery of South Australia. A portrait of Light by George Jones RA from about 1815 also hangs in the National Portrait Gallery, London in London.

His life was dramatised in the Max Afford stage play &quot;Awake My Love&quot;, which was based on an earlier play of Afford&#x27;s, &quot;Colonel Light - The Founder&quot;.
===New 1837 watercolour discovered 2019===
A watercolour painted by Light between January and April 1837 depicting the site of the Land/Survey Office and Light and Fisher&#x27;s huts, being a variation on Light&#x27;s &quot;Commencement of Settlement in South Australia, 1837&quot;, with Mount Lofty in the background, was discovered in a garage in September 2019. It is regarded as hugely significant, being one of the earliest depictions of Adelaide. However, the painting passed in at auction and was afterwards sold to a private collector for , despite being valued at between and and being hailed by fine arts dealer Jim Elder as a &quot;rare and historic painting&quot;, who was &quot;bitterly disappointed&quot; that it would be lost to South Australian society. He said that &quot;months of painstaking art history and genealogical research&quot; into its provenance had led to a man called Shimmin, who had worked for Light’s colleague William Jacob in the Barossa Valley and in whose family it had remained for generations. In the week before the auction, a television station had aired an &quot;item from an interstate amateur art historian debunking the provenance of [the] work&quot;.

==In the arts==
===Stage===

In October 2019, co-commissioned by Adelaide&#x27;s OzAsia festival and Penang&#x27;s George Town Festival, a play was created and staged by Australian writer and director Thomas Henning in collaboration with Malaysian duo TerryandTheCuz, named &quot;Light&quot;. Rather than presenting a by-the-numbers historical retelling, the play explores the personal circumstances first of Francis Light and his pivotal role in Penang&#x27;s modern history, and then of his son William in Adelaide. The roles of the women in their lives are explored, as well as the geopolitical situation of the time which influenced the decisions of the elder and junior Lights. The life of Martina Rozells is also brought to life. The play is mainly about family, aiming to use Light&#x27;s inner perspective to look at the world, and touches on &quot;the values and notions of nationalism&quot;. Henning used the Mayo and Dutton collections at Flinders University for all of his research for the play. He sees Light as an unfulfilled individual, despite all of his success; his life was &quot;also lonely and drifting&quot;.

==Misconceptions==
===Port Adelaide===
The 29 Town Sections which Light allotted for the harbour area of Port Adelaide have been all but forgotten as part of his plan, which is often mistakenly thought to include only the city centre, with the North Adelaide part tacked on afterwards.

===Christchurch, NZ===
It is sometimes claimed that Light also designed the city centre of Christchurch in New Zealand. However, this is not possible; Light died in Adelaide in 1839, whereas Christchurch was only laid out by Englishman Edward Jollie in March 1850.
The shared principles of the town planning of Adelaide, South Australia, and Christchurch, New Zealand, were due to both being examples of E. G. Wakefield&#x27;s &#x27;Art of Colonization&#x27; and Benthamite town planning.

<text>The Nineteenth Century was a British monthly literary magazine founded in 1877 by James Knowles. It is regarded by historians as &#x27;one of the most important and distinguished monthlies of serious thought in the last quarter of the nineteenth century&#x27;.

==Editorial policy==

The magazine was designed as an &#x27;utterly impartial&#x27; forum for debate and discussion among leading intellectuals. Many of the early supporters and contributors to &quot;The Nineteenth Century&quot; were members of the Metaphysical Society, of which Knowles had been secretary. The first issue, for example, contained pieces by former Society members Lord Tennyson, William Gladstone and Cardinal Manning. It quickly became one of the most successful literary magazines in Britain, selling over 20,000 copies a month by early 1878.

An important part of the magazine&#x27;s success was its regular &#x27;Modern Symposium&#x27; section. This offered a series of essays and responses from different authors on subjects such as science or religion, collected together and published as a single structured debate. In this way the magazine quickly gained a reputation as a responsive forum where its contributors were given freedom to disagree without editorial interference. However, the magazine&#x27;s focus on publishing established literary figures meant that it often excluded younger or unknown writers. Although it generally lived up to its reputation as a &#x27;neutral ground&#x27;, the magazine did at times abandon impartiality to support positions dear to Knowles himself. For example, it was famously at the forefront of the campaign to prevent the building of a Channel Tunnel between Britain and France in 1882.

==&quot;The Nineteenth Century and After&quot;==
In 1901 the title was changed to The Nineteenth Century and After. To emphasise this change, a two-headed Janus-symbol of an old man and a young woman (the former representing the nineteenth century and the latter the twentieth) was added to the cover. Knowles was prevented from simply renaming it &quot;The Twentieth Century&quot; because the copyright to that name was already owned by someone else, who allegedly demanded a ransom for the rights to use it. 

Knowles remained editor until his death, in 1908. During the twentieth century the magazine became politically more right-wing. 

The magazine&#x27;s title was finally changed to The Twentieth Century in 1951. After 1968 its publication cycle was &#x27;irregular&#x27;; it ceased publication completely in 1972.

==Editors==
1877–1908 – James Thomas Knowles
&lt;br&gt;1908–1919 – William Wray Skilbeck
&lt;br&gt;1919–1925 – George A. B. Dewar
&lt;br&gt;1925–1930 – Carrol Romer
&lt;br&gt;1930–1934 – Charles Reginald Schiller Harris
&lt;br&gt;1934–1938 – Arnold Wilson
&lt;br&gt;1938–1946 – Frederick Augustus Voigt
&lt;br&gt;1947–1952 – Michael Goodwin
&lt;br&gt;1952–195? – Bernard Wall

During the magazine&#x27;s final years it was run &#x27;on a voluntary basis&#x27; by an editorial board chaired by Eirene Skilbeck, daughter of William Skilbeck and granddaughter of James Knowles.

<text>The following lists events that happened during [[1931]] in [[Afghanistan]].

King Nader Shah further consolidates his position, and continues to bring the country into a more settled state, as is noted by traders at the end of the year. Relations with foreign powers continue to be friendly, but the immigration of Europeans is not encouraged, and only a small number of European advisers are retained in the country. King Nadir devotes special attention to the reorganization of the army and the control of the national finances.

==Incumbents==
* Monarch – Mohammed Nadir Shah
* Prime Minister – Mohammad Hashim Khan

==April 1931==
After a campaign of several months, the king&#x27;s brother, Shah Mahmud, succeeds in driving Ibrahim Beg, &quot;the Robin Hood of Bokhara,&quot; who has been stirring up disaffection in the northeast, across the Oxus into Soviet territory, where he is apprehended and executed. Shah Mahmud&#x27;s victory is celebrated at the annual festival of national independence in August.

==May 1931==
A consignment of 10,000 rifles and large quantities of ammunition arrives in Afghanistan from France.

<doc id="303633" wikidata="Q107287536" url="?curid=303633" title="Golan">
<text>Golan (; ) is the name of a biblical town later known from the works of Josephus (first century CE) and Eusebius (&quot;Onomasticon&quot;, early 4th century CE). Archaeologists localize the biblical city of Golan at Sahm el-Jaulān, a Syrian village east of Wadi ar-Ruqqad in the Daraa Governorate, where early Byzantine ruins were found. Israeli historical geographer, Zev Vilnay, tentatively identified the town Golan with the Goblana (Gaulan) of the Talmud which he thought to be the ruin &quot;ej-Jelêbîne&quot; on the Wâdy Dabûra, near the Lake of Huleh, by way of a corruption of the site&#x27;s original name. 

According to Vilnay, the village took its name from the district Gaulanitis (Golan). The ruin is not far from the Daughters of Jacob Bridge. The traces of the town were described by G. Schumacher in the late 19th-century as being &quot;a desert ruin&quot;, having &quot;no visible remains of importance, but [having] the appearance of great antiquity.&quot;

In the Grecised form Gaulanitis (), it is the name of the region apparently named for the town of Golan. During much of the Hellenistic period, when the name Gaulanitis was coined, the region was part of the Seleucid Empire. In Roman times it was shared between the Roman provinces of Judaea and Phoenice.

==Hebrew Bible==
The area is referred to in the Hebrew Bible as the territory of Manasseh in the conquered territory of Bashan: Golan was the most northerly of the three cities of refuge east of the Jordan River (). Manasseh gave this Levitical city to the Gershonite Levites (; ). According to the Bible, the Israelites conquered Golan, taking it from the Amorites.

==Persian period==
During the Persian period (c. 539–332 BCE) the Golan region, together with the Bashan, formed the satrapy of Karnaim.

==Hellenistic and Early Roman periods==
Now named Gaulanitis, the area formed a district all by itself during the early Hellenistic period. Once the Seleucid Empire started its gradual collapse, the Golan became a target for Iturean and other Arab tribes. At the same time it was enveloped by the regional wars fought by Hasmonean ruler Alexander Jannaeus (r. 103-76 BCE) against the Nabatean kings Obodas I and Aretas III between ca. 93–80 BCE, leading to the conquest of the Golan by Jannaeus. 

In 63 BCE the entire former Seleucid realm was conquered by Roman general Pompey, and the Golan is settled by the Itureans. In 23 BCE the Jewish king Herod the Great, a client ruler loyal to Rome, receives the rule over the wider Hauran region. He leaves it to his heirs, who hold it until the death of Agrippa II at the end of the first century CE.

The city of Golan was known to Josephus. Near Golan, Alexander Jannaeus was ambushed by King Obodas I of the Nabateans. It formed the eastern boundary of Galilee and was part of the tetrarchy of Philip. It was described by Eusebius in his Onomasticon as a large village that gave its name to the surrounding country.

==Late Roman and Byzantine periods==
The region was prosperous between the 2nd and the 7th century CE when pagan communities were step by step replaced by Christian ones. A different view is that the Christians of the Golan were Ghassanids, an Arab tribe originally from Yemen, used by the Byzantines as frontier guards since the end of the 5th century. An important Jewish presence was attested by archaeology since the Roman period in the Golan, and by the 6th century the population of the Byzantine Golan was made up by Jews and Christian Ghassanids.

The Golan was prosperous during the Roman and Byzantine periods, but had a purely rural character and lacked any larger towns.

<text>In condensed matter physics, quantum hydrodynamics (QHD)&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1007/978-3-319-05437-7--pp-103-152&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; is most generally the study of hydrodynamic-like systems which demonstrate quantum mechanical behavior. They arise in semiclassical mechanics in the study of metal and semiconductor devices, in which case being derived from the Boltzmann transport equation combined with Wigner quasiprobability distribution. In quantum chemistry they arise as solutions to chemical kinetic systems, in which case they are derived from the Schrödinger equation by way of Madelung equations.

An important system of study in quantum hydrodynamics is that of superfluidity. Some other topics of interest in quantum hydrodynamics are quantum turbulence, quantized vortices, second and third sound, and quantum solvents. The quantum hydrodynamic equation is an equation in Bohmian mechanics, which, it turns out, has a mathematical relationship to classical fluid dynamics (see Madelung equations). 

Some common experimental applications of these studies are in liquid helium (3He and 4He), and of the interior of neutron stars and the quark–gluon plasma. Many famous scientists have worked in quantum hydrodynamics, including Richard Feynman, Lev Landau, and Pyotr Kapitsa.

<text>Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa or Peter Kapitza (, ; – 8 April 1984) was a leading Soviet physicist and Nobel laureate, whose research focused on low-temperature physics.

== Biography ==
Kapitsa was born in Kronstadt, Russian Empire, to the Bessarabian Leonid Petrovich Kapitsa (), a military engineer who constructed fortifications, and to the Volhynian Olga Ieronimovna Kapitsa, from a noble Polish Stebnicki family. Besides Russian, the Kapitsa family also spoke Romanian.

Kapitsa&#x27;s studies were interrupted by the First World War, in which he served as an ambulance driver for two years on the Polish front. He graduated from the Petrograd Polytechnical Institute in 1918. His wife and two children died in the flu epidemic of 1918–19. He subsequently studied in Britain, working for over ten years with Ernest Rutherford in the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and founding the influential Kapitza club. He was the first director (1930–34) of the Mond Laboratory in Cambridge.

In the 1920s he originated techniques for creating ultrastrong magnetic fields by injecting high current for brief periods into specially constructed air-core electromagnets. In 1928 he discovered the linear relation between resistivity and magnetic field strength in various metals under very strong magnetic fields.

In 1934 Kapitsa returned to the USSR to visit his parents 
and to attend the Mendeleeff Congress,
but the Soviet Union prevented him from travelling back to Great Britain.

As his equipment for high-magnetic field research remained in Cambridge (although later Ernest Rutherford negotiated with the British government the possibility of shipping it to the USSR), he changed the direction of his research to the study of low temperature phenomena, beginning with a critical analysis of the existing methods for achieving low temperatures. In 1934 he developed new and original apparatus (based on the adiabatic principle) for making significant quantities of liquid helium.

Kapitsa formed the Institute for Physical Problems, in part using equipment which the Soviet government bought from the Mond Laboratory in Cambridge (with the assistance of Rutherford, once it was clear that Kapitsa would not be permitted to return).

In the USSR, Kapitsa began a series of experiments to study liquid helium. This research culminated with the 1937 discovery of superfluidity (another expression of the state of matter that gives rise to superconductivity). Beginning with a letter to the editor of &quot;Science&quot; on 8 January 1938 where he reported the absence of measurable viscosity in liquid helium-4 cooled below 1.8 K, Kapitza documented the properties of helium-4 superfluid in a series of papers. This was the body of work for which he was later awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, &quot;basic inventions and discoveries in the area of low-temperature physics&quot;.

In 1939 he developed a new method for liquefaction of air with a low-pressure cycle using a special high-efficiency expansion turbine. Consequently, during World War II he was assigned to head the Department of Oxygen Industry attached to the USSR Council of Ministers, where he developed his low-pressure expansion techniques for industrial purposes. He invented high power microwave generators (1950–1955) and discovered a new kind of continuous high pressure plasma discharge with electron temperatures over 1,000,000 K.

In November 1945 Kapitsa quarreled with Lavrentiy Beria, head of the NKVD and in charge of the Soviet atomic bomb project, writing to Joseph Stalin about Beria&#x27;s ignorance of physics and his arrogance. Stalin backed Kapitsa, telling Beria he had to cooperate with the scientists. Kapitsa refused to meet Beria: &quot;If you want to speak to me, then come to the Institute.&quot; Stalin offered to meet Kapitsa, but this never happened.

Immediately after the war, a group of prominent Soviet scientists (including Kapitsa in particular) lobbied the government to create a new technical university, the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. Kapitsa taught there for many years. From 1957, he was also a member of the presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and at his death in 1984 was the only presidium member who was not also a member of the Communist Party.

In 1966 Kapitsa was allowed to visit Cambridge to receive the Rutherford Medal and Prize. While dining at his old college, Trinity, he found he did not have the required gown. He asked to borrow one, but a college servant asked him when he last dined at high table, &quot;Thirty-two years&quot; replied Kapitza. Within moments the servant returned, not with any gown, but Kapitsa&#x27;s own.
In 1978 Kapitsa won the Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for his basic inventions and discoveries in the area of low-temperature physics&quot; and was also cited for his long term role as a leader in the development of this area. He shared the prize with Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson, who won for discovering the cosmic microwave background.

&quot;Kapitsa resistance&quot; is the thermal resistance (which causes a temperature discontinuity) at the interface between liquid helium and a solid. The &quot;Kapitsa–Dirac effect&quot; is a quantum mechanical effect consisting of the diffraction of electrons by a standing wave of light. In fluid dynamics, the &quot;Kapitza number&quot; is a dimensionless number characterizing the flow of thin films of fluid down an incline.

== Personal life ==
Pyotr Kapitsa had the nickname &quot;Centaurus&quot;. This arose when once Artem Alikhanian asked Kapitsas&#x27; student Shalnikov &quot;is your supervisor a human or a beast?&quot; to which Shalnikov responded that he is a Centaurus, i.e. he can be human but also he can get angry and hit you with hooves like a horse. Kapitsa was married in 1927 to Anna Alekseyevna Krylova (1903-1996), daughter of applied mathematician Aleksey Krylov. They had two sons, Sergey and Andrey. Sergey Kapitsa (1928–2012) was a physicist and demographer. Kapitsa was also the host of the popular and long-running Soviet scientific TV show &quot;Evident, but Incredible&quot; and was awarded UNESCO Kalinga Prize for it in 1979. Andrey Kapitsa (1931–2011) was a geographer. He was credited with the discovery and naming of Lake Vostok, the largest subglacial lake in Antarctica, which lies 4,000 meters below the continent&#x27;s ice cap.

Kapitsa had the ear of people high up in the Soviet government, due to the usefulness to industry of his discoveries, regularly writing letters on matters of science policy. In particular, he saved both Vladimir Fock and Lev Landau from Stalin&#x27;s purges of the 1930s, telling Vyacheslav Molotov that Landau was the only one who would be able to solve an important physics puzzle of the time.
Kapitsa died on 8 April 1984 in Moscow at the age 89.

== Honors and awards ==
A minor planet, 3437 Kapitsa, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Karachkina in 1982, is named after him. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1929. In 1958 he was elected a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.

<text>Thomas Tanner (24 January 1674 – 14 December 1735) was an English antiquary and prelate. He was Bishop of St Asaph from 1732 to 1735.

==Life==

Tanner was born at Market Lavington in Wiltshire, and was educated at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, taking holy orders in 1694. The following year, he became chaplain and then fellow of All Souls&#x27;, Oxford, and a few years later private chaplain to John Moore, bishop of Norwich, and afterwards bishop of Ely, who appointed him chancellor of the diocese of Norwich. He lived in Norfolk from 1701 until 1731. In 1706 he became rector of Thorpe, near Norwich, in 1713 a canon of Ely Cathedral, and in 1724 a canon of Christ Church, Oxford.

On 23 January 1732 he was appointed Bishop of St Asaph and thereafter divided his time between London, Oxford and North Wales. He died in Oxford at the age of 61.

==Works==
Tanner&#x27;s chief work published during his lifetime is the &quot;Notitia Monastica&quot;, a short account of all the religious houses in England and Wales. This was published at Oxford in 1695; it was reprinted with additions by the author&#x27;s brother, John Tanner, in 1744; and was reprinted again with further additions by James Nasmith in 1787. He also wrote &quot;Bibliotheca Britannico-Hibernica&quot;, a dictionary of all the authors who flourished in England, Scotland and Ireland before the opening of the 17th century, at which he laboured for forty years. This was eventually completed by David Wilkins and published in 1748, thirteen years after the author&#x27;s death. Tanner also collected materials for a history of Wiltshire and worked for some time on a new edition of the works of John Leland.

==Collections==

When Tanner moved from Norwich to Oxford, his books were conveyed by water but the barge sank at Benson Lock, near Wallingford on 11 December 1731 and they were submerged for twenty hours with lasting effects. Most works were uniformly bound (c.1820) but none of the fly-leaves, possibly annotated by Tanner, survived.

Tanner died in 1735, bequeathing to the Bodleian his English historical papers, 17th century correspondence, manuscripts, and printed books not already held by the library. His collection of books (c.960 volumes) date from the 15th to the 18th centuries and include examples of English 15th and 16th century printing, theological works by Reformers and opponents, and Civil War and Interregnum pamphlets. 

The printed books had been collected for Tanner&#x27;s work on the Bibliotheca, helped by his association with John Moore, the Bishop of Norwich and a book-collector in his own right. His manuscripts, on the other hand, had more diverse origins and contents. Tanner was already interested in autograph letters, but in 1718 bought a significant number of papers held by the historian and pamphleteer John Nalson. Then in 1724 he bought most of Archbishop Sancroft&#x27;s papers, numbering c. 300/467 volumes of Tanner&#x27;s manuscripts. 

Partly thanks to the presence of these Sancroft papers, Tanner&#x27;s collection was quickly made available and used once it had been received by the Bodleian in 1736. In 1738, the manuscripts were ordered and sent out for binding. However, Richard Rawlinson consulted the collection from 1736 to 1739, before any catalogue of Tanner&#x27;s manuscripts had been made publicly available – though Tanner&#x27;s listing of some of the papers came with the collection. Tanner&#x27;s contribution to the Bodleian&#x27;s collection of 20,000 charters and rolls was also one of the most significant. In 1741 Thomas Toynbee (then an undergraduate at Balliol) was paid to catalogue the Tanner manuscripts (later followed by Alfred Hackman in 1860). In August 1744 the first order for one was recorded in the Library&#x27;s entry-books. The printed books were not catalogued at the same rate, and the first order for a Tanner book came from Rawlinson in October 1750, and the first orders designated by shelf-mark date from 1755.

==Family==
Tanner married three times. His first wife, whom he married in 1701, was Rose Moore, eldest daughter of Bishop Moore. She died on 15 March 1706, aged 25 (having had issue Dorothy, died 17 February 1704, aged 14 months), and was buried on the south side of the bishop&#x27;s chapel in Norwich Cathedral, under a white marble tablet with an inscription to her memory. According to Hearne, she was &quot;a short squabb dame&quot;, who was &quot;remarkable for drinking of brandy&quot;, and Tanner after marrying her was obliged to abandon for a time his studies, and was involved in lawsuits about his chancellorship. His second wife was Frances Preston, daughter of Jacob Preston, citizen of London, but of a gentleman&#x27;s family in Norfolk. She died on 11 June 1718, aged 40, and was buried in the same chapel, with an inscription on white marble over her grave. The iron palisade door to this chapel was given by Tanner, and his arms, with those of his first two wives, are on it. Her issue consisted of two daughters, both of whom died young, and one son, Thomas Tanner, canon of Canterbury and rector of Hadleigh and Monk&#x27;s Eleigh, Suffolk, who married in January 1743 Mary Potter, third daughter of Archbishop Potter, and died on 11 March 1786. When John Loveday visited Tanner in July 1732, his house was kept by his sister, &quot;a widow lady&quot;, but he married in May 1733 as his third wife Elizabeth Scottowe of Thorpe by Norwich. She was an heiress, and married as her second husband Robert Britiffe, recorder of Norwich and M.P. for that city. She died on 1 May 1771, aged 77.

<text>James Harrington (or Harington) (3 January 1611 – 11 September 1677) was an English political theorist of classical republicanism. He is best known for his controversial publication &quot;The Commonwealth of Oceana&quot; (1656). This work was an exposition of an ideal constitution, a utopia, designed to facilitate the development of the English republic established after the regicide, the execution of Charles I in 1649.

==Early life==

Harrington was born in 1611 in Upton, Northamptonshire, the eldest son of Sir Sapcote(s) Harrington of Rand, Lincolnshire who died in 1630, and his first wife Jane Samwell of Upton, daughter of Sir William Samwell. James Harrington was the great-nephew of John Harington, 1st Baron Harington of Exton, who died in 1613. He was for a time a resident, with his father, in the manor house at Milton Malsor, Northamptonshire, which had been bequeathed by Sir William Samwell to his daughter following her marriage. A blue plaque on Milton Malsor Manor marks this.

Holy Cross Church in Milton Malsor contains a monument on the south wall of the chancel to Harrington&#x27;s mother, Dame Jane Harrington. According to the memorial, she died on 30 March 1619, when James was 7 or 8 years old. The memorial reads, in modern English but punctuated as in the original:
&quot;Here under lies the body of Dame Jane, daughter of Sir William Samwell Knight, &amp; late wife to Sir Sapcotes Harington of Milton Knight, by whom he had issue 2 sons &amp; 3 daughters, viz James, William, Jane, Anne &amp; Elizabeth. Which Lady died March 30, 1619&quot;.

When his father died in June 1630, James commissioned a second monument, which can still be seen in the Church of St Oswald at Rand in Lincolnshire. It depicts Sapcotes and his first wife Jane together with their five children.

==Childhood and education==

Knowledge of Harrington&#x27;s childhood and early education is thin, though he clearly spent time both in Milton Malsor and at the family manor in Rand. In 1629 he entered Trinity College, Oxford as a gentleman commoner and left two years later with no degree. His eighteenth-century biographer, John Toland, says that while there one of his tutors was the royalist High Churchman William Chillingworth, which may have been the case before the latter left for the Catholic seminary in Douai in 1630. On 27 October 1631 Harrington entered the Middle Temple.

==Youth==

By this time, Harrington&#x27;s father had died, and his inheritance helped pay his way through several years of continental travel. There is some suggestion that he enlisted in a Dutch militia regiment (apparently seeing no service), before touring the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, France, Switzerland and Italy. He was in Geneva with James Zouche in the summer of 1635 and subsequently travelled to Rome. In the light of this, Toland&#x27;s reference to his visiting the Vatican, where he &quot;refused to kiss the Pope&#x27;s foot&quot;, probably refers to early 1636; meanwhile his visit to Venice helped bolster his knowledge of, and enthusiasm for, the Italian republics. The following decade, including his comings and goings during the Civil Wars, are largely unaccounted for by anything other than unsubstantiated stories, for example that he accompanied Charles I to Scotland in 1639 in connection with the first Bishops&#x27; War. In 1641–42 and in 1645 he provided financial assistance to Parliament, providing loans and perhaps also collecting money on behalf of Parliament in Lincolnshire. Yet, around the same time, he was acting as &#x27;agent&#x27; for Charles Louis, the Prince Elector Palatine, who was nephew of Charles I and whose brother Prince Rupert led the Royalist forces in the English Civil War. Charles Louis and his mother had declared their support for Parliament in 1642.

Harrington&#x27;s apparent political loyalty to Parliament did not interfere with a strong personal devotion to the King. Following the capture of Charles I, Harrington accompanied a &quot;commission&quot; of MPs appointed to accompany Charles in the move from Newcastle to Holdenby House (Holmby), after he had been relinquished by the Scots, who had captured him. Harrington&#x27;s cousin Sir James Harrington was one of the Commissioners, which perhaps explains why the future author of &quot;Oceana&quot; was one of those who accompanied the commissioners as servants &#x27;to wait upon&#x27; the King on the journey. Harrington continued as &#x27;gentleman of the bedchamber&#x27; to the King once they reached Holdenby House, and we see him acting in that capacity through to the end of the year at both Carisbrooke Castle and Hurst Castle. However, while at Hurst Castle Harrington got into a discussion with the Governor and various army officers during which he voiced his support for the King&#x27;s position concerning the Treaty of Newport, resulting in his dismissal.

At least two contemporary accounts have Harrington with Charles on the scaffold, but these do not rise above the level of rumour.

==&quot;Oceana&quot;==

After Charles&#x27; death, Harrington probably devoted his time to the composition of &quot;The Commonwealth of Oceana&quot;. By order of England&#x27;s then Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell, it was seized when passing through the press. Harrington, however, managed to secure the favour of Cromwell&#x27;s favourite daughter, Elizabeth Claypole. The work was restored to him, and appeared in 1656, newly dedicated &quot;to&quot; Cromwell. The views embodied in &quot;Oceana&quot;, particularly those bearing on vote by ballot and rotation of magistrates and legislators, Harrington and others (who in 1659 formed a club called the &quot;Rota&quot;) endeavoured to push practically, but with little success.

===Editorial history===
Harrington&#x27;s manuscripts have vanished; his printed writings consist of &quot;Oceana&quot;, and papers, pamphlets, aphorisms and treatises, many of which are devoted to its defence. The first two editions of &quot;Oceana&quot; are known as the &quot;Chapman&quot; and the &quot;Pakeman&quot;. Their contents are nearly identical. His &quot;Works&quot;, including the Pakeman &quot;Oceana&quot; and a previously unpublished but important manuscript &quot;A System of Politics&quot;, were first edited with a biography by John Toland in 1700. Toland&#x27;s edition, with numerous substantial additions by Thomas Birch, appeared first in London in 1737. An edition not including Birch&#x27;s additions but rather a copy of Henry Neville&#x27;s &quot;Plato&quot; &quot;Redivivus&quot; was published in Dublin in the same year. The 1737 London edition was reprinted in 1747 and 1771. &quot;Oceana&quot; was reprinted in Henry &quot;Morley&#x27;s Universal Library&quot; in 1887; S.B. Liljegren reissued a fastidiously prepared version of the Pakeman edition in 1924.

Harrington&#x27;s modern editor is J. G. A. Pocock. In 1977, he edited a compilation of many of Harrington tracts, with a lengthy historical introduction. According to Pocock, Harrington&#x27;s prose was marred by an undisciplined work habit and a conspicuous &quot;lack of sophistication,&quot; never attaining the level of &quot;a great literary stylist.&quot; For example, as contrasted with Hobbes and Milton, &quot;nowhere&quot; to be found are:
&quot;important shades of meaning...conveyed [through] rhythm, emphasis and punctuation; ...He wrote hastily, in a baroque and periodic style in which he more than once lost his way. He suffered from Latinisms...his notions of how to insert quotations, translations and references in his text were at times productive of confusion.&quot;

By contrast, Rachel Hammersley has argued that Harrington&#x27;s literary approach was specifically designed to serve his political purposes, to persuade his readers to act on his ideas.

==Imprisonment==
Following the Stuart Restoration, on 25 November 1661 Harrington was arrested on a charge of conspiring against the government in the &quot;Bow Street&quot; cabal and, without a formal trial, was thrown into the Tower. There, he was &quot;badly treated&quot;, and in April 1662 a warrant was issued for him to be held in close custody, which led his sisters into obtaining a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. Before it could be executed, however, the authorities rushed him to St Nicholas Island off the coast of Plymouth. His brother and uncle won Harrington&#x27;s release to the fort at Plymouth by posting a £5000 bond. Thereafter, his general state of health quickly deteriorated, perhaps from his ingestion on medical advice of the addictive drug guaiacum.
Harrington&#x27;s mind appeared to be affected. He suffered &quot;intermittent delusions;&quot; one observer judged him &quot;simply mad.&quot; He recovered only slightly, then slipped decidedly downhill. He proceeded to suffer attacks of gout and palsy before falling victim to a paralysing stroke. At some point between 1662 and 1669 he married &quot;a Mrs Dayrell, his &#x27;old sweetheart&#x27;&quot;, the daughter of a Buckinghamshire noble.

Harrington died at Little Ambry, Dean&#x27;s Yard, Westminster. He was buried next to Sir Walter Raleigh in St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster. There is a slate wall memorial to him at St Michael&#x27;s Church, Upton.

[Harrington has often been confused with his cousin Sir James Harrington, 3rd Baronet of Ridlington, MP, a member of the parliamentary commission which tried Charles I, and twice president of Cromwell&#x27;s Council of State. He was subsequently excluded from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act which pardoned many who had taken up arms against the King during the Civil Wars (1642–46).]

<doc id="303657" wikidata="Q5535042" url="?curid=303657" title="Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas">
<text>The Geographers&#x27; A–Z Street Atlas, commonly shortened to A–Z (pronounced &quot;Ay to Zed&quot;), is a title given to any one of a range of atlases of streets in the United Kingdom formerly produced by Geographers&#x27; A–Z Map Company Limited, now published by HarperCollins.

==Dating old maps==

Until relatively recently, maps produced by the Geographers&#x27; (A–Z) Map Company did not include a publication date. It is possible to determine a date range for publication due to the following:
* their first map was published in 1936;
* the only maps produced by them during World War II (1939–1945) were war maps of Europe;
* until his death in 1958, the front cover stated &quot;Produced under the direction of Alexander Gross&quot;;
* until 1962, the publication address was &quot;28 Gray&#x27;s Inn Road, Holborn, London&quot;;
* from 1962 to 1992, the publication address was &quot;Sevenoaks, Kent&quot;;
* in 1972, the company name was changed from &quot;Geographers&#x27; Map Company&quot; to &quot;Geographers&#x27; A–Z Map Company&quot;;
* from 1992 to 2019, the publication address is &quot;Borough Green, Kent&quot;.

===Date codes===
On all A–Z maps, there is a three or four letter code in one of the corners, often the one containing the key. These letters represent numbers, which are the cartographic date, in the form (M)MYY. There was at least one scheme used, and perhaps a second.

In one scheme, the letters JIHGFEDCBA represent the digits 1 to 9 and 0, so that HFD would be 357, indicating a publication date of March 1957. This seems to have been used on all the company&#x27;s folding maps, and possibly also those in book form.

If a second scheme was used, if might have been that of Geographia Map Company, also founded by Alexander Gross. In that case, the letters CUMBERLAND represent the digits 1 to 9 and 0.

==Media appearance==
The &quot;Geographers&#x27; A–Z Street Atlas&quot; and the story of how Phyllis Pearsall came to write the first edition covering London were featured in a 2005 episode of Nicholas Crane&#x27;s &quot;Map Man&quot; TV programme. This revealed that, on all their maps, A–Z print a non-existent trap street so that they can tell if a map has been illegally copied from theirs, a technique used by several publishers of reference works (see fictitious entry).

The story of Pearsall&#x27;s development of the A–Z also inspired the 2014 musical &quot;The A–Z of Mrs P&quot;. It reignited a controversy about the extent of her role in the early years of the Geographers&#x27; Map Company.

The London A–Z is a plot device in &quot;The Blind Banker&quot;, the second episode of the first series of the BBC drama &quot;Sherlock&quot; when the protagonist is attempting to decipher a book code used by an international smuggling ring based on a book &quot;everybody owns&quot;. After attempting to decipher the code using a dictionary and the Bible, Sherlock goes out into Baker Street and appropriates a copy of the A–Z after seeing it being used by a couple of tourists.

<text>Peripheral Interchange Program (PIP) was a utility to transfer files on and between devices on Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s computers. It was first implemented on the PDP-6 architecture by Harrison &quot;Dit&quot; Morse early in the 1960s. It was subsequently implemented for DEC&#x27;s operating systems for PDP-10, PDP-11, and PDP-8 architectures.
In the 1970s and 1980s Digital Research implemented PIP on CP/M and MP/M.

==History==
It is said that during development it was named ATLATL, which is an acronym for &quot;Anything, Lord to Anything, Lord.&quot; This humorously described both its purpose as a device-independent file copying tool and the difficulties at the time of safely copying files between devices.

The original PIP syntax was

 PIP destination←source /switches

using the left-arrow character from the ASCII-1963 character set that the Flexowriter keyboards of the time used. As other terminals were introduced that used later versions of ASCII (without the left-arrow character), PIP allowed the syntax

 PIP destination=source

The underscore (_) character, which was in the same ASCII character position that left-arrow had occupied, was still supported to separate the destination and source specifications.

Source and destination were &quot;file specification&quot; strings. These consisted of a device name, typically 2 characters for device type such as DK (disk), LP (line printer), MT (magnetic tape), etc. and a unit number from 0 to 7, a colon (:), filename and extension.

Copying was generally permitted between any file specification to any other where it made sense.

Early versions of VAX/VMS implemented certain DCL commands, such as DIRECTORY and RENAME, by running RSX-11M PIP in compatibility mode. This usage of PIP was replaced by VAX-specific code in VAX/VMS 2.0, but PIP remained as part of the VAX-11 RSX layered product for VMS.

As late as the mid-1980s, PIP was still in common use on TOPS-10, TOPS-20 and PDP-11 systems.

==PIP in CP/M and MP/M==
Gary Kildall, who developed CP/M and MP/M, based much of the design of its file structure and command processor on operating systems from Digital Equipment, such as RSTS/E for the PDP-11. Besides accessing files on a floppy disk, the PIP command in CP/M could also transfer data to and from the following &quot;special files&quot;:
* — console (input and output)
* — an auxiliary device. In CP/M 1 and 2, PIP used (paper tape punch) and (paper tape reader) instead of 
* — list output device, usually the printer
* — as , but lines were numbered, tabs expanded and form feeds added every 60 lines
* — null device, akin to \Device\Null and /dev/null
* — input device that produced end-of-file characters, ASCII 
* — custom input device, by default the same as 
* — punch card unit:
* — custom output device, by default the same as 

These were not true device files, however, because their handling was limited to PIP. The two custom devices and were implemented as calls to fixed locations at the start of the PIP program; the intention was that the user, or the OEM, could patch these locations to add their own input or output devices. 246 bytes of free space were left in the program for this purpose.

In addition to the usual codice_1 syntax, PIP under CP/M still allowed the old codice_2 form. This behaviour was not documented, and CP/M generally did not have a standard for which characters could appear in file names; therefore other programs could and did create filenames containing underscore characters, which PIP could not handle.

==Reserved filenames in Microsoft Windows==
The PIP program is the reason for reserved filenames in Microsoft Windows: codice_3 codice_4 codice_5 codice_6 codice_7 codice_8 codice_9 codice_10 codice_11 codice_12 codice_13 codice_14 codice_15 codice_16 codice_17 codice_18 codice_19 codice_20 codice_21 codice_22 codice_23 codice_24 codice_25 codice_26. This limitation is case-insensitive, and also applies to basenames. So for example, codice_27 is an invalid filename.

<text>William Chillingworth (12 October 160230 January 1644) was a controversial English churchman.

==Early life==
He was born in Oxford, where his father served as mayor; William Laud was his godfather. In June 1618 he became a scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, of which he was made a fellow in June 1628. He gained a reputation as a skilful debater, excelled in mathematics, and also became known as a poet. He associated with Sir Lucius Cary, John Hales, and Gilbert Sheldon.

Interested in religious controversy and not yet in orders, Chillingworth took on the Jesuit John Percy (alias &quot;John Fisher&quot;). Percy succeeded in converting Chillingworth, and persuaded him to go to the Jesuit college at Douai, in 1630. There he wrote an account of his reasons for leaving Protestantism, but kept in touch with Laud. In 1631, however, he thought again, and left Douai. He did not immediately return to the orthodox positions of the Church of England, but was drawn into controversy with Catholics including John Floyd, and in a disputation with Thomas White before Lord Digby and Sir Kenelm Digby.

== Theology ==
He was substantially influenced by Pyrrhonism, and said to &quot;have delighted in Sextus Empiricus.&quot; His theology was a kind of probabilism based on an ultimate Pyrrhonism.

His theological sensitiveness appears in his refusal of a preferment offered to him in 1635 by Sir Thomas Coventry, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. He was in difficulty about subscribing the Thirty-Nine Articles. As he informed Gilbert Sheldon, then Warden of All Souls College, Oxford, in a letter, he was fully resolved on two points: that to say that the Fourth Commandment is a law of God appertaining to Christians is false and unlawful, and that the damnatory clauses in the Athanasian Creed are false, presumptuous and schismatical. To subscribe, therefore, he felt would be to &quot;subscribe his own damnation.&quot; Chillingworth also adopted Arminian views.

==&quot;The Religion of Protestants&quot;==
His major work was an intervention in another controversy, undertaken in defence of Christopher Potter, Provost of The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, against the Jesuit Edward Knott. Potter had replied in 1633 to Knott&#x27;s &quot;Charity Mistaken&quot; (1630), and Knott retaliated with &quot;Mercy and Truth&quot;, which Chillingworth attempted to answer. Knott brought out a preemptive pamphlet tending to show that Chillingworth was a Socinian. Chillingworth wrote &quot;The Religion of Protestants&quot; while staying at Great Tew, owned by Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland. Laud, now Archbishop of Canterbury, was anxious about Chillingworth&#x27;s reply to Knott, and at his request it was examined by Richard Baily, John Prideaux, and Samuel Fell, and published with their approval in 1637, with the title &quot;The Religion of Protestants a Safe Way to Salvation&quot;.

The main argument is a vindication of the sole authority of the Bible in spiritual matters, and of the free right of the individual conscience to interpret it. In the preface Chillingworth expresses his new view about subscription to the articles. &quot;For the Church of England,&quot; he there says, &quot;I am persuaded that the constant doctrine of it is so pure and orthodox, that whosoever believes it, and lives according to it, undoubtedly he shall be saved, and that there is no error in it which may necessitate or warrant any man to disturb the peace or renounce the communion of it. This, in my opinion, is all intended by subscription.&quot;

==Later life==
In the following year (1638), he was promoted to the chancellorship of the church of Sarum, with the prebend of Brixworth annexed to it. In the First English Civil War, he wrote a criticism of the Scots, and was in the king&#x27;s army at the siege of Gloucester, suggesting a &quot;testudo&quot; for assaulting the town. Shortly afterwards he accompanied Ralph Hopton, general of the king&#x27;s troops in the west, in his march; and, being taken ill at Arundel Castle, he was captured by the parliamentary forces under Sir William Waller. As he was unable to go to London with the garrison, he was conveyed to Chichester, where he died. His last days were harassed by the diatribes of the Puritan preacher, Francis Cheynell. Gerald Aylmer thought the subject was &quot;remarkably ineffective&quot; as an anti-Puritan spokesman and that he died &quot;virtually a martyr&quot; for the established church.

==Works==
Besides his principal work, Chillingworth wrote a number of smaller anti-Jesuit papers published in the posthumous &quot;Additional Discourses&quot; (1687), and nine of his sermons have been preserved. He was a zealous Royalist, asserting that even the unjust and tyrannous violence of princes may not be resisted, although it might be avoided in terms of the instruction, &quot;when they persecute you in one city, flee into another.&quot;

His writings enjoyed a high popularity, particularly towards the end of the seventeenth century, after a popular, condensed edition of &quot;The Religion of Protestants&quot; appeared in 1687, edited by John Patrick. &quot;The Religion of Protestants&quot; is acutely argued, and was commended by John Locke. The charge of Socinianism was frequently brought against Chillingworth, but, as John Tillotson thought, &quot;for no other cause but his worthy and successful attempts to make the Christian religion reasonable.&quot; The gist of his argument is expressed in a single sentence:

:&quot;I am fully assured that God does not, and therefore that men ought not to, require any more of any man than this, to believe the Scripture to be God&#x27;s word, and to endeavour to find the true sense of it, and to live according to it.&quot;

In this way he bypassed the debate on the fundamental articles, a bone of contention between the Catholic and Protestant approaches.

A &quot;Life&quot; by Thomas Birch was prefixed to the 1742 edition of Chillingworth&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot;.

<doc id="303678" wikidata="Q316936" url="?curid=303678" title="Anti-tank warfare">
<text>Anti-tank warfare originated during World War I from the desire to develop technology and tactics to destroy tanks. After the Allies deployed the first tanks in 1916, the German Empire introduced the first anti-tank weapons. The first developed anti-tank weapon was a scaled-up bolt-action rifle, the Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr, that fired a 13.2 mm cartridge with a solid bullet that could penetrate the thin armor used by tanks at that time and destroy the engine or ricochet inside, killing occupants. Because tanks represent an enemy&#x27;s strong force projection on land, military strategists have incorporated anti-tank warfare into the doctrine of nearly every combat service since. The most predominant anti-tank weapons at the start of World War II in 1939 included the tank-mounted gun, anti-tank guns and anti-tank grenades used by the infantry, and ground-attack aircraft.

Anti-tank warfare evolved rapidly during World War II, leading to infantry-portable weapons such as the bazooka, anti-tank combat engineering, specialized anti-tank aircraft and self-propelled anti-tank guns (tank destroyers). Both the Soviet Red Army and the German Army developed methods of combating tank-led offensives, including deployment of static anti-tank weapons embedded in in-depth defensive positions, protected by anti-tank obstacles and minefields, and supported by mobile anti-tank reserves and by ground-attack aircraft.

Through the Cold War of 1947-1991, the United States, Soviet Union and other countries contemplated the possibility of nuclear warfare. While previous technology had developed to protect the crews of armored vehicles from projectiles and from explosive damage, now the danger of radiation arose. In the NATO countries, little if any development took place on defining a doctrine of how to use armed forces without the use of tactical nuclear weapons. In the Soviet sphere of influence the legacy doctrine of operational maneuver was theoretically examined to understand how a tank-led force could be used even with the threat of limited use of nuclear weapons on prospective European battlefields. The Warsaw Pact arrived at the solution of maneuver warfare while massively increasing the number of anti-tank weapons. To achieve this, Soviet military theorists such as Vasily Sokolovsky (1897–1968) realized that anti-tank weapons had to assume an offensive role rather than the traditionally defensive role used in the Great Patriotic War (1941–1945), becoming more mobile. This led to the development of improved guided anti-tank missiles, though similar design work progressed in Western Europe and the United States.

Both sides in the Cold War also recognized the utility of light anti-tank weapons, and this led to further development of man-portable weapons for use by infantry squads, while heavier missiles were mounted on dedicated missile tank-destroyers, including dedicated anti-tank helicopters, and even heavier guided anti-tank missiles launched from aircraft. Designers also developed new varieties of artillery munitions in the form of top-attack shells, and shells that were used to saturate areas with anti-armor bomblets. Helicopters could be used as well to rapidly deliver scattered anti-tank mines.

Since the end of the Cold War in 1992, new threats to tanks and other armored vehicles have included remotely detonated improvised explosive devices (IEDs) used in asymmetric warfare and weapon systems like the RPG-29 and FGM-148 Javelin, which can defeat reactive armor or shell armor. Both those weapon systems use a tandem warhead where the first stage of the warhead activates the reactive armor, and the second stage defeats the shell armor by means of a high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) shaped charge.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, drones and loitering munitions have attacked and destroyed tanks.

==Tank threat==
Anti-tank warfare evolved as a countermeasure to the threat of the tank&#x27;s appearance on the battlefields of the Western Front of the First World War. The tank had been developed to negate the German system of trenches, and allow a return to maneuver against enemy&#x27;s flanks and to attack the rear with cavalry.
The use of the tank was mainly based on the assumption that, once they were able to eliminate the German trench lines with their machine gun and infantry support gun positions, the Allied infantry would follow and secure the breach, and the cavalry would exploit the breach in the trench lines by attacking into the depth of German-held territory, eventually capturing the field artillery positions and interdicting logistics and reserves being brought up from the rear areas. Naval crews initially used to operate the installed naval guns and machine guns were replaced with Army personnel who were more aware of the infantry tactics with which the tanks were intended to cooperate. However, there was no means of communication between the tank&#x27;s crew and the accompanying infantry, or between the tanks participating in combat. Radios were not yet portable or robust enough to be mounted in a tank, although Morse Code transmitters were installed in some Mark IVs at Cambrai as messaging vehicles. Attaching a field telephone to the rear would become a practice only during the next war. With greater use of tanks by both sides it was realized that the accompanying infantry could be forced to ground by ambush fire, thus separating them from the tanks, which would continue to advance, eventually finding themselves exposed to close-assaults by German infantry and sappers.

The early tanks were mechanically rudimentary. The thick armor generally prevented penetration by small arms fire and shell fragments. However, even a near miss from field artillery or an impact from a mortar could easily disable or destroy the tank: if the fuel tank was ruptured, it could incinerate the tank&#x27;s crew. A large caliber gun was recognized as a tactical necessity to attack machine gun positions and defeat any infantry field pieces found in the trench lines which could easily disable tank track with the HE ammunition. This was achieved by mounting a 57 mm QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss light naval gun in the hull barbettes. Hull and track engineering was largely dictated by the terrain—the need to cross wide trenches—although the relationship between ground pressure and soil-vehicle mechanics was not resolved until the Second World War. Turrets were later introduced on medium and light tanks to react to ambushes during the advance.

==First World War==
The tank, when it appeared on the Western Front in September 1916, was a surprise to German troops, but not the German General Staff. The French Army Staff was highly critical of the British Army&#x27;s early fielding of the Mark I vehicles in small numbers because the French trials showed the armored vehicles to be highly unreliable. They judged that large numbers had to be employed to sustain an offensive despite losses to mechanical failure or vehicles foundering in intractable no man&#x27;s land terrain. These losses, coupled with those from enemy artillery fire, later amounted to as high as 70% of the starters during some operations. Deploying small numbers of tanks would therefore cause the Allies to lose the element of surprise, allowing Germans to develop countermeasures.

===Anti-tank weapons===
Because the German Army was the only force in need of anti-tank weapons, they were first to develop a viable technology to combat the armored vehicle. These technologies took three ammunition approaches: use of grenades by infantrymen, including the &quot;Geballte Ladung&quot; (&quot;Bundled Charge&quot;) of several stick grenades bound together by pioneers; early attempts at the small-caliber anti-tank rifles like the bolt-action 13 mm Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr; 3.7 cm TaK Rheinmetall in starrer Räder-lafette 1916 anti-tank gun on a light carriage which could destroy a tank using large-caliber armor-piercing ammunition issued in 1917 to special commands; and the existing 77 mm field guns (such as the 7.7 cm FK 16) of the infantry division&#x27;s artillery regiment were also eventually issued with special armor-piercing (AP) ammunition.

===Anti-tank tactics===
With the appearance of Allied tanks, the German Army were quick to introduce new anti-tank defense detachments within the pioneer battalions of the infantry divisions. These were initially issued 13 mm caliber long barrel rifles firing solid shot. However, these suffered from fouling after 2–3 rounds and had a recoil that was unsustainable by the mechanism or the rifleman. Stick grenades were used to destroy the tracks by individual pioneers, however this required accompanying machine-gunners to first separate the supporting Allied infantry line from the tanks, which proved difficult. Another tactic was to lure the tank beyond the German trench-line, re-establishing it just as the Allied infantry approached. The tank would then be engaged by the divisional 7.7 cm guns brought forward, that would try to disable the tracks with ordinary HE shells (and later AP ammunition). If the crews of the disabled tanks refused to surrender, they were engaged with flamethrowers, or a mortar would be fired on the stricken vehicle until a direct hit was achieved on the top surface, usually resulting in an internal fire. Finally, anti-tank obstacles were prepared on the likely approaches by deepening and widening existing ground cratering, the precursors of the anti-tank trench. Finally in early 1917 the 3.7 cm &quot;TaK&quot; from Rheinmetall was rushed to the frontline, and proved effective in destroying the tanks despite limited elevation and traverse.

==Development between the world wars==

Lack of consensus on the design and use of the tank after the First World War also influenced the development of its anti-tank countermeasures. However, because Germany was restricted by the Treaty of Versailles in its military capability, and there were no other challenges to France and Britain, very little development took place in anti-tank warfare until the 1930s.
The Interwar period was dominated by the strategic thinking with fortified borders at its core. These included obstacles consisting of natural features such as ditches, streams and urban areas, or constructed obstacles such as anti-tank ditches, minefields, dragon&#x27;s teeth, or log barriers. The pinnacle of this strategic thinking was considered to be the Maginot Line which replaced infantry-filled trenches with artillery-filled bunkers, including casemates housing 37 or 47 mm anti-tank guns, and steel turrets armed with a pair of machine guns and a 25 mm anti-tank gun, although Germany was forbidden to produce tanks. The construction was partially based on the Allied experience with the Hindenburg Line which was breached with tank support during the battles of Cambrai and St. Quentin Canal, although German Command was more impressed by the surprise achieved by the Canadian troops at the Battle of the Canal du Nord. This came to influence their planning in 1940.

The Maginot line defenses – up to deep from the forward positions to the rear line – were intended to prevent a surprise attack and delay any attack while the French Army was mobilized. With the relative numerical inferiority between the France and Germany, it was a more effective use of manpower. Within the line, passive anti-tank obstacles were supported by anti-infantry and anti-tank bunkers. After Belgium declared neutrality in 1936, France began work on extending the line along the Belgian border.

Improved artillery was seen as the quickest solution to anti-tank defense, and one of the earliest post-war anti-tank gun designs was the 25 mm Hotchkiss model from France. It was intended to replace an Atelier de Puteaux 37 mm weapon designed in 1916 to destroy machine gun positions. Rheinmetall commenced design of a 37 mm anti-tank gun in 1924 and the first guns were produced in 1928 as 3.7 cm Pak L/45, later adopted in Wehrmacht service as 3.7 cm Pak 36. It made an appearance during the Spanish Civil War, as did the Bofors 37 mm developed in Sweden, and used by many early Second World War combatants. The British Army accepted for service the (40 mm) Ordnance QF 2 pounder, which was developed as a tank gun. The Soviet Red Army after the Russian Civil War also begun a search for an anti-tank gun with a French Hotchkiss 37 mm L.33 tank gun, but soon upgraded this to a higher velocity L.45 Model 1935 while also making a licensed copy of the German 3.7 cm PaK 36. However, the Red Army was almost immediately taught a lesson about anti-tank warfare when a tank battalion sent to aid the Spanish Republicans in the Spanish Civil War was almost entirely destroyed in an engagement.

At this time, the predominant ammunition used against tanks was the armor-piercing kinetic energy shell that defeated armor by direct pressure, spiking or punching through it. During the late 1930s shaped charge ammunition was experimented with that used chemical energy for armor penetration. The shaped charge concept is officially known as the &quot;Munroe Effect&quot; and was discovered by accident decades earlier by Professor Charles E. Munroe at the U.S. Torpedo Station, Providence, RI. Professor Munroe was detonating different manufactured blocks of explosives on a sheet of armor plating and observed the blocks having the manufacturing letters recessed (vs. raised) cut an imprint of the manufacturing letters into the armor plate—the birth of the shaped-charged explosive which focuses the blast energy caused by an indentation on the surface area of an explosive. Although shaped charges are somewhat more difficult to manufacture, the advantage is that the projectile does not require as high velocity as typical kinetic energy shells, yet on impact it creates a high-velocity jet of metal flowing like a liquid due to the immense pressure (though x-ray diffraction has shown the metal stays solid) which hydrodynamically penetrates the armor and kills occupants inside. The depth of the penetration, though proportional to the length of the jet and the square root of its density, is also dependent on the strength of the armor. With the development of this new ammunition begun more advanced research into steel manufacturing, and development of spaced armor that caused &quot;jet waver&quot; by detonating prematurely or at the wrong angle to the surface of the main armor.

The only significant attempt to experiment in the use of tanks in the late 1920s was that of the British Army&#x27;s Experimental Mechanized Force that influenced future development of tanks, armored troops and entire armies of both its future enemies and allies in the next war.

In Spain, the anti-tank defense of the Nationalists was organized by the Wehrmacht officers, and the anti-tank guns were incorporated into a system of obstacles that were constructed with the intent to stop an attack by tanks by slowing it down, separating them from supporting infantry (advancing on foot) with machine-gun and mortar fire, and forcing tanks to conduct deliberate head-on assaults with engineer support, or seek a less-defended area to attack. Minefields laid with purpose-designed mines were used for the first time, destroying tank tracks, and forcing combat engineers to clear them on foot. Delay meant that Nationalist field artillery could engage the lightly armored Soviet tanks. This meant a change in Republican operational and eventually strategic planning, and a more protracted combat operations, with more casualties at a greater cost.

The only change to the German anti-tank tactics of the First World War was that now an effective anti-tank weapon was available to support the defending infantry. However, the Soviet tanks armed with 45 mm guns easily destroyed the German light tanks.

Ironically, in the early 1930s until the Spanish War, German officers were conducting secret testing of a new way of employing tanks, infantry and artillery offensively in the Soviet Union with the cooperation of the Red Army. In Germany, these developments eventually culminated in tactics that later came to be known as Blitzkrieg, while in the Soviet Union they formed the core of the deep battle operational doctrine. The successful test of the latter was during the Battles of Khalkhin Gol although the Red Army foundered on the Mannerheim Line in 1940, largely due to the purge in the Officer Corps, claiming many of the senior proponents of the new doctrine. Anti-tank artillery would be included in mobile tank-led Wehrmacht and Red Army units due to the possibility of encountering enemy tanks in a meeting engagement.

The new doctrines of using the tank, were divided into infantry and cavalry schools of thought. The former regarded the tank as a mobile artillery system to be used for infantry support. This suggested that the infantry needed to be armed with integral anti-tank weapons. The latter advocated use of tanks in the traditional cavalry way of high-tempo attacks intended to outflank the enemy infantry and sever its communication lines. This approach suggested that the tank was the best anti-tank system, and only limited anti-tank troops were required to accompany them. For this reason the late 30s tank configurations came in a great diversity, ranging from light tankettes and cavalry tanks to multi-turreted heavy tanks resembling bunkers, all of which had to be considered in training by the anti-tank artillery troops. The development of these doctrines was the most significant influence on the rapid development in anti-tank technology and tactics in the Second World War.

==Second World War==
Two aspects of how the Second World War commenced helped to delay development of anti-tank warfare: resignation and surprise. After Poland was attacked, its allies in the West were resigned to its defeat by a numerically superior Wehrmacht. The little information that was brought out about the conduct of combat during that campaign did nothing to convince either France, Britain or the USSR of the need for improved anti-tank technology and tactics. The reliance on the Maginot Line, and the subsequent surprise of the German offensive left no time to develop existing abilities and tactics in the West. The British were preparing the stop lines and the anti-tank islands to slow enemy progress and restrict the route of an attack. The Red Army however was fortunate in having several excellent designs for anti-tank warfare that were either in final stages of development for production, or had been rejected earlier as unnecessary and could now be rushed into production. The relative ease with which the older models of Red Army&#x27;s tank fleet were destroyed by German anti-tank weapons, using tactics already seen in Spain, once and for all focused Stavka attention on anti-tank warfare as Soviet armies were repeatedly encircled by panzer-led strategic pincer maneuvers. Of the major iconic Soviet weapons of the Second World War, two were made exclusively for anti-tank warfare, the T-34 and the Ilyushin Il-2 &quot;Shturmovik&quot;. The former was one of the most manufactured tanks in history, and the latter, itself dubbed the &#x27;flying tank&#x27;, was one of the most manufactured aircraft. The war also saw the creation and almost immediate abandonment of the self-propelled tank destroyer which would be replaced post war by the anti tank guided missile.

===Aircraft===

As tanks were rarely used in conflicts between the two World Wars, no specific aircraft or tactics were developed to combat them from the air. One solution adopted by almost all European air forces was to use bomb loads for conventional bombers that were composed from small bombs allowing a higher density during bombing. This created a greater chance of causing a direct impact on the thinner top armor of the tank while also having the ability to damage track and wheels through proximity detonation.

The first aircraft able to engage tanks was the Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; using dive bombing to place the bomb close to the target. Some French and German fighters fitted with 20 mm cannon were also able to engage thinner top armor surfaces of the tanks early in the war. The Stuka was also given cannons for anti-armor role though it was obsolete by 1942, and was joined by the Henschel Hs 129 that mounted a podded MK 101 cannon beneath its fuselage, while the Red Army Air Force fielded the Soviet Ilyushin Il-2 armed with a pair of 23 mm cannons and unguided rockets, but armored to enable the pilots to approach German tanks at very low altitude, ignoring small arms, machine-gun and even small anti-aircraft cannon fire that usually provided tanks with protection against the bombers. Il-2s could also carry large numbers of 2.5 kg shaped-charge anti-tank PTAB bombs.

To give it more firepower against tanks, the RAF mounted two underwing pod-mounted 40 mm Vickers S cannon on the Hawker Hurricane (as the Mk. IID), which saw service in North Africa in 1942 and the Hawker Typhoon was given HE rockets though these were more effective against other ground vehicles. From March 1943 the Red Army Air Force produced the more agile Yakovlev Yak-9T (37 mm cannon) and K (45 mm cannon) bomber interceptor also used for ground attack, with one example of either gun in &quot;motornaya pushka&quot; mounts attached to the engine&#x27;s gear reduction unit, that had either one of them firing through a hollow-center propeller shaft.

Following Operation Overlord in 1944, the military version of the slow-flying Piper J-3 Cub high-wing light civilian monoplane, the L-4 Grasshopper, usually used for liaison and artillery-spotting, began to be used in a light anti-armor role by a few U.S. Army artillery spotter units over France; these aircraft were field-outfitted with either two or four bazooka rocket launchers attached to the lift struts, against German armored fighting vehicles. During the summer of 1944, U.S. Army Major Charles Carpenter managed to successfully take on an anti-armor role with his rocket-armed Piper L-4. His L-4, named &quot;Rosie the Rocketeer&quot;, armed with six bazookas, had a notable anti-armor success during an engagement during the Battle of Arracourt on September 20, 1944, knocking out at least four German armored vehicles, as a pioneering example of taking on heavy enemy armor from a lightweight slow-flying aircraft.

===Field artillery===
Field artillery were often the first ground combat arm to engage detected concentration of troops which included tanks through artillery airborne observers, either in assembly areas (for refueling and rearming), during approach marches to the combat zone, or as the tank unit was forming up for the attack. Conventional artillery shells were very effective against the tank&#x27;s thinner top armor if fired in appropriate density while the tanks were concentrated, enabling direct hits by a sufficiently powerful shell. Even a non-penetrating shell could still disable a tank through dynamic shock, internal armor shattering or simply overturning the tank. More importantly the tanks could be disabled due to damage to tracks and wheels, and their supporting vehicles and personnel could be damaged and killed, reducing unit&#x27;s ability to fight in the longer term. Because tanks were usually accompanied by infantry mounted on trucks or half-tracked vehicles that lacked overhead armor, field artillery that fired a mix of ground and air-burst ammunition was likely to inflict heavy casualties on the infantry as well. Field guns, such as the Ordnance QF 25 pounder, were provided with armor-piercing shot for direct engagement of enemy tanks.

===Anti-tank guns ===


Anti-tank guns are guns designed to destroy armored vehicles from defensive positions. In order to penetrate vehicle armor, they fire smaller caliber shells from longer-barreled guns to achieve higher muzzle velocity than field artillery weapons, many of which are howitzers. The higher velocity, flatter trajectory ballistics provide terminal kinetic energy to penetrate the moving/static target&#x27;s armor at a given range and contact&#x27;s angle. Any field artillery cannon with barrel length 15 to 25 times longer than its caliber was able also to fire anti-tank ammunition, such as the Soviet A-19.

Prior to World War II, few anti-tank guns had (or needed) calibers larger than 50 mm. Examples of guns in this class include the German 37 mm, US 37 mm (the largest gun able to be towed by the 1⁄4-ton, 4×4 &#x27;jeep&#x27;), French 25 mm and 47 mm guns, British QF 2-pounder (40 mm), Italian 47 mm and Soviet 45 mm. All of these light weapons could penetrate the thin armor found on most pre-war and early war tanks.
At the start of World War II, many of these weapons were still being used operationally, along with a newer generation of light guns that closely resembled their WWI counterparts. After the well-armoured Soviet T-34 medium and KV heavy tanks were encountered, these guns were recognized as ineffective against sloped armor, with the German lightweight 37 mm gun quickly nicknamed the &quot;tank door knocker&quot; (), for revealing its presence without penetrating the armor.

Germany introduced more powerful anti-tank guns, some which had been in the early stages of development prior to the war. By late 1942, the Germans had an excellent 50-mm high-velocity design, while they faced the QF 6-pounder introduced in the North African Campaign by the British Army, and later adopted by the US Army. By 1943 Wehrmacht was forced to adopt still larger calibers on the Eastern Front, the 75 mm and the famous 88 mm guns. The Red Army used a variety of 45 mm, 57 mm, and 100 mm guns, and deployed general-purpose 76.2 mm and 122-mm guns in the anti-tank role. By the time of the Invasion of Normandy, the British had the calibre QF 17 pounder, which design had begun before the 6 pounder entered service, in general use which proved to be a highly effective anti-tank gun and was also used on the Sherman Firefly tank, the Archer self-propelled gun, and on the 17-pdr SP Achilles

====Tank destroyers====
As towed anti-tank cannon guns grew in size and weight, they became less mobile and more cumbersome to maneuver, and required ever larger gun crews, who often had to wrestle the gun into position while under heavy artillery and/or tank fire. As the war progressed, this disadvantage often resulted in the loss or destruction of both the anti-tank gun and its trained crew. This gave impetus to the development of the self-propelled, lightly armored &quot;tank destroyer&quot; (TD). The tank destroyer was usually based on the hull of existing tank designs, using either a gun integrated into the hull or a fully rotating turret much like that of a conventional tank. These self-propelled (SP) AT guns were first employed as infantry support weapons in place of towed anti-tank guns. Later, due to a shortage of tanks, TDs sometimes replaced the former in offensive armored operations.

Early German-designed tank destroyers, such as the Marder I, employed existing light French or Czech design tank chassis, installing an AT gun as part of an armored, turret-less superstructure. This method reduced both weight and conversion costs. The Soviet Union later adopted this style of self-propelled anti-tank gun or tank destroyer. This type of tank destroyer had the advantage of a reduced silhouette, allowing the crew to more frequently fire from defilade ambush positions. Such designs were easier and faster to manufacture and offered good crew protection, though the lack of a turret limited the gun&#x27;s traverse to a few degrees. This meant that, if the TD became immobilized due to engine failure or track damage, it could not rotate its gun to counter opposing tanks, making it an easy target. This vulnerability was later exploited by opposing tank forces. Late in the war, it was not unusual to find even the largest and most powerful tank destroyer abandoned on the field after a battle, having been immobilized by one high-explosive shell to the track or front drive sprocket.

US Army pre-war infantry support doctrines emphasized the use of tank destroyers with open-top fully rotating turrets, featuring less armor than the standard M4 Sherman tanks, but with more powerful cannon. A 76 mm long-barrel tank cannon was fitted to the Sherman-based M10 GMC and all-new design M18 designs, with the M18 being the fastest-moving American AFV of any type in World War II. Late in 1944, the Sherman-origin M36 appeared, equipped with a 90 mm cannon. With rotating turrets and good combat maneuverability, American TD designs generally worked well, although their light armor was no match for enemy tank cannon fire during one on one confrontations. Another disadvantage proved to be the open, unprotected turret, and casualties from artillery fire soon led to the introduction of folding armor turret covers. Near the war&#x27;s end, a change in official doctrine caused both the self-propelled tank destroyer and the towed anti-tank gun to fall from favor in U.S. service, increasingly replaced by conventional tanks or infantry level anti-tank weapons. Despite this change, the M36 tank destroyer continued in service, and was used in combat as late as the Korean War.

The third, and likely most effective kind of tank destroyer was the unturreted, casemate-style tank destroyer, known by the Jagdpanzer term in German service, or Samokhodnaya Ustanovka in Soviet service for their own designs. These generally featured a heavy gun mounted on an older or then-current tank chassis, with the gun pointing forward with a limited degree of traverse. Casemate tank destroyers often had the same amount of armour as the tanks they were based on. The removal of the turret allowed for greater room to mount a larger gun with a larger breech and leave room for crew. Many casemate tank destroyers either originated as, or were dual-purpose vehicles with the duty of a self-propelled gun, which share many (but usually not all) of the same features and layout. Some examples are the German Sturmgeschütz III – the most-produced German armored fighting vehicle of WW II — and the Soviets&#x27; SU-100, itself based on the T-34 tank&#x27;s hull and drivetrain.

===Infantry===

====Rifles====
Anti-tank rifles were introduced in some armies before the Second World War to provide infantry with a stand-off weapon when confronted with a tank assault. The intention was to preserve the morale of the infantry by providing a weapon that could actually defeat a tank. Anti-tank rifles were developed in several countries during the 1930s. By the beginning of WW2, anti-tank rifle teams could knock out most tanks from a distance of about 500 m, and do so with a weapon that was man-portable and easily concealed. Although the AT rifle performance was negated by the increased armor of medium and heavy tanks by 1942, they remained viable against lighter-armored and unarmored vehicles, and against field fortification embrasures.

Notable examples include the Finnish Lahti L-39 (which was also used as a sniper rifle during the Continuation War), the automatic Japanese Type 97 20 mm anti-tank rifle, the German Panzerbüchse 38, Panzerbüchse 39, the Polish wz.35 and the Soviet 14.5 mm PTRD and PTRS-41.

By 1943, most armies judged anti-tank rifles to lack combat effectiveness due to the diminished ability to penetrate the thicker armor of new tanks –
the British Army had abandoned them by 1942 and the Wehrmacht by 1943, while the US Army never adopted the weapon, although the USMC used Boys anti-tank rifles in the Pacific Theater. However, the anti-tank rifle remained in Soviet use during the conflict due to the importance it occupied in its doctrine of anti-tank in-depth defense, first demonstrated during the defense of Moscow and again during the Kursk battles. This became particularly true later in the war when the Red Army assumed an almost constant offensive, and anti-tank in-depth defensive deployments were used for protecting flanks of the operational breakthroughs against German tactical counterattacks. By firing on the lighter armored infantry and support vehicles (e.g. artillery tractors) the anti-tank rifle units helped to separate the supporting infantry (&quot;panzergrenadiers&quot;) and artillery of the German tanks and so forced the tanks to halt at short distances from the concealed anti-tank guns leaving them exposed to fire from larger, longer ranged anti-tank guns. PTRS-41 semi-automatic anti-tank rifles were also used for sniping since an additional tracer round enabled rapid fire adjustment by the gunner. Although optical sniper scopes were tried with the PTRS-41, the weapons proved too inaccurate at sniping distances (800 m or more), and the recoil too much for effective use of the scopes.

====Rockets and shaped charges====

The development of light, man-portable, anti-tank weapons increased during the Second World War. Most were based on the Munroe effect which led to the development of the high-explosive shaped charge. These weapons were called high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT). The destructive effect relies fully on the kinetic energy of the explosion rather than the ballistic speed of the round on the damage inflicted to the armor. The effect was also concentrated and could penetrate more armor for a given amount of explosives. The first HEAT rounds were rifle grenades, but better delivery systems were soon introduced: the British &quot;PIAT&quot; was propelled in a manner similar to the spigot mortar with a blackpowder charge contained in the tailfin assembly, the US &quot;bazooka&quot; and the German &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; used rockets, and the German &quot;Panzerfaust&quot; was a small recoilless gun. The HEAT warhead was retroactively used to give more power to smaller calibre weapons such as in the conversion of the otherwise limited German 37 mm PaK guns to fire a large shell, called Stielgranate 41, that fitted over the barrel rather than down in it, to a greater range than the &quot;Panzerschreck&quot; could manage.

The Hungarian 44M &quot;Buzogányvető&quot; was a successful unguided rocket used extensively in the Siege of Budapest.

After the war, research on infantry anti-tank weapons continued, with most designers focused on two primary goals: first an anti-tank weapon that could defeat more heavily armored postwar tanks and fighting vehicles, and second a weapon lightweight and portable enough for infantry use.

====Mines and other explosives====


*Though unsophisticated, the satchel charge was an effective anti-tank weapon during World War II; the blast could sever the tracks of a tank, damage internal components or injure the crew.
*Hawkins mine
*The Wehrmacht employed the Goliath tracked mine, an unmanned demolition vehicle.
*The Soviet Union employed anti-tank dogs during World War II, with very limited success; as a counterpart to the German Goliath the Teletank was used as a remote-controlled unmanned tank.
*The Japanese forces employed suicide attacks with pole-mounted anti-tank mines dubbed lunge mines during late World War II. In Vietnam, similar mines were called &quot;bom ba càng&quot; due to the three contact points at the head of each mine.

====Grenades====

Regular fragmentation grenades were ineffective against tanks, so many kinds of anti-tank grenades were developed. These ranged from hollow charge designs (e.g., the British No. 68 AT Grenade), to ones that simply contained a lot of explosive (the British No. 73 Grenade). To increase their effectiveness, some grenades were designed so that they adhered to the tank either through an adhesive (sticky bomb) or with a magnet. The Germans used a magnetic grenade, the Hafthohlladung to ensure that the shaped charge would fire at the optimal 90° angle to the armor.

There was also a special type of grenade called the &quot;Nebelhandgranaten&quot; or &quot;Blendkörper&quot; (&quot;smoke hand grenades&quot;), which was supposed to be smashed over an air vent and fill the tank with smoke, widely used by both sides in World War II. Molotov cocktails also saw much use, especially in the Winter War, early tanks (such as the T-26) being very vulnerable to them, but later tanks required a well-thrown bottle directly over the engine compartment to have any effect at all.

On the whole, thrown anti-tank weapons suffered from a variety of drawbacks. In addition to the inherently short range, they required careful aim to be effective, and those that relied on explosive force were often so powerful that the user had to take cover immediately.

Additionally, with hand-thrown grenades, the requirement for the attacker to get close to the tank made the attacker exceptionally vulnerable to counter-attack from the tank (typically by machine gun), or from infantry – mounted or dismounted troops – accompanying the tank. However, if the attacker were very low to the ground, and in very close proximity to the tank – for instance or less – it might be impossible for the tank crew to see the attacker.

===Tactics===
Anti-tank tactics developed rapidly during the war but along different paths in different armies based on the threats they faced and the technologies they were able to produce. Very little development took place in UK because weapons available in 1940 were judged adequate for engaging Italian and German tanks during most of the North African Campaign. Its experience therefore failed to influence the US Army&#x27;s anti-tank doctrine prior to 1944.
From 1941, German anti-tank tactics developed rapidly as a result of being surprised by the previously unknown Soviet tank designs, forcing introduction of new technologies and new tactics. The Red Army was also faced with a new challenge in anti-tank warfare after losing most of its tank fleet and a considerable part of its anti-tank capable cannons.

Anti-tank tactics during the war were largely integrated with the offensive or defensive posture of the troops being supported, usually infantry. Most anti-tank tactics depend on the range effectiveness of various weapons and weapon systems available. These are divided as follows:
*Operational range over the horizon (20–40 km range)
*:Bomber aircraft and long range artillery
*Tactical staging areas (7–20 km range)
*:Ground attack aircraft and field artillery including MRLs
*Tactical zone forming-up area and rear combat zone (2–7 km range)
*:Heavy anti-tank guns and mortars
*Tactical forward combat zone (1–2 km range)
*:Anti-tank guns and tanks deployed in defense
*Engagement distance (200–1000 m range)
*:Mines and anti-tank rifles
*Close combat distance (25–200 m range)
*:Infantry anti-tank weapons

Ground-to-air cooperation was not yet systematic in any army of the period, but given sufficient warning ground attack aircraft could support ground troops even during an enemy attack in an attempt to interdict the enemy units before they come into tactical combat zone. Various bomb loads can be used depending on what type of tank unit is engaged in at the time or who its accompanying troops are. This is an indirect form of anti-tank warfare where the tanks are denied the opportunity to even reach combat.

Field artillery was particularly effective in firing against tank formations because although they were rarely able to destroy a tank by direct penetration, they would severely crater the area preventing the tanks from moving therefore causing them to become nearly stationary targets for the ground attack aircraft, or disrupting the enemy schedule and allowing own troops more time to prepare their defense.
Anti-tank defense proper was by 1942 designed in First World War fashion with several prepared trench lines incorporating anti-tank weapons of different abilities. Depending on terrain and the available line-of-sight, the longer-ranged guns could begin to fire on approaching tanks from as far as 2 kilometers, which was also the range at which German Panther and Tiger tank gunners were trained to fire. Anti-tank guns were usually deployed to cover terrain more suitable for tanks, and were protected by minefields laid at about 500 meters to 1 kilometer from their positions by combat engineers. In the Red Army the anti-tank rifle units would be positioned throughout the forward trench line and would engage the lighter tanks and any other vehicles, such as infantry half-tracks in an attempt to separate them from the tanks. The anti-tank guns deployed further back would often hold their fire until enemy tanks were within the most effective range for their ammunition. Where there were insufficient anti-tank weapons, engineers would construct anti-tank obstacles such as dragon&#x27;s teeth or czech hedgehog.

Towed anti-tank guns were thought to be the primary means of defeating tanks. At the battle of Kursk for example, the Red Army deployed more artillery regiments than infantry regiments and towed gun densities reached over 20 guns per kilometer of defended tactical zone. A towed gun was much cheaper than a tank and could be concealed in a shallow position. When time allowed, dugouts with strong overhead cover could be constructed. Guns deployed on reverse slopes and in flanking positions could take a toll of attacking tanks. However, gun crews were vulnerable to artillery, mortar HE fire and enemy infantry. Their positions had to be carefully selected and once engaged, they generally could not redeploy. Experience strongly suggested that towed AT guns were less effective than self-propelled AT weapons and took heavier casualties.

The tactic of ambushing enemy armor at grazing shot distances was perfected during World War 2. Some combatants, like the Soviet Red Army, doctrinalized it and used it to engage heavy German armor at optimal distances and angles.

Self-propelled anti-tank guns were rare at the beginning of WW2, although the Belgian Army deployed a few T.15 tank destroyers and the French army was developing several wheeled and tracked designs. The advantages of mobility and even thin armor protection were so compelling that most armies were using self-propelled AT guns by mid-war. Examples of these weapons included the US M10 GMC, German Jagdpanzer IV, and Soviet SU-85.

====Infantry close assault====

The tank is still vulnerable to infantry, especially in close country or built-up areas. Rough terrain may expose the floor armor, and high ground such as multi-story buildings may expose the top armor. Their large size and loud noise can allow enemy infantry to spot, track and evade tanks until an opportunity presents itself for counter-attack.

Because tank crews have limited visibility from inside the tank, infantry can get close to a tank given enough concealment and if the hatches are closed. If tank crewmen unbutton for better visibility they become vulnerable to small arms fire, grenades and molotov cocktails. An infantryman cannot be targeted by a tank&#x27;s main gun when close, as it cannot depress sufficiently. Close defense weapons such as pistol ports, hull-, coaxial- and pintle-mounted machine guns gave them some protection however.

Whilst many hand-held infantry anti-tank weapons will not penetrate the front armor of a tank, they may penetrate the less heavily armored top, rear, and sides. Anti-tank weapons can damage the tracks or running gear to inflict a mobility kill. Early WWII tanks had open vision slits that could be fired through to harm the crew. Later tanks&#x27; slits had thick glass, and sights and periscopes which could still be damaged with powerful small arms such as anti-tank rifles and heavy machine guns, hampering the crew. If all else fails, the hatch could also be forced open and grenades thrown inside, although later tank designs often have hatches designed to be difficult to open from the outside.

Tanks were also vulnerable to hand-placed anti-tank mines. Infantry have even immobilized tanks using a set of plates covered with leaves and dirt as dummy mines – the ruse being augmented by the crew&#x27;s obscured vision – infantry can then attack the stopped tank. This tactic was taught to the British Home Guard during World War II since they were not often provided with long-range anti-tank weapons.

In some cases in World War II, a tactic of some infantry was to run directly up to a tank, avoiding its main and machine guns, and pour petrol over and into the tank and light it, sometimes blocking the exit, burning the crew alive.

In the Japanese army, the use of satchel charges and pole charges was widespread. Although the charges could knock out any allied tank, the tactic was extremely close-range and the sappers were vulnerable to allied weapons.

====Suicide bombing====

Chinese troops in the Second Sino-Japanese War used suicide bombing against Japanese tanks. Chinese troops strapped explosives like grenade packs or dynamite to their bodies and threw themselves under Japanese tanks to blow them up. This tactic was used during the Battle of Shanghai, where a Chinese suicide bomber stopped a Japanese tank column by exploding himself beneath the lead tank, and at the Battle of Taierzhuang where dynamite and grenades were strapped on by Chinese troops who rushed at Japanese tanks and blew themselves up. During one incident at Taierzhuang, Chinese suicide bombers obliterated four Japanese tanks with grenade bundles.

North Korean tanks were attacked by South Koreans with suicide tactics during the North Korean invasion of the South.

American tanks at Seoul were attacked by North Korean suicide squads, who used satchel charges. A North Korean soldier who exploded an American tank with a suicide bomb named Li Su-Bok is hailed as a hero in North Korean propaganda.

During the Iran–Iraq War, the Iranian Mohammad Hossein Fahmideh blew himself up under an Iraqi tank with a grenade.

According to the Sudanese writer Mansour Al-Hadj, Sudanese jihadists were trained to attack enemy tanks by suicide bombing them.

==Korean War==
The initial assault by North Korean KPA forces during the Korean War was aided by the use of Soviet T-34-85 tanks. A North Korean tank corps equipped with about 120 T-34s spearheaded the invasion. These drove against a ROK Army with few anti-tank weapons adequate to deal with the Soviet T-34s. The North Korean tanks had a good deal of early successes against South Korean infantry, elements of the 24th Infantry Division, and the United States built M24 Chaffee light tanks that they encountered. For the UN forces, aerial interdiction by ground attack aircraft was the only means of slowing the advancing North Korean armor. The tide turned in favour of the United Nations forces in August 1950 when the North Koreans suffered major tank losses during a series of battles in which the UN forces brought heavier equipment to develop an anti-tank role, including U.S. M4A3 Sherman medium tanks backed by M26 Pershing and M46 Patton heavy tanks, along with British Centurion, Churchill, and Cromwell tanks.

In the U.S., the M9A1 bazooka rocket launcher evolved into the more powerful M20 &quot;Super Bazooka&quot;, which was used to good effect against North Korean armored spearheads during the Korean War. However, the M20 proved difficult and cumbersome to portage on foot over long distances. The Anti-Tank Aircraft Rocket, developed by the navy, also proved effective against North Korean tanks.

==Cold War==
In the Cold War era, HEAT became an almost universal choice outside of artillery and tank units. The British had developed the High-explosive squash head (HESH) warhead as a weapon for attacking fortifications during the war, and found it surprisingly effective against tanks. Although these systems allowed infantry to take on even the largest tanks, and, like HEAT, its effectiveness was independent of range, infantry typically operated at short range. A major influence in anti-tank warfare came with the development and evolution of anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) that could be fired by infantry operators, from ground vehicles and by aircraft. Increasing use of combined arms tactics allowed the attacking infantry to suppress the anti-tank crews effectively, meaning that they could typically get off only one or two shots before being countered or forced to move.

===Aircraft===
==== Fixed-Wing ====

Cold War aircraft, such as the A-10 Thunderbolt II and SU-25 Frogfoot, have been specifically built for close air support, including tank destruction. They can use a variety of weaponry, including large-caliber anti-tank autocannons or rotary autocannons, air-to-surface missiles (e.g. AGM-65 Maverick), volleys of unguided rockets, and various bombs (unguided or laser-guided and with or without submunitions such as HEAT bomblets, an example of which would be the CBU-100 Cluster Bomb).

==== Helicopter ====
Guided anti-tank missiles were first used in a helicopter-borne role by the French in the late 1950s, when they mounted SS.11 wire-guided missiles on Alouette II helicopters. Initially there were many teething problems; however, the possibilities, such as providing the ability to attack the more lightly armored top of the tank, were clear.

Although putting weapons on helicopters (probably) dates back to 1955 with the Bell 47, the first specific attack helicopter that went into mass production was the Bell AH-1 Cobra in 1966. The AH-1 was equipped with TOW missiles in 1973 for anti-tank ability.

The anti-tank helicopter armed with ATGWs (Anti-Tank Guided Weapons) or anti-tank cannons is one of the biggest threats to a modern tank. The helicopter can position itself where it is not easily seen from a tank and then attack from any quarter, exposing the weaker parts of the tank&#x27;s armor. The limited visibility from a closed-down tank also makes sighting a helicopter harder.

Most helicopter-launched ATGWs have sufficient range that they can under the right conditions be fired at a range too long for the tank to retaliate with its own weapons. This may change with the Israelis fielding the 105 mm and 120 mm LAHAT missiles that can be fired from the main gun of the Merkava MBT. With both anti-tank and anti-helicopter role, it does level the playing field somewhat. The Indian Arjun tank has also been modified to fire this missile. The People&#x27;s Republic of China has developed 100 mm gun-launched missiles based on Russian designs such as the GP2 (based on the Russian Bastion). It has been reported to have successfully engaged aerial targets, and is an anti-tank missile. Similar missiles are available for Chinese tanks equipped with the 105 mm gun. The Russians have also displayed a similar if more advanced system in the Reflex. The system involves an automatic targeting of an aerial/land target instigated by a laser warning system.

===Artillery===
In the last thirty years, however, a variety of artillery projectiles have been developed specifically to attack tanks. These include laser-guided projectiles, such as the US&#x27;s Copperhead Cannon Launched Guided Projectile (CLGP), which increases the chances of a direct hit. Some of these CLGPs (including the Copperhead) have HEAT warheads instead of common HE.

Guided and unguided scatter munitions and submunitions have also been developed: one artillery shell containing several smaller munitions designed to attack a tank. A six-gun battery might be able to fire several hundred submunitions in a minute or two.

In one form, a shell bursts in the air above one or more tanks and several shaped charge (HEAT) or high-explosive dual-purpose (HEDP) bomblets or grenades rain down. Any that hit a tank have a good chance to cause damage, since they are striking thin top armor.

Another form scatters a number of small anti-tank mines in a tank&#x27;s path, which probably will not penetrate the armor but can damage a track, leaving the tank immobile and vulnerable.

More sophisticated are submunitions with a homing ability. Once again the shell explodes above the tank position and dispenses several submunitions. The munitions contain some circuitry to identify tanks, such as IR or millimeter radar. When a tank is identified, a rocket propellant is fired to shoot the projectile at the tank. These munitions will often descend by parachute, to allow time for target acquisition and attack.

All of the above, but the CLGP can be fired from medium (105 mm, 120 mm, and 125 mm) tank guns and medium (122 mm, 130 mm, 152 mm, and 155 mm) tube artillery. There has also been development of medium and large (81 mm, 82 mm, and 120 mm) guided mortar munitions with both internal (e.g., IR or radar) or external (i.e., laser designator) guidance.

===Missiles===

The development of the wire-guided missile, or Anti-Tank Guided Weapon (ATGW) systems came into use in the late 1950s and 1960s that could defeat any known tank at ranges beyond that of the guns of the accompanying infantry. The United Kingdom, France, and other NATO countries were among the first to develop such weapons (e.g., the Malkara missile by the United Kingdom and Australia in 1958). The Soviet Union, and now Russia, put extensive development into these weapons; the first man-portable model to enter service was the AT-3 in 1961. The United States was one of the last, coming up with the BGM-71 TOW in 1970.

For a time, it appeared that the tank was a dead end. A small team of infantry with a few missiles in a well-concealed position could take on a number of the largest and most expensive tanks. In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Soviet first-generation wire-guided missiles employed by the Egyptian forces inflicted heavy casualties on Israeli tank units, causing a major crisis of confidence for tank designers.

Active protection systems, such as the Russian Arena active protection system, are starting to be more common, with similar systems such as the Israeli Iron Fist active protection system. The tank may be on a comeback because of active defense systems, which intercepts incoming projectiles in mid-air. This may allow the tank to be competitive on the battlefield once again.

===Guns===
Anti-tank guns continued to be used in a number of conflicts past World War 2 around the world, such as the Six-Day War and the South African Border War. Soviet anti-tank guns in particular were exported to at least eighteen other countries after being retired from service and have continued to see action.

Rather than developing specialized anti-tank artillery, some nations, including South Africa and Israel, grafted obsolete tank guns onto towed carriages for use in that role.

===Mines===
Owing to greater sophistication of the tank, and engineering support available to tank units to detect and negate minefields, a considerable effort was made to develop more effective anti-tank mine technology in the effort to deny tank-led formations maneuver space, or channel their movement into unsuitable avenues of approach.

===Infantry===

The search for a more suitable, longer-range delivery system took up much of the immediate post-war era. The US invested in the recoilless rifle, delivering a widely used 75 mm design, and less common 90 mm and 106 mm designs (the latter was usually mounted rather than infantry-handled). The 106 mm formed the basis of a dedicated anti-tank vehicle, the Ontos tank, which mounted six 106 mm rifles. The Australian Army also fitted M40 recoilless rifles to Land Rover Series 2 vehicles for use in an anti-tank role. The Soviet Union also built recoilless rifles in various calibers intended to be used as anti-tank weapons, most commonly 73 mm, 82 mm, and 110 mm (only the 73 mm remains in service with the Russian military today, though the other two can be found all over the world due to Soviet military aid during the Cold War). The British used a design to equip infantry units, the BAT series, which served from the 1950s until replaced by MILAN, but it was generally too heavy for infantry use and had to be towed by, or mounted on, a vehicle for maneuverability.

The Soviets developed the RPG-2 from the German &quot;Panzerfaust 150&quot;. Further development led to the ubiquitous RPG-7. The RPG-7 is one of the most widely used anti-tank weapons, favored most by soldiers of irregular militaries. The RPG-7 could fire a range of different warheads, from thermobaric warheads to one HEAT or tandem-charge HEAT warheads against explosive reactive armor equipped tanks. The RPG-7 has a long combat history, and has been used in most wars from the Vietnam War all the way to present day wars. In modern times, the RPG-7 is generally used in an urban environment, which would enhance their effectiveness due to the close ranges involved. However, the aging RPG-7 has evolved to the even more potent RPG-29 which has proven its worth in conflicts in the Middle East, damaging the Merkava IV, Challenger 2 and M1 Abrams main battle tanks.

In the 1960s, the U.S. Army adopted the M72 LAW rocket, a lightweight, collapsible rocket launcher with the ability to penetrate moderate thicknesses of enemy armor. During the Vietnam War, the weapon was used primarily against NVA and Viet Cong defensive works and emplacements, as there were few encounters against enemy armor. Overall, the LAW was regarded as a success, though its ignition system frequently suffered from misfires in the heat and humidity of Vietnamese jungles. The LAW has since been replaced by the AT4 (M136).

===Tactics===
Changes in the anti-tank tactics since the Second World War mostly came from the appearance of new technologies, and increased firepower of the infantry mounted on fully armored vehicles. The most profound anti-tank technology has been the guided missile, which when coupled with a helicopter can mean that tanks can be engaged beyond ground line of sight (LOS), and at one of their most vulnerable aspect, the top armor.

==Effectiveness==

The effect of anti-tank warfare is to destroy or damage enemy tanks, or to prevent enemy tanks, and their supporting troops from maneuvering, which is the primary ability of a tank. In the US Army the degree of effect by an anti-tank weapon on a vehicle is referred to as either &quot;mobility kill&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;catastrophic kill&quot;. In a mobility kill (M-kill), the vehicle loses its ability to move, for example, by breaking a tank track or bogey or damaging the engine; the targeted tank is then immobile, but may retain full use of its weapons (large cannon, heavy machine gun and smaller machine guns) and still be able to fight to some extent. However, a mobility-killed tank is a relatively vulnerable target to RPG or Molotov cocktail attacks, and it cannot maneuver to better firing positions.

A firepower kill (F-kill) is some loss of the vehicle&#x27;s ability to fire its weapons. For example, a tank may be hit on its main cannon, making the main gun inoperable. M-kills and F-kills may be complete or partial, the latter corresponding to reductions in a target&#x27;s ability to move or fire. A catastrophic kill (K-kill) removes the tank&#x27;s ability to fight completely; this may entail complete destruction of the tank or disabling or killing the crew.

===Current trends===
Although the future of the tank was questioned in the 1960s due to the development of the anti-tank missiles, increases in thickness and composition of armor, and other improvements in tank design meant that infantry operated systems were no longer sufficiently effective by the 1970s, and the introduction of Chobham armor by the British Army and reactive armor by the Soviet Army forced the HEAT rounds to be increased in size, rendering them less portable.

Weapon systems like the RPG-29 Vampir and FGM-148 Javelin use a Tandem warhead where the first warhead disables reactive armor, while the second warhead defeats the shell armor by means of a HEAT or a shaped charge. Today the anti-tank role is filled with a variety of weapons, such as portable &quot;top attack&quot; artillery ammunition and missiles, larger HEAT missiles fired from ground vehicles and helicopters, a variety of high velocity autocannon, and ever-larger and heavier tank guns. One of the first lessons of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict is the effectiveness of portable rocket propelled grenades, in particular, Russian-made RPG-29, and Metis-M, Kornet and European MILAN anti-tank missiles.

<doc id="303682" wikidata="Q647105" url="?curid=303682" title="Banshee (character)">
<text>Banshee (Sean Cassidy) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. Created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Werner Roth, the character first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #28 (Jan. 1967).

An Irish mutant, Banshee possesses a &quot;sonic scream&quot;, capable of harming enemies’ auditory systems and causing physical vibrations. He is named after the banshee, a legendary female spirit from Irish mythology, said to possess a haunting cry.

A former Interpol agent and NYPD police officer, Banshee was always a decade older than most of the X-Men and had only a relatively short tenure as a full-time X-Man. He was a mentor of the 1990s-era junior team Generation X.

Caleb Landry Jones portrayed Banshee in 2011&#x27;s &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;.

==Publication history==

Banshee was created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Werner Roth, and first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #28 (Jan. 1967). Thomas originally conceived of the character as a woman, but editor Stan Lee thought that it would not look good for an entire team to gang up on a female villain.

When the character first appeared, he acted as an adversary to the X-Men under coercion, but soon befriended the team and eventually appeared as a member of the X-Men in &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 (May 1975). The character was forced to leave the team when his superpowers were damaged in battle in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #119 (March 1979), and remained an occasional supporting character for the team for several years. Banshee eventually healed fully, and rejoined the team in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #254 (December 1989) for a short stint, later becoming a central figure in the title &quot;Generation X&quot;, which lasted from 1994 to 2001. Banshee was killed in issue #2 of the 2006 &quot;X-Men: Deadly Genesis&quot; limited series.

Banshee was one of the feature characters in the 2011 two-issue limited series &quot;Chaos War: X-Men&quot;. He has since returned to life during the Krakoan Age.

==Fictional character biography==
Sean Cassidy is discovered by the villainous Changeling, who invites him to join Factor Three. Cassidy declines upon learning Factor Three&#x27;s goals. Factor Three, along with the Ogre, captures him and places a headband containing explosives around his head to force him to obey their commands. Codenamed after the banshee, a spirit from Irish mythology, Cassidy is forced to perform various criminal missions for Factor Three. On a mission in New York City, Banshee encounters the X-Men. Professor X uses his telepathy to disarm the headband and remove it, allowing Banshee to help the X-Men defeat Factor Three.

Later, Factor Three captures him again but he helps the X-Men defeat Factor Three&#x27;s ally, the Mutant Master. The Sentinels capture him, but he is released from their captivity. While on the run from the Secret Empire, he fights Captain America and the Falcon, mistaking their then-fugitive status for a link to his pursuers.

Banshee joins the second group of X-Men. After a mission at Krakoa, Banshee remains with the &quot;New X-Men&quot;. Banshee accompanies the team on many different missions and is present for several key moments in the X-Men&#x27;s history, including the first death of an X-Man, Thunderbird. He is also a key player during the first appearance of the Phoenix and the team&#x27;s first encounter with the Shi&#x27;ar. While with the X-Men, he falls in love with Xavier&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, Dr. Moira MacTaggert. Alongside the X-Men, he fights his cousin Black Tom Cassidy and the Juggernaut. Given his age, he frequently acts as a confidant for both Xavier and Cyclops, eventually convincing Cyclops to change his leadership style to better suit the older, more experienced second team of X-Men.

When Banshee loses the use of his powers due to damaged vocal cords, he leaves the X-Men to stay with MacTaggert.

Meanwhile, Black Tom was secretly raising Banshee&#x27;s daughter, Theresa. She develops sonic powers of her own and adopts the name Siryn. Siryn assists Black Tom with his crimes until the pair is defeated by Spider-Woman and the X-Men. While in custody, Tom makes arrangements for Siryn to be reunited with her father.

Banshee&#x27;s powers gradually return as he heals and he remains an ally of the X-Men. He reveals an encounter with Wolverine that occurred before either of them joined the X-Men. Eventually, Sean regains full use of his sonic powers. After the dissolution of the team following a botched mission, Banshee is instrumental in piecing the X-Men back together. When his jaw is broken, he leaves the X-Men again and returns to MacTaggert.

He later becomes the head of the new team of young mutants Generation X along with Emma Frost.

He reappears again as the leader of X-Corps, the new team of apparently reformed mutants criminals.

He dies trying to prevent a plane crash caused by Vulcan.

In his will, Cassidy gives his daughter the family castle—Cassidy Keep—as well as his pipe. When Siryn and Jamie Madrox have a child, they name him Sean in honor of her late father.

Cassidy has been resurrected under the control of villains twice, before being restored to life by a Celestial Death Seed. He is recruited by the Apocalypse Twins as part of their new Horsemen of Death. Following the Apocalypse Twins&#x27; defeat, Banshee is in the X-Men&#x27;s custody and placed in the medical bay of Avengers Mansion. Beast concludes that healing Banshee of the Death Seed energy that made him a Horseman of Death will take years and highly advanced technology.

Sean later resurfaced as part of the Mutant Liberation Front along with Hope Summers. After a confrontation with the X-Men and newest incarnation of the Brotherhood of Mutants, Sean rejoined the X-Men. When attacking the O*N*E headquarters, he was caught with a huge, big weapon like a hulk killer. The machine eventually exploded as X-Men screamed out in sadness as they knew the explosion caused his death.

===House of X===
Sean later appeared alive and completely cured of the Death Seed energy during &quot;House of X&quot;. He later becomes a citizen of Krakoa and is considered to join its group of X-Men, but loses to Polaris.

Some time later, Moira finally revealed herself to Sean in an Irish Pub. She wanted him to help her sneak into Krakoa, but Sean, who still couldn&#x27;t believe she was alive, wanted to take things slow and get her to a hospital first. Losing her patience, Moira decided to cut their reunion short and kill him, ripping his face off to enter the island undercover. Sean was revived by the Five but was deeply troubled by his misfortunes and this was made worse when he was temporarily possessed by &quot;The Skinjacker&quot;, struggling to overcome the treachery of his loved one, he was coerced into making a deal with the mysterious &quot;Mother Righteous&quot; who gave him powers similar to Ghost Rider. After using these new powers to save Nightcrawler, Blindfold and Weaponless Zsen from the astral plane, he was reported by Professor X to have been appearing in the dreams of his closest circle calling himself Vox Ignis, Herald of the Spark. He was later seen observing things with Mother Righteous in the Astral Plane, it was revealed that she had bonded him to the Spirit of Variance a rejected Spirit of Vengeance. After getting them both to thank her for her service, they discussed future plans and she told him to keep an eye on Legion because a new threat was coming.

==Powers and abilities==
Banshee is a mutant whose superhumanly powerful lungs, throat, and vocal cords can produce a sonic scream for various effects, in concert with limited, reflexive psionic powers which directed his sonic vibrations. He can hover or fly at the speed of sound, and can carry at least one passenger. He could overwhelm listeners with deafening noise, stun them with tight-focus low-frequency sonic blasts (effective even against shielded ears by penetrating the skull via bone conduction), plunge them into a hypnotic trance, disorient them, nauseate them, or simply render them unconscious. Using sonic waves, he can rapidly vibrate himself or other masses at will. He could generate sonic blasts which struck with tremendous concussive force, liquefying or outright disintegrating targets at his highest levels of power. By radiating sound waves outward and reading the feedback, he can locate and analyze unseen objects in a sonar-like fashion. By modulating his scream&#x27;s harmonics, he can confuse most scanning equipment. He can instinctively analyze, replicate, and block sonic waves or vibrations from other sources.

Banshee generates a psionic field which protects him from the detrimental effects of his sonic vibrations, though his sonic powers can still injure him when pushed beyond safe limits. For a while, his sonic powers were gone after having to use them up and down the harmonic scale to stop a weapon of Moses Magnum&#x27;s. His physiology seems fully vulnerable to conventional injury when his sonic powers are not engaged. Banshee has selective hearing, enabling him to focus upon, enhance, or totally block out any given sound in his environment; this shields him from the deafening sound of his own screams, and make him a superhumanly acute eavesdropper in surveillance situations. Sean and his cousin Black Tom are immune to each other&#x27;s natural mutant energy powers, though Sean&#x27;s immunity does not extend to the new powers Tom later developed via artificial mutations.

A gifted detective, veteran undercover operative, and formidable unarmed combatant, Cassidy is an excellent marksman and a competent amateur machine-smith, well-versed in combat strategy &amp; tactics, and teamwork drills, from his training at Interpol. An effective educator, organizer, and lobbyist, he is also an avid American country music aficionado and skillful amateur piano player. As Cassidy, he wields conventional firearms, sometimes loaded with explosive &quot;micro-bombs.&quot; As Banshee, he wears synthetic costuming designed to resist air friction, usually including underarm wings that helped him glide on air currents and his own sonic waves. The &quot;ribbons&quot; on Banshee&#x27;s costume (a visual trademark of the character) aid him in his flight.

<text>Cape Agulhas (; , &quot;Cape of Needles&quot;) is a rocky headland in Western Cape, South Africa. It is the geographic southern tip of Africa and the beginning of the traditional dividing line between the Atlantic and Indian oceans according to the International Hydrographic Organization. It is approximately half a degree of latitude, or , farther south than the Cape of Good Hope.

Historically, the cape has been known to sailors as a major hazard on the traditional clipper route. It is sometimes regarded as one of the great capes. It was most commonly known in English as Cape L&#x27;Agulhas until the 20th century. The town of L&#x27;Agulhas is near the cape.

== Geography ==
Cape Agulhas is located in the Overberg region, 170 kilometres (105 mi) southeast of Cape Town. The cape was named by Portuguese navigators, who called it &quot;Cabo das Agulhas&quot;—Portuguese for &quot;Cape of Needles&quot;—after noticing that around the year 1500 the direction of magnetic north (and therefore the compass needle) coincided with true north in the region. The cape is within the Cape Agulhas Local Municipality in the Overberg District of the Western Cape province of South Africa.

South of Cape Agulhas the warm Agulhas Current, that flows south along the east coast of Africa, retroflects back into the Indian Ocean. While retroflecting, it pinches off large ocean eddies (Agulhas rings) that drift into the South Atlantic Ocean and take enormous amounts of heat and salt into the neighbouring ocean. This mechanism constitutes one of the key elements in the global conveyor belt circulation of heat and salt.

Cape Agulhas has a gradually curving coastline with rocky and sand beaches. A survey marker and a new marker depicting the African continent are located at the most Southern tip of Africa. The waters of the Agulhas Bank off the coast are quite shallow and are renowned as one of the best fishing grounds in South Africa.

The rocks that form Cape Agulhas belong to the Table Mountain Group, often loosely termed the Table Mountain sandstone. They are closely linked to the geological formations that are exposed in the spectacular cliffs of Table Mountain, Cape Point and the Cape of Good Hope.
== Climate ==
Cape Agulhas has a warm Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csb&quot;). The climate is consistently mild, with no temperature or rainfall extremes. According to South African National Parks, who administer the nature reserve, the average rainfall is 400–600 mm per annum, mostly received in winter. Temperature climate data is available for Cape Agulhas, averages are:

== Shipping hazards ==

The sea off Cape Agulhas is notorious for winter storms and mammoth rogue waves, which can range up to 30 metres (100 ft) high and can sink even large ships. Over the past few hundred years it has been believed that around 150 ships have sunk around Agulhas. These conditions are caused by a number of factors. The naturally strong winds of the Roaring Forties, which blow from west to east, and the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current flowing in the same direction, come up against the warmer Agulhas Current in the region of the cape. These conflicting currents of water of different densities, and the west winds blowing against the Agulhas Current, can create extremely hazardous wave conditions; these are further exacerbated by the shallow waters of the Agulhas Bank, a broad, shallow part of the continental shelf which just 250 kilometres (155 mi) south from the cape, after which it falls steeply away to the abyssal plain.

These hazards have combined to make the cape notorious among sailors. The coast here is littered with wrecks: &quot;Arniston&quot; (1815), &quot;Geortyrder&quot; (1849), &quot;Elise&quot; (1879), &quot;Cooranga&quot; (1964), &quot;Gwendola&quot; (1968), &quot;Federal Lakes&quot; (1975), and &quot;Gouritz&quot; (1981), but these are just a few of the vessels lost in the proximity of the &quot;Cape of Needles&quot;. Owing to the hazards and following the loss of several vessels, notably the &quot;Arniston&quot;, a lighthouse was built in 1848. The lighthouse now plays host to a museum and a small rustic restaurant.

<text>Jules Michelet (; 21 August 1798 – 9 February 1874) was a French historian and writer. He is best known for his multivolume work, &quot;Histoire de France&quot; (History of France), which is considered a foundational text in modern historiography. Michelet was influenced by Giambattista Vico; he admired Vico&#x27;s emphasis on the role of people and their customs in shaping history, which was a major departure from the then prominent emphasis on political and military leaders. Michelet also drew inspiration from Vico&#x27;s concept of the &quot;&quot;, or the cyclical nature of history, in which societies rise and fall in a recurring pattern.

In , Michelet coined the term Renaissance (meaning &quot;rebirth&quot; in French) as a period in Europe&#x27;s cultural history that reflected a clear break away from the Middle Ages. This subsequently created a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the new, &quot;re-birthed&quot; world. The term &quot;rebirth&quot; and its association with the Renaissance can be traced to a work published in 1550 by the Italian art historian Giorgio Vasari. Vasari used the term to describe the advent of a new manner of painting that began with the work of Giotto, as the &quot;rebirth () of the arts&quot;. Michelet thereby became the first historian to use and define the French translation of the term, &quot;Renaissance,&quot; to identify the period in Europe&#x27;s cultural history that followed the Middle Ages.

Historian François Furet described &quot;Histoire de France&quot; as &quot;the cornerstone of revolutionary historiography&quot; and &quot;a literary monument.&quot;

==Early life==
Michelet&#x27;s father was a master printer, and Jules would assist him with his work. At one point, he was offered a spot at the imperial printing office, but instead chose to attend the famous Collège of Lycée Charlemagne, where he distinguished himself. He passed the university examination in 1821, and was soon appointed to a professorship of history in the Collège Rollin.

In 1824, he married Pauline Rousseau. This period was considered a very favourable time for scholars in France, and Michelet had many powerful patrons including Abel-François Villemain and Victor Cousin, among others. Since childhood, he is said to have embraced republicanism and a peculiar variety of romantic free thought. He was an ardent politician, as well as a man of letters and an inquirer into the history of the past. His earliest works were school textbooks.

Between 1825 and 1827, he produced diverse sketches, chronological tables and other works relating to modern history. His précis of the subject was published in 1827. In the same year, he was appointed &quot;maître de conférences&quot; at the École normale supérieure. Four years later, in 1831, he wrote his .

==Record Office==
The events of the July Revolution of 1830 had placed Michelet in a better position for study than before. He obtained a place in the Record Office and a deputy-professorship under the historian Guizot in the literary faculty of the university. Soon afterward, he began his magnum opus, the , which would take 30 years to complete. He also published numerous other books, chiefly of erudition, such as the , the , the , and somewhat later, the .

In 1838, Michelet&#x27;s studies had fed his natural aversion to the principles of authority and ecclesiasticism. During the revival of Jesuit activity in France he was appointed to the chair of history at the Collège de France. Assisted by his friend Edgar Quinet, he began a violent polemic against the religious order and the principles that it represented. This polemic made the lectures, especially Michelet&#x27;s, among the most popular of the day.

He published &quot;Histoire Romaine&quot; in 1839, the same year his first wife died. The results of his lectures appeared in the volumes &quot;,&quot; and . These books do not display the apocalyptic style (partly borrowed from Lamennais) which characterizes Michelet&#x27;s later works, but they contain many of his core beliefs — a mixture of sentimentalism, communism, and anti-sacerdotalism.

Michelet, along with many others, propagated the principles that led to the outbreaks of 1848: his original lectures were of so incendiary a kind that the course had to be interdicted. When the revolution broke out, instead of attempting to enter active political life, he devoted himself more strenuously to his literary work. Besides continuing the &quot;Histoire de France&quot;, he also wrote during the years between the downfall of Louis Philippe and the final establishment of Napoleon III.

In 1849, at the age of 51, he married his second wife, 23-year-old Athénaïs Michelet (née Mialaret). She was a woman of some literary capacity as a natural history writer and memoirist, and also had republican sympathies. She had been a teacher in Saint Petersburg before their extensive correspondence led to marriage. They entered into a shared literary life and she would end up assisting him significantly in his endeavors. He openly acknowledged this, although she was never given credit in his works.

==Minor works==
After the ascendance of Napoleon III in 1852, Michelet lost his position in the Record Office when he refused to swear fealty to the new emperor. This caused him to become more republican in outlook, helped by his marriage to the republican Athénaïs. While his &quot;Histoire&quot; remained his main pursuit, a crowd of lesser works accompanied and diversified it. Sometimes they were expanded versions of its episodes, what may be called commentaries or companion volumes. 

The first of these was (1854), in which Michelet&#x27;s dithyrambic often gives way to tedious and inconclusive writing. followed and was then succeeded by (1859), one of Michelet&#x27;s most popular books. 

In the next, (1856), Michelet ventured into natural history, a subject new to him, having been introduced to it by Athénaïs. was treated from the point of view of Michelet&#x27;s pantheism, rather than a scientific perspective.

Michelet continued to publish similar works every 12 months for around five to six years: the next was &quot;La Femme&quot; (1860). This was a critique of French literature and character.

Vincent van Gogh notably inscribed a quote he took from &quot;La Femme&quot; on his drawing, &quot;Sorrow&quot;. It reads, &quot;&quot; (&quot;How can there be on earth a woman alone?&quot;).

 followed in 1861, which represented a happier return to natural history. It was written in a lyrical vein and influenced by his wife.

The next year (1862), one of Michelet&#x27;s more successful minor works, &quot;Satanism and Witchcraft&quot;, was published. Developed out of an episode of history, it has strong hints of Michelet&#x27;s more unusual views. It was eventually adapted by animation studio Mushi Production into an animated art film, Belladonna of Sadness, directed by Eiichi Yamamoto.

While Michelet was not yet finished publishing works in this style, the later volumes were less critically acclaimed. The (1864), a historical sketch of religions, was not well received. In (1868), the last of the natural history series, Michelet uses the staccato style, which creates short and disjointed sentences, but creates tension.
 (1869), the last of the smaller books published during Michelet&#x27;s life, is a tractate on education, written with knowledge in a manner that highlights Michelet&#x27;s research capabilities. Contenporary critics disliked the book, saying it highlighted Michelet&#x27;s decreasing capability to express himself. However, in a book published posthumously, , later critics do not mention this. 

 and are two other collections of Michelet&#x27;s pieces that were published at different times. 

Michelet&#x27;s was edited by Émile Faguet in 1890 and a second edition was printed in 1900. The publication of this series of books, and the completion of his history, occupied Michelet during both decades of the empire. During this time he lived partly in France, partly in Italy, and was accustomed to spending the winter on the Riviera, chiefly at Hyères.

In 1867, Michelet completed his magnum opus, the , comprising 19 volumes. The first of these deals with early French history up to the death of Charlemagne; the second with the flourishing time of feudal France; the third with the thirteenth century; the fourth, fifth, and sixth volumes with the Hundred Years&#x27; War; the seventh and eighth with the establishment of the royal power under Charles VII and Louis XI. The 16th and 17th centuries have four volumes apiece, much of which is very distantly connected with French history proper, especially in the two volumes entitled and . The last three volumes carry on the history of the eighteenth century to the outbreak of the Revolution.

Michelet abhorred the Middle Ages and celebrated their end as a radical transformation. He attempted to clarify how a lively Renaissance could originate from an ossified medieval culture.

==Themes==
Michelet had several themes running throughout his works, which included the following three categories: maleficent, beneficent, and paired. Within each of the three themes, there are subsets of ideas that occur throughout Michelet&#x27;s various works. One of these themes was the idea of paired themes; for example, in many of his works he writes on grace and justice, grace being the woman or feminine, and justice being more of a masculine idea. Michelet additionally used union and unity often in his discussions about history, both human and natural. In terms of the maleficent themes, there were subcategories these were: themes of the dry, which included concepts such as: the machine, the Jesuits, scribes, the electric, irony (Goethe), the Scholastics, public safety, and fatalism (Hobbes, Molinos, Spinoza, Hegel). Themes of the empty and the turgid included the Middle Ages, the imitation, tedium, the novel, narcotics, Alexander, and plethoric (engorged blood). Michelet also touches on themes of the indeterminate such as the Honnete-Hommes, Conde&#x27;, Chantilly Sade, gambling, phantasmagoria, Italian comedy, white blood, and sealed blood.

Martial dualism is a prominent theme for him. He wrote, &quot;With the world began a war which will end only with the world: war of man against nature, spirit against matter, liberty against fatality. History is nothing other than the record of this interminable struggle.&quot; Intellectual historian David Nirenberg describes this as a &quot;Manichaean dualism.&quot; His framing of history as a struggle between Christian spirit and liberty against Jewish matter, fatality, and tyranny, is seen by Nirenberg as an example of anti-Judaism as a constituent conceptual tool in western thought.

==Academic reception==
Michelet was perhaps the first historian to devote himself to anything resembling a picturesque history of the Middle Ages and his account is still one of the most vivid that exists. He spent extensive time researching printed authorities and manuscripts for his &quot;Histoire de France&quot;, however his many personal biases (both political and religious) reduced the book&#x27;s objectivity. 

Michelet gave certain parts of history more weight than others, however his insistence that history should concentrate on &quot;the people, and not only its leaders or its institutions&quot;, was unique in historical scholarship at the time.

==Political life==
The fall of Napoleon in 1870 in the midst of France&#x27;s defeat by Prussia, followed by the rise and fall of the Paris Commune the next year, once more stimulated Michelet to activity. While he wrote letters and pamphlets during the struggle, upon its conclusion he became determined to add a 19th volume (French: &quot;XIXe siècle&quot;) to his &quot;Histoires&quot; which covered the Napoleonic Wars. He did not, however, live to carry it further than the Battle of Waterloo, and his health was beginning to fail: he opened the 19th volume with the words &quot;&quot; (&quot;age hurries me&quot;).

The new republic was not altogether a restoration for Michelet; his professorship at the Collège de France, of which he always contended he had been unjustly deprived, was not given back to him.

==Marriages==
As a young man, Michelet married Pauline Rousseau in 1824. She died in 1839. Michelet married his second wife, Athénaïs Michelet, in 1849. His second wife had been a teacher in St. Petersburg and was an author in the field of natural history and memoirs. She had opened a correspondence with him arising from her ardent admiration of his ideas that ensued for years. They became engaged before they had seen each other. After their marriage, she collaborated with him in his labors albeit without formal credit, introduced him to natural history, inspired him on themes, and was preparing a new work, &quot;La nature&quot;, at the time of his death in 1874. She lived until 1899.

==Death and burials==
Upon his death from a heart attack at Hyères on 9 February 1874, Michelet was interred there. At his widow&#x27;s request, a Paris court granted permission for his body to be exhumed on 13 May 1876 so he could be buried in Paris.

On 16 May, his coffin arrived for reburial at Le Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Michelet&#x27;s monument there, designed by architect Jean-Louis Pascal, was erected in 1893 through public subscription.

==Bequeathment of literary rights==
Michelet accorded Athénaïs literary rights to his books and papers before he died, acknowledging the significant role she had in what he published during his later years. After winning a court challenge to this bequeathment, Athénaïs retained the papers and publishing rights. An author of memoirs, she later published several books about her husband and his family that were based on extracts and journals he had left her.

Athénaïs bequeathed that literary legacy to Gabriel Monod, a historian who founded the journal &quot;Revue historique&quot;. A potentially misogynistic effort to discount the contributions of Athénaïs is noted by a historian, Bonnie Smith, who notes, &quot;Michelet scholarship, like other historiographical debates, has taken great pains to establish the priority of the male over the female in writing history.&quot;

<text>Spall are fragments of a material that are broken off a larger solid body. It can be produced by a variety of mechanisms, including as a result of projectile impact, corrosion, weathering, cavitation, or excessive rolling pressure (as in a ball bearing). Spalling and spallation both describe the process of surface failure in which spall is shed.

The terms &quot;spall&quot;, &quot;spalling&quot;, and &quot;spallation&quot; have been adopted by particle physicists; in neutron scattering instruments, neutrons are generated by bombarding a uranium (or other) target with a stream of atoms. The neutrons that are ejected from the target are known as &quot;spall&quot;.

==Mechanical spalling==
Mechanical spalling occurs at high-stress contact points, for example, in a ball bearing. Spalling occurs in preference to brinelling, where the maximal shear stress occurs not at the surface, but just below, shearing the spall off.

One of the simplest forms of mechanical spalling is plate impact, in which two waves of compression are reflected on the free-surfaces of the plates and then interact to generate a region of high tensile stress inside one of the plates.

Spalling can also occur as an effect of cavitation, where fluids are subjected to localized low pressures that cause vapour bubbles to form, typically in pumps, water turbines, vessel propellers, and even piping under some conditions. When such bubbles collapse, a localized high pressure can cause spalling on adjacent surfaces.

===Anti-tank warfare===

In anti-tank warfare, spalling through mechanical stress is an intended effect of high-explosive squash head (HESH) anti-tank shells and many other munitions, which may not be powerful enough to pierce the armour of a target. The relatively soft warhead, containing or made of plastic explosive, flattens against the armour plating on tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs) and explodes, creating a shock wave that travels through the armour as a compression wave and is reflected at the free surface as a tensile wave breaking (tensile stress/strain fracture) the metal on the inside. The resulting spall is dangerous to crew and equipment, and may result in a partial or complete disablement of a vehicle and/or its crew. Many AFVs are equipped with spall liners inside their armour for protection.

A kinetic energy penetrator, if it can defeat the armour, generally causes spalling within the target as well, which helps to destroy or disable the vehicle and its crew.

An early example of anti-tank weapon intentionally designed to cause spallation instead of penetration is the wz. 35 anti-tank rifle.

==Spalling in mechanical weathering==

Spalling is a common mechanism of rock weathering, and occurs at the surface of a rock when there are large shear stresses under the surface. This form of mechanical weathering can be caused by freezing and thawing, unloading, thermal expansion and contraction, or salt deposition.

===Unloading===
Unloading is the release of pressure due to the removal of an overburden. When the pressure is reduced rapidly, the rapid expansion of the rock causes high surface stress and spalling.

===Freeze–thaw weathering===
Freeze–thaw weathering is caused by moisture freezing inside cracks in rock. Upon freezing its volume expands, causing large forces which cracks spall off the outer surface. As this cycle repeats the outer surface repeatedly undergoes spalling, resulting in weathering.

Some stone and masonry surfaces used as building surfaces will absorb moisture at their surface. If exposed to severe freezing conditions, the surface may flake off due to the expansion of the water. This effect can also be seen in terracotta surfaces (even if glazed) if there is an entrance for water at the edges.

===Exfoliation===

Exfoliation (or onion skin weathering) is the gradual removing of spall due to the cyclic increase and decrease in the temperature of the surface layers of the rock. Rocks do not conduct heat well, so when they are exposed to extreme heat, the outermost layer becomes much hotter than the rock underneath causing differential thermal expansion. This differential expansion causes sub-surface shear stress, in turn causing spalling. Extreme temperature change, such as forest fires, can also cause spalling of rock. This mechanism of weathering causes the outer surface of the rock to fall off in thin fragments, sheets or flakes, hence the name exfoliation or onion skin weathering.

===Salt spalling===
Salt spalling is a specific type of weathering which occurs in porous building materials, such as brick, natural stone, tiles and concrete. Dissolved salt is carried through the material in water and crystallizes inside the material near the surface as the water evaporates. As the salt crystals expand this builds up shear stresses which break away spall from the surface.

==Corrosion==
In corrosion, spalling occurs when a substance (metal or concrete) sheds tiny particles of corrosion products as the corrosion reaction progresses. Although they are not soluble or permeable, these corrosion products do not adhere to the parent material&#x27;s surface to form a barrier to further corrosion, as happens in passivation. Spallation happens as the result of a large volume change during the reaction.

In the case of actinide metals (most notably the depleted uranium used in some types of ammunition), the material expands so strongly upon exposure to air that a fine layer of oxide is forcibly expelled from the surface. A slowly oxidised plug of metallic uranium can sometimes resemble an onion subjected to desquamation. The main hazard however arises from the pyrophoric character of actinide metals which can spontaneously ignite when their specific area is high. This property, along with the inherent toxicity and (for some to a lesser extent) radioactivity of these elements, make them dangerous to handle in metallic form under air. Therefore, they are often handled under an inert atmosphere (nitrogen or argon) inside an glovebox.

==Spalling in refractory concrete==
There are two drivers for spalling of concrete: thermal strain caused by rapid heating and internal pressures due to the removal of water. Being able to predict the outcome of different heating rates on thermal stresses and internal pressure during water removal is particularly important to industry and other concrete structures.

Explosive spalling events of refractory concrete can result in serious problems. If an explosive spalling occurs, projectiles of reasonable mass (1–10 kg) can be thrust violently over many metres, which will have safety implications and render the refractory structure unfit for service. Repairs will then be required resulting in significant costs to industry.

<text>Auguste Émile Faguet (; 17 December 18477 June 1916) was a French author and literary critic.

==Biography==
Faguet was born at La Roche-sur-Yon, Vendée, and educated at the École normale supérieure in Paris. After teaching for some time in La Rochelle and Bordeaux, he returned to Paris to act as assistant professor of poetry in the university. Faguet became professor in 1897. He was elected to the Académie française in 1900, and received the ribbon of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in the next year.

Faguet acted as dramatic critic to the &quot;Soleil&quot;; from 1892 he was literary critic to the &quot;Revue Bleue&quot;; and in 1896 took the place of Jules Lemaître on the &quot;Journal des débats&quot;. Faguet died in Paris, aged 68.

<text>Caernarfon Town Football Club () is a professional Welsh football club based in Caernarfon, Gwynedd. They play in the .

They are nicknamed &quot;the Canaries&quot; because of the club&#x27;s yellow and green strip, a nickname that dates from 1895. Caernarfon Town plays at The Oval.

==History==
===Predecessors===
The first football club in Caernarfon, known as Carnarvon Wanderers, was formed in September 1876 and played at various grounds before moving to the Oval in 1888. On 30 October 1886, Wanderers were the first team from north west Wales to enter the FA Cup and lost 10–1 away to Stoke. Five years later, however, that particular club went out of existence but, in 1894, several former players began a new team called Carnarvon Ironopolis. That club competed in the North Wales Coast League, winning the championship on two occasions and reaching the semi-final of the Welsh Cup in 1900 and again in 1902. Unfortunately, following a dispute with the league, Ironopolis folded in 1903. The demise of the club resulted in some of the players forming the Caernarvon Celts while others affiliated to the Caernarvon RWF (Royal Welsh Fusiliers), both clubs playing at the Oval.

In 1906, the clubs amalgamated to form Carnarvon United and in 1909 the new club won both the Welsh and North Wales Amateur Cups. After the Great War, the demobbed United players formed a new club (Caernarvon Athletic) which, until 1921, played in the North Wales Coast League and thereafter the Welsh National League Division Two (West), with mixed fortune. In 1926, however, a limited company was formed and a full-time manager and professional team engaged. The club met with immediate success, winning the Welsh National League Division One championship in 1926–27, ahead of Bangor City and Rhyl, and repeating the feat in 1929–30 having been pipped to the title by Connah&#x27;s Quay &amp; Shotton 12 months earlier. Caernarvon Athletic are still remembered for their FA Cup run in 1929 when they defeated Darlington before going out to Bournemouth &amp; Boscombe Athletic in a second round replay, the first game at the Oval attracting a crowd of some 9,000. In 1930, however, the club went into liquidation but two years later a re-formed team won the Welsh Combination before quitting over problems in using the Oval.

===1937–1988===
In 1937, a group of local football enthusiasts began Caernarfon Town F.C. and entered a team in the Welsh League North Division One. A 39-year unbroken membership of the league was begun and Caernarfon Town won the championship in 1946–47 and 1965–66 and finished runners-up in both 1956–57 and 1957–58 and once again in 1972–73. In 1976 internal problems led to the club&#x27;s withdrawal from the league after just six matches but, within a matter of months, the club was once again re-formed and bounced back 12 months later. Astonishingly, the club then proceeded to win the league championship in each of the next two seasons!

After taking those two league titles in 1977–78 and 1978–79, losing only one game in total (Nantlle Vale winning 1–0 in 1977–78), Caernarfon were granted permission by the Welsh Football Association to join the Lancashire Combination league. The club went on to win the Combination Cup in 1981 (beating Bacup Borough in the two-legged final) and then the league championship in 1981–82, heading off the challenge of Colne Dynamoes by two points.

The following season, Caernarfon moved into the newly created North West Counties League and achieved promotion, along with Radcliffe Borough, at the first attempt. In 1985, Caernarfon Town were runners-up in the first division and were elected to the Northern Premier League. Despite a poor start, new manager John King turned playing affairs round and the club enjoyed its most successful FA Cup run in 1986–87. Caernarfon Town defeated Fourth Division Stockport County at the Oval and then defeated Third Division York City in a replay before losing a third round replay again to Second Division Barnsley by a goal to nil. The Canaries finished third in the NPL and felt that, if not for the FA Cup run, they would probably have gained promotion to the Football Conference. In May 1987, King left to become manager of Tranmere Rovers and former Liverpool wing-half Tommy Smith was appointed manager but left in December 1987 after a series of poor results, giving way to Phil Wilson who had been a player with the club the previous season.

A revival in the latter half of the 1987–88 campaign lifted Caernarfon up to third place and they also reached the semi-final of the Welsh Cup before losing out (on a 2–1 aggregate) to Cardiff City.

===1989–2000===
In 1989–90, Caernarfon were relegated to the NPL&#x27;s first division and, following a series of mediocre performances over a five-year period, the club&#x27;s board of directors decided to return to Welsh football. Thus, Caernarfon were welcomed into the League of Wales in August 1995. The 1995–96 season was very successful with Caernarfon achieving sixth place in the league table and reaching the semi-finals of both the League of Wales League Cup and the North Wales Coast F.A. Cup. That led to an even more successful 1996–97 season when the Canaries challenged Barry Town for the league title before finishing fourth, just behind Ebbw Vale on goal difference and missing out on a place in Europe. The Canaries also progressed to the final of the North Wales Coast F.A. Cup before going down 2–1 to Porthmadog. Eifion Williams, the club&#x27;s leading goalscorer, twice won international recognition for Wales at under-21 level and earned Caernarfon a reported £25,000 when transferred to champions Barry Town in 1997. 1997–98 proved to be a difficult campaign marked by the failure to replace Eifion Williams in attack. The club languished at the wrong end of the table for most of the season, before pulling clear of relegation.

Paul Rowlands became the Canaries&#x27; fourth manager that season and his contagious enthusiasm turned fortunes around. Twelve months later, Town just missed out on a place in Europe after ending in fifth place and reaching the final of the Gilbert League Cup, before losing to Barry Town. Nonetheless, the disasters of 1999–2000 were just around the corner. Town began the new term badly and an even worse financial plight saw the club part company with all its players. Dixie McNeill was appointed as manager in an attempt to avert the increasingly inevitable threat of relegation. The one bright spot was Caernarfon&#x27;s 1–0 success over Swansea City in the FAW Premier Cup. The following season, however, was a marvellous time for the Canaries. The club won the Cymru Alliance championship and League Cup and also picked up the North Wales Coast Challenge Cup.

===2001–2012===
Manager Adrian Jones guided the team through this deserved success, and off the field a new stand and changing facilities were finally completed early in 2001. In 2001–02, the club enjoyed an encouraging League of Wales campaign but faded somewhat in the last third of the season and 2002–03 saw them achieve only 14th place. By early 2004, the Canaries were in contention for a top eight spot, but surprisingly decided to part company with manager Adie Jones after more than three years at the helm. Former Wrexham midfielder Wayne Phillips took the job in a caretaker role and continued on a permanent player/manager basis in 2004–05, but results did not really improve over his two seasons in charge and he stepped down in June 2007, to be replaced by former Oswestry Town and Cefn Druids manager Steve O&#x27;Shaughnessy. After occupying bottom place for much of the season, the Canaries finally improved their position at Easter and ended the season safe from the drop.

Steve O&#x27;Shaughnessey left Town at the end season 2007–08 to take over the hot seat at Connah&#x27;s Quay Nomads and was replaced by David Rowe. Rowe found his first season in the Welsh Premier extremely difficult but improved results in the latter part of the season failed to rescue Caernarfon from the drop to the Cymru Alliance.

Rowe resigned due to work commitments in September 2009 and was succeeded by the management duo of Derek Roberts and Mel Jones, the first locally based management team for 20+ years. Bouncing back at the first time of asking was the aim for this season and striving to obtain the UEFA Domestic Licence but this aim was drastically re-evaluated after a disappointing run of results saw the club languish at the bottom end of the table. Derek and Mel parted company with the club in November 2009 and ex-Buckley Town manager Simon Sedgwick was appointed to the manager&#x27;s role, along with assistant Paul Dodd.

In March 2009, with finances at an all-time low, and the club&#x27;s entire future in doubt, the chairman, George Denham and fellow directors resigned. A group of current club officials and supporters took over the running of the club and put in place a plan to keep the Club in existence. A new management team of Geraint Williams and Ernie Talbot put together a locally based squad to see the club through the last games of the 2009–10 season.

The club were relegated to the Welsh Alliance for the start of the 2010–11 season and appointed Clive Jones as their new manager after the sudden resignation of Geraint Williams.

Following a poor run of results and with the club on the bottom of the Welsh Alliance League (Division 1), Clive Jones left the managerial post by mutual consent. Steve Smith was appointed manager in November 2010 with the task of keeping the Club in the Welsh Alliance Division 1 and developing a squad that could challenge for honours the following season. Steve was assisted by Colin Saynor, who stepped down from his role as Chairman of Llanberis, and head-coach Steven Bee. The trio steered the club to a respectable 5th place by the end of the season. After such a good run Caernarfon were fancied to win the league in 2011–12 but dropped points against teams in the lower half of the table consigned them to an eventual 4th spot. In January 2012, Steve Smith left the club by mutual consent and two months later former Llangefni Town boss Lee Dixon was appointed manager.

===2013–present===
On 13 April 2013, Caernarfon Town made their way to Latham Park, Newtown, to face Kilvey Fords FC of Swansea in the 2012–13 FAW Trophy Final. They won the match 6–0 and it was their first FAW Trophy since 1978. The victory against the Swansea Senior League outfit is the biggest final winning-margin in the competition&#x27;s 123-year history. They also gained promotion to the Huws Gray Cymru Alliance during the 2012–13 by finishing top of the Welsh Alliance, taking 66 points from 28 games. On 24 September 2022 Caernarfon Town and The New Saints were invited to play in the Scottish SPFL Trust Cup, they would be drawn away to Clyde FC but were beaten 1–0 at New Douglas Park. On 18 May 2024 Caernarfon Town secured European football for the first time in their history by defeating Penybont FC in the Cymru Premier Play-offs final to secure spot in 2024-25 UEFA Europa Conference League. The team entered in the first qualifying round and played against Crusaders from Northern Ireland. After a 2–0 home win in the first leg, Caernarfon lost 1–3 after extra time in the return leg, leading to a 3–3 aggregate. Caernarfon advanced to the next round by winning the penalty shootout 8–7. In the second qualifying round, Caernarfon faced Legia Warsaw from Poland, losing 0–6 away and 0–5 at home, resulting in a 0–11 aggregate and their elimination from the competition.
