<text>Shane Brandon McMahon ( ; born January 15, 1970) is an American businessman and professional wrestler. He is best known for his two tenures in WWE from 1988 to 2009 and 2016 to 2024. 

The son of Vince McMahon, he is a fourth-generation wrestling promoter as a member of the McMahon family. He began working in WWF (World Wrestling Federation, now WWE) at age 15, starting in their warehouse, where he filled merchandise orders. McMahon was a referee, producer, announcer, and eventually a wrestler, while becoming WWE&#x27;s Executive Vice President of Global Media behind the scenes. As a wrestler, he has won the European Championship once, the Hardcore Championship, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, and the WWE World Cup in 2018.

In 2004 he founded Seven Stars Cloud Group, which became Ideanomics where he serves as executive chairman. On October 1, 2009, McMahon announced his resignation from WWE. Later that year, he became CEO of entertainment service company YOU On Demand. On July 12, 2013, McMahon stepped down as CEO of YOU On Demand and appointed Weicheng Liu as his successor, while remaining the company&#x27;s principal executive officer and Vice chairman of the board until 2021, when McMahon was promoted to Executive chairman. In 2016, he returned to WWE where he was a prominently featured figure until October 2019. Since August 2020, he has wrestled or appeared at WWE events sporadically, as of February 2025, his most recent appearance occurring at WrestleMania 39.

== Early life ==
Shane Brandon McMahon was born on January 15, 1970, in Gaithersburg, Maryland, to Vince and Linda McMahon. He has one younger sister, Stephanie McMahon. After graduating from Greenwich High School in 1987, he attended Bridgton Academy in Bridgton ME and then Boston University and in 1993 earned a degree in communications.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1988–2009) ===

==== Early years (1988–1997) ====
McMahon began his on-screen career as a referee named Shane Stevens. As Shane Stevens, McMahon refereed during the inaugural Royal Rumble match on January 24, 1988, and he was the first performer to walk out to greet the audience at WrestleMania VI on April 1, 1990. McMahon stopped performing as a referee and became a backstage official at WrestleMania VIII on April 5, 1992, in an attempt to break up a storyline brawl between Randy Savage and Ric Flair. McMahon mainly worked behind the scenes, launching WWF.com in 1997.

==== The Corporation (1998–2000) ====

McMahon made his first appearances as a regular on-air character in early 1998 during the Attitude Era, when he was one of the main WWF executives negotiating with Mike Tyson during Tyson&#x27;s heavily-hyped involvement at WrestleMania XIV on March 29. He became a recurring part of his father&#x27;s on-air feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin. In the early days of that angle, McMahon offered support for his father in cameo roles, but he did not become an enforcer like Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson. McMahon was a color commentator on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; alongside Jim Cornette and later Kevin Kelly, and announced with Jerry Lawler on the 1999 video game &quot;WWF Attitude&quot;. Concurrently with this, Shane took on the role as a regular character, turning on his father by signing Austin to a contract after Vince demoted him to the position of referee. At Survivor Series on November 15, Shane turned heel by turning on Austin and became an official member of The Corporation.

In February 1999, McMahon moved away from the commentary role on &quot;Heat&quot; and became a key component in the Corporation angle, winning the European Championship from X-Pac on the February 15 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;. The two met in a rematch at WrestleMania XV on March 28; McMahon got help from his childhood friends the Mean Street Posse and Triple H, who turned on X-Pac during the match, to retain the championship. McMahon retired the title on the April 4 episode of &quot;Heat&quot;, wanting to retire as an &quot;undefeated champion&quot;. McMahon later gave the title to Mideon, who found it in McMahon&#x27;s duffel bag, thus reactivating it.

After WrestleMania, Vince briefly made his second face run and Shane took control of the Corporation. With wrestlers such as Triple H in this new faction, Shane feuded with his father and a new faction made up of former Corporation members, The Union. On the UPN pilot for &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Shane joined forces with The Undertaker and the Ministry of Darkness to form the Corporate Ministry. Eventually, Vince was revealed to be the mastermind behind this faction, and his face turn was explained to be a plot to get the WWF Championship off Austin. Austin met Shane and Vince in a ladder match at the King of the Ring on June 27 for ownership of the WWF, as in the storyline, Austin had 50%, which was assigned to him by Linda and Stephanie McMahon, upset by Vince and Shane&#x27;s complicity in the storyline kidnapping of Stephanie by the Corporate Ministry, while Vince and Shane each had 25%. Shane and Vince won the match when a mystery associate raised the briefcase out of Austin&#x27;s reach when he climbed the ladder, allowing Vince and Shane to grab the case and regain 100% ownership of the WWF. In 1999, McMahon was awarded the Pro Wrestling Illustrated Rookie of the Year award but he declined to accept it stating &quot;These are for the boys, not me&quot;.

With his ownership reinstated, McMahon shifted his sights to, then babyface, Test, who was kayfabe dating Shane&#x27;s sister, Stephanie. Shane disapproved of the relationship, feeling Stephanie was dating &quot;beneath the family&#x27;s standards&quot;, and wound up feuding with Test. With help from the Mean Street Posse, McMahon made Test&#x27;s life a living hell. At SummerSlam on August 22, McMahon met Test in a &quot;Love Her or Leave Her&quot; match, with the stipulation being that if McMahon won the match, Test and Stephanie could no longer see each other, and if he lost, McMahon would give his blessings to the pair. Test was able to get the win, and McMahon eventually settled his differences with Test, thus making his second face run by becoming his ally. As his father, Vince, feuded with Triple H, Shane was attacked in early December 1999 by Triple H and D-Generation X (DX). He was thrown off the stage in a gang-style attack, in which Billy Gunn and Road Dogg prevented members of the Corporation from saving Shane. Later in the year, Stephanie turned heel, siding with her new kayfabe husband then-heel, Triple H (the two began their off-screen relationship around this time, but did not marry in real life until 2003). With that, the McMahon-Helmsley Faction began, and all of the other McMahons disappeared from television.

At No Way Out on February 27, 2000, Shane made his return as a heel again by trying to help Big Show defeat The Rock; these efforts failed as Vince returned the next Monday night on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, when the Rock got a rematch against Big Show and helped The Rock win the match. This started the road to WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, wherein the four-way main event each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner. The Rock had Vince, Big Show had Shane, Triple H had Stephanie, and Mick Foley had Shane&#x27;s mother, Linda McMahon. Big Show was the first man eliminated, and soon after he and Shane went their separate ways. This led to a match between the two at Judgment Day on May 21, which McMahon won after receiving help from Test and Albert, among others. Over the course of the next several months, McMahon allied himself with other heel wrestlers, specially Chris Benoit in his feud over the WWF Championship with The Rock. He was also aligned with Edge and Christian, who helped him win the Hardcore Championship from Steve Blackman on the August 21 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;. McMahon met Blackman in a rematch at SummerSlam on August 27, losing the title after falling through the stage. McMahon climbed up the set and tried to run away from Blackman, who gave chase and hit Shane with a Singapore cane, knocking him off. McMahon disappeared from television, making occasional cameo appearances.

==== The Alliance (2001–2002) ====

In 2001, Shane made his third face run by once again feuding with his father, Vince. The feud with Vince was due to the elder McMahon&#x27;s (kayfabe) affair with Trish Stratus and Vince&#x27;s spite and demand to divorce Linda McMahon. As fate would have it, rival World Championship Wrestling (WCW) was sold to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) one week before the Father versus Son match at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1. In terms of the storyline, Vince demanded that Ted Turner sign the contract at WrestleMania. With Vince&#x27;s ego getting the best of him, Shane was able to seize the opportunity and purchase WCW himself, to the shock of Vince. McMahon defeated Vince at WrestleMania in a Street Fight. At Backlash on April 29, McMahon debuted his theme song &quot;Here Comes The Money&quot; and was in a Last Man Standing match against Big Show. McMahon performed the &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; (from the top of the scaffolding), knocking himself and Big Show out. Test helped McMahon to his feet, causing McMahon to get the victory.

McMahon began a feud with Kurt Angle. By King of the Ring on June 24, McMahon&#x27;s feud with Angle had culminated. After already participating in two tournament matches that night, Angle wrestled McMahon in a Street Fight. After a suplex on the hard floor, Angle was thought to have cracked his tailbone. Angle also delivered an overhead belly to belly suplex through the plated glass stage set, but McMahon did not break through on the first attempt, causing him to fall head-first onto the concrete floor. After a successful second attempt, Angle was to put him through a second plate back out to the stage and again failed two more times. Angle proceeded to bodily hurl him through the plate glass. The match also had Shane missing a shooting star press and landing on a trash can, and ended with Angle performing the Angle Slam off the top rope before scoring the victory over a bloodied McMahon.

McMahon began to lead his WCW wrestlers against his father and the WWF wrestlers, turning heel by joining forces with Paul Heyman and his brand of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) wrestlers, along with their new owner, McMahon&#x27;s sister Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley. Calling themselves The Alliance, they pledged to finally run the WWF (and specifically their father) out of business. Ultimately, The Invasion came to a head at Survivor Series on November 18 in a match to determine which power would ultimately have control. The team, each respectively representing The Alliance and the WWF, of McMahon, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Rob Van Dam, and Booker T lost to the team of The Rock, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and Big Show. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Vince publicly fired both Shane and Stephanie, which Shane took in stride, admitting that he lost to the better man, while Stephanie pleaded with her father before being forcefully removed from the arena. Aside from a brief appearance on the July 15, 2002 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon would not be seen on television for almost two years.

==== Feud with Kane and hiatus (2003–2005) ====
McMahon made his first on-screen appearance in two years on an episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; before WrestleMania XIX, watching his father&#x27;s training in the gym to prepare his match against Hulk Hogan. At WrestleMania on March 30, 2003, he went to check on his father&#x27;s welfare following a Street Fight with Hulk Hogan, with Hogan welcoming Shane in the ring and walking out. He returned as a face in the summer by getting involved in a feud with Eric Bischoff, who had made improper remarks and gestures to Shane&#x27;s mother Linda. He defeated Bischoff in a Falls Count Anywhere match at SummerSlam on August 24. McMahon also got involved in a bitter rivalry with Kane after Kane gave Linda a &quot;Tombstone Piledriver&quot; because she did not name him the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship. Their feud culminated in McMahon losing a Last Man Standing match at Unforgiven on September 21 and an Ambulance match at Survivor Series on November 16.

After Survivor Series, McMahon left &quot;Raw&quot; to focus his attention on the executive creative staff and his new family. At WrestleMania XX on March 14, 2004, McMahon appeared briefly on camera during the opening of the event with Vince and his newborn son, Declan. On a special 3-hour episode of &quot;Raw&quot; on October 3, 2005, billed as &quot;WWE Homecoming&quot;, all four members of the McMahon family were given a &quot;Stone Cold Stunner&quot; by Stone Cold Steve Austin. The following week, Vince demanded an apology from ringside commentators for not coming to his family&#x27;s aid, which developed into a new feud. McMahon also appeared at Survivor Series on November 27, though he did not appear on television. He can be seen on the DVD extra backstage talking to Theodore Long, when The Boogeyman tried to scare off McMahon, who made no deal about it.

==== Feud with D-Generation X and Bobby Lashley (2006–2007) ====

McMahon returned in 2006 as a heel by again siding with his father to help in the feud with Shawn Michaels. At the Royal Rumble on January 29, Shane (despite not competing in the match) eliminated Michaels from the Royal Rumble match by throwing him over the top rope. After weeks of attacks from behind by Shane, one of which saw him force an unconscious Michaels to kiss Vince&#x27;s rear end, Shane and Michaels faced each other in a Street Fight on the March 18 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXII&quot;. In a fashion similar to the real-life Montreal Screwjob, Shane put Michaels in the Sharpshooter as Vince called for the bell and gave Shane the victory. The McMahons&#x27; feud with Michaels took a religious turn at WrestleMania 22 on April 2, where Michaels defeated Vince McMahon. Vince claimed that Michaels&#x27;s victory was a result of &quot;divine intervention&quot; and booked himself and his son in a match at Backlash on April 30 against Michaels and his tag team partner &quot;God&quot;. Around this time, Vince began to act strangely and at one point considered himself a god. Shane, who at this time was referred to by Vince as &quot;the product of his semen&quot;, teamed with Vince to defeat Michaels and &quot;God&quot; at Backlash, due to help from the Spirit Squad.
This feud later enveloped Triple H, who the McMahons had enlisted to take out Michaels. Triple H was getting frustrated with this, as it was distracting from his quest to regain the WWE Championship. Triple H wound up bashing Shane with his signature weapon, the sledgehammer, in what was considered to be an accident that put Shane out of the ring for a while. Vince (and later Shane, who had recovered) sought to humble Triple H and get some retribution. Triple H began a feud with the McMahons shortly after, leading to his siding with Shawn Michaels and the reformation of D-Generation X (DX). At SummerSlam on August 20, the McMahons were defeated by DX. About a month later at Unforgiven on September 17, The McMahons and then ECW World Champion Big Show faced DX in a Hell in a Cell match. Shane was injured after Michaels&#x27; elbow dropped a chair which was around Shane&#x27;s neck. DX emerged victorious at Unforgiven, and Shane disappeared from television.

On the March 5, 2007 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon came back to inform his father, Vince, about the &quot;guest referee&quot; for the &quot;Battle of the Billionaires.&quot; He told him that their opponents on the Board of Directors had won the vote, 5–4. The McMahons had intended for Shane to be the referee. Instead, the guest referee turned out to be the McMahons&#x27; old rival, the Texas rattlesnake Stone Cold Steve Austin. During the &quot;Battle of the Billionaires&quot; match at WrestleMania 23 on April 1, Shane&#x27;s attempt to interfere on his father&#x27;s behalf was stopped by Austin. During the match, Shane was able to hit the &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; dive with a trash can into Bobby Lashley&#x27;s face. On the April 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Shane officially joined the Vince/Umaga/Lashley feud when he faced Lashley for the ECW World Championship in a Title vs. Hair match which ended in Shane getting disqualified on purpose by punching the referee. After the match, Umaga, Vince, and Shane all attacked Lashley. At Backlash on April 29 in a handicap match for the ECW World Championship, Shane along with Vince and Umaga defeated Lashley for the title. Vince gained the pin making him the ECW World Champion. At Judgment Day on May 20, Lashley faced Shane, Vince, and Umaga again, in a rematch for the ECW World Championship. This time, Lashley won the match, but since he pinned Shane rather than Vince, Vince remained the champion. At One Night Stand on June 3, Shane and Umaga tried to help Vince retain the ECW World Championship against Lashley, but failed when Lashley speared Vince and pinned him for the win.

On the taped episode of &quot;Raw&quot; that aired on September 3, Shane, along with his mother Linda and his sister Stephanie, made appearances to confront Vince about his illegitimate child. Shane returned at Survivor Series on November 18 to accompany Hornswoggle, alongside his father, in his match against The Great Khali. After that, he was only seen on WWE&#x27;s pay-per-view No Way Out on February 17, 2008, talking to Big Show after the latter had his nose legitimately broken going by the plan to push Mayweather&#x27;s speed by Floyd Mayweather Jr. before again not being seen until June.

==== Feud with The Legacy and departure (2008–2009) ====
After the severe injury that Vince McMahon sustained on the June 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when a sign fell on top of him during his hosting of the &quot;Million Dollar Mania&quot; sweepstakes, Shane requested for the &quot;Raw&quot; roster to stand together during what was a turbulent time. Shane&#x27;s plea, however, was ignored and subsequently, Shane and his sister Stephanie urged the roster to show solidarity. On the July 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Shane made an appearance to announce Mike Adamle as his and Stephanie&#x27;s choice to be the new &quot;Raw&quot; general manager. After Adamle stepped down as general manager, he and Stephanie became the interim on-screen authority figures for the &quot;Raw&quot; program. On the November 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Shane and Stephanie argued over who was in charge, leading to Stephanie telling him that &quot;Raw&quot; is her show. After being slapped by Stephanie, Shane finished the segment by telling her that from that day onwards, he was going to watch Stephanie run &quot;Raw&quot; &quot;right into the ground&quot;.

At the start of 2009, Randy Orton began a feud with the McMahon family. On the January 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton punted Mr. McMahon in the head, after he had tried to fire Orton from the company for previous comments made about Stephanie. The following week, Shane returned to television and attacked Orton for his actions, turning face for the first time since 2006. On the February 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, it was revealed that Orton challenged Shane to a No Holds Barred match at No Way Out on February 15, to which he accepted, but was defeated by Orton in the match. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Shane challenged Orton to a match for that episode&#x27;s main event. The match ended with Orton punting Shane in the head, as well as performing an &quot;RKO&quot; on Stephanie McMahon.

Shane returned on the March 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, alongside Triple H and his father Vince McMahon, to confront and attack The Legacy (Randy Orton, Ted DiBiase, and Cody Rhodes). On the April 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, it was announced that Shane would compete in a six-man tag team match against The Legacy at Backlash on April 26 alongside Triple H and Batista, the latter of whom had returned from injury, where the stipulation was that if any member of Orton&#x27;s team pinned any member of Triple H&#x27;s team, Orton would win Triple H&#x27;s WWE Championship; however, if any member of Orton&#x27;s team was counted out or disqualified, Triple H would retain the title. On the May 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Shane&#x27;s character suffered a broken leg and ankle at the hands of Orton and Legacy as a way to write him out of the story. On October 1, 2009, Shane departed WWE.

=== Return to WWE (2016–2024) ===

==== Commissioner of Smackdown and various feuds (2016–2017) ====
On the February 22, 2016 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Shane returned to WWE as a face for the first time in nearly seven years, interrupting his sister, Stephanie McMahon, receiving the &quot;Vincent J. McMahon Legacy of Excellence&quot; Award from their father, Vince McMahon. Shane announced that the reason he had returned was that he wanted control of &quot;Raw&quot;, leading to Vince placing Shane in a Hell in a Cell match at WrestleMania 32 on April 3 against The Undertaker, adding the stipulation that Shane would get control of &quot;Raw&quot; and The Undertaker would no longer be a participant in future WrestleMania events if Shane were to win the match. At WrestleMania, Shane attempted a Leap of Faith off the top of the cell, but The Undertaker moved out of the way, and Shane fell through an announce table. Shane was defeated by The Undertaker soon after.

Despite losing at WrestleMania, Shane controlled &quot;Raw&quot; for a month, firstly by his father, Vince, on the &quot;Raw&quot; after WrestleMania, then for the following three weeks after &quot;popular demand on social media&quot;. This led to Stephanie confronting Shane, telling him that their father will decide who will control &quot;Raw&quot; at Payback on May 1, where Vince announced that both Shane and Stephanie would be Co-general managers and have joint control of WWE.

In July, after the announcement of the return of the brand extension with &quot;SmackDown&quot; moving to Tuesday, Vince appointed Shane as the storyline commissioner of the SmackDown brand and Stephanie as the commissioner of Raw before tasking them to name a general manager for their respective shows. Shane appointed Daniel Bryan as the general manager of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. At SummerSlam on August 21, Brock Lesnar won his match against Randy Orton by technical knockout and continued to assault Orton as he was being tended to. Shane confronted Lesnar, which resulted in Shane being attacked by Lesnar with an F-5. On the November 8 episode of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;, Shane agreed to replace an injured Baron Corbin in the traditional Survivor Series tag team elimination match between the two brands. At Survivor Series on November 20, Team SmackDown defeated Team Raw. McMahon suffered a legitimate concussion following a spear from Roman Reigns, resulting in his elimination. In December, McMahon would take over host duties for &quot;Talking Smack&quot; with Daniel Bryan taking time off for family reasons.

On the February 21, 2017 episode of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;, after AJ Styles and Luke Harper simultaneously eliminated each other in a number one contender&#x27;s battle royal as the final two entrants, McMahon made singles match between the two for the February 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot; with the winner going on to face Bray Wyatt for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 33 on April 2. Styles would originally go on to win the match before McMahon would restart the contest due to Harper having his foot on the rope during the pinfall. After McMahon accidentally distracted Harper, Styles would capitalize and pin Harper once again. That same week, after Randy Orton turned on Wyatt and cashed in his Royal Rumble winning opportunity, McMahon would go on to book a number one contender&#x27;s match and the now even more infuriated Styles lost to Orton on the March 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;. After losing the match, Styles would confront McMahon in the Gorilla position with things getting physical between the pair. The following week, Styles attacked McMahon inside the parking lot, which caused McMahon to be busted open and suffer a storyline concussion. Due to this, Styles was (kayfabe) &quot;fired&quot; from SmackDown. However, as McMahon was about to leave, he went back to the arena and announced that he will face Styles at WrestleMania 33. On April 2, at WrestleMania 33, McMahon lost to AJ Styles in a singles match. On April 4; the first episode of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot; after WrestleMania, McMahon and Styles shook hands, ending the feud.

==== Feud with Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn (2017–2018) ====
On the August 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, McMahon had a serious argument with Kevin Owens due to losing to AJ Styles for the United States Championship. Owens demanded a competent referee, so Daniel Bryan chose McMahon to become the special guest referee. The following week on &quot;SmackDown&quot;, McMahon was accidentally attacked by Styles during a brawl between Styles and Owens. Following the incident, on the August 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, McMahon warned Styles that if he puts his hands on him, he will put his hands on Styles. The warning later came to Owens after he accidentally attacked McMahon. At SummerSlam, McMahon was about to count the pin and declare Owens the winner, however after seeing Styles&#x27; foot on the bottom rope, McMahon continued the match. A frustrated Owens pushed McMahon, causing McMahon to push Owens back. This caused a distraction for Styles to win back the United States Championship. On the August 22 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, McMahon allowed a rematch between Styles and Owens. During the match, McMahon made himself referee after seeing the poor officiating from guest referee Baron Corbin, which caused a confrontation from Owens. This allowed Styles to take advantage and pin Owens to retain the championship. On the September 5 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, after a brief confrontation with Owens, McMahon proceeded to beat down Owens after warning him not to talk about his family. Soon after, Daniel Bryan came out to announce that Shane had been &quot;suspended indefinitely&quot; by Vince McMahon, who would be returning to &quot;SmackDown&quot; next week. On the September 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, CEO and Chairman of WWE, Vince announced that Shane would be facing Owens at Hell in a Cell, in a Hell in a Cell match. At Hell in a Cell, Owens won after being saved by Sami Zayn from McMahon&#x27;s Leap of Faith from the top of the cell to the announcer&#x27;s table, was dragged by Zayn to pin McMahon.

On the October 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon fired the first shot in the build of the SmackDown-Raw feud for Survivor Series when he appeared with most of the &quot;SmackDown&quot; roster to attack the Raw roster, after initially being friendly with Kurt Angle earlier on in the same night. They proceeded to beat up wrestlers part of the &quot;Raw&quot; roster and bring Angle back to the ring. McMahon told Angle to bring his gold medal and the remains of the roster to Survivor Series and that at Survivor Series, they would finish what they started. However, several weeks later, on the November 14 edition of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, during the main event between The New Day vs Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn, The Shield announced their presence and came down to the ring to face The New Day in payback for The New Day&#x27;s distraction on the November 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; costing Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose the WWE Raw Tag Team Championship. Worse was to come, as when The Usos tried to help, they were attacked by Cesaro and Sheamus, the Raw women&#x27;s locker room attacked the SmackDown women&#x27;s locker room, and when the rest of the SmackDown male roster came down with McMahon to the ring to help, they were attacked in turn by the rest of the Raw male roster, including Angle and Braun Strowman. Shane was given two triple powerbombs by The Shield, and an Angle Slam by Angle, as retribution for the trouble the &quot;SmackDown&quot; roster pulled on &quot;Raw&quot; the last couple of weeks, and to prove that come to the pay-per-view, Team Raw would be victorious over Team SmackDown. At Survivor Series, Shane was the last man to be eliminated by Triple H, meaning Team SmackDown lost.

On March 11, 2018, at Fastlane, Shane McMahon pulled the referee out of the ring when Kevin Owens covered Dolph Ziggler and pulled Sami Zayn out of the ring when he covered Kevin Owens. On the March 13 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Shane McMahon announced his indefinite leave of absence as SmackDown&#x27;s commissioner. Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn proceeded to attack Shane McMahon in the ring and behind the entrance. Shane (kayfabe) suffered a laryngeal contusion, trapezius, and rhomboid strains. He was taken to a local medical facility. On March 26, 2018, WWE.com reported that Shane legitimately had acute diverticulitis while resting with his family in the Caribbean on March 14, and was hospitalized in Antigua for a few days before he was moved to a hospital in New York where doctors also found that Shane has an umbilical hernia that required surgery once the infection was eradicated. McMahon posted the below message to his Instagram account: &quot;Thank you, everyone, for the get well wishes. It truly helps. I&#x27;m healing up, and I have the best medicine in the world with me.&quot; It was announced that Shane would team up with Daniel Bryan against Owens and Zayn at WrestleMania 34. McMahon returned on the April 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, to address his WrestleMania match, saying that Owens and Zayn would never be seen in a SmackDown arena again. At WrestleMania, Bryan and McMahon defeated Zayn and Owens.

He competed at the Greatest Royal Rumble, where he entered the namesake match at No. 47 before being eliminated after getting choke slammed off the top rope through a table by Braun Strowman. He took time off to heal from the injuries he suffered two months prior, returning on the 1000th edition of &quot;SmackDown&quot; on October 16 alongside Stephanie McMahon and Vince McMahon on the &quot;Truth TV&quot; segment hosted by R-Truth and Carmella. Following in December, The McMahon Family (Vince, Stephanie, Shane, and Triple H) appeared on &quot;Raw&quot; and announced that they would be running both Raw and SmackDown as a group with no general managers.

==== Best in the World (2018–2019) ====
At the Crown Jewel event in November, he replaced The Miz after the latter suffered a (kayfabe) injury in the finals of the WWE World Cup, and won by defeating Dolph Ziggler in under three minutes, winning the tournament. The Miz began a pursuit to form a tag team with McMahon, who finally agreed, and the duo faced SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Bar (Cesaro and Sheamus) at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, winning the titles. At Elimination Chamber the following month, however, they lost the titles to The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), and failed to regain them at Fastlane, after which, McMahon attacked The Miz and taunted The Miz&#x27;s father. McMahon began proclaiming himself as the &quot;Best in the World&quot; and scheduled a match between himself and The Miz at WrestleMania 35, which The Miz requested to be a Falls Count Anywhere match, and McMahon agreed. At WrestleMania, McMahon narrowly defeated The Miz after being superplexed off a 15-foot platform and landing on top of The Miz for the 3 counts although both men were unconscious. On the April 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, McMahon helped Bobby Lashley defeat The Miz, who was drafted to Raw, and McMahon attacked The Miz. Later that night, The Miz challenged McMahon to a Steel Cage Match at Money in the Bank, which McMahon accepted.

While simultaneously feuding with The Miz on Raw, over on SmackDown, Elias and Roman Reigns were drafted to the brand. Shane&#x27;s father Vince introduced Elias as SmackDown&#x27;s biggest acquisition on the April 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;. The two were confronted by Reigns, who attacked Elias and attacked Vince with the Superman Punch. The following week, Shane called out Reigns for a fight for attacking his father, but Reigns was attacked from behind by Elias, who was assisted by Shane, allying Elias and Shane. Shane forced Reigns to face The B-Team (Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel) in a handicap match with Elias as the special referee enforcer that Reigns won. The following week on &quot;SmackDown Live&quot;, Shane teamed with Elias, Daniel Bryan, and Rowan in a seven-man handicap match and defeated the team of Reigns and The Usos. At Money in the Bank, Shane once again defeated The Miz this time by escaping the cage ending their feud. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Shane confronted Roman Reigns with Reigns challenging Shane to a match at Super ShowDown which Shane accepted. At Super ShowDown, Shane defeated Roman Reigns after interference from Drew McIntyre. Shane and McIntyre lost to Reigns and The Undertaker in a No Holds Barred tag team match at Extreme Rules.

Following this, McMahon re-ignited his feud with Kevin Owens, after Owens stated his distaste in McMahon&#x27;s constant dominance on television and began to hit him with the &quot;Stunner&quot; on countless occasions. McMahon lost to Owens at SummerSlam where had Owens lost he would have quit WWE. McMahon later replaced an injured Elias in a semi-final match against Chad Gable for the 2019 King of the Ring tournament, and Owens was made the referee, and despite McMahon&#x27;s promise to consider dropping a fine for Owens damaging expensive equipment, Owens allowed Gable to win, and Owens was hereby fired. However, Owens continued to appear on television to issue legal threats, until October 4&#x27;s WWE SmackDown&#x27;s 20th Anniversary episode, where McMahon was fired after losing a ladder match against Owens.

==== Part time appearances (2020–2024) ====
After a ten-month hiatus from television, McMahon returned, as a face, on the August 3, 2020, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as the host of Raw Underground, a segment presented as an unsanctioned fight club. It was canceled after the September 21 episode. On November 22, 2020, he made an in-ring appearance at Survivor Series during The Undertaker&#x27;s retirement ceremony.

In February, incensed at being left out of Raw&#x27;s Elimination Chamber match, Braun Strowman started to take issue with McMahon. After a failed attempt to rectify things with Strowman, McMahon began to insult Strowman&#x27;s intelligence, thus turning heel in the process. Strowman challenged McMahon to a match on the March 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, in which McMahon won. Strowman challenged McMahon to a Steel Cage match at WrestleMania 37 and McMahon accepted. At the event, McMahon was defeated by Strowman.

McMahon returned at the 2022 Royal Rumble event in the namesake match at number 28, as a face, lasting until the final three, but was eliminated by the eventual winner Brock Lesnar. McMahon received intense criticism by fans, critics, and employees for his role in and the booking of the rumble match for trying to make himself look stronger than the full time wrestlers. Amidst the controversy and backstage heat on February 2, McMahon had been quietly &quot;let go&quot; by the company.

McMahon returned over a year later in April 2023 at WrestleMania 39 alongside Snoop Dogg, in an impromptu match against The Miz; however, he tore his quad muscle early in the match and was unable to continue. Snoop Dogg replaced him and won the match in his place.

In June 2024, it was reported that McMahon was no longer contracted to WWE, ending his second tenure with the company.

==Professional wrestling style and persona==
McMahon uses a move named &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, where he jumps from the top rope and cross the ring, delivering a dropkick to an opponent, usually with a trash can situated in between the opponent&#x27;s face. Though with the WWE&#x27;s concerns over concussions he does not use a trash can, instead dropkicking the opponent with no weapon in place. He started using the move after Paul Heyman showed him a video of Rob Van Dam performing the move. He also styles his punches and footwork after Muhammad Ali, and often (in high-risk spots) uses a diving elbow drop named the &quot;Leap of Faith.&quot;

== Business career ==
===WWE===
Shane McMahon began working in WWE at age 15, starting in their warehouse, where he filled merchandise orders. McMahon was a referee, producer, announcer, and eventually a wrestler on-screen, while becoming WWE&#x27;s Executive Vice President of Global Media behind the scenes. In 1992, McMahon was already backstage official and working behind the scenes for the company. In 1997, McMahon helped launch WWE&#x27;s official website. By the year 2000, McMahon was very much a part of the decision process in WWE, and that included creative.

On October 21, 2006, McMahon attended Pride 32 at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Paradise, Nevada resulting in speculation that WWE were considering promoting MMA events. On November 17, 2006, WWE and Dream Stage Entertainment officials, the parent company of Pride Fighting Championships, held a meeting at WWE global headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut. The meeting focused on the possibility of the two groups doing some form of business together in the future. Yet on March 27, 2007, Nobuyuki Sakakibara, president of DSE, announced that Station Casinos, Inc. magnate Lorenzo Fertitta, also one of the co-owners of Zuffa, the parent company of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, had made a deal to acquire all the assets of Pride FC from DSE after Pride 34 in a deal worth about US$70 million, thereby ceasing any prospective business between Pride and WWE.

Later in November 2006, McMahon and WWE Canada President Carl De Marco traveled to South America to finalize a major TV deal in Brazil, which allowed their television station to air &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;.

In September 2008, McMahon finalized another major TV deal, this time in Mexico, which allowed WWE programming to air on Mexico&#x27;s two biggest television networks, &quot;Raw&quot; on Televisa and &quot;SmackDown&quot; on TV Azteca.

On October 16, 2009, WWE published a statement from Shane McMahon announcing his resignation from his position as WWE&#x27;s Executive Vice President of Global Media, and also issued an official press release stating that the resignation was tendered effective January 1, 2010. No specific reason was given for the resignation. McMahon stated in the WWE press release, &quot;Having been associated with this organization for the majority of my life, I feel this is the opportune time in my career to pursue outside ventures.&quot; thus ending his 20-year stint with the company on January 1, 2010. McMahon&#x27;s resignation left only two original members of the McMahon family activities within the company; his father Vince, and his sister, Stephanie.

As of late 2019, McMahon began working as a producer for WWE once again.

In May 2020, it was revealed that the reasons for Shane McMahon&#x27;s resignation from his role as Executive Vice President of WWE in 2009, was because &quot;he realized that his father Vince, saw his sister Stephanie and her husband Triple H as the heirs to the throne&quot; and &quot;was tired of his father Vince, overlooking his ideas&quot; for what he envisioned for the company. In 2022, however, It was reported that despite having a part time WWE contract and no major production role with his family&#x27;s company, McMahon had in fact had a history with booking Royal Rumble matches, with Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful even stating following the controversy surrounding the 2022 Royal Rumble that &quot;Though he wasn&#x27;t listed as a producer internally for the Royal Rumble, he helped put the match together, which he&#x27;s done before in the past.&quot;

===Other business ventures===
Outside of his WWE business ventures, McMahon founded a financial technology company called China Broadband Inc, on October 19, 2004. On August 3, 2010, McMahon became the CEO of China Broadband Inc., a provider of cable broadband services, as well as other digital and analog related services, in Shandong of China. The company is based in Boulder County, Colorado. Also in 2010, McMahon became the CEO of You On Demand, the first video-on-demand and pay-per-view service in China. In July 2013, McMahon stepped down as CEO of You On Demand. McMahon remained Executive Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company until August 2, 2021, when McMahon was promoted to Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company, which has undergone several name changes since that time, including Wecast Holdings Inc., Seven Stars Cloud Group, Inc., and ultimately, Ideanomics. The company is headquartered in New York City.

As of April 2011, McMahon sits on the Board of Directors for International Sports Management.

McMahon is a part owner of the Indian Larry Motorcycle Shop in Brooklyn, New York.

== Personal life ==
McMahon is married to Marissa Mazzola. They have three sons. His sons appeared at WrestleMania 32, accompanying him to the ring in his match against The Undertaker; they have been seen in the crowd for some of his more recent matches.

McMahon usually wears baseball jerseys for his matches, with the front saying &quot;Shane O Mac&quot; and the back reserved for &quot;McMahon&quot;, the name of the pay-per-view in which he&#x27;s participating, or some other phrase relating to the match and/or his opponent. When his father, Vince, was interviewed in &quot;Playboy&quot;, he mentioned that although Shane is right-handed, he often throws left-handed punches. McMahon&#x27;s football jersey number was 61, the same as his father. On July 19, 2017, McMahon was involved in a helicopter crash, but was relatively unharmed.

McMahon is an avid fan of mixed martial arts. He trains in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu under Renzo Gracie, as well as Muay Thai under Phil Nurse.

== Other media ==
In September 2006, he was named one of &quot;Detail&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Most Powerful Men Under 42&quot; in the annual &quot;power issue&quot;.

<text>Small office/home office (or single office/home office; sometimes short SOHO) refers to the category of business or cottage industry that involves from 1 to 1000 workers. 
In New Zealand, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) defines a small office as 6–19 employees and a micro office as 1–5.

==History==
Before the 19th century, and the spread of the Industrial Revolution around the globe, nearly all offices were small offices and/or home offices, with only a few exceptions. Most businesses were small, and the paperwork that accompanied them was limited. The industrial revolution aggregated workers in factories, to mass-produce goods. In most circumstances, the white collar counterpart—office work—was aggregated as well in large buildings, usually in cities or densely populated suburban areas.

Beginning in the mid-1980s, the advent of the personal computer and fax machine, plus breakthroughs in telecommunications, created opportunities for office workers to decentralize. Decentralization was also perceived as benefiting employers in terms of lower overheads and potentially greater productivity.

==Professions==
Many consultants and the members of such professions like lawyers, real estate agents, and surveyors in small and medium-sized towns operate from home offices.

Several ranges of products, such as the armoire desk, all-in-one printer, virtual assistants, home servers and network-attached storage are designed specifically for the SOHO market. A number of books and magazines have been published and marketed specifically at this type of office. These range from general advice texts to specific guidebooks on such challenges as setting up a small PBX for the office telephones.

Technology has also created a demand for larger businesses to employ individuals who work from home. Sometimes these people remain as independent businesspersons, and sometimes they become employees of a larger company.

The small office home office has undergone a transformation since its advent as the Internet has enabled anyone working from a home office to compete globally. Technology has made this possible through email, the World-Wide Web, e-commerce, videoconferencing, remote desktop software, VPN, VLAN, webinar systems, and telephone connections by VOIP. Due to the increase in small and home offices, web services and standard business software have been created to directly assist smaller businesses in standard business practice 

In many countries, a home office can be claimed as a tax deduction only if office space and supplies are not provided by a corporate office.

<text>Western Sydney University, formerly the University of Western Sydney, is an Australian multi-campus public research university in the Greater Western region of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

The university in its current form was founded in 1989 as a federated network university with an amalgamation between the Nepean College of Advanced Education and the Hawkesbury Agricultural College. The Macarthur Institute of Higher Education was incorporated in the university in 1989. In 2001, the University of Western Sydney was restructured as a single multi-campus university rather than as a federation. In 2015, the university underwent a rebranding which resulted in a change in name from the University of Western Sydney to Western Sydney University. It is a provider of undergraduate, postgraduate, and higher research degrees with campuses in Bankstown, Blacktown, Campbelltown, Hawkesbury, Liverpool, Parramatta, Penrith, and Surabaya.

== History ==
=== Foundation and early years (1988–1990s)===
The university consists of an amalgamation of campuses, each with their own unique and individual history. In 1891, the Hawkesbury campus was established as an agricultural college by the NSW Agricultural Society. At Parramatta, Western Sydney University owns and has renovated the Female Orphan School building, the foundation stone of which was laid by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1813.

In 1987, the New South Wales Labor government planned to name the university Chifley University, after the former Labor prime minister, Ben Chifley. However, in 1989, a new Liberal government reversed this decision and controversially named it the University of Western Sydney.

In 1989, teachers&#x27; colleges and Colleges of Advanced Education in Sydney&#x27;s western suburbs were given university status under the &quot;University of Western Sydney Act 1988&quot;. The 1990s saw the federation of three education providers: UWS Nepean, UWS Hawkesbury, and UWS Macarthur. The university has a legislative basis in NSW state legislation with the passing of the &quot;University of Western Sydney Act 1997&quot;, which also empowers the university to make by-laws affecting the operation of the university.

A performing arts school had been established at UWS&#x27;s predecessor, the Nepean College of Advanced Education, in 1980. There was a School of Visual and Performing Arts in the 1990s at UWS Nepean at Kingswood. The early incarnation of the school comprised three specialisations, acting, dance, and theatremaking. The drama school at UWS became known as Theatre Nepean. In 1997, a student-led organisation, CentreStage, was created by second-year performance students as a fund-raising body to cover the costs of staging and promoting Theatre Nepean&#x27;s graduation productions not only at the Playhouse at the Kingswood campus and the Centre for Contemporary Performance at the Werrington South campus. Ruth Cracknell was its founding patron (and patron of Theatre Nepean until her death in 2002), with John Bell patron, and 1987 graduate of Theatre Nepean, David Wenham, its ambassador in 2002. At some point, due to lack of funding, the school amalgamated its three-discipline program into a single course.

=== Restructuring (2000s) ===
Federal government funding of Australia&#x27;s universities as a percentage of Australia&#x27;s GDP was in decline during the years of the Howard government. Federal funding policy was very influential at UWS. In 2000, after internal restructuring and cost-cutting, UWS Hawkesbury, UWS Macarthur, and UWS Nepean ceased to exist as autonomous components of the now defunct University of Western Sydney federation and became the new multi-campus University of Western Sydney.

In the 2000s, UWS consolidated its schools of fine art, social science, humanities, and psychology. In this decade the university introduced its first nanotechnology and biotechnology undergraduate degrees.

In 2003, UWS sponsored a Samuel Beckett symposium as part of the Sydney Festival. In 2004, UWS joined with Metro Screen and SLICE TV to successfully bid for Sydney&#x27;s first permanent community television licence. Television Sydney, broadcasting as TVS, launched in February 2006 from a broadcast operations centre located on the Werrington South Campus. In 2006, the UWS news site reported: &quot;Demand to study at the University of Western Sydney is on the rise, with UWS receiving the third-biggest jump in first preferences among NSW and ACT universities for 2007&quot;.

In 2007, Theatre Nepean was suspended indefinitely, and the Australian Academy of Dramatic Art (AADA; now Australian Institute of Music - Dramatic Arts, or AIMDA) began a similar training program the following year, aiming at producing graduates who are all-round theatre-makers. Also in 2007, UWS had its first intake for Bachelor of Medicine / Bachelor of Surgery degree courses. In the same year, UWS was part of a consortium with Griffith University and the University of Melbourne to win funding for a National Centre of Excellence for Islamic Studies.

In 2008, UWS announced new water and energy saving strategies, its Indigenous Advisory Board (announced on in August 2008) and endorsed prime minister Kevin Rudd&#x27;s Apology to Australia&#x27;s Indigenous peoples.

In 2011 and 2012, Professors Roy Tasker and James Arvanitakis respectively, were announced as the Prime Minister&#x27;s Australian University Teacher of the Year.

===Renaming (2015)===
On 30 August 2015, the University of Western Sydney underwent a rebranding which resulted in a change in name to Western Sydney University. Many students criticised the re-branding, calling it a waste of money that stripped the university community of its established identity.

== Campuses and buildings ==
Western Sydney University is a multi-campus institution. Each campus hosts an array of courses and different units can be completed across multiple campuses.

=== Parramatta ===
The Parramatta Campus was first established on the site of the Female Orphan School, which was founded in 1813. The site was formerly home to Rydalmere Psychiatric hospital and is located at the eastern end of Parramatta, near the border with the suburb of Rydalmere. It now houses the Whitlam Institute.

The Rydalmere campus was established as a campus of UWS in 1998. It is the nearest campus to the Sydney CBD.

Parramatta campus courses include occupation fields like Science, Business, and Law. It also hosts their Science courses in modern buildings near to the Rydalmere campus at a site formerly used by quarantine authorities, CSIRO, Amdel Sugar, and the Biological and Chemical Research Institute laboratories.

The university announced the establishment of a new campus in the Parramatta CBD as an extension of its existing Parramatta Campus in 2014.

=== Bankstown ===
The Bankstown Campus which opened in 1989, was located at Milperra, about from the Bankstown CBD. Specialising in the social sciences, most of the students on campus are psychology, sociology, arts, linguistics, and education students. The campus also hosts the Bachelor of Policing degree and much of The MARCS Institute. The campus also included a modern cafeteria/eatery area as well as Oliver Brown.

Students on campus specialise in the social sciences. Most are psychology, sociology, nursing, arts and linguistic students. The campus is also home to the Bachelor of Policing program. The campus includes a modern cafeteria area, a new library, a full-size football oval, and the MARCS Institute.
UWS&#x27;s most well-known interpreting and translation course is taught at Bankstown campus. UWS trains and produces many NAATI accredited interpreters and translators.

It was the original campus of the Macarthur Institute of Higher Education, which merged into the then-new university in 1989; however, as a result of widespread rebuilding by WSU, the oldest building on campus was opened in 1989. The building contains a plaque indicating that it was opened by the then treasurer and later Prime Minister Paul Keating.

Western Sydney University has built a new vertical campus in the Bankstown CBD which opened in March 2023. The campus caters to 10,000 students and 700 staff with courses in education, psychology, business and IT. In December 2019, Western Sydney University announced a partnership with the University of Technology Sydney which will see the two universities collaborate on postgraduate teaching and research. The two universities will also co-locate their business incubator programs at the new Bankstown City Campus. The new Bankstown City campus was officially opened in December 2022, and commenced teaching in early 2023.

=== Blacktown ===
In 2009, Western Sydney University opened The College at the old Blacktown campus of the university after protest about the divesting of property and resources from the site.

The university&#x27;s Nirimba campus is built on the site of HMAS &quot;Nirimba&quot;, a former naval aviation base, and is also known as the Nirimba Education Precinct, located in Nirimba Fields, about a 10-minute drive from Blacktown. The nearest railway station is Quakers Hill station in the neighbouring suburb of Quakers Hill. The campus has many historical buildings and two crossed air runways that ceased operation 1994. The Nirimba campus has student accommodation, air-conditioned lecture theatres and rooms built in the 1990s. The campus has views of the now closed Schofields Aerodrome. Campus numbers have dwindled since the university reduced the range of courses available. The campus is primarily a single-discipline campus, offering business courses which are also taught at other Western Sydney University campuses. Nirimba campus is not far from Norwest Business Park.

Located in the Nirimba Education Precinct in Nirimba Fields, the campus is the home of the Western Sydney University-owned UWSCollege. Western Sydney University shares the precinct with TAFE NSW-Western Sydney Institute, Nirimba College, St John Paul II Catholic College and Wyndham College.

In recent times there has been much controversy over the status of this campus, at one point Western Sydney University was depicted in the media as abandoning the campus and the local area it served. There was even a council run protest at the closure called Save UWS Nirimba, where politicians and the university were petitioned to save the campus from closure, later it was decided rather than divesting they would set up The College. Western Sydney University has recently announced for its Blacktown campus a brand new Medical facility called the Blacktown-Mount Druitt Clinical school which would be based at Blacktown Hospital, making it the second clinical school associated with the School of Medicine; the first school being the Macarthur Clinical School at Campbelltown Hospital which opened in March 2007. In 2017 the university announced plans to sell off land held on the Nirimba site, previously set aside for student accommodation.

The library located in C21 was originally a dual purpose library, though run and staffed by Western Sydney University it was also used as the TAFE library. Now a &#x27;triple purpose&#x27; library is also caters to the students of The College. Both WSI TAFE and The College provide funding to Western Sydney University for this privilege, however as with all Western Sydney University libraries, purchasing, collection maintenance and staffing is managed centrally.

=== Campbelltown ===
The Campbelltown Campus is located in the semi-rural Macarthur region in South Western Sydney. Together with the Bankstown campus, the Campbelltown campus was originally part of the Macarthur Institute of Higher Education, founded in 1984. The campus offers degrees (among many others) in medicine, health, sciences, nursing, law and business. Research centres are also located in the campus.

In 2007, the School of Medicine was established and began offering the Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree for the first time in the university&#x27;s history. It is hoped that many of the School&#x27;s graduates will practice in the Western Sydney region, in order to redress the shortage of healthcare professionals in the area.

The on-campus student accommodation (called &#x27;Gunydji&#x27;) was upgraded in 2010 with a maximum occupancy of 205. It is a complex of self-contained units that accommodate one to five tenants each.

The campus is home to the UWS Rotary Observatory, designed by Dr. Ragbir Bhathal, consisting of two observing domes of 4.5m and 2.9m diameter respectively, opened on 15 July 2000. The observatory is principally utilised for Optical S.E.T.I. research but also hosts community astronomy nights, in collaboration with Macarthur Astronomical Society. In 2013 the observatory was relocated to make way for a new residential housing estate to the south of the campus. It was reopened in a new location on 2 October 2014. The campus also provides the venue for the Macarthur Astronomy Forum.

=== Hawkesbury ===

The Hawkesbury campus, also known as the Richmond campus, is located on a site in the Hawkesbury Valley in north-western Sydney, next to the town of Richmond. Courses are offered in environmental health, forensic science, nursing, medical science, natural science (environmental, agricultural, horticultural), secondary school science teaching. Hawkesbury campus facilities include research labs, farmland, aquacultural (not operational) and equine facilities, residential halls and cottages, a conference centre, religious centres, a campus social hub called Stable Square, featuring cafeterias, a bar (not operational), a music room and a large collection of Hawkesbury Agricultural College memorabilia.

The campus was originally the Hawkesbury Agricultural College, established by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in 1891. It later became a College of Advanced Education until 1989, then UWS Hawkesbury (as a member institution of UWS with campuses and Richmond and Quaker&#x27;s Hill) until 2000. The School of Agriculture operated a commercial dairy until it closed in 2004.

The Hawkesbury campus houses the Hawkesbury Forest Experiment. The experiment consists of twelve giant chambers with individual, living trees in controlled environments which will help predict what will happen to the Australian bush over the next century.

This campus is also home to the forensic science degree and holds a crime scene house, various forensic lab equipment. The Centre for Plant and Food Science is also located at this campus.

Hawkesbury Earthcare Centre, an organic farming organisation with a seedbank is located at Hawkesbury Campus. The centre is affiliated with Henry Doubleday Research and the Alternative Technology Association.

The Hawkesbury campus is next to Richmond TAFE. The nearest railway station is East Richmond

=== Penrith ===
The Penrith Campuses are made up of three areas in two Sydney suburbs; Kingswood, Werrington South and Werrington North.
Kingswood has most of the campus&#x27;s student services and facilities, computer rooms, classrooms and lecture theatres. It also has tennis courts, a gym, a bar (the Swamp Bar) and student accommodation. The Allen Library and Ward Library have now merged and are housed in a new building on the Kingswood campus. The new building (John Phillips Library) has been shortlisted for the 2015 World Architecture Festival (WAF) Awards.

Werrington South has fewer classrooms and lecture theatres. Werrington South also contains the faculty of communications, design and media. This is the campus for the Bachelor of Design (Visual Communications) degree. As of the end of 2016, these classes were no longer offered on this campus, can saw both the Design and Media arts subjects be relocated to Parramatta and the remaining classes be transferred to Kingswood. Majority of this site is now used for staff purposes.

Werrington North used to be a teaching campus but is now administration only, and houses the Chancellor and Vice Chancellor&#x27;s offices. It also has the Nepean Observatory built by Dr Graeme White (no longer with UWS) and members of the UWS Centre for Astronomy.

Focus areas are split between Werrington South and Kingswood, with most engineering, computing, music and humanities subjects having classes in Kingswood and design having classes at Werrington South.

Western Sydney University also hosts the broadcast centre of Sydney&#x27;s community television station TVS on Werrington South located in Building BD. As of 2015 TVS no longer broadcasts from this location due to the change of community licensing for stations ending in 2015. This change was made by then communications minister Malcolm Turnbull.

Western Sydney University hosts the radio broadcast centre of ABC Local Radio, ABC Radio National, ABC Classic FM, Triple J, ABC NewsRadio, ABC Dig Music, ABC Jazz, &amp; ABC Country from the Ultimo radio studios.

== Student life ==
=== Student unions ===
Prior to 2009, Western Sydney University had two student organisations, each with its own focus and areas of responsibility. These organisations voluntarily shut down operations in 2009. These organisations were responsible for the bulk of extracurricular activities and services provided by the university.

Each organisation previously sourced their funds from Compulsory Student Unionism fees. With the passage of Voluntary Student Unionism legislation, UWS agreed to fund the organisations, but at a substantially reduced level. UWSSA also asked students to pay a voluntary $60 fee.
UWSSA and PAUWS were independent of the university, while UWSConnect is wholly owned by UWS.

* UWSSA Inc. — UWS Students&#x27; Association. Its motto was &quot;Bringing life to knowledge &quot; – a twist on the university&#x27;s motto. It aimed to improve student life at the university by providing welfare and support services, and ran campaigns on issues affecting the student population.
* PAUWS Inc. — The Postgraduate Association of UWS was a student&#x27;s association for the postgraduate student population at the university.
*UWSConnect Ltd. — UWSConnect is a not-for-profit company owned by the university which aims to improve university life by providing bars, cafés, sporting events, recreational activities, etc. It is responsible for organising commercial ties with the university and its students, such as advertising space within the university, vending machines and student discounts and special offers. Connect Fitness — Connect Fitness is a not-for-profit organisation located on the grounds of Western Sydney University with four gyms now in operation over the Kingswood, Hawkesbury, Bankstown and Campbelltown campuses.
*SPORT. — In 1989 the first football club of the university was formed at the Kingswood campus competing against other unniversities in intervarsity competitions including in Canberra, Armidale and Melbourne. The captain Richard Bakoss led the team for the first three years.

In 2019 the university restructured student representation, with the Western Sydney University Student Representative Council (SRC) becoming the peak representative body for all enrolled students at Western Sydney University. The Council consists of 22 Representatives elected to represent the various campuses of Western Sydney University, Consisting of campus representative, collective officers, and the executive.

=== Student newspapers ===
&quot;WSUPnews&quot; is the student newspaper of the Western Sydney University. W&#x27;SUP was previously known as &quot;cruWsible&quot; which was established in 2013.

=== Student accommodation ===
Western Sydney University has on-campus accommodation in the form of the UWS Village located adjacent to its Parramatta Campus. The village was opened in February 2009, providing apartments from one to eight bedrooms. At the time of opening, the village was the third Campus Living Villages property to be established in Sydney after the Macquarie University Village and the Sydney University Village.

== Notable people ==
=== Academics and staff ===
The winner of the 2007 Miles Franklin Literary Award, Alexis Wright, was a UWS Postdoctoral Research Fellow in 2010.

In 2011, author Anita Heiss was Adjunct Associate Professor at the university, attached to the Badanami Centre for Indigenous Education (see below).

Award-winning Australian author Gail Jones was a professor in the university&#x27;s Writing and Society Research Centre .

In 2014, Peter K. Jonason, a postgraduate psychology professor at UWS with a PhD in psychology, won the Ig Nobel Prize for Psychology in 2014 for his research into the &quot;dark side&quot; of human nature completed in 2013 under the report titled &quot;Creatures of the Night: Chronotypes and the Dark Triad Traits&quot; (Peter K. Jonason, Amy Jones, and Minna Lyons, &quot;Personality and Individual Differences&quot;, vol. 55, no. 5, 2013, pp. 538–541).

== Controversies ==
=== Reports of on-campus sexual assault and harassment ===
Between 2011 and 2016, there were 28 officially reported cases of sexual abuse and harassment on campus, resulting in no expulsions, no suspensions, and 7 warnings. The 2017 Australian Human Rights Commission report on sexual assault and harassment gave figures substantially higher than this.

=== Complementary medicine ===
Early in 2016, some controversy surrounding the university&#x27;s full support of complementary medicine and the university&#x27;s alleged spying on employees who lodge complaints in good faith emerged in the press. An employee, as well as eminent scientists, criticised the support of the university for complementary medicines such as homeopathy, acupuncture, TCM, and energy healing etc. The main controversial aspect was the continued support of these pseudo-scientific fields in exchange for continued funding from the naturopathic Jacka Foundation of Natural Therapies.

The National Institute of Complementary Medicine (NICM), a part of Western Sydney University, won the Bent Spoon Award in November 2017. This award is bestowed by the Australian Skeptics to &#x27;the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudo-scientific piffle&#x27;. In early 2017, the university unsuccessfully attempted to block their Bent Spoon nomination. This led to a number of articles appearing in the media taking an in-depth look at the National Institute of Complementary Medicine. The university was found to have accepted an untied gift of $10 million from the controversial supplement company, Blackmores. These funds would partly be used to establish a traditional Chinese medicine &#x27;hospital&#x27; in Sydney&#x27;s health precinct, Westmead.

As it does in English, it can refer to either peace between two entities (especially between a person and God or between two countries), or to the well-being, welfare or safety of an individual or a group of individuals. The word shalom is also found in many other expressions and names. Its equivalent cognate in Arabic is &quot;salaam&quot;, &quot;sliem&quot; in Maltese, Shlama in Neo-Aramaic dialects, and &quot;sälam&quot; in Ethiopian Semitic languages from the Proto-Semitic root Š-L-M.

== Etymology ==

In Hebrew, words are built on &quot;roots&quot;, generally of three consonants. When the root consonants appear with various vowels and additional letters, a variety of words, often with some relation in meaning, can be formed from a single root. Thus from the root &quot;sh-l-m&quot; come the words &quot;shalom&quot; (&quot;peace, well-being&quot;), &quot;hishtalem&quot; (&quot;it was worth it&quot;), &quot;shulam&quot; (&quot;was paid for&quot;), &quot;meshulam&quot; (&quot;paid for in advance&quot;), &quot;mushlam&quot; (&quot;perfect&quot;), and &quot;shalem&quot; (&quot;whole&quot;).

Biblically, &quot;shalom&quot; is seen in reference to the well-being of others (Genesis 43:27, Exodus 4:18), to treaties (I Kings 5:12), and in prayer for the wellbeing of cities or nations (Psalm 122:6, Jeremiah 29:7).

The meaning of completeness, central to the term &quot;shalom&quot;, can also be confirmed in related terms found in other Semitic languages. The Assyrian term &quot;salamu&quot; means to be complete, unharmed, paid/atoned. &quot;Sulmu&quot;, another Assyrian term, means welfare. A closer relation to the idea of &quot;shalom&quot; as a concept and action is seen in the Arabic root &quot;salaam&quot;, meaning, among other things, to be safe, secure and forgiven.
== In expressions ==
The word &quot;shalom&quot; can be used for all parts of speech; as a noun, adjective, verb, adverb, and interjection. It categorizes all shaloms. The word &quot;shalom&quot; is used in a variety of expressions and contexts in Hebrew speech and writing:

* &quot;Shalom&quot; by itself is a very common abbreviation and it is used in Modern Israeli Hebrew as a greeting and farewell. In this way, it is similar to the Hawaiian &quot;aloha&quot;, the Korean , the Persian (), the Indian &quot;namaste&quot;, the Italian &quot;ciao&quot; and the Vietnamese (a false cognate of &quot;ciao&quot;; the two words are not linguistically related despite sounding similar to each other).
* &quot;Shalom aleichem&quot; (; &quot;well-being be upon you&quot; or &quot;may you be well&quot;), this expression is used to greet others and is a Hebrew equivalent of &quot;hello&quot;. The appropriate response to such a greeting is &quot;upon you be well-being&quot; ( עֲלֵיכֶם שָׁלוֹם, &quot;aleichem shalom&quot;). This is a cognate of the Arabic &quot;assalamu alaikum&quot;. On the eve of Shabbat, Jews have a custom of singing a song which is called Shalom Alecheim, before the Kiddush over wine of the Shabbat dinner is recited.
** In the Gospels, Jesus often uses the greeting &quot;Peace be unto you&quot; (e.g., Matthew 10:12), a translation of &quot;shalom aleichem&quot;. See Pax (liturgy).
* &quot;Shabbat shalom&quot; (; &quot;peaceful Sabbath&quot;) is a common greeting used on Shabbat. This is most prominent in areas with Mizrahi, Sephardi, or modern Israeli influence. Many Ashkenazi communities in the Jewish diaspora use Yiddish &quot;Gut shabbes&quot; in preference or interchangeably.
* &quot;Ma sh&#x27;lom&#x27;cha&quot; (; &quot;What is your well-being/peace?&quot;) is a Hebrew equivalent of the English &quot;how are you?&quot;. 
* &quot;Alav hashalom&quot; (; &quot;upon him is peace&quot;) is a phrase used in some Jewish communities, especially Ashkenazi ones, after mentioning the name of a deceased respected individual.
* &quot;Oseh shalom&quot; (עוֹשֶׂה שָׁלוֹם; &quot;Peace-Maker&quot;) is the part of a passage commonly found as a concluding sentence in much Jewish liturgy (including the &quot;birkat hamazon&quot;, &quot;kaddish&quot; and personal &quot;amidah&quot; prayers).

== Jewish religious principle ==
In Judaism, &quot;shalom&quot; is one of the underlying principles of the Torah: &quot;Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are shalom&quot;. The Talmud explains, &quot;The entire Torah is for the sake of the ways of shalom&quot;. Maimonides comments in his Mishneh Torah: &quot;Great is peace, as the whole Torah was given in order to promote peace in the world, as it is stated, &#x27;Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are peace.

In the book &quot;Not the Way It&#x27;s Supposed to Be: A Breviary of Sin&quot;, Christian author Cornelius Plantinga described the biblical concept of shalom:

The webbing together of God, humans, and all creation in justice, fulfillment, and delight is what the Hebrew prophets call shalom. We call it peace but it means far more than mere peace of mind or a cease-fire between enemies. In the Bible, shalom means universal flourishing, wholeness and delight – a rich state of affairs in which natural needs are satisfied and natural gifts fruitfully employed, a state of affairs that inspires joyful wonder as its Creator and Savior opens doors and welcomes the creatures in whom he delights. Shalom, in other words, is the way things ought to be.

== Use as name ==
=== Name for God ===
The Talmud says, &quot;the name of God is &#x27;Peace, therefore, one is not permitted to greet another with the word &#x27;shalom&#x27; in places such as a bathroom.

Biblical references lead some Christians to teach that &quot;Shalom&quot; is one of the sacred names of God.

=== Name for people ===
&quot;Shalom&quot; is also a Hebrew name, found commonly in Israel as both a given and family name. While traditionally masculine, it is occasionally androgynous, such as in the case of model Shalom Harlow.

<doc id="304180" wikidata="Q954186" url="?curid=304180" title="Campbelltown, New South Wales">
<text>Campbelltown is a suburb located on the outskirts of the metropolitan area of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is located in Greater Western Sydney south-west of the Sydney central business district by road. Campbelltown is the administrative seat of the local government area of the City of Campbelltown. It is also acknowledged on the register of the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales as one of only four cities within the Sydney metropolitan area.

Campbelltown gets its name from Elizabeth Campbell, the wife of former Governor of New South Wales Lachlan Macquarie. Originally called Campbell-Town, the name was later simplified to the current Campbelltown.

==History==
The area that later became Campbelltown was inhabited prior to European settlement by the Tharawal people. Not long after the arrival of the First Fleet in Sydney in 1788, a small herd of six cattle escaped and weren&#x27;t seen again by the British settlers for seven years. They were spotted, however, by the Tharawal people. In a rock art site called Bull Cave near Campbelltown, they drew a number of cattle with pronounced horns. The Tharawal described the cattle to British explorers and in 1795 the British found a herd of around 60 cattle grazing in the area now known as Camden.

The colonial administration was keen for the herd to establish itself so forbade killing of the cattle or settlement in the area. But John Macarthur, who wanted to establish sheep in the colony, took a liking to the prime grazing land. He convinced the British government to overrule the local administration and grant him just south of the Nepean River in 1805. Four years later a number of other grants were made to farmers between Camden and Liverpool.

The Tharawal initially worked with the local farmers but a drought in 1814 led to large numbers of neighbouring Gandangara people moving into the area in search of food. Tensions developed between the British and the Gandangara leading to skirmishes and a number of deaths on each side. Governor Macquarie felt a permanent settlement would lead to order in the area and so Campbell-Town was born in 1820.

===Town development===

Development of the town was slow particularly after the departure of Macquarie, and it wasn&#x27;t until 1831 that residents took possession of town land. However, it was during this period that Campbelltown&#x27;s most famous incident occurred. In 1826, local farmer Frederick Fisher disappeared. According to folklore, his ghost appeared sitting on a fence rail over a creek just south of the town and pointed to a site where his body was later found to be buried. In memory of the incident, the Fisher&#x27;s Ghost festival is held each November in Campbelltown.

Campbelltown&#x27;s population increased steadily in the decades following. The southern rail line was extended to Campbelltown in 1858, leading to further development, and in 1882, Campbelltown Council was established allowing municipal works to occur in earnest. Campbelltown became the first country town in New South Wales to have piped water in 1888 and in the period between the World Wars, a local power station was built to supply electricity to residents.

After World War II, Campbelltown, having been previously a relatively small rural township, became a focal point for suburban expansion as part of Sydney&#x27;s broader urban sprawl. The development of infrastructure and the availability of land in Campbelltown attracted families looking for affordable housing. New housing estates increased the significant population growth up until the 1970s. 

Campbelltown was designated in the early 1960s as a satellite city by the New South Wales Planning Authority, and a regional capital for the south west of Sydney. There was extensive building and population growth in the intervening time and the government set aside land surrounding the township for public and private housing and industry.

<doc id="304182" wikidata="Q725379" url="?curid=304182" title="Último Dragón">
<text>, better known by his ring name , is a Japanese professional wrestler currently signed to Dragon Gate, where he acts as an in-ring talent, trainer and senior advisor. In addition to having trained in Japan, Asai learned to wrestle in the &quot;lucha libre&quot; style while working in Mexico. He is credited with popularizing the &quot;Asai Moonsault&quot;.

On October 11, 1996, Asai won the J-Crown, a unification of eight lower weight division titles from various international promotions. At the time, he already held the NWA World Middleweight Championship; during this reign he also became the WCW Cruiserweight Champion, making him the most decorated wrestler in history. From December 29, 1996, through January 4, 1997, he concurrently held ten titles, a record which still stands. From 2013 until 2019, he competed primarily for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) as a freelancer. In 2019, he joined Dragon Gate as a senior advisor and wrestler.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early years (1987–1996)===

Asai trained in the New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) dojo in 1987, but was not drafted up by the promotion due to his small size. He moved to Mexico where he joined the Universal Wrestling Association and subsequently won the UWA World Welterweight Championship in 1988. In March 1990, he joined the Universal Wrestling Federation in Japan. He also competed in the Universal Lucha Libre promotion founded by his mentor Gran Hamada.

In 1991, he signed with the Mexican Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) promotion. In CMLL, he adopted the Último Dragón mask and persona. &quot;Último Dragón&quot;, which means &quot;Last Dragon&quot; in Spanish, was initially a gimmick that saw Asai claiming to be the last student taught by legendary martial artist Bruce Lee, whose nickname was &quot;The Dragon&quot;. The gimmick was later dropped, but the name remained. Late in 1992, Misteriosito was turned into &quot;Último Dragoncito&quot;, a Mini-Estrella version of Asai. During the same period, Asai also signed with the Japanese WAR promotion, and due to co-promoting, he was able to wrestle for NJPW. In Japan, he became IWGP Junior heavyweight champion twice, and in Mexico, he held various titles. In later years, he wrestled for AAA.

===World Championship Wrestling (1996–1998)===

Asai made his American debut for the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) promotion in August 1996 initially under the mistranslated name &quot;Ultimate Dragon&quot;. He was referred to by this name for over a year in WCW until they reverted to using his Spanish ring name. He quickly was pushed into the lime-light of the WCW Cruiserweight division with Sonny Onoo as his manager. He was instantly a heel based upon the fact he was Japanese and Onoo was his manager. He made his WCW pay-per view debut in 1996&#x27;s Hog Wild against Rey Misterio Jr. for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship but lost. He got back the win at WCW World War 3 when he returned to WCW as the J-Crown champion. He then feuded with Dean Malenko for the WCW Cruiserweight title which he won at Starrcade 1996.

Dragon later dropped the WCW Cruiserweight title back to Malenko but his stock was rising as he won the WCW World Television Championship from Prince Iaukea but lost it to Steven Regal. He then turned on Onoo and began a face run and (kayfabe) moved back to Mexico and regained the World Television title from Regal before losing to Alex Wright at Clash of the Champions XXXV. He would then win the WCW Cruiserweight title one last time from Eddie Guerrero, before losing the title on the first &quot;WCW Thunder&quot; to Juventud Guerrera. He then suffered an arm injury in 1998 that required surgery. The operation was botched, causing nerve damage. It was thought that this would force an end of his career and he announced his retirement in November.

===Toryumon (1997–2003)===
In 1997, Asai then became a trainer and founded the Último Dragón Gym, where he trained three classes of students, &quot;Toryumon Japan&quot;, &quot;Toryumon 2000 Project&quot; (T2P), and &quot;Toryumon X&quot;. His first class of students, which included Don Fuji, Dragon Kid, Magnum Tokyo, Cima and Suwa, worked for WCW early in their career. In 1998, Asai began co-promoting Grupo Internacional Revolución (IWRG) based out of Mexico, where he trained several of the top young wrestlers. In 1999, a promotion named Toryumon opened, with the vast majority of the roster having been trained by Asai. Toryumon was later renamed Dragon Gate as Asai parted ways with the promotion. He continued to train students at his gym.

In 2002, Asai underwent another surgery to repair the damage done to his arm in hopes of returning to wrestling. In late 2002 Ultimo Dragon was in talks with World Wrestling Entertainment for another shot at a United States run. To get back into ring shape he returned to action for his T2P and Toryumon Mexico promotions. On November 26, he teamed with former WCW wrestlers Norman Smiley and Perry Saturn in a win against Masaaki Mochizuki, Kenichiro Arai and Toru Owashi for T2P. On December 7 he teamed with Mochizuki and Dragon Kid in a win over the team of Bestia Salvaje, Scorpio Jr. and El Duende for Toryumon Mexico.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2003–2004)===
In the spring of 2003, he signed with World Wrestling Entertainment as the &quot;Último Dragón&quot;, seeking to realize his two lifelong goals of competing in Madison Square Garden and performing at WrestleMania. He was brought in on the heels of the signing of Rey Mysterio on the belief that he would make as big of an impact as Mysterio did upon his WWE debut. Asai made his WWE debut in dark match victories against Rico, Crash Holly and Shannon Moore as they debuted a series of video packages hyping the debut of Dragon on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. He made his WWE television debut at Madison Square Garden on June 26, 2003 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in a match with Shannon Moore, where he debuted his finisher, the Asai DDT (a standing shiranui), to the American wrestling audience.

Throughout the summer he competed in a tournament for the WWE United States Championship beating Jamie Noble but losing to eventual winner, Eddie Guerrero. He quickly rebounded by beating Kanyon in a &quot;WWE Heat&quot; match taped before Vengeance. He then wrestled on &quot;WWE Velocity&quot; for the next few weeks, leading to a match with Rey Mysterio on &quot;SmackDown&quot;. Dragon won the match only after Tajiri interfered and showed respect to Dragon due to their Japanese heritage. The next week Dragon teamed with Mysterio to take on Tajiri and Nunzio. After this match, he was not seen on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; for several months until the build for the Cruiserweight Open at WrestleMania XX. At the event, Dragon participated in the Open. Dragon&#x27;s WrestleMania resulted in one of WrestleMania&#x27;s most famous blunders, tripping as he entered the arena from the backstage area and tripping as he was going up the turnbuckle for a pose. The first trip was edited out of the WrestleMania XX DVD, but the second wasn&#x27;t. After the open, he faced Chavo Guerrero and Nunzio in his last WWE matches. On April 22, 2004, WWE announced that Asai asked for his release from WWE when he knew WWE wanted to unmask him and went back to Japan immediately.

===Return to Japan (2004–present)===
One month after being released from WWE, Asai quickly picked up a New Japan tour on May 1, 2004. He returned to Mexico by occasionally wrestling for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). He also took part in the short lived Japanese independent promotion Dragondoor, ran by one of his students Noriaki Kawabata using mostly T2P and Toryumon X graduates. He would wrestle in matches against Último Guerrero and various other stars who wrestled in Mexico or Japanese based lucha libre promotions. Since the fall of Dragondoor he went back to Mexico to run another class of the Toryumon school, which has led to some standouts in Hajime Ohara, Kazuchika Okada and Pequeño Ninja. The rest of the Toryumon students along with Asai joined the Tatsumi Fujinami promoted Dradition promotion in Japan. In 2006, Asai began promoting the annual &quot;Toryumon Mexico: Dragon Mania&quot; wrestling show. He also wrestled at UWA Hardcore Wrestling based outside of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He has wrestled against Sonjay Dutt, M-Dogg 20, Chris Sabin, Alex Shelley, Jyushin Thunder Liger and Black Tiger all in the UWA. Since then he has been working in Japan for various independent promotions such as Pro Wrestling Kageki and Michinoku Pro. He has also been to Mexico as well as in Spain, working for Nu Wrestling Evolution.

On December 15, 2013, Dragón defeated Yoshinobu Kanemaru to win All Japan Pro Wrestling&#x27;s World Junior Heavyweight Championship. He lost the title to Atsushi Aoki on May 29, 2014. On August 27, 2017, he regained the title by defeating Tajiri. On March 22, 2015, Dragón won another title in All Japan, when he and Kanemaru defeated Mitsuya Nagai and Takeshi Minamino for the All Asia Tag Team Championship. They vacated the title on October 14.

On August 30 and 31, 2014, Dragón participated in a show in Pyongyang, North Korea promoted by the Inoki Genome Federation. He defeated Hajime Ohara on the first day and Heddi French on the second in singles matches.

<text>Lanzarote (, , ) is a Spanish island, the easternmost of the Canary Islands, off the north coast of Africa and from the Iberian Peninsula. 

Covering , Lanzarote is the fourth-largest of the islands in the archipelago. With 163,230 inhabitants at the beginning of 2024, it is the third most populous Canary Island, after Tenerife and Gran Canaria. Located in the centre-west of the island is Timanfaya National Park, one of its main attractions. The island was declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO in 1993. The island&#x27;s capital is Arrecife, which lies on the eastern coastline. It is the smaller main island of the Province of Las Palmas.

The first recorded name for the island, given by Italian-Majorcan cartographer Angelino Dulcert, was &quot;Insula de Lanzarotus Marocelus&quot;, after the Genoese navigator Lancelotto Malocello, from which the modern name is derived. The island&#x27;s name in the native Guanche language was &quot;Tyterogaka&quot; or &quot;Tytheroygaka&quot;, which may mean &quot;one that is all ochre&quot; (referring to the island&#x27;s predominant colour).

==History==
Lanzarote is believed to have been the first Canary Island to be settled. The Phoenicians may have visited or settled there, though no material evidence survives. The first known record came from Roman author Pliny the Elder in the encyclopaedia &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; on an expedition to the Canary Islands. The names of the islands (then called &quot;Insulae Fortunatae&quot; or the &quot;Fortunate Isles&quot;) were recorded as &quot;Junonia&quot; (Fuerteventura), &quot;Canaria&quot; (Gran Canaria), &quot;Ninguaria&quot; (Tenerife), &quot;Junonia Major&quot; (La Palma), &quot;Pluvialia&quot; (El Hierro), and &quot;Capraria&quot; (La Gomera). Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, the two easternmost Canary Islands, were only mentioned as the archipelago of the &quot;purple islands&quot;. The Roman poet Lucan and the Greek astronomer and geographer Ptolemy gave their precise locations. It was settled by the Majos tribe of the Guanches. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, interaction with the Canary Islands is unrecorded before 999, when the Arabs arrived at the island which they dubbed &quot;al-Djezir al-Khalida&quot; (among other names).
In 1336, a ship arrived from Lisbon under the guidance of Genoese navigator Lancelotto Malocello, who used the alias &quot;Lanzarote da Framqua&quot;. A fort was later built in the area of Montaña de Guanapay near today&#x27;s Teguise. Castilian slaving expeditions in 1385 and 1393 seized hundreds of Guanches and sold them in Spain, initiating the slave trade in the islands. French explorer Jean de Béthencourt arrived in 1402, heading a private expedition under Castilian auspices. Bethencourt first visited the south of Lanzarote at Playas de Papagayo, and the French overran the island within a matter of months. The island lacked mountains and gorges to serve as hideouts for the remaining Guanche population, and so many Guanches were taken away as slaves that only 300 Guanche men were said to have remained.

At the southern end of the Yaiza municipality, the first European settlement in the Canary Islands appeared in 1402 in the area known as &quot;El Rubicón&quot;, where the conquest of the Archipelago began. In this place, the Cathedral of Saint Martial of Limoges was built. The cathedral was destroyed by English pirates in the 16th century. A diocese was moved in 1483 to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Roman Catholic Diocese of Canarias). In 1404, the Castilians (with the support of the King of Castile) came and fought the local Guanches, who were further decimated. The islands of Fuerteventura and El Hierro were later similarly conquered. In 1477, a decision by the royal council of Castile confirmed a grant of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, with the smaller islands of Ferro and Gomera to the Castilian nobles Herrera, who held their fief until the end of the 18th century. In 1586, the Ottoman admiral Murat Reis temporarily seized Lanzarote. In the 17th century, pirates raided the island and took 1,000 inhabitants into slavery in Cueva de los Verdes.

Lanzarote and Fuerteventura would be the main exporters of wheat and cereals to the central islands of the archipelago during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries; Tenerife and Gran Canaria. Although this trade was almost never reversed for the inhabitants of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura (due to the fact that the landowners of these islands profited from this activity), producing periods of famine, so the population of these islands had to travel to Tenerife and Gran Canaria. The island of Tenerife is a major focus of attraction for the inhabitants of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, hence the feeling of union that has always existed in the popular sphere with Tenerife.

From 1730 to 1736, the island was hit by a series of volcanic eruptions, producing 32 new volcanoes in a stretch of . The priest of Yaiza, Don Andrés Lorenzo Curbelo, documented the eruption in detail until 1731. Lava covered a quarter of the island&#x27;s surface, including the most fertile soil and 11 villages. 100 smaller volcanoes were located in the area called &quot;Montañas del Fuego&quot;, the &quot;Mountains of Fire&quot;. In 1768, drought affected the deforested island, and winter rains did not fall. Much of the population was forced to emigrate to Cuba and the Americas, including a group which formed a significant addition to the Spanish settlers in Texas at San Antonio de Bexar in 1731.

In 1927, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura became part of the province of Las Palmas. Several archaeological expeditions have uncovered the prehistoric settlement at the archaeologic site of &quot;El Bebedero&quot; in the village of Teguise. In one of those expeditions, by a team from the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and a team from the University of Zaragoza, yielded about 100 Roman potsherds, nine pieces of metal, and one piece of glass. The artefacts were found in strata dated between the 1st and 4th centuries. They show that Romans did trade with the Canarians, though there is no evidence of settlements.

The island has a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve protected site status. According to a report in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, this status was endangered by a local corruption scandal. Since May 2009, police have arrested the former president of Lanzarote, the former mayor of Arrecife and more than 20 politicians and businessmen in connection with illegal building permits along Lanzarote&#x27;s coastline. UNESCO has threatened to revoke Lanzarote&#x27;s Biosphere Reserve status, &quot;if the developments are not respecting local needs and are impacting on the environment&quot;. The President of the Cabildo of Lanzarote denied &quot;any threat to Lanzarote&#x27;s UNESCO status&quot;.

==Geography==
Lanzarote is located north-east of Fuerteventura and just over from La Graciosa. The dimensions of the island are from north to south and from west to east. Lanzarote has of coastline, of which are sand, are beach, and the remainder is rocky. Its landscape includes the mountain ranges of Famara () in the north and Ajaches () to the south. South of the Famara massif is the El Jable desert, which separates Famara and Montañas del Fuego. The highest peak is Peñas del Chache, rising to above sea level. The &quot;Tunnel of Atlantis&quot;, the largest underwater volcanic tunnel in the world, is part of the Cueva de los Verdes lava tube.

===Climate===
Often called the &quot;Island of Eternal Spring&quot;, Lanzarote has a tropical hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;) according to the Köppen climatic classification. The small amount of precipitation is mainly concentrated in the winter. Rainfall during summer is a rare phenomenon and very often summers are completely dry without any precipitation. On average the island receives approximately 16 days of precipitation between December and February. Sometimes, the hot sirocco wind prevails, causing dry and dusty conditions across the island. Average precipitation in June and August is less than .

==Geology==
Lanzarote is the northernmost and easternmost island of the main Canary Islands and has a volcanic origin. The island emerged about 15 million years ago as product of the Canary hotspot. The island, along with others, emerged after the breakup of the African and the American continental plates. The greatest recorded eruptions occurred between 1730 and 1736 in the area now designated Timanfaya National Park.

==Biodiversity==
===Flora===
There are five hundred different kinds of plants on the island, of which 17 species are endemic. These plants have adapted to the relative scarcity of water in the same way as succulents. They include the Canary Island date palm (&quot;Phoenix canariensis&quot;), which is found in damper areas of the north, the Canary Island pine (&quot;Pinus canariensis&quot;), ferns, and wild olive trees (&quot;Olea europaea&quot;). &quot;Laurisilva&quot; trees, which once covered the highest parts of Risco de Famara, are rarely found today. After winter rainfall, the vegetation comes to a colourful bloom between February and March.

The vineyards of La Gería, Lanzarote &quot;DO&quot; wine region, are a protected area. Single vines are planted in pits wide and deep, with small stone walls around each pit. This agricultural technique is designed to harvest rainfall and overnight dew and to protect the plants from the winds.

===Fungi===
There are 180 different species of lichen-forming fungi. These survive in the suitable areas like rock surfaces, and promote weathering.

===Fauna===

Apart from the native bats and the mammals which accompanied humans to the island (including the dromedary, which was used for agriculture and is now a tourist attraction), there are few vertebrate species on Lanzarote. These include birds (such as falcons) and reptiles. Some interesting endemic animals are the &quot;Gallotia&quot; lizards and the blind &quot;Munidopsis polymorpha&quot; crabs found in the Jameos del Agua lagoon, which was formed by a volcanic eruption. The island is also home to one of two surviving populations of the threatened Canarian Egyptian vulture.

==Transport==
===Air===
The island&#x27;s main point of entry is César Manrique-Lanzarote Airport which, in 2018, handled passengers. It was renamed in 2019 to include the name of local artist César Manrique, in honour of the legacy he left behind on the island and coinciding with the centenary of his birth. The airport has two passenger terminal buildings, T1 and T2, with T2 being used exclusively for inter-island flights to and from the other Canary Islands. These inter-island flights are operated by regional airlines Binter Canarias and Canaryfly. Lanzarote Airport is located about southwest of the island&#x27;s capital, Arrecife, to which it is connected by the LZ-2 road.

===Sea===
Most of the goods arrive by sea through the Port of Arrecife, Puerto de los Mármoles. This port is also used by cruise ships. There are regular ferry lines that connect the Port of Arrecife with Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Cadiz.

Ferry services to the neighbouring island of Fuerteventura depart from Playa Blanca, the island&#x27;s southernmost town. Ferries to the island of La Graciosa depart from Órzola, Lanzarote&#x27;s northernmost town. The two main companies operating these services are Fred Olsen Express and Naviera Armas.

===Road===
The LZ-1 road connects the capital, Arrecife, to the northernmost town of Órzola. The LZ-2 road connects Arrecife to the southernmost town of Playa Blanca. LZ-3 is a highway that acts as a ring road around Arrecife, connecting Puerto de los Mármoles on the northern side of the city to LZ-2 on the southern side. These three roads form the island&#x27;s central road axis from which other roads connect to the rest of the island&#x27;s towns, settlements and points of interest.

Public transport on the island is provided by Arrecife Bus, operating under the name of Intercity Bus Lanzarote. The company operates 30 bus lines connecting the island&#x27;s major and minor settlements, as well as serving the airport, and includes internal bus services in the towns of Playa Blanca, San Bartolomé and Tías. Most lines begin or end in the capital, Arrecife. The public bus service within the city of Arrecife is provided by the local council and consists of five lines, including one to the neighbouring town of Playa Honda.

<doc id="304187" wikidata="Q612410" url="?curid=304187" title="C. Vann Woodward">
<text>Comer Vann Woodward (November 13, 1908 – December 17, 1999) was an American historian who focused primarily on the American South and race relations. He was long a supporter of the approach of Charles A. Beard, stressing the influence of unseen economic motivations in politics.

Woodward was on the left end of the history profession in the 1930s. By the 1950s he was a leading liberal and supporter of civil rights. His book &quot;The Strange Career of Jim Crow&quot; demonstrated that racial segregation was an invention of the late 19th century rather than an inevitable post-Civil-War development. After attacks on him by the New Left in the late 1960s, he moved to the right politically. He won a Pulitzer Prize for History for his annotated edition of Mary Chestnut&#x27;s Civil War diaries.

==Early life and education==
C. Vann Woodward was born in Vanndale, Arkansas, a town named after his mother&#x27;s family and the county seat from 1886 to 1903. It was in Cross County in eastern Arkansas. Woodward attended high school in Morrilton, Arkansas. He attended Henderson-Brown College, a small Methodist school in Arkadelphia, for two years. In 1930, he transferred to Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, where his uncle was dean of students and professor of sociology. After graduating, he taught English composition for two years at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. There he met Will W. Alexander, head of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation, and J. Saunders Redding, a historian at Atlanta University.

Woodward enrolled in graduate school at Columbia University in 1931 and received his M.A. from that institution in 1932. In New York, Woodward met, and was influenced by, W. E. B. Du Bois, Langston Hughes, and other figures who were associated with the Harlem Renaissance movement. After receiving his master&#x27;s degree in 1932, Woodward worked for the defense of Angelo Herndon, a young African-American Communist Party member who had been accused of subversive activities. He also traveled to the Soviet Union and Germany in 1932.

He did graduate work in history and sociology at the University of North Carolina. He was granted a Ph.D. in history in 1937, using as his dissertation the manuscript he had already finished on Thomas E. Watson. Woodward&#x27;s dissertation director was Howard K. Beale, a Reconstruction specialist who promoted the Beardian economic interpretation of history that deemphasized ideology and ideas and stressed material self-interest as a motivating factor.

In World War II, Woodward served in the Navy, assigned to write the history of major battles. His &quot;The Battle for Leyte Gulf&quot; (1947) became the standard study of the largest naval battle in history.

==Career==
Woodward, starting out on the left politically, wanted to use history to explore dissent. He approached W. E. B. Du Bois about writing about him, and thought of following his biography of Watson with one of Eugene V. Debs. He picked Georgia politician Tom Watson, who in the 1890s was a populist leader focusing the anger and hatred of poor whites against the establishment, banks, railroads and businessmen. Watson in 1908 was the presidential candidate of the Populist Party, but this time was the leader in mobilizing the hatred of the same poor whites against blacks, and a promoter of lynching.

===&quot;The Strange Career of Jim Crow&quot;===
Woodward&#x27;s most influential book was &quot;The Strange Career of Jim Crow&quot; (1955), which explained that segregation was a relatively late development and was not inevitable. After the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, in spring 1954, Woodward gave the Richards Lectures at the University of Virginia. The lectures were published in 1955 as &quot;The Strange Career of Jim Crow&quot;. Popular myth holds that Martin Luther King Jr. called &quot;The Strange Career&quot; &quot;the historical Bible of the Civil Rights Movement&quot; in a speech at Montgomery, Alabama on March 23, 1956, though he did not do so; he did cite the book and aver that it proved racial segregation was &quot;a political stratagem&quot;, in King&#x27;s words, and not a natural state of American society. It reached a large popular audience and helped shape the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.

Jim Crow laws, Woodward argued, were not part of the immediate aftermath of Reconstruction; they came later and were not inevitable. Following the Compromise of 1877, into the 1880s there were localized informal practices of racial separation in some areas of society along with what he termed &quot;forgotten alternatives&quot; in others. Finally the 1890s saw white southerners &quot;capitulate to racism&quot; to create &quot;legally prescribed, rigidly enforced, state-wide Jim Crowism.&quot;

===&quot;Origins of the New South, 1877–1913&quot;===
&quot;Origins of the New South, 1877–1913&quot; was published in 1951 by Louisiana State University Press as multivolume history of the South. It combined the Beardian theme of economic forces shaping history and the Faulknerian tone of tragedy and decline. He insisted on the discontinuity of the era and rejected both the romantic antebellum popular images of the Lost Cause school and the overoptimistic business boosterism of the New South Creed. Sheldon Hackney, a Woodward student, hailed the book.

===Appointments, teaching and awards===
Woodward was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958 and the American Philosophical Society in 1959.

Woodward taught at Johns Hopkins University from 1946 to 1961. He became Sterling Professor of History at Yale from 1961 to 1977, where he taught both graduate students and undergraduates. He did much writing but little original research at Yale, frequently writing essays for such outlets as the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;. He directed 25 PhD dissertations, including those by
* John W. Blassingame, former chair of the African American studies program at Yale;
* James M. McPherson, Professor of History at Princeton University;
* J. Morgan Kousser, Professor of History at California Institute of Technology
* J. Mills Thornton, Professor of History at University of Michigan
* Patricia Nelson Limerick, Professor of History at the University of Colorado at Boulder;
* Lawrence N. Powell, Professor of History at Tulane University
* Michel Wayne, Professor of History at the University of Toronto;
* Steven Hahn, Professor of History at the New York University;
* John Herbert Roper, Richardson Chair of American History at Emory &amp; Henry College;
* Barbara Fields, Professor of History at Columbia University.

In 1974, the United States House Committee on the Judiciary asked Woodward for an historical study of misconduct in previous administrations and how the Presidents responded. Woodward led a group of fourteen historians, and they produced a 400-page report in less than four months, &quot;Responses of the Presidents to Charges of Misconduct&quot;.

In 1978, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected Woodward for the Jefferson Lecture, the federal government&#x27;s highest honor for achievement in the humanities. His lecture, entitled &quot;The European Vision of America&quot;, was later incorporated into his book &quot;The Old World&#x27;s New World.&quot;

Woodward won the Pulitzer Prize in 1982 for &quot;Mary Chesnut&#x27;s Civil War&quot;, an edited version of Mary Chesnut&#x27;s Civil War diary. He won the Bancroft Prize for &quot;Origins of the New South&quot;.

==Move to the right==
Peter Novick stated, &quot;Vann Woodward was always very conflicted about the &#x27;presentism&#x27; of his work. He alternated between denying it, qualifying it, and apologizing for it.&quot; The British historian Michael O&#x27;Brien, the editor of Woodward&#x27;s letters in 2013, says that by the 1970s

He became greatly troubled by the rise of the black power movement, disliked affirmative action, never came to grips with feminism, mistrusted what came to be known as &quot;theory,&quot; and became a strong opponent of multiculturalism and &quot;political correctness.&quot;

In 1969, as president of the American Historical Association, Woodward led the fight to defeat a proposal by New Left historians to politicize the organization. He wrote his daughter afterwards, &quot;The preparations paid off and I had pretty well second-guessed the Rads on every turn.&quot;

In 1975–76 Woodward led the unsuccessful fight at Yale to block the temporary appointment of the communist historian Herbert Aptheker to teach a course. Radicals denounced his actions but a joint committee of the Organization of American Historians and the American Historical Association exonerated the process and found that there was no evidence that political criteria had been used. In 1987 he joined the conservative scholars who made up the National Association of Scholars, a group that explicitly opposes the academic left. Woodward wrote a favorable review in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; of Dinesh D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s &quot;Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus.&quot; It said that Duke University used racial criteria when it hired John Hope Franklin, who publicly feuded with Woodward. Hackney stated, &quot;Woodward became an open critic of political correctness and in other ways appeared to have shifted his seat at the political table.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
C. Vann Woodward died December 17, 1999, in Hamden, Connecticut, at the age of 91.

Woodward cautioned that the academicians had themselves abdicated their role as storytellers:Professionals do well to apply the term &quot;amateur&quot; with caution to the historian outside their ranks. The word does have deprecatory and patronizing connotations that occasionally backfire. This is especially true of narrative history, which nonprofessionals have all but taken over. The gradual withering of the narrative impulse in favor of the analytical urge among professional academic historians has resulted in a virtual abdication of the oldest and most honored role of the historian, that of storyteller. Having abdicated... the professional is in a poor position to patronize amateurs who fulfill the needed function he has abandoned.

The Southern Historical Association has established the &quot;C. Vann Woodward Dissertation Prize&quot;, awarded annually to the best dissertation on Southern history. There is a &quot;Peter V. and C. Vann Woodward Chair of History&quot; at Yale; it is now held by southern historian Glenda Gilmore. (Peter was Woodward&#x27;s son, who died at the age of 26 in 1969.)

He was a Charter member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers.

<text>The Valles Caldera (or Jemez Caldera) is a wide volcanic caldera in the Jemez Mountains of northern New Mexico. Hot springs, streams, fumaroles, natural gas seeps, and volcanic domes dot the caldera landscape. The highest point in the caldera is Redondo Peak, an resurgent lava dome located entirely within the caldera and surrounded by moat-like flows of rhyolitic solidified lavas. Located within the caldera are several grass valleys, or &quot;valles&quot;, the largest of which is Valle Grande ( ), the only one accessible by a paved road. In 1975, Valles Caldera was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service with much of the caldera being within the Valles Caldera National Preserve, a unit of the National Park System. The area has a varied history involving cultural significance, economic resources, scientific studies, and complex geological setting.

==History==
Use of Valles Caldera dates back to prehistoric times: spear points dating to 11,000 years ago have been discovered. Several Native American tribes frequented the caldera for hunting prolific game and gathering obsidian that is common in this area. The obsidian was knapped into tools and weapons while wild game was followed and hunted seasonally. Obsidian from the caldera was traded by tribes across much of the Southwest. Eventually, the Spanish, and later Mexican settlers along with the Navajo and other tribes came to the caldera seasonally for grazing livestock. This often resulted in periodic clashes and raids between tribes and cultures. Later, as the United States acquired New Mexico as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, the caldera became the backdrop for the Indian wars with the U.S. Army. Around the same time, the caldera and its forests began to be used commercially for ranching and logging.

===Baca Ranch===
The caldera became part of the Baca Ranch in 1876. The Bacas were a wealthy family given the land as compensation for the termination of a grant given to their family near Las Vegas, in northeastern New Mexico. The family was given four other parcels by the US Government as well, another one in New Mexico, one in Colorado, and two in Arizona. This area, , was called &quot;Baca Location Number One&quot; or &quot;Baca Float Number One.&quot; Since then, the land has been through a string of exchanges between private owners and business enterprises. Most notably, it was owned by Frank Bond in the 1930s. Bond, a businessman based in nearby Española, ran up to 30,000 sheep in the caldera, significantly overgrazing the land and causing damage from which the watersheds of the landscape are still recovering.

The land was purchased by the Dunigan family from Abilene, Texas in 1963. Pat Dunigan did not obtain the timber rights, however, and the New Mexico Lumber Company logged the property heavily - removing significant amounts of old-growth douglas fir and ponderosa pine. Dunigan bought out the timber rights in the 1970s and slowed the logging. He negotiated unsuccessfully with the National Park Service and the US Forest Service for possible sale of the property in the 1980s.
===Valles Caldera National Preserve===
The Valles Caldera Preservation Act of 2000 signed by President Clinton on July 25, 2000, created the Valles Caldera National Preserve (VCNP). The legislation provided for the federal purchase of this historical ranch with funds coming from the Land and Water Conservation Fund derived from royalties the US government receives from offshore petroleum and natural gas drilling. The Dunigan family sold the entire surface estate of and seven-eighths of the geothermal mineral estate to the federal government for $101 million. As some sites of the Baca Ranch are sacred and of cultural significance to the Native Americans, of the purchase were obtained by the Santa Clara Pueblo, which borders the property to the northeast. These include the headwaters of Santa Clara Creek, which is sacred to the pueblo. On the southwest corner of the land, were to be ceded to Bandelier National Monument.

The Baca Ranch, also known as Baca Location No. 1, had possessed a mixed range of tree species and significant biodiversity. At the time of the purchase, the ranch was home to of pristine trout streams, of conifer forest, 17 endangered plant and animal species, and of grassland grazed by 8,000 elk, New Mexico&#x27;s largest herd. The preserve is encircled by federal lands, including the Santa Fe National Forest, the Jemez National Recreation Area, and Bandelier National Monument.

The Valles Caldera Preservation Act of 2000 also created the Valles Caldera Trust, an experimental management organization consisting of nine board members, including seven appointed by the President of the United States. The Trust combined private-sector practices with federal land management protocol. Under the terms of the Valles Caldera Preservation Act, the preserve was to become financially self-sustaining by 2015. The experiment was controversial. In 2010, the Trust admitted that it would be unable to achieve financial self-sustainability, having raised only about $850,000 of the $3 million needed to manage the property each year.

Environmentalists lobbied for the more inclusive protections of national park status instead of the Trust model, but then-Senator Pete Domenici (R) insisted on the experimental approach as a condition for his support for public purchase. Beginning in 2010, US Senator Jeff Bingaman (D) introduced legislation that would transfer the property to the National Park Service as a national preserve. The 2011 bill was supported by the VCNP trustees and a majority of New Mexico&#x27;s Congressional delegation. On December 19, 2014, President Barack Obama signed the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, which transferred administrative jurisdiction of the preserve from the Valles Caldera Trust to the National Park Service. After a brief transition period, the National Park Service assumed day-to-day management on October 1, 2015. On October 10, the preserve held an official dedication with dignitaries including U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, U.S. Senator Tom Udall, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich, former U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman, National Park Service Intermountain Region Director Sue Masica, and the first National Park Service Superintendent of Valles Caldera National Preserve, Jorge Silva-Bañuelos.

=== Las Conchas Fire ===
In July 2011, the Las Conchas Fire, started by a power line on nearby private land, burned of the Valles Caldera National Preserve. The wildfire burned a total of in the Jemez Mountains, including most of neighboring Bandelier National Monument. The Jemez Mountains and surrounding areas of the southwest incorporate dry climates, grasslands, and certain tree species (like Pinon) that evolved to exist with wildfires. Changes in climate and anthropogenic interference with the fire cycle and habitats, has led to fires that are hotter and more intense. These types of fires are more difficult for ecosystems to recover from.

==Geoscience ==

The circular topographic rim of the caldera measures in diameter. The caldera and surrounding volcanic structures are one of the most thoroughly studied caldera complexes in the United States. Research studies have focused on the fundamental processes of magmatism, hydrothermal systems, ore deposition, and glassy rhyolites. Nearly 40 deep cores have been examined, resulting in extensive subsurface data and geothermal information.

Valles Caldera is the younger of two calderas known at this location, having collapsed over and buried the older Toledo Caldera, which in turn may have collapsed over yet older calderas. The associated Cerros del Rio volcanic field, which forms the eastern Pajarito Plateau and the Caja del Rio, is older than the Toledo Caldera. The Toledo and Valles Calderas formed during eruptions 1.61 million and 1.25 million years ago, respectively. The caldera-forming Toledo eruption emplaced the Otowi member of the Bandelier Tuff 1.61 million years ago, which can be seen along canyon walls west of Valles Caldera, including San Diego Canyon. The younger Tshirege Member of the Bandelier Tuff was formed during the Valles Caldera eruption 1.23 million years ago. The now eroded and exposed orange-tan, light-colored Bandelier Tuff from these events creates the stunning mesas of the Pajarito Plateau.

Caldera is the type locality for a resurgent dome caldera, the formation of which was first developed by C.S. Ross, R.L. Smith, and R.A. Bailey during field work at Valles in the 1960s. This type locality and associated studies have been used to studied other resurgent domes around the world, including Yellowstone Caldera. After the initial caldera-forming eruption at Valles, the Redondo Peak resurgent dome was uplifted beginning around 1.2 million years ago. Minor eruptions of moat rhyolitic flows occurred from approximately 1.16 million years ago at Cerro del Medio to 0.07 million years ago at Banco Bonito, along a structural ring fracture zone. The El Cajete Pumice and Battleship Rock Ignimbrite were emplaced in a single eruptive event 74,200 ± 1,100 years ago, followed by the eruption of the Banco Bonito obsidian flow during the youngest eruption of Valles Caldera, at 68,900 ± 1,000 years ago. The caldera and surrounding area continue to be shaped by ongoing volcanic activity. Seismic investigations show that a low-velocity zone lies beneath the caldera, suggesting the presence of partial melt within a remaining magma chamber at between 5 and 15 km depth. An active geothermal system with hot springs and fumaroles exists today. These calderas and associated volcanic structures lie within the Jemez Volcanic Field. This volcanic field lies at the intersection of the Rio Grande Rift, which runs north–south through New Mexico, and the Jemez Lineament, which extends from southeastern Arizona northeast to western Oklahoma. The volcanic activity here is related to the tectonic movements of this intersection.

NASA used the caldera in October to November 1964 and again in September 1966 to geologically train the Apollo Astronauts in recognizing volcanic features, such as ash flow tuffs, pumice air falls, and rhyolite domes. Notable geologist instructors included Roy Bailey.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Valles Caldera has a subarctic climate (Dfc), with cold winters and mild summers. The caldera is subject to strong temperature inversions, causing very cold nights year round and high diurnal temperature variation.


==Geothermal energy source potential==
The volcanic properties of Valles Caldera make it a likely source for renewable geothermal energy. However, some people oppose the development of geothermal energy, considering it destructive to the scenic beauty, recreational and grazing use. Its impact on the hot springs and supplying aquifers is unknown as experiences from other past geothermal projects proved that production of reservoir fluids had dramatic impacts to the surface thermal features.

Valles caldera was home to the first experiments into development of an Enhanced geothermal system (EGS) or Hot-dry-rock (HDR) geothermal system, beginning in 1974 by the Los Alamos National Laboratory at the Fenton Hill reservoir, approximately 3 km west of Valles caldera. Originally, the Fenton Hill site was chosen as an EGS laboratory in hopes that the proximity to Valles caldera would increase the temperature of the bedrock, thus requiring shallower drill depths. However, the abundance of hydrothermal fluids discharged from the nearby caldera resulted in hydrothermal alteration of the rocks at depth, weakening the sealed nature of the reservoir. The Fenton Hill HDR experiment was finally abandoned in 1998. The experiments demonstrated that a potential EGS reservoir must be characterized by low permeability, crystalline basement rock with no active faults or joints.

From 1959 to 1983, approximately 40 exploratory geothermal wells were drilled into the Redondo Creek Graben as part of the Baca geothermal field, a joint operation by the United States Department of Energy and the Union Oil Company of California. Despite measuring a maximum temperature of 342 °C and having a likely production capacity of 20 MWe, the geothermal field was too small to be economic. Three scientific cores were drilled in Valles Caldera during the mid-1980s as part of the United States Continental Scientific Drilling Program in order to analyze the chemistry of geothermal fluids and the presence of a vapor-dominated cap in the Sulphur Springs region. The maximum bottom hole temperature measured during drilling was 295 °C. Overall, the geothermal reservoir at Valles Caldera is liquid-dominated rather than vapor-dominated and has a neutral-chloride fluid chemistry with a maximum temperature below 300 °C.

==Recreation==

A number of recreational and/or historical uses take place in Valles Caldera. Many of these uses involve trails. Over two dozen official hiking and biking trails of varying length are available. Maps and trail descriptions may be found in &quot;Hiking Trails in Valles Caldera National Preserve,&quot; by Coco Rae. Valles Caldera has many miles of ranch roads, livestock and game trails. These include a network of trails currently designated for horse riding. Historically, Valles Caldera was a location for equestrian endurance races. After establishment of VCNP, the first race in the caldera was held in 2009. The largest grass valley, Valle Grande, is a venue for ski orienteering. Activities are open to the public, though some require reservations. Customer service and concierge services are provided by the Public Lands Interpretive Association. The valley floor is above altitude.

== Wildlife and livestock ==

Throughout the caldera, the grass valleys appear groomed: there are few saplings and mature trees lack lower branches. This is due to heavy by and and because of frequent grass fires of human and natural origin which kill the lower branches on the Engelmann spruce, Douglas-fir and Ponderosa pine that populate the uplands around the lower-elevation Montane grasslands dominating the bottoms of the calderas. The grasslands were native perennial bunch grass maintained by frequent fire before sheep and cattle grazing. Although the grass appears abundant, it is a limited resource and its growing season is short. Through the VCNP&#x27;s limited grazing program, it feeds hundreds of cattle in the summer and thousands more of elk in the warm seasons, in drought winters, and during most of the year. The nutritional value of the bunch grasses is considered low or poor quality. Other wildlife that inhabits the area are Golden Eagles, striped Badgers, and the Gunnison Prairie Dog, to name a few. The National Park Service states that elk population in Valles Caldera is the second largest herd in New Mexico. Hunting is permitted within the National Preserve under certain restrictions and times of the year.

==In popular culture ==
Valles Caldera has provided several filming locations, most for films in the Western genre. Some of these locations include exterior sets, such as the weathered &quot;ranch house&quot; that can be seen from the highway in Valle Grande, and a small &quot;town&quot;.

<doc id="304197" wikidata="Q11141137" url="?curid=304197" title="Midshipman">
<text>A midshipman is an officer of the lowest rank in the Royal Navy, United States Navy, and many Commonwealth navies. Commonwealth countries which use the rank include Canada (Naval Cadet), Australia, Bangladesh, Namibia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Kenya.

In the 17th century, a midshipman was a rating for an experienced seaman, and the word derives from the area aboard a ship, amidships, either where he worked on the ship, or where he was berthed. Beginning in the 18th century, a commissioned officer candidate was rated as a midshipman, and the seaman rating began to slowly die out. By the Napoleonic era (1793–1815), a midshipman was an apprentice officer who had at least nominally served at least three years as a volunteer, officer&#x27;s servant or able seaman, and was roughly equivalent to a present-day petty officer in rank and responsibilities. After serving at least three years as a midshipman or master&#x27;s mate, he was eligible to take the examination for lieutenant. Promotion to lieutenant was not automatic, and many midshipmen took positions as master&#x27;s mates for an increase in pay and responsibility aboard ship. Midshipmen in the United States Navy were trained and served similarly to midshipmen in the Royal Navy, although unlike their counterparts in the Royal Navy, a midshipman was a warrant officer rank until 1912.

During the 19th century, changes in the training of naval officers in both the Royal Navy and the United States Navy led to the replacement of apprenticeship aboard ships with formal schooling in a naval college. Midshipman began to mean an officer cadet at a naval college. Trainees now spent around four years in a college and two years at sea prior to promotion to commissioned officer rank. Between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries, time at sea declined to less than a year as the entry age was increased from 12 to 18.

Ranks equivalent to midshipman exist in many other navies. Using US midshipman or pre-fleet board UK midshipman as the basis for comparison, the equivalent rank would be a naval cadet in training to become a junior commissioned officer. Using post-fleet board UK midshipman for comparison, the rank would be the most junior commissioned officer in the rank structure, and similar to a US ensign in role and responsibility. In many Romance languages, the literal translation of the local term for &quot;midshipman&quot; into English is &quot;Navy Guard&quot;, including the French &quot;garde marine&quot;, Spanish &quot;guardia marina&quot;, Portuguese &quot;guarda-marinha&quot;, and Italian &quot;guardiamarina&quot;. Today, these ranks all refer to naval cadets, but historically they were selected by the monarchy, and were trained mostly on land as soldiers.

==History==

===Apprentice officers===

====Royal Navy (1662–1836)====

=====Origins=====

The rank of midshipman originated during the Tudor and Stuart eras, and originally referred to a post for an experienced seaman promoted from the ordinary deck hands, who worked in between the main and mizzen masts and had more responsibility than an ordinary seaman, but was not a military officer or an officer in training. The first published use of the term midshipman was in 1662. The word derives from an area aboard a ship, amidships, but it refers either to the location where midshipmen worked on the ship, or the location where midshipmen were berthed.

By the 18th century, four types of midshipman existed: midshipman (original rating), midshipman extraordinary, midshipman (apprentice officer), and midshipman ordinary. Some midshipmen were older men, and while most were officer candidates who failed to pass the lieutenant examination or were passed over for promotion, some members of the original rating served, as late as 1822, alongside apprentice officers without themselves aspiring to a commission. By 1794, all midshipmen were considered officer candidates, and the original rating was phased out.

=====Entry=====

Beginning in 1661, boys who aspired to become officers were sent by their families to serve on ships with a &quot;letter of service&quot; from the crown, and were paid at the same rate as midshipmen. The letter instructed the admirals and captains that the bearer was to be shown &quot;such kindness as you shall judge fit for a gentleman, both in accommodating him in your ship and in furthering his improvement&quot;. Their official rating was volunteer-per-order, but they were often known as King&#x27;s letter boys, to distinguish their higher social class from the original midshipman rating.

Beginning in 1677, Royal Navy regulations for promotion to lieutenant required service as a midshipman, and promotion to midshipman required some time at sea. By the Napoleonic era, the regulations required at least three years of services as a midshipman or master&#x27;s mate and six years of total sea time. Sea time was earned in various ways, most boys served this period at sea in any lower rating, either as a servant of one of the ship&#x27;s officers, a volunteer, or a seaman.

By the 1730s, the rating volunteer-per-order was phased out and replaced with a system where prospective midshipmen served as servants for officers. For example, a captain was allowed four servants for every 100 men aboard his ship; many of these servants were young men destined to become officers.

In 1729, the Royal Naval Academy in Portsmouth – renamed the Royal Naval College in 1806 – was founded, for 40 students aged between 13 and 16, who would take three years to complete a course of study defined in an illustrated book, and would earn two years of sea time as part of their studies. The rating of midshipman-by-order, or midshipman ordinary, was used specifically for graduates of the Royal Naval College, to distinguish them from midshipmen who had served aboard ship, who were paid more. The school was unpopular in the Navy, because officers enjoyed the privilege of having servants and preferred the traditional method of training officers via apprenticeship.

In 1794, officers&#x27; servants were abolished and a new class of volunteers called &#x27;volunteer class I&#x27; was created for boys between the ages of 11 and 13 who were considered future midshipmen and lived in the gunroom on a ship-of-the-line or with the midshipmen on a frigate or smaller vessel. Volunteers were paid £6 per year. By 1816, the rating of midshipman ordinary was phased out, and all apprentice officers were rated as midshipmen.

=====Social background and uniform=====

In the 18th century Royal Navy, rank and position on board ship was defined by a mix of two hierarchies, an official hierarchy of ranks and a conventionally recognized social divide between gentlemen and non-gentlemen. Boys aspiring for a commission were often called young gentlemen instead of their substantive rating to distinguish their higher social standing from the ordinary sailors. Generally, aboard most warships common seamen berthed in the gundeck, while officers were quartered at the stern. Occasionally, a midshipman would be posted aboard a ship in a lower rating such as able seaman but would eat and sleep with his social equals in the cockpit.

Approximately 50 percent of midshipmen were the sons of professional men, which included the sons of naval officers, and there were notable sailing families throughout the Age of Sail, such as the Saumarez, Hood, and Parker families. The niceties of preferment and promotion made family connections an obvious advantage for prospective officers. Members of the peerage and landed gentry formed the next largest group, about 27 percent of officers. The numbers were smaller, but similarly, their connections gave them excellent prospects for promotion, and they had a considerable influence on the Royal Navy. A notable member of this group was Prince William, later William IV, who served as a midshipman from 1780 to 1785. The rest were from commercial or working class backgrounds, and because of the advantages possessed by the nobility and professional sailors, their chances of promotion to lieutenant were slim.

Since most midshipmen were from the gentry or had family connections with sailing ships, many used their connections to have their names placed on a ship&#x27;s books. The practice, known colloquially as &quot;false muster&quot; was common even though it was technically illegal and frowned upon. This allowed some boys to be promoted to midshipmen, or in some cases lieutenant, without having completed the required amount of time at sea. A notable example was Thomas Cochrane, whose uncle had him entered at the age of five; his name was carried on various ships until he was 18 and received his commission.

When uniforms were introduced in the Navy in 1748, midshipmen started wearing the same uniform as commissioned officers. They also began wearing their traditional badge of rank, a white patch of cloth with a gold button and a twist of white cord on each side of the coat collar. The uniform emphasized that midshipmen were gentlemen and officers under instruction.

=====Duties and promotion=====

Midshipmen were expected to work on the ship, but were also expected to learn navigation and seamanship. They were expected to have learned already, as able seamen and volunteers, to rig sails, other duties included keeping watch, relaying messages between decks, supervising gun batteries, commanding small boats, and taking command of a sub-division of the ship&#x27;s company under the supervision of one of the lieutenants. On smaller ships, midshipmen were instructed by a senior master&#x27;s mate, often a passed midshipman, who taught them mathematics, navigation, and sailing lore. Larger ships would carry a schoolmaster, who was rated as a midshipman but usually was a civilian like the chaplain. Midshipmen were expected to keep detailed navigational logs, which were shown to the captain to assess their progress.
Prior to promotion to lieutenant, a commissioned officer candidate in the Royal Navy had to pass a formal examination. Officially, a prospective lieutenant was at least 19, and was expected to produce proof of his service, which would include certificates from his commanders and journals kept while a midshipman. However, most midshipmen aspired to take the lieutenant examination at age 17 or 18, and the typical age of a midshipman was between 15 and 22. The candidate was summoned before a board of three captains and questioned about seamanship, navigation, and discipline. The board would ask questions such as: 
An enemy is observed; give orders for clearing your ship, and make all the necessary preparations for engaging.

Like the board, which might be an &quot;ad hoc&quot; affair, the actual exam questions were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains. In seamanship, the candidate was expected to be able to splice ropes, reef a sail, work a ship in sailing and shift his tides. In navigation, he was expected to be able to keep a reckoning of the ship&#x27;s way by plane sailing, to use Mercator projection maps and observation of the sun and stars to determine the course and position of the ship, and to understand the variation of the compass. He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an able seaman and midshipman.

Failure usually meant six more months of sea service before the examination could again be attempted. Some men never passed it. Successful completion made the midshipman a &#x27;passed midshipman&#x27;. From the 18th century until the second half of the 19th century, a midshipman in the Royal Navy who passed the lieutenant&#x27;s examination did not automatically receive a commission. Midshipmen with political connections were promoted first, while others would wait their turn on a roster. During wartime, when large numbers of ships and men might be lost in battle, most passed midshipman would be promoted in a year or two, but during peacetime the wait might be so long that the midshipman would eventually be considered too old and lose his chance for a commission.

Passed midshipmen awaiting promotion often elected to become master&#x27;s mates, a high-ranking petty officer who assisted the master with his duties, served on watch as deputy to the lieutenants, and commanded small boats. A midshipman who became master&#x27;s mate earned an increase in pay from £2 5s to £3 16s per month but initially reduced his chances at a commission because master&#x27;s mates, along with masters, were assumed to have a working-class background. Over time, however, appointment to master&#x27;s mate became considered a normal part of the path to a commission; the situation caused some confusion during the last part of the 18th century, when two parallel roles – master&#x27;s mates trying to become masters, and former midshipmen working toward a commission – held the same title and responsibilities aboard ship.

By the first years of the 19th century, the term &#x27;mate&#x27;, without the prefix master&#x27;s, was used for passed midshipmen, to distinguish them from master&#x27;s mates who had not served as midshipmen. In 1824, the rating of master&#x27;s assistant replaced master&#x27;s mate, and mate continued to be used unofficially by passed midshipmen. These changes helped eliminate the confusion caused by the mingling of midshipmen in the navigator&#x27;s branch. In 1838 a Royal Commission, presided over by the Duke of Wellington, recommended the institution of the rank of mate as an official step between midshipman and lieutenant. In 1861 mate was abolished in favor of sub-lieutenant.

====United States Navy (1794–1845)====
When Congress created the United States Navy in 1794, midshipman was listed as a rank of warrant officer in the Naval Act of 1794, and they were appointed by the President of the United States. Midshipmen had similar duties and responsibilities as in the Royal Navy, and were typically young men between the age of 14 and 22 in training to become a naval officer. &quot;Passed midshipman&quot; was first used in 1819, and was an official rank of the US Navy.

During the long period of peace between 1815 and 1846 midshipmen had few opportunities for promotion, and their warrants were often obtained via patronage. The poor quality of officer training in the US Navy became visible after the Somers Affair, an alleged mutiny aboard the training ship USS &quot;Somers&quot; in 1842, and the subsequent execution of midshipman Philip Spencer. Spencer had gained his post aboard the &quot;Somers&quot; via the influence of his father, United States Secretary of War John C. Spencer.

Cadet officer commonly used in maritime service. It&#x27;s know as a Trainee officer on board a ship. 

====Royal Navy from 1836====

The original Royal Naval College closed in 1837, after which the only method for training midshipmen in the Royal Navy was aboard ships. In 1844 the rank of naval cadet was created, and to qualify as a midshipman a candidate had to be 14 years old, successfully pass an admiralty examination and have two years of service as a naval cadet or three years of service in the Navy. A decline in qualified officers prompted the Navy to order training in a ship at anchor for all cadets, which began in 1857 aboard HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot;, which was replaced by HMS &quot;Britannia&quot; in 1859. &quot;Britannia&quot; was moved to Portland in 1862, and to the present location of the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth in 1863.

Beginning in the 1840s the normal entry age for executive officer cadets, those destined to command ships and fleets, was between 12 and 13, and instruction consisted of two years of classroom training, during which time trainees were rated as naval cadets. Cadets who received a first-class passing grade in studies, seamanship and conduct on their final examination could receive a credit for up to a year of sea time, and could be rated as midshipmen immediately after passing out of the college. After passing out of the college, cadets served aboard a special training vessel for one year. Cadets were then rated as midshipmen, and served aboard the fleet another two years. Midshipmen lived in the gunroom, kept watches, and ran the ship&#x27;s boats. They received instruction in navigation every day. After five total years of training and having reached the age of 19, the midshipmen were eligible to take the examination for lieutenant. After passing the examination for lieutenant, midshipmen were commissioned as sub-lieutenants, and were transferred to the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, which opened in 1873 as the &#x27;University of the Navy&#x27;.
Beginning in 1903, officer training of military and engineering students was reformed by the Selborne-Fisher scheme, and engineering and executive officer candidates began to enter the Navy in the same way, which was termed &#x27;Common Entry&#x27;. Previously engineer cadets had been trained separately at the Royal Naval Engineering College, Keyham, which was closed in 1910. In 1903 a new preparatory college was opened at the Royal Naval College, Osborne, in part of Queen Victoria&#x27;s favorite residence but not a favorite of her successor Edward VII who had presented it to the nation in 1902. Training initially consisted of two years at Osborne and two years at Dartmouth as cadets, later four years at Dartmouth, followed by approximately 3 years of sea duty as midshipmen prior to promotion to sub-lieutenant. In 1905 a new building was completed on shore to replace &quot;Britannia&quot;, which was named Britannia Royal Naval College. In 1913, increasing demand for officers led to recruitment of 18-year-old graduates of public schools, which was called &#x27;Special Entry&#x27;, and was conducted separately from Selborne scheme cadets. Special entry cadets trained for approximately 6 months prior to service in the fleet as midshipmen. When World War I began in 1914, all the cadets at Dartmouth were quickly mobilized as midshipmen in the Reserve Fleet. During the war, two midshipmen, George Drewry and Wilfred Malleson were awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award of the British Commonwealth for gallantry, during the Landing at Cape Helles. After World War I ended, opposition to the Selborne-Fisher scheme led to re-segregating executive and engineering officers into separate branches, while common entry and special entry were maintained.

After World War II another series of reforms, influenced by the quality of officers produced by the special entry scheme and other nations&#x27; experience with training officer candidates in a university setting, were initiated to increase the quality of officers in the Navy. In 1949 the entry age was increased to 16, and by 1955 the entry age was increased to 18 and entry required a minimum of two A levels. After 1957 midshipmen no longer served in the fleet. In 1972, all cadets became midshipmen when the rank of cadet was abolished.

====United States Navy from 1845====
Congress formally authorized the establishment of the United States Military Academy in 1802, but it took almost 50 years to approve a similar school for naval officers. One major reason for the delay was that Navy leaders preferred the apprenticeship system, citing famous officers such as Nelson and the captains of the War of 1812 who did not attend a formal naval school. However, after the Somers Affair, officers realized that the system for training officers had to change to be more efficient.
George Bancroft, appointed Secretary of the Navy in 1845, decided to work outside of congressional approval and create a new academy for officers. He formed a council led by Commodore Perry to create a new system for training officers, and turned the old Fort Severn at Annapolis into a new institution which would be designated as the United States Naval Academy in 1851. Midshipmen studied at the academy for four years and trained aboard ships each summer. Midshipman began to mean &quot;passed midshipman&quot; at this time, and a student at the Naval Academy was a cadet midshipman. The rank of ensign was created in 1862, and passed midshipmen were promoted to ensign when vacancies occurred.

In 1865, the Department of Steam Enginery was created and cadet engineers were admitted to the academy for the first time. In 1874, Congress changed the curriculum to include four years of classroom training and two years of sea duty aboard a regular vessel prior to examinations as warranted midshipmen. In 1882, Congress eliminated the distinction in training between engineer and naval cadets, and designated the student officers as naval cadets; the name reverted to midshipmen in 1902. By an act of Congress passed in 1903, two appointments as midshipmen were allowed for each senator, representative, and delegate in Congress, two for the District of Columbia, and five each year at large. In 1912, Congress authorized commissioning midshipmen as ensigns on graduation day, and ended the previously required two years of post-graduation sea service as warrant officers.

In 1930, the Naval Academy received accreditation as an approved technological institution. In 1933, a new law enabled the Naval, Military, and Coast Guard Academies to award bachelor of science degrees, and the class of 1933 was the first to receive this degree and have it written in the diploma. In 1937, the superintendent of the Naval Academy was granted the authority to award Bachelor of Science degrees to all living graduates.

====Commonwealth navies====
As Dominions of the British Empire formed their own navies during the 20th century, further countries began using the rank of midshipman. Today Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, India, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Kenya, and Brunei use the rank. Prior to 1968 Canada also used the rank of midshipman, until the National Defence Act consolidated the Royal Canadian Navy with the Army and Air Force into a single military, called the Canadian Forces. As part of the act, the rank of midshipman was replaced with the rank of naval cadet.

===Snotty===
In Royal Navy slang, a midshipman is sometimes referred to as a &quot;snotty&quot;. Two popular stories give origins for the term: the first claims that it arose from a shortage of handkerchiefs among midshipmen, who would consequently use their sleeves to wipe their noses. Prince William, later William IV, is sometimes cited as a notorious example of this practice among midshipmen. The other story claims that the three buttons formerly sewn onto midshipmen&#x27;s jacket cuffs were placed there to prevent them from wiping their noses on their sleeves.

==Modern usage==
===Royal Navy===

In the modern Royal Navy, a midshipman is the lowest rank of officer, and ranks with second lieutenant in the British Army and pilot officer in the Royal Air Force and above all enlisted and warrant ranks. A midshipman&#x27;s rank insignia, which has changed little since Napoleonic times, is called a &quot;turnback&quot;: a white patch of cloth with a gold button and a twist of white cord on each side of the coat collar.

Prospective officers must have at least five GCSEs, including English and maths, plus at least 72 (new tariff) UCAS points from at least two A levels or other suitable qualifications (each qualification must be over 45 (old tariff) UCAS points). They must pass a two-and-a-half-day assessment, called the Admiralty Interview Board, and a medical examination.

Initial officer training for the Royal Navy takes place at Britannia Royal Naval College. The first two phases are 15 weeks each, followed by specialisation training. All prospective officers join as midshipman, but use the rank of officer cadet when under initial training.

During the first seven weeks of training, officer cadets learn militarisation and sea sense, focusing on learning about the military environment, along with team and leadership skills. During the second seven weeks, officer cadets learn essential sea officer skills, including navigation and the marine environment, strategic studies, and basic sea survival. During the second term officer cadets spend 6 weeks in Initial Sea Time (IST), serving aboard capital warships as junior ratings. Upon completion of Initial Sea Time, officer cadets return to Dartmouth for four weeks to complete their final leadership assessment, the Maritime Leadership Exercise (MARL). MARL may be completed prior to IST depending on scheduling. If they have been successful, officers of all branches then pass out of the college.

Upon completion of initial officer training, university cadet entrants, engineering, logistics and flight specialisation officer cadets move to their second phase of training elsewhere within the Royal Navy. Midshipmen specializing in warfare remain at the college for the Initial Warfare Officer&#x27;s Foundation course, which completes part of a foundation degree in naval studies (equating to two thirds of a bachelor&#x27;s degree), on completion of initial professional training. Officers can complete degrees via distance learning with the Open University, although completion is not required.

====Royal Australian Navy====
A midshipman in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) holds a commission, which is effective from the date of their appointment. Officer candidates enter the RAN at various ranks depending on previous experience or degree qualifications; graduates from a three-year course, non-degree qualified entrants, and sailor changeovers below the rank of leading seaman enter as midshipman.

On joining the RAN, midshipmen complete six months&#x27; initial officer training (New Entry Officers&#x27; Course) at the Royal Australian Naval College. Following this, all members serve six months in the fleet completing Primary Qualification (PQ) continuation training. Direct entry midshipmen continue their normal training and Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) entry midshipmen post to Canberra to study at the ADFA in their second year in the Navy. Midshipmen undertake an undergraduate degree over the course of three years, whilst also completing elements of their naval training. ADFA midshipmen are also undergraduate students of the University of New South Wales (UNSW). When they graduate from UNSW at ADFA at the completion of their three- or four-year undergraduate program, they do so with a fully recognized degree from UNSW – the same degree received by graduates of UNSW&#x27;s campus in Sydney. During Single Service Training (SST) at ADFA, midshipmen have the opportunity to return to sea during the SST period as well as visiting shore establishments for PQ related training.

====Royal New Zealand Navy====
In the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN), midshipman is the lowest officer rank for officers under training and retained upon completion of initial training by those without a university degree. Unlike officer cadet ranks in the Army, midshipmen are treated as officers but do not hold a commission. The RNZN has approximately 60 midshipmen in service at a time.

Midshipman begin their career at Junior Officer Common Training, which lasts 21 weeks. After completing their initial training course, midshipmen serve aboard ships for a short time, followed by specialty training for 16 weeks. After approximately two years in the Navy, midshipmen are promoted to ensign. Officers who entered the service with a university degree are promoted to sub-lieutenant after completion of Junior Officer Common Training. Officers without a degree have the option of earning a university degree while serving in the Navy.

====South African Navy====
A midshipman in the South African Navy (SAN) is an officer of the lowest rank. Officer candidates are citizens between the ages of 18 and 22, either in grade 12 or graduated from high school with an academic background in mathematics and science. Cadets initially spend a year training at the South African Naval College in Gordon&#x27;s Bay, about 55 km southeast of Cape Town, and upon graduation are commissioned as midshipmen. Midshipmen can then study for three more years at the South African Military Academy, and upon graduation receive a B Mil degree from Stellenbosch University.

====Indian Navy====
Midshipmen in the Indian Navy begin their career as cadets at the National Defence Academy or the Indian Naval Academy, where they study for approximately three years. After graduation they receive a BTech degree from Jawaharlal Nehru University and are assigned to training ships for one year. After six months aboard the training ship, the cadets are promoted to midshipman. At the end of their training midshipmen are examined by a board and are cleared for promotion to sub-lieutenant.

====Pakistan Navy====
Cadets in the Pakistan Navy undertake an initial 18 months&#x27; training at the Pakistan Naval Academy. They study humanities, engineering, professional and technical subjects. After passing out they are appointed midshipmen, and undertake another six months of training at sea. They are assigned to operations, weapons engineering, mechanical engineering, or logistics. After passing the final fleet examination, they are promoted to the rank of sub-lieutenant.

===United States Naval and Merchant Marine Academies===

In the modern United States Navy, a midshipman is classified as an officer of the line, though their exercise of authority is limited by their training status. Legally, midshipmen are a special grade of uncommissioned officer that ranks between the senior noncommissioned enlisted grade (E-9) and the lowest grade of chief warrant officer (W-2, in the U.S. Coast Guard, which does not currently use the grade of warrant officer (W-1)) or warrant officer (W-1), U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, or U.S. Marine Corps.

Students at the United States Naval Academy (USNA) are appointed to Office as midshipmen, United States Navy, by the President, alone, without Senate confirmation. Students at the United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) are appointed to Office as midshipmen, United States Navy Reserve, by the Secretary of the Navy, using delegated Presidential authority, and are likewise not subject to Senate confirmation. Students in the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) are also appointed to Office as midshipmen, United States Navy Reserve, by the Secretary of the Navy, without Senate confirmation. The student body at the USNA is the Brigade of Midshipmen, and the student body at the USMMA is the Regiment of Midshipmen.

Generally, a nomination from a member of Congress or the Vice President is required to receive an appointment to the USNA. A nomination does not guarantee an appointment; in a typical year about 38% of nominees receive an appointment. Currently each member of Congress and the Vice President can have five appointees attending the Naval Academy at any time. Other nomination sources include the Secretary of the Navy, who may appoint 170 enlisted members of the regular and reserve Navy and Marine Corps to the Naval Academy each year, and the President may nominate an unlimited number of children of career military personnel for up to 100 appointments each year. Additionally, children of Medal of Honor recipients and select cadets of JROTC Honor Unit with Distinction units do not need a nomination but need only qualify for admission. The United States Merchant Marine Academy only accepts nominations from members of Congress. There are currently no Presidential, Vice-Presidential, military-affiliated, JROTC-honor unit, ROTC or Unit Commander, or Medal of Honor nominations permitted to the USMMA.

Midshipmen at the US Naval Academy, US Merchant Marine Academy, and in the NROTC wear uniforms that comply with standards established for commissioned officers of the Navy, with shoulder board and sleeve insignia varying by school year or midshipman officer rank as prescribed by Chapter 6 of Navy Uniform Regulations. Midshipmen wear gold fouled anchors as the primary insignia on caps and shoulder boards and gold plain anchors as collar insignia on service dress and full dress uniforms. Marine-option midshipmen in the NROTC wear gold Eagle, Globe and Anchor insignia in place of the fouled anchor insignia worn by all other midshipmen.

Midshipmen at the US Naval Academy study a core curriculum of engineering, natural sciences, the humanities, and social sciences, and participate in a required &quot;summer cruise&quot; with an active vessel after their freshman (plebe) ad junior academic years. Upon graduation, midshipmen are commissioned as ensigns in the Navy or second lieutenants in the Marine Corps.

Midshipmen at the United States Merchant Marine Academy study a similar core curriculum, except they are split into deck (navigation oriented) and engineering programs. Additionally, they typically spend a year at sea working as cadets on U.S. flagged merchant ships, visiting ports around the world. At graduation they have two options: (1) a job in the maritime industry ashore or sailing aboard commercial US-flagged vessels, plus a US Navy Reserve commission, or (2) an active-duty commission in any of the United States Uniformed Services (Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, or United States Public Health Service) as an ensign or second lieutenant.
==Other countries==
Today, ranks equivalent to midshipman exist in many countries. Using U.S. midshipman or pre-fleet board UK midshipman as the basis for comparison, the equivalent rank would be a naval cadet in training to become a junior commissioned officer. Using post-fleet board UK midshipman for comparison, the rank would be the most junior commissioned officer in the rank structure, and similar to a U.S. ensign in role and responsibility.

The Royal Netherlands Navy has included a midshipman rank since the 17th century. The Dutch term &quot;adelborst&quot; translates to &quot;noble youth&quot; and stems from the time that naval officers were recruited from the nobility. Today, &quot;adelborsten&quot; train at the Royal Netherlands Naval College () for 3 years. 

Officer cadets in the German Navy begin their training at the Naval Academy Mürwik () in Flensburg-Mürwik holding enlisted ranks with the qualifier officer candidate (), abbreviated as OA. After about a year, they are promoted to &quot;Seekadetten&quot;, equivalent to the non-commissioned officer (NCO) rank Mate (), and move to the University of the German Federal Armed Forces. About nine months later, they are promoted to &quot;Fähnrich zur See&quot; rank, equivalent to the NCO rank Boatswain (). After 30 months of total training they are promoted to the final officer candidate rank, &quot;Oberfähnrich zur See&quot;, equivalent to the NCO rank &quot;Hauptbootsmann&quot;, and after about 4 years of total training graduate with a master&#x27;s degree.

The Spanish Navy uses the rank of Guardiamarina in 1717, established with the formation at Cadiz of the Royal Company of Midshipmen (). Titles derived from the Spanish name are used in latin american navies. This originated in the succession of the Bourbon Philip V of Spain to the Spanish throne, when the French system of naval officer education spread to Spain. The French rank of &quot;garde de la marine&quot; was established in 1670, when an office of the monarchy selected young gentlemen from the nobility to serve the King in the Gardes de la Marine. The concept of the &quot;Gardes&quot; was borrowed from the various guards units within the Maison militaire du roi de France. In 1686 these guards were organized into companies of cadets at the ports of Brest, Rochefort and Toulon. Unlike midshipmen in the Royal Navy, the &quot;Gardes&quot; trained mostly on shore and focused on military drill and theory rather than practical skills in gunnery, navigation and seamanship. By restricting the French officer corps to members of the nobility, there were not enough &quot;Gardes&quot; to man all of the ships during wartime. To fill the gaps, volunteers were temporarily recruited from the merchant service; they were allowed to hold permanent rank in the navy starting in 1763. These professional officers wore blue uniforms to distinguish them from the &quot;Gardes de la Marine&quot; who wore red uniforms. After the revolution, the royal connotations of the term &quot;garde marine&quot; led to its replacement with &quot;aspirant&quot; (officer cadet), and later &quot;élèves de la Marine&quot; (naval officer candidate). 

The French Navy has adopted new names for officer cadets at the École navale begin their first year as &quot;élève-officier&quot;, are promoted in their second year to &quot;aspirant&quot;, and in their third year are commissioned as an acting sub-lieutenant (). 
In many romance languages, the literal translation of the local term for &quot;midshipman&quot; into English is &quot;Navy Guard&quot;, including the French &quot;garde-marine&quot;, Spanish &quot;guardia marina&quot;, Portuguese &quot;guarda-marinha&quot;, and Italian &quot;guardiamarina&quot;, and in most cases the term refers to the lowest ranking commissioned naval officer. While in modern French-English dictionaries, &quot;élève officier&quot; translates to midshipman, both the historical term &quot;garde-marine&quot; and the modern term for an officer candidate, &quot;aspirant&quot;, are other equivalents to midshipman.

<text>In a military navy, a rate or rating (sometimes bluejacket in the United States), is a junior enlisted sailor who is below the military rank of warrant officer. They are not commissioned officers. Depending on the country and navy that uses it, the exact term and the range of ranks that it refers to may vary.

==Royal Navy==
In the Royal Navy (RN) and other navies in the Commonwealth, &quot;rate&quot; and &quot;rating&quot; are interchangeably used to refer to an enlisted sailor who is ranked below warrant officers and commissioned officers, but may include petty officers and chief petty officers. Specifically, &quot;rate&quot; is the term used to describe generically all members of all ranks below a warrant officer; whereas &quot;rating&quot; is part of the official name of individual specific ranks, such as Able Rating and Leading Rating.

The term comes from the general nautical usage of &#x27;rating&#x27;, to refer to a seaman&#x27;s class or grade as recorded in the ship&#x27;s books. The system of conferring authority on sailors in the Royal Navy evolved through the recognition of competence: landsman, ordinary seaman, able seaman, through to the appointment of authority as a petty officer.

The general structure for ratings in the Royal Navy now used breaks down into four major groupings:
*Able Rating (OR-2)
*Leading Rating (OR-4)
*Petty Officer (OR-5/OR-6)
*Chief Petty Officer (OR-7)

==United States Navy and United States Coast Guard==
In the United States Navy (USN), the term &quot;bluejacket&quot; is used instead to refer to enlisted sailors that rank below a chief petty officer. &#x27;Bluejacket&#x27; derives itself from an item of clothing that was worn by junior enlisted sailors before 1886. It was used especially when the sailors were deployed ashore as infantry.

In the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard, the term &quot;rate&quot; refers to an enlisted member&#x27;s pay grade (i.e. relative seniority or rank), while &quot;rating&quot; refers to occupational field. In the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, an enlisted sailor is most commonly addressed, both verbally and in correspondence, by a combination of their rate and rating rather than by rate alone, unlike in other branches of the armed forces. For example, a sailor whose rate is &#x27;Petty Officer 1st Class&#x27; (pay grade E-6) and whose rating is &#x27;boatswain&#x27;s mate&#x27; would be addressed as &#x27;Boatswain&#x27;s Mate 1st Class&#x27; (abbreviated BM1). However, it is also correct to address sailors in pay grades E-4 through E-6 simply as &#x27;petty officer&#x27; (e.g. &#x27;Petty Officer Jane Smith&#x27;) and pay grades E-7, E-8, and E-9 are addressed as &#x27;Chief&#x27;, &#x27;Senior Chief&#x27;, or &#x27;Master Chief&#x27; respectively. Pay grades E-3 and below maybe referred to as their rate and rating, a Gunner&#x27;s Mate Seaman Apprentice would be &#x27;GMSA&#x27;. Those who do not have a rating, are sometimes referred to as &#x27;non-rates&#x27;, and simply addressed as &#x27;Seaman&#x27;, or by their last name alone; i.e. &#x27;Seaman Jones&#x27; or merely &#x27;Jones&#x27;.

<text>Edgar Quinet (; 17 February 180327 March 1875) was a French historian and intellectual.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Quinet was born at Bourg-en-Bresse, in the &quot;département&quot; of Ain. His father, Jérôme Quinet, had been a commissary in the army, but being a strong republican and disgusted with Napoleon&#x27;s 18 Brumaire coup, he gave up his post and devoted himself to scientific and mathematical study. Edgar, who was an only child, was usually alone, but his mother (Eugénie Rozat Lagis, who was an educated person with strong, albeit original, Protestant religious views) exercised great influence over him.

He was sent to school, first in Bourg and then in Lyon. His father wished him on leaving school to go into the army, and then enter a business career. Quinet was determined to engage in literature, and after a time got his way when he moved to Paris in 1820.

His first publication, &quot;Les tablettes du juif errant&quot; (&quot;The Tablets of the Wandering Jew&quot;), which appeared in 1823, symbolized the progress of humanity. He became impressed with German intellectual writing and undertook the translation of Johann Gottfried Herder&#x27;s &quot;Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit&quot; (&quot;Outlines of Philosophy of the History of Man&quot;). He learnt German for the purpose, published his work in 1827, and obtained through it considerable credit.

===Early writings===
At this time he was introduced to Victor Cousin, and made the acquaintance of Jules Michelet. He had visited Germany and the United Kingdom before the appearance of his book. Cousin obtained for him a position on a government mission in Greece, the &quot;Scientific Expedition of Morea&quot;, in 1829 (at the end of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire), and on his return he published in 1830 a book on &quot;La Grèce moderne&quot; (&quot;Modern Greece&quot;). With Michelet he published a volume of works in 1843, denouncing Jesuits and blaming them for religious, political and social troubles. He also became acquainted with and a lover of the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1838. Quinet wrote several lectures praising Emerson&#x27;s works which were published with the title of &quot;Le Christianisme et la Revolution Francaise&quot; in 1845.

Hopes of employment that he had after the July Revolution were frustrated by his reputation as a speculative republican. Nonetheless, he joined the staff of the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;, and for some years contributed numerous essays, the most remarkable of which was that on &quot;Les Épopées françaises du XIIème siècle&quot;, an early, although not the earliest, appreciation of the long-neglected &quot;chansons de geste&quot;. &quot;Ahasverus&quot;, his first major original work, appeared in 1833it is a singular prose poem.

Shortly afterwards he married Minna More, a German girl with whom he had fallen in love some years before. Growing disillusioned with German thought because of Prussian aggressive tactics, he visited Italy, and, besides writing many essays, produced two poems, &quot;Napoléon&quot; (1835) and &quot;Prométhée&quot; (1838), both written in verse and seen as inferior to &quot;Ahasverus&quot; published in 1833. In 1838 he published a strong reply to David Strauss&#x27; &quot;Leben Jesu&quot;, and in that year he received the Legion of Honour. In 1839 he was appointed professor of foreign literature at Lyon, where he began the highly influential course of lectures which formed the basis for his &quot;Génie des religions&quot;. Two years later he was transferred to the Collège de France, and the &quot;Génie des religions&quot;, published (1842), he sympathized with all religions but did not favor one above all.

===Professorship===
Quinet&#x27;s Parisian professorship, which began in 1842, was notorious as the subject of polemics. His chair was that of Southern Literature, but, neglecting his proper subject, he chose, in conjunction with Michelet, to engage in a violent polemic with the Jesuits and with Ultramontanism. Two books bearing exactly these titles appeared in 1843 and 1844, and contained, as was usual with Quinet, the substance of his lectures.

These lectures excited great debate and the author obstinately refused to return to literature strictly construed; consequently, in 1846, the government put an end to the lectures, a measure that was arguably approved by the majority of his colleagues. He was dismissed in 1846 by the Collège de France for his adamant attacks on the Roman Catholic Church, exaltation of the revolution, support for the oppressed nationalities of France and for supporting the theory that religion is a determining force in societies.

===1848 Revolution===
By this time Quinet was a pronounced republican, and something of a revolutionary. He joined the rioters during the 1848 Revolution which overthrew King Louis-Philippe of France, and was elected by the &quot;département&quot; of Ain to the Constituent and then to the Legislative Assembly, where he affiliated with the extreme radical party.

He had published in 1848 &quot;Les Révolutions d&#x27;Italie&quot; (&quot;The Revolutions of Italy&quot;), one of his main works. He wrote numerous pamphlets during the short-lived Second French Republic, attacked the Roman expedition with all his strength and was from the first an uncompromising opponent of Prince Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (Napoleon III).

===Exile===
Quinet fled Louis Napoléon&#x27;s 1851 coup d&#x27;état to Brussels until 1858 and then fled to Veytaux, Switzerland, until 1870. His wife had died some time previously, and he now married Hermiona Asachi (or &quot;Asaky&quot;), the daughter of Gheorghe Asachi, a Romanian poet. In Brussels, Quinet lived for some seven years, during which he published &quot;Les Esclaves&quot; (&quot;The Slaves&quot;, 1853), a dramatic poem, &quot;Marnix de Sainte-Aldégonde&quot; (1854), a study of the Reformer in which he emphasizes Sainte-Aldégonde&#x27;s literary merit, and some other books.

In Veytaux, his literary output was greater than ever. In 1860, he published a unique volume, partly reflecting the style of &quot;Ahasverus&quot;, and entitled &quot;Merlin l&#x27;enchanteur&quot; (&quot;Merlin the Enchanter&quot;); in 1862, a &quot;Histoire de la campagne de 1815&quot; (&quot;History of the Campaign of 1815&quot;), in 1865 an elaborate book on the French Revolution, in which the author depicts atrocities carried out by revolutionary forces (causing his rejection by many other partisans of republican ideas). Many pamphlets date from this period, as does &quot;La Création&quot; (1870), a third book of the genre of &quot;Ahasverus&quot; and &quot;Merlin&quot;, but even vaguer – dealing with physical science rather than history, legend, or philosophy for the most part.

===Return and final years===
Quinet had refused to return to France to join the liberal opposition against Napoleon III, but returned immediately after the Battle of Sedan in the Franco-Prussian War. He was then restored to his professorship, and during the siege of Paris wrote vehemently against the Germans. He was elected deputy to the National Assembly by the &quot;département&quot; of the Seine in 1871, and was one of the most obstinate opponents of the terms of peace between France and Germany. He continued to write till his death, which occurred at Versailles in 1875.

&quot;Le Siège de Paris et la défense nationale&quot; (&quot;The Siege of Paris and the National Defence&quot;) appeared in 1871, &quot;La République&quot; (&quot;The Republic&quot;) in 1872, &quot;Le Livre de l&#x27;exilé&quot; (&quot;The Book of Exile&quot;) in the year of its author&#x27;s death and after it. This was followed by three volumes of letters and some other work. Quinet had already in 1858 published a semi-autobiographical book called &quot;Histoire de mes idées&quot; (&quot;History of My Ideas&quot;).

==Personality==
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition:
==Early editions==
His numerous works appeared in a uniform edition of twenty-eight volumes (1877–79). His second wife, in 1870, published certain &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;exil&quot;, and &quot;Lettres d&#x27;exil&quot; followed in 1885. In that year Prof. George Saintsbury published a selection of the &quot;Lettres à ma mère&quot; (&quot;Letters to My Mother&quot;) with an introduction.

<text>The emperor goose (Anser canagicus), also known as the beach goose or the painted goose, is a waterfowl species in the family Anatidae, which contains the ducks, geese, and swans. In summer, the emperor goose is found in remote coastal areas near the Bering Sea in arctic and sub-arctic Alaska and the Russian Far East, where it breeds in monogamous pairs. It migrates south to winter in ice-free mudflats and coasts in Alaska, mostly the Aleutian Islands, and Canada&#x27;s British Columbia, rarely reaching the contiguous United States. Listed as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the species&#x27; population is declining due to threats such as pollution, hunting, and climate change.

== Taxonomy ==
The emperor goose was described in 1802 as &quot;Anas canagica&quot;. Its type locality is Kanaga Island, which is located in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska. The species has sometimes been classified in the genus &quot;Chen&quot; and less commonly in its own genus, &quot;Philacte&quot;.

== Description ==

The emperor goose has a stout blue-gray body, with spots of black and white, which cause it to have a &quot;scaled appearance&quot;. Its head and the back of its neck are white and tinged with amber-yellow; unlike the snow goose, the white does not extend to the front of the neck.

The goose is also characterized by a black chin and throat, a white tail, a pink bill, which is tipped with white, and yellow-orange legs and feet. The underside of the emperor goose&#x27;s wings is gray, unlike the snow goose, which has black and white on the underside of its wings. The head of adults frequently turns to a reddish-brown color in summer, due to its feeding in tidal pools with iron oxide.

Goslings (i.e. young shortly after hatching) are grayish-white colored; unlike adults, their bill is black. Goslings are also distinguished from adults by having gray, brown, or black feet and an area of white surrounding the bill for the first three weeks after hatching.

Juveniles (i.e. immature specimens older than goslings) are mostly gray colored, with a small amount of white on their feathers. Younger juveniles have a dark head and neck, with their head being dusty-colored with patches of white. However, after October, their head and upper neck turn to mostly white, although they still have scattered darker feathers. By the first winter, juveniles have the same coloring and features as adults.

=== Measurements and weight ===
Adult males grow to a total length of and females .

Other measurements in males, sampled from four specimens in Alaska and California, include a tarsus (lower leg), a bill, and a folded wing. These measurements are similar in females, but females have a slightly shorter folded wing of based on two Alaskan individuals. The goose has a wingspan of . Because of its short wings, it flies slowly, requiring quick strokes.

Males weigh between and . They have a mean weight of , while females have a mean weight of . The average weight of juveniles is in males and in females. Roughly 5–7.5 weeks after hatching, the goose averages a weight of and in males and females, respectively. It has a heavy body and short neck compared to other geese. Although the species can live to age 25 in captivity, it reaches age 12 in the wild.

== Behavior ==
The emperor goose is migratory, traveling north in the summer to breed and south for the winter. Unlike many goose species, which migrate thousands of miles, the emperor goose travels a few hundred miles for migration, usually about to . Breeding birds molt near the breeding colonies, but geese unsuccessful with breeding move to either St. Lawrence Island or the Chukchi Peninsula to molt prior to the main southerly migration for winter.

=== Breeding ===
The breeding season starts in late June in Russia, but begins a few weeks earlier in Alaska, generally between 20 May and 3 June. Only individuals three years or older will mate. A monogamous species, female emperor geese have a single mate throughout their life and only mate with any other male if their mate dies. The species molts from late July to early August and leaves its breeding grounds later than any other species.

The emperor goose breeds on tundra, building its nests in areas or closer to the coast. The nests are typically constructed in marshes. They are built as holes in the ground without containing nesting material, but are later built up with vegetation, such as leaves, and feathers, which the female plucks from herself.

The species usually lays 4–6 eggs, but it can lay anywhere from 2 to 8; eggs are often laid in the nests of other emperor geese families. Eggs measure by on average, with an elliptical shape and a smooth shell. They are initially white colored, but become speckled with stains from their nest. Egg incubation, usually lasting 24 days, is performed only by females.

According to &quot;The Game Birds of California&quot;, a 1918 book, surveys of the species&#x27; nests showed that the male did not stay with the nest. However, the Beardsley Zoo says that although the male does not help build the nest, it defends it. The eggs hatch in late June and early July. Exhibiting precociality, young are able to walk and swim hours after hatching, as well as feed themselves. They typically vacate the nest the same day as their hatching, although they do not wander far from their parents until after two months. Young can fly once 50−60 days old. 10% of emperor geese remain alive after their first year.
Individuals of the species usually only interact with their family; however, larger flocks collect during the breeding season and the molting season. It is one of the most unsocial goose species; the only goose less social than it is the black brant. It stays low when flying, usually keeping below above the ground and often coming close to touching the ground with its wings.

=== Diet ===
In the summer, the species&#x27; diet consists of vegetation, such as shoots, roots, and berries, while in the winter it primarily eats bivalve molluscs (which it uses its sense of touch to catch) and algae.

Unlike other goose species, its diet mostly consists of animals, causing its flesh to have a strong flavor. When living near water, it eats at the edge of water bodies, which has given it the name &quot;Beach Goose&quot;. If the species feels threatened, it goes into a body of water and swims away until the threat is a safe distance from it.

=== Vocalizations ===
Its vocalizations, according to Edward William Nelson, sound like &quot;kla-ha, kla-ha, kla-ha&quot;, and can be differentiated from those of other geese by having a more &quot;nasal&quot; sound. It vocalizes less often than other geese, such as the white-fronted goose.

== Habitat and distribution ==
During the summer, the emperor goose lives in Arctic and subarctic climates in the Bering Sea, around Alaska and a small part of northeast Russia. Its habitats in this season include freshwater pools, inland lakes, and coastal lagoons. 90% of specimens nest on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. In the winter, after its southerly migration, it lives primarily among the Aleutian Islands, as well as on the Alaska Peninsula and the Kodiak Island. It sometimes spends winters in Canada and rarely as far south as northwestern California. Some areas in California the species has been found living in, as of 1918, include Humboldt Bay, Gridley, Davis, Rio Vista, Colusa County, Ingomar, Modesto, and Dixon. Its habitats are mudflats and rocky shores in the winter, in areas free of ice, and tundra wetlands in the summer. Its extent of occurrence is estimated to be .

== Conservation ==
As of August 2017, the emperor goose&#x27;s population is increasing slowly. In 1879, the emperor goose was found by Edward William Nelson to be abundant along the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.

In 1923, however, Arthur Cleveland Bent observed much fewer specimens, and reported that the population had decreased over the past 30 years prior to that. Bent said that &quot;large numbers are killed each year and their eggs taken by the natives, even within the limits of what is supposed to be a reservation&quot;, which was a major reason for the goose&#x27;s decrease in population. In 1964, the goose&#x27;s population was 139,000, which decreased to 42,000 in 1986.

The population subsequently increased, with its population having been 85,000 in 2002 and over 98,000 in 2015; According to the emperor goose&#x27;s entry on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which was entered on 1 October 2016, the total population of the emperor goose is decreasing.

However, it also said that the trend is not clear and it is increasing in parts of North America. Julian Fischer, a wildlife biologist, said in a news article published in August 2017, that the population has been experiencing a slow, steady increase.

He stated that the population had over doubled in size from the early 1980s, and that it may be as large as 170,000.

Although the reasons for the emperor goose&#x27;s population decline are not well known, it is believed to be threatened by oil pollution, hunting, and climate change.

Other factors contributing to the species&#x27; population decline include competing with the cackling goose for food and the preying of goslings. The emperor goose is listed as near threatened on the IUCN Red List and rated 14 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score. The 2016 State of North America&#x27;s Birds&#x27; Watch List, a list of threatened birds that have no major conservation actions taking place for them, includes the emperor goose.

Due to its low population in the 1980s, recreational and subsistence hunts closed for the goose in 1986 and 1987, respectively. However, 30 years later, hunts became legal again after the population grew significantly. In 2015, the Alaska Migratory Bird Co-Management Council suggested for hunting of the bird to be allowed if the population were to grow to a certain number. On 2 April 2017, subsistence hunting was allowed for the emperor goose, with hunters able to kill an unlimited number of geese. In fall 2017, emperor geese were allowed to be hunted for recreational purposes by locals of Alaska with a permit, with a limit of one bird per person.

In 2018, hunters who were not residing in Alaska were permitted to hunt the geese with a permit. However, the species cannot be hunted anywhere in the contiguous United States.

<text>The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9 (, USAF/DoD designation: Type 1, NATO reporting name: Fargo) was the first turbojet fighter developed by Mikoyan-Gurevich in the years immediately after World War II. It used reverse-engineered German BMW 003 engines. Categorized as a first-generation jet fighter, it suffered from persistent problems with engine flameouts when firing its guns at high altitudes due to gun gas ingestion. Multiple different armament configurations were tested, but none solved the problem. Several different engines were evaluated, but none were flown, as the prototype of the MiG-15 promised superior performance.

In total, 610 aircraft were built, including prototypes, and they entered service in 1948 with the Soviet Air Forces. At least 372 were transferred to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force in 1950 to defend Chinese cities against air raids by the Nationalist Chinese and train the Chinese pilots in jet operations. The MiG-9 was quickly replaced by the MiG-15. Three are known to survive.

==Development==

===Origins===
In February 1945, the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars ordered the Mikoyan-Gurevich (MiG) OKB to develop a single-seat jet fighter to be equipped with two German BMW 003 engines. Intended to destroy bombers, the aircraft was to be equipped with a single or gun, plus two guns. A more detailed directive was issued on 9 April setting out requirements that the aircraft should have a maximum speed of at sea level and a speed of at an altitude of . It should be able to climb to that altitude in four minutes or less and it should have a maximum range of . Three prototypes were ordered to be ready for flight tests by 15 March 1946.

The OKB chose a &quot;pod-and-boom&quot; layout for their new fighter, the I-300 (also called the &quot;izdeliye&quot; F (model or product F) by the OKB) because it offered the advantages of improved landing performance and better visibility from the cockpit when landing but it had some drawbacks, such as the unfamiliar tricycle arrangement of the landing gear, protecting the rear fuselage from the jet exhaust, and where to place the aircraft&#x27;s armament. The all-metal aircraft had unswept, mid-mounted wings with two prominent air intakes in the nose. Its two-spar wings were fitted with slotted flaps and Frise ailerons. Its powerplant comprised two RD-20 turbojets, which were Soviet-manufactured versions of the BMW 003. The two engines were located behind the cockpit in the lower fuselage, with the exhaust exiting under the tail unit. A steel laminate heatshield was installed on the bottom of the rear fuselage to protect it from the exhaust gasses. There were four bag-type fuel tanks in the fuselage and three in each wing, providing a total internal fuel capacity of 1,625 liters (429 US gallons). The cockpit was not pressurized. The planned armament consisted of a 57 mm NL-57 cannon mounted in the centerline engine intake bulkhead and two 23 mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon mounted on the lower lip of the air intakes. The N-57/OKB-16-57 gun was provided with 28 rounds and the two NS-23 cannons had 80 rounds each.

Construction of the three prototypes began in late 1945 and the first prototype began manufacturer&#x27;s testing on 30 December. The ground testing revealed that the engine exhaust caused a low-pressure area under the rear fuselage which caused the fighter to tilt tail-down during engine tests. The rigidly mounted heatshield caused the underside of the rear fuselage to deform because the steel and the duralumin skin of the fuselage had different expansion ratios when heated. The rear fuselage and the heatshield were both redesigned to eliminate these problems. On 23 March the prototype was trucked to the Flight Research Institute (LII)&#x27;s airfield at Ramenskoye to begin preparations for flight testing.

According to aviation historian Bill Gunston, on 24 April 1946 representatives from Mikoyan-Gurevich and the Yakovlev OKB tossed a coin to determine which aircraft would be the first Soviet jet to fly. (MiG had brought the I-300, and Yakovlev the Yak-(3)-15.) MiG won and the I-300&#x27;s first flight lasted six minutes. These early flights revealed problems with the stability of the aircraft and vibration problems with the new articulated heatshield. It was stiffened before the twelfth flight, but that only partially cured the problem. The first aircraft crashed, killing the pilot. During a demonstration in front of high-ranking officials on July 11, the attachment lugs of the wing leading edge fairings failed and they hit the horizontal stabilizers. The remaining two prototypes began flight testing the following month, but preparations for the 7 November parade commemorating the October Revolution delayed the start of the State acceptance trials until 17 December. Meanwhile, the horizontal stabilizer of the second prototype disintegrated during flight, but the pilot was able to land the aircraft safely. Another such incident happened to the third prototype in February 1947 and forced the tail to be reinforced.

The aircraft was given the service designation of MiG-9 (internal OKB designations of I-301 and &quot;izdeliye&quot; FS) and a small batch of ten aircraft, equipped with original German engines, was ordered during 1946 from Factory No. 1 in Kazan before flight testing was completed. They were intended to be used in the parade, but bad weather forced the cancellation of their flypast. Two of them were assigned to participate in the state acceptance trials while others were used as testbeds for various programs. The trials were concluded in June and the MiG-9 generally met the performance goals set by the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars. The test pilots found the fighter easy and simple to fly. Defects noted during testing were that the engines flamed out when firing the cannon at high altitudes due to gun gas ingestion, no ejection seat was fitted, nor were air brakes or a fire suppression system. The fuel tanks were not self-sealing and no armor was provided for the pilot. Despite these drawbacks, the MiG-9 was ordered into production at Factory No. 1 before the acceptance tests were completed as the Soviet leadership believed that its shortcomings could be rectified during production. A batch of 50 aircraft, 40 single-seat fighters and 10 two-seat trainers, were ordered in late 1946 to participate in the 1947 May Day parade. In recognition of their accomplishment Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich were awarded the Stalin Prize in 1947.

The two-seat trainer had the internal OKB designations of I-301T and &quot;izdeliye&quot; FT and the first prototype was converted from one of the &quot;parade&quot; aircraft during 1946. Its fuel capacity had to be reduced by one third to make room for the second tandem cockpit. Dual controls were fitted along with an intercom to allow the instructor and student to communicate in the air. Each man had an ejection seat designed after that used by the Germans in their Heinkel He 162 fighter. This aircraft was delivered on 17 January 1947, although flight testing was not completed until 5 April. The ejection seats were not tested in the air, but they required extensive testing on the ground to ensure the proper operation of the seat. State acceptance trials were not completed until 2 June and the aircraft was rejected because of the poor visibility from the rear cockpit. A second aircraft was completed on 15 July and the visibility from the rear cockpit was improved by replacing the original bulletproof windscreen with a larger glass plate, reshaping the canopy&#x27;s side panels, and removing a partition between the cockpits. This aircraft was fitted with air brakes in the wings and two drop tanks hung under its wingtips. It passed its state acceptance trials later in 1947 and was recommended for production with the service designation of UTI MiG-9. The ejection seats were extensively tested during 1948 and approved for use, but by this time the aircraft was deemed obsolete and there was no point in building a training version.

The order for 50 aircraft placed in 1946 was modified to 48 single seaters and one aircraft for the OKB itself, all lacking armament. They were manufactured in March–April 1947 with the standard armament of one 37 mm Nudelman N-37 autocannon, with 40 rounds, and two 23 mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 guns, but the production line shut down afterward to incorporate some of the desired changes. These included reinforcement and enlargement of the vertical tail to improve lateral stability; air brakes were added on the wings and the fuel system was improved. The underside of the rear fuselage was recontoured to smooth the air flow of the engine exhaust and air suction inside the fuselage was eliminated. Production restarted and a total of 243 single seaters were completed during the remainder of the year. 250 fighters and 60 trainers were scheduled to be built in 1948, but production was disrupted by preparations to begin manufacture of the vastly superior MiG-15 later that year. Only 302 fighters were delivered that year before production ceased.

The fourth and fifth aircraft of the parade batch were used in flight tests to eliminate the engine flameout problem from late 1947 through early 1948. They were fitted with a prominent rectangular hollow vane on the barrel of the N-37 cannon that was nicknamed the &quot;butterfly&quot; (bahbochka). This allowed all three cannon to be fired simultaneously at altitudes up to , but the fin disintegrated after only 813 shots, which could be very dangerous if the debris from the fin was ingested by the engines. An additional problem was that the fin hampered the directional stability of the aircraft and caused it to yaw after 3–5 shots. Another attempt to fix the problem was made in the I-302 (&quot;izdeliye&quot; FP), a modification of a production aircraft, that moved the N-37 to the port side of the aircraft, but this was apparently not successful either. Other attempts to ameliorate the problem included fitting a muzzle brake on the N-37 as well as extending its barrel, but nothing worked.

===Alternative engines===
The I-305 (&quot;izdeliye&quot; FT) was a MiG-9 airframe with a single Lyulka TR-1 turbojet of that replaced the pair of RD-20 turbojets. The armament was rearranged with the 23 mm cannon moved to each side of the fuselage, even with the N-37 gun in the centerline bulkhead; the latter&#x27;s ammunition supply was increased to 45 rounds. The aircraft was intended to have a pressurized cockpit and its overall weight was reduced to . The engine, however, was not ready for testing and the aircraft&#x27;s development was cancelled after the prototype MiG-15 began flight testing in early 1948.

In mid-1946, the Council of Ministers ordered the development of a MiG-9 with afterburning versions of the RD-20, based on the BMW 003S engine. These engines had a maximum power of and were intended to increase the aircraft&#x27;s speed to at sea level and at . The OKB was directed to build two prototypes, with a gun replacing the N-37, that would begin flight tests in April 1947. The OKB added armor plates fore and aft to protect the pilot and he was provided with a bulletproof windscreen, but no other changes were made to the aircraft. The I-307 (&quot;izdeliye&quot; FF) was ready for flight testing a month late and had to use German engines because the Soviet-built versions had not yet been tested. Manufacturer&#x27;s flight tests were completed on 21 June and the fighter began its state acceptance trials on 2 August, after its engines were replaced, but crashed on 19 August. The second prototype was converted from the fifth aircraft of the parade batch and retained the butterfly used during its earlier gun trials. It was given the same cockpit armor and windscreen as the first prototype, but it used Soviet-built RD-20F (later RD-21) engines. It began its flight trials in December and it demonstrated a top speed of at an altitude of and at , but no further development work was done. Some late-production aircraft received this engine.

Another prototype equipped with RD-21 engines and a pressurized cockpit was completed in June 1947. It was known internally as the I-307 (&quot;izdeliye&quot; FR) and was given the service designation of MiG-9M. The armament was rearranged in another attempt to ameliorate the gun gas ingestion problem with the N-37 being mounted on the starboard side of the fuselage and the two NS-23s on the port side, well aft so that the gun barrels did not protrude beyond the air intake. This caused the cockpit to be moved forward slightly which gave the pilot a better view when landing. The number of fuel tanks was reduced to five, but the aircraft&#x27;s total capacity remained the same. It made its first flight in July, but the factory flight tests were not completed until early 1948. Despite a top speed of at , it failed its state acceptance tests. The reasons given were that the engines continued to flame out if they were run at low rpm at altitudes above , the mounts for the cannon were not fully developed and the workmanship of the pressurized cockpit was low. The real reason was that the aircraft was inferior to the MiG-15 already in flight testing.

Another re-engined version of the MiG-9 was the I-320 (&quot;izdeliye&quot; FN). It had an imported Rolls-Royce Nene I centrifugal-flow turbojet rated at and the armament was rearranged yet again in another attempt to eliminate the gas ingestion problem. The N-37 cannon was moved to the underside of the fuselage and the NS-23 guns were moved to each side of the fuselage as in the I-305, although none of the gun barrels protruded past the lips of the air intakes. Construction began in late 1947, but it was never completed as the MiG-15 prototype used the same engine and had a higher performance.

One MiG-9 (&quot;izdeliye&quot; FK) was modified in 1949 to serve as a testbed for the KS-1 Komet air-launched anti-shipping cruise missile. A second unpressurized cockpit was built in line with the trailing edge of the wing for the guidance system operator. The aircraft was fitted with two radars, a K-1M target illumination radar in a prominent bullet-shaped fairing above the air intakes and an aft-looking radar mounted in a cigar-shaped fairing at the top of the vertical stabilizer. This latter system was intended to test the mid-course guidance system of the launching aircraft and the guidance systems of the missile. Signals from the K-1M radar were received in small bullet-shaped fairings on the leading edges of the wings. The aircraft served in this role for four years, until the missile passed its state acceptance trials in 1952–53.

==Operational history==
The MiG-9 was flown in Soviet service by fighter regiments in the 1st, 7th, 14th, 15th, and 16th Air Armies. These last two were based near Kaliningrad and in East Germany respectively. In addition, the 177th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 303rd Aviation Division near Yaroslavl flew the aircraft in 1949.

Six divisions of MiG-9s, each with two regiments of 31 aircraft, were transferred to China in November–December 1950 for air defense and training duties. The 17th Guards Fighter Aviation Division (GIAD) defended Shenyang, the 20th Fighter Aviation Division (IAD) guarded Tangshan, and the 65th IAD protected Guangzhou. The 144th IAD defended Shanghai, the 309th guarded Gongzhuling and the 328th IAD protected Peking. These units later handed their aircraft over to the 6th, 7th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 17th Fighter Divisions of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force when their training was complete. The Chinese considered sending their MiG-9s to Korea in 1951 under Soviet pressure, but reconsidered when the PLAAF commanders reported that they believed that it would be better to retrain MiG-9 pilots on MiG-15s.

<text>An arterial blood gas (ABG) test, or arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) measures the amounts of arterial gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. An ABG test requires that a small volume of blood be drawn from the radial artery with a syringe and a thin needle, but sometimes the femoral artery in the groin or another site is used. The blood can also be drawn from an arterial catheter.

An ABG test measures the blood gas tension values of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), and the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and the blood&#x27;s pH. In addition, the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) can be determined. Such information is vital when caring for patients with critical illnesses or respiratory disease. Therefore, the ABG test is one of the most common tests performed on patients in intensive-care units. In other levels of care, pulse oximetry plus transcutaneous carbon-dioxide measurement is a less invasive, alternative method of obtaining similar information.

An ABG test can indirectly measure the level of bicarbonate in the blood. The bicarbonate level is calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Many blood-gas analyzers will also report concentrations of lactate, hemoglobin, several electrolytes, oxyhemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin, and methemoglobin. ABG testing is mainly used in pulmonology and critical-care medicine to determine gas exchange across the alveolar-capillary membrane. ABG testing also has a variety of applications in other areas of medicine. Combinations of disorders can be complex and difficult to interpret, so calculators, nomograms, and rules of thumb are commonly used.

ABG samples originally were sent from the clinic to the medical laboratory for analysis. Newer equipment lets the analysis be done also as point-of-care testing, depending on the equipment available in each clinic.

==Sampling and analysis==
Arterial blood for blood-gas analysis is usually drawn by a respiratory therapist and sometimes a phlebotomist, a nurse, a paramedic or a doctor. Blood is most commonly drawn from the radial artery because it is easily accessible, can be compressed to control bleeding, and has less risk for vascular occlusion. The selection of which radial artery to draw from is based on the outcome of an Allen&#x27;s test. The brachial artery (or less often, the femoral artery) is also used, especially during emergency situations or with children. Blood can also be taken from an arterial catheter already placed in one of these arteries.

There are plastic and glass syringes used for blood gas samples. Most syringes come pre-packaged and contain a small amount of heparin, to prevent coagulation. Other syringes may need to be heparinised, by drawing up a small amount of liquid heparin and squirting it out again to remove air bubbles. Once the sample is obtained,&lt;ref name=&quot;geekymedics/agbS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; care is taken to eliminate visible gas bubbles, as these bubbles can dissolve into the sample and cause inaccurate results. The sealed syringe is taken to a blood gas analyzer. If a plastic blood gas syringe is used, the sample should be transported and kept at room temperature and analyzed within 30 min. If prolonged time delays are expected (i.e., greater than 30 min) prior to analysis, the sample should be drawn in a glass syringe and immediately placed on ice. Standard blood tests can also be performed on arterial blood, such as measuring glucose, lactate, hemoglobins, dyshemoglobins, bilirubin and electrolytes.

Derived parameters include bicarbonate concentration, SaO2, and base excess. Bicarbonate concentration is calculated from the measured pH and PCO2 using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. SaO2 is derived from the measured PO2 and calculated based on the assumption that all measured hemoglobin is normal (oxy- or deoxy-) hemoglobin.

===Calculations===

The machine used for analysis aspirates this blood from the syringe and measures the pH and the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The bicarbonate concentration is also calculated. These results are usually available for interpretation within five minutes.

Two methods have been used in medicine in the management of blood gases of patients in hypothermia: pH-stat method and alpha-stat method. Recent studies suggest that the α-stat method is superior.
* pH-stat: The pH and other ABG results are measured at the patient&#x27;s actual temperature. The goal is to maintain a pH of 7.40 and the arterial carbon dioxide tension (paCO2) at 5.3 kPa (40 mmHg) at the actual patient temperature. It is necessary to add CO2 to the oxygenator to accomplish this goal.
* α-stat (alpha-stat): The pH and other ABG results are measured at 37 °C, despite the patient&#x27;s actual temperature. The goal is to maintain the arterial carbon dioxide tension at 5.3 kPa (40mmHg) and the pH at 7.40 when measured at +37 °C.

Both the pH-stat and alpha-stat strategies have theoretical disadvantages. α-stat method is the method of choice for optimal myocardial function. The pH-stat method may result in loss of autoregulation in the brain (coupling of the cerebral blood flow with the metabolic rate in the brain). By increasing the cerebral blood flow beyond the metabolic requirements, the pH-stat method may lead to cerebral microembolisation and intracranial hypertension.

===Guidelines===
# A 1 mmHg change in PaCO2 above or below 40 mmHg results in 0.008 unit change in pH in the opposite direction.
# The PaCO2 will decrease by about 1 mmHg for every 1 mEq/L reduction in [] below 24 mEq/L
# A change in [] of 10 mEq/L will result in a change in pH of approximately 0.15 pH units in the same direction.
# Assess relation of pCO2 with pH: If pCO2 &amp; pH are moving in opposite directions i.e., pCO2 ↑ when pH is &lt;7.4 or pCO2 ↓ when pH &gt; 7.4, it is a primary respiratory disorder. If pCO2 &amp; pH are moving in same direction i.e., pCO2 ↑when pH is &gt;7.4 or pCO2 ↓ when pH &lt; 7.4, it is a primary metabolic disorder.

==Parameters and reference ranges==

These are typical reference ranges, although various analysers and laboratories may employ different ranges.
Contamination of the sample with room air will result in abnormally low carbon dioxide and possibly elevated oxygen levels, and a concurrent elevation in pH. Delaying analysis (without chilling the sample) may result in inaccurately low oxygen and high carbon dioxide levels as a result of ongoing cellular respiration.

===pH===

The normal range for pH is 7.35–7.45. As the pH decreases (&lt; 7.35), it implies acidosis, while if the pH increases (&gt; 7.45) it implies alkalosis. In the context of arterial blood gases, the most common occurrence will be that of respiratory acidosis. Carbon dioxide is dissolved in the blood as carbonic acid, a weak acid; however, in large concentrations, it can affect the pH drastically. Whenever there is poor pulmonary ventilation, the carbon dioxide levels in the blood are expected to rise. This leads to a rise of carbonic acid, leading to a decrease in pH. The first buffer of pH will be the plasma proteins, since these can accept some H+ ions to try to maintain acid-base homeostasis. As carbon dioxide concentrations continue to increase (&quot;Pa&quot;CO2 &gt; 45 mmHg), a condition known as respiratory acidosis occurs. The body tries to maintain homeostasis by increasing the respiratory rate, a condition known as tachypnea. This allows much more carbon dioxide to escape the body through the lungs, thus increasing the pH by having less carbonic acid. If a person is in a critical setting and intubated, one must increase the number of breaths mechanically.

Respiratory alkalosis (&quot;Pa&quot; CO2 &lt; 35 mmHg) occurs when there is too little carbon dioxide in the blood. This may be due to hyperventilation or else excessive breaths given via a mechanical ventilator in a critical care setting. The action to be taken is to calm the person and try to reduce the number of breaths being taken to normalize the pH. The respiratory pathway tries to compensate for the change in pH in a matter of 2–4 hours. If this is not enough, the metabolic pathway takes place.

Under normal conditions, the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation will give the blood pH

:formula_1
where:
* 6.1 is the acid dissociation constant (p&quot;K&quot;a) of carbonic acid () at normal body temperature
* [] is the concentration of bicarbonate in the blood in mEq/L
* &quot;Pa&quot;CO2 is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood in mmHg

The kidney and the lung are two main organs responsible for the metabolic homeostasis of pH. Bicarbonate is a base that helps to accept excess hydrogen ions whenever there is acidaemia. However, this mechanism is slower than the respiratory pathway and may take from a few hours to 3 days to take effect. In acidaemia, the bicarbonate levels rise, so that they can neutralize the excess acid, while the contrary happens when there is alkalaemia. Thus when an arterial blood gas test reveals, for example, an elevated bicarbonate, the problem has been present for a couple of days, and metabolic compensation took place over a blood acidaemia problem.

In general, it is much easier to correct acute pH derangement by adjusting respiration. Metabolic compensations take place at a much later stage. However, in a critical setting, a person with a normal pH, a high CO2, and a high bicarbonate means that, although there is a high carbon dioxide level, there is metabolic compensation. As a result, one must be careful as to not artificially adjust breaths to lower the carbon dioxide. In such case, lowering the carbon dioxide abruptly means that the bicarbonate will be in excess and will cause a metabolic alkalosis. In such a case, carbon dioxide levels should be slowly diminished.

==Arterial versus venous blood==

Since the advent of pulse oximetry which measures oxygen saturation transcutaneously and is non-invasive, arterial blood is seldom used for the determination of oxygenation outside the ICU. Acid base status can be determined with venous blood precluding the pain and inconvenience of arterial blood sampling in most cases. When an indwelling arterial line catheter is present, arterial blood is easy to obtain and still used. Venous blood is generally used otherwise, usually from a peripheral vein, such as a forearm vein. 
The values of pH and HCO3 of venous blood are close enough to arterial blood for direct comparison. The pCO2 of venous blood is less reliably compared to arterial blood but may be used in some cases. The PO2 level of venous blood is always significantly lower that arterial and should be reported, labeled and interpreted as venous PO2.

<text>A blood gas test or blood gas analysis tests blood to measure blood gas tension values and blood pH. It also measures the level and base excess of bicarbonate. The source of the blood is reflected in the name of each test; arterial blood gases come from arteries, venous blood gases come from veins and capillary blood gases come from capillaries. The blood gas tension levels of partial pressures can be used as indicators of ventilation, respiration and oxygenation. Analysis of paired arterial and venous specimens can give insights into the aetiology of acidosis in the newborn.

==Values measured==

Blood samples for testing are taken from arterial blood by a radial artery puncture, and from venous blood by venipuncture. Samples of capillary blood are taken using a lancet and capillary action. Capillary samples from the earlobe or the fingertip can be used to predict blood pH and the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood. Samples from the earlobe are seen to be a more appropriate site for the prediction of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen.

Blood gas tests also measure the levels of bicarbonate and standard bicarbonate, base excess, oxygen saturation, and pH. Typically, an arterial blood gas test is used more often than venous blood gas tests.

==Clinical significance==
Blood gas tests can be used in the diagnosis of a number of acidosis conditions such as lactic, metabolic, and respiratory acidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, and also of respiratory alkalosis. Particularly, umbilical cord blood gas analysis can give an indication of preceding fetal hypoxic stress. In combination with other clinical information, normal paired arterial and venous cord blood gas results can usually provide a robust defence against a suggestion that an infant had an intrapartum hypoxic-ischaemic event.

Abnormal results may be due to a wide range of diseases, including poisoning and trauma as well as lung, kidney, or metabolic diseases. Drug overdose and uncontrolled diabetes may be determined from abnormal results. Head, neck or injuries that affect breathing can also lead to abnormal results.

<text>The Mikoyan-Gurevich I-250 (Samolet N), aka MiG-13, was a Soviet fighter aircraft developed as part of a crash program in 1944 to develop a high-performance fighter to counter German turbojet-powered aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Me 262. The Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau decided to focus on a design that used something more mature than the jet engine, which was still at an experimental stage in the Soviet Union, and chose a mixed-power solution with the VRDK (&quot;Vozdushno-Reaktivny Dvigatel Kompressornyi&quot; – air reaction compressor jet) motorjet powered by the Klimov VK-107 V12 engine. While quite successful when it worked, with a maximum speed of being reached during trials, production problems with the VRDK fatally delayed the program and it was canceled in 1948 as obsolete.

==Design and development==
By January 1944 the Soviets were aware of successful British and American jet aircraft projects and that the Germans were about to deploy jet and rocket-propelled aircraft of their own. The GKO ordered on 18 February that the NKAP (People&#x27;s Commissariat for Aviation Industry) centralize jet research under its control and that the NKAP was to present proposals to alleviate the situation within a month. As a result of this meeting the NKAP ordered the Lavochkin, Sukhoi, Yakovlev and Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureaus (OKBs) to develop and build jet aircraft with the utmost dispatch. Aware of earlier problems encountered with other novel propulsion systems such as ramjets both Sukhoi and Mikoyan-Gurevich chose to use the VRDK booster engine that had been under development since 1942.

The VRDK was a motorjet, a rudimentary type of jet engine where an external power source drove the engine&#x27;s compressor. It forced air into the stainless steel combustion chamber where fuel was sprayed from seven nozzles and ignited to exhaust out the variable rear nozzle. In the I-250 a Klimov VK-107R V-12 piston engine was used as the primary powerplant. After takeoff a clutch at the end of the crankshaft could be engaged which drove a step up gearbox with a ratio of 13:21 to an extension shaft that powered the compressor of the VRDK. The air for the compressor was fed through a long duct that ran from the inlet underneath the propeller spinner, thence under the engine and through the belly of the aircraft. This duct also fed air to the oil cooler near the engine, but the water radiator was positioned behind the compressor to maximize airflow over it. A secondary duct led from the main duct to the VK-107&#x27;s supercharger; when the VRDK was running the secondary duct diverted some of that additional air to the supercharger which boosted the engine&#x27;s output to at . The increased airflow over the engine radiator helped to dump the engine&#x27;s excess heat into the exhaust stream. However the VRDK was limited to only ten minutes&#x27; operating time per sortie, which meant that it was useless weight during the rest of the flight.

The I-250 was a low-wing, all-metal aircraft with a monocoque fuselage. Other than the VRDK the aircraft was largely conventional in layout, although the cockpit was set very far back in the fuselage, almost to the base of the vertical tail. The two-spar wings had a thickness of 10% to preserve aileron control and avoid tip stall. They were fitted with Frise ailerons and slotted flaps. Fuel was contained in a fuselage tank and a tank in each wing. The conventional landing gear mainwheels had a levered suspension and retracted inwards. The tail wheel retracted aft into the very small ventral fin. The VK-107A engine initially drove a VISh-105SV propeller.

The NKAP had asked Mikoyan to begin preliminary design work on a high-altitude interceptor in January 1944, but ordered two prototypes of an all-metal interceptor using the VRDK for testing in February and March 1945. The aircraft was to reach an altitude of in 4.5 minutes with full power and 5.5 minutes using the piston engine alone. Its maximum speed was to be at with full power and at using the VK-107 by itself. Its intended armament was one autocannon and two machine guns. To assist Mikoyan TsAGI was ordered to provide help with aerodynamic and stress calculations and to test a full-size mockup in their wind tunnel in one month&#x27;s time. TsIAM was ordered to deliver three VRDK engines with at with a specific fuel consumption of per hour. The plane was designated I-250 by the NKAP; but the internal OKB designation was N.

The NKAP approved the preliminary specifications of the I-250 on 19 September 1944 which included a maximum speed of a take-off weight of and a time to of 3.9 minutes. A mock-up was inspected on 26 October and rejected because of the poor cockpit layout, although this decision was reversed because the fuselage of the first prototype was too far along for major changes that would have significantly delayed the program. That same month the combustion chamber was sent to TsIAM for testing which revealed it to be too weak. The complete powerplant was tested in December, but the drive shaft connecting them failed several times.

The first prototype was completed on 26 February 1945, although the VRDK was not yet ready. It was fitted with a new AV-10P-60 propeller before making its first flight on 4 April according to Gordon and Komissarov, although Belyakov and Marmain say 3 March. It was armed with three 20 mm Berezin B-20 cannon with 160 rounds each. One gun was fitted on each side of the nose and the third fired through the hollow propeller shaft. The VRDK was tested for the first time on 8 April in a dive, attaining a speed of , but a leak was found in the oil cooler after landing and the VRDK had to be returned to the factory for repairs. The VRDK was reinstalled by 14 April, but was still troublesome. It twice reached at about during these early tests, but its service life had been exceeded by 30 May and it had to be returned to TsIAM, which postponed any further tests until the second aircraft was finished.

The unarmed second prototype was completed on 19 May, but did not make its first flight until 26 May. It was later discovered to have several major defects, including an oil leak from the VRDK compressor&#x27;s sleeve. The VRDK&#x27;s designer was summoned in an attempt to solve its problems although not all of these were design issues. The first prototype was grounded for most of June to remedy magneto problems and to add extra air intakes to cool the spark plugs. It attained a speed of at on 3 July. Unfortunately its port tailplane failed at low altitude two days later, killing the test pilot, Alexandr Deyev, when his parachute failed to open in time. Post-crash analysis revealed that he had exceeded the airframe&#x27;s G limit while maneuvering.

Despite the accident, a pre-production batch of ten aircraft was ordered on 27 July 1945 as it was felt that mixed-power aircraft would be of some use easing the transition of pilots from piston-engine fighters to jet-engined ones. At the same time Sukhoi&#x27;s Su-5 was cancelled as it was judged inferior to the I-250.

In the meantime the horizontal stabilizer of the second prototype was strengthened and it resumed flying on 20 July. The pilot complained of excess torque pull to the right so the vertical stabilizer was enlarged by , but this was just one of numerous problems, and it was not ready to pass State acceptance trials without more development work on the powerplant. However, the second prototype continued flight testing until 12 July 1946 when an engine fire forced an emergency landing and it was damaged beyond repair.

The order for the pre-production I-250s had been placed with Factory No. 381 in Moscow for two aircraft to be delivered in September, three more in October and the remainder by the end of the year. This proved to be very optimistic and it was revised to a single aircraft by the end of the year. The airframe was completed on this revised schedule, but its engine was not ready in time. The factory management was much criticized for these problems which were not entirely under their control as changes to the design and drawings were constant. The criticism was not limited to just the I-250 program as the other jet programs could not be developed as fast as the leadership wanted as well and Alexei Shakhurin, the head of MAP (Ministry of Aviation Industry) and its NKAP predecessor since 1940, was arrested in March 1946 as a sign of their displeasure. The new Minister severely reprimanded the designer of the VRDK and three factory directors on 13 April 1946 and set up a commission to determine why Factory No. 381 and TsIAM had failed to meet their deadlines. He refused to accept its findings as it apportioned blame fairly evenly among those responsible for the production program and he had the director of Factory No. 381 and his quality control manager arrested for industrial sabotage.

Despite these production problems and the fact that the I-250 had yet even to be submitted for State acceptance trails, an order had been placed for fifty more aircraft on 26 February (these aircraft have been referred to as the MiG-13, which presumably would have been their designation if they had actually entered service). A new deadline of 5 July 1946 was set for the delivery of the first pre-production aircraft, but it was stymied, again, for a lack of an engine. By this time seven airframes had been completed, but all lacked engines. The first I-250 was finally accepted on 8 August and flown for the first time three days later, although its engine seals failed and a number of ignition cables were scorched. The engine replacement and repairs forced the aircraft to miss its scheduled appearance at the Tushino Air Display. It was handed over to the NII VVS (Air Force Scientific Test Institute) on 15 September to finally begin its State acceptance tests. All ten aircraft had been delivered by 30 October, although construction number 3810107 (Factory No. 381, first batch, seventh aircraft) was used as a static test airframe and 3810110 became a static engine testbed.

Joseph Stalin convened a meeting on 29 November 1946 to settle the future policy on jet fighters for the VVS and PVO. The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9 was selected as the primary fighter with the Yakovlev Yak-15 relegated to conversion training and familiarization. The imminent availability of British jet engines and access to German jet technology and engineers meant that there was no longer any need for mixed-power aircraft, but Stalin insisted that the I-250 finish its trials and that the tooling and drawings should be retained along with unassembled parts even though the program was cancelled.

Completion of the trials would be delayed until May 1947 when the trials of the VRDK itself would be completed and Mikoyan tried to sell the aircraft to Naval Aviation for use as escorts for torpedo bombers. Additional fuel tanks were fitted in the wings and fuselage of 3810102 to carry an additional of fuel and the capacity of the oil tank was increased to . These changes increased its empty weight to and its take-off weight to . A new round of State trials began on 9 October 1947, but these were delayed by bad weather and reliability issues. Only six flights totaling two hours and twenty-five minutes had been completed by 21 January 1948 and the VRDK had only been run for a minute and half during a ground test. The I-250 was unsurprisingly declared to have failed the trials on 3 April 1948.

<text>Albert Ernest Knight (8 October 1872 – 25 April 1946) was an English professional cricket player. He was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys.

From 1895 until 1912 he played for Leicestershire as a somewhat dour batsman in a generally weak team. He represented England in three matches of the 1903–04 Ashes series against Australia, with a highest score of 70 not out at Sydney. He had had his most successful domestic season in 1903, scoring 1834 runs at an average of 45.85, including his highest score of 229 not out against Worcestershire.

A. A. Thomson saw his innings of 147 against Yorkshire at Sheffield when Leicestershire were following-on, made in his final season of 1912. He wrote: &quot;His batting was unencumbered by frills, but strong and solid, attuned to the difficulties of the situation. Albert was a man of admirable character and a Methodist local preacher.&quot;

His most important contribution to the game was a book, &quot;The Complete Cricketer&quot;, published in 1906. Sir Derek Birley, in his &quot;A Social History of English Cricket&quot;, described it as &quot;a masterpiece of its kind, stuffed full of learned observations in weighty prose&quot;. &quot;Wisden&quot; called it &quot;grandiose in style, containing much startling metaphor&quot;.

After retirement, Knight was cricket coach at Highgate School, where his portrait in oils was painted by the art teacher, Kyffin Williams.

<text>Solferino (Upper Mantovano: ) is a small town and municipality in the province of Mantua, Lombardy, northern Italy, approximately south of Lake Garda.

It is best known as being close to the site of the Battle of Solferino on 24 June 1859, part of the Second Italian War of Independence. The battle ended with Italo-French capture of the &quot;Rocca&quot;, the fortress then in Austrian hands.

The Battle of Solferino was the largest battle since Leipzig in 1813, with more than 234,000 soldiers fighting for about 12–14 hours and 29,000 victims (14,000 Austrians-Venetians and 15,000 Franco-Sardinians) and about 10,000 prisoners (8,000 Austrians-Venetians and 2,000 Franco-Sardinians). In terms of death toll, it was greater than the Battle of Waterloo.

The wounded in the battle were witnessed by the Swiss businessman Jean-Henri Dunant, who had traveled to Italy to meet French emperor Napoleon III with the intention of discussing difficulties in conducting business in Algeria, at that time occupied by France.

Horrified by the suffering of wounded soldiers left on the battlefield, Dunant completely abandoned the original intent of his trip and for several days he devoted himself to helping with the treatment and care for the wounded. He succeeded in organizing an overwhelming level of relief assistance by motivating the local villagers to aid without discrimination.

Back in his home in Geneva, he set about a process that led to the Geneva Conventions and the establishment of the International Committee of the Red Cross by writing a book entitled &quot;A Memory of Solferino&quot;, which he published with his own money in 1862 and thus initiated the process.

From 23 to 28 June 2009, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the battle, a series of events gathering thousands of Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement volunteers from all around the world took place in Solferino, under the name of Solferino 2009 Celebrations.

== Location ==
Solferino is a town located at the northern foothills of the Po Valley, in Upper Mantua and on the border with the province of Brescia.

The municipal territory, extending for 13.08 km2, is part of the Morainic amphitheatre of Lake Garda, located a few kilometres to the north. The altitude at the town hall is 124 m above sea level. Not far away also lies the province of Verona, with the towns of Peschiera del Garda and Valeggio sul Mincio, only a few kilometres to the east.

It is 35 km from Mantua (provincial capital), 40 km from Brescia and 45 km from Verona.

It is bordered to the north by Brescia (Lonato del Garda), to the east by Cavriana, to the south by Guidizzolo, to the south-west by Medole and to the west by Castiglione delle Stiviere.

== Origins of the name ==
The origins of the name are to be found in the medieval adjective &quot;sulphurinus&quot;, which probably refer to a sulfurous stream, with probable reference to the sulfurous emanations of the morainic amphitheatre of Garda.

== Main sights ==

* The Rocca di Solferino, known as the &quot;Spy of Italy&quot;, 23 metres high, erected in 1022. Inside memorabilia are found of the battle fought on June 24, 1859. The Società Solferino e San Martino, a body founded in 1870, takes care of its protection and conservation. 
* The Red Cross Memorial, erected in 1959, in memory of the founder of the Red Cross Jean Henry Dunant.
* Piazza Castello, where the Castle of Orazio Gonzaga was erected. 
* Monument to the Unification of Italy.

== Museums ==

* The ossuary of Solferino, 1870.
* The Museum of the Risorgimento of Solferino and San Martino, created in 1931, occupies three rooms where testimonies of the battle of 24 June 1859 are housed. This exhibition space collects material from the entire Risorgimento period, from the Napoleonic era to the Third War of Independence. 
* Museo La Rocca, known as the &quot;Spy of Italy&quot; because of its dominant position on the Lombardy-Veneto border.

== Events ==
Every year in the village there is the spring festival and the children&#x27;s market, a market of arts and crafts of daily life with narratives and animation. In addition, in June, there is the now famous Beer Festival, a great attraction for the young public of the provinces of Mantua, Brescia, Verona.

Periodically historical reenactments of the Battle of Solferino and San Martino are organized. On the occasion of the 150th anniversary, it was held on 28 June 2009.

Furthermore, every year on the weekend closest to 24 June, in memory of the battle witnessed by Henry Dunant and which inspired him to create the International Red Cross, there are a series of events organised by the association itself in which members can attend various courses, culminating with a suggestive torch-lit procession commemorated on the Saturday evening, from the square of the church of Solferino to Castiglione delle Stiviere.

==Twin towns==
Solferino is twinned with:

* Solférino, France, since 1963
* Châtillon-sur-Indre, France, since 2003

<text>The Brazilian Space Agency (; AEB) is the civilian authority in Brazil responsible for the country&#x27;s space program. It operates a spaceport at Alcântara, and a rocket launch site at Barreira do Inferno. It is the largest and most prominent space agency in Latin America.

The Brazilian Space Agency is the institutional successor of Brazil&#x27;s space program, which had been managed by the Brazilian military until its transfer to civilian control on 10 February 1994. It suffered a major setback in 2003, when a rocket explosion killed 21 technicians. Brazil successfully launched its first rocket into space, the VSB-30, on 23 October 2004 from the Alcântara Launch Center; several other successful launches have followed. Brazil was briefly a partner in the International Space Station, and in 2006, AEB astronaut Marcos Pontes became the first Brazilian and the first native Portuguese-speaker to go into space, when he arrived at the ISS for a week. During his trip, Pontes carried out eight experiments selected by the Brazilian Space Agency, including testing flight dynamics of saw blades in zero gravity environments. In June 2021, the AEB signed the Artemis Accords to the joint exploration of the Moon and Mars from 2024 as part of the Artemis program.

==History==
The then president Jânio Quadros in 1960 established a commission that elaborated a national program for the space exploration. As a result of this work, in August 1961, the Organization Group of the National Commission of Space Activities (Portuguese: &quot;Grupo de Organização da Comissão Nacional de Atividades Espaciais&quot;) was formed, operating in São José dos Campos, in the state of São Paulo. Its researchers participated in international projects in the areas of astronomy, geodesy, geomagnetism, and meteorology.

The GOCNAE was replaced in April 1971 by the Institute for Space Research, currently called the National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Since the creation of the then Technical Center of Aeronautics (CTA), the current Department of Aerospace Science and Technology (DCTA) of the Brazilian Air Force, in 1946, the country has been following the international progress in the aerospace sector.

With the creation of the Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA), a fully qualified institution was formed to train highly qualified human resources in areas of state-of-the-art technology. The DCTA, through the ITA and the Institute of Aeronautics and Space (IAE), play a key role in the consolidation of the Brazilian space program.

In the early 1970s, the Brazilian Space Activities Commission (COBAE) was created - a body linked to the then General Staff of the Armed Forces (EMFA) - to coordinate and monitor the implementation of the space program. This coordinating role, in February 1994, was transferred to the Brazilian Space Agency. The creation of the AEB represents a change in government orientation by establishing a central coordinating body for the space program, reporting directly to the Presidency of the Republic.

In 2011, Argentina&#x27;s defense minister, Arturo Puricelli, made a proposal to the Brazilian minister, Celso Amorim, for the creation of a unified South American space agency by the year 2025, according to the European Space Agency.

In 2015, however, the Brazilian Space Agency and the Ministry of Defense rejected the Argentine proposal &quot;because it understood that it would be an organ that would yield a lot of bureaucracy and few results like the &#x27;confederation&#x27; proposed by the United States and never came to anything&quot; and also because, according to the agency&#x27;s adviser: 

==Launch sites==
===Alcântara Space Center===

The Alcântara Launch Center (; CLA) is the main launch site and operational center of the Brazilian Space Agency. It is located in the peninsula of Alcântara, in the state of Maranhão. This region presents some excellent requirements, such as low population density, excellent security conditions and easiness of aerial and maritime access. The most important factor is its closeness to the Equator - Alcântara is the closest launching base to the Equator. This gives the launch site a significant advantage in launching geosynchronous satellites.

===Barreira do Inferno Launch Center===

The Barreira do Inferno Launch Center (; CLBI) is a rocket launch base of the Brazilian Space Agency. It is located in the city of Parnamirim, in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. It is primarily used to launch sounding rockets and to support the Alcântara Launch Center.

==Launch vehicles==
===Sounding rockets===

The Brazilian Space Agency has operated a series of sounding rockets.
* Sonda I
* Sonda II
* Sonda III
* Sonda IV
* VSB-30
* VS-30
* VS-40
* VS-50 (projected, will use the new S-50 rocket engine)

===VLM===
Brazil has forged a cooperative arrangement with Germany to develop a dedicated micro-satellite launch vehicle. As a result, the VLM &quot;Veiculo Lançador de Microsatelites&quot; (Microsatellite Launch Vehicle) based on the S50 rocket engine is being studied, with the objective of orbiting satellites up to 150 kg in circular orbits ranging from 250 to 700 km. The first qualifying and test flight will be on 2022 from the Alcântara Space Center. The second flight is scheduled for the following years as part of the SHEFEX mission, to be conducted also from Alcântara, in partnership with the German Aerospace Center (DLR).

===VLS===

The VLS - Satellite Launch Vehicle () was the Brazilian Space Agency&#x27;s main satellite launch vehicle. It is a four-stage rocket composed of a core and four strap-on motors. The vehicle&#x27;s first stage has four solid fuel motors derived from the Sonda sounding rockets. It is intended to deploy 100 to 380 kg satellites into 200 to 1200 km orbit, or to deploy 75 to 275 kg payloads into 200 to 1000 km polar orbit. The first 3 prototypes for the vehicle failed to launch, with the 3rd exploding on the launch pad in 2003 resulting in the deaths of 21 AEB personnel.

The VLS-1 V4 prototype was expected a launch in 2013. After subsequent delays, the project was cancelled in 2016.

====Southern Cross program====
The Brazilian Space Agency was developing a new family of launch vehicles in cooperation with the Russian Federal Space Agency. The five rockets of the Southern Cross family will be based on Russia&#x27;s Angara vehicle and liquid-propellant engines.

The first stage of the VLS Gama, Delta and Epsilon rockets was to be powered by a unit based on the RD-191 engine. The second stage, which will be the same for all the Southern Cross rockets, will be driven by an engine based on the Molniya rocket. The third stage will be a solid-propellant booster based on an upgraded version of the VLS-1. The program was named &quot;Southern Cross&quot; in reference to the Crux constellation, present on the flag of Brazil and composed of five stars. Hence the names of the future launch vehicles:
*VLS Alfa (light-weight rocket)

The first rocket to be developed. As a direct modification of the VLS-1 of the original project, replacing the fourth and fifth stages by a single liquid fuel engine. It can place payloads in the range 200–400 kg in orbits up to 750 km.
*VLS Beta (light-weight rocket)

Consisting of three stages without auxiliary thrusters. The first stage is a solid fuel propellant 40 tons, the second will have 30 tons of thrust engine and the latter will be 7.5 tons of thrust, with the same mixture &quot;Kerolox&quot;. It can place payloads up to 800 kg in orbits up to 800 km.
*VLS Gama (light-weight rocket)

The VLS Gama launcher is part of the light-weight class, but using the near-equatorial position of the Alcântara Launch Center, it can place almost 1 ton of payload into orbit up to 800 km.
*VLS Delta (medium-weight rocket)

The VLS Delta launcher is a medium-weight rocket and differs from the Gamma by having four solid-propellant boosters attached to the first stage. Its payload deliverable to a geostationary orbit is 2 tons.
*VLS Epsilon (heavy-weight rocket)

The VLS Epsilon launcher is a heavy-weight rocket with three identical units attached to the first stage. It can place a 4 tons spacecraft in geostationary orbit, if it is launched from Alcântara.

The Brazilian government was planning to allocate $1 billion dollars for the project over six years. It has already set aside $650 million for the construction of five launch pads able to handle up to 12 launches per year. The program was scheduled to be completed by 2022. However, it was cancelled by Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. Instead, Brazil will focus on a series of smaller launch vehicles that appear to rely more on home-grown technology.

===14-X===
Brazil is also investing in the domain of the hypersonic technology. The 14-X, a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) under development with the Brazilian Air Force, was conceived in 2007 and launched on 14 February 2022, by a VSB-30 rocket, reaching to 100,000 feet of altitude and a maximum speed of Mach 10.

==Engines==

A number of different engines were developed for usage on the several launch vehicles:
* S-10-1 solid rocket engine. Used on Sonda 1. Thrust: 27 kN.
* S-10-2 solid rocket engine. Used on Sonda 1. Thrust: 4.20 kN, burn time: 32 s.

==Satellites==
The Brazilian Space Agency has several active satellites in orbit including imagery intelligence, military communications, reconnaissance and Earth observation satellites. Several others are currently in development.

==Human spaceflight==
Marcos Pontes, a lieutenant colonel in the Brazilian Air Force, is an astronaut of the Brazilian Space Agency. Pontes was the first Brazilian astronaut, having launched with the Expedition 13 crew from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on March 29, 2006, aboard a Soyuz-TMA spacecraft. Pontes docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on March 31, 2006, where he lived and worked for 9 days. Pontes returned to Earth with the Expedition 12 crew, landing in Kazakhstan on April 8, 2006. In January 2019, Pontes was nominated by the Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro as Minister of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communication, a position he held until 2022.

==Brazilian aerospace command==

The Aerospace Operations Command ( - COMAE) is a Brazilian air and space command created in 2017 which is part of the Brazilian Air Force. The command is responsible for planning, coordinating, executing and controlling the country&#x27;s air and space operations. The Brazilian Navy and Brazilian Army also are part of the organization.

==Space operations center==

The Space Operations Center (Portuguese: &quot;Centro de Operações Espaciais&quot;, acronym COPE) is a facility established in 2020 subordinated to the Aerospace Operations Command, with the objective of operating and supervising the Brazilian satellites.

==Bingo radio telescope==
The Bingo radio telescope called &quot;Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations&quot;, is a project coordinated by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Brazilian Space Agency, National Institute for Space Research (INPE) and international partners from Europe and China. The telescope will consist of two giant dishes, with 40 meters of diameter each, which will receive radiation from the space and project their spectrum in a series of metal detectors, called &quot;horns&quot;. Bingo will perform its detections in the radio band in the range of 960 to 1260 MHZ. 80% of the Bingo parts came from the Brazilian industry.

==International cooperation==
===China/CBERS===
China and Brazil have successfully cooperated in the field of space. Among the most successful space cooperation projects were the development and launch of earth monitoring satellites. The China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program (CBERS) is a technological cooperation program between Brazil and China which develops and operates Earth observation satellites.
Brazil and China negotiated the CBERS project during two years (1986–1988), renewed in 1994 and again in 2004. As of 2023, the two countries have jointly developed six China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellites. These projects have helped both Brazil and China develop their access to satellite imagery and promoted remote sensing research. Brazil and China&#x27;s cooperation is a unique example of South-South cooperation between two developing countries in the field of space.

===International Space Station===

The Brazilian Space Agency is a bilateral partner of NASA in the International Space Station. The agreement for the design, development, operation and use of Brazilian developed flight equipment and payloads for the Space Station was signed in 1997. It includes the development of six items, among which are a Window Observational Research Facility and a Technology Experiment Facility. In return, NASA will provide Brazil with access to its ISS facilities on-orbit, as well as a flight opportunity for one Brazilian astronaut during the course of the ISS program.
However, due to cost issues, the subcontractor Embraer was unable to provide the promised ExPrESS pallet, and Brazil left the programme in 2007. However, as a compromise, NASA have funded small Brazilian-made components for the Express Logistics Carrier-2 for the ISS, which were installed in 2009.

===Ukraine/Ciclone 4===
On October 21, 2003, the Brazilian Space Agency and the State Space Agency of Ukraine established a cooperation agreement creating a joint venture space enterprise called Alcântara Cyclone Space. The new company will focus on launching satellites from the Alcântara Launch Center using the Tsyklon-4 rocket. The company will invest $160 million dollars in infrastructure for the new launch pad that will be constructed at the Alcântara Launch Center.

In March 2009, the Brazilian Government increased its financial capital by US$ 50 million.

The first launch was planned for 2014 from the Alcantara Launch Center.

Brazil pulled out of the program in 2015.

===Japan===
On November 8, 2010, National Institute for Space Research (INPE) and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) signed a Letter of Intent regarding the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD+) program. Examples of the cooperation include the monitoring of illegal logging in the Amazon rainforest utilizing data from JAXA&#x27;s ALOS satellite. Both Brazil and Japan are members of the Global Precipitation Measurement project.

===Artemis program===
On 21 October 2020, Brazil was invited by the United States to join NASA&#x27;s Artemis Space Program. On 15 June 2021, the country officially joined the program by signing the Artemis Accords with the U.S. and international partners, for the joint exploration of the Moon from 2024 and Mars and beyond in 2030s. The roles of Brazil include the development of a national lunar robot for the use in the future missions.

===BRICS satellite constellation===
On 18 August 2021, AEB signed cooperation agreements with space agencies of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), to the joint-development of a remote sensing satellite constellation, aiming to help with common challenges for the mankind such as the climate change, major disasters and environmental protection. Ground stations located in Cuiabá in Brazil, Moscow Region in Russia, Shadnagar–Hyderabad in India, Sanya in China and Hartebeesthoek in South Africa will receive data from the satellite constellation.

<doc id="304255" wikidata="Q124706" url="?curid=304255" title="The Progressive">
<text>The Progressive is a left-leaning American magazine and website covering politics and culture. Founded in 1909 by U.S. senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. and co-edited with his wife Belle Case La Follette, it was originally called La Follette&#x27;s Weekly and then La Follette&#x27;s. In 1929, it was recapitalized and had its name changed to &quot;The Progressive.&quot; For a period, &quot;The Progressive&quot; was co-owned by La Follette family and William Evjue&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Capital Times&quot;. Its headquarters are in Madison, Wisconsin.

The publication covers civil rights and civil liberties-related topics, immigrant issues, environmentalism, criminal justice reform, and democratic reform. Its current acting and managing editor is David Boddiger. Previous editors included La Follette Sr., Belle Case La Follette, their son Robert Jr., William Evjue, Morris Rubin, Erwin Knoll, Matthew Rothschild, Bill Lueders and Ruth Conniff.

== History ==
===&quot;La Follette&#x27;s Weekly&quot;===
On the first page of its first issue, La Follette wrote this introduction to the magazine:
In the course of every attempt to establish or develop free government, a struggle between Special Privilege and Equal Rights is inevitable. Our great industrial organizations [are] in control of politics, government, and natural resources. They manage conventions, make platforms, [and] dictate legislation. They rule through the very men elected to represent them. The battle is just on. It is young yet. It will be the longest and hardest [battle] ever fought for Democracy. In other lands, the people have lost. Here we shall win. It is a glorious privilege to live in this time, and have a free hand in this fight for government by the people.

Some of the campaigns &quot;La Follette&#x27;s Weekly&quot; engaged in were non-intervention in World War I, opposition to the Palmer Raids in the early 1920s, and calling for action against unemployment during the Depression. La Follette&#x27;s wife, Belle, edited the publication&#x27;s women&#x27;s section, and also wrote articles for the publication condemning racial segregation. An early associate editor was the writer Herbert Quick.

===&quot;The Progressive&quot;===
During the 1940s, &quot;The Progressive&quot; adopted an anti-Stalinist view of the Soviet Union.

During the early 1940s, the magazine argued that the United States should stay out of World War II. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;The Progressive&quot; declared its support for the American war effort. However, &quot;The Progressive&quot; also condemned the dropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima, in contrast to both &quot;The Nation&quot; and &quot;The New Republic&quot;&#x27;s support for the bombing. &quot;The Progressive&quot; reprinted an essay from &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; by Richard Lee Strout, arguing that by using the bombs, &quot;The United States has incurred a terrible responsibility to history which now, unfortunately, can never be withdrawn&quot;.

In 1947, &quot;The Progressive&quot;&#x27;s editors announced they were suspending publication. However, after readers raised $40,000 to save the magazine, &quot;The Progressive&quot; returned as a monthly magazine issued as a non-profit venture.

In the 1950s, &quot;The Progressive&quot; criticized McCarthyism, although the magazine agreed that the U.S. government had the right to blacklist members of the Communist Party. &quot;The Progressive&quot; issued a special issue criticizing McCarthy, &quot;McCarthy: A Documented Record&quot; in 1954; sections from the issue were read aloud in the U.S. Senate, and it became the magazine&#x27;s best-selling issue. &quot;The Progressive&quot; also criticized U.S. nuclear policy and clandestine CIA activity in this period.

In the 1960s, the magazine published five articles by Martin Luther King Jr. and James Baldwin&#x27;s open letter, &quot;My Dungeon Shook - Letter to my Nephew on the One Hundredth Anniversary of Emancipation&quot;, the first section of &quot;The Fire Next Time&quot;. &quot;The Progressive&quot; also denounced U.S. involvement in Indochina.

In 1984, &quot;The Progressive&quot; published &quot;Behind the Death Squads&quot; by Allan Nairn, a critique of U.S. policy in El Salvador.

&quot;The Progressive&quot; opposed the Persian Gulf War, accusing the George H. W. Bush administration of rejecting any options for peaceful negotiation of the crisis. While condemning Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government for its abuse of human rights, it accused the Bush administration of hypocrisy for not taking action against other governments that also abused human rights. The magazine also opposed the second Iraq War.

===&quot;United States v. Progressive, Inc.&quot;===
In 1979, &quot;The Progressive&quot; gained national attention for its article by Howard Morland, &quot;The H-bomb Secret: How we got it and why we&#x27;re telling it&quot;, which the U.S. government suppressed for six months because it contained classified information. The magazine prevailed in a landmark First Amendment case of prior restraint, &quot;United States v. Progressive, Inc.&quot;.

=== 2011 Wisconsin protests ===
Located a few blocks from the Wisconsin State Capitol, &quot;The Progressive&quot; covered the protests that began in February 2011 in response to Governor Scott Walker&#x27;s Wisconsin budget repair bill. &quot;Madison Magazine&quot; named &quot;The Progressive&#x27;s&quot; political editor Ruth Conniff as one of its Editors&#x27; Choice in 2011 for her &quot;frontline dispatches from inside and outside the State Capitol and the courtroom across the street&quot;.

=== 100th anniversary ===
For its 100th year in print, the magazine published a book featuring &quot;some of the best writing in &quot;The Progressive&quot; from 1909 to 2009&quot; titled &quot;Democracy in Print&quot;, published by the University of Wisconsin Press.

=== Circulation ===
With a fall to 27,000 subscribers in 1999, in April 2004, following the Iraq War, &quot;The Progressive&quot;&#x27;s circulation reached a record 65,000. By 2010, circulation had settled near 47,000.

&quot;The Progressive&quot; solicits gifts, grants, and sponsorships, publicizing donors who give a total of $5,000 or more per calendar year, according to its website.

== Notable contributors ==
Throughout the years, &quot;The Progressive&quot; has published articles by Jane Addams, James Baldwin, Louis Brandeis, Noam Chomsky, Clarence Darrow, John Kenneth Galbraith, Charles V. Hamilton, Nat Hentoff, Seymour Hersh, Molly Ivins, June Jordan, Helen Keller, Martin Luther King Jr., Sidney Lens, Jack London, Milton Mayer, A.J. Muste, George Orwell, Marcus Raskin, Bertrand Russell, Edward Said, Carl Sandburg, Upton Sinclair, Lincoln Steffens, I.F. Stone, Norman Thomas, George Wald, James Wechsler and Howard Zinn.

It has also published liberal politicians such as Russ Feingold, J. William Fulbright, Dennis Kucinich, George McGovern, Bernie Sanders, Adlai Stevenson, and Paul Wellstone.

<text>The national flag of the United Kingdom is the Union Jack, also known as the &quot;Union Flag&quot;.

The design of the Union Jack dates back to the Act of Union 1801, which united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland (previously in personal union) to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The flag consists of the red cross of Saint George (patron saint of England, which also represents Wales), edged in white, superimposed on the saltire of Saint Patrick (patron saint of Ireland), also edged in white, which are superimposed on the saltire of Saint Andrew (patron saint of Scotland). Wales is not represented in the Union Flag by Wales&#x27;s patron saint, Saint David, because the flag was designed whilst Wales was part of the Kingdom of England.

The flag proportions on land and the war flag used by the British Army have the proportions 3:5. The flag&#x27;s height-to-length proportions at sea are 1:2. The Union Flag also features in the canton of the flags of the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force, and the British Merchant Navy. These flags are known as ensigns.

The earlier flag of Great Britain was established in 1606 by a proclamation of King James VI and I of Scotland and England. The new flag of the United Kingdom was officially created by an Order in Council of 1801, with its blazon reading as follows:
No official standardised colours were specified, although the Flag Institute defines the red and royal blue colours as Pantone 186 C (RGB 207, 20, 43) and Pantone 280 C (RGB 0, 36, 125), respectively.

== Name ==
According to the Flag Institute: &quot;It is often stated that the Union Flag should only be described as the Union Jack when flown in the bows of a warship, but this is a relatively recent idea. From early in its life, the Admiralty itself frequently referred to the flag as the Union Jack, whatever its use&quot; In 1902, an Admiralty Circular announced that Their Lordships had decided that either name could be used officially. Such use was given Parliamentary approval in 1908 when it was stated that &quot;the Union Jack should be regarded as the National flag&quot;. Notwithstanding Their Lordships&#x27; circular of 1902, by 1913, the Admiralty described the &quot;Union Flag&quot; and added in a footnote that &#x27;A Jack is a Flag to be flown only on the &quot;Jack&quot; Staff&#x27;.

The etymology of &quot;Jack&quot; in the context of flagstaffs reaches back to Middle German. The suffix &quot;-kin&quot; was used in Middle Dutch and Middle German as a diminutive. Examples occur in both Chaucer and Langland though the form is unknown in Old English. &quot;John&quot; is a common male forename (going back to the Bible), appearing in Dutch as &quot;Jan&quot;. Both languages use it as a generic form for a man in general. The two were combined in the Middle Dutch &quot;Janke&quot;, whence Middle French &quot;Jakke&quot; and Middle English &quot;Jack&quot;. Jack came to be used to identify all manner of particularly small objects or small versions of larger ones. The &quot;OED&quot; has definition 21 &quot;Something insignificant, or smaller than the normal size&quot; and gives examples from 1530 to 2014 of this usage. Further examples in the compounds section at 2b illustrate this. The original maritime flag use of &quot;jack&quot; was &quot;A ship&#x27;s flag of a smaller size than the ensign, used at sea as a signal, or as an identifying device&quot;. The Jack was flown in the bows or from the head of the spritsail mast to indicate the vessel&#x27;s nationality: &quot;You are alsoe for this present service to keepe in yor Jack at yor Boultspritt end and yor Pendant and yor Ordinance&quot; The Union Flag when instantiated as a small jack became known as the &quot;Union Jack&quot; and this later term transferred to more general usage of the Union Flag. Also later a short flagpole was placed in the bows of a ship to fly the jack, this became known as the &quot;jackstaff&quot;.

==Flying the flag==
The Union Flag can be flown by any individual or organisation in Great Britain on any day of their choice. Legal regulations restrict the use of the Union Flag on government buildings in Northern Ireland. Long-standing restrictions on UK government use of the flag elsewhere were abolished in July 2007.

===Upside-down===
While the flag appears symmetric, the white lines above and below the diagonal red are different widths. On the side closer to the flagpole (or on the left when depicted on paper), the white lines above the diagonals are wider; on the side farther from the flagpole (or on the right when depicted on paper), the converse is true. Thus, no change will be apparent when rotating the flag 180 degrees, but if mirrored the flag will be upside-down.

Placing the flag upside down is considered lèse majesté and is offensive to some. However, it can be flown upside down as a distress signal. While this is rare, it was used by groups under siege during the Boer War and during campaigns in India in the late 18th century. 

===St Patrick&#x27;s saltire===
Because of the relative positions of the saltires of St Patrick and St Andrew, the UK flag is not symmetrical. The red saltire of St Patrick is offset such that it does not relegate the white saltire of St Andrew to a mere border. St Andrew&#x27;s saltire has the higher position at the hoist side with St Patrick&#x27;s saltire in the higher position on the opposite side.

===Half-mast===
The Union Flag is flown from UK government buildings at half-mast in the following situations:
*from the announcement of the death of the Sovereign (an exception is made for Proclamation Day – the day the new Sovereign is proclaimed, when the Flag is flown at full mast from 11 am to sunset)
*the day of the funeral of a member of the British royal family
*the funeral of a foreign Head of State
*the funeral of a former British Prime Minister

The Sovereign sometimes declares other days when the Union Flag is to fly at half-mast. Half-mast means the flag is flown two-thirds of the way up the flagpole with at least the height of the flag between the top of the flag and the top of the flagpole.

== Flying from public buildings ==
Until July 2007, the Union Flag was only flown on UK government buildings on a limited number of special days each year. The choice of days was managed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). Government buildings are those used by civil servants, the Crown, or the armed forces. They were not applicable to private citizens, corporations, or local authorities.

On 3 July 2007, the Justice Secretary Jack Straw laid a green paper before Parliament entitled &quot;The Governance of Britain&quot;. Alongside a range of proposed changes to the constitutional arrangements of the UK was a specific announcement that there would be consultation on whether the rules on flag-flying on UK government buildings should be relaxed.

Two days later, Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that with immediate effect the Union Flag would fly from the flagpole above the front entrance of 10 Downing Street on every day of the year. The intention was to increase feelings of British national identity. Other UK government departments were asked to follow this lead, and all government buildings in Whitehall did so.

James Purnell, Culture Secretary from June 2007 to January 2008 in Brown&#x27;s administration, subsequently concurred with the abolition of the restrictions – pending consultation on longer term arrangements.

===Flag days===
The flag days directed by the DCMS include birthdays of members of the Royal Family, the wedding anniversary of the Monarch, Commonwealth Day, Accession Day, Coronation Day, The King&#x27;s Official Birthday, Remembrance Sunday and (in the Greater London area) on the days of the State Opening and prorogation of Parliament.

Since 2024, the relevant days have been:

* Second Monday in March (Commonwealth Day)
* 9 April (anniversary of the wedding of The King and The Queen)
* 6 May (anniversary of the coronation of The King and The Queen)
* Second Saturday in June (official birthday of The King)
* 21 June (birthday of The Prince of Wales)
* 17 July (birthday of The Queen)
* 8 September (anniversary of the accession of The King)
* Second Sunday in November (Remembrance Sunday)
* 14 November (actual birthday of The King)

In addition, the flag should be flown in the following areas on the specified days:
* Wales, 1 March: Saint David&#x27;s Day
* Northern Ireland, 17 March: Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day
* England, 23 April: Saint George&#x27;s Day
* Scotland, 30 November: Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day
* Greater London: the opening and proroguing of Parliament

Some non-central government bodies still continue to follow the flag days.

In Scotland, the Scottish Government has decreed that the Flag of Scotland (&quot;the Saltire&quot;) will fly on all its buildings every day from 8 am until sunset, but there is no specific policy on flying the Union Flag and as such it is sometimes flown alongside the Saltire and sometimes omitted. An exception is made for &quot;national days&quot;. On these days, the Saltire shall be lowered and replaced with the Union Flag. These are the same as the flag days noted above with the exception of:
* 3 September: Merchant Navy Day
On Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day, the Union Flag can only be flown if the building has more than one flagpole—the Saltire will not be lowered to make way for the Union Flag if there is only one flagpole.

== Welsh representation ==
In November 2007 the then culture minister Margaret Hodge said she would consider a redesign of the Union Flag to incorporate the Welsh dragon, during a debate in the House of Commons on the frequency with which the flag flies above public buildings. The issue was initially raised by Ian Lucas, another Labour MP, who complained that the flag introduced in 1606 following the accession of James VI of Scotland to the English throne as James I assumed the Welsh population as English under the bracket of England and Wales (represented by the cross of St George) which he then combined with the saltire of St Andrew which represented the union of England and Scotland. This principle continued in 1801 when the St Patrick cross was incorporated following the Union with Ireland Act 1800. Lucas claimed the identity of Wales had been suppressed ever since the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542. In the debate, Albert Owen MP said that &quot;we in Wales do not feel part of the union flag because the dragon or the cross of St David is not on it.&quot; Conservative MP Stewart Jackson described the comments as &quot;eccentric&quot;.

==Northern Ireland==
In Northern Ireland, the Union Flag is flown from buildings of the Northern Ireland Office as decreed by Regulations published in 2000. The Regulations were amended in 2002 to remove the requirement to fly the flag on the birthdays of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon who both died that year. The current flag days are now the same as the United Kingdom government days noted above with the exception of the Queen Camilla&#x27;s birthday, which was only added to the UK flag days after her wedding to King Charles in 2005, and has not yet been extended to Northern Ireland.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland is the only body in the United Kingdom that is not permitted to fly the Union Flag and is only permitted to fly its service flag or the Royal Standard in the event of a visit by the Sovereign.

== Scottish independence ==
As of 2013, numerous proposals were made about how the Union Flag might be altered to create a flag for the union of England, Wales and Northern Ireland after possible Scottish independence. The College of Arms stated that there would be no need to change the flag in those circumstances, and the existing flag could continue to be used if desired. Regarding the removal of Scottish heraldic features from the Union Flag, the Court of the Lord Lyon stated in 2012 that &quot;[that] would be speculation at this stage, and we could only cross that bridge if we came to it.&quot;

<text>Dreuxilla Divine Carter (born Nelson Roldán; January 12, 1974) is a Puerto Rican drag queen character on television. Divine has gained major popularity as a drag performer both in Puerto Rico and eastern United States cities such as New York and Miami. She is also a comedian, a pageant host and a fashion critic.

Divine has been featured in various television related articles and covers of several show-biz magazines, such as: &quot;Vea&quot;, &quot;Teve Guía&quot;, &quot;Colony Magazine&quot;, and in a centerfold of daily newspaper &quot;Primera Hora&quot;.

Dreuxilla was the host of a daily television variety show, opposite Puerto Rican journalist Milly Cangiano, titled: &quot;Sacando Chispas&quot; (Extracting Sparks), created by Puerto Rican television producer Luisito Vigoreaux and broadcast by Televicentro in Puerto Rico and cable network WAPA America located in Springfield, Massachusetts throughout the United States. It was broadcast live in the afternoon, and repeated on tape, late night. It has been acknowledged by television audiences nationwide and internationally. As of December 31, 2008, Dreuxilla was unemployed. However, Divine is known to often make appearances in TV shows and interviews, as well as being the occasional host of parties, awards, and the like.

From July 12–15, 2007, Dreuxilla was one of the star MC&#x27;s of the yearly event &quot;Las Fiestas de la Bahía&quot;, (The Bay Parties) in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico.

The identity of the male comedian that embodies Dreuxilla Divine was, for a very long time, a very well kept secret. As of 2013, she was co-hosting the popular television show Pegate al Medio Dia.

In June 2022, Dreuxilla was honored by Orgullo Boquerón for &quot;her extensive career in the media&quot;.

In 2023, Dreuxilla started a new show called &quot;Bohemia para las Madres&quot;.

<doc id="304263" wikidata="Q3355478" url="?curid=304263" title="Medical prescription">
<text>A prescription, often abbreviated  or Rx, is a formal communication from physicians or other registered healthcare professionals to a pharmacist, authorizing them to a specific prescription drug for a specific patient. Historically, it was a physician&#x27;s instruction to an apothecary listing the materials to be compounded into a treatmentthe symbol (a capital letter R, crossed to indicate abbreviation) comes from the first word of a medieval prescription, Latin (), that gave the list of the materials to be compounded.

==Format and definition ==

For a communication to be accepted as a legal medical prescription, it needs to be filed by a qualified dentist, advanced practice nurse, physician, or veterinarian, for whom the medication prescribed is within their scope of practice to prescribe. This is regardless of whether the prescription includes prescription drugs, controlled substances, or over-the-counter treatments.

Prescriptions may be entered into an electronic medical record system and transmitted electronically to a pharmacy. Alternatively, a prescription may be handwritten on preprinted prescription forms that have been assembled into pads, or printed onto similar forms using a computer printer or even on plain paper, according to the circumstances. In some cases, a prescription may be transmitted orally by telephone from the physician to the pharmacist. The content of a prescription includes the name and address of the prescribing provider and any other legal requirements, such as a registration number (e.g., a DEA number in the United States). Unique to each prescription is the name of the patient. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the patient&#x27;s name and address must also be recorded. Each prescription is dated, and some jurisdictions may place a time limit on the prescription. In the past, prescriptions contained instructions for the pharmacist to use for compounding the pharmaceutical product, but most prescriptions now specify pharmaceutical products that were manufactured and require little or no preparation by the pharmacist. Prescriptions also contain directions for the patient to follow when taking the drug. These directions are printed on the label of the pharmaceutical product.

The word &#x27;, from &#x27; (&#x27;before&#x27;) and &quot;script&quot; (&#x27;writing, written&#x27;), refers to the fact that the prescription is an order that must be written down before a drug can be dispensed. Those within the industry will often call prescriptions simply &quot;scripts&quot;.

==Contents==
Every prescription contains who prescribed the prescription, who the prescription is valid for, and what is prescribed. Some jurisdictions, drug types or patient groups require additional information as explained below.

===Drug equivalence and non-substitution===
Many brand name drugs have cheaper generic drug substitutes that are therapeutically and biochemically equivalent. Prescriptions will also contain instructions on whether the prescriber will allow the pharmacist to substitute a generic version of the drug. This instruction is communicated in a number of ways. In some jurisdictions, the preprinted prescription contains two signature lines: one line has &quot;dispense as written&quot; printed underneath; the other line has &quot;substitution permitted&quot; underneath. Some have a preprinted box &quot;dispense as written&quot; for the prescriber to check off (but this is easily checked off by anyone with access to the prescription). In other jurisdictions, the protocol is for the prescriber to handwrite one of the following phrases: &quot;dispense as written&quot;, &quot;DAW&quot;, &quot;brand necessary&quot;, &quot;do not substitute&quot;, &quot;no substitution&quot;, &quot;medically necessary&quot;, &quot;do not interchange&quot;. In Britain&#x27;s National Health Service, doctors are reminded that money spent on branded rather than generic drugs is consequently not available for more deserving cases.

===Prescriptions for children===
In some jurisdictions, it may be a legal requirement to include the age of child on the prescription. For pediatric prescriptions some advise the inclusion of the age of the child if the patient is less than twelve and the age and months if less than five. (In general, including the age on the prescription is helpful.) Adding the weight of the child is also helpful.

===Label and instructions===
Prescriptions in the US often have a &quot;label&quot; box. When checked, the pharmacist is instructed to label the medication and provide information about the prescription itself is given in addition to instructions on taking the medication. Otherwise, the patient is simply given the instructions. Some prescribers further inform the patient and pharmacist by providing the indication for the medication; i.e. what is being treated. This assists the pharmacist in checking for errors as many common medications can be used for multiple medical conditions. Some prescriptions will specify whether and how many &quot;repeats&quot; or &quot;refills&quot; are allowed; that is whether the patient may obtain more of the same medication without getting a new prescription from the medical practitioner. Regulations may restrict some types of drugs from being refilled.

==Writing prescriptions==
===Legal capacity to write prescriptions===
National or local (e.g. US state or Canadian provincial) legislation governs who can write a prescription. In the United States, physicians (either M.D., D.O. or D.P.M.) have the broadest prescriptive authority. All 50 US states and the District of Columbia allow licensed certified Physician Assistants (PAs) prescription authority (with some states, limitations exist to controlled substances). All 50 US states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam allow registered certified nurse practitioners and other advanced practice registered nurses (such as certified nurse-midwives) prescription power (with some states including limitations to controlled substances). Many other healthcare professions also have prescriptive authority related to their area of practice. Veterinarians and dentists have prescribing power in all 50 US states and the District of Columbia. Clinical pharmacists are allowed to prescribe in some US states through the use of a drug formulary or collaboration agreements. Florida pharmacists can write prescriptions for a limited set of drugs. In all US states, optometrists prescribe medications to treat certain eye diseases, and also issue spectacle and contact lens prescriptions for corrective eyewear. Several US states have passed RxP legislation, allowing clinical psychologists who are registered as medical psychologists and have also undergone specialized training in script-writing, to prescribe drugs to treat emotional and mental disorders.

In August 2013, legislative changes in the UK allowed physiotherapists and podiatrists to have independent prescribing rights for licensed medicines that are used to treat conditions within their own area of expertise and competence. In 2018 this was extended to paramedics.
===Standing orders===
Some jurisdictions allow certain physicians (sometimes a government official like the state Secretary of Health, sometimes physicians in local clinics or pharmacies) to write &quot;standing orders&quot; that act like a prescription for everyone in the general public. These orders also provide a standard procedure for determining if administration is necessary and details of how it is to be performed safely. These are typically used to authorize certain people to perform preventive, low-risk, or emergency care that would be otherwise logistically cumbersome to authorize for individual patients, including vaccinations, prevention of cavities, birth control, treatment of infectious diseases, and reversal of drug overdoses.

===Legibility of handwritten prescriptions===
Doctors&#x27; handwriting is a reference to the stereotypically illegible handwriting of some medical practitioners, which sometimes causes errors in dispensing. In the US, illegible handwriting has been indirectly responsible for at least 7,000 deaths annually.

Some jurisdictions have legislatively required prescriptions to be legible—Florida specifies &quot;legibly printed or typed&quot;—and the Institute for Safe Medication Practices advocated the elimination of handwritten prescriptions altogether. There have been numerous devices designed to electronically read the handwriting of doctors, including electronic character recognition, keyword spotters, and &quot;postprocessing approaches&quot;, though the gradual shift to electronic health records and electronic prescriptions may alleviate the need for handwritten prescriptions altogether. In Britain&#x27;s NHS, remaining paper prescriptions are almost invariably computer printed, and electronic (rather than paper) communication between surgery and pharmacy is increasingly the norm.

===Conventions for avoiding ambiguity===
Over the years, prescribers have developed many conventions for prescription-writing, with the goal of avoiding ambiguities or misinterpretation.
These include:
*Careful use of decimal points to avoid ambiguity:
**Avoiding unnecessary decimal points and trailing zeros, e.g. 5 mL rather than 5.0 mL, 0.5 rather than .50 or 0.50, to avoid possible misinterpretation as 50.
**Always using leading zeros on decimal numbers less than 1: e.g. 0.5 rather than .5 to avoid misinterpretation as 5.
*Directions written out in full in English (although some common Latin abbreviations are listed below).
*Quantities given directly or implied by the frequency and duration of the directions.
*Where the directions are &quot;as needed&quot;, the quantity should always be specified.
*Where possible, usage directions should specify times (7 am, 3 pm, 11 pm) rather than simply frequency (three times a day) and especially relationship to meals for orally consumed medication.
*The use of permanent ink is encouraged. 
*Avoiding units such as &quot;teaspoons&quot; or &quot;tablespoons&quot;.
*Writing out numbers as words &quot;and&quot; numerals (&quot;dispense #30 (thirty)&quot;) as in a bank draft or cheque.
*The use of the apothecaries&#x27; system or avoirdupois units and symbols of measure – pints (O), ounces (℥), drams (ℨ), scruples (℈), grains (gr), and minims (♏︎) – is discouraged given the potential for confusion. For example, the abbreviation for a grain (&quot;gr&quot;) can be confused with the gram, abbreviated g, and the symbol for minims (♏︎), which looks almost identical to an &#x27;m&#x27;, can be confused with micrograms or metres. Also, the symbols for ounce (℥) and dram (ℨ) can easily be confused with the numeral &#x27;3&#x27; and the Latin letter ezh, &#x27;Ʒ&#x27; and the symbol for pint (O) can be easily read as a &#x27;0&#x27;. Given the potential for errors, metric equivalents should always be used.
*The degree symbol (°), which is commonly used as an abbreviation for hours (e.g., &quot;q 2-4°&quot; for every 2–4 hours), should not be used, since it can be confused with a &#x27;0&#x27; (zero). Further, the use of the degree symbol for primary, secondary, and tertiary (1°, 2°, and 3°) is discouraged, since the former could be confused with quantities (i.e. 10, 20 and 30, respectively).
* Micrograms are abbreviated &quot;mcg&quot; rather than &quot;μg&quot; (which, if handwritten, could easily be mistaken for &quot;mg&quot; (milligrams). Even so, pharmacists must be on the alert for inadvertent over- or under-prescribing through a momentary lapse of concentration.

===Abbreviations===
Many abbreviations are derived from Latin phrases. Hospital pharmacies have more abbreviations, some specific to the hospital. Different jurisdictions follow different conventions on what is abbreviated or not. Prescriptions that do not follow area conventions may be flagged as possible forgeries.

Some abbreviations that are ambiguous, or that in their written form might be confused with something else, are not recommended and should be avoided. These are flagged in the table in the main article. However, all abbreviations carry an increased risk for confusion and misinterpretation and should be used cautiously.

==Non-prescription drug prescriptions==
Over-the-counter medications and non-controlled medical supplies such as dressings, which do not require a prescription, may also be prescribed. Depending upon a jurisdiction&#x27;s medical system, non-prescription drugs may be prescribed because drug benefit plans may reimburse the patient only if the over-the-counter medication is taken at the direction of a qualified medical practitioner. In the countries of the UK, National Health Service (NHS) prescriptions are either free or have a fixed price per item; a prescription may be issued so the patient does not have to purchase the item at commercial price.

Some medical software requires a prescription.

Legislation may define certain equipment as &quot;prescription devices&quot;. Such prescription devices can only be used under the supervision of authorized personnel and such authorization is typically documented using a prescription. Examples of prescription devices include dental cement (for affixing braces to tooth surfaces), various prostheses, gut sutures, sickle cell tests, cervical cap and ultrasound monitor.

In some jurisdictions, hypodermic syringes are in a special class of their own, regulated as illicit drug use accessories separate from regular medical legislation. Such legislation often allows syringes to be dispensed only with a prescription.

==History==
The idea of prescriptions dates back to the beginning of history. So long as there were medications and a writing system to capture directions for preparation and usage, there were prescriptions. The oldest known medical prescription text was found at Ebla, in modern Syria, and dates back to around 2500 BCE.

Modern prescriptions are actually &quot;extemporaneous prescriptions&quot; (from the Latin , &#x27;at/from the time&#x27;), meaning that the prescription is written on the spot for a specific patient with a specific ailment. This is distinguished from a non-extemporaneous prescription that is a generic recipe for a general ailment. Modern prescriptions evolved with the separation of the role of the pharmacists from that of the physician. Today the term &quot;extemporaneous prescriptions&quot; is reserved for &quot;compound prescriptions&quot; that requires the pharmacist to mix or &quot;compound&quot; the medication in the pharmacy for the specific needs of the patient.

Predating modern legal definitions of a prescription, a prescription traditionally is composed of four parts: a &quot;superscription&quot;, &quot;inscription&quot;, &quot;subscription&quot;, and &quot;signature&quot;.

The &quot;superscription&quot; section contains the date of the prescription and patient information (name, address, age, etc.). The symbol &quot; separates the superscription from the inscriptions sections. In this arrangement of the prescription, the &quot; is a symbol for &quot;recipe&quot; or literally the imperative &quot;take!&quot; This is an exhortation to the pharmacist by the medical practitioner, &quot;I want the patient to have the following medication&quot; – in other words, &quot;take the following components and compound this medication for the patient&quot;.

The &quot;inscription&quot; section defines what is the medication. The inscription section is further composed of one or more of:
* a &quot;basis&quot; or chief ingredient intended to cure (&quot;curare&quot;)
* an &quot;adjuvant&quot; to assist its action and make it cure quickly (&quot;cito&quot;)
* a &quot;corrective&quot; to prevent or lessen any undesirable effect (&quot;tuto&quot;)
* a &quot;vehicle&quot; or &quot;excipient&quot; to make it suitable for administration and pleasant to the patient (&quot;jucunde&quot;)

The &quot;subscription&quot; section contains dispensing directions to the pharmacist. This may be compounding instructions or quantities.

The &quot;signature&quot; section contains directions to the patient and is often abbreviated &quot;Sig.&quot; or &quot;Signa.&quot; It also obviously contains the signature of the prescribing medical practitioner though the word &quot;signature&quot; has two distinct meanings here and the abbreviations are sometimes used to avoid confusion.

Thus sample prescriptions in modern textbooks are often presented as:
 Rx: medication
 Disp.: dispensing instructions
 Sig.: patient instructions

==Use of technology==

As a prescription is nothing more than information among a prescriber, pharmacist and patient, information technology can be applied to it. Existing information technology is adequate to print out prescriptions. Hospital information systems in some hospitals do away with prescriptions within the hospital. There are proposals to securely transmit the prescription from the prescriber to the pharmacist using smartcard or the internet. In the UK a project called the Electronic Transfer of Prescriptions (ETP) within the National Programme for IT (NPfIT) is currently piloting such a scheme between prescribers and pharmacies.

Within computerized pharmacies, the information on paper prescriptions is recorded into a database. Afterwards, the paper prescription is archived for storage and legal reasons.

A pharmacy chain is often linked together through corporate headquarters with computer networking. A person who has a prescription filled at one branch can get a refill of that prescription at any other store in the chain, as well as have their information available for new prescriptions at any branch.

Some online pharmacies also offer services to customers over the internet, allowing users to specify the store that they will pick up the medicine from.

Many pharmacies now offer services to ship prescription refills right to the patient&#x27;s home. They also offer mail service where you can mail in a new, original prescription and a signed document, and they will ship the filled prescription back to you.

Pharmacy information systems are a potential source of valuable information for pharmaceutical companies as it contains information about the prescriber&#x27;s prescribing habits. Prescription data mining of such data is a developing, specialized field.

Many prescribers lack the digitized information systems that reduce prescribing errors. To reduce these errors, some investigators have developed modified prescription forms that prompt the prescriber to provide all the desired elements of a good prescription. The modified forms also contain predefined choices such as common quantities, units and frequencies that the prescriber may circle rather than write out. Such forms are thought to reduce errors, especially omission and handwriting errors and are actively under evaluation.

<text>Calderdale is a metropolitan borough of West Yorkshire, England, which had a population of 211,439. It takes its name from the River Calder, and dale, a word for valley. The name Calderdale usually refers to the borough through which the upper river flows, while the actual landform is known as the Calder Valley. Several small valleys contain tributaries of the River Calder. The main towns of the borough are Brighouse, Elland, Halifax, Hebden Bridge, Sowerby Bridge and Todmorden.

Calderdale covers part of the South Pennines, and the Calder Valley is the southernmost of the Yorkshire Dales, though it is not part of the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The borough was formed in 1974 by the merger of nine local government districts.

Halifax is the commercial, cultural and administrative centre of the borough. Calderdale is served by Calderdale Council, which is headquartered in Halifax, with some functions based in Todmorden.

==History==
The Roman settlement of Cambodunum was probably located within Calderdale. A Roman fort has been excavated in Slack, which is in the neighbouring borough of Kirklees, but its identity is not yet certain.

The metropolitan district of Calderdale was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered the area of eight former districts and part of a ninth, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Municipal Borough of Brighouse
*Elland Urban District
*County Borough of Halifax
*Hebden Royd Urban District
*Hepton Rural District
*Queensbury and Shelf Urban District (Shelf part only, Queensbury went to Bradford)
*Ripponden Urban District
*Sowerby Bridge Urban District
*Municipal Borough of Todmorden

In 2022, Yorkshire Water built an emergency water pipeline from Calderdale to Ponden Reservoir in Haworth as Yorkshire experienced its driest period on record.

==Governance==


The borough is divided into 17 wards and each is represented on Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council by three councillors. Each councillor is normally elected on a first past the post basis for a four-year period which is staggered with the other councillors of that ward so that only one councillor per ward is up for election at any one time. Exceptions to this include by-elections and ward boundary changes.

==Demography==
The largest ethnic group within Calderdale at the 2011 census was White British at 86.7%, down from 90.8% in 2001. The next largest ethnic group are Pakistanis, comprising 6.8% of the population (4.9% in 2001).

In 2011, Christians comprised 60.6% of the borough&#x27;s population. This was followed by those of no religion (30.2%) and Muslims (7.8%).

The 2021 census showed further changes in the borough, with the White British population declining slightly to 82.7% and the proportion of residents of Pakistani heritage increasing to 8.5%. Younger residents showed a higher level of ethnic diversity with 74.7% of Calderdale&#x27;s population aged under 16 identifying as White British compared with 93.5% of the population over 65. Those holding no religion had risen to 42.0% of the population, now comprising a slightly higher proportion of residents than Christians (41.5%) and the Muslim population remaining relatively stable increasing to 9.5%. The large majority of Calderdale residents were born in England - falling slightly from 90.6% to 89.7% between 2011 and 2021.

== Public services and facilities ==
===Health===
Calderdale is part of the Calderdale Primary Care Trust, South West Yorkshire NHS Foundation Trust and Calderdale &amp; Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust. The borough has two hospitals and one hospice. The main hospital (part of Calderdale &amp; Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust) is the Calderdale Royal Hospital, located on the main route to Huddersfield in Salterhebble. It has specialist departments: Calderdale&#x27;s A&amp;E department and the Calderdale Birth Centre. The hospital was built and opened in 2001 on the site of the original Halifax General Hospital. After the new hospital opened, the Royal Halifax Infirmary closed and all services were transferred, as were services from Northowram Hospital. NHS Ambulance services are provided by the Yorkshire Ambulance Service from stations in Halifax, Brighouse and Todmorden. Overgate Hospice provides specialist palliative care for adults in Calderdale. Elland Hospital, Calderdale&#x27;s only private hospital, is located by the Calderdale Way. Formerly BUPA Elland Independent Hospital, it is now owned and operated by Classic Hospitals.

===Police===
Calderdale is served by West Yorkshire Police; whose Calderdale Division headquarters is at Halifax police station. Other police stations are located in Todmorden and at Brighouse, which reopened in 2009.

===Fire and rescue===

Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council was granted a coat of arms in 1977. The Paschal lamb is the emblem of John the Baptist, the patron saint of wool workers. It was shown on the former arms of Halifax. The green and blue wavy line of the shield symbolises the River Calder and Calder Valley. The white rose is for Yorkshire. The crest shows a rose bush with nine white flowers representing the nine former authorities that now comprise the Calderdale district. The bush is shown growing out of a mural crown, a common feature in municipal arms. The lion supporters are taken from the arms of Halifax and also for England. A lion also featured on the shield of the arms of Brighouse. The black crescents, also from the arms of Brighouse, are featured on the arms of the Brighouse family. The blue wave around each lion&#x27;s collar is from the arms of Todmorden and represents the Calder again. The motto, , is Latin for &#x27;Industry, skill, and foresight&#x27;.

<text>The French Second Republic ( or ), officially the French Republic (), was the second republican government of France. It existed from 1848 until its dissolution in 1852. 

Following the final defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo, France had been reconstituted into a monarchy known as the Bourbon Restoration. After a brief period of revolutionary turmoil in 1830, royal power was again secured in the &quot;July Monarchy&quot;, governed under principles of moderate conservatism and improved relations with the United Kingdom. 

In 1848, Europe erupted into a mass revolutionary wave in which many citizens challenged their royal leaders. Much of it was led by France in the February Revolution, overthrowing King Louis-Philippe. Radical and liberal factions of the population convened the French Second Republic in 1848. Attempting to restore the First French Republic&#x27;s values on human rights and constitutional government, they adopted the motto of the First Republic; . The republic was plagued with tribalist tendencies of its leading factions: royalists, proto-socialists, liberals, and conservatives. In this environment, Napoleon&#x27;s nephew, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, established himself as a popular anti-establishment figure and was elected president in 1848.

Under the Second Republic&#x27;s constitution, the president was restricted to a single term. Louis-Napoléon overthrew the republic in an 1851 self-coup d&#x27;état, proclaimed himself Emperor Napoleon III, and created the Second French Empire.

== Revolution of 1848 ==
France&#x27;s &quot;February Revolution&quot; of 1848, was the first of the Revolutions of 1848. The events of the revolution led to the end of the 1830–1848 Orleans Monarchy and led to the creation of the Second Republic.

The Revolution of 1830, part of a wave of similar regime changes across Europe, had put an end to the monarchy of the Bourbon Restoration and installed a more liberal constitutional monarchy under the Orleans dynasty governed predominantly by Guizot&#x27;s conservative-liberal center-right and Thiers&#x27; progressive-liberal center-left.

But to the left of the dynastic parties, the monarchy was criticized by Republicans (a mixture of Radicals and socialists) for being insufficiently democratic: its electoral system was based on a narrow, privileged electorate of property owners and therefore excluded workers. During the 1840s several petitions requesting electoral reform (universal manhood suffrage) had been issued by the National Guard but had been rejected by both of the main dynastic parties. Political meetings dedicated to this issue were banned by the government, and electoral reformers&#x27; therefore bypassed the ban by holding a series of &#x27;banquets&#x27; (1847–1848), events where the political debate was disguised as dinner speeches. This movement began overseen by Odilon Barrot&#x27;s moderate center-left liberal critics of Guizot&#x27;s conservative government but took on a life of its own after 1846 when the economic crisis encouraged ordinary workers to demand a say over the government.

On 14 February 1848, Guizot&#x27;s government decided to put an end to the banquets, on the grounds of constituting illegal political assembly. On 22 February, striking workers and Republican students took to the streets, demanding an end to Guizot&#x27;s government, and erected barricades. Odilon Barrot called a motion of no confidence in Guizot, hoping that this might satisfy the rioters, but the Chamber of Deputies sided with the premier. The government called a state of emergency, thinking it could rely on the troops of the National Guard, but instead on the morning of 23 February, the Guardsmen sided with the revolutionaries, protecting them from the regular soldiers who by now had been called in.

The industrial population of the faubourgs was welcomed by the National Guard on their way toward the center of Paris. Barricades were raised after the shooting of protestors outside the Guizot manor by soldiers.

On 23 February 1848 Premier François Guizot&#x27;s cabinet resigned, abandoned by the petite bourgeoisie, on whose support they thought they could depend. The heads of the more left-leaning conservative-liberal monarchist parties, Louis-Mathieu Molé and Adolphe Thiers, declined to form a government. Odilon Barrot accepted, and Thomas Robert Bugeaud, commander-in-chief of the first military division, who had begun to attack the barricades, was recalled. In the face of the insurrection that had now taken possession of the whole capital, King Louis-Philippe abdicated in favor of his nine-year-old grandson, Prince Philippe, Count of Paris, but under pressure from insurgents who invaded the chamber of the Chamber of Deputies, leaders leaned in favor of the insurrection and prepared a provisional government; a (second) republic was then proclaimed by Alphonse de Lamartine.

The provisional government, with Dupont de l&#x27;Eure as its president, consisted of Lamartine for foreign affairs, Crémieux for justice, Ledru-Rollin for the interior, Carnot for public instruction, Goudchaux for finance, Arago for the navy, and Burdeau for war. Garnier-Pagès was mayor of Paris.

But, in 1830, the republican-socialist party set up a rival government at the Hôtel de Ville (city hall), including Louis Blanc, Armand Marrast, Ferdinand Flocon, and Alexandre Martin, known as Albert L&#x27;Ouvrier (&quot;Albert the Worker&quot;), which bid fair to involve discord and civil war. But this time the Palais Bourbon was not victorious over the Hôtel de Ville. It had to consent to a fusion of the two bodies, in which, however, the predominating elements were the moderate Republicans. It was uncertain what the policy of the new government would be.

One party seeing that despite the changes in the last sixty years of all political institutions, the position of the people had not been improved, demanded a reform of society itself, the abolition of the privileged position of property, which they viewed as the only obstacle to equality, and as an emblem hoisted the red flag (the 1791 red flag was, however, the symbol not merely of the French Revolution, but rather of martial law and of order). The other party wished to maintain society on the basis of its traditional institutions, and rallied around the tricolore. As a concession made by Lamartine to popular aspirations, and in exchange for the maintaining of the tricolor flag, he conceded the Republican triptych of &quot;Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité&quot;, written on the flag, on which a red rosette was also to be added.

The first collision took place as to the form which the 1848 Revolution was to take. Lamartine wished for them to maintain their original principles, with the whole country as supreme, whereas the revolutionaries under Ledru-Rollin wished for the Republic of Paris to hold a monopoly on political power. On 5 March the government, under the pressure of the Parisian clubs, decided in favor of an immediate reference to the people, and direct universal suffrage, and adjourned it until 26 April. This added the uneducated masses to the electorate and led to the election of the Constituent Assembly on 4 May 1848. The provisional government having resigned, the republican and anti-socialist majority on 9 May entrusted the supreme power to an Executive Commission consisting of five members: Arago, Pierre Marie de Saint-Georges, Garnier-Pagès, Lamartine, and Ledru-Rollin.

The result of the general election, the return of a predominantly moderate, if not monarchical, constituent assembly dashed the hopes of those who had looked for the establishment, by a peaceful revolution, of their ideal socialist state. but they were not prepared to yield without a struggle, and in Paris itself they commanded a formidable force. In spite of the preponderance of the &quot;tricolor&quot; party in the provisional government, so long as the voice of France had not spoken, the socialists, supported by the Parisian proletariat, had exercised an influence on policy disproportionate to their relative numbers. By the decree of 24 February, the provisional government had solemnly accepted the principle of the &quot;right to work&quot;, and decided to establish &quot;National Workshops&quot; for the unemployed; at the same time, a sort of industrial parliament was established at the Luxembourg Palace, under the presidency of Louis Blanc, with the object of preparing a scheme for the organization of labor; and, lastly, by the decree of 8 March, the property qualification for enrolment in the National Guard had been abolished and the workmen were supplied with arms. The socialists thus formed a sort of state-within-a-state, complete with a government and an armed force.

==1848 uprisings==

On 15 May, an armed mob, headed by Raspail, Blanqui and Barbès, and assisted by the proletariat-aligned Guard, attempted to overwhelm the Assembly, but were defeated by the bourgeois-aligned battalions of the National Guard. Meanwhile, the national workshops were unable to provide remunerative work for the genuine unemployed, and of the thousands who applied, the greater number were employed in aimless digging and refilling of trenches; soon even this expedient failed, and those for whom work could not be invented were given a half wage of 1 franc a day.

On 21 June, Alfred de Falloux decided in the name of the parliamentary commission on labour that the workmen should be discharged within three days and those who were able-bodied should be forced to enlist in the armed forces.

After this, the June Days Uprising broke out, over the course of 24–26 June, when the eastern industrial quarter of Paris, led by Pujol, fought the western quarter, led by Louis-Eugène Cavaignac, who had been appointed dictator. The socialist party was defeated and afterwards its members were deported. But the republic had been discredited and had already become unpopular with both the peasants, who were exasperated by the new land tax of 45 centimes imposed in order to fill the empty treasury, and with the bourgeoisie, who were intimidated by the power of the revolutionary clubs and disadvantaged by the economic stagnation. By the &quot;riots&quot; of the June Days, the working classes were also alienated from it. The Duke of Wellington wrote at this time, &quot;France needs a Napoleon! I cannot yet see him...&quot; The granting of universal suffrage to a society with Imperialist sympathies would benefit reactionaries, which culminated in the election of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte as president of the republic.

==Constitution==

The new constitution, proclaiming a democratic republic, direct universal suffrage, and the separation of powers, was promulgated on 4 November 1848. Under the new constitution, there was to be a single permanent Assembly of 750 members elected for a term of three years by the scrutin de liste. The Assembly would elect members of a Council of State to serve for six years. Laws would be proposed by the Council of State, to be voted on by the Assembly. The executive power was delegated to the president, who was elected for four years by direct universal suffrage, i.e. on a broader basis than that of the Assembly, and was not eligible for re-election. He was to choose his ministers, who, like him, would be responsible to the Assembly. Finally, a revision of the constitution was made practically impossible; it involved obtaining three times in succession a majority of three-quarters of the deputies in a special assembly. It was in vain that Jules Grévy, in the name of those who perceived the obvious and inevitable risk of creating, under the name of a president, a monarch and more than a king, proposed that the head of the state should be no more than a removable president of the ministerial council. Lamartine, thinking that he was sure to be the choice of the electors under universal suffrage, won over the support of the Chamber, which did not even take the precaution of rendering ineligible the members of families which had reigned over France. It made the presidency an office dependent upon popular acclamation.

==Presidential election of 1848==

The election was keenly contested; the democratic republicans adopted as their candidate Ledru-Rollin, the &quot;pure republicans&quot; Cavaignac, and the recently reorganized Imperialist party Prince Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte. Unknown in 1835, and forgotten or despised since 1840, Louis Napoleon had in the last eight years advanced sufficiently in the public estimation to be elected to the Constituent Assembly in 1848 by five departments. He owed this rapid increase of popularity partly to blunders of the government of July, which had unwisely aroused the memory of the country, filled as it was with recollections of the Empire, and partly to Louis Napoléon&#x27;s campaign carried on from his prison at Ham by means of pamphlets of socialistic tendencies. Moreover, the monarchists, led by Thiers and the committee of the Rue de Poitiers, were no longer content even with the safe dictatorship of the upright Cavaignac, and joined forces with the Bonapartists. On 10 December the peasants gave over 5,000,000 votes to a name: Napoléon, which stood for order at all costs, against 1,400,000 for Cavaignac. Henri Georges Boulay de la Meurthe was elected vice president, a unique position in French history.

==Presidency of Louis Napoléon==

For three years, there was an indecisive struggle between the heterogeneous Assembly and the president, who was silently awaiting his opportunity. He chose as his ministers men with little inclination towards republicanism, with a preference for Orléanists, the chief of whom was Odilon Barrot. In order to strengthen his position, he endeavoured to conciliate the reactionary parties, without committing himself to any of them. The chief instance of this was the expedition to Rome voted by the Catholics, to restore the temporal authority of Pope Pius IX, who had fled Rome in fear of the nationalists and republicans. (Garibaldi and Mazzini had been elected to a Constitutional Assembly.) The pope called for international intervention to restore him in his temporal power. The French president moved to establish the power and prestige of France against that of Austria, as beginning the work of European renovation and reconstruction which he already looked upon as his mission. French troops under Oudinot marched into Rome. This provoked an insurrection in Paris in favour of the Roman Republic, that of the Château d&#x27;Eau, which was crushed on 13 June 1849. On the other hand, when the pope, though only just restored, began to yield to the general movement of reaction, the president demanded that he should set up a Liberal government. The pope&#x27;s dilatory reply having been accepted by the French ministry, the president replaced it on 1 November, by the Fould-Rocher cabinet.

This looked like a declaration of war against the Catholic and monarchist majority in the Legislative Assembly, which had been elected on 28 May in a moment of panic. But the president again pretended to be playing the game of the Orléanists, as he had done in the case of the Constituent Assembly. The complementary elections of March and April 1850 resulted in an unexpected victory for the republicans which alarmed the conservative leaders, Thiers, Berryer and Montalembert. The president and the Assembly co-operated in the passage of the &quot;Loi Falloux&quot; of 15 March 1850, which again placed university instruction under the direction of the Church.

A conservative electoral law was passed on 31 May. It required each voter to prove three years&#x27; residence at his current address by way of entries in the record of direct taxes. This effectively repealed universal suffrage: factory workers, who moved fairly often, were thus disenfranchised. The law of 16 July aggravated the severity of the press restrictions by re-establishing the &quot;caution money&quot; (&quot;cautionnement&quot;) deposited by proprietors and editors of papers with the government as a guarantee of good behaviour. Finally, an interpretation of the law on clubs and political societies suppressed about this time all the republican societies.

== Coup d&#x27;état and end of the Second Republic ==

The president had only joined the cry of &quot;Down with the Republicans!&quot; in Montalembert in the hope of effecting a revision of the constitution without having recourse to a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. His concessions only increased the boldness of the monarchists, who had only accepted Louis-Napoléon as president in opposition to the Republic and as a step in the direction of the monarchy. A conflict was now inevitable between his personal policy and the majority of the Chamber, who were divided into legitimists and Orléanists in spite of the death of Louis-Philippe in August 1850.

Louis-Napoléon exploited their projects for a restoration of the monarchy, which he knew to be unpopular in the country, and which gave him the opportunity of furthering his own personal ambitions. From 8 August to 12 November 1850 he went about France stating the case for a revision of the constitution in speeches which he varied according to each place; he held reviews, at which cries of &quot;Vive Napoléon!&quot; showed that the army was with him; he superseded General Changarnier, on whose arms the parliament relied for the projected monarchical &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;; he replaced his Orléanist ministry with obscure men devoted to his own cause, such as Morny, Fleury and Persigny, and gathered round him officers of the African army, broken men like General Saint-Arnaud; in fact he practically declared open war.

His reply to the votes of censure passed by the Assembly, and their refusal to increase his civil list was to hint at a vast communistic plot in order to scare the bourgeoisie, and to denounce the electoral law of 31 May 1850, in order to gain the support of the mass of the people. The Assembly retaliated by throwing out the proposal for a partial reform of that article of the constitution which prohibited the re-election of the president and the re-establishment of universal suffrage (July). All hope of a peaceful issue was at an end. When the questors called upon the Chamber to have posted in all barracks the decree of 6 May 1848 concerning the right of the Assembly to demand the support of the troops if attacked, the Mountain, dreading a restoration of the monarchy, voted with the Bonapartists against the measure, thus disarming the legislative power.

Louis-Napoléon saw his opportunity, and organised the French coup of 1851. On the night of 1/2 December 1851, the anniversary of his uncle Napoleon&#x27;s coronation in 1804 and his victory at Austerlitz in 1805, he dissolved the Chamber, re-established universal suffrage, had all the party leaders arrested, and summoned a new assembly to prolong his term of office for ten years. The deputies who had met under Berryer at the Mairie of the 10th arrondissement to defend the constitution and proclaim the deposition of Louis Napoleon were scattered by the troops at Mazas and Mont Valérien. The resistance organized by the republicans within Paris under Victor Hugo was soon subdued by the intoxicated soldiers. The more serious resistance in the &quot;départements&quot; was crushed by declaring a state of siege and by the &quot;mixed commissions&quot;. The plebiscite of 20 December ratified by a huge majority the coup d&#x27;état in favour of the prince-president, who alone reaped the benefit of the excesses of the Republicans and the reactionary passions of the monarchists.

<text>The least sandpiper (Calidris minutilla) is the smallest shorebird. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-colored waterside birds. The specific &quot;minutilla&quot; is Medieval Latin for &quot;very small&quot;.

==Description==

This species has yellow-green legs and a short, thin, dark bill. Breeding adults are brown with dark brown streaks on top and white underneath. They have a light line above the eye and a dark crown. In winter, Least sandpipers are grey above. The juveniles are brightly patterned above with rufous coloration and white mantle stripes.

This bird can be difficult to distinguish from other similar tiny shorebirds; these are known collectively as &quot;peeps&quot; or &quot;stints&quot;. In particular, least sandpiper is very similar to its Asian counterpart, long-toed stint. It differs from that species in its more compact, shorter-necked appearance, shorter toes, somewhat duller colors, and stronger wingbar.

Measurements:

* Length: 5.1-5.9 in (13-15 cm)
* Weight: 0.7-1.1 oz (19-30 g)
* Wingspan: 10.6-11.0 in (27-28 cm)

==Breeding and migration==
Their breeding habitat is the northern North American continent on tundra or in bogs. They nest on the ground near water. The female lays four eggs in a shallow scrape lined with grass and moss. Both parents incubate; the female leaves before the young birds fledge and sometimes before the eggs hatch. The young birds feed themselves and are able to fly within two weeks of birth.

They migrate in flocks to the southern United States, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. They occur as very rare vagrants in western Europe.

==Feeding==
These birds forage on mudflats, picking up food by sight, sometimes by probing. They mainly eat small crustaceans, insects, and snails.

<text>The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) was a United Kingdom government department formed on 19 October 1970. It was replaced with the creation of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills on 28 June 2007.

==History==
The department was formed on 19 October 1970 through the merger of the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Technology, creating a new cabinet post of Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Additionally, the department also took over the Department of Employment&#x27;s former responsibilities for monopolies and mergers. However, in January 1974, the department&#x27;s responsibilities for energy production were transferred to a newly created Department of Energy. On 5 March that year, following a Labour Party victory in the February 1974 general election, the department was split into the Department of Trade, the Department of Industry and the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection.

===Reformation===
In 1983 the departments of Trade and Industry were reunited. The Department of Energy was re-merged back into the DTI in 1992, but various media-related functions transferred to the Department of National Heritage. Until it was succeeded in June 2007 the DTI continued to set the energy policy of the United Kingdom.

After the 2005 general election the DTI was renamed to the Department for Productivity, Energy and Industry, but the name reverted to Department of Trade and Industry less than a week later, after widespread derision, including some from the Confederation of British Industry.

=== Later splits and mergers ===

In 2007, part of DTI merged into the new Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS), while most of it was renamed as the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR); part of that would become the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) in 2008. The responsibilities which had gone to DIUS largely returned in 2009 with a remerger to create the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), though in 2016 the Department for International Trade (DIT) was split off. Energy returned in 2017 with the creation of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS); BEIS lasted until 2023 when this department was again split and mixed with other responsibilities, into the Department for Business and Trade (DBT), the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) and the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT).

==Structure==
The DTI had a wide range of responsibilities. There were ultimately nine main areas covered by the DTI:
* Company Law
* Trade
* Business Growth
* Innovation
* Employment Law
* Regional Economic Development
* Energy
* Science
* Consumer Law.

===Emergent technology===
From 1999 to 2005 it led the national E-Commerce Awards with InterForum, a not for profit membership organisation that helped British businesses to trade electronically. This aimed to encourage Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises to develop their business through the use of E-Commerce technologies.

===Corporate policing===
It also had responsibility for investigating misconduct by company directors, in which role Private Eye repeatedly lampooned it as &quot;the Department of Timidity and Inaction&quot;.

== Programs ==

=== Small firms&#x27; Merit Award for Research and Technology ===

The Small firms&#x27; Merit Award for Research and Technology (SMART) was a discretionary business grant scheme run by the UK Department of Trade and Industry for a number of years in the 1980s and 1990s. The award was made to companies winning an annual competition (organised regionally) based on a judgement of the technical and market viability of research or technology development proposals; in essence the award represented seed-corn funding for innovative developments that had some market potential.

The scheme was generally considered to be very successful. In 2002 the scheme was changed from a competition to an award to any applicant who met minimum criteria. This led to several regions exhausting their budget. In 2005 the scheme was shut down and replaced with the Grant for Research and Development which was again a regional competition.

<doc id="304286" wikidata="Q1662431" url="?curid=304286" title="Info-ZIP">
<text>Info-ZIP is a set of open-source software to handle ZIP archives. It has been in circulation since 1989. It consists of 4 separately-installable packages: the Zip and UnZip command-line utilities; and WiZ and MacZip, which are graphical user interfaces for archiving programs in Microsoft Windows and classic Mac OS, respectively.

Info-ZIP&#x27;s Zip and UnZip have been ported to dozens of computing platforms. The UnZip web page describes UnZip as &quot;The Third Most Portable Program in the World&quot;, surpassed by Hello World, C-Kermit, and possibly the Linux kernel. The &quot;zip&quot; and &quot;unzip&quot; programs included with most Linux and Unix distributions are Info-ZIP&#x27;s Zip and UnZip.

In addition to the Info-ZIP releases themselves, parts of Info-ZIP, including zlib, have been used in numerous other file archivers and other programs. Many Info-ZIP programmers have also been involved in other projects closely related to the DEFLATE compression algorithm, such as the PNG image format and the zlib software library.

==Features==
The UnZip package also includes three additional utilities:
* fUnZip extracts a file in a ZIP or gzip file directly to output from archives or other piped input.
* UnZipSFX is software to make a ZIP file into an executable self-extracting archive.
* ZipInfo outputs, in a variety of formats, information about ZIP files and their contents.

The Zip package includes three additional utilities:
* ZipCloak adds or removes password encryption from file in a ZIP archive.
* ZipNote allows the modification of comment fields in ZIP archives.
* ZipSplit splits a ZIP archive into sections for separate disks or downloads.

==History==
===UnZip===
UnZip 1.0 (March 1989) was released by Samuel M. Smith. It was written in Pascal and C. Pascal was abandoned soon after.

UnZip 2.0 (September 1989) was released by Samuel M. Smith. It included support for the &quot;unimploding&quot; (method 6) introduced by PKZIP 1.01. George Sipe created Unix version.

UnZip 2.0a (December 1989) was released by Carl Mascott and John Cowan.

In Spring 1990, Info-ZIP was formed as a mailing list on SIMTEL20, and released

UnZip 3.0 (May 1990) became the first public release by Info-ZIP group.

UnZip 4.0 (December 1990) adds support of &quot;central directory&quot; within .ZIP archive.

UnZip 5.0 (August 1992) introduces support of DEFLATE (method 8) compression method, used in PKZIP 1.93a. Method 8 has become the de facto base standard for ZIP archives.

In 1994 and 1995 Info-ZIP turned a corner, and effectively became the &quot;de facto&quot; ZIP program on non-MS-DOS systems. A huge number of ports were released that year, including numerous minicomputers, mainframes and practically every microcomputer ever developed.

UnZip 5.41 (April 2000) was relicensed under Info-ZIP License.

UnZip 5.50 (February 2002) adds support of Deflate64 (method 9) decompression.

UnZip 6.0 adds support of &quot;Zip64&quot; .ZIP archive and bzip2 (method 12) decompression. Support for bzip2-style compression was also in Zip from 3.0f beta.

===Zip===
Zip 1.9 (August 1992) introduces support of DEFLATE (method 8) compression method. Method 8 has become the de facto base standard for ZIP archives.

Zip 2.0 (September 1993) has many portability improvements.

Zip 2.1 (May 1996) added new &quot;UNIX&quot; time info to preserve file times across timezones and OSes.

Zip 2.3 (December 1999) was the first Info-ZIP archiver tool under the new BSD-like Info-ZIP License.

Zip 3.0 (2008-07-07) supports &quot;Zip64&quot; .ZIP archive, more than 65536 files per archive, multi-part archive, bzip2 compression, Unicode (UTF-8) filename and (partial) comment, Unix 32-bit UIDs/GIDs

===WiZ===
WiZ 4.0 (November 1997) was released by Info-ZIP.

WiZ 5.01 (April 2000) was relicensed under Info-ZIP License.

===MacZip===
MacZip 1.05 (July 2000) was released under Info-ZIP License.

MacZip 1.06 was released in February 2001. It was written by Dirk Hasse.

== Forks and patches ==
As a slowly-updated open software package, many patches have been written by various Linux distributions to improve info-zip tools. In addition, from 2015 to 2019, 14 unzip vulnerabilities have been published on the CVE list without version or website updates from info-zip. (Three CVEs from 2014 in oCERT-2014-011 are left out of most statistics; info-zip did provide patches on their now-defunct forum.)

Mark Adler has a set of patches for unzip 6.0 that detects zip bombs of the overlapping type. This issue has a CVE ID of CVE-2019-13232.

The Debian project provides various patches to correct typographical errors and security issues, including the 17 unzip CVEs. It also hardens against format string injection and other obvious security issues.

To deal with pre-UTF-8 Zip files created on other code pages, Giovanni Scafora created a patch that hooks unzip up with iconv for encoding conversion. A version of the patch combined with CVE mitigations are provided as a User Package in Arch Linux. The Gentoo project improves upon the hard-coded locales with an external library. Similar approach for Ubuntu is being discussed.

The Fedora project (an upstream of Red Hat Enterprise Linux) applies Adler&#x27;s patch, most of the Debian patches (or similar), as well as extra security patches like a stack non-execution patch to their unzip. The zip patches are similar to Debian patches.

=== Official betas ===
Some official improvements to zip and unzip are stuck in beta-stage as zip 3.1c and unzip 6.10b from 2015. Among other things, both added support for PPMd8 and LZMA compressions in files, support for AES encryption, and included iconv-based Unicode improvements (based on unzip-iconv). A newer release candidate, Zip 3.1d, appeared on the official FTP site in 2015, but the SourceForge page was not updated. Partially due to the added compressors, the zipped file size increased from 1.4 MB (3.1c) to 2.9 MB (3.1d).

The antinode.info FTP site seems to be hosting an even more cutting-edge source of info-zip utilities. Individual revisions are organized into folders containing files differing from the previous revision, and zip archives for sources are occasionally released. , the site provides Unzip 6.10c (rev. 25, 21 Dec 2018) and a loose-file development version of Zip 3.1e (rev. 21, 14 Dec 2021). The owner of the site, Steven Schweda, maintains these versions. Schweda is a member of the original info-zip team.

=== Replacements ===
FreeBSD has opted to replace info-zip utilities. It produces a command-line compatible version of based on libarchive, which also supports zipx and AES.

<text>The president of the Board of Trade is head of the Board of Trade. A committee of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, it was first established as a temporary committee of inquiry in the 17th century that evolved gradually into a government department with diverse functions. The current holder of the post is Jonathan Reynolds, who is concurrently the secretary of state for business and trade.

== History ==

The idea of a Board of Trade was first translated into action by Oliver Cromwell in 1655 when he appointed his son Richard Cromwell to head a body of Lords of the Privy Council, judges and merchants to consider measures to promote trade. Charles II established a Council of Trade on 7 November 1660, followed by a Council of Foreign Plantations on 1 December that year. The two were united on 16 September 1672 as the Board of Trade and Plantations.

After the Board was re-established in 1696, there were 15 (and later 16) members of the Boardthe 7 (later 8) great officers of state, and eight unofficial members, who did the majority of the work. The senior unofficial board member was the board president, commonly known as the first lord of trade. The board was abolished on 11 July 1782, but a Committee of the Privy Council was established on 5 March 1784 for the same purposes. On 23 August 1786, a new committee was set up, more strongly focused on commercial functions than the previous boards of trade. At first, the president of the Board of Trade only occasionally sat in the Cabinet. Still, from the early 19th century, it was usually a cabinet-level position.

In 2020, there was an unusual appointment of a deputy president to assist the president. Still, the holder remained only an adviser to the Board. This appears to have been a one-off appointment, and this role no longer exists. However, the president was previously assisted by the vice president.

<text>A cabochon (; ) is a gemstone that has been shaped and polished, as opposed to faceted. The resulting form is usually a convex (rounded) obverse with a flat reverse. Cabochon was the default method of preparing gemstones before gemstone cutting developed.

==Application==
Cutting &quot;en cabochon&quot; (French: &quot;in the manner of a cabochon&quot;) is usually applied to opaque gems, while faceting is usually used for transparent stones. Hardness is also taken into account as softer gemstones with a hardness lower than 7 on the Mohs hardness scale are easily scratched, mainly by silicon dioxide in dust and grit. This would quickly make translucent gems unattractive—instead they are polished as cabochons, making the scratches less evident.

In asteriated stones such as star sapphires and chatoyant stones such as cat&#x27;s eye chrysoberyl, a domed cabochon cut can show the star or eye, which would not be visible in a faceted cut.

The usual shape for cutting cabochons is an ellipse, because the eye is less sensitive to small asymmetries in an ellipse, as opposed to in a uniformly round shape, such as a circle, and because the elliptical shape, combined with the dome, is attractive. An exception is cabochons on some watches&#x27; crowns, which are circular.

The procedure involves cutting a slab of the rough rock with a slab saw, and then stencilling a shape from a template. The slab is then trimmed near the marked line using a diamond blade saw—called a trim saw. Diamond-impregnated wheels or silicon carbide wheels can be used to grind the rough rock down. Most lapidary workshops and production facilities have moved away from silicon carbide to diamond grinding wheels or flat lap disks.

Once the piece is trimmed it can be &quot;dopped&quot; or completed by hand. &quot;Dopping&quot; is normally done by adhering the stone with hard wax onto a length of wooden dowel called a &quot;dop stick&quot;. The piece is then ground to the template line, the back edges may be bevelled, and finally the top is sanded and polished to a uniform dome.

<text>A rhapsody in music is a one-movement work that is episodic yet integrated, free-flowing in structure, featuring a range of highly contrasted moods, colour, and tonality. An air of spontaneous inspiration and a sense of improvisation make it freer in form than a set of variations.

The word &quot;rhapsody&quot; is derived from the , &quot;rhapsōidos&quot;, a reciter of epic poetry (a rhapsodist), and came to be used in Europe by the 16th century as a designation for literary forms, not only epic poems, but also for collections of miscellaneous writings and, later, any extravagant expression of sentiment or feeling. In the 18th century, literary rhapsodies first became linked with music, as in Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart&#x27;s &quot;Musicalische Rhapsodien&quot; (1786), a collection of songs with keyboard accompaniment, together with a few solo keyboard pieces. The first solo piano compositions with the title, however, were Václav Jan Tomášek’s fifteen Rhapsodies, the first of which appeared in 1810. Although vocal examples may be found as late as Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Alto Rhapsody&quot;, Op. 53 (1869), in the 19th century the rhapsody had become primarily an instrumental form, first for the piano and then, in the second half of the century, a large-scale nationalistic orchestral &quot;epic&quot;—a fashion initiated by Franz Liszt. Interest in Romani violin playing beginning in the mid-19th century led to a number of important pieces in that style, in particular by Liszt, Antonín Dvořák, George Enescu, Ernst von Dohnányi, and Béla Bartók, and in the early 20th century British composers exhibiting the influence of folksong composed a number of examples, including Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27;s three &quot;Norfolk Rhapsodies&quot;, George Butterworth&#x27;s &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;, and Frederick Delius&#x27;s &quot;Brigg Fair&quot; (which is subtitled &quot;An English Rhapsody&quot;).

In modern times, several composers have endeavored to feature non-traditional orchestral instruments within the context of the rhapsody. During the post World War II era, John Serry Sr. showcased the chromatic piano accordion within his &quot;American Rhapsody&quot; (Alpha Music Publishing, 1955). Decades later, Ney Gabriel Rosauro included the Brazilian berimbau as well as the Brazilian repinique within his &quot;Rhapsody for Solo Percussion and Orchestra&quot; (1992) while also incorporating an optional section in which the performers are encouraged to include a favorite exotic or folklordic instrument. 

In 1975, the British rock band Queen released &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, a bombastic mock-operatic rock song which is in the form of a four-part suite, but performed with rock instrumentation. Though described by its composer Freddie Mercury as a &quot;mock opera&quot;, it has also been characterized as a &quot;sort of seven-minute rock cantata (or &#x27;megasong&#x27;) in three distinct movements&quot;. It became one of the UK&#x27;s best-selling singles of all time.
Some familiar examples may give an idea of the character of a rhapsody:

*Hugo Alfvén, &quot;Swedish Rhapsody No. 1&quot; (&quot;Midsommarvaka&quot;), for orchestra
*Béla Bartók, Rhapsody No. 1 and Rhapsody No. 2 for violin and piano (also arranged for orchestra)
*Johannes Brahms, Two Rhapsodies, Op. 79, and Rhapsody in E-flat major, Op. 119, No. 4, for solo piano
*Emmanuel Chabrier, &quot;España, rhapsody for orchestra&quot;
*Claude Debussy, &quot;Première rhapsodie&quot; for clarinet and piano (also orchestrated by the composer)
*Claude Debussy, Rhapsody for alto saxophone and orchestra
*Ernst von Dohnányi, Four Rhapsodies, Op. 11, for solo piano
*George Enescu, &quot;Romanian Rhapsodies&quot; Nos. 1 and 2, for orchestra
*Edward German, &quot;Welsh Rhapsody&quot;, for orchestra
*George Gershwin, &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, &quot;Second Rhapsody&quot;, for piano and orchestra
*James P. Johnson, &quot;Yamekraw—A Negro Rhapsody&quot;
*Herbert Howells, Three Rhapsodies, Op. 17, for solo organ
*Franz Liszt, &quot;Hungarian Rhapsodies&quot; for solo piano
*David Popper, &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody&quot;
*Sergei Rachmaninoff, &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot;, Op. 43, for piano and orchestra
*Maurice Ravel, &quot;Rapsodie espagnole&quot;, for orchestra
*Ralph Vaughan Williams, &quot;Norfolk Rhapsody No. 1&quot;, for orchestra
*Pancho Vladigerov, &quot;Bulgarian Rhapsody &quot;Vardar&quot;&quot;

<text>The Department of Prices and Consumer Protection was a short-lived United Kingdom government department created by the incoming Labour government in 1974 when the functions of the Department of Trade and Industry were divided between three new departments (the Department of Trade, the Department of Industry and the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection). In 1979 the department was abolished by the new Conservative government and its responsibilities were re-integrated into the Department of Trade.

<text>Polygons are used in computer graphics to compose images that are three-dimensional in appearance, and are one of the most popular geometric building blocks in computer graphics. Polygons are built up of vertices, and are typically used as triangles.

A model&#x27;s polygons can be rendered and seen simply in a wire frame model, where the outlines of the polygons are seen, as opposed to having them be shaded. This is the reason for a polygon stage in computer animation. The &quot;polygon count&quot; refers to the number of polygons being rendered per frame.

Beginning with the fifth generation of video game consoles, the use of polygons became more common, and with each succeeding generation, polygonal models became increasingly complex.

==Competing methods for rendering polygons that avoid seams==

**Floating Point
**Fixed-Point
**Polygon
**because of rounding, every scanline has its own direction in space and may show its front or back side to the viewer.
*Fraction (mathematics)
**Bresenham&#x27;s line algorithm
**Polygons have to be split into triangles
**The whole triangle shows the same side to the viewer
**The point numbers from the Transform and lighting stage have to converted to Fraction (mathematics)

<text>Sigmund Esco &quot;Jackie&quot; Jackson (born May 4, 1951) is an American singer and songwriter best known as a founding member of the Jackson 5, for which he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. Jackson is the second child of the Jackson family, and the oldest Jackson brother.

==Early life==
Sigmund Esco Jackson was born at St. Mary&#x27;s Mercy Hospital in Gary, Indiana, on his mother Katherine&#x27;s (May 4, 1930) 21st birthday in 1951. He was given the nickname Jackie by his grandfather, Samuel Jackson. He and his siblings (Michael, Marlon, Tito, Jermaine, Randy, Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) were brought up in a two-bedroom house in Gary, Indiana, an industrial steel city south of Chicago. His father, Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Jackson (July 26, 1928 – June 27, 2018), worked at a steel mill, and at night he played in an R&amp;B band called the Falcons with his brother, Luther. Their mother, Katherine, a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, played the clarinet and piano. His father formed the Jackson Brothers singing group, which included Jackie and his brothers Tito and Jermaine. Younger brothers Marlon and Michael played assorted percussive instruments.

By 1964, Joe made Michael the lead singer forming the Jackson 5, after Katherine discovered that Michael could sing. The brothers rehearsed every day after school under Joe&#x27;s lead, keeping themselves busy and out of trouble. Joe saw that their talent could get them out of Gary. Jackie gives his mother credit saying &quot;there wouldn&#x27;t have been The Jackson 5 without her&quot;. Katherine used to sing harmonies with the brothers. Within two years, the group emerged professionally, signing with Motown in 1968. Before the group signed with Motown, Jackie wanted to pursue a career in professional baseball.

==Career==

===The Jackson 5===

Jackie performed with a high tenor singing voice. He had the highest and lightest natural speaking and singing voice of all the brothers. He added brief lead parts in some of the Jackson 5&#x27;s hit singles, including &quot;I Want You Back&quot; and &quot;ABC&quot;. When the Jackson 5 became the Jacksons after leaving Motown for CBS Records in 1976, Jackson&#x27;s role as a vocalist and songwriter increased. He added a lead vocal alongside Michael on their Top 10 Epic single &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot;, and also added composition on six of the group&#x27;s albums with Epic. Jackson&#x27;s voice changed to a lower tenor vocal style during the Epic years. One of his most successful compositions, &quot;Can You Feel It&quot;, co-written with Michael, became an international hit in 1981. Jackson began performing more lead vocals as Michael pursued a solo career. On their 1984 album &quot;Victory&quot;, Jackie performed lead on the song &quot;Wait&quot; and wrote the single &quot;Torture&quot;. Before the start of the Victory Tour in 1984, he suffered a knee injury during rehearsals. Jackie recovered well enough to perform on the last leg of shows in December 1984 in Los Angeles, where Michael announced he was leaving the group. In early 1985, Marlon left the group as well. Jackie, Tito and Randy became session musicians, vocalists and producers during this time.

In 1987, Jackie, Randy, Tito and Jermaine reunited and recorded &quot;Time Out for the Burglar&quot;, the theme song for the film &quot;Burglar&quot;. The single was a minor R&amp;B hit in the US, but had more success in Belgium where it peaked in the Top 40 at #17 for two consecutive weeks. The Jacksons also contributed backing vocals to the Tito-produced title track of Tramaine Hawkins&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Freedom&quot;. In late 1988, the Jacksons set out to record their final album, &quot;2300 Jackson Street&quot;, on which Jackie and Jermaine split leads on the songs. &quot;2300 Jackson Street&quot; failed to chart, despite the Randy and Jermaine-led hit &quot;Nothin&#x27; (That Compares 2 U)&quot;. Randy did not participate in much of the album&#x27;s promotion as he was working on his solo project, leaving Jackie, Tito and Jermaine to promote the album mostly overseas. Afterward, each brother went into solo projects. In 2001, after years out of the limelight, Jackie and his brothers gave a reunion performance with Michael during his 30th-anniversary special at Madison Square Garden

=== Solo career ===
In 1973, Jackie released his first solo album &quot;Jackie Jackson&quot;. Jackie signed with Polydor, and released his first solo album in 16 years, &quot;Be the One&quot;, in late 1989. The album was a minor hit, charting at #89 on the R&amp;B charts. The first single, &quot;Stay&quot;, was a Top 40 R&amp;B hit while the second single, &quot;Cruzin&#x27;&quot;, was a moderate success.

===Later work===
Later in 2002, residing in Las Vegas, Jackie founded and ran two record companies, Jesco Records and Futurist Entertainment. His son Sigmund, Jr., known as DEALZ, released a mixtape on Jesco in 2007. In 2009, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon starred in the reality series &quot;The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty&quot; which Jackie executive produced. In 2012, the quartet began their first tour since &quot;Victory&quot; in 1984. In 2017, Jackie signed EDM meets Hip-Hop musical duo &quot;Gold Lemonade&quot; consisting of France born DJ/producer Lya Lewis and Caribbean rooted front-man Jvgg Spvrrow to his label Critically Amused, after having met Lya in Las Vegas in 2015. Jackie also signed artist D.B.L., a long time friend of The Jackson family. Jackie mentored D.B.L. as a child performer (then known as Donny B. Lord) , helping to shape his career and introducing him to his brother, Michael Jackson. 

==Personal life==

Jackie has been married three times and has four children. He married his first wife, Enid Arden Spann (1954 - 1997), in November 1974 after a 5-year courtship. They separated in 1984 and Enid filed for divorce, but they reconciled in 1985. In January 1986, Enid filed for divorce for the final time. She received a restraining order against Jackson after alleging that he was physically abusive. Enid died from a brain aneurysm in 1997. They had two children.

In 2001, Jackie married his second wife, Victoria Triggs. They later divorced. Jackson married his third wife, Emily Besselink, in 2012, who gave birth to twin boys.

<text>Sir Thomas Bodley (2 March 1545 – 28 January 1613) was an English diplomat and scholar who founded the Bodleian Library in Oxford.

==Origins==
Thomas Bodley was born on 2 March 1545, in the second-to-last year of the reign of King Henry VIII, in the city of Exeter in Devon. He was one of the seven sons of John Bodley (d. 15 Oct. 1591) of Exeter, a Protestant merchant who chose foreign exile rather than staying in England under the Roman Catholic government of Queen Mary (). He was thereby involved in the publication of Sir Rowland Hill&#x27;s Geneva Bible.

John&#x27;s father, also John Bodley, was a younger son of the gentry family of Bodley of Dunscombe, near Crediton in Devon. Thomas&#x27;s mother was Joan Hone, a daughter and co-heiress of Robert Hone of Ottery St Mary, Devon.
Thomas&#x27;s younger brother was Sir Josias Bodley, knighted in Ireland by the Earl of Devon.

==Childhood and education==
The family, including Thomas&#x27; younger brother Josias Bodley (and the ten-year-old Nicholas Hilliard, who had been attached to the household by his parents, friends of Bodley), sought refuge in the Duchy of Cleves during the reign of Queen Mary (1553 1558). They stayed in the town of Wesel, then in the imperial free city of Frankfurt, before eventually settling in Geneva, home of Calvinism and a great centre of the Reformation. There, Thomas had the opportunity to study at John Calvin&#x27;s newly erected Academy. He attended lectures in Divinity given by Theodore Beza and Calvin himself and attended services led by John Knox. He learned Greek from Mattheus Beroaldus and Hebrew from Antoine Chevallier. The study of these languages remained enduring passions for Bodley throughout his life.

After Mary&#x27;s death in 1558 and the accession of Queen Elizabeth, the family returned to England, and Bodley entered Magdalen College, Oxford, to study under Lawrence Humphrey. In 1563 he took his B.A. degree, and was shortly thereafter, in 1564, admitted as a Fellow of Merton College.

Thomas Bodley was married to Ann Ball, a wealthy widow, and he left no children.

==Career==
He began lecturing at Merton and in April 1565 was formally appointed as the college&#x27;s first Lecturer in Ancient Greek, a post that was subsequently made permanent. He served in many college offices: in 1569 he was elected as one of the University&#x27;s junior proctors and for some time after was deputy Public Orator. Leaving Oxford in 1576 with a license to study abroad and a grant from his college of ten marks (£6. 13s. 4d.), Bodley toured France, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire, visiting scholars and adding French, Italian, and Spanish to his repertoire of languages.

It has been suggested that during his tour in Italy he was in initiated in Forlì in some form of Pythagorean initiation in a platonic academy.

On his return to England Bodley was appointed a gentleman-usher to Queen Elizabeth, and in 1584 he entered the House of Commons as one of the members for Portsmouth. In 1585 he was entrusted with a mission to form a league between Frederick II of Denmark and certain German princes to assist Henry of Navarre, the future Henry IV of France. He was next dispatched on a secret mission to France. In 1586 he was elected to represent St Germans in parliament, and in 1588 he was sent to The Hague as minister, a post which demanded great diplomatic skill, for it was in the Netherlands that the power of Spain had to be fought. The essential difficulties of his mission were complicated by the intrigues of the queen&#x27;s ministers at home, and Bodley repeatedly asked to be recalled. He was finally permitted to return to England in 1596, but finding his hoped-for promotion to Secretary of State obstructed by the competing interests of Burghley and Essex, he retired from public life and returned to Oxford.

When he married in 1587, he was obliged to resign his fellowship at Merton, but he retained many friends there and in the spring of 1598 the college gave a dinner in his honour. G. H. Martin speculates that the inspiration to restore the old Duke Humfrey&#x27;s Library may have come from the renewal of Bodley&#x27;s contact with Henry Savile and other former colleagues at this dinner. Once his proposal was accepted, he devoted the rest of his life to the library project. The former library had suffered from the overzealous commissioners of Edward VI who weeded the ancient collection. The subject was knighted on 18 April 1604.

==Marriage==

In 1587 he married Ann Carew, the wealthy widow of Mr Ball, and the daughter of Mr Carew of Bristol in Somerset. His monument in Merton College Chapel displays the arms of Bodley impaling Carew (&quot;Or, three lions passant in pale sable&quot;), an ancient Devonshire family seated at Mohuns Ottery, descended from Nicholas Carew (d. 1311), feudal lord of Carew Castle in Pembrokeshire, feudal lord of Odrone (mod. Idrone, County Carlow) in Ireland and lord of the manor of Moulsford in Berkshire.

==Death and burial==
He died on 28 January 1613, and was buried in the choir of Merton College Chapel. His monument survives on the western wall of the north transept of the chapel, formed of black and white marble with pillars representing books and allegories of learning.

==The Bodleian Library==
Bodley&#x27;s greatest achievement was the re-founding of the library at Oxford. In 1444, the existing university library was augmented by a gift of some 300 manuscripts from Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, the youngest son of Henry IV; this prompted the university to build a new library above the Divinity School which was at that time under construction. However, during the Reformation of the 1550s, the library had been stripped and abandoned, remaining virtually untouched until the return of Bodley in 1598. The library was later named the Bodleian Library in his honour. He determined, he said, &quot;to take his farewell of state employments and to set up his staff at the library door in Oxford.&quot; In February of 1598 his offer to restore the old library was accepted by the university. Bodley began his book collection effort in 1600, using the site of the former library above the Divinity School, which was in near ruin.

Although Bodley lived over 400 years ago, modern libraries benefit from some of his ideas and practices.

One important idea that Bodley implemented was the creation of a &quot;Benefactors&#x27; Book&quot; in 1602, which was bound and put on display in the library in 1604. While he did have funding through the wealth of his wife, Ann Ball, and the inheritance he received from his father, Bodley still needed gifts from his affluent friends and colleagues to build his library collection. Although not a completely original idea (as encouragement in 1412 the university chaplain was ordered to say mass for benefactors), Bodley recognized that having the contributor&#x27;s name on permanent display was also inspiring. According to Louis B. Wright, He had prepared a handsome Register of Donations, in vellum, in which the name of every benefactor should be written down in a large and fair hand so all might read. And he kept the Register prominently displayed so that no visitor to the library could escape seeing the generosity of Bodley&#x27;s friends. The plan, as it deserved, was a success, for its originator found that, &#x27;every man bethinks himself how by some good book or other he may be written in the scroll of the benefactors.&#x27;For over four centuries, this innovative idea has continued to motivate friends of libraries everywhere.

Some remarkable donations to the Bodleian Library marked in the register of donations were fifty pounds from Sir Walter Raleigh in 1603, on the eve of his second jailing in the Tower of London, and a copy of Francis Bacon&#x27;s new book &quot;The Advancement of Learning&quot;, presented by the author himself in 1605.

Another significant event related to Bodley was the agreement between the Bodleian Library and the Stationers&#x27; Company, in which &quot;the Company agreed to send to the Library a copy of every book entered in their Register on condition that the books thus given might be borrowed if needed for reprinting, and that the books given to the Library by others might be examined, collated and copied by the Company.&quot;

This made the Bodleian the first legal deposit library. Today it is one of six such libraries in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In 2003, the Copyright Act of 1911 was expanded to include information on CD-ROM and websites. This regulation is in place to ensure the collection and preservation of all published materials as an accurate, up-to-date historical record.

==Publications==
Bodley wrote his autobiography up to the year 1609, which, with the first draft of the statutes drawn up for the library, and his letters to the librarian, Thomas James, was published by Thomas Hearne, under the title of &quot;Reliquiae Bodleianae, or Authentic Remains of Sir Thomas Bodley&quot;, (London, 1703, 8vo).

<doc id="304311" wikidata="Q336222" url="?curid=304311" title="Tito Jackson">
<text>Toriano Adaryll &quot;Tito&quot; Jackson (October 15, 1953 – September 15, 2024) was an American singer and guitarist. He was a founding member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons), a group who rose to fame in the late 1960s and 1970s with the Motown label and had continued success on the Epic label in the late 1970s and 1980s.

Tito and Jackie Jackson were the most consistently present members of the Jacksons, with Jermaine, Marlon, Michael, and Randy leaving at different times. After the end of the &quot;Victory Tour,&quot; Jackson performed session work and as a record producer. In 2001, Jackson reunited with his brothers on Michael Jackson&#x27;s 30th anniversary concert special at Madison Square Garden.

Jackson began a solo career in 2003 performing as a blues musician. He was nominated for a Grammy Award three times, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Jackson 5.

== Early life ==
Tariano Adaryll Jackson was born at St. Mary&#x27;s Mercy Hospital in Gary, Indiana, on October 15, 1953. He was the third of ten children of the Jackson family: Rebbie, Jackie, Jermaine, La Toya, Marlon, Brandon, Michael, Randy, and Janet who lived in a two-bedroom house in Gary. His father, Joseph (July 26, 1928 – June 27, 2018), was a steel mill worker, and played R&amp;B in a band, the Falcons, with his brother Luther. His mother, Katherine (May 4, 1930), is a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. She played the piano and the clarinet. At ten years of age, Tito was caught playing his father&#x27;s guitar after he broke a string. After fixing the string, Joe demanded that he play for him. Once he was finished, Joe bought him his own guitar, and convinced Tito, Jackie, and Jermaine to form a singing group. He was impressed with the vocals of Jackie and Jermaine.

By 1964, Marlon and Michael both joined the group the Jackson 5 after Katherine discovered that they could sing. Katherine is a country-and-western fan, and she sang harmonies with her sons. Before Motown signed them, the brothers spent years rehearsing at home. After school they rehearsed for hours, played a gig, did homework, and went to bed.

== Career ==
=== The Jackson 5 ===
After first performing in school functions and supermarkets, the brothers began participating in local talent shows when Jackson was twelve. By then, his younger brother Michael, then seven, had become the official lead singer of the group. In 1965, they changed their name from the Jackson Brothers to the Jackson Five, and won several talent shows around the Gary area. After winning the Amateur Night competition for the Apollo Theater in August 1967, Joe Jackson began to work part-time at the steel mill to help his sons secure a recording contract. The group signed with Steeltown Records in Gary in November of that year. In January 1968, the Jackson Five&#x27;s first single, &quot;Big Boy&quot;, was released on the Steeltown label.

In 1969, The Jackson 5 signed with Motown Records in Detroit, and scored several hit songs, including their number-one singles &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;, &quot;The Love You Save&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, but despite his talent as a guitar player, Motown refused to allow Jackson to perform guitar on any of the Jackson 5 recording sessions, instead forcing all their guitar parts to be performed by session musicians. As a direct result, his guitar work did not make its debut until he and the Jacksons left Motown for CBS Records in 1976.

He began writing songs with his brothers during this time. Tito and Jackie Jackson were the most consistently present members of the Jacksons, with Jermaine, Marlon, Michael, and Randy leaving at different times. After the end of the &quot;Victory Tour,&quot; Jackson performed session work and as a record producer. After releasing &quot;2300 Jackson Street,&quot; the Jacksons ceased recording work. Jackson was inducted with his brothers into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997.

In 2001, Jackson reunited with his brothers on Michael Jackson&#x27;s 30th anniversary concert special at Madison Square Garden.

=== Solo work and other projects ===

Jackson began a solo career in 2003 performing as a blues musician in various clubs with his band, which included producer and guitarist Angelo Earl, and a management team that included Ed Tate. In 2007, in the United Kingdom, Jackson appeared as a judge on the BBC celebrity singing competition &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot; for series two of the show. He replaced singer Lulu, who was a judge on series one. His co-judges were vocal coach CeCe Sammy, musician Stewart Copeland, and radio DJ Trevor Nelson. In 2009, he was the executive producer of &quot;The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty&quot;, together with his brothers after Michael died.

In 2016, he had his first commercially successful solo single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts with the single, &quot;Get It Baby&quot;, featuring Big Daddy Kane from his album &quot;Tito Time&quot; becoming the ninth and final Jackson family sibling to place a solo single on the charts. The album was released in Japan late in 2016, and in the U.S on iTunes in April 2017. Subsequent to its launch, three singles were released to radio in the United States. The first single, &quot;When the Magic Happens&quot;, featuring Jocelyn Brown, was released on April 1, 2017. Jackson launched the album for the UK market in September 2017.

Jackson performed at the 2019 Living Legends foundation&#x27;s (LLF) Annual Awards Dinner and Gala, performing his single &quot;One Way Street&quot; off his album &quot;Tito Time&quot;. &quot;One Way Street&quot; features a remix from producer Gregg Pagani, who has worked with Charlie Wilson and Johnny Gill.
On July 9, 2021, Jackson released the first single &quot;Love One Another&quot; from his second solo album &quot;Under Your Spell&quot;, released August 6. The single features his brother Marlon Jackson, Kenny Neal, Bobby Rush, and Stevie Wonder. On this album he turned to blues compared to his debut album, &quot;Tito Time&quot;, which explored more pop and R&amp;B sounds. The album &quot;Under Your Spell&quot; also features collaborations with George Benson, rock guitarist Joe Bonamassa, Grady Champion, Claudette King, The O&#x27;Jay&#x27;s Eddie Levert, and Steven Powell.

On September 16, 2022, Jackson took the stage at Ground Zero Blues Club in Biloxi, Mississippi together with Kenny Neal. This was their second show from their &quot;Straight From The Heart Tour&quot;. First show was on August 27 at Winston–Salem Fairgrounds Annex in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.Third show was on September 23, in Bogalusa, Louisiana at the Bogalusa Blues and Heritage Festival.

On March 17, 2023, Jackson teamed up with Brazilian artist Natalia Damini bringing the Motown and the early Jacksons feel back with a new song &quot;Attitude&quot;, and a music video. This collaboration came to be because Jackson&#x27;s long time friend Charve the Don is also Damini&#x27;s manager.

== Personal life and death ==

In June 1972, Jackson married Delores &quot;Dee Dee&quot; Martes at the age of 18, and the couple divorced in 1988. In 1994, Martes was found dead floating in a swimming pool. The death was originally ruled accidental. Later, Los Angeles businessman Donald Bohana was charged with and, in 1998, found guilty of second-degree murder. The couple had three sons—Taj (b. 1973), Taryll (b. 1975), and TJ (b. 1978)—who comprise the R&amp;B/pop group 3T. Jackson had nine grandchildren.

Michael Jackson&#x27;s memorial service was held at the Staples Center on July 7, 2009, in Los Angeles. To honor him, Tito and his brothers Marlon, Jackie, Jermaine, and Randy Jackson served as pallbearers, each wearing a single spangled white glove and sunglasses. On the 12th anniversary of Michael&#x27;s death, Jackson told &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; that he turned to Michael&#x27;s music in remembrance of his brother. In the 2021 interview, Jackson said that because of his brother&#x27;s death, the month of June is difficult to deal with. He also defended his brother from child molestation allegations levied against him.

On September 15, 2024, Jackson suffered a heart attack in Gallup, New Mexico. Jackson was on a road trip with his business partner Terry Harvey to transport Jackson&#x27;s antique cars from California to his new residence in Claremore, Oklahoma when he began sweating and complaining of chest pains. His last words were to his business associate Terry Harvey Maltbia, &quot;I ain&#x27;t feeling good in my chest.&quot; Gallup police stated they were alerted to Jackson being in need of medical attention near a mall before he was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead aged 70. 

On November 4, 2024, Jackson was buried in a private family garden in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills following a memorial service attended by family members and friends at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, where his brother Michael and father Joe are also buried.

<text>Thomas James (c. 1573 – August 1629) was an English librarian and Anglican clergyman, the first librarian of the Bodleian Library, Oxford.

==Life==
James was born about 1573 at Newport, Isle of Wight. In 1586 he was admitted a scholar of Winchester College and matriculated at New College, Oxford, on 28 January 1592. He then graduated B.A. on 3 May 1595, M.A. on 5 February 1599, and B.D. and D.D. on 16 May 1614.

James became a fellow of New College in 1593, where he served until 1602. In that year, his wide knowledge of books, together with his skill in deciphering manuscripts and detecting literary forgeries, secured him the post of librarian to the library newly founded by Sir Thomas Bodley at Oxford.

At the same time, he was made rector of St Aldate&#x27;s Church, Oxford. In 1605, he compiled a classified catalogue of the books in the Bodleian Library, but in 1620 substituted for it an alphabetical catalogue. The arrangement in 1610, whereby the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers (Stationers&#x27; Company) undertook to supply the Bodleian with a copy of every book published, was James&#x27;s suggestion.

He assisted in framing a complete body of the ancient statutes and customs of the university. He was also skilled in deciphering manuscripts and in detecting forged readings. He obtained leave to examine the manuscripts in the college libraries at Oxford, and was allowed by easy-going heads of houses (particularly those of Balliol and Merton) to take away several, chiefly patristic, which he gave in 1601 to the Bodleian Library, together with sixty printed volumes.

Bodley had fixed upon James as his library keeper, and the appointment was confirmed by the university in 1602. His salary as librarian was initially £22 13s. 4d. annually, but he threatened to resign unless it was raised to £30 or £40 a year. Bodley raised the salary by 4 pounds per year. This eventually led to a compensation of 40 pounds per year after 1611. On 14 September 1602 he also became rector of St. Aldate, Oxford. 18 October of that same year, James married his wife, Ann Underhill. Both of these actions, taking place just two months before the library&#x27;s opening, were in direct opposition to qualifications outlined by Bodley for his librarian. Bodley, who had not been a churchgoer or the marrying type, wanted his librarian to be completely concentrated on the library. Eventually, however, Bodley approved of James&#x27;s choices.

In December 1610 the library began to receive copies of all works published by the members of the Stationers&#x27; Company, under an agreement made with them by Bodley at the suggestion of James. In 1614 James, through Bodley&#x27;s interest, was preferred to the sub-deanery of Wells, and in 1617 he became rector of Mongeham, Kent. At the beginning of May 1620 he was obliged through ill-health to resign the librarianship.

At the convocation held with the parliament at Oxford in 1625 he moved that certain scholars be commissioned to peruse the patristic manuscripts in all public and private English libraries to detect forgeries introduced by Roman Catholic editors. His proposal not meeting with much encouragement, he set about the task himself. Ill health compelled him to resign his post in 1620, he died at Oxford in August 1629, and was buried in New College Chapel.

==Works==
His first attempts at authorship were translations from the Italian of Antonio Brucioli&#x27;s &#x27;Commentary upon the Canticle of Canticles,&#x27; which was licensed for the press in November 1597, and from the French of Guillaume du Vair &quot;The Moral Philosophy of the Stoicks&quot;, London, 1598. He next edited Richard de Bury&#x27;s The Philobiblon, Oxford, 1599, which he dedicated to Sir Thomas Bodley. In this dedication, James praised Bodley and his colleagues for their efforts in reestablishing the Oxford library, though there was never any indication of his future role as librarian. As the result of his researches in college libraries he published &#x27;Ecloga Oxonio-Cantabrigiensis, tributa in libros duos,&#x27; London, 1600, a work commended by Joseph Scaliger. It gives a list of the manuscripts in the college libraries at Oxford and Cambridge, and in the university library at Cambridge, besides critical notes on the text of Cyprian&#x27;s &#x27;De Unitate Ecclesiæ&#x27; and of Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s &quot;De fide&quot;.

The &quot;Index Alphabeticus&quot; the first catalog compiled by James, which consisted of 8,700 entries, appeared in July 1605. It was dedicated to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, at the suggestion of Bodley (who thought that &#x27;more reward was to be gained from the prince than from the king&#x27;). It includes both printed books and manuscripts, arranged alphabetically under the four classes of theology, medicine, law, and arts. A continuation of this classified index, embracing writers on arts and sciences, geography and history, is to be found in Rawlinson MS. Miscell. 730, drawn up by James after quitting the library. An alphabetical catalogue prepared by him in 1613 was not printed, but remained in the library. A second edition of the catalogue appeared in 1620. It abandoned the classified arrangement of the former catalogue, and adopts only one alphabet of names. There was also issued in 1635 &#x27;Catalogus Interpretum S. Scripturæ juxta numerorum ordinem qui extant in Bibliotheca Bodleiana olim a D. Jamesio ... concinnatus, nunc vero altera fere parte auctior redditus. ... Editio correcta,&#x27; Oxford. In 1604, Bodley noted some errors James had made in cataloguing the Hebrew manuscripts, suggesting that James should check with scholars fluent in Hebrew.

Before 1611, James was on a committee working on the Authorised Version of the Bible.

<text>Michael Dov Weissmandl () (25 October 190329 November 1957) was an Orthodox rabbi of the Oberlander Jews of present-day western Slovakia. Along with Gisi Fleischmann he was the leader of the Bratislava Working Group which attempted to save European Jews from deportation to Nazi death camps during the Holocaust and was the first person to urge Allied powers to bomb the railways leading to concentration camp gas chambers. Managing to escape from a sealed cattle car headed for Auschwitz in 1944, he later emigrated to America where he established a yeshiva and self-sustaining agricultural community in New York known as the Yeshiva Farm Settlement. Accusing the Zionist Jewish Agency of having frustrated his rescue efforts during the Holocaust, he became a staunch opponent of Zionism after the war.

==Early life==
Michael Ber was born in Debrecen, Hungary on 25 October 1903 (4 &quot;Cheshvan&quot; 5664 on the Hebrew calendar) to Yosef Weissmandl, a shochet. A few years later his family moved to Tyrnau (now Trnava, Slovakia). In 1931 he moved to Nitra to study under Rabbi Shmuel Dovid Ungar, whose daughter, Bracha Rachel, he married in 1937. He was thus an &quot;oberlander&quot; (from the central highlands of Europe), a non-Hasidic Jew.

Weissmandl was a scholar and an expert at deciphering ancient manuscripts. In order to carry out his research of these manuscripts, he traveled to the Bodleian Library in Oxford, England. It is related that he was treated with great respect by the Chief Librarian of the Bodleian after an episode when he correctly identified the author of a manuscript that had been misattributed by the library&#x27;s scholars.

==World War II and the Holocaust==
While at Oxford University, Weissmandl volunteered on 1 September 1939 to return to Slovakia as an agent of World Agudath Israel. When the Nazis gathered sixty rabbis from Burgenland and sent them to Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovakia refused them entry and Austria would not take them back. Weissmandl flew to England, where he was received by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Foreign Office. Explaining the tragic situation, he succeeded in obtaining entry visas to England for the sixty rabbis.

===The Working Group===
When the Nazis, aided by members of the puppet Slovak government, began their moves against the Slovak Jews in 1942, members of the Slovak &quot;Judenrat&quot; formed an underground organization called the Bratislava Working Group. It was led by Gisi Fleischmann and Weissmandl. The group&#x27;s main activity was to help and save Jews as much as possible, in part through payment of bribes and ransom to German and Slovak officials. In 1942, the Working Group initiated high-level ransom negotiations with the Germans (ref. Fuchs and Kranzler books). The transportation of Slovak Jews was in fact halted for two years after they arranged a $50,000 (in 1952 dollars) ransom deal with the Nazi SS official Dieter Wisliceny.

Largely with the help of diplomats, Gisi Fleischmann and possibly also Weissmandl was able to smuggle letters or telegrams to people he hoped would help save the Jews of Europe, alerting them to the progressive Nazi destruction of European Jewry. He and Gisi Fleischmann managed to send letters to Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and he entrusted a diplomat to deliver a letter to the Vatican for Pope Pius XII. He originated the proposal via Rabbi Solomon Schonfeld in London to bomb the rails leading to Auschwitz, but this, along with subsequent suggestions from others, were ignored.

The Working Group helped distribute the Auschwitz Protocols. Kasztner was the first to get it in April 1944 during his Bratislava visit. The recipients didn&#x27;t do anything meaningful with the report except Moshe Krausz in Budapest who sent it to George Mantello in Switzerland around 19 June 1944 via Romanian diplomat Florian Manilou who was Mantello&#x27;s friend. Mantello received the reports early 21 June 1944 and publicized its content right away. This immediately triggered large-scale grass roots demonstrations in Switzerland, sermons in Swiss churches about the barbarism, tragic plight of Jews and starting 24 June 1944 an extraordinary Swiss press campaign of about 400 articles in German, French, Italian protesting the atrocities against Jews.

The events in Switzerland and possibly other considerations led to threats of retribution against Hungary&#x27;s Regent Miklós Horthy by President Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and others. This was one of the main factors which forced Horthy to order on 7 July 1944 stopping the death camp transports by Hungary, which until then took 
about 12,000 Hungarian Jews a day to Auschwitz.

===Deportation===
In October 1944, Weissmandl and his family were rounded up and put on a train headed for Auschwitz. Weissmandl escaped from the sealed train by opening a hole with a saw he had secreted in a loaf of bread. He jumped from the moving train and made his way to Bratislava. There he found shelter in a bunker in a storage room of a private house, along with 17 other Jews who included the Rebbe of Stropkov Menachem Mendel Halberstam.

Rezső Kasztner visited the bunker several times, once, to the consternation of the inhabitants, in the company of SS officer Max Grüson. In April 1945, Kasztner visited again, this time in the company of another SS officer who took the party to Switzerland in a truck with an escort of German soldiers. On arriving in Switzerland, Weissmandl suffered a major heart attack.

==Post-war America==

===Personal recovery===
After the war, Weissmandl arrived in the United States having lost his family and having been unable to save Slovak Jewry. At first, he was so distraught that he would pound the walls and cry bitterly on what had befallen his people. Later he remarried and had children, but he never forgot his family in Europe and suffered from depression his entire life because of the Holocaust.

His second marriage was to Leah Teitelbaum (1924/5–9 April 2009), a daughter of Rabbi Chaim Eliyahu Teitelbaum and a native of Beregszász, Hungary. With his second wife, Weissmandl had five children.

===Establishment of an American yeshiva===
:&quot;See: Yeshiva of Nitra&quot;
In November 1946, Weissmandl and his brother-in-law, Rabbi Sholom Moshe Ungar, re-established the Nitra Yeshiva in Somerville, New Jersey, gathering surviving students from the original Nitra Yeshiva. With the help of Rabbi Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz, Weissmandl bought the Brewster estate in Mount Kisco, in Westchester County, New York and moved his Yeshiva there in 1949. There he established a self-sustaining agricultural community known as the &quot;Yeshiva Farm Settlement&quot;. At first, this settlement was not welcome by its neighbors, but in a town hall meeting, Helen Bruce Baldwin (1907–1994) of nearby Chappaqua, wife of New York Times military correspondent and Pulitzer Prize winner, Hanson W. Baldwin, impressed by Weissmandl, defended its establishment and wrote a letter-to-the-editor to the New York Times regarding it. Weissmandl designed the community&#x27;s yeshiva to conform with Talmudic accounts of agricultural settlements, where a man would study Torah continuously until an age suitable for marriage, whereupon he would farm during the day and study in the evenings. While this novel approach was not fully realized, the yeshiva flourished. Currently, the settlement is known as the Nitra community.
(See also Kashau (Hasidic dynasty)).

===Later life===
During his later years, Weissmandl suffered from chronic heart disease and was frequently hospitalized. He suffered a severe heart attack in the early winter of 1957 and was hospitalized for several weeks. Upon his release, he attended the yeshiva&#x27;s fundraising banquet, and then was readmitted to the hospital. His health deteriorated and he died on Friday, 29 November 1957 (6 Kislev 5718) at the age of 54. His second wife never remarried.

Weissmandl is buried in the Beth Israel Cemetery - also known as Woodbridge Memorial Gardens - in Woodbridge New Jersey, in the Khal Adas Yereim Vien section. On 1 September 2021, his son Rabbi Shmuel Dovid Weissmandl died aged 69 in floodwaters in Elmsford, New York.

==Religious work==

===Books===
Two of Weissmandl&#x27;s books were published posthumously.
* &quot;Toras Chemed&quot; (Mt. Kisco, 1958) is a book of religious writings that includes many commentaries and homilies, as well as hermeneutic material of a kabbalistic nature. Included in this book are the observations that led to what is called the Torah Codes.
* &quot;Min HaMeitzar&quot; (Jerusalem, 1960) is a book that describes Rabbi Weissmandl&#x27;s war-time experiences. The title consists of the first two words of Psalm 118:5, meaning &quot;from the depths of despair&quot;, literally &quot;From the Straits&quot;. This is the main publication in which Weissmandl&#x27;s accusations against the Zionist organizations appear. In the book Rabbi Weissmandl quotes part of a letter sent to the Bratislava Working Group by Nathan Schwalb of the Jewish Agency &quot;Pioneer&quot; (Hehalutz) group. The letter essentially says that the Allies are shedding their blood on the battle field and after defeating the Nazis will divide Europe, as happened after World War I. The Jews of Europe too must shed their blood in order to have right to claim a post-war state: Israel. The letter then states that money is enclosed for the Bratislava Jewish leaders to go on an &quot;outing&quot; (escape to Palestine).

According to Yehuda Bauer, the book reflects Weissmandl&#x27;s ideological biases and was edited by Weissmandl&#x27;s relatives after his death, limiting the historical reliability of the book. For example, it does not mention the last two transports from Slovakia in October 1942, which contradict Weissmandl&#x27;s belief that the Working Group&#x27;s bribes were responsible for the cessation of deportation.

In 1958, Rabbi Weissmandl republished the magnum opus of Rabbi Jonah Teomim-Frankel, &quot;Kikayon D&#x27;Yonah&quot; with his own footnotes and glosses. In the introduction to this volume, Rabbi Weissmandl gives an emotional history lesson.

<text>3T is an American R&amp;B/pop music trio featuring the three sons of Tito Jackson (from the Jackson 5) and Delores &quot;Dee Dee&quot; Jackson, from whom they inherit their Dominican ancestry. The band members include, from eldest, Tariano Adaryll Jackson II (&quot;Taj&quot;) (born August 4, 1973), Taryll Adren Jackson (born August 8, 1975) and Tito Joe Jackson (&quot;TJ&quot;) (born July 16, 1978). Their late uncle Michael Jackson mentored the trio, and signed them to his label MJJ Music.

==History==

===&quot;Brotherhood&quot; (1995–1997)===
3T released their debut album &quot;Brotherhood&quot; in 1995. The album sold approximately three million copies worldwide. The group achieved an international hit with their debut single &quot;Anything&quot;. 3T released several hit singles in Europe, including &quot;24/7&quot;, &quot;Why&quot; (a duet with their uncle Michael Jackson), &quot;I Need You&quot; (with a brief appearance by Michael), &quot;Tease Me&quot; and &quot;Gotta Be You&quot;. In 1996, they were ranked second behind the Spice Girls, as the biggest-selling group in Europe. 3T have also written and produced songs for soundtracks to films such as; &quot;The Jacksons: An American Dream&quot;, &quot;Free Willy&quot;, &quot;Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home&quot;, &quot;Men in Black&quot; and &quot;Trippin&#x27;&quot;. In early 1997, they went on a hugely successful European tour with their album &quot;Brotherhood&quot;, which included all of the songs from the album, as well as a Jackson 5 tribute (featuring Tito &#x27;Poppa T&#x27;), and a surprise performance of the Oasis hit &quot;Wonderwall&quot;.

3T completed an album after the release of &quot;Brotherhood&quot;, with over 20 songs being recorded and 12 planned to be included on the final tracklist. The album was never released by Sony due to a strained relationship with Michael Jackson (MJJ Music), and is considered by many fans to be &quot;The Lost Album&quot;.

===&quot;Identity&quot; (2003–2005)===
Taryll and T. J. have written and produced tracks for their aunt Janet Jackson as well as for Lindsay Lohan and Bruno Mars. After signing with the French label TF1/NRJ in 2003, 3T continued to perform in France, the Netherlands and Belgium. The group signed with the Dutch label Digidance in 2004 for Dutch releases, appearances, and performances. The album titled &quot;Identity&quot; was released on March 23, 2004. Two singles were released: &quot;Stuck On You&quot; (a cover of the Lionel Richie song) was released in 2003 in France and Belgium and in 2004 in the Netherlands, and &quot;Sex Appeal&quot; in 2004. Neither single was released outside of Europe. In 2008, 3T made &quot;Identity&quot; available on both iTunes and amazon.com worldwide.

===On-and-off appearances (2007–2011)===
The brothers appeared on the show &quot;This Is David Gest&quot; in 2007, including recording the theme tune &quot;Crazy Kinda Guy&quot;. The show began on April 22, 2007. They appeared in an episode where Gest took cameras for a rare glimpse of the Jackson family house in Encino, California, where he met Tito and 3T as well as matriarch Katherine Jackson, as well as a later episode showing them recording the theme tune. The brothers would occasionally bring Jermajesty on tour as an on and off DJ.

During the summer of 2008, the Jackson family (including Tito) stayed at a holiday let (rental) for six weeks in Appledore, Devon, England while searching for a house to buy in the area. The project was filmed for a Channel 4 documentary called &quot;The Jacksons are Coming&quot;, which was aired in 2008. Taj and T. J. appear with their father, but Taryll did not join them on the trip. The three family members also attended a Michael Jackson fan event in Devon as part of their stay, ringing him up during the event which led to Michael talking to the fans over a loudspeaker on the phone.

All three of them appeared on the A&amp;E TV show entitled &quot;The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty&quot;. They appear with their father Tito, who is trying to convince them to relaunch their career.

On January 31, 2010, the three brothers appeared on stage at the 52nd Grammy Awards to support their cousins Prince Michael, Jr. and Paris Michael Katherine Jackson as they accepted the Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of their father, Michael Jackson. On February 1, 2010, all three brothers then appeared in the remake of &quot;We Are the World&quot;, this time in aid of the Haiti Appeal. However, they did not sing the main parts of the song and instead contributed to the background vocals. Currently, Taj is working on the &quot;Code Z&quot; zombie series and a science fiction project called &quot;Clone 3&quot;. T. J. was selected to play the role of Prince Jean-Luc in the new stage version of Larry Hart&#x27;s musical &quot;Sisterella&quot; that was scheduled to premiere in the fall of 2011. Taryll is working on his first solo album that he hopes will make his family and fans proud.

On October 8, 2011, 3T performed at the Michael Forever – The Tribute Concert held at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. They performed the Jacksons&#x27; track &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; (also known as &quot;This Place Hotel&quot;) followed by their own number 2 hit single &quot;Why&quot;, which was originally a duet recorded with Michael for their 1995 album &quot;Brotherhood&quot;. At the end of the performance of &quot;Why&quot;, all three brothers broke down into tears. They then appeared in the finale of the show performing Michael&#x27;s hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Til You Get Enough&quot; with various other performers from the concert as well as members of the Jackson family who had been in attendance, including Michael&#x27;s children Prince, Paris and Blanket (Prince II).

===Charity tour, &quot;The Big Reunion&quot; and &quot;Chapter III&quot; (2013–present)===
After almost two years away from the stage, 3T performed live on stage in Rome, Milan, Torino, and Verona during four charity concerts in Italy from December 5–8. 3T performed a 30-minute show and the setlist featured &quot;Stuck On You&quot;, &#x27;Anything&#x27;, &#x27;I Need You&#x27;, the new song &#x27;Forever Girl&#x27;, &#x27;With You&#x27;, a jam session (Ed Sheeran&#x27;s &#x27;The A-Team&#x27;, Oasis&#x27; &#x27;Wonderwall&#x27; and &#x27;Give Me All Your Lovin&#x27;) and &#x27;We Are the World&#x27;.

On December 26, 2013, British television station ITV2 announced that 3T would be part of season 2 of &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;. The episodes were broadcast on ITV2 between February 6 and March 27, 2014. Along with 3T, the other bands that took part were A1, Damage, Eternal, Girl Thing and 5th Story. On February 21 &quot;The Big Reunion&quot; concert took place in a sold out Hammersmith Apollo in London and was broadcast on ITV2 on March 27, 2014.

On March 20, 2014, it was announced that the boy bands from both series (Five, 911, Blue, A1, 3T, Damage and 5th Story) would go on &quot;The Big Reunion Boy Band Tour&quot; in October 2014.

On September 27, 2014, 3T performed at a sold-out event in Rotterdam Ahoy. The next day, on September 28, 2014, 3T were special guests on the popular Dutch TV show &quot;Carlo &amp; Irene: Life 4 You&quot;. 3T share a special history with Carlo &amp; Irene since they have been guests on their previous TV shows &quot;Telekids&quot; in 1996 and &quot;Carlo &amp; Irene: Life &amp; Cooking&quot; in 2003. During their interview on &quot;Carlo &amp; Irene: Life 4 You&quot; 3T talked about their performance at the event and performed one of their new songs called &quot;Forever Girl&quot;. On September 29, 2014, 3T were guests at dj Giel Beelen on radio NPO 3FM. After their interview with DJ Giel Beelen, 3T performed &#x27;I Need You&#x27; live on radio NPO 3FM. 3T also visited DJ One&#x27;sy on FunX radio where one lucky fan got the chance to meet Taj, Taryll and T. J. in the studio because she won the meet &amp; greet contest organized by FunX radio. To thank their fans for their continuing support a meet &amp; greet was held later that day at the NH Schiller hotel in Amsterdam.

On March 12, 2015, Dutch radio station Q-music announced 3T would perform at the &quot;Foute Party&quot; on June 26, 2015. The event took place at the Brabanthallen in &#x27;s Hertogenbosch, Netherlands.

On September 16, 2016, 3T had their up Close and Personal in RAI Amsterdam. A surprise concert was held September 17 as well, showcasing the album launch of &quot;Chapter III&quot; at the Melkweg concert venue in Amsterdam, Netherlands

On September 1, 2018, 3T performed their greatest hits at La Cigale, Paris, France. Following this sold-out concert at La Cigale, on May 18 and 19, 2019, 3T returned to Paris, France to perform 2 unplugged shows at the Nouveau Casino de Paris. On August 29, 2018, 3T went to Naples, Italy to honor their uncle Michael Jackson on MJ Day, organized by MJJ Foundation Naples-Onlus. They held a press conference at Gran Teatro - Edenlandia before they performed at Teatro Mediterraneo. On December 16, 2018, 3T performed at La Madeleine in Brussels, Belgium, it had been 20 years since they last performed in Belgium.

On May 7, 2022, 3T performed their biggest hits at &quot;Forever 90&quot; at Zénith in Strasbourg, France.

On August 27, 2022, 3T headlined and performed at one of the biggest dance festivals in Europe, &quot;We Love the 90s&quot; at a sold-out Goffertpark in Nijmegen, Netherlands. The 10th anniversary was originally planned for 2020. The Covid pandemic postponed it twice.

==Taj Jackson&#x27;s later work==
Taj Jackson directed the short film &quot;Code Z&quot; in 2014, that Big Screen Entertainment Group optioned the rights to. The script was written by Taj and the Brazilian Sco triplets (Thaisa, Thaina, and Thayana Sco) Thayana is Taj&#x27;s wife.

In 2015, Taj executive produced the reality series &quot;The Jacksons: Next Generation&quot;. His brothers Taryll and TJ also co-produced the series.

In 2018, Taj directed the music video for 3T&#x27;s song &quot;Fire&quot;.

Taj is now currently working on his forthcoming documentary series where he will tell his uncle Michael Jackson story, saying &quot;This documentary series will conclusively destroy decades of salacious myths which have been told and sold about Michael Jackson ad nauseam. In doing so, we will shine a light on the corruption within the media and entertainment industries which conceived and perpetuated them.&quot; iHeartRadio reported on January 26, 2019. Taj has been vocal about how the allegations against Michael were false and defamatory. He said he felt betrayed by Wade Robson, who asked him to help get seats for him and his whole family at Michael&#x27;s 2009 memorial.

==Taryll Jackson&#x27;s solo career==
Taryll released his debut solo single &quot;4Ever&quot; on April 5, 2012, from his debut EP, &quot;My Life Without You&quot; which was released on Mother&#x27;s Day, May 13, 2012, in honor of his mother Dee Dee Jackson. Other songs on this E.P are &quot;My Life Without You&quot;, &quot;When You Come Back To Earth&quot;, &quot;Doubt&quot;, &quot;Be My Girl&quot;, &quot;When It Falls Down&quot; and &quot;Unlove You&quot;.

On his birthday, August 8, 2012, Taryll released the single &quot;Best of All Time&quot;, a tribute to his uncle Michael Jackson. The single is taken from his second EP &quot;Undeniable&quot;, which was released on August 29, 2012, in honor of Michael. Other songs on this E.P are &quot;Undeniable&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Falling In Love&quot;,
&quot;Tonight&quot;, &quot;Hope&quot;, &quot;You Girl&quot;, &quot;Dance Floor&quot; and &quot;What Can I Do To Change Your Mind?&quot;.

On April 21, 2019, Taryll released the 10 track-album &quot;Crazy Love&quot;, and on June 8, 2019, Taryll performed his first solo concert at the Melkweg in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Taryll&#x27;s father Tito Jackson surprised him right before his concert, and later joined him on stage together with Taryll&#x27;s partner Breana Cabral, and sons Bryce Connor and Adren Michael.

On July 17, 2020, Taryll released the full solo project, &quot;Digital 8&quot;. Beyond the original 2012 solo debut EP&#x27;s &quot;My Life Without You&quot; and &quot;Undeniable&quot;, the 50 song-album includes completely remastered songs, special mixes, previously unreleased songs and bonus tracks.

==TJ Jackson&#x27;s solo career==
On March 20, 2020, TJ released his debut solo E.P &quot;Obsession&quot; featuring his first single &quot;Insomnia&quot;.Other songs on this E.P. are &quot;Obsession&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand It&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Deserve this&quot; and #1 Fan. TJ went to Nashville, Tennessee to record and produce the E.P, and he wanted to mix the current urban sound with his 90&#x27;s R&amp;B roots. On November 20, 2020, TJ released his second E.P &quot;Damaged&quot; which includes the single &quot;Last Night, and two other songs; &quot;Good Time&quot; and &quot;Senseless Drama&quot; 

On March 26, 2021, TJ released the first single &quot;Dreamgirl&quot; off his project &quot;Magic Mystery Memories&quot; (MMM). The second single &quot;Secret&quot; was released May 7, and the third single &quot;A Night To Remember&quot; (co-written with Rhyan Shirley and David Thulin) was released July 2. &quot;Secret&quot; was inspired by his uncle Michael Jackson, and so was the single&#x27;s artwork. TJ also wanted to pay homage to the R&amp;B he grew up on with this project.

On May 27, 2022, TJ released his first solo album &quot;Acoustic Sessions 1&quot; a 9 track acoustic album which includes his stripped-down cover of &quot;Human Nature&quot; in honor of his uncle Michael, and on June, 24 he released the single &quot; Heaven on My Lips&quot; (co-written with Sam Tinnesz and David Thulin) the first single from his forthcoming album, &quot;Pressure&quot;. On this album TJ wanted to focus on live instrumentation. On June 24 and 26, and July 1, 2022, TJ embarked on his first European solo tour &quot;A Night To Remember&quot; at the Théâtre de la Contrescarpe in Paris, France performing the acoustic versions from the album. TJ&#x27;s father Tito Jackson came to Paris to support him and his wife Frances Jackson, and children Royal Jackson, Delores Dior Jackson, Dallas Jackson and Rio Jackson as a surprise. The tour included stops in France, Spain, Italy, England, Belgium, and the Netherlands.

<doc id="304325" wikidata="Q464680" url="?curid=304325" title="Wayne Rainey">
<text>Wayne Wesley Rainey (born October 23, 1960) is an American former Grand Prix motorcycle road racer. He competed in the FIM Grand Prix motorcycle racing world championships in 1984 and from 1988 to 1993. He won the 500cc World Championship three times and the Daytona 200 once. He was characterized by his smooth, calculating riding style, and for his intense rivalry with compatriot Kevin Schwantz, between 1987 and 1993.

==Racing history==
Rainey began his career racing in the A.M.A. Grand National Championship, a series that encompassed four distinct dirt track disciplines plus road races. In 1981, he finished the Grand National season as the 15th ranked dirt track racer in the country. Following his success in the Novice 250cc roadrace class, Kawasaki hired him to compete in the 1982 AMA Superbike Championship as a teammate to the then defending National Champion Eddie Lawson. The following year, Lawson moved to the Grand Prix circuit and Rainey took over the role of leading rider, earning the 1983 National Championship for Kawasaki.

In 1984, he accepted an offer to ride for the newly formed Kenny Roberts Yamaha racing team in the 250cc class of the Grand Prix World Championship. A less than successful season (1 podium and difficulty push-starting the bike) saw him returning home in 1985 to join the Maclean Racing team in U.S. 250 and Formula 1 classes, and then on to the American Honda team from 1986 to 1987 where he raced Superbike and F1. It was during the 1987 Superbike National Championship that his intense rivalry began with Kevin Schwantz as the two battled it out for the title. Rainey won the Championship, but the fierce rivalry between the two competitors was just beginning. So intense was their rivalry that they continued their battle during the 1987 Transatlantic Trophy match races in which they were supposedly teammates competing against a team of British riders.
In 1988 Rainey returned to Europe, again joining Team Roberts Yamaha, this time in the premier 500cc division riding the YZR500. His arch-rival Schwantz followed him to Europe, signing to race the 500cc class for Team Suzuki. The two would continue their rivalry on race tracks all across Europe, driving each other to higher levels of competitiveness. In 1988, Rainey won his first world championship race at the British Grand Prix. Also in 1988, he and his Team Roberts Yamaha teammate Kevin Magee won the prestigious Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race in Japan. In the 1989 campaign, Rainey finished second overall behind Eddie Lawson, winning three races and placing on the podium in every race that he finished. 

From 1990 to 1992, Rainey hit his stride earning three consecutive 500cc crowns for Yamaha. Rainey was involved in a hard-fought campaign with Kevin Schwantz while seeking his fourth-consecutive title in 1993. He was leading the championship by a margin of 11 points over Schwantz, and leading the GP when he suffered his career-ending crash at the Italian Grand Prix in Misano. He slid into the gravel trap at high speed, breaking his spine against the raked surface designed as a safety feature for car racing. The injury handed the title to his great rival Kevin Schwantz. Rainey&#x27;s injuries rendered him permanently paralyzed from the chest down.

After turning to Williams team owner and quadriplegic Frank Williams for advice, Rainey later became the team manager for Marlboro Yamaha for a few years. After the 1995 season, Schwantz retired from the Grand Prix circuit, partly due to nagging injuries and partly because losing the one great rival that had fired his competitive intensity made him view his own mortality much more clearly.

Rainey refused to give up racing despite his disability and raced a hand-controlled Superkart in the World SuperKart series based in Northern California.

He lived in Monterey, California in a house that is not far from WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca. The nearby circuit named a corner in his honor, Rainey Curve, which is a medium-speed, acute left-hander that follows the famous Corkscrew. Rainey was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1999. The FIM named him a Grand Prix &quot;Legend&quot; in 2000. He was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2007. In 2003, he was one of the subjects of the motorcycle racing documentary film, &quot;Faster&quot;.

After several seasons of poor decisions by Daytona Motorsports Group, the organization that operated AMA-sanctioned road racing beginning in 2009, a dispute with Dorna/Infront in 2013 regarding AMA Superbike coverage on shared FIM weekends led to a lack of media coverage for that year&#x27;s Superbike round at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca, as well as the Harley-Davidson XR1200 round at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in both 2013 and 2014, the AMA transferred the commercial rights to AMA-sanctioned road racing to Rainey and his business partners at the end of 2014. The MotoAmerica era of AMA-sanctioned road racing began in 2015.

Rainey lives in Monterey, California, with his wife Shae. They have one son, Rex, who graduated from Pepperdine University and works at CBS Television Distribution with the &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; and &quot;The Insider&quot; accounts.

Rainey rode his 1992 YZR500 at the 2022 Goodwood Festival of Speed. Yamaha specially modified the bike by moving the rear brake and gear shift controls to the handlebars.

<text>Spandau () is the westernmost of the 12 boroughs () of Berlin, situated at the confluence of the Havel and Spree rivers and extending along the western bank of the Havel. It is the smallest borough by population, but the fourth largest by land area.

==Overview==
Modern industries in Spandau include metalworking, and chemical and electrical factories. BMW Motorrad&#x27;s Spandau factory made all BMW&#x27;s motorcycles from 1969 until final assembly plants were added in Rayong, Thailand, in 2000, and Manaus, Brazil, in 2016.

, Spandau&#x27;s seat of government, was built in 1913. Other landmarks include the Renaissance-era Spandau Citadel, the 1848 St. Marien am Behnitz Catholic church designed by August Soller, and Spandau arsenal. That arsenal&#x27;s Spandau machine gun inspired the slang &quot;Spandau Ballet&quot; to describe dying soldiers on barbed wire during the First World War, and later was applied to the appearance of Nazi war criminals at Spandau Prison. In 1979, the English New Romantic band Spandau Ballet again re-purposed the term for its name.

==History==
The history of Spandau begins in the 7th century or 8th century, when the Slav Heveller first settled in the area and later built a fortress there. It was conquered in 928 by the German King Henry I, but returned to Slavic rule after the rebellion of 983.

In 1156, the Ascanian Earl Albrecht von Ballenstedt (&quot;Albrecht the Bear&quot;) took possession of the region. 1197 marked the first mention as &quot;Spandowe&quot; in a deed of Otto II, Margrave of Brandenburg – thus forty years earlier than the Cölln part of medieval Berlin. Spandau was given city rights in 1232.

During Ascanian rule the construction of Spandau Citadel began, which was completed between 1559 and 1594 by Joachim II of Brandenburg. In 1558 the village of Gatow became part of Spandau. In 1634, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Spandau was surrendered to the Swedes.

In 1806, after the Battle of Jena and Auerstedt, French troops under Napoleon took possession of the city and stayed there until 1807. In 1812, Napoleon returned, and the Citadel was besieged the following year by Prussian and Russian troops.

From 1849 the poet and revolutionary Gottfried Kinkel was an inmate of Spandau town prison, until he was freed by his friend Carl Schurz in the night of 6 November 1850.

Before World War I, Spandau was a seat of large government cannon foundries, factories for making gunpowder and other munitions of war, making it a centre of the arms industry in the German Empire. It was also a garrison town with numerous barracks, home of the 5th Guard Infantry Brigade and the 5th Guard Foot Regiment of the German Army. In 1920, Spandau (whose name had been changed from &quot;Spandow&quot; in 1878) was incorporated into Greater Berlin as a borough.

During World War II, Spandau was the location of a subcamp of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, mostly for Polish and Hungarian women.

After World War II, it was part of the British sector of West Berlin. Spandau Prison, which had been rebuilt in 1876, was used to house Nazi war criminals given custodial sentences at the Nuremberg Trials. After the death of Spandau Prison&#x27;s last inmate, Rudolf Hess, in 1987, it was completely demolished by the Allied powers and later replaced by a shopping mall.

Gatow airfield, in the south of the district, was used by the Royal Air Force during the post-war Allied occupation, most notably during the Berlin Airlift. Since 1995 the airfield has been the Gatow Museum of Military History.

==Geography==
Outside Berlin, Spandau borders the districts () of Oberhavel to the north, and Havelland to the west, and the city of Potsdam, Brandenburg, to the southwest. Within Berlin, it borders the boroughs of Steglitz-Zehlendorf to the south, Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf to the east, and Reinickendorf to the northeast. Its land area of is the fourth-largest of the twelve boroughs.

===Subdivisions===

Spandau Borough is divided into nine quarters ():

* Spandau
* Haselhorst
* Siemensstadt
* Staaken
* Gatow
* Kladow
* Hakenfelde
* Falkenhagener Feld
* Wilhelmstadt

==Demographics==
As of 2010, Spandau had a population of 223,962, the smallest of the twelve boroughs of Berlin. 62,000 of those were migrants or other non-ethnic Germans, comprising 27% of Spandau&#x27;s population.
==Politics==

<text>Claude Marcelle Jorré, better known as Claude Jade (; 8 October 1948 – 1 December 2006), was a French actress. She starred as Christine in François Truffaut&#x27;s three films &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot; (1968), &quot;Bed and Board&quot; (1970) and &quot;Love on the Run&quot; (1979). Jade acted in theatre, film and television. Her film work outside France included the Soviet Union, the United States (Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Topaz&quot;), Italy, Belgium, Germany and Japan. She was most famous on television as the heroine of the mysterious adventure series &quot;The Island of Thirty Coffins&quot; (1979). She was also the leading actress in the first French daily soap &quot;Cap des Pins&quot; (1998-2000). Her last role was in 2006 playing Célimène in Célimène et le cardinal.

==Early career==
The daughter of university professors, Jade spent three years at Dijon&#x27;s Conservatory of Dramatic Art. In 1964 she played on stage 40 times the part of Agnès in Molière&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;école des femmes&quot;. In 1966 she won the Prix de Comédie for Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s stage play &quot;Ondine&quot;, performed at the Comédie Boulogne. She moved to Paris and became a student of Jean-Laurent Cochet at the Edouard VII theater, and began acting in television productions, including a leading role in TV series &quot;Les oiseaux rares&quot;.

==Films with François Truffaut==

While performing as Frida in Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Henri IV&quot;, in a production by Sacha Pitoëff at the Théâtre Moderne, Jade was discovered by New Wave film director François Truffaut. He was &quot;completely taken by her beauty, her manners, her kindness, and her &quot;joie de vivre&quot;&quot;, and cast her in the role of Christine Darbon in &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot; (&quot;Baisers volés&quot;, 1968). During the filming, Truffaut fell in love with her, and there was talk of marriage. Truffaut dubbed Claude Jade “French cinema’s little sweetheart” and the director and his muse were soon a couple in real life, although Truffaut changed his mind about marrying her the night before their wedding. 

American critic Pauline Kael wrote that Jade &quot;seems a less ethereal, more practical Catherine Deneuve&quot;.

Playing the same character at different stages of her life, Jade appeared in three Truffaut films: loved from a distance in &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot;; married and misled in &quot;Bed and Board&quot; (&quot;Domicile Conjugal&quot;, 1970); and divorced but still on good terms in &quot;Love on the Run&quot; (1979).

==The late 1960s in film==
Some months after Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot; Claude Jade starred in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Topaz&quot; (1969), as Michèle Picard, a secret agent&#x27;s anxious daughter, married to a reporter (Michel Subor). Recommended to Hitchcock by Truffaut, she was 19 years old when cast, with Dany Robin playing her mother. Hitchcock said he chose the two actresses to provide glamor, and later quipped, &quot;Claude Jade is a rather quiet young lady, but I wouldn&#x27;t guarantee [that] about her behavior in a taxi&quot;. Jade recounted that they &quot;talked in a Paris hotel about cooking, and I gave him my recipe for soufflé and told him I liked &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;, and that was that.&quot; 

Hitchcock said she resembled his former star Grace Kelly, and in France she was a younger Danielle Darrieux. Some of her scenes were deleted and restored for the director&#x27;s cut of &quot;Topaz&quot; in 1999. &quot;Topaz&quot; was Jade&#x27;s only Hollywood film. Universal Pictures offered her a seven-year contract, which she turned down reportedly because she preferred to work in French.
Director Tony Richardson&#x27;s film &quot;Nijinsky&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Dancer&quot;) (1970), based on a screenplay by Edward Albee, was canceled during pre-production by producer Harry Saltzman. It was to have starred Jade as Vaslav Nijinsky&#x27;s wife, with Rudolf Nureyev as Nijinsky and Paul Scofield as his lover Sergei Diaghilev. 

She had a leading role as Linda in &quot;Sous le signe de Monte-Cristo&quot; (&quot;Under the Sign of Monte Cristo&quot;) by André Hunebelle, a modern version of Alexandre Dumas&#x27; novel. Here the 19 years young actress starred alongside French cinema&#x27;s veterans like Pierre Brasseur and Michel Auclair. 

Jade starred in Édouard Molinaro&#x27;s &quot;My Uncle Benjamin&quot; (&quot;Mon oncle Benjamin&quot;, 1969) alongside Jacques Brel. As Manette she refuses Brel&#x27;s advances until he produces a marriage contract. At the End Manette realizes she prefers happiness to a marriage contract after all. 

Her career continued in Belgium, where she played a young English teacher who is fatally intrigued by a murderer (Gérard Barray) in the 1969 film &quot;The Witness&quot;. Her fiancé is this movie was played by Jean-Claude Dauphin, to whom she was engaged at this time. Also in 1969, she starred as Helena in a film adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; by Jean-Christophe Averty, &quot;Le Songe d&#x27;une nuit d&#x27;été&quot; .

==The 1970s in film and TV==
In 1970 she reprised her part as Christine from &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot; in Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Bed and Board&quot; as a married woman. The Truffaut films influenced her type as lovingly gentle modern young woman in contemporary cinema, which she contrasted in ambivalent figures: Critic Vincent Canby praised her in work in Gérard Brach&#x27;s &quot;The Boat on the Grass&quot; (&quot;Le bateau sur l&#x27;herbe&quot;, 1971), in which she starred as Eleonore, a young girl between two friends (Jean-Pierre Cassel, John McEnery). She starred in &quot;Hearth Fires&quot; (&quot;Les feux de la chandeleur&quot;, 1972) as Laura, a daughter who wants to reconcile her parents (Annie Girardot, Jean Rochefort) and who falls in love with her mother&#x27;s best friend (Bernard Fresson). Alongside Robert Hossein she played the priest&#x27;s love Françoise in &quot;Forbidden Priests&quot; (&quot;Prêtres interdits&quot;, 1973). In &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; (1973), she played a hardened nurse who is changed by a love affair with a social worker (Jacques Perrin).

Jade played a dual role in &quot;The Choice&quot;, 1976). She starred in three Italian films: as a private investigator in &quot;Number One&quot; (1973), as Tiffany, the girlfriend of a private eye (Frederick Stafford, her father from &quot;Topaz&quot;) in &quot;La ragazza di via Condotti&quot; (1973), and as Maria Teresa, an unhappily married woman in Eriprando Visconti&#x27;s &quot;A Spiral of Mist&quot; (&quot;Una spirale di nebbia&quot;, 1977). She played a nun in &quot;Kita No Misaki - Cap du Nord&quot; (1976) by Japanese director Kei Kumai. In the same year, she starred as Penny Vanderwood in &quot;Thinking Robots&quot;, based on a horror novel by George Langelaan. Among other films of the 1970s were &quot;Malicious Pleasure&quot; (&quot;Le malin plaisir&quot;, 1975), &quot;Trop c&#x27;est trop&quot; (1975) and the romantic comedy &quot;The Pawn&quot; (&quot;Le Pion&quot;, 1978), in which she starred as a young widow who wins the heart of her son&#x27;s teacher (Henri Guybet). One year later Claude Jade played the part of Christine Doinel for the third time in Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Love on the Run&quot;. 

In 1970 she starred as Orphan Françoise in mini-series &quot;Mauregard&quot;, directed by Truffaut&#x27;s co-writer Claude de Givray. Other TV roles in the decade were Sheherazade (in &quot;Shéhérazade&quot;) and Louise de La Vallière (in &quot;Le chateau perdu&quot;), Lucile Desmoulins (in &quot;La passion de Camille et Lucile Desmoulins&quot;). She starred in such television movies as &quot;Mamie Rose&quot;, &quot;La Mandragore&quot;, &quot;Monsieur Seul&quot;, &quot;Fou comme François&quot;, &quot;Les anneaux de Bicêtre&quot;, &quot;Ulysse est revenu&quot;, and, in her biggest success of that decade, as heroine Veronique d&#x27;Hergemont in the 1979 series &quot;The Island of Thirty Coffins&quot; (L&#x27;île aux trente cercueils).

==The 1980s in film and TV==
In the 1980s, Jade moved to Moscow for three years with her husband Bernard Coste, a French diplomat, and her son Pierre Coste (born in 1976). She starred in two Soviet films. In &quot;Teheran 43&quot; (1981) she played the mysterious terrorist Françoise, with Alain Delon and an international cast. For Sergei Yutkevich&#x27;s &quot;Lenin in Paris&quot; (1981), she played the French Bolshevik Inessa Armand, but without the rumored love affair with Vladimir Lenin.

Among her other film roles in the 1980s were the arrested philosophy prof in &quot;Schools Falling Apart&quot; (&quot;Le Bahut va craquer&quot;, 1981), the lawyer Valouin in &quot;A Captain&#x27;s Honor&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;honneur d&#x27;un capitaine&quot;, 1982), the Vicki Baum-heroine Evelyne Droste in &quot;Rendezvous in Paris&quot; (1982) and the mysterious Alice in René Féret&#x27;s thriller &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;homme qui n&#x27;était pas là&quot;, 1987).

==The 1990s in TV and film==
During the 1990s Jade worked mainly in television, such as the TV series &quot;La tête en l&#x27;air&quot; and &quot;Fleur bleue&quot;, as guest star in &quot;Une femme d&#x27;honneur&quot; (ep.&quot;Mémoire perdue&quot;), &quot;Inspecteur Moretti&quot; (ep. &quot;Un enfant au soleil&quot;), &quot;Julie Lescaut&quot; (ep. &quot;Rumeurs&quot;) and &quot;Navarro&quot; (ep. &quot;Sentiments mortels&quot;). TV movies included &quot;L&#x27;Éternité devant soi&quot;, &quot;Le bonheur des autres&quot;, &quot;Eugénie Grandet&quot; and &quot;Porté disparu&quot;. From 1998 to 2000 she was the lead actress in the series &quot;Tide of Life&quot; (&quot;Cap des Pins)&quot;. Her last U.S. acting part was a guest appearance on &quot;The Hitchhiker&quot;: in the episode &quot;Windows&quot; she is Monique, who shoots her neighbor David Marshall Grant at the end. 

Jade&#x27;s film roles in cinemas in 1990s included Gabrielle Martin, a mother betrayed by her husband, in &quot;Tableau d&#x27;honneur&quot;.

<text>In These Times is an American politically progressive monthly magazine of news and opinion published in Chicago, Illinois. It was established as a broadsheet-format fortnightly newspaper in 1976 by James Weinstein, a lifelong socialist. It investigates alleged corporate and government wrongdoing, covers international affairs, and has a cultural section. It regularly reports on labor, economic and racial justice movements, environmental issues, feminism, grassroots democracy, minority communities, and the media.

Weinstein was the publication&#x27;s founding editor and publisher; its current publisher is Christopher Hass. , it had a circulation of over 50,000. As a nonprofit organization, the magazine is financed through subscriptions and donations.

==History==
In 1976, Weinstein, a historian and former editor of &quot;Studies on the Left&quot;, launched the politically progressive journal &quot;In These Times&quot;. He sought to model the newsweekly on the early-20th-century socialist newspaper the &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;. For some time, its tagline was &#x27;The Socialist Newsweekly&#x27;. &quot;We intend to speak to corporate capitalism as the great issue of our time, and to socialism as the popular movement that will meet it&quot; he told the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; on the eve of the first issue&#x27;s release. While Weinstein himself was involved with both the New American Movement and the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee, he wanted the journal to be independent of any one political party or faction. Thus, over the years it has published a wide variety of contributorsfrom anarchists, to union members, to centrists.

During the 1980s, the publication became well known for its investigative reporting of the Iran–Contra affair. It has since broken stories on the deliberate destruction of Iraqi water treatment plants by US forces during the first Gulf War (1990–1991), global warming, and on the emergence of mad cow disease.

During the 1980s, and up to 1992, it was a biweekly newspaper and a democratic-socialist competitor to the &quot;National Guardian&quot;, which was a biweekly newspaper that was closer to Marxism–Leninism.

Senior editor Silja J. A. Talvi won two National Council on Crime and Delinquency PASS Awards (2005, 2006) for her reporting on the impact of three strikes sentencing on African-American men, and on the trend toward privatization of the prison system.

The magazine was awarded the &quot;Utne Reader&quot; Independent Press Award for Best Political Coverage in 2006.

<text>Thomas Shadwell ( – 19 November 1692) was an English poet and playwright who was appointed Poet Laureate in 1689.

==Life==
Shadwell was born at either Bromehill Farm, Weeting-with-Broomhill or Santon House, Lynford, Norfolk, and educated at Bury St Edmunds School, and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, which he entered in 1656. He left the university without a degree and joined the Middle Temple. At the Whig triumph in 1688, he superseded John Dryden as poet laureate and historiographer royal. He died at Chelsea on 19 November 1692. He was buried in Chelsea Old Church, but his tomb was destroyed by wartime bombing. A memorial to him with a bust by Francis Bird survives in Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey.

He was married to the actress Anne Shadwell, who appeared in several of his plays. They had four children including the playwright Charles Shadwell and John Shadwell, a physician who attended to both Queen Anne and George I.

==Works==
In 1668 he produced a prose comedy, &quot;The Sullen Lovers&quot;, or the &quot;Impertinents&quot;, based on &quot;Les Fâcheux&quot; by Molière, and written in open imitation of Ben Jonson&#x27;s comedy of humours. His best plays are &quot;Epsom Wells&quot; (1672), for which Sir Charles Sedley wrote a prologue, and &quot;The Squire of Alsatia&quot; (1688). Alsatia was the cant name for the Whitefriars area of London, then a kind of sanctuary for persons liable to arrest, and the play represents, in dialogue full of the local argot, the adventures of a young heir who falls into the hands of the sharpers there.

For fourteen years from the production of his first comedy to his memorable encounter with John Dryden, Shadwell produced a play nearly every year. These productions display a hatred of sham, and a rough but honest moral purpose. Although bawdy, they present a vivid picture of contemporary manners.

Shadwell is chiefly remembered as the unfortunate Mac Flecknoe of Dryden&#x27;s satire, the &quot;last great prophet of tautology&quot;, and the literary son and heir of Richard Flecknoe:
&quot;Shadwell alone, of all my sons, is he

Who stands confirm&#x27;d in full stupidity.

The rest to some faint meaning make pretence,

But Shadwell never deviates into sense.&quot;

Dryden had furnished Shadwell with a prologue to his &quot;True Widow&quot; (1679) and, in spite of momentary differences, the two had been on friendly terms. But when Dryden converted to Catholicism, joined the court party and produced &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot; and &quot;The Medal&quot;, Shadwell became the champion of the Protestants and made a scurrilous attack on Dryden in &quot;The Medal of John Bayes: a Satire against Folly and Knavery&quot; (1682). Dryden immediately retorted in &quot;Mac Flecknoe, or a Satire on the True Blue Protestant Poet, T.S.&quot; (1682), in which Shadwell&#x27;s personal attacks were returned with interest. In 1687, Shadwell attempted to answer these attacks in a version of Juvenal&#x27;s 10th Satire. However, Dryden&#x27;s portrait of Shadwell as Og in the second part of &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot; cut far deeper and has withstood the test of time:
&quot;A monstrous mass of foul corrupted matter,

As all the devils had spew&#x27;d to make the batter.

When wine has given him courage to blaspheme,

He curses God, but God before curst him; [...]

The midwife laid her hand on his thick skull,

With this prophetic blessing-- Be thou dull;

Drink, swear and roar, forbear no lewd delight

Fit for thy bulk, do anything but write&quot;.

Nonetheless, due to the political triumph of the Whig party in 1688, Shadwell superseded his enemy as Poet Laureate and historiographer royal.

His son, Charles Shadwell was also a playwright. A scene from his play &quot;The Stockjobbers&quot; was included as an introduction in Caryl Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Serious Money&quot; (1987).

<text>Elkanah Settle (1 February 1648 – 12 February 1724) was an English poet and playwright.

==Biography==
He was born at Dunstable, and entered Trinity College, Oxford, in 1666, but left without taking a degree. His first tragedy, &quot;Cambyses, King of Persia&quot;, was produced at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in 1667. The success of this play led the Earl of Rochester to encourage the new writer as a rival to John Dryden. Through his influence, Settle&#x27;s &quot;The Empress of Morocco&quot; (1673) was twice performed at Whitehall, and proved a great success. It is said by John Dennis to have been &quot;the first play that was ever sold in England for two shillings, and the first play that was ever printed with cuts.&quot; These illustrations represent scenes in the theatre, and make the book very valuable.

The play was printed with a preface to the Earl of Norwich, in which Settle described with scorn the effusive dedications of other dramatic poets. Dryden was obviously aimed at, and he co-operated with John Crowne and Thomas Shadwell in an abusive pamphlet entitled &quot;Notes and Observations on the Empress of Morocco&quot; (1674), to which Settle replied in &quot;Some Notes and Observations on the Empress of Morocco revised&quot; (1674). In the second part of &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot;, in a passage certainly by Dryden&#x27;s hand, he figures as &quot;Doeg.&quot;

Neglected by the court party, he took an active share in the anti-popish agitation. When this subsided he helped expose Titus Oates, and with the Revolution of 1688, he veered towards the Whig party. Having lost the confidence of both sides, &quot;recanting Settle&quot; abandoned politics for the appointment (1691) of city poet.

From 1700, he initiated what has been called a &quot;successful racket&quot; where he would write occasional poems, typically eulogistic or nuptial verse, have them bound up in notably ostentatious armorial bindings, which he would send to the wealthy person whose arms he used. The economics of the practice are unclear; he may have had them commissioned, or been offering them for sale, or (a subtle distinction) have offered to present them in return for literary patronage in cash or some other form. If the book was returned he would try another patron with a new set of arms, altering personal references as required; where the subject matter was shared (as in a wedding) much of the verse could be recycled from one poem to another, and the scholar F. C. Brown has noticed that as many as two-thirds of the lines in Settle&#x27;s wedding poems are &quot;common to all.&quot; The books were bound for Settle by an unknown binder, whose work is remarkable for being &quot;the only instance in which a particular binder has consistently ornamented a large series of bindings with heraldic designs&quot; outside of Royal binders. The bindings are sufficiently distinctive to be known as &quot;Settle bindings&quot;. More than 100 examples survive, from between 1700 and 1723. In his old age he kept a booth at Bartholomew Fair, where he is said to have played the part of the dragon in a green leather suit devised by himself. He became a poor brother of the Charterhouse, where he died.

Settle is one of the &quot;dunces&quot; in Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Dunciad&quot;, handing over his authority to Lewis Theobald and in the 1742 edition Colley Cibber. Settle appears in Boswell&#x27;s life of Dr Johnson, when John Wilkes ascribes the poet&#x27;s obscurity to his &#x27;queer&#x27; name.

==Selected works==
Settle&#x27;s numerous works include, beside numerous political pamphlets and occasional poems:
* &quot;Love and Revenge&quot; (1674), a tragedy
* &quot;Pastor Fido&quot; (1676), a tragicomedy
*&quot;Ibrahim, the Illustrious Bassa&quot; (1676), a tragedy taken from Madeleine de Scudéry&#x27;s romance
*&quot;The Female Prelate&quot; (1680), a tragedy
* &quot;Fatal Love&quot; (1680), a tragedy
* &quot;Distressed Innocence&quot; (1690), a tragedy
* &quot; The New Athenian Comedy&quot; (1693), a satirical comedy written about The Athenian Society
*&quot;The Ambitious Slave&quot; (1694), a tragedy
*&quot;The World in the Moon&quot; (1697), an opera inspired by Francis Godwin&#x27;s &quot;The Man in the Moone&quot;, of which the first scene was formed by a moon fourteen feet across
*&quot;The Virgin Prophetess, or The Fate of Troy&quot; (1701), an opera
* &quot;The City Ramble&quot; (1701), a comedy

==Elkanah Settle in the 21st century==

Shortly before the Scottish Referendum in September 2014, a copy of Settle&#x27;s &quot;Carmen Irenicum: The Union of the Imperial Crowns of Great Britain&quot;, a poem supporting the union of England and Scotland that is dedicated to the monarch Queen Anne, went on sale for £3,250. In 2015, it was reported that the Wetherspoons pub in Dunstable was going to be called &quot;The Elkanah Settle&quot;, until it was realised that the Hollywood actor Gary Cooper also had a connection with the town (he attended the local grammar school), so the tavern was named &quot;The Gary Cooper&quot; instead.

<text>Brumstead (or Brunstead) is a village and a civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. 

The village is located north-west of Stalham and north-east of Norwich. The village is locally known as Brunstead, as depicting on the village sign. 

==History==
Brumstead&#x27;s name is of Anglo-Saxon origin and derives from the Old English for broom steading.

In the Domesday Book, Brumstead is recorded as a settlement of 21 households in the hundred of Happing. In 1086, the village was part of the estates of Roger Bigod.

Listed buildings within Brumstead include Brumstead Grange (Seventeenth Century) and Brumstead Hall (Fifteenth Century) with two Eighteenth Century barns.

During the early phases of the Second World War, an anti-aircraft position was built in Brumstead Parish, but it was later abandoned.

==Geography==
The parish had in 2001 census, a population of 84. At the 2011 census the population remained less than 100 and was included in the civil parish of East Ruston.

The B1159, Cromer and Caister-on-Sea, bisects the parish.

The nearest railway station is at North Walsham for the Bittern Line which runs between Cromer and Norwich. The nearest airport is Norwich.

Brumstead&#x27;s parish church is dedicated to Saint Peter and dates from the Fourteenth Century. St. Peter&#x27;s is located on &#x27;The Avenue&#x27; and has been Grade II listed 1955. The church was restored twice in the Nineteenth Century: once in the 1830s and again in the 1870s. The church boasts a Fourteenth Century font and stained-glass designed by J. &amp; J. King, depicting Saint Peter and Saint John the Baptist.

Within St. Peter&#x27;s Churchyard, there is an early-Eighteenth Century headstone with a skull &amp; crossbones carving as well as a headstone dedicated to Mary Cubett.

<doc id="304351" wikidata="Q3181297" url="?curid=304351" title="John Crowne">
<text>John Crowne (6 April 1641 – 1712) was a British dramatist.

His father &quot;Colonel&quot; William Crowne, accompanied the earl of Arundel on a diplomatic mission to Vienna in 1637, and wrote an account of his journey. He emigrated to Nova Scotia where he received a grant of land from Cromwell, but the French took possession of his property, and the home government did nothing to uphold his rights.

==Biography==
He was born in London on 6 April 1641, and emigrated to Nova Scotia in 1657 with his father, a joint proprietor of the colony, aboard the ship &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, and studied at Harvard College. While studying at Harvard, Crowne lived with Puritan divine John Norton. Crowne left without graduating, however, and returned to England with his father in 1660.

When the son came to England his poverty compelled him to act as gentleman usher to an independent lady of quality, and his enemies asserted that his father had been an Independent minister. He began his literary career with a romance, &quot;Pandion and Amphigenia, or the History of the coy Lady of Thessalia&quot; (1665). In 1671 he produced a romantic play, &quot;Juliana, or the Princess of Poland&quot;, which has, in spite of its title, no pretensions to rank as a historical drama.

The earl of Rochester procured for him, apparently with the sole object of annoying Dryden by infringing on his rights as poet-laureate, a commission to supply a masque for performance at court. &quot;Calisto&quot; gained him the favour of Charles II, but Rochester proved a fickle patron, and his favour was completely alienated by the success of Crowne&#x27;s heroic play in two parts, &quot;The Destruction of Jerusalem by Titus Vespasian&quot; (1677). This piece contained a thinly disguised satire on the Puritan party in the description of the Pharisees, and about 1683 he produced a distinctly political play, &quot;City Politiques&quot;, satirizing the Whig party and containing characters which were readily recognized as portraits of Titus Oates and others. This made him many enemies, and he petitioned the king for a small place that would release him from the necessity of writing for the stage.

The king exacted one more comedy, which should, he suggested, he based on the &quot;No puede ser guardar una mujer&quot; of Moreto. This had already been unsuccessfully adapted, as Crowne discovered later, by Sir Thomas St Serfe, but in Crowne&#x27;s hands it developed into &quot;Sir Courtly Nice&quot; (1685), a comedy which kept its place as a stock piece for nearly a century. Unfortunately Charles II died before the play was completed, and Crowne was disappointed of his reward. In 1698, Princess Anne attended a performance of his play &quot;Caligula&quot; during which Mary Lindsey sang a special composition by Richard Leveridge. Crowne continued to write plays, and it is stated that he was still living in 1703. According to an article in the Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine John was still alive in the first decade of the 18th century when the writer recalls drinking with him. Letters to the royal household indicates he relied on the charity of Queen Mary II and Queen Anne who remembered performing one of his plays for Charles II when they were young princesses.

Crowne was a fertile writer of plays with an historical setting, in which heroic love was, in the fashion of the French romances, made the leading motive. The prosaic level of his style saved him as a rule from the rant to be found in so many contemporary heroic plays, but these pieces are of no particular interest. He was much more successful in comedy of the kind that depicts &quot;humours&quot;.

Little is known of Crowne&#x27;s later life although records show an Elias Crowne (birthplace listed as outside the county) marrying in Norfolk in the late 1680s, the son of a John and Sarah Crowne. There was also a John Crown born in 1667 in London.

Crowne died around 1712 and was buried at St Giles in the Fields, London.

==Works==

* &quot;Charles VIII of France&quot; (1671) was dedicated to Rochester. In &quot;Timon&quot;, generally supposed to have been written by the earl, a line from this piece—&quot;whilst sporting waves smil&#x27;d on the rising sun&quot;—was held up to ridicule
* &quot;Juliana&quot; (1671), a tragedy
* &quot;The Country Wit&quot; (acted 1675, pr. 1693), a comedy derived in part from Molière&#x27;s &quot;Le Sicilien, ou l&#x27;Amour peintre&quot;, is remembered for the leading character, Sir Mannerly Shallow
*&quot;The Ambitious Statesman, or The Loyal Favourite&quot; (1679), one of the most extravagant of his heroic efforts, deals with the history of Bernard d&#x27;Armagnac, Constable of France, after the battle of Agincourt
*&quot;Thyestes, A Tragedy&quot; (1681), spares none of the horrors of the Senecan tragedy, although an incongruous love story is interpolated

*&quot;City Politiques&quot; (1683), a comedy
*&quot;Sir Courtly Nice&quot; (1685), a comedy 
*&quot;Darius, King of Persia&quot; (1688), a tragedy
*&quot;Regulus&quot; (acted 1692, pr. 1694)
*&quot;The English Frier; or The Town Sparks&quot; (acted 1689, pr. 1690), perhaps suggested by Molière&#x27;s &quot;Tartuffe&quot;, ridicules the court Catholics, and in Father Finical caricatures Father Edward Petre.
*&quot;The Married Beau&quot; (1694), is based on the &quot;Curioso Impertinente&quot; in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.
*&quot;Caligula&quot; (1698)
He also produced a version of Racine&#x27;s &quot;Andromaque&quot;, and an unsuccessful comedy, &quot;Justice Busy&quot;.

<doc id="304352" wikidata="Q1270222" url="?curid=304352" title="Foramen ovale (skull)">
<text>The foramen ovale (En: oval window) is a hole in the posterior part of the sphenoid bone, posterolateral to the foramen rotundum. It is one of the larger of the several holes (the foramina) in the skull. It transmits the mandibular nerve, a branch of the trigeminal nerve.

== Structure ==
The foramen ovale is an opening in the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The foramen ovale is one of two cranial foramina in the greater wing, the other being the foramen spinosum. The foramen ovale is posterolateral to the foramen rotundum and anteromedial to the foramen spinosum. Posterior and medial to the foramen is the opening for the carotid canal. 

=== Contents ===
The following structures pass through foramen ovale: 
* mandibular nerve (CN V) (a branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V))
*accessory meningeal artery
*lesser petrosal nerve (a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve)
* an emissary vein connecting the cavernous sinus with the pterygoid plexus
* (occasionally) meningeal branch of the mandibular nerve

=== Variation ===
In a study conducted on 100 skulls, the foramen ovale was divided into 2 or 3 components in 4.5% of the cases. The borders of the foramen in some skulls were also irregular and rough. This may suggest, based on radiological images, the presence of morbid changes, which might be the sole anatomical variation in the foramina ovalia of humans.

In newborn, the foramen ovale is about 3.85 mm and in the adults about 7.2 mm in length. The average maximal length is about 7.48 mm and its average minimal length is 4.17 mm in the adult. The width extends from 1.81 mm in the newborn to 3.7 mm in adults.

=== Development ===
Similar to other foramina, the foramen ovale differs in shape and size throughout life. In a study using over 350 skulls, the earliest perfect ring-shaped formation of the foramen ovale was observed in the 7th month of fetal life, and the latest in 3 years after birth.

== Clinical significance ==
The foramen ovale is used as the entry point into the skull when conducting a Percutaneous Rhizotomy using either radio-frequency ablation, balloon compression or glycerol injection. These are performed to treat trigeminal neuralgia. In the procedure, the electrode is introduced through the cheek of an anesthetized patient and radiologically guided into the foramen ovale, with the intention of partially or fully ablating one or more of the divisions (typically the Mandibular) to relieve pain.

This entry point is also used to surgically place local electrodes directly on the surface of the mesial temporal lobe, in order to observe neural activity of patients with suspected focal epilepsy.

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;foramen ovale&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;oval hole / window&quot;.
