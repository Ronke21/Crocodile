<text>Jonathan David Larson (February 4, 1960 – January 25, 1996) was an American composer, lyricist and playwright, most famous for writing the musicals &quot;Rent&quot; and &quot;Tick, Tick... Boom!&quot;, which explored the social issues of multiculturalism, substance use disorder, and homophobia. 

Larson had worked on both musicals throughout the late 1980s and into the 1990s. After several years of workshopping, &quot;Rent&quot; began an Off-Broadway run in early 1996, though Larson died from an aortic dissection the day before its first preview performance. The show went on to enjoy critical and commercial success, and transferred to Broadway that April, one of the longest-running Broadway productions. Larson posthumously received three Tony Awards and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. &quot;Rent&quot; was also adapted into a 2005 film. &quot;Tick, Tick... Boom!&quot; received an Off-Broadway production in 2001, and was also adapted into a 2021 film.

==Early years==
Jonathan David Larson was born on February 4, 1960, in Mount Vernon, New York, to Nanette née Notarius (1927–2018) and Allan Larson (1925–2021) of White Plains, New York. His family was Jewish. His grandfather, Bernard Isaac Lazarson, who was born in Russia, changed the family surname from Lazarson. At an early age, Larson played the trumpet and tuba, sang in his school&#x27;s choir, and took piano lessons. His early musical influences and his favorite rock musicians included Elton John, The Doors, The Who, and Billy Joel, as well as the classic composers of musical theatre, especially Stephen Sondheim. He also loved Pete Townshend, The Police, Prince, Liz Phair, and The Beatles. Larson attended White Plains High School, where he was also involved in acting, performing in lead roles in various productions, graduating in 1978. He had a sister, Julie.

Larson attended Adelphi University in Garden City, New York, with a four-year scholarship as an acting major, in addition to performing in numerous plays and musical theatre, graduating in 1982 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. Larson stopped acting to focus on compositions. During his college years, he began music composition, composing music first for small student productions, called cabarets, and later the score to a musical entitled &quot;The Book of Good Love&quot; (&quot;Libro de Buen Amor&quot;), written by the department head, Jacques Burdick, who was also Larson&#x27;s college mentor.

As a student at Adelphi University, Larson co-wrote &quot;Sacrimmoralinority,&quot; a Brechtian-themed cabaret musical and his first musical, with David Glenn Armstrong. It was first staged at Adelphi University in the winter of 1981. After Larson and Armstrong graduated in 1982, they renamed it &quot;Saved! - An Immoral Musical on the Moral Majority.&quot; It played a four-week showcase run at Rusty&#x27;s Storefront Blitz, a small theatre on 42nd Street in New York, Manhattan, and won both authors a writing award from ASCAP.

After graduating, Larson participated in a summer stock theatre program at the Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan, as a piano player, which resulted in his earning an Equity card for membership in the Actors&#x27; Equity Association.

==Works==
===&quot;Superbia&quot;===

In 1983, Larson planned to write a musical adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s book &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, which he planned to get produced in the year 1984; however, the Orwell estate denied him permission. Larson then began the process of adapting his work on 1984 into a futuristic story of his own, titled &quot;Superbia&quot;.

&quot;Superbia&quot; was modified many times. In the first drafts, the story, set in the year 2064, followed the character Josh Out, a member of OUTLAND, a society where emotions are erased from everyone at birth. Due to complications at birth, Josh maintained his emotions, and spent his life as an inventor, searching for something that could wake up the rest of his family and society. One day, Josh discovers a Music Box, which has the power to bring emotions to the other members of OUTLAND. He meets Elizabeth In, a girl his age from INCITY, who convinces him to spread the power of the music box. Josh travels to INCITY, where the INs live. The INs are the celebrities of this society who spend their days having their scripted lives filmed and transmitted to the OUTs as entertainment. In INCITY, Josh must face the temptations of fame in order to succeed on his mission. By the time Larson finished his final draft of the show, it was a much darker piece that took a deeper look into the power of emotions and mankind&#x27;s attachment to technology. In this version, Josh was already married to Elizabeth at the beginning of the story and they are both OUTs. Like the other OUTs, Elizabeth is addicted to technology, and is unable to truly love. As the story begins, Josh leaves Elizabeth in order to find a greater life. Elizabeth wakes up from her technological trance and pursues Josh.

&quot;Superbia&quot; won the Richard Rodgers Production Award and the Richard Rodgers Development Grant. However, despite performances at Playwrights Horizons and a rock concert version produced by Larson&#x27;s close friend and producer Victoria Leacock at the Village Gate in September 1989, &quot;Superbia&quot; never received a full production.

In the 2001 three-person musical version of Larson&#x27;s monologue TICK, TICK... BOOM, the 11 o&#x27;clock number from the Musical Comedy version of Superbia, &quot;Come to your Senses&quot; was included. Another song from &quot;Superbia&quot; (&quot;LCD Readout&quot;) was included on the 2007 album &quot;Jonathan Sings Larson&quot;. In 2019, the song &quot;One of these Days&quot;, originally sung by Josh near the beginning of the early drafts of &quot;Superbia&quot;, was included on the album &quot;The Jonathan Larson Project&quot;.

On February 4, 2022, &quot;Sextet Montage&quot; was released on streaming platforms as a single.

===&quot;Tick, Tick... Boom!&quot;===

His next work, completed in 1991, was an autobiographical &quot;rock monologue&quot; entitled &quot;30/90&quot;, which was later renamed &quot;Boho Days&quot; and finally titled &quot;Tick, Tick... Boom!&quot; This piece, written for only Larson with a piano and rock band, drew on his feelings of rejection caused by the disappointment of &quot;Superbia&quot;. The show was performed off-Broadway at the Village Gate in Greenwich Village, then at the Second Stage Theater on the Upper West Side. Both of these productions were produced by Victoria Leacock. The producer Jeffrey Seller saw a reading of &quot;Boho Days&quot; and expressed interest in producing Larson&#x27;s musicals. After Larson&#x27;s death, the work was reworked into a stage musical by playwright David Auburn and arranger and musical director Stephen Oremus. The stage version premiered off-Broadway in 2001 and starred Raúl Esparza as Larson, a performance for which he earned an Obie Award. It has since been produced on a West End theatre. A film adaptation of &quot;tick, tick... BOOM!&quot;, directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda and starring Andrew Garfield (in an Academy Award nominated performance) as Larson, with a rewritten script by Steven Levenson was released on Netflix on November 12, 2021.

In 1992, Larson collaborated with fellow composer/lyricists Rusty Magee, Bob Golden, Paul Scott Goodman, and Jeremy Roberts on &quot;Sacred Cows,&quot; which was devised and pitched to television networks as a weekly anthology with each episode taking a different Biblical or mythological story and giving it a &#x27;90s celebrity twist. The project was shelved due to scheduling conflicts among the five composers but resurfaced over 20 years later in a six-page &quot;Playbill&quot; article. The demo for &quot;Sacred Cows&quot; was released on iTunes.

Larson&#x27;s strongest musical theatre influence was Stephen Sondheim, with whom he corresponded, and to whom he occasionally submitted his work for review. One &quot;tick, tick... BOOM!&quot; song, called &quot;Sunday,&quot; is a homage to Sondheim, who supported Larson, staying close to the melody and lyrics of Sondheim&#x27;s own song of the same title but turning it from a manifesto about art into a waiter&#x27;s lament. Sondheim wrote several letters of recommendation for Larson to various producers. Larson later won the Stephen Sondheim Award.

In addition to his three larger theatrical pieces written before &quot;Rent&quot;, Larson also wrote music for &quot;J.P. Morgan Saves the Nation&quot;; numerous individual numbers; music for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;; music for the children&#x27;s book cassettes of &quot;An American Tail&quot; and &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;; music for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine publisher Jann Wenner; a musical called &quot;Mowgli&quot;; and four songs for the children&#x27;s video &quot;Away We Go!&quot;, which he also conceived with collaborator and composer Bob Golden and directed. He performed in John MacLachlan Gray&#x27;s musical &quot;Billy Bishop Goes to War&quot;, which starred his close friend actor Roger Bart. For his early works, Larson won a grant and award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and the Gilman &amp; Gonzalez-Falla Theatre Foundation&#x27;s Commendation Award.

===&quot;Rent&quot;===
In 1988, playwright Billy Aronson wanted to create &quot;a musical inspired by Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;, in which the luscious splendor of Puccini&#x27;s world would be replaced with the coarseness and noise of modern New York&quot;.

In 1989, Aronson called Ira Weitzman, asking for ideas for collaborators, and Weitzman introduced Larson to Aronson to collaborate on the new project. Larson came up with the title and suggested moving the setting from the Upper West Side to Lower Manhattan, where Larson and his roommates lived in a rundown apartment.

&quot;Rent&quot; started as a staged reading in 1993 at the New York Theatre Workshop, followed by a studio production that played a three-week run a year later. However, the version that is now known worldwide, the result of three years of collaboration and editing between Larson and the producers and director, was not publicly performed before Larson&#x27;s death as Larson died the day before the first preview performance. The show premiered Off-Broadway on schedule. According to lead performer Anthony Rapp, Larson&#x27;s parents, who were flying in for the show anyway, gave their blessing to perform the show despite Larson&#x27;s death a day earlier, and the cast agreed that they would premiere the show by simply singing it through, all the while sitting at three prop tables lined up on stage. But by the time the show got to its high energy &quot;La Vie Boheme&quot;, the cast could no longer contain themselves and did the rest of the show as it was meant to be, minus costumes, to the crowd and the Larson family&#x27;s approval. Once the show was over, there was a long applause followed by silence which was eventually broken when an audience member shouted out &quot;Thank you, Jonathan Larson.&quot;

&quot;Rent&quot; played through its planned engagement to sold-out crowds and was continually extended. The decision was finally made to move the show to a Broadway theatre, and it opened at the Nederlander Theatre on April 29, 1996. In addition to the New York Theatre Workshop, &quot;Rent&quot; was produced by Jeffrey Seller, who was introduced to Larson&#x27;s work when attending an off-Broadway performance of &quot;Boho Days&quot;, and two of his producer friends who also wished to support the work, Kevin McCollum and Allan S. Gordon.

For his work on &quot;Rent&quot;, Larson was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, the Tony Award for Best Musical, Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical, and Tony Award for Best Original Score; the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book of a Musical, Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Music, and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics; the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Musical; the Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Musical in the Off-Broadway category; and Obie Awards for Outstanding Book, Outstanding Lyrics, and Outstanding Music.

Larson&#x27;s estate was scheduled to earn one-third of the amount earned by &quot;Rent&quot;.

==Death==
In the days preceding &quot;Rent&quot;″s first previews in January 1996, Larson began experiencing pain in his chest and back, fever, dizziness, and shortness of breath. He was assessed at Cabrini Medical Center on January 21 and at St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital on January 23, but doctors found nothing of concern in X-rays or electrocardiograms (EKGs), and variously attributed his symptoms to stress, food poisoning, or a virus; a note from one doctor on an EKG speculated about a possible myocardial infarction, but the matter was not further pursued. Larson continued to complain of severe and persistent pain and discomfort throughout this period.

At around 12:30 a.m. on January 25, 1996, the scheduled day of the first preview performance, Larson returned to his apartment from a production meeting, and collapsed in the kitchen. During the 3 a.m. hour, his body was discovered by his roommate, who called emergency services and attempted CPR. Police arrived and pronounced Larson dead at the scene, aged 35. The cause of death was found to be an aortic dissection. A court found that Larson had been misdiagnosed by doctors at both hospitals he had visited. A medical malpractice lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount. The New York State Department of Health launched an investigation and concluded that it is possible he could have lived if the aortic dissection had been properly diagnosed and treated with cardiac surgery. Cabrini Medical Center and St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital were fined $10,000 and $6,000, respectively. 

Larson may have had an undiagnosed case of Marfan syndrome, which increases the risk of aortic dissection; the possibility was publicly promoted by the National Marfan Foundation to raise awareness about the condition, at the urging of the New York State Health Department.

==Legacy==
&quot;Rent&quot; played on Broadway at the Nederlander Theatre from its debut in April 1996 until September 7, 2008. It is the 11th longest running show in Broadway history. In addition, it has toured throughout the United States, Canada, Brazil, Japan, United Kingdom, Australia, China, Singapore, Philippines, Mexico, Germany, Poland, and throughout Europe, as well as in other locations. A film version of &quot;Rent&quot; was released in 2005.

After his death, Larson&#x27;s family and friends started the Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation to provide monetary grants to artists, especially musical theatre composers and writers, to support their creative work. The Jonathan Larson Grants are now administered by the American Theatre Wing, thanks to an endowment funded by the Foundation and the Larson Family.

His semi-autobiographical musical &quot;Tick, Tick... Boom!&quot; premiered Off-Broadway in May 2001, toured the United States in 2003, and premiered in London in May 2005. The show was later revived in London&#x27;s West End in May 2009 and twice Off-Broadway in June 2014 and October 2016. 

In December 2003, Larson&#x27;s work was given to the Library of Congress. The collection includes numerous musicals, revues, cabarets, pop songs, dance and video projects – both produced and un-produced.

Less than three years after &quot;Rent&quot; closed on Broadway, the show was revived Off-Broadway at Stage 1 of New World Stages just outside the Theater District. The show was directed by Michael Greif, who had directed the original productions. The show began previews on July 14, 2011, and opened August 11, 2011.

From October 9 to 14, 2018, Feinstein&#x27;s/54 Below presented &quot;The Jonathan Larson Project&quot;, a concert of several previously unheard songs by Larson. The show was conceived and directed by Jennifer Ashley Tepper. It starred George Salazar, Lauren Marcus, Andy Mientus, Krysta Rodriguez, and Nick Blaemire. A CD of the show was released by Ghostlight Records in April 2019. A full Off-Broadway version of the project will open at the Orpheum Theatre on March 10, 2025, with previews set to begin February 14.

Jonathan is portrayed by actor Andrew Garfield in the biographical musical drama &quot;Tick, Tick... Boom!&quot; which was released on the streaming service Netflix on November 19, 2021. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with high praise for director Lin-Manuel Miranda’s direction in his directorial debut, score, and musical sequences, and Garfield&#x27;s performance garnering universal acclaim. It was named one of the best films of 2021 by the American Film Institute, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Garfield) at the 79th Golden Globe Awards, with Garfield winning the latter.

===Jonathan Larson Grants===
In memory of Larson, in 1996, the Larson family along with the Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation established an award honoring emerging musical theater writers and composers. In 2008, the American Theatre Wing adopted and continued on the legacy through the Jonathan Larson Grants, an unrestricted cash gift to aid in the creative endeavors of the writers and promote their work. Notable winners of the grant include Dave Malloy, Laurence O&#x27;Keefe, Nell Benjamin, Amanda Green, Joe Iconis, Pasek and Paul, Shaina Taub and Michael R. Jackson.

==Personal life==
In college, Larson dated Victoria Leacock. He also dated a dancer for four years who sometimes left him for other men, though she eventually left him for a woman. These experiences influenced the autobiographical aspects of &quot;Rent&quot;.

Larson lived and died in a loft with no heat on the fourth floor of 508 Greenwich Street, on the corner of Greenwich Street and Spring Street in Lower Manhattan. He lived with various roommates over the years, including Greg Beals, a journalist for &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine and the brother of actress Jennifer Beals. For a while, he and his roommates kept an illegal wood-burning stove because of lack of heat in their building.

From the spring of 1985, when he was 25 years old, until October 21, 1995, when he quit since &quot;Rent&quot; was being produced by the New York Theatre Workshop, Larson worked as a waiter at the Moondance Diner on the weekends and worked on composing and writing musicals during the week. Many people came to the diner to meet Larson. He was involved in writing the employee manual. At the diner, Larson met Jesse L. Martin, who was his waiting trainee and later performed the role of Tom Collins in the original cast of Larson&#x27;s &quot;Rent&quot;.

<text>Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge (October 30, 1864 – November 4, 1953), born Elizabeth Penn Sprague, was an American pianist and patron of music, especially of chamber music.

==Biography==
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge&#x27;s father was a wealthy wholesale dealer in Chicago. She was musically talented and studied piano with Regina Watson, as well as composition with other teachers. She married the physician Frederic Shurtleff Coolidge who died from syphilis contracted from a patient during surgery, leaving her with their only child Albert. Soon after, her parents died as well. Coolidge&#x27;s cousin was Lucy Sprague Mitchell, the founder of Bank Street College of Education. Coolidge provided Mitchell with funds for the founding of the school in 1916.

She inherited a considerable amount of money from her parents and decided to spend it on promotion of chamber music, a mission she continued to carry out until her death at the age of 89 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Due to her husband&#x27;s profession, she also gave financial support to medical institutions.

Coolidge&#x27;s financial resources were not unlimited but through force of personality and conviction she managed to raise the status of chamber music in the United States, where the major interest of composers had previously been in orchestral music, from curiosity to a seminal field of composition. Her devotion to music and generosity to musicians were spurred by her own experience as a performing musician: she appeared as a pianist up to her 80s, accompanying world-renowned instrumentalists.

Coolidge established the Berkshire String Quartet in 1916 and started the Berkshire Music Festival at South Mountain, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, two years later. Out of this grew the Berkshire Symphonic Festival at Tanglewood, which she also supported. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1951.

Elizabeth&#x27;s only son, Albert Sprague Coolidge, graduated from the Harvard University and was a chemical physicist, political activist, and civil libertarian.

== Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Medals ==
In 1932, Coolidge established the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Medal for &quot;eminent services to chamber music.&quot; The medals were initially awarded by the Library of Congress. But, in 1949 — after objections by U.S. Congressmen over the appropriateness of a government body awarding prizes in fine arts and literature to individuals who might harbor dissident views towards the U.S. (re: Ezra Pound and the Bollingen Prize) — the Library of Congress discontinued awarding medals of any kind, including (i) the Bollingen Prize, the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Medal for &quot;eminent services to chamber music, and (iii) three prizes endowed by Lessing Rosenwald in connection with an annual national exhibition of prints.

== Other commissions ==
Coolidge organized an effort in 1916 to build and name a studio at the MacDowell Colony in memory of her piano teacher and friend Regina Watson. In 1945 she commissioned the Paganini Quartet, led by Henri Temianka. The Sprague Memorial Hall at Yale University was also financed by Coolidge.

== Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation ==

Her most innovative and costly endeavor, however, was her partnership with the Library of Congress, resulting in the construction of the 500-seat Coolidge Auditorium, specifically intended for chamber music, in 1924. This was accompanied by the establishment of the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation to organize concerts in that auditorium and to commission new chamber music from both European and American composers, as it continues to do today.

== Support of composers and musical works ==

Coolidge had a reputation for promoting &quot;difficult&quot; modern music (though she declined to support one of the most modern of all composers, Charles Ives). But she never aimed at such a reputation and explained her preferences in music as follows: &quot;My plea for modern music is not that we should like it, nor necessarily that we should even understand it, but that we should exhibit it as a significant human document.&quot; Though American herself, she had no national preferences, and in fact most of her commissions went to European composers. She didn&#x27;t have any urge to specifically promote women composers, either.

She sponsored the 1927 tour of the United States of composer Ottorino Respighi and his wife, the soprano Elsa Respighi. The conclusion of the tour was a program held at the Library of Congress chamber music hall that she had funded, and at that occasion Respighi promised to dedicate his next musical composition to Mrs. Coolidge. That composition turned out to be the , inspired by three Botticelli paintings on display at the Uffizi museum in Florence, Italy. The first performance of the work was at a concert in Vienna at the end of that same year, with the Respighis in attendance.

The most lasting memorial to Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge&#x27;s patronage of music are the compositions which she commissioned from many leading composers of the early 20th century. Among the best-known of those compositions are the following:

* Samuel Barber: &quot;Hermit Songs&quot;, Op. 29
* Béla Bartók: String Quartet No. 5
* Benjamin Britten: String Quartet No. 1
* Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco: &quot;String Quartet No. 1&quot;, Op. 58
* Aaron Copland: &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot;
* Arthur Honegger: &quot;Concerto da camera&quot;
* Gian Francesco Malipiero: First Piano Concerto (1937)
* Gabriel Pierné : &quot;Sonata da Camera pour flûte, violoncelle et piano&quot;
* Francis Poulenc: Flute Sonata
* Sergei Prokofiev: String Quartet No. 1
* Maurice Ravel: &quot;Chansons madécasses&quot;
* Arnold Schoenberg: String Quartet No. 3, String Quartet No. 4
* Igor Stravinsky: &quot;Apollon musagète&quot;
* Anton Webern: String Quartet
* Sir Arthur Bliss: Oboe Quintet
* Ottorino Respighi: &quot;Trittico Botticelliano&quot;

Other composers supported by Coolidge include Ernest Bloch, Frank Bridge, Alfredo Casella, George Enescu, Howard Hanson, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Paul Hindemith, Bohuslav Martinů, Darius Milhaud, Rebecca Helferich Clarke, Cyril Rootham and Albert Roussel.

<doc id="296341" wikidata="Q13426709" url="?curid=296341" title="Suffragan bishop">
<text>A suffragan bishop is a type of bishop in some Christian denominations.

In the Catholic Church, a suffragan bishop leads a diocese within an ecclesiastical province other than the principal diocese, the metropolitan archdiocese; the diocese led by the suffragan is called a suffragan diocese.

In the Anglican Communion, a suffragan bishop is a bishop who is subordinate to a metropolitan bishop or diocesan bishop (bishop ordinary) and so is not normally jurisdictional in their role. Suffragan bishops may be charged by a metropolitan to oversee a suffragan diocese and may be assigned to areas which do not have a cathedral.

==Catholic Church==
In the Catholic Church, a suffragan is a bishop who heads a diocese. His suffragan diocese, however, is part of a larger ecclesiastical province, nominally led by a metropolitan archbishop. The distinction between metropolitans and suffragans is of limited practical importance. Both are diocesan bishops possessing ordinary jurisdiction over their individual sees. The metropolitan has few responsibilities over the suffragans in his province and no direct authority over the faithful outside of his own diocese. However he is competent to conduct pastoral visits and he can perform sacred functions, as if he were a bishop in his own diocese in all churches of the Metropolitan province, but he is first to inform the diocesan bishop if the church is the cathedral.

Bishops who assist diocesan bishops are usually called auxiliary bishops. If the assisting bishop has special faculties (typically the right to succeed the diocesan bishop) he would be called a coadjutor bishop. Since they are not in charge of a suffragan diocese, they are not referred to as &quot;suffragan bishops&quot;.

==Anglican Communion==

In the Anglican churches, the term applies to a bishop who is assigned responsibilities to support a diocesan bishop. For example, the bishop of Jarrow is a suffragan to the diocesan bishop of Durham.

Suffragan bishops in the Anglican Communion are nearly identical in their role to auxiliary bishops in the Roman Catholic Church.

===England===

====History====
English diocesan bishops were commonly assisted by bishops who had been consecrated to sees which were &quot;in partibus infidelium&quot; (titular sees that had in most cases been conquered by Muslims) before the English Reformation. The separation of the English Church from Rome meant that this was no longer possible. The Suffragan Bishops Act 1534 allowed for the creation of new sees to allow these assistant bishops, who were named as suffragan. Before then, the term &quot;suffragan&quot; referred to diocesan bishops in relation to their metropolitan. The first bishops consecrated under that Act were Thomas Manning, bishop of Ipswich, and John Salisbury, bishop of Thetford, on 19 March 1536.

The last Tudor suffragan bishop in post was John Sterne, bishop of Colchester, who died in post in 1607/8. No more suffragans were appointed for more than 250 years, until the consecration of Henry Mackenzie as bishop of Nottingham on 2 February 1870. At that point, the sees of suffragans were still limited to the 26 towns named in the 1534 Act; the Suffragans Nomination Act 1888 allowed the creation of new suffragan sees besides the 26 so named. The appointment of bishops suffragan became much more common thereafter.

====Today====
=====Area bishops=====
Some Church of England suffragan bishops are legally delegated responsibility by the diocesan bishop for a specific geographical &quot;area&quot; within the diocese. Such formal arrangements were piloted by the experimental London scheme in 1970. For example, the Bishop of Colchester is an &quot;area bishop&quot; in the Diocese of Chelmsford. Such &quot;area schemes&quot; are presently found in the dioceses of:
* London (since 1979): Two Cities (overseen by the diocesan), Edmonton, Kensington, Stepney, Willesden.
* Chelmsford (since 1983): Barking, Bradwell, Colchester.
* Oxford (since 1984): Oxford (overseen by the diocesan), Buckingham, Dorchester, Reading.
* Southwark (since 1991): Croydon, Kingston, Woolwich.
* Lichfield (since 1992): Shrewsbury, Stafford, Wolverhampton.
* Leeds (since 2014): Bradford, Huddersfield, Leeds (overseen by the Bishop of Kirkstall), Ripon, Wakefield.

Area schemes have previously existed in Worcester diocese (1993–2002; Worcester (overseen by the diocesan), Dudley), Salisbury diocese (1981–2009; Ramsbury, Sherborne), Lincoln diocese (2010 – 31 January 2013; Grantham, Grimsby) and Chichester diocese (1984–2013; Chichester (overseen by the diocesan), Lewes, Horsham). Other suffragans have or have had informal responsibility for geographical areas (e.g. in Winchester, Peterborough, and York), but these are not referred to as &quot;area bishops&quot;.

=====Suffragan bishops=====

Only the small dioceses of Portsmouth and of Sodor and Man do not have a suffragan bishop. Until 2016/2017, the dioceses of Newcastle and of Leicester each had a stipendiary assistant bishop instead of suffragans, but these have since been replaced with suffragan bishops. The Diocese of Truro has had at some periods an assistant bishop; these have included John Wellington (formerly bishop of Shantung) and Bill Lash, both retired from sees abroad.

=====Provincial episcopal visitors=====

Suffragan bishops in the Church of England who have oversight of parishes and clergy that reject the ministry of priests who are women, usually across a whole province, are known as provincial episcopal visitors (PEVs) (or &quot;flying bishops&quot;). This concession was made in 1992 following the General Synod&#x27;s vote to ordain women to the priesthood. The first PEV was John Gaisford, bishop of Beverley, who was consecrated on 7 March 1994.

===Wales===
An early example of a suffragan can be seen in Wales is Penrydd, established in 1537, when the Welsh dioceses were still within the Church of England. The Bishop of Swansea was a suffragan in the Diocese of St David&#x27;s from 1890 till the erection of the diocese in 1923. Since disestablishment, Thomas Lloyd was suffragan Bishop of Maenan in the Diocese of St Asaph, when the bishop diocesan was also Archbishop of Wales.

===Ireland===
The Church of Ireland has no suffragan bishops, not even in the geographically large dioceses.

===United States===
Suffragan bishops are fairly common in larger dioceses of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America (ECUSA), but usually have no responsibility for a specific geographical part of a diocese. ECUSA is not within the jurisdiction of the English law that requires diocesan and suffragan bishops to be appointed as bishop to a specific place, and so suffragans are not given the title of any particular city within the diocese. For example, Bishop Barbara Harris was titled simply “Suffragan Bishop of Massachusetts”.

&quot;Coadjutor&quot; and &quot;assistant&quot; bishops are different episcopal offices than &quot;suffragan&quot;. A coadjutor is elected by a diocesan convention to become the diocesan bishop (also called &quot;the ordinary&quot;) upon the ordinary&#x27;s retirement. A suffragan is also elected by a convention, but does not automatically succeed the diocesan bishop. However a suffragan&#x27;s office does continue in the diocese until he or she chooses to retire. An &quot;assistant bishop&quot; is appointed by the diocesan bishop, and his or her office ends when the ordinary who appointed her or him leaves office.
===Canada===
Some Anglican Church of Canada suffragan bishops are legally delegated responsibility by the diocesan bishop for a specific geographical &quot;area&quot; within the diocese.
*Toronto: York-Scarborough, York-Credit Valley, Trent-Durham, York-Simcoe.
===Malaysia (Diocese of West Malaysia)===
The Diocese of West Malaysia is divided into two &quot;area dioceses&quot;, each with their own suffragan bishop.

===Acting bishops===
It is common for Anglican suffragan or assistant bishops to serve as acting bishop during a vacancy in the diocesan see (e.g., between the death or retirement of the bishop diocesan and their successor taking post). In order to achieve this, the metropolitan bishop commissions a suffragan/assistant (usually the full-time bishop senior by consecration) who becomes the &quot;episcopal commissary&quot;, but may be referred to by any number of phrases (since the commission is held from the metropolitan archbishop, she may be called &quot;archbishop&#x27;s commissary&quot;; the most usual current term in the Church of England being Acting Bishop of Somewhere). In the Anglican Church of Australia, someone (not always a bishop) acting as diocesan bishop is the administrator of the diocese and a bishop so commissioned is called the bishop administrator.

In 2013, between the retirement of Nigel McCulloch and the confirmation of David Walker as bishop of Manchester, both of that diocese&#x27;s suffragan bishops (Chris Edmondson, bishop of Bolton, and Mark Davies, bishop of Middleton, who were consecrated on the same day, therefore neither had seniority) served as acting bishop co-equally. In 2014–2015, during the vacancy between the episcopates of Paul Butler and Paul Williams, the diocese&#x27;s sole suffragan bishop, Tony Porter, bishop of Sherwood, became acting bishop of Southwell and Nottingham; however, when he resigned the commission due to ill health, Richard Inwood (retired bishop of Bedford and an honorary assistant bishop of the diocese) was commissioned Acting Bishop for a fixed one-year term.

After the death of the seventh and last Earl in 1972, the estate passed to Liverpool City Council, which now manages the remainder of the estate following the sale of approximately half of the grounds. The remaining grounds, Croxteth Park, were at one time a hunting chase of the Molyneux family and are now open to the public.

==History==

The original house was built in about 1575, and has been expanded in several stages in Tudor, Georgian, and Queen Anne styles. The principal front, the west façade, was built in 1702. During this period, a bakery and a brewery were built though during the Victorian era these were demolished. In 1874 a wing was added for visitors to the hall to stay in.

Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, and their children stayed at Croxteth Hall on 9 October 1851 before visiting Liverpool the following day during torrential rain. However, the visit started fine with 700 members of the local gentry being entertained in the Hall grounds.

The Hall and its outbuilding are a Grade II* listed building, as are 3 of the outbuildings; another 15 buildings on the estate are Grade II. The Molyneux family lived at the Hall from the 16th century until 1972, when the last Earl died. His American-born widow Josephine, Countess of Sefton (1903–1980) – once a close friend of the Duchess of Windsor and nicknamed &quot;Foxy&quot; for her abundant auburn hair – continued to spend some time at Croxteth. She became the last member of the Molyneux family to reside in the hall.

When the last Earl died in 1972, a worldwide search was made for an heir to the title but without success. Much of the original estate has since been sold off for development, but approximately remain as a country park, which is open to the public and includes various play facilities for children. The estate also contains the historic Hall itself, open to the public for a small fee, as well as a maintained Victorian walled garden and a working country farm.

The walled garden is home to what remains of the Liverpool Botanics. This is one of the oldest horticultural collections in Britain, founded by William Roscoe in 1802. Amongst the tropical plants is the National Collection of &quot;Dracaena&quot; (dragon trees); there are orchids and the National Collection of &quot;Codiaeum&quot;; pelargoniums and the National Collection of &quot;Solenostemon&quot; (coleus) as well as a rich collection of bromeliads. Liverpool was once world-famous for its orchids as the collection is composed mainly of wild collected species rather than the more usual garden hybrids.

In March 2013, it was announced that a £400,000 programme would be undertaken to restore the damaged Queen Anne wing which was gutted by fire in 1952.

Liverpool City Council announced in 2017 that they were looking for bids from developers to manage the hall and park with the facility costing the council over £1 million a year to run. By January 2018, two bids had been submitted to run the hall and park, one of which planned to use the facility as a luxury hotel, spa and wedding venue. However, by March 2018 the council announced plans to run the facility itself, aiming to develop it into a tourist attraction, hosting concerts, fairs and markets.

The hall had to have urgent structural work undertaken during the summer of 2020 when an engineering report discovered that repairs were needed to chimney breasts, guttering and roof linings, costing around £650,000.

==Future==
Liverpool City Council announced a public consultation in August 2022 as to how the park and hall could be used and generate more revenue. The public were invited to give their views on a number of ideas, including the creation of a pet crematorium, paid parking and the types of events they would like to see held there.

==The park==
The park is listed at Grade II. It also contains Mull Wood, which is part of the Croxteth Local Nature Reserve. In partnership with Lancashire Wildlife Trust, the reserve was doubled in size. This allows people better access to the reserve areas and include new habitats within the reserve. One of the improvements to Mull Wood is the sowing of a Wildflower Meadow, situated near the Old Kennels.

Myerscough College operate their Liverpool campus from part of the Hall, at which they teach 350 full-time students. See Myerscough College Liverpool Homepage

The &quot;Friends of Croxteth Hall and Country Park&quot; support the work of Liverpool&#x27;s major stately home. The Friends hold a variety of fun events to raise funds. Among the things they have paid for are benches, plants, equipment, and horticultural studies.

Each Saturday at 9am the park hosts a free, weekly, timed 5 km parkrun event starting and finishing at the hall.

==Kennels==
The kennels in Croxteth Hall Lane were built in the 1870s and are a Grade II listed building. They were designed by the Chester architect John Douglas for the 4th Earl of Sefton. The kennels are built in red brick with a patterned roof of blue and green slates. The building is in one storey and has three bays; the left two bays consist of the kennels and the bay on the right is higher with a steeper half-hipped roof. There is a tall brick chimney stack. The Kennels are currently occupied and maintained by the Croxteth Park Volunteer Group (founded 2017).

<text>Patricia Mae Giraldo (née Andrzejewski; formerly and still professionally Benatar ; born January 10, 1953) is an American singer and songwriter. In the United States, she has two multi-platinum albums, five platinum albums, and 15 US &quot;Billboard&quot; top 40 singles, while in Canada she had eight straight platinum albums, and she has sold over 36 million albums worldwide. She is also a four-time Grammy Award winner. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in November 2022.

Benatar&#x27;s 1979 debut album, &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, was her breakthrough in North America, especially in Canada where it reached No. 3 on the album chart. Two hit singles from the album were released: &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and &quot;We Live for Love&quot;, the latter written by her lead guitarist and future husband, Neil Giraldo. Her second album, 1980&#x27;s &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;, was her most successful work, peaking at No. 2 in North America and France, being certified 4× and 5× platinum in the US and Canada, respectively. The single &quot;Hit Me with Your Best Shot&quot; reached the top 10 in the US and Canada and is considered to be her signature song. Her third album, &quot;Precious Time&quot; (1981), was another success, topping the US Album Chart and becoming her first top 10 album in Australia. Its single &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; charted highly in the US and Canada. Her next release, &quot;Get Nervous&quot; (1982), sold less well than her previous two albums, but did include the North American hit &quot;Shadows of the Night&quot;.

In 1983, Benatar&#x27;s sound began to move towards more atmospheric pop. The single &quot;Love Is a Battlefield&quot; (1983) was her biggest hit in most countries, reaching No. 1 in the Netherlands, Australia and on the US Rock Tracks chart, and No. 5 on the US Hot 100. The live album it came from, &quot;Live from Earth&quot;, was her biggest seller in Australia, Germany and the Netherlands. In 1984, she released &quot;Tropico&quot; and its lead single &quot;We Belong&quot;, which reached the top 10 in several countries, including No. 5 on the US Hot 100.

Benatar&#x27;s 1985 album, &quot;Seven the Hard Way&quot;, sold less well, but it yielded two singles harking back to the rock vein: &quot;Invincible&quot;, a top 10 hit in North America, and &quot;Sex as a Weapon&quot;. Her follow-up, &quot;Wide Awake in Dreamland&quot; (1988), marked a resurgence in sales in Canada and Australia, and was her biggest hit in the UK. Its rocker, &quot;All Fired Up&quot;, was a significant hit in Canada, Australia and the US. She released four additional albums between 1991 and 2003.

== Early life ==
Pat Benatar was born Patricia Mae Andrzejewski on January 10, 1953, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, New York City. Her mother, Mildred (née Knapp; 1928–2016), was a beautician, and her father, Andrew () Andrzejewski (1926–2009), was a sheet-metal worker. Her father was of Polish descent and her mother was of German, English, and Irish ancestry. Her family moved to North Hamilton Avenue in Lindenhurst, New York, a village in the Long Island town of Babylon.

She trained as a coloratura with plans to attend the Juilliard School, but decided instead to pursue health education at Stony Brook University. At 19, after one year at Stony Brook, she dropped out to marry her first husband, high school sweetheart Dennis Benatar, a U.S. Army draftee who trained at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, then served with the Army Security Agency at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, before being stationed at Fort Lee, Virginia, starting in 1973. She worked as a bank teller near Richmond, Virginia.

== Career ==
=== Career beginnings ===
Benatar quit her job to pursue a singing career after being inspired by a Liza Minnelli concert she saw in Richmond. She had a gig at a Holiday Inn and got a job as a singing waitress at a nightclub named the Roaring Twenties. At the Roaring Twenties, she met and formed a duo with pianist Phil Coxon, which soon expanded to a ten-person lounge band called Coxon&#x27;s Army, a regular at Sam Miller&#x27;s basement club. The band gained in popularity and was the subject of a never-aired PBS special; its bassist Roger Capps was later the original bass player for the Pat Benatar Band. The period also yielded Benatar&#x27;s first single: &quot;Day Gig&quot; (1974), written and produced by Coxon and given a limited local release. Her last significant gig in Richmond was a two-hour performance at Thomas Jefferson High School.

Dennis Benatar was discharged from the Army and the couple moved to New York in May 1975 so she could pursue a singing career. She performed at an amateur night at the comedy club Catch a Rising Star in New York. Her rendition of Judy Garland&#x27;s &quot;Rock-a-Bye Your Baby With a Dixie Melody&quot; earned her a callback by club owner Rick Newman, who then became her manager; she became a regular performer at Catch a Rising Star for the next three years. In late 1975 she landed the part of Zephyr in Harry Chapin&#x27;s futuristic rock musical, &quot;The Zinger&quot;, which ran for a month in 1976 at the Performing Arts Foundation&#x27;s (PAF) Playhouse in Huntington Station, Long Island.

Halloween 1977 proved a pivotal night in her early, spandexed stage persona. She entered a Halloween contest at the Cafe Figaro in Greenwich Village dressed as a character from the film &quot;Cat-Women of the Moon&quot;. Later that evening, she went onstage at Catch a Rising Star still in costume. Between appearances at Catch a Rising Star, she recorded commercial jingles for Pepsi-Cola and a number of regional brands. She headlined New York City&#x27;s Tramps nightclub over four days in spring 1978, where her performance was heard by representatives from several record companies. She was signed to Chrysalis Records by co-founder Terry Ellis the following week. She and Dennis divorced shortly after, although she kept his surname.

=== 1979–1981: &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; and &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot; ===
Benatar&#x27;s debut album, &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, was released in August 1979, but only debuted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart in October, eventually peaking at number 12 in the US in March 1980. Mike Chapman produced three tracks on the album, while engineer Peter Coleman oversaw the rest. In addition, Chapman and his songwriting partner, Nicky Chinn, wrote three songs that appear on the LP: &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; and &quot;If You Think You Know How to Love Me&quot; which were previously recorded by Smokie, and a rearranged version of a song they wrote for Sweet, &quot;No You Don&#x27;t&quot;. The album also featured two songs written by Roger Capps and her; &quot;I Need a Lover&quot;, written by John Mellencamp; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Show&quot;, written by Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson.

The album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in December 1980. Canada became the album&#x27;s most successful market as it certified 4× Platinum there with chart peak of number 3 on the RPM albums chart. While it was a moderate success in Australia, reaching number 25, and very successful in New Zealand, reaching number 8, it barely made the Top 100 in the UK. Unusual for an English-language album, its most successful European market was France where it went to number 20.

&quot;If You Think You Know How to Love Me&quot; was the first single to be released on September 14, 1979. However, it was unsuccessful. Her second single &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; was released on October 26, 1979, and became a sleeper hit, eventually climbing to number 23 in the US, number 16 in Canada and number 14 in New Zealand. It was later listed at No. 72 on VH1&#x27;s list of the Greatest Hard Rock songs of all time. A third single &quot;We Live for Love&quot;, which was written by her future husband Neil Giraldo, was released in February 1980, and became her first Top 10 hit anywhere by reaching number 8 in Canada, while reaching number 27 in the US, number 26 in New Zealand, and number 28 in Australia, her first hit there.

In August 1980, she released her second LP, &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;, featuring her signature song &quot;Hit Me with Your Best Shot&quot; along with the controversial song &quot;Hell Is for Children.&quot; The lyrics of the song discuss things that child abusers tell their victims, such as, &quot;Tell Grandma you fell off the swing.&quot; Benatar was inspired by reading a series of articles in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about child abuse in America. &quot;Hit Me With Your Best Shot&quot; (US number 9) was her first single to break the US Top 10 and sold more than one million copies (Gold status) in the United States. It was also a Top 10 hit in Canada and a moderate hit in Australia, where it reached number 33. The album peaked for five consecutive weeks at number 2 in the US in January 1981 (behind John Lennon&#x27;s and Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Double Fantasy&quot;) and a month later, she won her first Grammy Award for &quot;Best Female Rock Vocal Performance&quot; of 1980 for the album.

Other singles released from &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot; were &quot;Treat Me Right&quot; (US number 18 and Canada number 12) and the Rascals&#x27; cover, &quot;You Better Run&quot; (US number 42 but did not chart in Canada), which was the second music video ever played on MTV, after the Buggles&#x27; &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;. The album also featured a changed-tempo cover of Kate Bush&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Produced by Keith Olsen, &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot; remained on the US album charts for 93 weeks and in the top 10 for more than six months, becoming her first Platinum certification by the RIAA, and was later certified as being 4× Platinum, her biggest selling album in the US. In October 1980, she (along with future husband Neil Giraldo) appeared on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. The album was certified 5× Platinum in Canada, her best selling album in that country, where it peaked at number 2 on the album charts. It was also successful in New Zealand (number 6), France (number 2) and Australia (number 16) but did not chart in the UK.

=== 1982–1983: &quot;Precious Time&quot;, &quot;Get Nervous&quot;, and &quot;Live from Earth&quot; ===
In July 1981, Benatar released her third studio album, &quot;Precious Time&quot;, which became her first album to hit number one on the Billboard 200. In Canada it was certified double Platinum and peaked at number 2 on the album chart. It was also her first to chart in the UK, reaching number 30, and became her biggest success in Australia and New Zealand, reaching number 8 and number 2, respectively, while once again being highly successful in France, peaking at number 3. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; (co-written by band member Scott Sheets), was another hit (US number 17 and number 2 on the new Rock Tracks chart, Canada number 4, Top 30 Australia and New Zealand) and won Benatar her second Grammy Award for &quot;Best Female Rock Vocal Performance&quot; and her third consecutive RIAA certified Platinum album, eventually being certified double Platinum. &quot;Promises in the Dark&quot; (US number 38 and Canada number 31) was also released as a single.

&quot;Get Nervous&quot; was released in 1982, led by a hit single and MTV video, &quot;Shadows of the Night&quot;, which sold well: US Hot 100 number 13 and Rock Tracks chart number 3, Canada number 12, and AUS number 19. The album was another success, reaching number 4 in the US, although it sold less well in most other countries, generally only reaching the Top 20 (Canada number 16), and only reached number 73 in the UK. It was her fourth consecutive RIAA and CRIA Platinum certification, and &quot;Shadows of the Night&quot; garnered Benatar her third Grammy, again for &quot;Best Female Rock Vocal Performance&quot;. The follow-up singles, &quot;Little Too Late&quot; and &quot;Looking for a Stranger&quot;, were also successful in the US, hitting number 20 and number 39 (plus number 4 on the Rock Tracks chart) but did not chart outside the US, even in Canada. The WWII-themed music video for &quot;Shadows of the Night&quot; featured then-unknown actors Judge Reinhold as an American fighter copilot and Bill Paxton as a German radio operator.

By 1983 she had established a reputation for singing about &quot;tough&quot; subject matters, best exemplified by one of the biggest hits of her career, &quot;Love Is a Battlefield&quot; (penned by noted hit songwriter Holly Knight with Mike Chapman), released in December 1983. By then, her sound had mellowed from hard rock to more atmospheric pop and the story-based video clip for &quot;Love Is a Battlefield&quot; was aimed squarely at MTV, even featuring Benatar in a Michael Jackson-inspired group dance number, using Jackson&#x27;s Beat It director Bob Giraldi and choreographer Michael Peters. This new pop/rock direction was a huge commercial success, with the single remaining today as her biggest hit in most countries. This included it peaking at number 5 on the US Hot 100, number 1 for four weeks on the US Rock Tracks chart, number 2 in Canada, number 1 in the Netherlands (for four weeks ending as the number 2 song for the year), her first Top 30 hit there, and at number 1 in Australia for seven consecutive weeks, her first Top 25 hit there, number 3 in West Germany, number 5 in Switzerland, number 6 in New Zealand, and number 17 in the UK, her first Top 50 song there. It was her first song to chart in Switzerland, reaching number 11 there. The song also netted Benatar her fourth consecutive Grammy Award for &quot;Best Female Rock Vocal Performance&quot;.

&quot;Love Is a Battlefield&quot; was one of two studio tracks included on the live album, &quot;Live from Earth&quot;, which was recorded during her sold-out &#x27;Get Nervous&#x27; world tour of America and Europe in 1982 and 1983, the other being &quot;Lipstick Lies&quot;. The album had mixed success in different countries: it peaked at number 2 in Australia, number 12 in New Zealand, number 13 in the US, and became her first hit album in Germany (number 7) and the Netherlands (number 4), but only made the Top 25 in Canada and France, and number 60 in the UK. It became her fifth consecutive RIAA and CRIA Platinum album.

=== 1984–1986: &quot;Tropico&quot; and &quot;Seven the Hard Way&quot; ===
In 1984, Benatar released her fifth studio album, &quot;Tropico&quot;, which, aside from reaching number 7 in New Zealand and number 31 in the UK, was generally a step back in most other countries (US number 14, Canada number 21, AUS number 9, France number 16, Germany number 26, Netherlands number 23). The single &quot;We Belong&quot;, a slow-tempo pop song, released in October 1984, a month prior to the album&#x27;s release, became another top 10 hit in the US peaking at number 5, reaching the Top 10 in several other countries, including number 7 in Australia, number 9 in West Germany, and number 5 in Switzerland, her most successful but last hit single there. It also peaked at number 22 in the UK. A second single release, &quot;Ooh Ooh Song&quot;, reached number 36 in the US, but fared poorly in other countries. She and Giraldo said that this album was the first where they moved away from her famed &quot;hard rock&quot; sound and started experimenting with new, sometimes &quot;gentler&quot;, styles and sounds. Despite not making the US Top 10, the album immediately earned her a sixth consecutive RIAA and CRIA Platinum-certified album.

After the chart success of &quot;We Belong&quot; in the UK, &quot;Love is a Battlefield&quot; was re-released in the UK early 1985 and became her highest chart hit there, reaching number 17. &quot;We Belong&quot; was also nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1986, her first nomination in that category.

In 1985, she released her sixth studio album, &quot;Seven the Hard Way&quot;. She hit the US Top 10 (and number 4 on the US Rock Tracks chart) with the Grammy-nominated rock single &quot;Invincible&quot; (the theme from the movie &quot;The Legend of Billie Jean&quot;), which was written by Holly Knight (Love Is a Battlefield) and Simon Climie, three full months before the album was released. The track also reached number 6 in Canada. Her other Grammy-nominated single from the album, the guitar-driven &quot;Sex As a Weapon&quot;, climbed as high as number 28 on the US Hot 100 in January 1986, number 5 on the US Rock Tracks chart, and reached the Top 30 in Canada. Both the &quot;Seven and the Hard Way&quot; singles were less successful outside North America than the previous two &quot;gentler&quot; singles, generally reaching the Top 30 in Australia, West Germany, the Netherlands, and New Zealand (although &quot;Invincible&quot; went Top 15 there), but missing the Top 50 in the UK. A third single, the mellow &quot;Le Bel Age&quot;, made it to number 54 on the US Hot 100.

&quot;Seven the Hard Way&quot; peaked at number 26 in the US, earning an RIAA Gold certification (import CD). In Canada, it was her seventh consecutive Platinum certified album, even though it only peaked at number 35 on the albums sales chart. It also reached number 19 in Australia and was a big success in New Zealand reaching number 2, but did not reach the Top 50 in West Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland or the UK, and for the first time, an album of hers failed to chart in France. In her autobiography, &quot;Between a Heart and a Rock Place&quot;, she said, &quot;Out of all the albums, &quot;Seven the Hard Way&quot; cost the most to make and sold the least.&quot; The album sold approximately 600,000 US copies.

=== 1987–1988: &quot;Best Shots&quot; and &quot;Wide Awake in Dreamland&quot; ===
In July 1988, Benatar released her seventh studio album, &quot;Wide Awake in Dreamland&quot;, which generally improved on the success of &quot;Seven the Hard Way&quot;, such as peaking at number 11 in the UK and Canada, earning her eighth consecutive Platinum certified album in Canada, and number 13 in Australia. It peaked at number 26 in the US, but stalled at number 15 in New Zealand, usually one of her most successful markets. The Grammy-nominated lead single, &quot;All Fired Up&quot; (written by Kerryn Tolhurst, ex-The Dingoes) reached number 19 in both the U.S. and the UK (plus number 2 on the US Rock Tracks chart), number 8 in Canada, number 20 in New Zealand, and was a number 2 smash in Australia, becoming one of the biggest hits of 1988 in that country. Other singles released from the LP are &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk Away&quot; (UK number 42), the Grammy nominated &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot;, and &quot;One Love&quot; (UK number 59).

=== 1989–2012: &quot;True Love&quot;, &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Innamorata&quot; and &quot;Go&quot; ===

&quot;True Love&quot; was a jump blues record, released in late April 1991, and featured the blues band Roomful of Blues, backing up Pat Benatar, Neil Giraldo and Myron Grombacher. The album sold over 339,000 copies without significant radio airplay and limited exposure on VH-1. &quot;Payin&#x27; the Cost to Be the Boss&quot;, &quot;So Long&quot;, and the title cut were released as singles, with the first reaching number 17 on the US Rock Tracks chart, but not charting anywhere else. The album reached number 40 in the UK and number 37 in the US. It was certified Gold in Canada for sales of 50,000 units, her first to not achieve Platinum status and her last certified album for that country where it peaked at 22 on the albums sales chart. It reached the Top 40 in several other countries.

&quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; was released in 1993 and was a return to the AOR genre. &quot;Everybody Lay Down&quot; was picked up by Album Rock radio and went all the way to number 3 on the Rock Tracks chart. The single was never released to Top 40/Contemporary Hit Radio and a music video was never produced. The only other country where it charted was Canada where it reached number 50. &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Baby&quot; was instead released as the single to Top 40 radio and a music video produced, but it did not chart in the US and was only a minor success in some other countries, including peaking at number 41 in Canada.

A third track, &quot;Everytime I Fall Back&quot;, was scheduled for release and a video was filmed, but the single was never released and the music video was lost when Chrysalis was sold to EMI Records. She had become pregnant again and it may have had an effect on her label&#x27;s support of the album. The tour for this album was only seven dates, cut short because of the pregnancy. It was her last album recorded for Chrysalis. With very little promotion from Chrysalis, &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; failed to have the same commercial success as her previous work. According to SoundScan, the album sold approximately 160,000 copies in the United States and it reached number 85 on the album chart. It is currently available in a two-in-one release with &quot;True Love&quot; (import). The album only charted in one other market – that being Canada – where it reached number 44.

&quot;Innamorata&quot; (US number 171) was released in 1997 on the CMC International record label. A single video was produced for &quot;Strawberry Wine (Life is Sweet)&quot;. According to SoundScan, the album sold close to 65,000 copies.

She has released only one album of new material since 1997&#x27;s &quot;Innamorata&quot;, which is 2003&#x27;s &quot;Go&quot; (US number 187). The album included the 9/11 charity single &quot;Christmas in America&quot; as a bonus track. A video was produced for the single &quot;Have It All&quot;, but was never released until it was leaked on YouTube in 2012; the only video from this album is for the bonus track. They reunited with Holly Knight with Neil and Holly cowriting the tune &quot;Girl&quot;. The hard rock title track &quot;Go!&quot; became a popular performance song for Benatar&#x27;s future concerts. According to SoundScan, the album has now sold nearly 34,000 copies.

=== 2013–present ===
In November 2015 Benatar recorded and released a holiday song called &quot;One December Night&quot;.

In January 2017 she recorded the song &quot;Shine&quot; to support the Women&#x27;s March on January 21, 2017, which was her first original non-holiday recording in over 10 years. In September of the same year she again teamed with songwriter and producer Linda Perry for the song &quot;Dancing Through the Wreckage&quot;, which was the lead single from the soundtrack for the documentary Served Like a Girl. In October 2017 the song entered the Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart, eventually peaking at number 22 in November. The song also received a nomination for Best Song from a Documentary from the Critics&#x27; Choice Awards.

In 2020, she was nominated for induction in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside fifteen other artists but despite coming in second in the fan vote was not among the inductees. She was nominated for a second time in 2022. On May 4, 2022, the Hall of Fame announced Benatar would be included in the 2022 class of inductees.

On July 22, 2022, she announced she would stop performing &quot;Hit Me with Your Best Shot&quot; on her current tour &quot;in deference to the victims of the families of these [recent] mass shootings&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Pat Benatar married her high school sweetheart, Dennis Benatar, at the age of 19 in 1972. The couple divorced in 1979. She has been married to her second husband, guitarist Neil Giraldo, since 1982. They have two daughters and live in Malibu, California. Both her daughters Haley and Hana Giraldo appeared on the E! reality television series &quot;Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive&quot; and &quot;Relatively Famous: Ranch Rules&quot;, in late 2005 and early 2022 respectively.

While Benatar and Giraldo are both Roman Catholic, the two did not marry within the Church, owing to the former&#x27;s divorce. The two were married in Hana, Hawaii, by Rev. Henry Kahula of the nondenominational Wainanalua Church on February 20, 1982, just days before the 24th Grammy Awards.

=== Memoir ===
In June 2010, Benatar&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Between a Heart and a Rock Place&quot;, was released. The book was published by HarperCollins and was acquired by Lisa Sharkey. Benatar&#x27;s memoir touches on her battles with her record company Chrysalis, the difficulties that her career caused in her personal life, and feminism. In the memoir, she is quoted as saying, &quot;For every day since I was old enough to think, I&#x27;ve considered myself a feminist … It&#x27;s empowering to watch and to know that, perhaps in some way, I made the hard path [women] have to walk just a little bit easier.&quot; The book went on to become a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. Initially reluctant to undertake the project, she found the actual writing process so enjoyable that it inspired her with plans to write a novel. In summer 2011, Benatar announced she was working on a Christmas album and a novel about the second coming of Christ.

== Band ==
Although billed as a solo artist, Benatar recorded and toured with a consistent set of band members over most of her career:
* Neil &quot;Spyder&quot; Giraldo (incorrectly spelled as &quot;Geraldo&quot; in early liner notes/credits) is the lead guitarist of the band and has performed on all of Benatar&#x27;s albums.
* Myron Grombacher, who played with Giraldo in Rick Derringer&#x27;s touring band, was the drummer on nine of Benatar&#x27;s original albums (&quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;, &quot;Precious Time&quot;, &quot;Get Nervous&quot;, &quot;Live from Earth&quot;, &quot;Tropico&quot;, &quot;Seven the Hard Way&quot;, &quot;Wide Awake in Dreamland&quot;, &quot;True Love&quot;, and &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;) and has numerous writing credits. Grombacher is easily recognizable in the music videos, particularly as the mad dentist in &quot;Anxiety (Get Nervous)&quot;.
* Charlie Giordano played keyboards on six albums (&quot;Get Nervous&quot;, &quot;Live from Earth&quot;, &quot;Tropico&quot;, &quot;Seven the Hard Way&quot;, &quot;Wide Awake in Dreamland&quot; and &quot;True Love&quot;) and is identifiable by his glasses and berets, blazers, and 1980s ties. In 2007, he replaced the late Danny Federici in the E Street Band.
* Roger Capps, the original bassist for the first five albums (&quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;, &quot;Precious Time&quot;, &quot;Get Nervous&quot;, and &quot;Live from Earth&quot;), co-wrote &quot;Hell Is For Children&quot; with Benatar and Giraldo and left the band in 1984.
*Scott St. Clair Sheets (Scott Sheets) who was originally the lead guitarist of the 1970s band, The Brats, was an original member of the Pat Benatar Band. Sheets is credited as guitarist on the first three albums (&quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;, and &quot;Precious Time&quot;) and first three world tours. He wrote the song &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot; for the &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot; album and co-wrote the hit &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; for the &quot;Precious Time&quot; album. 
* Mick Mahan is the band&#x27;s bassist and has performed with Benatar since 1995 and has appeared on albums (&quot;Innamorata&quot; and &quot;Go&quot;). The original bassist, Roger Capps, was replaced by Donnie Nossov on &quot;Tropico&quot;, and then later by Frank Linx.
* Donnie Nossov was the band&#x27;s second bassist for two of Pat Benatar&#x27;s albums (&quot;Tropico&quot; and &quot;Seven the Hard Way&quot;) 
* Frank Linx was the bassist for two of Pat Benatar&#x27;s studio albums (&quot;Wide Awake in Dreamland&quot; and &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;)
* Glen Alexander Hamilton played drums on the first album (&quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;).
* Chuck Domanico was the band&#x27;s bassist on their eighth studio album and ninth album overall (&quot;True Love&quot;)
* Chris Ralles is the band&#x27;s current drummer.

== Stage and screen appearances ==

* Benatar played the role of Jeanette Florescu in the film &quot;Union City&quot; (1980), directed by Mark Reichert.
* Benatar played the character Zephyr in Harry Chapin&#x27;s futuristic rock musical &quot;The Zinger&quot;. Benatar performed the solo &quot;Shooting Star&quot; in honor of Chapin for the Harry Chapin Tribute, Carnegie Hall, December 7, 1987.
* Benatar has made numerous television appearances, mostly as herself. She appeared with her husband Neil Giraldo in the &quot;Charmed&quot; episode &quot;Lucky Charmed&quot; on which &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; was used and in an episode of &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot; as herself singing &quot;We&#x27;ve Only Just Begun&quot; and &quot;Love Is a Battlefield&quot; at an impromptu wedding in an airport. In 2001, she also appeared as fictional rock star Anna Raines in the CBS television drama &quot;Family Law&quot; with Dixie Carter and Christopher McDonald. Benatar also appeared on &quot;That 80&#x27;s Show&quot; as herself.
* Benatar appeared as a special guest at the sixth annual &quot;VH1 Divas&quot; concert, &quot;VH1 Divas Duets&quot;, performing &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; with Giraldo and headliner Lisa Marie Presley, with the married couple interviewed by Sharon Osbourne following the performance.
* In 2003, Benatar and her music were featured on &quot;CMT Crossroads&quot;, in an episode that paired her with country singer Martina McBride (who was influenced by Benatar&#x27;s vocal range).
* Benatar and Giraldo performed in the Tiny Desk Concerts series of NPR Music on November 14, 2014. At the Tiny Desk, Benatar and Giraldo ran through three of their classic songs: &quot;We Live For Love,&quot; &quot;We Belong&quot; and &quot;Promises In The Dark&quot;.

<text>In telecommunications, ITU-T G.992.1 (better known as G.dmt) is an ITU standard for ADSL using discrete multitone modulation (DMT). G.dmt full-rate ADSL expands the usable bandwidth of existing copper telephone lines, delivering high-speed data communications at rates up to 8 Mbit/s downstream and 1.3 Mbit/s upstream.

DMT allocates from 2 to 15 bits per channel (bin). As line conditions change, bit swapping allows the modem to swap bits around different channels, without retraining, as each channel becomes more or less capable. If bit swapping is disabled then this does not happen and the modem needs to retrain in order to adapt to changing line conditions.

There are 2 competing standards for DMT ADSL - ANSI and G.dmt; ANSI T1.413 is a North American standard, G.992.1 (G.dmt) is an ITU (United Nations Telecom committee) standard. G.dmt is used most commonly today, throughout the world, but the ANSI standard was formerly popular in North America. There is a difference in framing between the two, and selecting the wrong standard can cause frame alignment errors every 5 or so minutes. Error correction is done using Reed–Solomon encoding and further protection can be used if Trellis encoding is used at both ends. Interleaving can also increase the robustness of the line but increases latency.

==DMT history and line rates==

Modulation is the overlaying of information (or the signal) onto an electronic or optical carrier waveform. There are two competing and incompatible standards for modulating the ADSL signal, known as discrete multitone modulation (DMT) and Carrierless Amplitude Phase (CAP). CAP was the original technology used for DSL deployments, but the most widely used method now is DMT.

The graphs on the right summarise the speeds obtainable for each ADSL standard based on line length and attenuation. The is of more importance since it is attenuation which is the governing factor for line speed because attenuation rate over distance can vary significantly between various copper lines due to their quality and other factors. ADSL2 is able to extend the reach of extremely long lines that have around 90 dB attenuation. Standard ADSL is only able to provide a service on lines with an attenuation no greater than about 75 dB.

==DMT technical details==

===Bins (carrier channels)===
Discrete Multi-Tone (DMT), the most widely used modulation method, separates the ADSL signal into 255 carriers (bins) centred on multiples of 4.3125 kHz. DMT has 224 downstream frequency bins and up to 31 upstream bins. Bin 0 is at DC and is not used. When voice (POTS) is used on the same line, then bin 7 is the lowest bin used for ADSL.

The centre frequency of bin N is (N x 4.3125) kHz. The spectrum of each bin overlaps that of its neighbours: it is not confined to a 4.3125 kHz wide channel. The orthogonality of COFDM makes this possible without interference.

Up to 15 bits per symbol can be encoded in a bin on a good quality line.

The frequency layout can be summarised as:
* 30 Hz-4 kHz, voice.
* 4–25 kHz, unused guard band.
* 25–138 kHz, 25 upstream bins (7-31).
* 138–1104 kHz, 224 downstream bins (32-255).

Typically, a few bins around 31-32 are not used in order to prevent interference between upstream and downstream bins either side of 138 kHz. These unused bins constitute a guard band to be chosen by each DSLAM manufacturer - it is not defined by the G.992.1 specification.

===Coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (COFDM)===
The use of bins produces a transmission system known as coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (COFDM). In the context of G.992.1, the term &quot;Discrete Multi-Tone&quot; (DMT) is used instead, hence the alternative name of the standard, G.dmt.
Using DMT is useful since it allows the communications equipment (user modem/router and exchange/DSLAM) to select only bins which are usable on the line thus effectively obtaining the best overall bit rate from the line at any given moment in time. With COFDM, a combined signal containing many frequencies (for each bin) is transmitted down the line. Fast Fourier Transform (and the inverse iFFT) is used to convert the signal on the line into the individual bins.

===Reducing bit errors with QAM or PSK===

A type of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) or phase-shift keying (PSK) is used to encode the bits within each bin. This is a complex and mathematical subject and will not be discussed further here. However, much research has been done on these modulation techniques and they are used for transmission because they allow the SNR to be improved, thus lowering the noise floor and enabling more reliable transmission of a signal with fewer errors. The gain obtainable above the noise floor can be anything from 0.5 to 1.5 dB and these small amounts make a vast difference when sending signals over long distance copper lines of 6 km or more.

===Bin quality and bit rate===
The quality of the line (how well it performs) at the frequency of the bin in question determines how many bits can be encoded within that bin. As with all transmission lines, it depends on the attenuation and signal-to-noise ratio.

SNR may differ for each bin and this plays an important factor for deciding how many bits can be encoded reliably on it. Generally speaking, 1 bit can be encoded reliably for each 3 dB of available dynamic range above the noise floor within a transmission medium so, for example, a bin with an SNR of 18 dB would be able to accommodate 6 bits.

===Echo cancellation===
Echo cancellation can be used so the downstream channel overlaps the upstream channel, or vice versa, meaning simultaneous upstream and downstream signals are sent. Echo cancellation is optional and is typically not used.

==DMT bits-per-bin examples==
Below are examples of how the bin layout may look on various ADSL modems. Both show similar information and in each example there are 256 bins with a varied number of bits being encoded on each one. We can see that at around the frequency range of bin 33, the SNR is 40 dB with the bits per bin being around 6 or 7.

==Summary==
* DMT uses &quot;COFDM&quot; to create &quot;256 bins&quot; (carrier channels) using frequencies above voice on the line.
* The frequency layout can be summarised as:
** 0–4 kHz, voice.
** 4–25 kHz, unused guard band.
** 25–138 kHz, 25 upstream bins (7–31).
** 138–1104 kHz, 224 downstream bins (32–255).
* Bin N is centered on a frequency of &quot;N × 4.3125&quot; kHz.
* The bandwidth used by each bin overlaps neighbouring bins.
* The number of &quot;bits encoded&quot; on each bin is &quot;between 2 and 15&quot;, depending on the &quot;signal to noise ratio&quot; (SNR) for that bin.
* For each 3 dB of SNR within a bin, 1 bit can be encoded reliably.
* Too many errors that cannot be corrected by the built in error correction would lead to the end user modem/router losing sync with the remote exchange (DSLAM or MSAN).
* &quot;Echo cancellation&quot; can be used on the lower frequency (upstream) bins to allow &quot;all 256 bins&quot; to be used for downstream.

==ADSL statistics==
Figures in brackets have been shown to provide a stable service in practice.
* Attenuation - How much signal is lost on the line (should be &lt;56 dB downstream, &lt;37 dB upstream)
* Noise margin - 12 dB or higher, for both downstream and upstream
* Attainable bit rates - Maximum speed line is capable of supporting
* DMT bits per bin - Shows which channels are in use
* CV - Coding violations
* ES - Errored Seconds - number of seconds that have had CRC errors
* Relative capacity occupation (RCO) - Percentage of the attainable line bit rate that is in use. This takes into account interference on the line and the target noise margin at the remote DSLAM.
* SES - Severely Errored Seconds - after 10 seconds of ES we start counting SES
* UAS - Unavailable Seconds - Seconds where we had no sync
* LOS - Loss of Sync
* LPR - Loss of CPE power
* LOF - Loss of Framing - DSL frames don&#x27;t line up

<text>In cryptography, X.509 is an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard defining the format of public key certificates. X.509 certificates are used in many Internet protocols, including TLS/SSL, which is the basis for HTTPS, the secure protocol for browsing the web. They are also used in offline applications, like electronic signatures.

An X.509 certificate binds an identity to a public key using a digital signature. A certificate contains an identity (a hostname, or an organization, or an individual) and a public key (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, ed25519, etc.), and is either signed by a certificate authority or is self-signed. When a certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority, or validated by other means, someone holding that certificate can use the public key it contains to establish secure communications with another party, or validate documents digitally signed by the corresponding private key.

X.509 also defines certificate revocation lists, which are a means to distribute information about certificates that have been deemed invalid by a signing authority, as well as a certification path validation algorithm, which allows for certificates to be signed by intermediate CA certificates, which are, in turn, signed by other certificates, eventually reaching a trust anchor.

X.509 is defined by the ITU&#x27;s &quot;Standardization Sector&quot; (ITU-T&#x27;s SG17), in ITU-T Study Group 17 and is based on Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), another ITU-T standard.

==History and usage==
X.509 was initially issued on July 3, 1988, and was begun in association with the X.500 standard. The first tasks of it was providing users with secure access to information resources and avoiding a cryptographic man-in-the-middle attack. It assumes a strict hierarchical system of certificate authorities (CAs) for issuing the certificates. This contrasts with web of trust models, like PGP, where anyone (not just special CAs) may sign and thus attest to the validity of others&#x27; key certificates.

Version 3 of X.509 includes the flexibility to support other topologies like bridges and meshes. It can be used in a peer-to-peer, OpenPGP-like web of trust, but was rarely used that way . The X.500 system has only been implemented by sovereign nations for state identity information sharing treaty fulfillment purposes, and the IETF&#x27;s Public-Key Infrastructure (X.509) (PKIX) working group has adapted the standard to the more flexible organization of the Internet. In fact, the term &quot;X.509 certificate&quot; usually refers to the IETF&#x27;s PKIX certificate and CRL profile of the X.509 v3 certificate standard, as specified in , commonly called PKIX for &quot;Public Key Infrastructure (X.509)&quot;.

An early issue with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and X.509 certificates was the well known &quot;which directory&quot; problem. The problem is the client does not know where to fetch missing intermediate certificates because the global X.500 directory never materialized. The problem was mitigated by including all intermediate certificates in a request. For example, early web servers only sent the web server&#x27;s certificate to the client. Clients that lacked an intermediate CA certificate or where to find them failed to build a valid path from the CA to the server&#x27;s certificate. To work around the problem, web servers now send all the intermediate certificates along with the web server&#x27;s certificate.

While PKIX refers to the IETF&#x27;s or Internet&#x27;s PKI standard, there are many other PKIs with different policies. For example, the US Government has its own PKI with its own policies, and the CA/Browser Forum has its own PKI with its own policies. The US Government&#x27;s PKI is a massive book of over 2500 pages. If an organization&#x27;s PKI diverges too much from that of the IETF or CA/Browser Forum, then the organization risks losing interoperability with common tools like web browsers, cURL, and Wget. For example, if a PKI has a policy of only issuing certificates on Monday, then common tools like cURL and Wget will not enforce the policy and allow a certificate issued on a Tuesday.

==Certificates==

X.509 certificates bind an identity to a public key using a digital signature. In the X.509 system, there are two types of certificates. The first is a CA certificate. The second is an end-entity certificate. A CA certificate can issue other certificates. The top level, self-signed CA certificate is sometimes called the Root CA certificate. Other CA certificates are called intermediate CA or subordinate CA certificates. An end-entity certificate identifies the user, like a person, organization or business. An end-entity certificate &quot;cannot&quot; issue other certificates. An end-entity certificate is sometimes called a leaf certificate since no other certificates can be issued below it.

An organization that wants a signed certificate requests one from a CA using a protocol like Certificate Signing Request (CSR), Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) or Certificate Management Protocol (CMP). The organization first generates a key pair, keeping the private key secret and using it to sign the CSR. The CSR contains information identifying the applicant and the applicant&#x27;s public key that is used to verify the signature of the CSR - and the Distinguished Name (DN) that is unique for the person, organization or business. The CSR may be accompanied by other credentials or proofs of identity required by the certificate authority.

The CSR will be validated using a Registration Authority (RA), and then the certification authority will issue a certificate binding a public key to a particular distinguished name. The roles registration authority and certification authority are usually separate business units under separation of duties to reduce the risk of fraud.

An organization&#x27;s trusted root certificates can be distributed to all employees so that they can use the company PKI system. Browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Safari and Chrome come with a predetermined set of root certificates pre-installed, so SSL certificates from major certificate authorities will work instantly; in effect the browsers&#x27; developers determine which CAs are trusted third parties for the browsers&#x27; users. For example, Firefox provides a CSV and/or HTML file containing a list of Included CAs.

X.509 and also include standards for certificate revocation list (CRL) implementations. Another IETF-approved way of checking a certificate&#x27;s validity is the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). Firefox 3.0 enabled OCSP checking by default, as did versions of Windows from at least Vista and later.

===Structure of a certificate===
The structure foreseen by the standards is expressed in a formal language, Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1).

The structure of an X.509 v3 digital certificate is as follows:
* Certificate
**Version Number
**Serial Number
**Signature Algorithm ID
**Issuer Name
**Validity period
***Not Before
***Not After
**Subject name
**Subject Public Key Info
***Public Key Algorithm
***Subject Public Key
**Issuer Unique Identifier (optional)
**Subject Unique Identifier (optional)
**Extensions (optional)
*Certificate Signature Algorithm
*Certificate Signature

The Extensions field, if present, is a sequence of one or more certificate extensions. Each extension has its own unique ID, expressed as object identifier (OID), which is a set of values, together with either a critical or non-critical indication. A certificate-using system must reject the certificate if it encounters a critical extension that it does not recognize, or a critical extension that contains information that it cannot process. A non-critical extension may be ignored if it is not recognized, but must be processed if it is recognized.

The structure of version 1 is given in .

The inner format of issuer and subject unique identifiers specified in &quot;X.520 The Directory: Selected attribute types&quot; recommendation.

ITU-T introduced issuer and subject unique identifiers in version 2 to permit the reuse of issuer or subject name after some time. An example of reuse will be when a CA goes bankrupt and its name is deleted from the country&#x27;s public list. After some time another CA with the same name may register itself, even though it is unrelated to the first one. However, IETF recommends that no issuer and subject names be reused. Therefore, version 2 is not widely deployed in the Internet. 

Extensions were introduced in version 3. A CA can use extensions to issue a certificate only for a specific purpose (e.g. only for signing digital objects).

In all versions, the serial number must be unique for each certificate issued by a specific CA (as mentioned in ).

===Extensions informing a specific usage of a certificate===
 (and its predecessors) defines a number of certificate extensions which indicate how the certificate should be used. Most of them are arcs from the codice_1 OID. Some of the most common, defined in section 4.2.1, are:

* Basic Constraints, codice_2, are used to indicate whether the certificate is a CA certificate and can certify or issue other certificates. A constraint can be marked as critical. If a constraint is marked critical, then an agent must fail to process the certificate if the agent does not understand the constraint. An agent can continue to process a non-critical constraint it does not understand.
* Key Usage, codice_3, provides a bitmap specifying the cryptographic operations which may be performed using the public key contained in the certificate; for example, it could indicate that the key should be used for signatures but not for encipherment.
* Extended Key Usage, codice_4, is used, typically on a leaf certificate, to indicate the purpose of the public key contained in the certificate. It contains a list of OIDs, each of which indicates an allowed use. For example, codice_5 indicates that the key may be used on the server end of a TLS or SSL connection; codice_6 indicates that the key may be used to secure email.

In general when using , if a certificate has several extensions restricting its use, all restrictions must be satisfied for a given use to be appropriate. The RFC gives the specific example of a certificate containing both keyUsage and extendedKeyUsage: in this case, both must be processed and the certificate can only be used if both extensions are coherent in specifying the usage of a certificate. For example, NSS uses both extensions to specify certificate usage.

===Extended Validation certificates===
Certification authorities operating under the CA/Browser Forum&#x27;s PKI issue certificates with varying levels of validation. The different validations provide different levels of assurances that a certificate represents what it is supposed to. For example, a web server can be validated at the lowest level of assurances using an email called &quot;Domain Validation (DV)&quot;. Or a web server can be validated at a higher level of assurances using more detailed methods called &quot;Extended Validation (EV)&quot;. 

In practice, a DV certificate means a certificate was issued for a domain like codice_7 after someone responded to an email sent to codice_8. An EV certificate means a certificate was issued for a domain like codice_7, and a company like Example, LLC is the owner of the domain, and the owner was verified by Articles of Incorporation.

Extended validation does not add any additional security controls, so the secure channel setup using an EV certificate is not &quot;stronger&quot; than a channel setup using a different level of validation like DV.

Extended validation is signaled in a certificate using X.509 v3 extension. Each CA uses a different Object Identifier (OID) to assert extended validation. There is no single OID to indicate extended validation, which complicates user agent programming. Each user agent must have a list of OIDs that indicate extended validation.

The CA/Browser Forum&#x27;s PKI recognizes extended validation and many browsers provide visual feedback to the user to indicate a site provides an EV certificate. Other PKIs, like the Internet&#x27;s PKI (PKIX), do not place any special emphasis on extended validation. Tools using PKIX policies, like cURL and Wget, simply treat an EV certificate like any other certificate.

Security expert Peter Gutmann states CA&#x27;s created EV certificates to restore profit levels after the Race to the Bottom cut into profits. During the race to the bottom CA&#x27;s cut prices to lure consumers to purchase their certificates. As a result, profits were reduced and CA&#x27;s dropped the level of validation they were performing to the point there were nearly no assurances on a certificate.

===Certificate filename extensions===
There are several commonly used filename extensions for X.509 certificates. Some of these extensions are also used for other data such as private keys.

* codice_10 – (Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail) Base64 encoded DER certificate, enclosed between and 
* codice_11, codice_12, codice_13 – usually in binary DER form, but Base64-encoded certificates are common too (see codice_10 above)
* codice_15, codice_16, codice_17 – exported private key as specified in PKCS#8. May be in DER or PEM form that starts with . The encrypted key starts with and may have the codice_16 extension.
* codice_19, codice_20 – PKCS#10 a certificate signing request (CSR). In PEM form starts with . These are generated for submission to certificate-authorities (CA). It includes key details of the requested certificate such as Common Name (/CN), subject, organization, state, country, as well as the &quot;public key&quot; of the certificate to get signed. These get signed by the CA and a certificate is returned. The returned certificate is the public &quot;certificate&quot; (which includes the public key but not the private key), which itself can be in a couple of formats but usually in codice_21.
* codice_21 – PKCS#7 response to CSR. Contains the newly-signed certificate, and the CA&#x27;s own cert.
* codice_23 – PKCS#7 Digital Signature. May contain the original signed file or message. Used in S/MIME for email signing. Defined in RFC 2311.
* codice_24 – PKCS#7 (SignedData, EnvelopedData) Message e.g. encrypted (&quot;enveloped&quot;) file, message or MIME email letter. Defined in RFC 2311.
* codice_25 – PKCS#7 degenerated SignedData &quot;certs-only&quot; structure, without any data to sign. Defined in RFC 2311.
* codice_26, codice_27 – PKCS#7 SignedData structure without data, just certificate(s) bundle and/or CRLs (rarely) but not a private key. Uses DER form or BER or PEM that starts with . The format used by Windows for certificate interchange. Supported by Java but often has codice_27 as an extension instead. Unlike codice_10 style certificates, this format has a &quot;defined&quot; way to include certification-path certificates.
* codice_30, codice_31, codice_32 – PKCS#12, may contain certificate(s) (public) and private keys (password protected) in a single file. codice_31 – &quot;Personal Information eXchange&quot; PFX, predecessor of PKCS#12 (usually contains data in PKCS#12 format, e.g. with PFX files generated in IIS).
* codice_34 – A Certificate Revocation List (CRL). Certificate Authorities produce these as a way to de-authorize certificates before expiration.

PKCS#7 is a standard for signing or encrypting (officially called &quot;enveloping&quot;) data. Since the certificate is needed to verify signed data, it is possible to include them in the SignedData structure.

==Certificate chains and cross-certification==
A certificate chain (see the equivalent concept of &quot;certification path&quot; defined by section 3.2) is a list of certificates (usually starting with an end-entity certificate) followed by one or more CA certificates (usually the last one being a self-signed certificate), with the following properties:
# The Issuer of each certificate (except the last one) matches the Subject of the next certificate in the list
# Each certificate (except the last one) is signed by the secret key corresponding to the next certificate in the chain (i.e. the signature of one certificate can be verified using the public key contained in the following certificate)
# The last certificate in the list is a trust anchor: a certificate that you trust because it was delivered to you by some trustworthy procedure

Certificate chains are used in order to check that the public key (PK) contained in a target certificate (the first certificate in the chain) and other data contained in it effectively belongs to its subject. In order to ascertain this, the signature on the target certificate is verified by using the PK contained in the following certificate, whose signature is verified using the next certificate, and so on until the last certificate in the chain is reached. As the last certificate is a trust anchor, successfully reaching it will prove that the target certificate can be trusted.

The description in the preceding paragraph is a simplified view on the certification path validation process as defined by section 6, which involves additional checks, such as verifying validity dates on certificates, looking up CRLs, etc.


Examining how certificate chains are built and validated, it is important to note that a concrete certificate can be part of very different certificate chains (all of them valid). This is because several CA certificates can be generated for the same subject and public key, but be signed with different private keys (from different CAs or different private keys from the same CA). So, although a single X.509 certificate can have only one issuer and one CA signature, it can be validly linked to more than one certificate, building completely different certificate chains. This is crucial for cross-certification between PKIs and other applications.
See the following examples:

===Examples===
In these diagrams:
* Each box represents a certificate, with its Subject in bold
* A → B means &quot;A is signed by B&quot; (or, more precisely, &quot;A is signed by the secret key corresponding to the public key contained in B&quot;). 
* Certificates with the same color (that are not white/transparent) contain the same public key

====Example 1: Cross-certification at root Certification Authority (CA) level between two PKIs====
In order to manage that user certificates existing in PKI 2 (like &quot;User 2&quot;) are trusted by PKI 1, CA1 generates a certificate (cert2.1) containing the public key of CA2.
Now both &quot;cert2 and cert2.1 (in green) have the same subject and public key, so there are two valid chains for cert2.2 (User 2): &quot;cert2.2 → cert2&quot; and &quot;cert2.2 → cert2.1 → cert1&quot;.

Similarly, CA2 can generate a certificate (cert1.1) containing the public key of CA1 so that user certificates existing in PKI 1 (like &quot;User 1&quot;) are trusted by PKI 2.

====Example 2: CA certificate renewal====
Since both cert1 and cert3 contain the same public key (the old one), there are two valid certificate chains for cert5: &quot;cert5 → cert1&quot; and &quot;cert5 → cert3 → cert2&quot;, and analogously for cert6. This allows that old user certificates (such as cert5) and new certificates (such as cert6) can be trusted indifferently by a party having either the new root CA certificate or the old one as trust anchor during the transition to the new CA keys.

==Sample X.509 certificates==
This is an example of a decoded X.509 certificate that was used in the past by wikipedia.org and several other Wikipedia websites. It was issued by GlobalSign, as stated in the Issuer field. Its Subject field describes Wikipedia as an organization, and its Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field for DNS describes the hostnames for which it could be used. The Subject Public Key Info field contains an ECDSA public key, while the signature at the bottom was generated by GlobalSign&#x27;s RSA private key. (The signatures in these examples are truncated.)

To validate this end-entity certificate, one needs an intermediate certificate that matches its Issuer and Authority Key Identifier:

In a TLS connection, a properly-configured server would provide the intermediate as part of the handshake. However, it&#x27;s also possible to retrieve the intermediate certificate by fetching the &quot;CA Issuers&quot; URL from the end-entity certificate.

=== Intermediate certificate ===
This is an example of an intermediate certificate belonging to a certificate authority. This certificate signed the end-entity certificate above, and was signed by the root certificate below. Note that the subject field of this intermediate certificate matches the issuer field of the end-entity certificate that it signed. Also, the &quot;subject key identifier&quot; field in the intermediate matches the &quot;authority key identifier&quot; field in the end-entity certificate.

=== Root certificate ===
This is an example of a self-signed root certificate representing a certificate authority. Its issuer and subject fields are the same, and its signature can be validated with its own public key. Validation of the trust chain has to end here. If the validating program has this root certificate in its trust store, the end-entity certificate can be considered trusted for use in a TLS connection. Otherwise, the end-entity certificate is considered untrusted.

==Security==
There are a number of publications about PKI problems by Bruce Schneier, Peter Gutmann and other security experts.

===Architectural weaknesses===
*Use of blocklisting invalid certificates (using CRLs and OCSP),
**If the client only trusts certificates when CRLs are available, then they lose the offline capability that makes PKI attractive. So most clients do trust certificates when CRLs are not available, but in that case an attacker that controls the communication channel can disable the CRLs. Adam Langley of Google has said soft-fail CRL checks are like a safety belt that works except when you have an accident.
*CRLs are notably a poor choice because of large sizes and convoluted distribution patterns,
*Ambiguous OCSP semantics and lack of historical revocation status,
*Revocation of root certificates is not addressed,
*Aggregation problem: Identity claims (authenticate with an identifier), attribute claims (submit a bag of vetted attributes), and policy claims are combined in a single container. This raises privacy, policy mapping, and maintenance issues.
*Delegation problem: CAs cannot technically restrict subordinate CAs from issuing certificates outside a limited namespaces or attribute set; this feature of X.509 is not in use. Therefore, a large number of CAs exist on the Internet, and classifying them and their policies is an insurmountable task. Delegation of authority within an organization cannot be handled at all, as in common business practice.
*Federation problem: Certificate chains that are the result of subordinate CAs, bridge CAs, and cross-signing make validation complex and expensive in terms of processing time. Path validation semantics may be ambiguous. The hierarchy with a third-party trusted party is the only model. This is inconvenient when a bilateral trust relationship is already in place.
*Issuance of an Extended Validation (EV) certificate for a hostname doesn&#x27;t prevent issuance of a lower-validation certificate valid for the same hostname, which means that the higher validation level of EV doesn&#x27;t protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

===Problems with certification authorities===
* The person or organization that purchases a certificate will often utilize the least expensive certification authority. In response, CA&#x27;s have cut prices and removed more expensive validation checks in what is known as a Race to the Bottom. The Race to the Bottom is partly addressed by Extended Validation (EV) certificates, yet trust value in the eyes of security experts are diminishing. According to Peter Gutmann, EV certificates do not add any additional security controls. Rather, EV certificates merely restore CA profits to levels prior to the Race to the Bottom by allowing a CA to charge more for a service they should have been providing all along.
* Certification authorities attempt to deny almost all warranties to the user and relying parties in their Certification Practice Statement (CPS). For example, Apple Inc states in their CPS, &quot;To the extent permitted by applicable law, Subscriber agreements, if applicable, disclaim warranties from Apple, including any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose&quot;.
* According to Peter Gutmann, &quot;Users use an undefined certification request protocol to obtain a certificate which is published in an unclear location in a nonexistent directory with no real means to revoke it&quot;
* Like all businesses, CAs are subject to the legal jurisdictions they operate within, and may be legally compelled to compromise the interests of their customers and their users. Intelligence agencies have also made use of false certificates issued through extralegal compromise of CAs, such as DigiNotar, to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks. Another example is a revocation request of the CA of the Dutch government, because of a Dutch law passed in 2018, giving new powers for the Dutch intelligence and security services

===Implementation issues===
Implementations suffer from design flaws, bugs, different interpretations of standards and lack of interoperability of different standards. Some problems are:
* Many implementations turn off revocation check:
** Seen as obstacle, policies are not enforced
** If it was turned on in all browsers by default, including code signing, it would probably crash the infrastructure
* DNs are complex and little understood (lack of canonicalization, internationalization problems)
* rfc822Name has two notations
* Name and policy constraints hardly supported
* Key usage ignored, first certificate in a list being used
* Enforcement of custom OIDs is difficult
* Attributes should not be made critical because it makes clients crash
* Unspecified length of attributes lead to product-specific limits
* There are implementation errors with X.509 that allow e.g. falsified subject names using null-terminated strings or code injection attacks in certificates
* By using illegal 0x80 padded subidentifiers of object identifiers, wrong implementations or by using integer overflows of the client&#x27;s browsers, an attacker can include an unknown attribute in the CSR, which the CA will sign, which the client wrongly interprets as &quot;CN&quot; (OID=2.5.4.3). Dan Kaminsky demonstrated this at the 26th Chaos Communication Congress &quot;Black OPs of PKI&quot;

===Cryptographic weaknesses===
Digital signature systems depend on secure cryptographic hash functions to work. When a public key infrastructure allows the use of a hash function that is no longer secure, an attacker can exploit weaknesses in the hash function to forge certificates. Specifically, if an attacker is able to produce a hash collision, they can convince a CA to sign a certificate with innocuous contents, where the hash of those contents is identical to the hash of another, malicious set of certificate contents, created by the attacker with values of their choosing. The attacker can then append the CA-provided signature to their malicious certificate contents, resulting in a malicious certificate that appears to be signed by the CA. Because the malicious certificate contents are chosen solely by the attacker, they can have different validity dates or hostnames than the innocuous certificate. The malicious certificate can even contain a &quot;CA: true&quot; field making it able to issue further trusted certificates.
* MD2-based certificates were used for a long time and were vulnerable to preimage attacks. Since the root certificate already had a self-signature, attackers could use this signature and use it for an intermediate certificate.
* In 2005, Arjen Lenstra and Benne de Weger demonstrated &quot;how to use hash collisions to construct two X.509 certificates that contain identical signatures and that differ only in the public keys&quot;, achieved using a collision attack on the MD5 hash function.
* In 2008, Alexander Sotirov and Marc Stevens presented at the Chaos Communication Congress a practical attack that allowed them to create a rogue Certificate Authority, accepted by all common browsers, by exploiting the fact that RapidSSL was still issuing X.509 certificates based on MD5.
* In April 2009 at the Eurocrypt Conference, Australian Researchers of Macquarie University presented &quot;Automatic Differential Path Searching for SHA-1&quot;. The researchers were able to deduce a method which increases the likelihood of a collision by several orders of magnitude.
* In February 2017, a group of researchers led by Marc Stevens produced a SHA-1 collision, demonstrating SHA-1&#x27;s weakness.

==== Mitigations for cryptographic weaknesses ====
Exploiting a hash collision to forge X.509 signatures requires that the attacker be able to predict the data that the certificate authority will sign. This can be somewhat mitigated by the CA generating a random component in the certificates it signs, typically the serial number. The CA/Browser Forum has required serial number entropy in its Baseline Requirements Section 7.1 since 2011.

, the Baseline Requirements forbid issuance of certificates using SHA-1. , Chrome and Firefox reject certificates that use SHA-1. both Edge and Safari are also rejecting SHA-1 certificate. OpenSSL began rejecting SHA-1 certificates by default in version 3.0, released September 2021.

==PKI standards for X.509==
* PKCS7 (Cryptographic Message Syntax Standard — public keys with proof of identity for signed and/or encrypted message for PKI)
* Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor SSL — cryptographic protocols for Internet secure communications.
* Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) / certificate revocation list (CRL) — this is to check certificate revocation status
* PKCS12 (Personal Information Exchange Syntax Standard) — used to store a private key with the appropriate public key certificate
* — Certification Path Building — guidance and recommendations for building X.509 public-key certification paths within applications (i.e., validating an end-entity certificate using a CA certificate)

==PKIX Working Group==
In 1995, the Internet Engineering Task Force in conjunction with the National Institute of Standards and Technology formed the Public-Key Infrastructure (X.509) working group. The working group, concluded in June 2014, is commonly referred to as &quot;PKIX.&quot; It produced RFCs and other standards documentation on using and deploying X.509 in practice. In particular it produced and its successor RFC 5280, which define how to use X.509 in Internet protocols.

==Major protocols and standards using X.509 certificates==
TLS/SSL and HTTPS use the profile of X.509, as do S/MIME (Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) and the EAP-TLS method for WiFi authentication. Any protocol that uses TLS, such as SMTP, POP, IMAP, LDAP, XMPP, and many more, inherently uses X.509.

IPsec can use the profile for authenticating peers.

The OpenCable security specification defines its own profile of X.509 for use in the cable industry.

Devices like smart cards and TPMs often carry certificates to identify themselves or their owners. These certificates are in X.509 form.

The WS-Security standard defines authentication either through TLS or through its own certificate profile. Both methods use X.509.

The Microsoft Authenticode code signing system uses X.509 to identify authors of computer programs. Secure Boot feature of UEFI uses X.509 to authenticate UEFI drivers or bootloaders during booting and disallow blocklisted drivers or bootloaders (by using Forbidden Key Exchange or dbx database).

The OPC UA industrial automation communication standard uses X.509.

SSH generally uses a Trust On First Use security model and doesn&#x27;t have need for certificates. However, the popular OpenSSH implementation does support a CA-signed identity model based on its own non-X.509 certificate format.

<text>Major-general Sir Samuel Benfield Steele (5 January 1848 – 30 January 1919) was a Canadian soldier and policeman. He was an officer of the North-West Mounted Police, head of the Yukon detachment during the Klondike Gold Rush, and commanding officer of Strathcona&#x27;s Horse during the Boer War.

==Early life==
Born into a military family at Medonte Township, Province of Canada (now Ontario), he was the son of Royal Navy Captain Elmes Yelverton Steele, a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, and one of six brothers to have served in the British Armed Forces. His mother (his father&#x27;s second wife), Anne Macdonald, was the youngest daughter of Neil Maclain MacDonald of Ardnamurchan, a native of Islay. Neil MacDonald was a grandson of Captain Godfrey MacNeil of Barra, and a nephew of Colonel Donald MacNeil. Steele was named for his father&#x27;s uncle, Colonel Samuel Steele, who served in Quebec under Lord Amherst. Steele received his education at the family home, Purbrook, and then at the Royal Military College of Canada. By the age of 13 he was orphaned, and went to live with his elder half-brother, John Steele.

==Early military ==
Following his family&#x27;s military tradition, in 1866 Steele joined the Canadian Militia during the Fenian raids, first joining the 35th Simcoe Battalion of Infantry and after moving to Clarksburg (near Collingwood) was commissioned as an officer in the 31st Grey Battalion of Infantry. Steele also participated in the Red River Expedition in 1870 to fight the Red River Rebellion of Louis Riel. Much to his disappointment, he arrived after the Métis had surrendered. The following year he joined the Permanent Force artillery, Canada&#x27;s first regular army unit. Steele had long been fascinated by the West, devouring the works of James Fenimore Cooper in his youth. He was especially interested in the First Nations, and spent his time in the West learning from them and the Métis. However, he was assigned to Fort Henry in Kingston, Ontario, for the next few years, as an instructor at the Artillery School. In 1874, Steele was initiated as a Freemason in the Lisgar Lodge No. 2, in Selkirk, Manitoba.

== Life as Mountie ==

In 1873, Steele was the third officer sworn into the newly formed North-West Mounted Police (NWMP), entering as a staff constable. He was one of the officers to lead the new recruits of the NWMP on the 1874 March West, when he returned to Fort Garry, present-day Winnipeg, Manitoba. To him fell the rank of staff sergeant major and the responsibility, as an accomplished horseman and man-at-arms, of drilling the new recruits. In 1878, Steele was given his own command at Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle, North-West Territories.

In 1877, he was assigned to meet with Sitting Bull, who, having defeated Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer at the Little Bighorn, had moved with his people into Canada to escape American vengeance. Steele along with U.S. Army Major General Alfred Howe Terry attempted to persuade Sitting Bull to return to the United States. (Most of the Sioux returned a few years later.)

During the North-West Rebellion, Steele was dispatched with a small force. Missing the Battle of Batoche, the Mounties were sent to move against the last resistance force led by Big Bear. He was present at the Battle of Frenchman&#x27;s Butte, where Big Bear&#x27;s warriors defeated the Canadian forces under General Thomas Bland Strange. Two weeks later, Steele and his two dozen Mounties defeated Big Bear&#x27;s force at Loon Lake, District of Saskatchewan, in the last battle fought on Canadian territory. The contributions of the NWMP in putting down the rebellion went largely ignored and unrewarded, to Steele&#x27;s great annoyance. By 1885, Steele was recalled to Calgary, where he was tasked with organizing and commanding the scouting contingent for Major General T.B. Strange’s Alberta Field Force. Steele’s Scouts performed well, which led to his promotion to superintendent after the rebellion. He established an NWMP station in the town of Galbraiths Ferry, which was later named to Fort Steele in British Columbia, after Steele solved a murder in the town. He then moved on to Fort Macleod, District of Alberta, in 1888.

In 1887, Steele was ordered to take “D” Division to southeastern British Columbia, where the provincial government had mismanaged relations with the Ktunaxa (Kootenay) nation to the point that violence was threatened. Steele’s men built Fort Steele on the Kootenay River, and he resolved the situation through patient diplomacy with Chief Isadore. The division returned to Fort Macleod in the summer of 1888, and Steele commanded that post, the largest outside NWMP headquarters in Regina, for the next decade.

In 1889, at Fort Macleod, he met Marie-Elizabeth de Lotbinière-Harwood (1859–1951), daughter of Robert William Harwood. They were married at Vaudreuil, Quebec, in 1890. They had three children, including Harwood Steele, who fictionalized episodes from his father&#x27;s life in novels such as &quot;Spirit-of-Iron&quot; (1929).

The discovery of gold in the Klondike in the late 1890s presented Steele with a new challenge. Although he campaigned unsuccessfully for the position of assistant commissioner in 1892, in January 1898, he was sent to succeed Charles Constantine as commissioner and to establish customs posts at the head of the White and Chilkoot Passes, and at Lake Bennett. He was noted for his hard line with the hundreds of unruly and independent-minded prospectors, many of them American. To help control the situation, he established the rule that no one would be allowed to enter the Yukon without a ton of goods to support himself, thus preventing the entry of desperate and potentially-unruly speculators and adventurers.

Steele and his force made the Klondike Gold Rush one of the most orderly of its kind in history and made the NWMP famous around the world, which ensured its survival at a critical time, as the force&#x27;s dissolution was being debated in Parliament. By July 1898, Steele commanded all the NWMP in the Yukon area, and was a member of the territorial council. As the force reported directly to Ottawa, Steele had almost free rein to run things as he chose, always with an eye towards maintaining law, order, and Canadian sovereignty. He moved to Dawson City in September 1898.

== Boer War and second military career ==
Always a soldier, in early 1900, Steele leapt at the offer of Canadian Pacific Railway tycoon Donald Smith, Baron Strathcona, to be the first commanding officer of Smith&#x27;s privately-raised cavalry unit, Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (predecessor of the modern armoured unit, Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians)), with the appointment as lieutenant-colonel from 7 March 1900. This Canadian light cavalry unit, in British Imperial service, was sent to South Africa during the Second Boer War, where Steele commanded them with distinction in the role of reconnaissance scouts. Steele, however, apparently disliked greatly what he was ordered to do by the British, which included burning towns, farms and homesteads, killing livestock of the Boer families and moving the populace to concentration camps. After the war, the regiment arrived in London in February 1901. Here they met Lord Strathcona for the first time and were presented with medals by King Edward VII during a visit to Buckingham Palace. Steele was also appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (fourth class) (MVO), a personal gift from the King. On its return to Canada the regiment was disbanded, and the officers received honorary promotions. Steele was promoted to honorary lieutenant colonel in March 1901.

After taking the unit back to Canada early in 1901, Steele returned to South Africa that same year to command &#x27;B&#x27; Division of the South African Constabulary, a position he held until 1906. On his return to Canada in 1907, Steele assumed command of Military Division No. 13 in Alberta and the District of Mackenzie, and then in 1910 assumed command of Division No. 10 at Winnipeg, where he spent his time regrouping Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse and in preparing his memoirs.

Steele requested active military duty upon the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. He was initially rejected for command on the grounds of age. However, a compromise was reached which allowed him to act as commander of the 2nd Canadian Division until the formation was sent to France, whereupon he would be replaced. After accompanying the division to England, Steele was offered an administrative post as commanding officer of the South-East District.

Matters were complicated, however, when Canadian Minister of Defence Sam Hughes insisted that Steele also be made commander of all Canadian troops in Europe, a slight problem, as there were two brigadier-generals who each believed the Canadian command was his. The issue was not resolved until 1916, when the new Minister of Overseas Military Forces of Canada, Sir G. H. Perley, removed Steele from his Canadian command after Steele refused to return to Canada as a recruiter. He kept his British command until his retirement on 15 July 1918. While in Britain, Steele was knighted, on 1 January 1918, and was made a Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, and Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George.

== Death and legacy ==
Steele died during the 1918 flu pandemic just after his 71st birthday. He was interred at the Cathedral of St. John Cemetery in Winnipeg.

Canada&#x27;s fifth-tallest mountain, Mount Steele, is named after him.

CFB Edmonton, the home of Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (Royal Canadians), is now called Steele Barracks after Major General Steele.

Steele Narrows at Loon Lake was the site of the battle of Loon Lake, the last battle in the North West Rebellion. Steele&#x27;s Alberta scouts fought there.

==Personal papers==
On 19 June 2008, Steele&#x27;s wealth of personal papers and writings were repatriated to Canada in a ceremony in Trafalgar Square in London, England, headed by the Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. Steele&#x27;s papers, believed by historians to contain a wealth of heretofore untold stories that would &quot;re-write Canadian history&quot; had been held by British descendants of Steele, and were returned via a $1.8 million purchase by the University of Alberta.

In 2020, the Orillia Museum of Art and History put on an exhibit of some of Steele’s correspondence with Thomas Blaney of Orillia, who helped Steele look after his family affairs while Steele was out of the country.

<doc id="296356" wikidata="Q1928707" url="?curid=296356" title="Web of trust">
<text>In cryptography, a web of trust is a concept used in PGP, GnuPG, and other OpenPGP-compatible systems to establish the authenticity of the binding between a public key and its owner. Its decentralized trust model is an alternative to the centralized trust model of a public key infrastructure (PKI), which relies exclusively on a certificate authority (or a hierarchy of such). As with computer networks, there are many independent webs of trust, and any user (through their public key certificate) can be a part of, and a link between, multiple webs.

The web of trust concept was first put forth by PGP creator Phil Zimmermann in 1992 in the manual for PGP version 2.0:
Note the use of the word emergence in this context. The web of trust makes use of the concept of emergence.

==Operation of a web of trust==
All OpenPGP-compliant implementations include a certificate vetting scheme to assist with this; its operation has been termed a web of trust. OpenPGP certificates (which include one or more public keys along with owner information) can be digitally signed by other users who, by that act, endorse the association of that public key with the person or entity listed in the certificate. This is commonly done at key signing parties.

OpenPGP-compliant implementations also include a vote counting scheme which can be used to determine which public key – owner association a user will trust while using PGP. For instance, if three partially trusted endorsers have vouched for a certificate (and so its included public key – owner binding), or if one fully trusted endorser has done so, the association between owner and public key in that certificate will be trusted to be correct. The parameters are user-adjustable (e.g., no partials at all, or perhaps six partials) and can be completely bypassed if desired.

The scheme is flexible, unlike most public key infrastructure designs, and leaves trust decisions in the hands of individual users. It is not perfect and requires both caution and intelligent supervision by users. Essentially all PKI designs are less flexible and require users to follow the trust endorsement of the PKI generated, certificate authority (CA)-signed, certificates.

There are two keys pertaining to a person: a public key which is shared openly and a private key that is withheld by the owner. The owner&#x27;s private key will decrypt any information encrypted with its public key. In the web of trust, each user has a key ring with other people&#x27;s public keys.

Senders encrypt their information with the recipient&#x27;s public key, and only the recipient&#x27;s private key will decrypt it. Each sender then digitally signs the encrypted information with their private key. When the recipient verifies the received encrypted information against the sender&#x27;s public key, they can confirm that it is from the sender. Doing this will ensure that the encrypted information came from the specific user and has not been tampered with, and only the intended recipient can decrypt the information (because only they know their private key).

==Contrast with typical PKI==
Unlike WOT, a typical X.509 PKI enables each certificate to be signed by a single party: a certificate authority (CA). The CA&#x27;s certificate may itself be signed by a different CA, all the way up to a &#x27;self-signed&#x27; root certificate. Root certificates must be available to those who use a lower-level CA certificate and so are typically distributed widely. They are for instance, distributed with such applications as browsers and email clients. In this way SSL/TLS-protected Web pages, email messages, etc. can be authenticated without requiring users to manually install root certificates. Applications commonly include over one hundred root certificates from dozens of PKIs, thus by default bestowing trust throughout the hierarchy of certificates which lead back to them.

WOT favors the decentralization of trust anchors to prevent a single point of failure from compromising the CA hierarchy.

==Problems==
=== Loss of private keys ===
The OpenPGP web of trust is essentially unaffected by such things as company failures, and has continued to function with little change. However, a related problem does occur: users, whether individuals or organizations, who lose track of a private key can no longer decrypt messages sent to them produced using the matching public key found in an OpenPGP certificate. Early PGP certificates did not include expiry dates, and those certificates had unlimited lives. Users had to prepare a signed cancellation certificate against the time when the matching private key was lost or compromised. One very prominent cryptographer is still getting messages encrypted using a public key for which he long ago lost track of the private key. They can&#x27;t do much with those messages except discard them after notifying the sender that they were unreadable and requesting resending with a public key for which they still have the matching private key. Later PGP, and all OpenPGP compliant certificates include expiry dates which automatically preclude such troubles (eventually) when used sensibly. This problem can also be easily avoided by the use of &quot;designated revokers&quot;, which were introduced in the early 1990s. A key owner may designate a third party that has permission to revoke the key owner&#x27;s key (in case the key owner loses his own private key and thus loses the ability to revoke his own public key).

=== Public key authenticity check ===
A non-technical, social difficulty with a Web of Trust like the one built into PGP/OpenPGP type systems is that every web of trust without a central controller (e.g., a CA) depends on other users for trust. Those with new certificates (i.e., produced in the process of generating a new key pair) will not likely be readily trusted by other users&#x27; systems, that is by those they have not personally met, until they find enough endorsements for the new certificate. This is because many other Web of Trust users will have their certificate vetting set to require one or more fully trusted endorsers of an otherwise unknown certificate (or perhaps several partial endorsers) before using the public key in that certificate to prepare messages, believe signatures, etc.

Despite the wide use of OpenPGP compliant systems and easy availability of on-line multiple key servers, it is possible in practice to be unable to readily find someone (or several people) to endorse a new certificate (e.g., by comparing physical identification to key owner information and then digitally signing the new certificate). Users in remote areas or undeveloped ones, for instance, may find other users scarce. And, if the other&#x27;s certificate is also new (and with no or few endorsements from others), then its signature on any new certificate can offer only marginal benefit toward becoming trusted by still other parties&#x27; systems and so able to securely exchange messages with them. Key signing parties are a relatively popular mechanism to resolve this problem of finding other users who can install one&#x27;s certificate in existing webs of trust by endorsing it. Websites also exist to facilitate the location of other OpenPGP users to arrange keysignings. The Gossamer Spider Web of Trust also makes key verification easier by linking OpenPGP users via a hierarchical style web of trust where end users can benefit by coincidental or determined trust of someone who is endorsed as an introducer, or by explicitly trusting GSWoT&#x27;s top-level key minimally as a level 2 introducer (the top-level key endorses level 1 introducers).

The possibility of finding chains of certificates is often justified by the &quot;small world phenomenon&quot;: given two individuals, it is often possible to find a short chain of people between them such that each person in the chain knows the preceding and following links. However, such a chain is not necessarily useful: the person encrypting an email or verifying a signature not only has to find a chain of signatures from their private key to their correspondent&#x27;s, but also to trust each person of the chain to be honest and competent about signing keys (that is, they have to judge whether these people are likely to honestly follow the guidelines about verifying the identity of people before signing keys). This is a much stronger constraint.

Another obstacle is the requirement to physically meet with someone (for example, at a key signing party) to verify their identity and ownership of a public key and email address, which may involve travel expenses and scheduling constraints affecting both sides. A software user may need to verify hundreds of software components produced by thousands of developers located around the world. As the general population of software users cannot meet in person with all software developers to establish direct trust, they must instead rely on the comparatively slower propagation of indirect trust.

Obtaining the PGP/GPG key of an author (or developer, publisher, etc.) from a public key server also presents risks, since the key server is a third-party middle-man, itself vulnerable to abuse or attacks. To avoid this risk, an author can instead choose to publish their public key on their own key server (i.e., a web server accessible through a domain name owned by them, and securely located in their private office or home) and require the use of HKPS-encrypted connections for the transmission of their public key. For details, see WOT Assisting Solutions below.

== Strong set ==

The strong set refers to the largest collection of strongly connected PGP keys. This forms the basis for the global web of trust. Any two keys in the strong set have a path between them; while islands of sets of keys that only sign each other in a disconnected group can and do exist, only one member of that group needs to exchange signatures with the strong set for that group to also become a part of the strong set. 

Henk P. Penning charted the growth in the size of the strong set from approximately 18,000 in early 2003 to approximately 62,000 at the beginning of 2018; however, it then decreased and by May of 2019 it was at approximately 57,500. In a paper published in September 2022, Gunnar Wolf and Jorge Luis Ortega-Arjona mentioned the size of the strong set as being 60,000.

==Mean shortest distance==
In statistical analysis of the PGP/GnuPG/OpenPGP Web of trust the mean shortest distance (MSD) is one measurement of how &quot;trusted&quot; a given PGP key is within the strongly connected set of PGP keys that make up the Web of trust.

MSD has become a common metric for analysis of sets of PGP keys. Very often you will see the MSD being calculated for a given subset of keys and compared with the &quot;global MSD&quot; which generally refers to the keys ranking within one of the larger key analyses of the global Web of trust.

==WOT assisting solutions==

Physically meeting with original developer or author, is always the best way to obtain and distribute and verify and trust PGP/GPG Keys with highest trust level, and will remain as the best level of best trustworthy way. Publishing of GPG/PGP full Key or full Key fingerprint on/with widely known (physical/paper-material based) book, by the original author/developer, is the 2nd best form of sharing trustworthy key with and for users. Before meeting a developer or author, users should research on their own on the developer or author in book library and via internet, and aware of developer&#x27;s or author&#x27;s photo, work, pub-key fingerprint, email-address, etc.

However, it is not practical for millions of users who want to communicate or message securely to physically meet with each recipient users, and it is also not practical for millions of software users who need to physically meet with hundreds of software developers or authors, whose software or file signing PGP/GPG public Key they want to verify and trust and ultimately use in their computers. Therefore, one or more trusted third-party authority (TTPA) type of entity or group need to be available for users and be usable by users, and such entity/group need to be capable of providing trusted-verification or trust-delegation services for millions of users around the world, at any time.

Practically, to verify any downloaded or received content or data or email or file&#x27;s authenticity, a user need to verify their downloaded main content or main data/email or main file&#x27;s PGP/GPG signature code/file (ASC, SIG). So users would need to use original developer&#x27;s or original author&#x27;s trustworthy and verified public-key, or users would need to use trustworthy file-signing public-key trusted-by the original owner of that public-key. And to really trust a specific PGP/GPG key, users would need to physically meet with every specific original author or developer, or users would need to physically meet with the original-releaser of file-signing pub-key, or, users would need to find another alternative trustworthy user, who is in trusted-chain of WOT (aka, another user or another developer or another author, who is trusted by that very specific original author or developer), and then physically meet with that person, to verify their real ID with his/her PGP/GPG key (and also provide your own ID and key to the other user, so that both side can sign/certify and trust each other&#x27;s PGP/GPG key). Whether a software is popular or not, software users are usually located around the world in different locations. It is physically not possible for an original author or developer or file-releaser to provide public-key or trust or ID verification services to millions of users. Neither is it practical for millions of software users to physically meet with each and every software or every software-library or every piece of code&#x27;s developer or author or releaser, which they will (use or) need to use in their computers. Even with multiple trusted people/person (by original-author) in trusted-chain from WOT, its still not physically or practically possible for every developer or author to meet with every other users, and it is also not possible for every users to meet with hundreds of developers whose software they will be using or working on. When this decentralized hierarchy based WoT chain model will become popular and used by most nearby users, only then physical meeting and pub-key certify and sign procedure of WoT will be easier.

A few solutions are: original author/developer need to first set a trust-level to sign/certify their own file-signing key. Then updated public-keys and updated file-signing public-keys must also have to be published and distributed (or made accessible) to users, via online secure and encrypted mediums, so that any user from any location in world, can get the correct and trusted and unmodified public-key. To make sure that each users are getting the correct and trusted public-keys and signed-code/file, original dev/author or original-releaser must publish their updated public-keys on their own key server and force HKPS encrypted connection usage, or publish their updated and full public-keys (and signed-code/file) on their own HTTPS encrypted webpage, under their own web server, from their own primary domain website, (not-from any sub-domains which are located in external-servers, not-from any mirror, not-from any external/shared forum/wiki etc website servers, not-from any public or external/shared cloud or hosting service servers), and must have to be located and kept securely inside their own premises: own-home, own-home-office, or own-office. In that way, those small pieces of original keys/code, will travel intact through internet and will remain unmodified during transit (because of encrypted connection) and will reach destination without being eavesdropped or modified, into user&#x27;s side, and can be treated as trustworthy public-keys because of single or multi channel TTPA based verification. When a public-key is obtained (from original developer&#x27;s own web-server) via more than one TTPA (trusted third party authority) based secured, verified and encrypted connection, then it is more trustworthy.

When original public-keys/signed-codes are shown in original dev&#x27;s or author&#x27;s own web server or key server, over encrypted connection or encrypted webpage, then any other files, data or content can be transferred over any type of non-encrypted connection, like: HTTP/FTP etc from any sub-domain server or from any mirror or from any shared cloud/hosting servers, because, non-encrypted connection based downloaded items/data/files can be authenticated later, by using the original public-keys/signed-codes, which were obtained from the original author&#x27;s/developer&#x27;s own server over secured, encrypted, and trusted (aka, verified) connection/channels.

Using encrypted connection to transfer keys or signed/signature code/files, allow software users to delegate their trust with a PKI TTPA (trusted third party authority), like public CA (Certificate Authority), to help in providing trusted connection in between the original developer/author&#x27;s web server, and millions of worldwide users&#x27; computers, at any time.

When the original author/developer&#x27;s domain-name and name-server is signed by DNSSEC, and when used SSL/TLS public certificate is declared/shown in TLSA/DANE DNSSec DNS resource-record, (and when SSL/TLS Certs in the trust chain are pinned and used via HPKP technique by web servers), then a web-server&#x27;s webpage or data can also be verified via another PKI TTPA: DNSSEC and DNS namespace maintainer ICANN, other than a public CA. DNSSEC is another form of PGP/GPG WOT but for name-servers; it creates a trusted-chain for name-servers first (instead of people/person), and then people/person&#x27;s PGP/GPG Keys and fingerprints can also be added into a server&#x27;s DNSSEC DNS records. So any users who want to communicate securely (or any software users), can effectively get/receive their data/key/code/webpage etc. verified (aka, authenticated) via two (aka, dual/double) trusted PKI TTPAs/Channels at the same time: ICANN (DNSSEC) and CA (SSL/TLS Certificate). So PGP/GPG key/signed-code data (or file) can be trusted, when such solutions and techniques are used: HKPS, HKPS+DNSSEC+DANE, HTTPS, HTTPS+HPKP or HTTPS+HPKP+DNSSEC+DANE.

If a vast number of user&#x27;s group create their own new DLV based DNSSEC registry, and if users use that new DLV (along with ICANN-DNSSEC) root-key in their own local DNSSEC-based DNS Resolver/Server, and if domain-owners also use it for additional signing of their own domain-names, then there can be a new third TTPA. In such case, any PGP/GPG Key/signed-code data or a webpage or web data can be three/triple-channel verified. ISC&#x27;s DLV itself can be used as a third TTPA as its still used widely and active, so availability of another new DLV will become fourth TTPA.

<text>In cryptography and computer security, a root certificate is a public key certificate that identifies a root certificate authority (CA). Root certificates are self-signed (and it is possible for a certificate to have multiple trust paths, say if the certificate was issued by a root that was cross-signed) and form the basis of an X.509-based public key infrastructure (PKI). Either it has matched Authority Key Identifier with Subject Key Identifier, in some cases there is no Authority Key identifier, then Issuer string should match with Subject string (). For instance, the PKIs supporting HTTPS for secure web browsing and electronic signature schemes depend on a set of root certificates.

A certificate authority can issue multiple certificates in the form of a tree structure. A root certificate is the top-most certificate of the tree, the private key which is used to &quot;sign&quot; other certificates. All certificates signed by the root certificate, with the &quot;CA&quot; field set to true, inherit the trustworthiness of the root certificate—a signature by a root certificate is somewhat analogous to &quot;notarizing&quot; identity in the physical world. Such a certificate is called an intermediate certificate or subordinate CA certificate. Certificates further down the tree also depend on the trustworthiness of the intermediates.

The root certificate is usually made trustworthy by some mechanism other than a certificate, such as by secure physical distribution. For example, some of the best-known root certificates are distributed in operating systems by their manufacturers. Microsoft distributes root certificates belonging to members of the Microsoft Root Certificate Program to Windows desktops and Windows Phone 8. Apple distributes root certificates belonging to members of its own root program.

==Incidents of root certificate misuse==

===DigiNotar hack of 2011===

In 2011, the Dutch certificate authority DigiNotar suffered a security breach. This led to the issuing of various fraudulent certificates, which was among others abused to target Iranian Gmail users. The trust in DigiNotar certificates was retracted and the operational management of the company was taken over by the Dutch government.

===China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC) Issuance of Fake Certificates===
In 2009, an employee of the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC) applied to Mozilla to add CNNIC to Mozilla&#x27;s root certificate list and was approved. Later, Microsoft also added CNNIC to the root certificate list of Windows.

In 2015, many users chose not to trust the digital certificates issued by CNNIC because an intermediate CA issued by CNNIC was found to have issued fake certificates for Google domain names and raised concerns about CNNIC&#x27;s abuse of certificate issuing power.

On April 2, 2015, Google announced that it no longer recognized the electronic certificate issued by CNNIC. on April 4, following Google, Mozilla also announced that it no longer recognized the electronic certificate issued by CNNIC.

===WoSign and StartCom: Issuing fake and backdating certificates ===

In 2016, WoSign, China&#x27;s largest CA certificate issuer owned by Qihoo 360 and its Israeli subsidiary StartCom, were denied recognition of their certificates by Google. Microsoft removed the relevant certificates in 2017.

WoSign and StartCom issued hundreds of certificates with the same serial number in just five days, as well as issuing backdating certificates. WoSign and StartCom issued a fake GitHub certificate.

<text>In cryptography, a certificate revocation list (CRL) is &quot;a list of digital certificates that have been revoked by the issuing certificate authority (CA) before their scheduled expiration date and should no longer be trusted&quot;.

Publicly trusted CAs in the Web PKI are required (including by the CA/Browser forum) to issue CRLs for their certificates, and they widely do.

Browsers and other relying parties might use CRLs, or might use alternate certificate revocation technologies (such as OCSP) or CRLSets (a dataset derived from CRLs) to check certificate revocation status. Note that OCSP is falling out of favor due to privacy and performance concerns.

Subscribers and other parties can also use ARI.

==Revocation states==

There are two different states of revocation defined in RFC 5280:
; Revoked: A certificate is irreversibly revoked if, for example, it is discovered that the certificate authority (CA) had improperly issued a certificate, or if a private-key is thought to have been compromised. Certificates may also be revoked for failure of the identified entity to adhere to policy requirements, such as publication of false documents, misrepresentation of software behaviour, or violation of any other policy specified by the CA operator or its customer. The most common reason for revocation is the user no longer being in sole possession of the private key (e.g., the token containing the private key has been lost or stolen).
; Hold: This reversible status can be used to note the temporary invalidity of the certificate (e.g., if the user is unsure if the private key has been lost). If, in this example, the private key was found and nobody had access to it, the status could be reinstated, and the certificate is valid again, thus removing the certificate from future CRLs.

==Reasons for revocation==

Reasons to revoke, hold, or unlist a certificate according to RFC 5280 are:

* codice_1 (0)
* codice_2 (1)
* codice_3 (2)
* codice_4 (3)
* codice_5 (4)
* codice_6 (5)
* codice_7 (6)
* codice_8 (8)
* codice_9 (9)
* codice_10 (10)

Note that value 7 is not used.

==Publishing revocation lists==

A CRL is generated and published periodically, often at a defined interval. A CRL can also be published immediately after a certificate has been revoked. A CRL is issued by a CRL issuer, which is typically the CA which also issued the corresponding certificates, but could alternatively be some other trusted authority. All CRLs have a lifetime during which they are valid; this timeframe is often 24 hours or less. During a CRL&#x27;s validity period, it may be consulted by a PKI-enabled application to verify a certificate prior to use.

To prevent spoofing or denial-of-service attacks, CRLs usually carry a digital signature associated with the CA by which they are published. To validate a specific CRL prior to relying on it, the certificate of its corresponding CA is needed.

The certificates for which a CRL should be maintained are often X.509/public key certificates, as this format is commonly used by PKI schemes.

==Revocation versus expiration==

Expiration dates are not a substitute for a CRL. While all expired certificates are considered invalid, not all unexpired certificates should be valid. CRLs or other certificate validation techniques are a necessary part of any properly operated PKI, as mistakes in certificate vetting and key management are expected to occur in real world operations.

In a noteworthy example, a certificate for Microsoft was mistakenly issued to an unknown individual, who had successfully posed as Microsoft to the CA contracted to maintain the ActiveX &#x27;publisher certificate&#x27; system (VeriSign). Microsoft saw the need to patch their cryptography subsystem so it would check the status of certificates before trusting them. As a short-term fix, a patch was issued for the relevant Microsoft software (most importantly Windows) specifically listing the two certificates in question as &quot;revoked&quot;.

==Problems with certificate revocation lists==
Best practices require that wherever and however certificate status is maintained, it must be checked whenever one wants to rely on a certificate. Failing this, a revoked certificate may be incorrectly accepted as valid. This means that to use a PKI effectively, one must have access to current CRLs. This requirement of on-line validation negates one of the original major advantages of PKI over symmetric cryptography protocols, namely that the certificate is &quot;self-authenticating&quot;. Symmetric systems such as Kerberos also depend on the existence of on-line services (a key distribution center in the case of Kerberos).

The existence of a CRL implies the need for someone (or some organization) to enforce policy and revoke certificates deemed counter to operational policy. If a certificate is mistakenly revoked, significant problems can arise. As the certificate authority is tasked with enforcing the operational policy for issuing certificates, they typically are responsible for determining if and when revocation is appropriate by interpreting the operational policy.

The necessity of consulting a CRL (or other certificate status service) prior to accepting a certificate raises a potential denial-of-service attack against the PKI. If acceptance of a certificate fails in the absence of an available valid CRL, then no operations depending upon certificate acceptance can take place. This issue exists for Kerberos systems as well, where failure to retrieve a current authentication token will prevent system access.

An alternative to using CRLs is the certificate validation protocol known as Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). OCSP has the primary benefit of requiring less network bandwidth, enabling real-time and near real-time status checks for high volume or high-value operations.

As of Firefox 28, Mozilla has announced they are deprecating CRL in favour of OCSP.

CRL files may grow quite large over time e.g. in US government, for certain institution multiple megabytes. Therefore, incremental CRLs have been designed sometimes referred to as &quot;delta CRLs&quot;. However, only a few clients implement them.

== Authority revocation lists ==
An &quot;authority revocation list&quot; (ARL) is a form of CRL containing revoked certificates issued to certificate authorities, contrary to CRLs which contain revoked end-entity certificates.

<text>In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority (CA) is an entity that stores, signs, and issues digital certificates. A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate. This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon signatures or on assertions made about the private key that corresponds to the certified public key. A CA acts as a trusted third party—trusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate. The format of these certificates is specified by the X.509 or EMV standard.

One particularly common use for certificate authorities is to sign certificates used in HTTPS, the secure browsing protocol for the World Wide Web. Another common use is in issuing identity cards by national governments for use in electronically signing documents.

==Overview==
Trusted certificates can be used to create secure connections to a server via the Internet. A certificate is essential in order to circumvent a malicious party which happens to be on the route to a target server which acts as if it were the target. Such a scenario is commonly referred to as a man-in-the-middle attack. The client uses the CA certificate to authenticate the CA signature on the server certificate, as part of the authorizations before launching a secure connection. Usually, client software—for example, browsers—include a set of trusted CA certificates. This makes sense, as many users need to trust their client software. A malicious or compromised client can skip any security check and still fool its users into believing otherwise.

The clients of a CA are server supervisors who call for a certificate that their servers will bestow to users. Commercial CAs charge money to issue certificates, and their customers anticipate the CA&#x27;s certificate to be contained within the majority of web browsers, so that safe connections to the certified servers work efficiently out-of-the-box. The quantity of web browsers, other devices, and applications which trust a particular certificate authority is referred to as ubiquity. Mozilla, which is a non-profit business, issues several commercial CA certificates with its products. While Mozilla developed their own policy, the CA/Browser Forum developed similar guidelines for CA trust. A single CA certificate may be shared among multiple CAs or their resellers. A &quot;root&quot; CA certificate may be the base to issue multiple &quot;intermediate&quot; CA certificates with varying validation requirements.

In addition to commercial CAs, some non-profits issue publicly-trusted digital certificates without charge, for example Let&#x27;s Encrypt. Some large cloud computing and web hosting companies are also publicly-trusted CAs and issue certificates to services hosted on their infrastructure, for example IBM Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Cloudflare, and Google Cloud Platform.

Large organizations or government bodies may have their own PKIs (public key infrastructure), each containing their own CAs. Any site using self-signed certificates acts as its own CA.

Commercial banks that issue EMV payment cards are governed by the EMV Certificate Authority, payment schemes that route payment transactions initiated at Point of Sale Terminals (POS) to a Card Issuing Bank to transfer the funds from the card holder&#x27;s bank account to the payment recipient&#x27;s bank account. Each payment card presents along with its card data also the Card Issuer Certificate to the POS. The Issuer Certificate is signed by EMV CA Certificate. The POS retrieves the public key of EMV CA from its storage, validates the Issuer Certificate and authenticity of the payment card before sending the payment request to the payment scheme.

Browsers and other clients of sorts characteristically allow users to add or do away with CA certificates at will. While server certificates regularly last for a relatively short period, CA certificates are further extended, so, for repeatedly visited servers, it is less error-prone importing and trusting the CA issued, rather than confirm a security exemption each time the server&#x27;s certificate is renewed.

Less often, trustworthy certificates are used for encrypting or signing messages. CAs dispense end-user certificates too, which can be used with S/MIME. However, encryption entails the receiver&#x27;s public key and, since authors and receivers of encrypted messages, apparently, know one another, the usefulness of a trusted third party remains confined to the signature verification of messages sent to public mailing lists.

==Providers==
Worldwide, the certificate authority business is fragmented, with national or regional providers dominating their home market. This is because many uses of digital certificates, such as for legally binding digital signatures, are linked to local law, regulations, and accreditation schemes for certificate authorities.

However, the market for globally trusted TLS/SSL server certificates is largely held by a small number of multinational companies. This market has significant barriers to entry due to the technical requirements. While not legally required, new providers may choose to undergo annual security audits (such as WebTrust for certificate authorities in North America and ETSI in Europe) to be included as a trusted root by a web browser or operating system.

, 147 root certificates, representing 52 organizations, are trusted in the Mozilla Firefox web browser, 168 root certificates, representing 60 organizations, are trusted by macOS, and 255 root certificates, representing 101 organizations, are trusted by Microsoft Windows. As of Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean), Android currently contains over 100 CAs that are updated with each release.

On November 18, 2014, a group of companies and nonprofit organizations, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Mozilla, Cisco, and Akamai, announced Let&#x27;s Encrypt, a nonprofit certificate authority that provides free domain validated X.509 certificates as well as software to enable installation and maintenance of certificates. Let&#x27;s Encrypt is operated by the newly formed Internet Security Research Group, a California nonprofit recognized as federally tax-exempt.

According to Netcraft in May 2015, the industry standard for monitoring active TLS certificates, &quot;Although the global [TLS] ecosystem is competitive, it is dominated by a handful of major CAs — three certificate authorities (Symantec, Comodo, GoDaddy) account for three-quarters of all issued [TLS] certificates on public-facing web servers. The top spot has been held by Symantec (or VeriSign before it was purchased by Symantec) ever since [our] survey began, with it currently accounting for just under a third of all certificates. To illustrate the effect of differing methodologies, amongst the million busiest sites Symantec issued 44% of the valid, trusted certificates in use — significantly more than its overall market share.&quot;

In 2020, according to independent survey company Netcraft, &quot;DigiCert is the world&#x27;s largest high-assurance certificate authority, commanding 60% of the Extended Validation Certificate market, and 96% of organization-validated certificates globally.

 the survey company W3Techs, which collects statistics on certificate authority usage among the Alexa top 10 million and the Tranco top 1 million websites, lists the five largest authorities by absolute usage share as below. 

==Validation standards==

The commercial CAs that issue the bulk of certificates for HTTPS servers typically use a technique called &quot;domain validation&quot; to authenticate the recipient of the certificate. The techniques used for domain validation vary between CAs, but in general domain validation techniques are meant to prove that the certificate applicant controls a given domain name, not any information about the applicant&#x27;s identity.

Many Certificate Authorities also offer Extended Validation (EV) certificates as a more rigorous alternative to domain validated certificates. Extended validation is intended to verify not only control of a domain name, but additional identity information to be included in the certificate. Some browsers display this additional identity information in a green box in the URL bar. One limitation of EV as a solution to the weaknesses of domain validation is that attackers could still obtain a domain validated certificate for the victim domain, and deploy it during an attack; if that occurred, the difference observable to the victim user would be the absence of a green bar with the company name. There is some question whether users would be likely to recognize this absence as indicative of an attack being in progress: a test using Internet Explorer 7 in 2009 showed that the absence of IE7&#x27;s EV warnings were not noticed by users, however Microsoft&#x27;s newer browser, Edge Legacy, shows a significantly greater difference between EV and domain validated certificates, with domain validated certificates having a hollow, gray lock.

==Validation weaknesses==

Domain validation suffers from certain structural security limitations. In particular, it is always vulnerable to attacks that allow an adversary to observe the domain validation probes that CAs send. These can include attacks against the DNS, TCP, or BGP protocols (which lack the cryptographic protections of TLS/SSL), or the compromise of routers. Such attacks are possible either on the network near a CA, or near the victim domain itself.

One of the most common domain validation techniques involves sending an email containing an authentication token or link to an email address that is likely to be administratively responsible for the domain. This could be the technical contact email address listed in the domain&#x27;s WHOIS entry, or an administrative email like , , , or  the domain. Some Certificate Authorities may accept confirmation using , , or in the domain. The theory behind domain validation is that only the legitimate owner of a domain would be able to read emails sent to these administrative addresses.

Domain validation implementations have sometimes been a source of security vulnerabilities. In one instance, security researchers showed that attackers could obtain certificates for webmail sites because a CA was willing to use an email address like for domain.com, but not all webmail systems had reserved the &quot;ssladmin&quot; username to prevent attackers from registering it.

Prior to 2011, there was no standard list of email addresses that could be used for domain validation, so it was not clear to email administrators which addresses needed to be reserved. The first version of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements, adopted November 2011, specified a list of such addresses. This allowed mail hosts to reserve those addresses for administrative use, though such precautions are still not universal. In January 2015, a Finnish man registered the username &quot;hostmaster&quot; at the Finnish version of Microsoft Live and was able to obtain a domain-validated certificate for live.fi, despite not being the owner of the domain name.

==Issuing a certificate==

A CA issues digital certificates that contain a public key and the identity of the owner. The matching private key is not made available publicly, but kept secret by the end user who generated the key pair. The certificate is also a confirmation or validation by the CA that the public key contained in the certificate belongs to the person, organization, server or other entity noted in the certificate. A CA&#x27;s obligation in such schemes is to verify an applicant&#x27;s credentials, so that users and relying parties can trust the information in the issued certificate. CAs use a variety of standards and tests to do so. In essence, the certificate authority is responsible for saying &quot;yes, this person is who they say they are, and we, the CA, certify that&quot;.

If the user trusts the CA and can verify the CA&#x27;s signature, then they can also assume that a certain public key does indeed belong to whoever is identified in the certificate.

===Example===
Public-key cryptography can be used to encrypt data communicated between two parties. This can typically happen when a user logs on to any site that implements the HTTP Secure protocol. In this example let us suppose that the user logs on to their bank&#x27;s homepage www.bank.example to do online banking. When the user opens www.bank.example homepage, they receive a public key along with all the data that their web-browser displays. The public key could be used to encrypt data from the client to the server but the safe procedure is to use it in a protocol that determines a temporary shared symmetric encryption key; messages in such a key exchange protocol can be enciphered with the bank&#x27;s public key in such a way that only the bank server has the private key to read them.

The rest of the communication then proceeds using the new (disposable) symmetric key, so when the user enters some information to the bank&#x27;s page and submits the page (sends the information back to the bank) then the data the user has entered to the page will be encrypted by their web browser. Therefore, even if someone can access the (encrypted) data that was communicated from the user to www.bank.example, such eavesdropper cannot read or decipher it.

This mechanism is only safe if the user can be sure that it is the bank that they see in their web browser. If the user types in www.bank.example, but their communication is hijacked and a fake website (that pretends to be the bank website) sends the page information back to the user&#x27;s browser, the fake web-page can send a fake public key to the user (for which the fake site owns a matching private key). The user will fill the form with their personal data and will submit the page. The fake web-page will then get access to the user&#x27;s data.

This is what the certificate authority mechanism is intended to prevent. A certificate authority (CA) is an organization that stores public keys and their owners, and every party in a communication trusts this organization (and knows its public key). When the user&#x27;s web browser receives the public key from www.bank.example it also receives a digital signature of the key (with some more information, in a so-called X.509 certificate). The browser already possesses the public key of the CA and consequently can verify the signature, trust the certificate and the public key in it: since www.bank.example uses a public key that the certification authority certifies, a fake www.bank.example can only use the same public key. Since the fake www.bank.example does not know the corresponding private key, it cannot create the signature needed to verify its authenticity.

===Security===
It is difficult to assure correctness of match between data and entity when the data are presented to the CA (perhaps over an electronic network), and when the credentials of the person/company/program asking for a certificate are likewise presented. This is why commercial CAs often use a combination of authentication techniques including leveraging government bureaus, the payment infrastructure, third parties&#x27; databases and services, and custom heuristics. In some enterprise systems, local forms of authentication such as Kerberos can be used to obtain a certificate which can in turn be used by external relying parties. Notaries are required in some cases to personally know the party whose signature is being notarized; this is a higher standard than is reached by many CAs. According to the American Bar Association outline on Online Transaction Management the primary points of US Federal and State statutes enacted regarding digital signatures has been to &quot;prevent conflicting and overly burdensome local regulation and to establish that electronic writings satisfy the traditional requirements associated with paper documents.&quot; Further the US E-Sign statute and the suggested UETA code help ensure that:

# a signature, contract or other record relating to such transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form; and
# a contract relating to such transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely because an electronic signature or electronic record was used in its formation.

Despite the security measures undertaken to correctly verify the identities of people and companies, there is a risk of a single CA issuing a bogus certificate to an imposter. It is also possible to register individuals and companies with the same or very similar names, which may lead to confusion. To minimize this hazard, the &quot;certificate transparency&quot; initiative proposes auditing all certificates in a public unforgeable log, which could help in the prevention of phishing.

In large-scale deployments, Alice may not be familiar with Bob&#x27;s certificate authority (perhaps they each have a different CA server), so Bob&#x27;s certificate may also include his CA&#x27;s public key signed by a different CA2, which is presumably recognizable by Alice. This process typically leads to a hierarchy or mesh of CAs and CA certificates.

===Certificate revocation===

A certificate may be revoked before it expires, which signals that it is no longer valid. Without revocation, an attacker would be able to exploit such a compromised or misissued certificate until expiry. Hence, revocation is an important part of a public key infrastructure. Revocation is performed by the issuing CA, which produces a cryptographically authenticated statement of revocation.

For distributing revocation information to clients, timeliness of the discovery of revocation (and hence the window for an attacker to exploit a compromised certificate) trades off against resource usage in querying revocation statuses and privacy concerns. If revocation information is unavailable (either due to accident or an attack), clients must decide whether to &quot;fail-hard&quot; and treat a certificate as if it is revoked (and so degrade availability) or to &quot;fail-soft&quot; and treat it as unrevoked (and allow attackers to sidestep revocation).

Due to the cost of revocation checks and the availability impact from potentially-unreliable remote services, Web browsers limit the revocation checks they will perform, and will fail-soft where they do. Certificate revocation lists are too bandwidth-costly for routine use, and the Online Certificate Status Protocol presents connection latency and privacy issues. Other schemes have been proposed but have not yet been successfully deployed to enable fail-hard checking.

==Industry organizations==
*Certificate Authority Security Council (CASC) – In February 2013, the CASC was founded as an industry advocacy organization dedicated to addressing industry issues and educating the public on internet security. The founding members are the seven largest Certificate Authorities.
*Common Computing Security Standards Forum (CCSF) – In 2009 the CCSF was founded to promote industry standards that protect end users. Comodo Group CEO Melih Abdulhayoğlu is considered the founder of the CCSF.
*CA/Browser Forum – In 2005, a new consortium of Certificate Authorities and web browser vendors was formed to promote industry standards and baseline requirements for internet security. Comodo Group CEO Melih Abdulhayoğlu organized the first meeting and is considered the founder of the CA/Browser Forum.

=== Baseline requirements ===

The CA/Browser Forum publishes the Baseline Requirements, a list of policies and technical requirements for CAs to follow. These are a requirement for inclusion in the certificate stores of Firefox and Safari.

==CA compromise==
If the CA can be subverted, then the security of the entire system is lost, potentially subverting all the entities that trust the compromised CA.

For example, suppose an attacker, Eve, manages to get a CA to issue to her a certificate that claims to represent Alice. That is, the certificate would publicly state that it represents Alice, and might include other information about Alice. Some of the information about Alice, such as her employer name, might be true, increasing the certificate&#x27;s credibility. Eve, however, would have the all-important private key associated with the certificate. Eve could then use the certificate to send a digitally signed email to Bob, tricking Bob into believing that the email was from Alice. Bob might even respond with encrypted email, believing that it could only be read by Alice, when Eve is actually able to decrypt it using the private key.

A notable case of CA subversion like this occurred in 2001, when the certificate authority VeriSign issued two certificates to a person claiming to represent Microsoft. The certificates have the name &quot;Microsoft Corporation&quot;, so they could be used to spoof someone into believing that updates to Microsoft software came from Microsoft when they actually did not. The fraud was detected in early 2001. Microsoft and VeriSign took steps to limit the impact of the problem.

In 2008, Comodo reseller Certstar sold a certificate for mozilla.com to Eddy Nigg, who had no authority to represent Mozilla.

In 2011 fraudulent certificates were obtained from Comodo and DigiNotar, allegedly by Iranian hackers. There is evidence that the fraudulent DigiNotar certificates were used in a man-in-the-middle attack in Iran.

In 2012, it became known that Trustwave issued a subordinate root certificate that was used for transparent traffic management (man-in-the-middle) which effectively permitted an enterprise to sniff SSL internal network traffic using the subordinate certificate.

In 2012, the Flame malware (also known as SkyWiper) contained modules that had an MD5 collision with a valid certificate issued by a Microsoft Terminal Server licensing certificate that used the broken MD5 hash algorithm. The authors thus was able to conduct a collision attack with the hash listed in the certificate.

In 2015, a Chinese certificate authority named MCS Holdings and affiliated with China&#x27;s central domain registry issued unauthorized certificates for Google domains. Google thus removed both MCS and the root certificate authority from Chrome and have revoked the certificates.

==Key storage==
An attacker who steals a certificate authority&#x27;s private keys is able to forge certificates as if they were CA, without needed ongoing access to the CA&#x27;s systems. Key theft is therefore one of the main risks certificate authorities defend against. Publicly trusted CAs almost always store their keys on a hardware security module (HSM), which allows them to sign certificates with a key, but generally prevent extraction of that key with both physical and software controls. CAs typically take the further precaution of keeping the key for their long-term root certificates in an HSM that is kept offline, except when it is needed to sign shorter-lived intermediate certificates. The intermediate certificates, stored in an online HSM, can do the day-to-day work of signing end-entity certificates and keeping revocation information up to date.

CAs sometimes use a key ceremony when generating signing keys, in order to ensure that the keys are not tampered with or copied.

==Implementation weakness of the trusted third party scheme==
The critical weakness in the way that the current X.509 scheme is implemented is that any CA trusted by a particular party can then issue certificates for any domain they choose. Such certificates will be accepted as valid by the trusting party whether they are legitimate and authorized or not. This is a serious shortcoming given that the most commonly encountered technology employing X.509 and trusted third parties is the HTTPS protocol. As all major web browsers are distributed to their end-users pre-configured with a list of trusted CAs that numbers in the dozens this means that any one of these pre-approved trusted CAs can issue a valid certificate for any domain whatsoever. The industry response to this has been muted. Given that the contents of a browser&#x27;s pre-configured trusted CA list is determined independently by the party that is distributing or causing to be installed the browser application there is really nothing that the CAs themselves can do.

This issue is the driving impetus behind the development of the DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) protocol. If adopted in conjunction with Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) DANE will greatly reduce if not eliminate the role of trusted third parties in a domain&#x27;s PKI.

<doc id="296374" wikidata="Q1074656" url="?curid=296374" title="Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea">
<text>The prime minister of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea () is Papua New Guinea&#x27;s head of government, consequent on being the leader of the party or coalition with majority support in the National Parliament. The prime minister serves as the head of his party, the head of the coalition government, and the chairman of the National Executive Council.

==History==
The office of Prime Minister was preceded by the Chief Minister.

===2011–2012 constitutional crisis===
From December 2011, the office was disputed between Peter O&#x27;Neill of the People&#x27;s National Congress Party and Sir Michael Somare of the National Alliance Party; the latter eventually supported O&#x27;Neill as Prime Minister on 3 August 2012, thus ending the constitutional crisis.

== Department of the Prime Minister ==
The Department of the Prime Minister has the task of providing administrative services to the restoration exercise as well as advising the Prime Minister and other government leaders. After a July 1995 cabinet reshuffle by Julius Chan, functions of the department were expanded.

==Office==
The office of the prime minister and other key government offices were initially located in Konedobu before being relocated to Waigani shortly after independence in 1975. Since April 2024, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office has been located at the newly-constructed Melanesia Haus, located opposite the main entrance to the National Parliament House.

<doc id="296377" wikidata="Q5682630" url="?curid=296377" title="Haunted Castle (2001 film)">
<text>Haunted Castle is a 2001 Belgian/American animated horror film in IMAX theaters. The film is rated PG and is computer-animated with 3D effects.

Written by Kurt Frey and directed by co-writer Ben Stassen, the film plays out very much like many modern video games, and can be divided into two types of segments: those in which the audience is seeing through the eyes of the main character, and those in which a scene plays out where the main character is actually in the shot.

==Plot==
A young, aspiring American musician and singer named Johnny has been notified by a British law firm that his mother, an aging rock star whom Johnny hasn&#x27;t seen or heard from since he was 3 years old, has died in a helicopter accident. Johnny has been willed her castle and all of her property and money, but he must visit the actual estate, located in England, to claim these things. As he drives up to the castle, a lightning bolt hits a grave on the castle grounds, and a glowing sphere emerges.

As Johnny enters the building, he walks through a hall with several suits of armor. The suits come alive and begin attacking him when suddenly a demonic entity speeds in, destroys the suits and beckons Johnny further into the castle. Johnny stumbles on a room of instruments levitating and playing on themselves, and then walks into a great hall with an orb embedded into the ground that begins projecting the image of Johnny&#x27;s mother. (This segues into a rather lengthy musical number in which this holographic image (Baertsoen) sings an operatic number while the cameras circle around her. The song is named &#x27;Lane Navachi&#x27; from Lunascape&#x27;s album &#x27;Reflecting Seylence&#x27;).

Suddenly, a demonic face appears in the fire. It is the Devil (referred to as &quot;Mr. D&quot;), who explains to Johnny that his mother sold her soul for her fame. Part of the agreement was that the devil could &quot;not touch&quot; Johnny, but now that she has died, Mr. D offers Johnny a similar agreement. Johnny declines, but is enticed to explore the castle further. He enters a cathedral-like room, whose floor begins to descend. Soon, Johnny is in Hell proper. At this point, the film begins to take a very dark and gothic turn, as Johnny&#x27;s tour guide, Mr. D&#x27;s chief lieutenant Mephisto, guides him through the sections of Hell where musicians who have sold their souls are violently tortured. Mephisto reveals that there was a time when luring people to Hell with fame in music was unsuccessful - until the invention of Rock and Roll.

Johnny is taken on a roller coaster ride through Hell, but as he proceeds, the glowing sphere - revealed to be the spirit of his mother - appears before him every now and then, warning him of the danger awaiting him should he give in to the Devil&#x27;s offer. Eventually, Johnny is sidetracked into a decrepit opera hall, where the worst of tortures are taking place. Mephisto reveals to Johnny that Mr. D once had a romance with an opera singer, who broke his heart, and now Mr. D has a particularly violent aversion for opera music.

Johnny eventually ends up back in front of Mr. D, who once again entices him to sign. Mephisto gives Johnny a guitar, and he considers the offer, then throws the guitar into the flames and begins to sing &quot;La Donna è Mobile&quot; at the top of his lungs, sending the Devil into a frenzied tantrum which collapses the entire castle. As this occurs, the soul of Johnny&#x27;s mother returns to its resting place once more.

The film jumps ahead six months later, and we see that Johnny is now a famous rock and roll star through his own talent. The last five minutes of the film features a performance by Arid, as the credits float by them in little bubbles burst by a floating demon.

==Cast==
*Jasper Steverlinck as Johnny. Steverlinck is the singer of the Belgian rock band Arid.
*Kyoko Baertsoen as Johnny&#x27;s mother. Baertsoen is the leader of another Belgian band, Lunascape.
*Harry Shearer as &quot;Mr. D&quot; and Mephisto

<doc id="296379" wikidata="Q474632" url="?curid=296379" title="Cairns Airport">
<text>Cairns Airport is an international airport in Cairns, Queensland, Australia. Formerly operated by the Cairns Port Authority, the airport was sold by the Queensland Government in December 2008 to a private consortium. It is the seventh busiest airport in Australia. The airport is located north northwest of Cairns or north of the Cairns central business district, in the suburb of Aeroglen. The airport lies between Mount Whitfield to the west and Trinity Bay to the east.

The airport has direct flights to 10 international and 35 domestic destinations and many general aviation flights including a number of helicopter operators. Flights are operated to all major Australian cities and tourist destinations, regional communities in Far North Queensland, and a number of international destinations in the Asia-Pacific region with connections to the rest of the world. The airport formed the main base for Australian Airlines prior to its ceasing of operations in June 2006 (the airport remains a major port for parent company Qantas). It is also a base for the Royal Flying Doctor Service and the search and rescue helicopters of the Queensland Government. In the 12 months ending 30 June 2019, Cairns Airport had just over 5 million passengers.

==History==
Cairns Airport goes back to 1928 when Tom McDonald started flying his de Havilland Gipsy Moth off a sand ridge near the present airport. He could only land and take off between high tides. During one emergency, McDonald was forced to take off from beer barrels.

During World War II, the Australian Government bought the airport for use by the Royal Australian Air Force. In 1943, the main runway was hard surfaced and lengthened to handle military aircraft. It was also used by the United States Army Air Forces as a transport base, with the 33d Troop Carrier Squadron (374th Troop Carrier Group) operating from the base during 1942. In 1949, the main runway was lengthened to to accommodate larger aircraft. During the mid-1960s, the airport was upgraded and the runway further lengthened to and strengthened so jets could land.

During the 1970s, Australia&#x27;s two domestic airlines Trans Australia Airlines and Ansett provided regular scheduled services to most Australian capital cities and also Papua New Guinea, while in 1975 Air Niugini became the first international airline to commence flights out of Cairns, to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea. In 1982, redevelopment of the airport commenced. This involved further lengthening of the runway to (making it the longest runway in Queensland) and construction of a new terminal building. The first stage of the redevelopment was finished in 1984 and a dual International and Domestic Terminal was opened. At the end of the decade the second stage of redevelopment was completed. This included a new separate International Terminal, associated aprons and taxiways, costing an estimated $80 million. The main runway was again extended, to . In 1997, the third stage of redevelopment was completed, during which a three-storey Airport Administration Centre was constructed providing of office space.

A$200 million redevelopment of the Domestic Terminal started in August 2007 and was completed in 2010. Check-in facilities were expanded into a common-user facility for all airlines, and the building enlarged. Five new jet bridges replaced the existing three old bridges. In January 2010, Auckland International Airport Limited announced that it had purchased 24.6 per cent of North Queensland Airports (NQA), operator of the airports at Cairns and Mackay, for about $132 million.

A further upgrade of the Domestic Terminal was begun in 2019 and completed in August 2020, at a total cost of $55 million. The purpose of the upgrade was to prepare the terminal to handle the domestic portion of the airport&#x27;s projected 6 million passengers annually from 2027. The floor area of the departure hall was increased to , and an additional of dining and retail facilities were added. The upgrade also included expanded seating areas, a new interactive children&#x27;s play screen, an upgraded Parenting Room, and a new Quiet Room.

Prior to February 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, Cairns Airport&#x27;s chief aviation officer Luis Perez told the Cairns Post that he was in talks with 22 airlines to connect Cairns to destinations such as North America, Korea, Taipei, Malaysia, the Middle East, India, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Virgin Australia announced in December of that same year that they would be commencing a daily direct service to Tokyo-Haneda to be launched on 28 June 2023 with the newly arrived Boeing 737 Max 8 fleet.

In early 2023, it was announced that the International Terminal (Terminal 1) would undergo its first major upgrade in April 2023 to a value of AUD$40–50 million. The announced upgrades would be rolled out in stages to &#x27;minimise passenger disruptions&#x27;, the first of which would feature the installation of four new glass air-bridges and the re-cladding of the exterior of the building.

In December 2023 the airport, like all of greater Cairns, was greatly affected by the severe weather during and in the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Jasper forcing it to close for several days. In March 2024 it was announced that both Cairns and Mackay Airports would run on 100% renewable energy sources from 2025.

==Facilities==

<doc id="296380" wikidata="Q1025095" url="?curid=296380" title="Yate">
<text>Yate is a town and civil parish in South Gloucestershire, England. It lies just to the southwest of the Cotswold Hills and is northeast of Bristol and from Bath.

Developing from a small village into a town from the 1950s onwards, the 2021 census listed Yate&#x27;s parish population as 23,703. The market town of Chipping Sodbury (population 5,045) is contiguous with Yate to the east. In addition, a large southern section of the built-up area spills over into the parish of Dodington (population 8,206), and as a result, the total population of Yate&#x27;s urban area is estimated at 35,000.

==Location==
Yate is located to the northeast of Bristol, which is away by road. Yate is surrounded by a vast amount of countryside and is situated to the south-west of the Cotswolds. The A432 is the main road through Yate and runs through the centre of the town.

==History==

The first mention of Yate is the existence of a religious house in about AD 770; Yate is also mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name is derived from the Old English word &quot;giete&quot; or &quot;gete&quot;, meaning &#x27;a gateway into a forest area&#x27;.

During the Anglo-Saxon period and well into medieval times, most of this part of south Gloucestershire was covered with forest. Through the centuries the land was cleared for farming.

The town&#x27;s parish church, St Mary&#x27;s, dates from Norman times. It was altered during the 15th century and was extensively restored in 1970. St Mary&#x27;s Primary School, situated outside the churchyard walls, was built on the site of a former poorhouse.

It was the opening of the railway station in 1844, as part of Bristol and Gloucester Railway, that established Yate, with Station Road becoming the central thoroughfare. The cattle and produce markets were held around this road, and businesses were established there. Yate railway station was closed by the Beeching cuts in January 1965, but was reopened in May 1989; the Brunel-built engine shed is preserved nearby.

Major growth in Yate started in the early 1920s with the construction of the Moorland Road estates behind Station Road, close to the Parnall aeroplane factory. In the 1950s the Ridge housing estate was developed. The area between these estates was still being mined for celestine and therefore could not be built on until the mineral had been extracted.

In the 1960s Yate was designated as a development area and the building boom began. The creation of a new town included a large retail shopping area, sports and leisure development together with public buildings.

In the 1960s the area around Stanshawes was exhausted of celestine and the housing boom started with the major construction taking place in the south. Much of this development was planned using the Radburn model, a design that created a vehicle-free environment by the use of green spaces and linking paths at the front of the houses. This model was used until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the planners reverted to traditional street design methods for the development of the remainder of North Yate, Brimsham Park and the Newmans factory site.

When a secondary school was built in the late 1970s, it was supposed to be called Brinsham Green School, after Brinsham Lane at nearby Yate Rocks. Owing to a spelling error, however, it was in fact called Brimsham Green School. The town further expanded in the 1990s and 2000s with the construction of housing at North Yate. This housing estate continued to use the corrupted name of Brimsham. To locals the area is known as Brimsham Park.

===Yate railway yard===
During the Second World War, a railway transfer yard was constructed for the United States Army, probably as part of Operation Bolero to assist the buildup of troops and stores before D-Day. Two large storage sheds survived on the site until 2008.

At the end of the Second World War, the site was taken over by the Royal Navy and became known as the Sea Transport Stores Depot. It was occupied by the Highways Agency until the sheds were demolished for development.

Oxford Archaeology has been commissioned to undertake an investigation as to the military significance of this site. The opinion of Bristol Industrial Archaeological Society has also been sought.

==Administration==
Yate is represented in the UK Parliament by the constituency of Thornbury and Yate.
 Historically part of Gloucestershire until 1974 it then became part of the district of Northavon within the newly formed county of Avon. In 1996, Avon was abolished, and the area became part of the unitary authority of South Gloucestershire and rejoined the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire. Yate Town Council provides local services, which are displayed on their website.

==Industry==
Before the Second World War, Yate had an aircraft manufacturing industry (Parnall) with a grass aerodrome. During the Second World War, Parnall specialised in making gun turrets. A number of people were killed in raids by the Luftwaffe on the factory in February and March 1941.

Following the war, the Parnall factory turned to the manufacture of domestic goods and was famous for its washing machines. In 1958 Parnall merged with Radiation Ltd to become known as Jackson, producing the Jackson range of cookers. Through mergers and acquisitions, Jacksons is now part of Indesit and the Jackson name is no longer used.

Newman&#x27;s of Bristol had a large factory on Station Road, from 1932 until the 1980s, in its heyday in the 1960s, employing over 1,500 people.

Yate has had three natural products associated with it: limestone to the east, celestine or spar near the centre of the town and coal to the west.

The need for limestone increased with the growth of roads, while the demand for coal grew with the diminishing supply of timber. Celestine, the major strontium mineral, was first dug in the late 1880s and was initially used for the refining of sugar beet. At one time Yate&#x27;s celestine accounted for 95 per cent of the world&#x27;s production. It colours flames red, and so was important for pyrotechnics such as fireworks, military and signal flares and tracer bullets. The last commercial excavation of celestine from the Yate area was for use during the Vietnam War. The mining company, Bristol Mineral and Land Co, closed in 1994.

==Amenities==

The town has a skatepark at Peghill. Yate Common on Westerleigh Road is used for dog walking, nature watching, kite flying, circuses and fairs.

The common has a stretch of unused dual carriageway (), known as the &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot;, which has been used for filming in TV programmes such as &quot;Casualty&quot;. This was part of a scheme to create a bypass from Rodford Way in South Yate to Nibley. The scheme was only partially completed in 1974, the year when Yate became a part of Avon. Completion of the road would have entailed building a bridge over the railway, but finance for this was never made available. The town has several parks and areas of open space. The largest of these is Kingsgate Park, which has an adventure playground for children. The town is served by a community radio station, GLOSS FM which broadcasts 365 days a year on its webcasts and twice a year on 87.7 MHz FM. A Cineworld cinema opened in the new Riverside shopping centre in April 2016. The town benefits from a four appliance fire station, with a retained Crew 24 hours and then further tenders staffed on a voluntary basis. Next to the fire station is a 6 bay ambulance station with a further 3 ambulances and 2 response cars stabled outside.
Construction of a pedestrianised shopping centre of around a hundred shops began in the early-to-mid-1960s. The shopping centre was opened by Patricia Phoenix, Mary Rand and Ted Ray. As in most British new towns, modern art was incorporated, in the form of the Four Seasons sculpture, and a spire-shaped sculpture, which could be seen for miles. This sculpture existed until the early 1990s when it was removed during the revamping of the centre, which included the erection of glass roofs over the walkways. An extension to East Walk was constructed at the start of the 1980s, and an extension to West Walk was constructed in the early 1990s. During the 1980s and into the mid-1990s, the shopping centre hosted Yate&#x27;s annual festival. On opening day a celebrity launched the festival by releasing balloons. In December 2006, the owners of the shopping centre (Dominion Corporate Trustees) announced plans to enlarge and modernise it.

<text>Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de León (; born 27 December 1951) is a Mexican economist and politician. He was the 61st president of Mexico from 1994 to 2000, as the last of the uninterrupted 71-year line of Mexican presidents from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).

During his presidency, he faced one of the worst economic crises in Mexico&#x27;s history, which started only weeks after taking office. While he distanced himself from his predecessor Carlos Salinas de Gortari, blaming his administration for the crisis, and overseeing the arrest of Salinas&#x27; brother Raúl Salinas de Gortari, he continued the neoliberal policies of his two predecessors. His administration was also marked by renewed clashes with the EZLN and the Popular Revolutionary Army; the controversial implementation of Fobaproa to rescue the national banking system; a political reform that allowed residents of the Federal District (Mexico City) to elect their own mayor; the privatization of national railways and its subsequent suspension of the passenger rail service; and the Aguas Blancas and Acteal massacres perpetrated by State forces.

Although Zedillo&#x27;s policies eventually led to a relative economic recovery, popular discontent with seven decades of PRI rule led to the party losing, for the first time, its legislative majority in the 1997 midterm elections, and in the 2000 general election the right-wing opposition National Action Party&#x27;s candidate Vicente Fox won the Presidency of the Republic, putting an end to 71 years of uninterrupted PRI rule. Zedillo&#x27;s admission of the PRI&#x27;s defeat and his peaceful handing of power to his successor improved his image in the final months of his administration, and he left office with an approval rating of 60%.

Since the end of his term as president, Zedillo has been a leading voice on globalization, especially its impact on relations between developed and developing nations. He is currently the director of the Center for the Study of Globalization at Yale University and is on the board of directors at the Inter-American Dialogue and Citigroup.

==Early life and education==
Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de León was born on 27 December 1951 in Mexico City. His parents were Rodolfo Zedillo Castillo, a mechanic, and Martha Alicia Ponce de León. Seeking better job and education opportunities for their children, his parents moved to Mexicali, Baja California.

In 1964, at the age of 13, he returned to Mexico City. In 1969 he entered the National Polytechnic Institute, financing his studies by working in the National Army and Navy Bank (later known as &quot;Banjército&quot;). He graduated as an economist in 1972 and began lecturing. It was among his first group of students that he met his wife, Nilda Patricia Velasco, with whom he has five children: Ernesto, Emiliano, Carlos (formerly married to conductor Alondra de la Parra), Nilda Patricia and Rodrigo.

In 1974, he pursued his master&#x27;s and PhD studies at Yale University. His doctoral thesis was titled &quot;Mexico&#x27;s Public External Debt: Recent History and Future Growth Related to Oil&quot;.

===Political career===
Zedillo began working in the Bank of Mexico (Mexico&#x27;s central bank) as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, where he supported the adoption of macroeconomic policies for the country&#x27;s improvement. By 1987, he was named deputy secretary of Planning and Budget Control in the Secretariat of Budget and Planning. In 1988, at the age of 38, he headed that secretariat. During his term as Secretary, Zedillo launched a Science and Technology reform and served in this capacity for three years until December 1991.

In 1992, he was appointed Secretary of Education by president Carlos Salinas. During his tenure in this post, he was in charge of the revision of Mexican public school textbooks. The changes, which took a softer line on foreign investment and the Porfiriato, among other topics, were highly controversial and the textbooks were withdrawn. A year later, he resigned to run the electoral campaign of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI&#x27;s presidential candidate.

==1994 presidential campaign==

In 1994, after Colosio&#x27;s assassination, Zedillo became one of the few PRI members eligible under Mexican law to take his place, since he had not occupied public office for some time.

The opposition blamed Colosio&#x27;s murder on Salinas. Although the PRI&#x27;s presidential candidates were always chosen by the current president, and thus Colosio had originally been Salinas&#x27; candidate, their political relationship had been affected by a famous speech during the campaign in which Colosio said that Mexico had many problems. It is also notable that the assassination took place after Colosio visited the members of the Zapatista movement in Chiapas and promised to open dialogue, something the PRI opposed.

After Colosio&#x27;s murder, this speech was seen as the main cause of his break with the president. The choice of Zedillo was interpreted as Salinas&#x27; way of bypassing the strong Mexican political tradition of non-reelection and retaining real power since Zedillo was not a politician, but an economist (like Salinas), who lacked the president&#x27;s political talent and influence. It is unclear if Salinas had attempted to control Colosio, who was generally considered at that time to be a far better candidate.

Zedillo ran against Diego Fernández de Cevallos of the National Action Party and second-timer Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas of the Party of the Democratic Revolution. He won with 48.69% of the popular vote and became the last president to distinguish the 70-year PRI dynasty in México during the 20th century.

==Presidency (1994–2000)==
At age 42, Zedillo assumed the presidency on 1 December 1994 at the Legislative Palace of San Lázaro, taking oath before the Congress of the Union presided by the deputy president Carlota Vargas Garza. Zedillo&#x27;s electoral victory was perceived as clean, but he came to office as an accidental candidate with no political base of his own and no experience. During the first part of his presidency, he took inconsistent policy positions and there were rumours that he would resign or that there would be a coup d&#x27;état against him, which caused turmoil in financial markets.

===Cabinet===
Zedillo&#x27;s cabinet needed to have members who could deal with crises. Throughout his presidency, he had four as Minister of the Interior, Esteban Moctezuma, who dealt with the Zapatistas; Emilio Chuayffet, who resigned following the Acteal massacre; Francisco Labastida, who won the primary to determine the 2000 PRI presidential candidate; and Diódoro Carrasco Altamirano, who dealt with the strike at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

===Financial crisis of December 1994===

A few days after Zedillo had taken office, one of the biggest economic crises in Mexican history hit the country. Although it was outgoing President Salinas who was mainly blamed for the crisis, Salinas claimed that President Zedillo made a mistake by changing the economic policies held by his administration. Zedillo devalued the peso by 15%, which prompted the near collapse of the financial system. The crisis ended after a series of reforms and actions led by Zedillo. US president Bill Clinton granted a US$20 billion loan to Mexico, which helped in one of Zedillo&#x27;s initiatives to rescue the banking system.

===Break with Salinas===
Zedillo had been an accidental presidential candidate who was vaulted to prominence with the assassination of Colosio. The conflict between Zedillo and Salinas marked the early part of Zedillo&#x27;s presidency. As with De la Madrid and Salinas, Zedillo had never been elected to office and had no experience in politics. His performance as a candidate was lacklustre, but the outbreak of violence in Chiapas and the shock of the Colosio assassination swayed voters to support the PRI candidate in the 1994 election. In office, Zedillo was perceived as a puppet president with Salinas following the model of Plutarco Elías Calles in the wake of the 1928 assassination of president-elect Alvaro Obregón. In order to consolidate his own power in the presidency, Zedillo had to assert his independence from Salinas. On 28 February 1995 Zedillo ordered the arrest of the ex-president&#x27;s older brother Raúl Salinas for the September 1994 murder of PRI General Secretary José Francisco Ruiz Massieu. This action marked a decisive break between Zedillo and Salinas.

===Zapatista crisis===

Mexico had been in turmoil since January 1994, with the initial Zapatista rebellion and two political assassinations. The presidential candidate Colosio of the PRI was assassinated in March 1994, and his campaign manager Ernesto Zedillo then became the candidate a few days later. The other high-profile assassination, that of PRI Secretary General José Francisco Ruiz Massieu, brother-in-law of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in September 1994, laid bare political rivalries within the PRI. In order to give credibility to the investigations of those political crimes and grant &quot;a healthy distance&quot;, President Zedillo appointed Antonio Lozano Gracia a member of the opposition Political Party PAN as Attorney General of Mexico. Zedillo inherited the rebellion in Chiapas, but it was up to his administration to handle it.

On 5 January 1995, the Secretary of Interior Esteban Moctezuma started a secret meeting process with Marcos called &quot;Steps Toward Peace&quot; Chiapas. Talks seemed promising for an agreement, but Zedillo backed away, apparently because the military was not in accord with the government&#x27;s apparent &quot;acceptance of the Zapatistas&#x27; control over much of Chiapas territory.&quot; In February 1995, the Mexican government identified the masked Subcomandante Marcos as Rafael Sebastián Guillén, a former professor at the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana in Mexico City. Metaphorically unmasking Marcos and identifying him as a non-indigenous urban intellectual turned-terrorist of was the government&#x27;s attempt to demystify and delegitimize the Zapatistas in public opinion. The army was prepared to move against Zapatista strongholds and capture Marcos. The government decided to reopen negotiations with the Zapatistas. On 10 March 1995 President Zedillo and Secretary of the Interior Moctezuma signed the Presidential Decree for the Dialog, the Reconciliation and a peace with dignity in Chiapas law, which was discussed and approved by the Mexican Congress. In April 1995, the government and the Zapatistas began secret talks to find an end to the conflict. In February 1996, the San Andrés Accords were signed by the government and the Zapatistas. In May 1996, Zapatistas imprisoned for terrorism were released. In December 1997, indigenous peasants were murdered in an incident known as the Acteal massacre. Survivors of the massacre sued Zedillo in U.S., but the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the suit based on his immunity as a head of state.

===Church-state relations===

Salinas had gained the support of the Roman Catholic Church in the 1988 elections and had pushed through a series of constitutional changes that significantly changed church-state relations. However, on 11 February 1995, Zedillo ignited a crisis with the Roman Catholic Church, hurting, recently restored Mexico–Holy See diplomatic relations. Relations had already been damaged because of 24 May 1993 political assassination of the Guadalajara Cardinal Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo and lack of government progress on solving the murder by the Attorney General of Mexico. The PGR pressured the bishop of Chiapas, Samuel Ruiz García for supposedly concealing the Zapatistas guerrilla activity. Ruiz&#x27;s involvement had been strategic and an important instrument to keep the peace after the EZLN uprising.

===Poverty alleviation===
Zedillo&#x27;s presidential motto was &quot;Bienestar para tu familia&quot; (&quot;Well-being for your family&quot;). He created the poverty alleviation program &quot;Progresa&quot;, which subsidized the poorest families in Mexico, provided that their children went to school. It replaced the Salinas administration&#x27;s PRONASOL, deemed too politicized. It was later renamed &quot;Oportunidades&quot; (&quot;Opportunities&quot;) by president Vicente Fox. The parastatal organization CONASUPO, which was designed to supply food and provide food security to the poor was phased out in 1999, resulting in higher food prices.

===NAFTA and other economic measures===

Carlos Salinas had negotiated Mexico&#x27;s place in NAFTA, which took effect in January 1994, so Zedillo was the first president to oversee it for his entire term. The Mexican economy suffered following the December 1994 peso crisis, when the currency was devalued by 15% and the U.S. intervened to prop up the economy with a multi-billion dollar loan so that NAFTA under the Zedillo administration got off to a rocky start. The Mexican GDP was -7% and there were hopes that NAFTA would lift that miserable performance statistic.

In the run-up to the implementation of NAFTA, Salinas had privatized hundreds of companies. During the Zedillo administration, he privatized the state railway company, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México. This led to the suspension of passenger service in 1997.

===Electoral reform===

Zedillo saw electoral reform as a key issue for his administration. In January 1995, Zedillo initiated multiparty talks about electoral reform, which resulted in an agreement on how to frame political reform. In July 1996, those talks resulted in the agreement of Mexico&#x27;s four major parties on a reform package, which was ratified unanimously in the legislature. It created autonomous organizations to oversee elections, made the post of Head of Government of Mexico City, previously an appointed position, into an elective one, as of July 1997, and created closer oversight of campaign spending. &quot;Perhaps most crucially, it represents a first step toward consensus among the parties on a set of mutually accepted democratic rules of the game.&quot; The reforms lowered the influence of the PRI and opened opportunities for other parties. In the 1997 elections, for the first time the PRI did not win the majority in Congress. Zedillo was also a strong advocate of federalism as a counterbalance to a centralized system.

===Foreign relations===
Zedillo sought to forge new ties overseas, including ones with China. He made a rhetorical gesture to Africa, but without real effect.

He successfully concluded negotiations with the European Union for a Free Trade Agreement, which entered into force in July 2000 

===Approval ratings===

In terms of its approval ratings, the Zedillo administration was a very unusual one in Mexican politics in that, while normally Presidents are highly popular upon taking office and don&#x27;t experience serious downturns in their approval rate during their first year in office, Zedillo dealt with very low approval ratings merely weeks after taking office due to his decision to devaluate the Peso on 20 December 1994, giving way to the Mexican peso crisis that severely hit the national economy.

Hitting a bottom low 24% approval on 3 January 1995, Zedillo continued to experience low approval ratings throughout 1995, with the effects of the economic crisis, the continuing conflict with the EZNL in Chiapas and the Aguas Blancas massacre in June preventing his popularity from recovering. Although not as troublesome as in 1995, his approval ratings remained unsteady during 1996.

Zedillo&#x27;s approval ratings, however, experienced a steady growth beginning in January 1997, and for the rest of his administration, his disapproval rate was never higher than his approval rate. Helped in no doubt by the relative economic recovery and the peaceful transfer of power to Vicente Fox (who won the 2000 presidential elections, being the first opposition candidate in 71 years to defeat the ruling PRI), Zedillo left office with an approval rate of 64% and a disapproval rate of 25.4%.

On average, Zedillo&#x27;s administration had an approval rating of 55.3% and a disapproval rating of 34.3%.

An interesting occurrence is that of the aforementioned 3 January 1995 poll: at the same time that Zedillo recorded his lowest-ever approval rate and a disapproval rate of 30%, 46.1% of those polled either stated that they didn&#x27;t have an opinion on his administration or didn&#x27;t answer, making it the only case ever recorded in Mexican modern history in which a plurality expressed no opinion on a sitting President.

Highest approval ratings:
*15 October 1997 (74.8% approval).
*1 September 1997 (71.4% approval).
*1 July 1998 (71.3% approval).

Lowest approval ratings:
*3 January 1995 (24% approval).
*16 January 1995 (31.4% approval).
*1 February 1995 (35.7% approval).

Highest disapproval ratings:
*17 November 1995 (49.8% disapproval).
*2 May 1995 (48.8% disapproval).
*1 March 1995 (45.9% disapproval).

Lowest disapproval ratings:
*6 December 1994 (6.5% disapproval).
*15 December 1994 (7.2% disapproval).
*15 October 1997 (18.2% disapproval).

==2000 election==

The presidential election of 2 July 2000 was a watershed in Mexican history for several reasons. The PRI presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida was not designated by the sitting president (as all former presidential nominees from the PRI had been until that point), but by an open internal primary of the party. Changes in the electoral rules meant that the government did not control voting as it had previously in the Ministry of the Interior. Elections were now the jurisdiction of the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), with Mexicans having faith that elections would be free and fair. IFE implemented new procedures regarding campaigns and balloting, with rules for finance, guarantee of the secret ballot, and unbiased counting of votes. Also important were some 10,000 Mexican poll watchers and over 850 foreign observers, including ex-president of the U.S., Jimmy Carter. Zapatista leader Subcomandante Marcos declared that the election was a &quot;dignified and respectable battleground.&quot; The results of the election were even more historic. For the first time since the founding of Zedillo&#x27;s party in 1929, an opposition candidate won, a peaceful change from an authoritarian government. Zedillo went on national television when the polls closed, declaring that Vicente Fox had won. In Fox&#x27;s autobiography he writes, &quot;There are still those old-guard &quot;priistas&quot; who consider Ernesto Zedillo a traitor to his class for his actions on the night of 2 July 2000, as the party boss who betrayed the machine. But in that moment, President Zedillo became a true democrat... In minutes, he preempted any possibility of violent resistance from hard-line &quot;priistas&quot;. It was an act of electoral integrity that will forever mark the mild-mannered economist as a historic figure of Mexico&#x27;s peaceful transition to democracy.&quot;

==Post-presidency==

Since leaving office, Zedillo has held many jobs as an economic consultant in many international companies and organizations. He currently is on the faculty at Yale University, where he teaches economics and heads the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization. In 2008, a conference on global climate change was convened at Yale, resulting in a published volume edited by Zedillo.

According to a 2012 &quot;Economist&quot; article, a group of ten anonymous Tzotzil people claiming to be survivors of the Acteal massacre have taken an opportunity to sue former President Zedillo in a civil court in Connecticut, &quot;seeking about $50 million and a declaration of guilt against Mr Zedillo.&quot; The victims of the massacre were members of an indigenous rights group known as Las Abejas; however, the current president of that organization, Porfirio Arias, claims that the alleged victims were not residents of Acteal at all. This has led commentators to allege the trial to be politically motivated, perhaps by a member of his own political party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, angry about Zedillo&#x27;s reforms that led to the party losing power in the 2000 Mexican presidential election, after 71 years of continuous political rule.

The United States Department of State recommended that President Zedillo be granted immunity from prosecution due to the actions occurring as part of his official capacity as head of state. This motion is not binding in the US court system, but judges &quot;generally side with the State Department.&quot;

The plaintiffs, who are being represented by Rafferty, Kobert, Tenenholtz, Bounds &amp; Hess may appeal the ruling of U.S. District Judge Michael Shea to sidestep the immunity Zedillo has been granted.

In 2014, the US Supreme Court refused to hear a case against Zedillo on grounds of &quot;sovereign immunity&quot; as a former head of state by survivors of the Acteal massacre.

==Public opinion and legacy==
In a national survey conducted in 2012 by BGC-Excélsior regarding former Presidents, 39% of the respondents considered that the Zedillo administration was &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;good&quot;, 27% responded that it was an &quot;average&quot; administration, and 31% responded that it was a &quot;very bad&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; administration.

<text>Lucille Frances Lawless (; born 29 March 1968) is a New Zealand actress and director. She is best known for her roles as Xena in the television series &quot;&quot;, as D&#x27;Anna Biers on the re-imagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; series, and Lucretia in the television series &quot;&quot; and associated series. Since 2019, she has starred as Alexa in the television series &quot;My Life Is Murder&quot;.

Lawless had recurring roles as Diane Lewis-Swanson on the NBC sitcom &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; (2012–2014), and as Countess Palatine Ingrid Von Marburg on the WGN America supernatural series &quot;Salem&quot; (2015). She also starred as Ruby on the Starz horror-comedy series &quot;Ash vs Evil Dead&quot; (2015–2018).

== Early life and education==
Lucille Frances &quot;Lucy&quot; Ryan was born on 29 March 1968 in the Auckland suburb of Mount Albert to teacher Julie Ryan (née Haynes) and Mount Albert&#x27;s mayor, banker Frank Ryan. She is the fifth of six siblings (four brothers and one sister). She has described her family as &quot;this big, sprawling Irish Catholic family&quot;, and while filming in Ireland for the Discovery Channel in 2004, told &quot;Ireland on Sunday&quot; that her father&#x27;s family originated in Quilty, County Clare, Ireland.

Her first musical was at age 10 and she began acting in secondary school. She attended Marist College, Auckland, and began studies at Auckland University in languages. At 18, she went on her &quot;overseas experience&quot;, travelling through Europe and Australia with her future husband, Garth Lawless. At 21, she won the 1989 Mrs New Zealand competition.

Lawless has said she suffered from bulimia as a child, but was able to overcome the illness.

== Acting career ==
Lawless&#x27;s television debut was in the New Zealand sketch-comedy series, &quot;Funny Business&quot;. Then she studied drama at the William Davis Centre for Actors Study in Vancouver, Canada.

In 1994, Lawless appeared in &quot;Hercules and the Amazon Women&quot;, that became the television pilot for &quot;&quot;. In that episode, she played a man-hating Amazon named Lysia. She went on to play another character, Lyla, in the first-season episode &quot;As Darkness Falls&quot;.

=== &quot;Xena: Warrior Princess&quot; ===
Lawless received her best-known role as a heroic warrior woman named Xena in the first season of &quot;Hercules&quot;. She first appeared in the episode &quot;The Warrior Princess&quot; which aired in March 1995. R. J. Stewart dramatised the teleplay from a story that Robert G. &quot;Rob&quot; Tapert commissioned John Schulian to write. The character became a fan favourite. Vanessa Angel was originally cast in the role, but she fell ill and was unable to travel to New Zealand for shooting. To differentiate between Xena and the similar Lysia, Lawless&#x27;s hair, previously an ash blonde, was dyed black. She also wore a much darker costume. Lawless returned as Xena in two more episodes of the first season of &quot;Hercules&quot;, which portrayed her turn from villainess to a good, heroic character.

The character was popular enough that a spin-off series was created: &quot;&quot; debuted on 4 September 1995. &quot;Xena: Warrior Princess&quot;, like its parent programme, was a huge hit and achieved high ratings and cultural significance, lasting six seasons. The series brought Lawless an immense amount of attention and she became an international celebrity.

While taping an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; in October 1996, Lawless suffered a fractured pelvis when the horse she was riding lost its footing in the studio car park. She made a complete recovery, but several episodes of the second season of &quot;Xena&quot; were rewritten to focus on background characters to minimise the time Lawless was needed on set.

=== Other acting work ===
Lawless first appeared on Broadway in September 1997 in the &quot;Grease&quot; revival, as the &quot;bad girl&quot; character Betty Rizzo. She wanted to play the lead role of Sandy and later stated her belief that the producers typecast her to play &quot;bad girls&quot; following her success as Xena. She said the Sandy character was very similar to her sheltered childhood, growing up in New Zealand with many protective older brothers.

From 2005 to 2009, she had a recurring role in the television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. Lawless appeared as D&#x27;Anna Biers, a reporter with the Fleet News Service who worked on a critical documentary about the crew of the &quot;Galactica&quot; and was later revealed to be Humanoid Cylon model Number Three.

Lawless has also performed as a voice actor in several animated features: In 2008, Lawless voiced the animated character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman in the direct-to-video superhero animated film &quot;Justice League: The New Frontier&quot;, adapted from the DC Comics limited series. In 2014, Lawless voiced the militaristic &quot;Queen of the Ants&quot; in the American animated television series &quot;Adventure Time&quot; on the Cartoon Network.

In 2007, Lawless was to appear as one of the leads in the ensemble cast of the ABC television series, &quot;Football Wives&quot;, based on the popular British series &quot;Footballers&#x27; Wives&quot;. The series did not continue past the pilot episode, but the network extended the options on its contracts with Lawless and the other actors slated to star in the series, including Gabrielle Union, Kiele Sanchez, Ving Rhames, and James Van Der Beek.

Lawless returned to television on 10 November 2008 in a guest-starring role on the CBS television series &quot;&quot;, in a Season 7 episode, &quot;Cheating Death&quot;, playing a madam with connections to a murder and helping Horatio &quot;H&quot; Caine with his inquiries.

In 2009, Lawless appeared in two episodes of the final season of &quot;The L Word&quot; as Sergeant Marybeth Duffy. She played a role in the Adam Sandler film &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; released December 2008. Also in 2008, Lawless appeared with her former &quot;Xena&quot; stuntwoman Zoë Bell in Sony (Crackle)&#x27;s new web series &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, written by Ed Brubaker, which debuted online in early 2009. In 2009, Lawless guest-starred in the HBO series &quot;Flight of the Conchords&quot; as Paula, assistant to the Prime Minister of New Zealand.

Lawless co-starred in the Starz original series &quot;&quot;. The show was based on the life of Spartacus, the famous gladiator, and the slave revolt he led, and was produced by long-time &quot;Xena&quot; producers Sam Raimi and &quot;Rob&quot; Tapert, her own husband. Lawless played the role of Lucretia, the wife of Lentulus Batiatus, who were both the owners of a gladiator ludus, which also saw Lawless doing nude scenes for the first time. Lawless won the 2011 Saturn Award as Best Supporting Actress for her role as Lucretia in &quot;Spartacus: Blood and Sand&quot;. Lawless reprised her role as Lucretia in &quot;&quot;, which chronicled life in the Ludus before Spartacus&#x27;s arrival, and she also returned for the sequel &quot;&quot;.

Lawless provided the voice of Goldmoon for &quot;&quot;, a direct-to-DVD animated film based on the novel of the same name. From 2012 to 2014, she had a recurring role on the NBC series &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; as Diane, the love interest and eventual wife of Ron Swanson.

In 2014, Lawless guest-starred in &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; as Isabelle Hartley in the season two premiere, and reprised the role later in episode 15 of season two, &quot;One Door Closes&quot;. In 2015, Lawless landed the recurring guest role of Countess Palatine Ingrid Von Marburg in WGN America&#x27;s &quot;Salem&quot;. Countess Marburg is presented as one of the last remaining survivors of the legendary line of ancient German witches. The series ended in 2017. In March 2015, it was announced that she would be portraying the role of Ruby in Starz horror-comedy series &quot;Ash vs Evil Dead&quot;. The series ended in 2018.

In 2019, Lawless began playing Alexa Crowe, a private investigator in &quot;My Life Is Murder&quot;. The Acorn TV series began in 2019 and reached its third season in 2022.

==Filmmaking==
In 2023, Lawless co-wrote and directed &quot;Never Look Away&quot;, a film based on the life of New Zealand-born CNN photojournalist and camerawoman Margaret Moth. The film had its world premiere in the World Cinema Documentary Competition section of the 40th Sundance Film Festival in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah, in January 2024, and has gone on to feature at several other film festivals in 2024.

== Music ==

Lawless, who has a background in musical theatre, played Betty Rizzo on Broadway in a production of &quot;Grease&quot; in 1997. She continued to sing during the run of &quot;Xena&quot;, even contributing dirge music of her own composition; this made it into the episode &quot;The Path Not Taken&quot; as the dirge &quot;Burial&quot;, which she sang for the first time in the episode. Two musically-oriented episodes, &quot;The Bitter Suite&quot; and &quot;Lyre, Lyre, Heart&#x27;s on Fire&quot;, also showcased not only her singing but also that of some of her castmates. (&quot;See also&quot; List of &quot;Xena: Warrior Princess&quot; episodes &quot;for details&quot;.)

Lawless was encouraged to resume her singing career after being a contestant on &quot;Celebrity Duets&quot;, which she finished as runner-up to Alfonso Ribeiro. She made her solo debut at the Roxy in Hollywood, a venue of 500 seats, on 13 January 2007, with a sold-out crowd for consecutive concerts.

== LGBT rights icon ==

Xena&#x27;s ambiguous romantic relationship with travelling companion Gabrielle (Renee O&#x27;Connor) led to Lawless becoming a lesbian icon, a role of which she has said she is proud. She has said that during the years she was playing the role, she had been undecided on the nature of the relationship, but in a 2003 interview with &quot;Lesbian News&quot; magazine, she said that after viewing the series finale, she had come to see Xena and Gabrielle&#x27;s relationship as definitely gay, adding &quot;they&#x27;re married, man&quot;. This reputation became cemented after her &quot;graphic lesbian sex scenes&quot; in &quot;&quot;. She has appeared at gay pride events such as the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.

For her support of LGBT rights, including her public support for same-sex marriage, Lawless was given the Star 100–Ally of the Year award at the Australian LGBTI Awards ceremony in 2017.

==Other activities==
Lawless is a member of the board of trustees of the StarShip Foundation, the charity arm of the Starship Children&#x27;s Health which is part of the Auckland District Health Board. It is set up to provide additional equipment, support and help to staff, patients and families. She helps fundraising for the organisation. In 2008, she sat for the New Zealand television series &quot;The Sitting&quot;, an arts series where celebrity portraits are produced during an interview session, with the portraits later auctioned for charity.

Since 2006, 21 September marks &quot;Lucy Lawless Feel the Love Day/Week&quot;. The day, organised by the Official Lucy Lawless Fan Club, begins a week of charitable acts and donations by fans in honour and support of Lawless.

In May 2009 Lawless became a &quot;climate ambassador&quot; for the Greenpeace &quot;Sign On&quot; campaign.

In February 2012, she and six other Greenpeace activists boarded an oil drilling ship at Port Taranaki, and remained on it for 77 hours to stop it leaving for the Arctic where it was going to take part in oil exploration. She was subsequently arrested and charged with burglary, which carried an imprisonment term of up to 10 years if convicted. She pleaded guilty on 14 June 2012 to trespass charges regarding the February incident. Lawless said she intended for now to remain involved with Greenpeace. In February 2013, Lawless and the other six activists were each sentenced to pay a fine of NZ$651 and undertake 120 hours of community service. The judge denied the NZ$545,000 in reparations that Shell Todd Oil Services had sought from the activists. Following the sentencing, Lawless said: &quot;I consider it a great victory that the court has struck down the reparation demand from Shell, which I think was absolutely ludicrous.&quot;

== Personal life ==

In 1988, she became pregnant from her boyfriend Garth Lawless while working with him in the Australian outback. They married in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, that year, then returned to New Zealand where their daughter was born. They divorced in 1995.

On 28 March 1998, Lawless married &quot;Xena&#x27;s&quot; executive producer, Pacific Renaissance Pictures CEO Robert Tapert at St. Monica Catholic Church in Santa Monica, California. They have two sons.

==Recognition and awards==
In the 2004 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Lawless was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to entertainment and the community.

Astronomer Michael E. Brown nicknamed his newly discovered dwarf planet &quot;Xena&quot; in 2003, its then-provisional designation being . When this object was initially determined to be larger than Pluto, it gained international attention and forced a year-long debate among astronomers as to the definition of a planet. Observations made by New Horizons subsequently found Pluto to be marginally larger than the object, which was ultimately named Eris. The object&#x27;s nickname &quot;Xena&quot; was used in the press. &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine polled the public on their preferred final name for the so-called tenth planet; &quot;Xena&quot; ranked number 4. Lawless called Brown in December 2005 to thank him for his &quot;senseless act of beauty&quot;, and claimed that she &quot;never dared hope [the name] would stick&quot;. Eventually, Xena and Pluto were deemed not to be true planets, and were instead classified as dwarf planets. In 2006, the dwarf planet nicknamed Xena was officially named Eris. However, Brown made an indirect tribute to Lawless by naming Eris&#x27;s moon Dysnomia after the Greek goddess of lawlessness.

<doc id="296389" wikidata="Q6649200" url="?curid=296389" title="Little Bo-Peep">
<text>&quot;Little Bo-Peep&quot; or &quot;Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep&quot; is a popular English language nursery rhyme. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 6487.

==Lyrics and melody==
As with most products of oral tradition, there are many variations to the rhyme. The most common modern version is:

:Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep,
:And doesn&#x27;t know where to find them;
:Leave them alone, and they&#x27;ll come home,
:Wagging their tails behind them.


Common variations on the second line include &quot;And can&#x27;t tell where to find them.&quot; The fourth line is frequently given as &quot;Bringing their tails behind them&quot;, or sometimes &quot;Dragging their tails behind them&quot;. This alternative version is useful in the extended version, usually of four further stanzas. The melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first recorded in 1870 by the composer and nursery rhyme collector James William Elliott in his &quot;National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs&quot;.

==Additional verses==
The following additional verses are often added to the rhyme:

:Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep,
:and dreamt she heard them bleating;
:but when she awoke, she found it a joke,
:for they were still a-fleeting.

:Then up she took her little crook,
:determined for to find them;
:she found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,
:for they&#x27;d left their tails behind them.

:It happened one day, as Bo-Peep did stray
:into a meadow hard by,
:there she espied their tails side by side,
:all hung on a tree to dry.

:She heaved a sigh and wiped her eye,
:and over the hillocks went rambling,
:and tried what she could, as a shepherdess should,
:to tack each again to its lambkin.

This is an allusion of the common practice of &quot;docking&quot; or cutting off lambs&#x27; tails.

==Origins and history==
The earliest record of this rhyme is in a manuscript of around 1805, which contains only the first verse which references the adult Bo Peep , called &#x27;Little&#x27; because she was short and not because she was young. There are references to a children&#x27;s game called &quot;bo-peep&quot;, from the 16th century, including one in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; (Act I Scene iv), for which &quot;&quot; is thought to refer to the children&#x27;s game of peek-a-boo, but there&#x27;s no evidence that the rhyme existed earlier than the 18th century. The additional verses are first recorded in the earliest printed version in a version of &quot;Gammer Gurton&#x27;s Garland or The Nursery Parnassus&quot; in 1810, published in London by Joseph Johnson.

The phrase &quot;to play bo peep&quot; was in use from the 14th century to refer to the punishment of being stood in a pillory. For example, in 1364, an ale-wife, Alice Causton, was convicted of giving short measure, for which crime she had to &quot;play bo peep thorowe a pillery&quot;. Andrew Boorde uses the same phrase in 1542, &quot;&quot;. Nevertheless, connections with sheep are early; a fifteenth-century ballad includes the lines: &quot; // In every corner they play boe-peep&quot;.

<doc id="296392" wikidata="Q609388" url="?curid=296392" title="Sigurimi">
<text>The Directorate of State Security (, DSSh), commonly called the Sigurimi, was the state security, intelligence and secret police service of the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania. Its proclaimed goal was maintaining state security of Albania, but &quot;de facto&quot; the Sigurimi served to suppress political activity among the populace and preserve the existing political system. It is regarded as one of the most feared and repressive agencies to ever exist.

In 2008 the Albanian parliament discussed opening the so-called &quot;Sigurimi files&quot;, but the Socialist Party of Albania contested it. A government commission, created in 2015, has been assigned the task of publicizing the Sigurimi files and identifying candidates for public office who had collaborated with the communist regime; however, as of early 2017, the commission has not yet started its work, and critics have pointed out that most of the files were probably destroyed long ago.

==History==
While recent data places the Sigurimi&#x27;s official foundation on 10 December 1944 as the OZNA (&#x27;Department for Protection of the People&#x27;), historian Robert Elsie has argued that its organisational roots go as far back as 19 March 1943. Enver Hoxha credited the Sigurimi as instrumental in his faction&#x27;s ability to gain power over other Albanian partisan groups. The People&#x27;s Defense Division, formed in 1945 from Haxhi Lleshi&#x27;s most reliable resistance fighters, was the precursor to the Sigurimi&#x27;s 5,000-strong uniformed internal security force. 

In 1989 the division was organized into five regiments of mechanized infantry that could be ordered to quell any domestic disturbances posing a threat to the Party of Labour of Albania leadership. The Sigurimi had an estimated 30,000 officers, approximately 7,500 of them assigned to the People&#x27;s Army.

The organization ceased to exist in name in July 1991 and was replaced by the SHIK (&quot;National Informative Service&quot;). In early 1992, information on the organization, responsibilities, and functions of the SHIK was not available in Western publications. Some Western observers believed, however, that many of the officers and leaders of the SHIK had served in the Sigurimi and that the basic structures of the two organizations were similar.

==Activities==
The mission of the Sigurimi was to prevent counterrevolutions and to suppress opposition to the existing political system. Although groups of Albanian émigrés sought Western support for their efforts to overthrow the Communist government in the late 1940s and early 1950s, they quickly ceased to be a credible threat because of the effectiveness of the Sigurimi.

The activities of the Sigurimi were directed more toward political and ideological opposition than crimes against persons or property, unless the latter were sufficiently serious and widespread to threaten the regime. Its activities permeated Albanian society to the extent that every third citizen had either served time in labor camps or been interrogated by Sigurimi officers. Sigurimi personnel were generally career volunteers, recommended by loyal party members and subjected to careful political and psychological screening before they were selected to join the service. They had an elite status and enjoyed many privileges designed to maintain their reliability and dedication to the party.

==Organization==
The Sigurimi had a national headquarters and district headquarters in each of Albania&#x27;s twenty-six districts.

It was further organized into sections covering political control, censorship, public records, prison camps, internal security troops, physical security, counterespionage, and foreign intelligence.

The political control section&#x27;s primary function was monitoring the ideological correctness of party members and other citizens. It was responsible for purging the party, government, military, and its own apparatus of individuals closely associated with Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, or China after Albania broke from successive alliances with each of those countries. One estimate indicated that at least 170 communist party Politburo or Central Committee members were executed as a result of the Sigurimi&#x27;s investigations. The political control section was also involved in an extensive program of monitoring private telephone conversations.

The censorship section operated within the press, radio, newspapers, and other communications media as well as within cultural societies, schools, and other organizations.
The public records section administered government documents and statistics, primarily social and economic statistics that were handled as state secrets.

The prison camps section was charged with the political reeducation of inmates and the evaluation of the degree to which they posed a danger to society. Local police supplied guards for fourteen prison camps throughout the country.

The physical security section provided guards for important party and government officials and installations.

The counterespionage section was responsible for neutralizing foreign intelligence operations in Albania as well as domestic movements and parties opposed to the Albanian Party of Labour.

Finally, the foreign intelligence section maintained personnel abroad and at home to obtain intelligence about foreign capabilities and intentions that affected Albania&#x27;s national security. Its officers occupied cover positions in Albania&#x27;s foreign diplomatic missions, trade offices, and cultural centers.

<doc id="296393" wikidata="Q45935" url="?curid=296393" title="Perth Airport">
<text>Perth Airport is an international, domestic and general aviation airport serving Perth, Western Australia.

It is the fourth busiest airport in Australia measured by passenger movements and falls within the boundaries of the cities of Belmont, Kalamunda and Swan. Perth Airport and Jandakot Airport, the other civilian airport within the mainland Perth metropolitan region located about south-southwest of the general aviation area of the airport, recorded a combined total of 362,782 aircraft movements in 2017.

Perth Airport covers a total of 2,105 hectares (5,202 acres) of airport property.

Since 1997, it has been operated by Perth Airport Pty Ltd under a 99-year lease from the federal government.

==Location==

The airport is located approximately east of the Perth central business district. It is one of three civilian airports within the Perth metropolitan area, the others being Jandakot Airport and Rottnest Island Airport. Besides the civilian airports, there are also two military airports within the Perth metropolitan area. The larger of the two is RAAF Base Pearce, to the north of Perth Airport, at Bullsbrook. The other is south-west of Perth Airport, and is a part of the military base of HMAS Stirling on Garden Island.

Perth Airport is located on the Aboriginal traditional Whadjak-Noongar country.
==Growth and impact==
The airport saw strong passenger growth from 2000 to 2012, primarily due to the state&#x27;s prolonged mining boom and an increase in traffic from international low-cost carrier airlines. By the end of June 2012, Perth Airport experienced passenger growth of 11.7% internationally and 6.9% domestically, resulting in an overall increase of 10.3%. Passenger numbers trebled in the 10 years from 2002 to 2012 with more than 12.6 million people travelling through the airport in 2012. Since 2012, the winding down of the mining boom has seen the demand for both intra- and interstate services contract, with domestic passengers falling from a peak of 9.9 million (as of June 2013) to 9.5 million by the end of June 2016. The growth in passenger numbers since 2012 has been wholly due to expansion of international services from the city. The first mining boom in 1979 had 679,000 passengers use the airport. This number now travels through the airport every eighteen days.

As well as passenger movements however, complaints about the impact of the airport on the residents of Perth have grown. The City of Canning, one area that is affected, accepts that &quot;aircraft noise is an important issue&quot; and that &quot;[it] does impact heavily on those suburbs under the flightpaths&quot;. Another affected area, the City of Swan, &quot;has experienced significant issues&quot;. Indeed, planning policy adopted by the Government of Western Australia recognises that some aircraft noise is “not compatible with residential or educational” land use, two fundamental uses of land in any conurbation that is home to over two million residents—such as Greater Perth.

==History==
===Early days===
Prior to the opening of the Perth Airport, civilian air services for the city were provided from Maylands Aerodrome as well as on the city&#x27;s foreshore at Langley Park. By the end of the 1930s, it became clear that the Maylands Aerodrome was limited in the size and speed of aircraft it was able to handle thus causing them to seek an alternative site for a future airport.

Site selection and preparation of the original plans was undertaken by NM Fricker of the Department of Civil Aviation. In 1938, land was selected and purchased for the new aerodrome. The site selected in what was at the time Guildford, was an area of land granted by Governor James Stirling to local man John Scott, which later became the long disused Dunreath Golf Course.

A plaque located on a roadside wall of the old International terminal remains in permanent memory of Scott:

===Military operations===
Even before civil aviation operations could commence at the new site, the onset of World War II saw the facility being redesigned for military purposes as a temporary base for the Royal Australian Air Force and United States Navy, known as &quot;RAAF Station Guildford&quot;, primarily to supplement RAAF Base Pearce. Royal Australian Air Force No. 85 Squadron was based there from February 1943.

Despite military use of the airfield, civil services operated by Qantas Empire Airways and Australian National Airways (ANA) commenced from the location in 1944. This was despite bitter protest from military authorities who felt civilian operations would undermine the defence and camouflage needs of the location.

The move was agreed to by the government, as the larger types of aircraft of the day being operated by the two airlines could simply not be handled at Maylands, notwithstanding the small grass airfield, lack of passenger facilities, and approaches being difficult due to surrounding industrial infrastructure. Using Douglas DC-3 aircraft, ANA flew the first commercial service from the aerodrome to Adelaide. On 17 June 1944, Qantas made its inaugural flight to Ceylon via Exmouth using a modified Consolidated B-24 Liberator, arriving in Perth on 3 June 1944 having been released to the airline by the British Government.

===Early civilian operations===
Full civilian operations at the Guildford Aerodrome commenced in 1944. Civil operations at Maylands continued albeit reduced until 30 June 1963, when the airport closed and its function as a secondary airport was taken over by Jandakot Airport the very next day.

Guildford Aerodrome was at best only a basic airfield. On a large open airfield with plenty of space, an unobtrusive control tower was hidden away amongst a collection of buildings inherited from the wartime operations at the site. The Department of Civil Aviation inherited a large number of operating vehicles from the former military occupants, including an assortment of vehicles including (Ford or Chevrolet) Blitz wagons, Dodge command cars and weapon carriers, large trucks and various makes of fire tenders, jeeps and ambulances. Boarding aircraft at Guildford was described as being a bit like boarding a bus given the lack of passenger facilities at the time.

In 1948, the Horrie Miller owned MacRobertson Miller Airlines relocated from Maylands to Guildford. followed by newly formed government airline Trans Australia Airlines (TAA) on 2 December of that same year, operating Douglas C-54 Skymasters on its Perth – Melbourne – Sydney route. Due to the lack of road transportation across the Nullarbor Plain, it was at this time that Guildford became the scene of very busy cargo operations. Fresh fruit, vegetables and manufactured goods were being flown from east to west and back again.

The airport was granted international status in September 1952, and renamed from Guildford Aerodrome to Perth Airport in March 1953. Officiated by the Federal Minister for Civil Aviation, Hubert Anthony, the official ceremony for the renaming took place on the main apron in front of a converted Bellman hangar used by TAA as its passenger terminal. At the time, a new international terminal building was under construction but had not been completed in time for the ceremony. This new terminal was being constructed using steel and cladding recycled from American-built military quonset buildings being dismantled and shipped over from Manus Island.

It was also on this day that Qantas commenced its Wallaby service using Lockheed Constellations from Sydney to South Africa via Perth, the Cocos Islands and Mauritius.

===The jet age===

Towards the mid-1950s, airline travel was still being used by only a small percentage of the population. At that time, only 8% of the population had ever flown, but as the marketplace evolved, so did the types of people and their reasons for flying.

It was at this time the airport began to experience the full effects of the jet age. Both Air India and Qantas commenced operating Boeing 707s in the mid to late 1950s from Perth to Singapore and the sub continent. As the aircraft of the day grew faster more demanding due to their sophistication, facilities at the airport continued to improve to accommodate them. By the mid-1960s the airport was serving its first domestic pure jet engine aircraft, commencing with a Boeing 727 in 1964, and the Douglas DC-9 in 1967, both types operated by TAA and Ansett ANA. It was at this time that the airport was one of the few major airports in the country which operated without curfews, and due to the increased number and frequency of flights operating from the airport it gave birth to what was then referred to as &quot;the midnight horror&quot; or &quot;red-eye special&quot;, known in more recent history as the red-eye flight.

===Demise of the hangar terminals===
In 1960, the then international terminal previously constructed from steel and cladding from Manus Island was dismantled and re-erected in the suburb of Cannington. Known as The Alco Building, it was re-designed for use as a commercial facility.

The removal of the steel structure made way for the construction of an entirely new combined domestic and international passenger terminal, constructed on the northern side of the airfield. It was in 1962 that airlines were able to move from their hangars into a new combined passenger terminal, designed by the Commonwealth Department of Works and opened just in time to handle 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games traffic increases. The new combined terminal was opened that same year by then Minister for Civil Aviation, Senator Shane Paltridge; it was built in an area positioned between the present Terminals 3 and 4 and is currently used as the crew base for both Qantas and Jetstar, and offices for airlines and support firms.

===International terminal development===
From 1962 onwards, both the domestic and international passenger operations at the airport were provided by a single terminal. When it opened, the terminal&#x27;s facilities included an observation deck, a pond with black swans, and a cocktail lounge named the Orbit Inne, which became popular with locals as it was the only place in Perth that served drinks on Sunday nights. By the arrival of the Boeing 747 on 3 September 1971, the terminal had reached its capacity, and modelling of future passenger numbers showed it would be unable to handle any further increases in passenger demand.

In November 1980, the Federal Transport Minister, Ralph Hunt, announced that a new international terminal would be built in Perth at a cost of $26 million (1980). Design of the new International Terminal commenced in 1982, with one of the key principles of the design being the allowance for easy future expansion as the needs of the airport dictated. The project called for the construction of a new terminal, apron, airside roads, access roads, car parks and other passenger facilities.

Construction of the new International Terminal and control tower commenced in March 1984 on the south-eastern side of the airfield. In 1984, the road leading to the new terminal, Horrie Miller Drive was named in honour of local aviation pioneer Horrie Miller. The terminal was officially opened on 25 October 1986 by Prime Minister Bob Hawke, with the new terminal receiving passengers just days after. The newly built control tower was the tallest in Australia at the time of its construction, and remains the tallest in Australia.

Upon completion, the terminal was able to process up to five Boeing 747 aircraft per hour and accommodated a peak passenger volume of 6,000 passengers per hour. Twenty years later, in the 12 months to June 2006 the terminal processed over 2.027 million passengers, surpassing a 1996 projection of 1.016 million passengers in that period.

===1988 onwards===

In the late 1980s the Federal Government, as a prelude to eventual privatisation, formed the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC). In 1988, the FAC took over as manager of Perth Airport (and many other Australian airports).

At this time also, airline operators Australian Airlines (now Qantas domestic) and Ansett set about on ambitious capital works programs to construct new domestic terminals for their respective airlines on the northern side of the terminal, where they still stand to this day. In 2001, after the financial collapse of Ansett, the Ansett terminal became a multi-user terminal, catering for flights from former Ansett-subsidiary Skywest, as well as Virgin Australia and now charter airlines including Alliance Airlines and previously Air Australia. The Ansett terminal is known now as Terminal 1 Domestic, and the old International terminal is known as Terminal 1 International. The Air Australia and Qantas terminal is now Terminal 3-4, operating flights by Qantas and Jetstar.

In July 1997 Perth Airport Pty Ltd took up a 99-year lease as part of the Federal Government&#x27;s push to privatise airports. As at February 2024, Future Fund (30%), Utilities Trust of Australia (23%) and AustralianSuper (17%) were the major shareholders.

From 2003 to 2004, the International terminal underwent major internal refurbishments to provide an increased array of passenger services, including increased space for duty-free stores and food and beverage concession stands. Further upgrades valued at $25 million (2006) were made to the terminal across 2005 and 2006 which added an additional of floor space, additional check-in counters, and an improved baggage handling and screening system.

The airport commemorated its 60th anniversary in 2004, with an event that opened the new &quot;Taxiway Sierra&quot;, a new taxiway supporting larger aircraft such as the Boeing 747, Airbus A340 and Airbus A380.

On 14 October 2008, the Airbus A380 made its first visit to the airport as a part of Qantas&#x27; A380 promotional tour around Australia. The second A380 to visit the airport was an Emirates aircraft which made an emergency landing on 15 August 2009, after a passenger on a Dubai to Sydney flight suffered a stroke.

In 2012, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) released a report rating the Perth Airport as the worst in Australia, as judged by airlines. The same report rated it below satisfactory for the second year in a row. However, due to more recent expansions and projects, the airport was awarded Capital City airport of the year by the Australian Airports Association at their national conference in 2016. In 2018, Perth Airport was named the best airport in Australia for overall service quality by the ACCC after the completion of a $1 billion redevelopment project over the span of 5 years.
Terminal 2 was officially opened on 28 February 2013, with the first flights operating out of the terminal from 2 March 2013. The single story terminal features at-grade access to the terminal building and dedicated pick-up and drop-off lanes at the front of the terminal, a centralised passenger security screening zone, three baggage reclaim belts as well 14 aircraft bays, accessible from enclosed walkways and serviced by 8 boarding counters, and 36 additional aircraft parking bays.

In April 2015 works commenced on a $42 million upgrade of the forecourt and the passenger pick-up/drop-off areas in front of Terminal 1 to improve access. The upgrade was completed in November 2016.

In May 2015, Emirates commenced the first Airbus A380 service to Perth from Dubai following the completion of a dual level boarding gate, an expanded check-in hall, a refurbished departure area and other expansions to Terminal 1 including a new Emirates business class lounge. In August 2017, Emirates replaced its last remaining Emirates Boeing 777-300ER service with an Airbus A380, taking the total Emirates daily services to two.
However, this service was replaced by a Boeing 777 in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. On 1 November 2022, the first regular A380 service resumed.

On 22 November 2015 the domestic pier of Terminal 1 was opened; the pier became the exclusive home to Virgin Australia. Virgin Australia&#x27;s partner, Etihad Airways began daily direct services from its hub in Abu Dhabi on 16 July 2014; the pier ensures quick and seamless transfers between the two airlines. The pier will also be connected to Terminal 2 via an elevated walkway allowing seamless transfer to Virgin&#x27;s regional services without having to be re-screened.

On 15 May 2016, the world&#x27;s largest commercial jet airliner, the Antonov An-225 &quot;Mriya&quot; landed at Perth Airport, making its first visit to Perth and Australia.

On 11 December 2016, Qantas announced that it would commence non-stop flights from Perth to London Heathrow with one of its newly acquired Boeing 787s. To achieve this the Qantas domestic terminals at T3/T4 were upgraded during 2017 to cater for international flights. Once completed the existing Qantas flights to Singapore and Auckland also migrated from T1 to T3/T4, with all Qantas’ international flights now departing from Terminal 3’s international section. Services to London started in March 2018. In June 2022 Qantas began direct flights from Perth to Rome to be operated on a seasonal basis, three times a week, this created Perth Airports second direct connection to Europe. These services were followed by a direct service to Paris Charles de Gaulle beginning in July 2024, the third connection to Europe.

In May 2018, Qatar Airways upgraded their Perth-Doha service from the Boeing 777 to the Airbus A380, making them the second airline to begin A380 services to Perth. Although this service was downgraded in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, Qatar Airways would ultimately resume A380 services to Perth in December 2022.

In May 2024, it was announced that terminals T3 and T4 will receive upgrades to create additional capacity for Qantas services before the airline ultimately moves to a new terminal in the Airport Central precinct in 2031. In addition, domestic Jetstar services moved to T2 from December 2024, before rejoining Qantas at the new terminal once it is completed. These upgrades are part of an estimated $5 billion investment in the airport which will fund construction of both the new terminal and a third runway as well as two multi-storey carparks and a hotel in the Airport Central precinct.

On 28 June 2024, Rex Airlines commenced operations to Adelaide using Embraer E190s from National Jet Express, and to Melbourne using their own Boeing 737 aircraft. This marked the first time Rex had flown across the country to Perth. These flights were later withdrawn after Rex entered voluntary administration in July 2024.

In October 2024, it was announced that the airport&#x27;s first hotel would be open by 2027. Construction of the third runway was also announced to start in early 2025 for a 2028 opening.

==Facilities and services==
Perth Airport has five terminals: four main terminals and one minor terminal.
* On the eastern side of the airport (and the location of the future consolidated terminal precinct) are:
** Terminal 1 (T1), originally known as the International Terminal, caters primarily for flights originating or departing outside Australia, with five jetways and a total of seven gates including a Multi Access Ramp System which allows dual boarding of aircraft including the Boeing 777 and Airbus A380. There are four airline lounges: the Emirates lounge; a Singapore Airlines Silver Kris lounge; the Air New Zealand Lounge and the unaffiliated Aspire Lounge. The Emirates lounge has a second level and offers direct boarding on their flagship Airbus A380 aircraft. In November 2015, a new domestic pier opened at the west end of T1 to service Virgin Australia domestic flights. The domestic pier has eight gates and contains a Virgin Australia lounge. It is connected to T2 by a walkway.
** Terminal 2 (T2) is located to the immediate south west of T1 and caters primarily for regional services. Virgin Australia Regional and Alliance commenced operations from T2 in 2013 whilst Rex Airlines commenced operations from T2 in 2016. In September 2024, domestic Jetstar services transferred operations from T3 and T4 to T2. The terminal contains an Alliance lounge.
* On the western side of the airport are the remaining terminals; terminals T3 and T4 adjoin each other, with Qantas having exclusive use of both terminals since the movement of Virgin Australia to T1. The Perth Airport Master Plan outlines these two terminals will ultimately be demolished and replaced by a single new terminal east of T1.
** Terminal 3 (T3) has five jetways and a total of nine gates. It is currently used by Qantas for its domestic and international flights; for this latter purpose the terminal has been outfitted with customs and immigration facilities, and contains an international arrivals concourse. T3 contains two Qantas lounges, with one dedicated to the airline&#x27;s international passengers.
** Terminal 4 (T4) has four jetways and a total of nine gates and is dedicated to the domestic operations of Qantas and QantasLink. The terminal also facilitates check in for Qantas&#x27; international services. It has two member lounges: The Qantas Club, which was expanded in March 2013 to cater for an additional 140 passengers; and the Qantas Domestic Business Lounge, which opened in 2014. 
** There is also a general aviation terminal to the north of T3 and T4 simply called General Aviation that is used primarily by some charter aircraft and for mining companies with fly-in fly-out services, with Jandakot airport also serving that function.

===Runways===
Flights are serviced by two runways – the main 03/21 runway, and 06/24, .

In 1965, Runway 03/21 was extended from to to accommodate Boeing 707s.

After a 10-month project, a reconstructed cross runway was opened on 21 October 2005. The upgrades involved significant strengthening works and enlargement of turning nodes to accommodate regular operations by wide bodied aircraft, including the Airbus A380.

===Meteorological services===
Meteorological services for Perth Airport commenced in May 1944, provided by the Guildford Meteorological Office situated at Ivy Street, Redcliffe.

In March 1988, surface observations were moved to the recently vacated old airport tower on the northern side of the airfield (near what is now Terminal 3). The Ivy Street location was retained for a time for radar services and the launching and tracking of weather balloons. In October 1997, all operations from the Ivy Street Office and Old Control Tower were transferred to a newly constructed office on the Northern Perimeter Road in Belmont, in the north-eastern corner of the airfield.

===Landing patterns and approach===
Perth Airport resides within the Melbourne FIR, which is managed by Melbourne Centre and operated by Airservices Australia.

===Observation areas===

There are two dedicated spotting areas at Perth Airport. Terminal T1 has an Observation Deck on level 3 to view departing and arriving aircraft. It has vending machines, toilets (downstairs) and flight information displays.

The second spotting area is to the west side opposing the threshold of Runway 03 located along Dunreath Drive. The public viewing area has a shelter in the shape of the body section of a Boeing 747, and displays of information about the history of aviation.

===Other services===
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has its Perth regional office on Level 2 of the Hkew Alpha Building on the property of Perth Domestic Airport.

Since May 2014, terminals T1 International, T2 Regional and T3 Domestic have a free Wi-Fi connection currently powered by iiNet. It is accessible throughout the entirety of the departure and arrival areas. Currently, T4 Qantas Domestic also has free Wi-Fi service provided by Qantas.

The Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia had a purpose-built driver training facility at Perth Airport, the only one of its kind in the state. It was located towards the east of the current T1 International Terminal on Grogan Road.
==Airlines and destinations==

Perth Airport is served by 30 scheduled airlines flying to over 50 destinations in Australia, Oceania, Asia, Africa and Europe.

On the international front, a total of 213 scheduled international flights arrive and depart from Perth Airport each week. The following carriers operate to the following destinations:

===Passenger===


Qantas operates dedicated &#x27;flightseeing&#x27; services over Antarctica from Perth. These flights, using a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, depart Perth from Terminals 3 and 4, and provide a guided aerial tour of Antarctica before returning to Australia. These flights are about thirteen hours in total.

===Cargo===
==Operations and statistics==
===Total===
Total passengers using the airport has increased on average by 2.5% annually since 1998 to 2022, with 78% of passenger traffic at the airport attributed to domestic travel in 2022.


===Domestic===
===International===

==Ground transport==
===Road===
Road access from the city to terminals T1 and T2 is via Tonkin Highway and Airport Drive, and to terminals T3 and T4 via Tonkin Highway, Dunreath Drive and Brearley Avenue, or via Great Eastern Highway and Fauntleroy Avenue.

Transperth operates route 292, a circular route connecting terminals T3 and T4 to Redcliffe railway station. Transperth also operates route 37 from terminals T1 and T2 to Curtin University bus station. A transfer bus is operated by Carbridge between the T1/T2 and T3/T4 terminal precincts. Horizons West operate services between the terminals and surrounding carparks.

A number of car rental companies have set up operations at the airport, and all terminals feature pick-up and drop-off areas dedicated to taxis and rideshare services.

===Rail===
Situated about from terminals T1 and T2, Airport Central station is on the Airport line that runs through to the Perth central business district. The station and line opened on 9 October 2022. It is connected to terminals 1 and 2 via an enclosed pedestrian bridge.

The closest station to terminals T3 and T4 is Redcliffe, also on the Airport line, at a distance of about . Passengers for Terminals 3 and 4 can catch bus route 292, a circular service from Terminals 3 and 4 to Redcliffe station.

==Accidents and incidents==
===During construction===
* On 13 April 1987, a Hiller 12E helicopter was being used for the installation of a rotating beacon atop the control tower, then under construction. The beacon was attached to the helicopter for lifting by a chain sling. After the beacon had been lifted into place, workers disconnected the chain sling from it. As the helicopter was departing, The hook on the sling became snagged on the tower guard rail ... causing it to pitch nose down and roll to the right. With the cable being tensioned by the pull of the helicopter the hook freed itself [and sprang] while crashing the strike side of the tower towards the helicopter. The cable flew up around the tail boom and became entangled in one of the main rotor blades. The other main rotor blade severed the tail boom which fell free of the helicopter striking the side of the tower on its way to the ground. The major section of the helicopter then fell to the ground at the base of the tower, caught fire and was burnt out.The accident resulted in the death of the helicopter pilot. The subsequent investigation conducted by the Australian Transport Safety Board, found that the pilot&#x27;s licence was not endorsed for sling loading operations and he was not sufficiently current on the aircraft type to undertake such a job.

===Accidents en route===
* On 2 July 1949 a Douglas DC-3, named &quot;Fitzroy&quot;, departed from Perth Airport for Carnarvon. Moments after takeoff it crashed about a mile north of the airport, killing all 18 people on board.
* On 26 June 1950 a Douglas DC-4 Skymaster, named &quot;Amana&quot;, departed from Perth Airport for Adelaide. It crashed 22 minutes later, near York, Western Australia, killing 28 of the 29 occupants. The sole survivor died in a Perth hospital six days later. This accident and the TAA Fokker Friendship disaster remain Australia&#x27;s worst civil aviation accidents.

===Emergency alternative airports===
There are three emergency alternative airports for Perth, used usually in the case of fog or bad weather affecting Perth. In 2013, the state government flagged the need for a new emergency alternative airport, with Exmouth&#x27;s Learmonth Airport and Adelaide Airport being inconvenient due to their significant distance from Perth. In 2017, plans for Cunderdin Airport to become a diversion airport for Perth were put in place. In 2018, it was proposed that Kalgoorlie-Boulder Airport would be a better alternative than Cunderdin. In 2019, Busselton Margaret River Airport had its bid to become a designated alternate international airport approved.

===Other incidents===

In April 2020, Perth Airport staff parked heavy vehicles and heavy equipment in front of some Virgin Australia aircraft to prevent them from moving due to alleged unpaid debts by the airline.

In May 2024, a refuelling malfunction at the airport resulted in at least 70 international and domestic flights to be cancelled, delayed or diverted to regional airports.

On 15 September 2024, Runway 03 suffered pavement failure after a Qantas Airbus A330 took off from it. No one was injured however the runway suffered severe damage and forced the diversion of a Boeing 747-8F due to insufficient runway length.

==Future development==
===Consolidation of terminals===
The 2004 Perth Airport Master Plan aimed for the domestic and international terminals to be consolidated into a single terminal on the south-eastern side of the airfield by 2024. The updated 2020 Perth Airport Master Plan included a major expansion and upgrade of Terminal 1 and the construction of a new terminal adjacent to house Qantas&#x27; operations as part of the consolidation plans, with an intended completion date set for 2025.

However, the consolidation process faced protracted delays due to Qantas initially preferring to continue operating out of Terminals 3 and 4, a stance that drew criticism from both Perth Airport and the Western Australian state government. Qantas&#x27; transfer to Terminal 1 had been initially set to be completed by late 2025, but was pushed back due to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting air travel. Qantas had also cited a desire to upgrade and build out their current Perth hub in order to launch new international services before committing to a move to new facilities “over the long term”.

In May 2024, it was confirmed that Qantas and Perth Airport had come to an agreement for Qantas and Jetstar to move to a new terminal in the Airport Central precinct by 2031.

===Third runway===
The construction of a new runway (03R/21L) is planned. The new runway will be long and wide, while running parallel to the existing main runway and located between Terminal 1 and Abernethy Road. Construction of the runway is due to start in early 2025, with an intended opening in 2028.

===Other===

Perth Airport have confirmed plans to construct a 250-room hotel and two multi-storey carparks next to Airport Central Station, in alignment with its terminal consolidation plans.

The first of the new six-level carparks began construction in mid-2024 with an intended completion date of 2026. The existing road network in front of T1 and T2 will also be reconfigured, and will see new dedicated pick-up and drop-off points for passengers.

In October 2024 the airport announced it has partnered with Accor to run the hotel under the Pullman brand. The Pullman Perth Airport hotel is scheduled to be opened in 2027.

<text>A balun (from &quot;balanced to unbalanced&quot;, originally, but now derived from &quot;balancing unit&quot;) is an electrical device that allows balanced and unbalanced lines to be interfaced without disturbing the impedance arrangement of either line. A balun can take many forms and may include devices that also transform impedances but need not do so. Sometimes, in the case of transformer baluns, they use magnetic coupling but need not do so. Common-mode chokes are also used as baluns and work by eliminating, rather than rejecting, common mode signals.

== Types of balun ==
=== Classical transformer type ===

In classical transformers, there are two electrically separate windings of wire coils around the transformer&#x27;s core. The advantage of transformer-type over other types of balun is that the electrically separate windings for input and output allow these baluns to connect circuits whose ground-level voltages are subject to ground loops or are otherwise electrically incompatible; for that reason they are often called isolation transformers.

This type is sometimes called a &#x27;voltage balun&#x27;. The primary winding receives the input signal, and the secondary winding puts out the converted signal. The core that they are wound on may either be empty (air core) or, equivalently, a magnetically neutral material like a porcelain support, or it may be a material which is good magnetic conductor like ferrite in modern high-frequency (HF) baluns, or soft iron as in the early days of telegraphy.

The electrical signal in the primary coil is converted into a magnetic field in the transformer&#x27;s core. When the electrical current through the primary reverses, it causes the established magnetic field to collapse. The collapsing magnetic field then induces an electric field in the secondary winding.

The ratio of loops in each winding and the efficiency of the coils&#x27; magnetic coupling determines the ratio of electrical potential (voltage) to electrical current and the total power of the output. For idealized transformers, although the ratio of voltage to current will change in exact proportion to the square of the winding ratio, the power (measured in watts) remains identical. In real transformers, some energy is lost inside to heating of the metallic core of the transformer, to the AC and DC resistances of the winding conductors, and lost outside to the surrounding environment because of imperfect magnetic coupling between the two coils.

=== Autotransformer type ===

An ideal balun consists of two wires (primary and secondary) and a core: the current in the primary wire generates a magnetic field in the core, which in turn induces an electric field in the secondary wire.
An autotransformer balun has only one coil, or is made of two or more coils that have an electrical connection, wound around a core. One can also make an autotransformer from an ordinary transformer by cross-wiring the primary and secondary windings. Baluns made with autotransformer windings are also called &quot;voltage baluns&quot;, since they produce balanced output voltage, but not necessarily balanced current.
In all autotransformers, the single winding must have at least one extra electrical connection – called a &quot;tap&quot; or &quot;tap point&quot; – between the two ends of the winding. The current sent into the balun through one pair of connections acts as if it were a primary coil, and magnetizes the entire core. When the electric current in the input segment of the coil changes, the induced magnetic field collapses and the collapse of the magnetic field in the core induces an electric current in the entire coil. Electrical connections to parts of the coil different from the input connections have higher or lower voltages depending on the length of the coil that the output is tapped from.

Unlike transformer-type baluns, an autotransformer balun provides a path for DC current to ground from every terminal. Since outdoor antennas are prone to build-up of static electric charge, the path for the static to drain to ground through an autotransformer balun can be a distinct advantage.

=== Transmission-line transformer type ===
Transmission line or &quot;choke&quot; baluns can be considered as simple forms of transmission line transformers. This type is sometimes called a &quot;current balun&quot;, since it ensures equal current on both sides of its output, but not necessarily equal voltage. These are normally called ununs, because they go from unbalanced to unbalanced or un-un. Baluns are balanced to unbalanced or bal-un.
A more subtle type results when the transformer type (magnetic coupling) is combined with the transmission line type (electro-magnetic coupling). Most typically the same kind of transmission line wires are used for the windings as carry the signal from the radio to the antenna, although these baluns can be made using any type of wire. The resulting devices have very wideband operation. &quot;Transmission line transformers&quot; commonly use small ferrite cores in toroidal rings or two-hole, binocular, shapes.

The Guanella transmission line transformer (Guanella 1944) is often combined with a balun to act as an impedance matching transformer. Putting balancing aside a transformer of this type consists of a 75 Ω transmission line divided in parallel into two 150 Ω cables, which are then combined in series for 300 Ω. It is implemented as a specific wiring around the ferrite core of the balun.

Classic magnetic transformers are limited in maximum frequency due to the permeability of the magnetic material, which declines rapidly above MHz frequencies. This limits the operating frequency to around 1 GHz. Microwave systems require baluns in the 1-100 GHz range for applications including mixers, push-pull amplifiers, and interface to differential analog to digital and digital to analog converters. 

Transmission line transformer baluns with a high frequency transmission line such as a wirewound pair are able to operate at significantly higher frequencies (to 8 GHz and above) by combining capacitive coupling with magnetic coupling typical of classic magnetic transformers.

=== Planar and Marchand Baluns ===
To operate at even higher frequencies, magnetic loading becomes ineffective. Nathan Marchand proposed a &#x27;conversion transformer&#x27; that was capable of operation over a 1:3 bandwidth ratio in 1944. This basic circuit has been widely adapted and modified for use in planar structures (such as MMICs and RFICs) at frequencies up to at least 100 GHz. 

These types of planar baluns work exciting a mode in a ground plane or shield, which is then &#x27;floated&#x27; away from the main ground. This allows extraction of the negative signal in addition to the main transmission line, creating positive and negative signal pairs. By connecting the positive and negative signal paths in various configurations dozens of balun configurations have been proposed and published in the electronics literature.

==Self-resonance==
Although baluns are designed as magnetic devices – each winding in a balun is an inductor – all transformers made of real materials also have a small capacitance between the primary and secondary windings, as well as between individual loops in any single winding, forming unwanted &quot;self-capacitance&quot;.

The electrical connection of capacitance and inductance leads to a frequency where the electrical reactance of the self-inductance and self-capacitance in the balun are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign: that is, to resonance. A balun of any design operates poorly at or above its self-resonant frequency, and some of the design considerations for baluns are for the purpose of making the resonant frequency as far above the operating frequency as possible.

== Balun alternatives ==
An RF choke can be used in place of a balun. If a coil is made using coaxial cable near to the feed point of a balanced antenna, then the RF current that flows on the outer surface of the coaxial cable can be attenuated. One way of doing this would be to pass the cable through a ferrite toroid. The end result is exactly the same as a 1:1 current balun (or Guanella-type balun). (Straw 2005, 2526)

== Applications ==
A balun&#x27;s function is generally to achieve compatibility between systems, and as such, finds extensive application in modern communications, particularly in realising frequency conversion mixers to make cellular phone and data transmission networks possible. They are also used to send an E1 carrier signal from coaxial cable (BNC connector, 1.0/2.3 connector, 1.6/5.6 connector, Type 43 connectors) to UTP CAT-5 cable or IDC connector.

=== Radio and television ===

In television, amateur radio, and other antenna installations and connections, baluns convert between impedances and symmetry of feedlines and antennas.

For example, transformation of 300-Ω twin-lead or 450-Ω ladder line (balanced) to 75-Ω coaxial cable (unbalanced), or to directly connect a balanced antenna to unbalanced coaxial cable. To avoid feed line radiation, baluns are typically used as a form of common mode choke attached at the antenna feed point to prevent the coaxial cable from acting as an antenna and radiating power. This typically is needed when a balanced antenna (for instance, a dipole) is fed with coax; without a balun, the shield of the coax could couple with one side of the dipole, inducing common mode current, and becoming part of the antenna and unintentionally radiating.

In measuring the impedance or radiation pattern of a balanced antenna using a coaxial cable, it is important to place a balun between the cable and the antenna feed. Unbalanced currents that may otherwise flow on the cable will make the measured antenna impedance sensitive to the configuration of the feed cable, and the radiation pattern of small antennas may be distorted by radiation from the cable.

Baluns are present in radars, transmitters, satellites, in every telephone network, and probably in most wireless network modem/routers used in homes. It can be combined with transimpedance amplifiers to compose high-voltage amplifiers out of low-voltage components.

===Video===
Baseband video uses frequencies up to several megahertz. A balun can be used to couple video signals to twisted-pair cables instead of using coaxial cable. Many security cameras now have both a balanced unshielded twisted pair (UTP) output and an unbalanced coaxial one via an internal balun. A balun is also used on the video recorder end to convert back from the 100 Ω balanced to 75 Ω unbalanced. A balun of this type has a BNC connector with two screw terminals.
VGA/DVI baluns are baluns with electronic circuitry used to connect VGA/DVI sources (laptop, DVD, etc.) to VGA/DVI display devices over long runs of CAT-5/CAT-6 cable. Runs over 130 m (400 ft) may lose quality because of attenuation and variations in the arrival time of each signal. A skew control and special low skew or skew free cable is used for runs over 130 m (400 ft).

=== Audio ===

In audio applications, baluns serve multiple purposes: they can convert between high-impedance unbalanced and low impedance balanced lines. Another application is decoupling of devices (avoidance of earth loops).

A third application of baluns in audio systems is in the provision of balanced mains power to the equipment. The common-mode rejection of interference characteristic of balanced mains power, eliminates a wide range of noise coming from the wall plug, e.g. mains-borne interference from air conditioner/furnace/refrigerator motors, switching noise produced by fluorescent lighting and dimmer switches, digital noise from personal computers, and radio frequency signals picked up by the power lines/cords acting as antennae. This noise infiltrates the audio/video system through the power supplies and raises the noise floor of the entire system.

Except for the connections, the three devices in the image are electrically identical, but only the leftmost two can be used as baluns. The device on the left would normally be used to connect a high impedance source, such as a guitar, into a balanced microphone input, serving as a passive DI unit. The one in the center is for connecting a low impedance balanced source, such as a microphone, into a guitar amplifier. The one at the right is not a balun, as it provides only impedance matching.

===Other applications===

<text>Master of Orion (abbreviated as MoO) is a turn-based, 4X science fiction strategy game in which the player leads one of ten races to dominate the galaxy through a combination of diplomacy and conquest while developing technology, exploring and colonizing star systems.

Sometimes described as a scifi-themed spin-off of classic &quot;Civilization&quot;, the game has proven to be quite enduring, becoming a cult classic in its niche of sci-fi-themed 4X strategy games. It has received several direct sequels, and additionally, a number of other games published since have been described as inspired by it, with reviewers and players divided on whether any has succeeded at recapturing the feeling and gameplay of the original.

The game was released in 1993 by MicroProse on the MS-DOS operating system. It was ported to Mac OS in 1995 by Take-Two Interactive and distributed by GameTek. It is the first in its franchise, and the rights are held by Wargaming.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Master of Orion&quot; is a turn-based game. In the first iteration of the franchise, one can only play against the artificial intelligence (AI). Human and AI players control the management of colonies, technology development, ship construction, inter-species diplomacy, and combat.

The software generates a map randomly at the start of each game; the player can only choose the size of the galaxy, and the number and difficulty of AI opponents. In the first game, star systems have at most one colonizable planet and a few have none. Later games have more planets.

&quot;Master of Orion&quot; has 10 playable races, each with a specialty. For instance, the Humans have advantages in trade and diplomacy; the Bulrathi are the best at ground combat; the Silicoids ignore pollution and can colonize even the most hostile planets, but have slow population growth. Each race is predisposed to like or dislike some of the other races, and is advantaged or disadvantaged in different research fields. The other 7 races are; Alkari, Darloks, Klackons, Meklar, Mrrshan, Sakkra, and Psilon.

The game begins with a single homeworld, one colony ship, and two scout ships that can be used to explore nearby stars. The game will sometimes produce random events which can be harmful or advantageous. One planet is Orion, &quot;throne-world of the Ancients&quot; and most valuable research site in the galaxy, protected by a powerful warship, the Guardian. Victory is gained either by eliminating all opponents or by winning a vote on peaceful unification.

There are seven normal and six hostile planet types. The various hostile types require increasingly advanced technology to colonize. Size determines the planet&#x27;s initial population capacity. Mineral wealth dramatically influences a colony&#x27;s industrial productivity while Habitability influences population growth rates. Hostile planets are the most likely to be rich or ultra-rich in minerals. Artifact worlds contain relics of a now-vanished advanced civilization. All planets can be upgraded to Gaia class with the appropriate technologies. Planets can be upgraded in three ways:
* Terraforming increases population capacity by a fixed amount for each tech level achieved, up to a maximum of 120 extra units.
* Soil enrichment increases a planet&#x27;s population capacity and growth rate but can not be used on hostile planets. The advanced version increases capacity by up to 50% of its initial value and doubles the rate of population growth. Growth is increased by assigning the planet the modifier &quot;Fertile&quot;, and then eventually &quot;Gaia&quot;.
* Atmospheric terraforming converts hostile planets to normal ones, making soil enrichment possible there.
Planet type does not affect the costs and benefits of terraforming and soil enrichment.
Sliders are used to allocate a colony&#x27;s output between ship construction, planetary defenses, factory construction, ecology, and research. Planetary population generates production, especially when assisted by factories. There is a limit on the number of factories a unit of population can operate, but building upgrades can increase this. Defense spending is used to build additional missile bases, upgrade missile bases or planetary shields. Military and spy maintenance is deducted from every colony&#x27;s production. A planet&#x27;s output can also be transferred to the treasury at a loss.

Ships can travel to any star system within their range and combat always occurs in orbit over a planet - it is impossible to intercept enemy ships in deep space. Players can control space combat manually or ask the software to resolve combat automatically.

===Technology===

The designers regard technology as the most important contribution to a player&#x27;s success. Funding can be put into one or all of the game&#x27;s six independent tech tree fields, including Computers, Construction, Force Fields, Planetary Science, Vehicle Propulsion, and Weapons.

If a ship uses a component from a particular technology area, further advances in that area reduce the cost and size of the component; this effect is called &quot;miniaturization&quot;. When one has researched all of the technologies in an area of the tech tree, further research can discover &quot;advanced technologies&quot; in that area, which do not provide specific new capabilities but increase the miniaturization of ship components.

Battles are almost always decided by numbers and technology rather than by clever tactics. Players can design and use their own ships. There are four hull sizes; smaller sizes are harder to hit while larger ships can survive more damage and hold more components. There are eight types of components, each with different effects. Only six ship designs can be used at a time.

=== Weapons ===
Weapons are used in combat, and can be mounted to ships or given to ground units. When on ships, weapons are often unique and have their own effects, with their own cost and space taken up. Weapons for ground troops make ground defense and attacks more effective.

==== Special weapons ====
Special weapons are a branch-off of weapons, which do not take up standard weapon slots, rather special slots. these cannot be stacked, unlike standard weapons. They have much more unique effects, and some just make other weapons better, rather than dealing damage themselves.

==== Biological weapons ====
Biological weapons are designed exclusively for use in attacking planets. They destroy enemy population points and reduce the target&#x27;s habitability (i.e., its maximum population size), leaving any missile bases and factories there intact. Use of these weapons causes political fallout and every other player in the game shifts a level toward despising you. Note that Bio Toxin Antidote and Universal Antidote prevent the loss of 1 and 2 million in population per biological attack, respectively. Unfortunately, neither of these will reduce the damage done by biological attacks to a planet&#x27;s habitability.

==== Bombs ====
Bombs are weapons which are designed to attack planets rather than enemy ships. They deal more damage than any other weapon type to colonies, but cannot target ships, and always have the minimum possible range.

===Diplomacy===
&quot;Master of Orion&quot; provides a wide range of diplomatic negotiations: gifts of money or technology; one-time technology trades; trade pacts that boost industrial output; non-aggression and alliance treaties. Players can also threaten each other, declare war and arrange cease-fires. Each AI player remembers others&#x27; actions, both positive and negative, and will be unwilling to form alliances with a player who has broken previous treaties with it.

Under AI control, each race has a ruler personality and an objective, such as Xenophobic Expansionist or Pacifistic Technologist. These traits guide their politics and economic management; for example militarists maintain large fleets and prioritize technologies which have military benefits, while ecologists put a lot of effort into pollution control and terraforming. Traits vary from game to game. Each race has most probable traits and avoids their opposites. Races may occasionally revolt and change traits, but players can force a revolt, and turn the population against the leader using spies.

Hostile actions do not automatically cause war. Clashes are even expected at the opening of the game, when all sides are sending probes out into the unknown. On the other extreme, a ground assault must be knowingly targeted at an inhabited planet, and is a massive provocation.

Colonies can be bombed from space, or taken in ground invasions. Ground invasions can be conducted through enemy defenses. Present enemy ships or missile bases will fire on the approaching transports, possibly destroying some or all of them. The invasion itself is fully automatic. Results depend on numbers, technology and (if one of the races involved is Bulrathi) racial ground combat bonus.

Invasion is expensive. In the first game, there are no special soldier units; colonial population itself is sent to fight, exterminate the existing inhabitants, and form a new planetary population. The production capacity of any remaining factories can be gleaned, and plundering of technologies if enough factories survived the attack. Controlling a new system extends the range of the invader&#x27;s ships.

==Development==
&quot;Master of Orion&quot; is a significantly expanded and refined version of the prototype/predecessor game &quot;Star Lords&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;Starlord&quot;, also released by MicroProse in 1993). Steve Barcia&#x27;s game development company Simtex demonstrated &quot;Star Lords&quot; to MicroProse and gaming journalist Alan Emrich who, along with Tom Hughes, assisted Barcia in refining the design to produce &quot;Master of Orion&quot;; and the game&#x27;s manual thanks them for their contributions. Emrich and Hughes later wrote the strategy guide for the finished product. MicroProse published the final version of the game in 1994.

&quot;Star Lords&quot;, often called &quot;Master of Orion 0&quot; by fans, was a prototype and never commercially released (its intro opens with &quot;SimTex Software and Your Company present&quot;). The crude but fully playable prototype was made available as freeware in 2001, stripped of all documentation and copy protection, in anticipation of the launch of &quot;Master of Orion III&quot;. Major differences between &quot;Star Lords&quot; and &quot;Master of Orion&quot; include inferior graphics and interface, simpler trade and diplomacy, undirected research, a lack of safeguards to prevent players from building more factories than are usable and the use of transports rather than colony ships to colonize new planets. One feature of &quot;Star Lords&quot; that &quot;Master of Orion&quot; lacks is a table of relations between the computer-controlled races. The game was eventually made available for download on FilePlanet and the home page for &quot;Master of Orion III&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Master of Orion&quot; sold over 100,000 copies. It also received strong reviews. Emrich in a September 1993 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; preview described &quot;Master of Orion&quot; as &quot;the best that galactic conquest can offer&quot;, and summarized its type of gameplay as &quot;4X&quot;, meaning &quot;e&quot;X&quot;plore, e&quot;X&quot;pand, e&quot;X&quot;ploit, e&quot;X&quot;terminate&quot;. He and later commentators noted earlier examples of this genre, including &quot;Civilization&quot; (1991) and &quot;Reach for the Stars&quot; (1983). The magazine&#x27;s full December 1993 review stated that &quot;&quot;Master of Orion&quot; is one of those games where one must actually put effort into finding something inadequate about the game design, and that in itself is probably the highest praise this reviewer can give a product&quot;. The magazine concluded that it was &quot;a definite Game of the Year candidate as well as Exhibit A in many divorce cases&quot;. A February 1994 survey of space war games gave &quot;Master of Orion&quot; a grade of A−, stating that &quot;it&#x27;s still conquest, but it&#x27;s conquest that begins to have an interesting point to it&quot;. The reviewer wished that the game supported multiple players, but predicted that &quot;I think &quot;MOO&quot; will safely reign supreme well into the new year&quot;. A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game four-plus stars out of five, saying that it was &quot;a richly-textured product. Graphics coupled with high play yield a high recommendation&quot;.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Macintosh version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, calling the game as &quot;strategy game of the year, NOT&quot;.

&quot;Master of Orion&quot; was named the best strategy game of 1993 by &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot;. It also won &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Strategy Game of the Year award in June 1994. The editors called it &quot;a game that is worthy of being called ″&quot;Civilization&quot; in Space&#x27;&quot;, and wrote that it &quot;epitomizes and expands the &#x27;Conquer the Galaxy&#x27; motif in strategy gaming&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; ranked &quot;Master of Orion&quot; as the 33rd best game of all time. In 1998, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; declared it the 45th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it &quot;a great sci-fi space epic&quot;. In 2003, IGN ranked it as the 98th top game. &quot;Master of Orion&quot; is a member of both GameSpy&#x27;s Hall of Fame (2001) and GameSpot&#x27;s list of the greatest games of all time. The Gamer included it in their list of top 10 games in the 4X genre.

In retrospective reviews, Allgame, GameSpot and IGN regarded &quot;MoO&quot; as the standard by which turn based strategy games set in space are judged.

=== Sequels ===
Three commercial sequels to &quot;Master of Orion&quot; have been released, &quot;Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares&quot;, &quot;Master of Orion III&quot; and &quot;Master of Orion: Conquer the Stars&quot;. The sequels are significantly more advanced in graphics and sound and feature large differences in gameplay, with some players claiming the original game remains the best version of the series.

In 1997, MicroProse released a &quot;Master of Orion&quot; &quot;Jr.&quot; scenario as part of the &quot;Civ II: Fantastic Worlds&quot; expansion for &quot;Civilization II&quot;. In 2001, &quot;Star Lords&quot;, developed as &quot;Master of Orion&quot; prototype, was released as freeware as part of the promotion for &quot;Master of Orion III&quot;. Also a potential future release of the MOO and MOO2 source code was indicated by the MOO3 developers in 2001. In 2011, a clone of &quot;MoO II&quot;, titled &quot;Starbase Orion&quot;, was published by Chimera Software, LLC for the iPhone. The game setting has been the influence of Russian writer Sergey Lukyanenko&#x27;s trilogy, the &quot;Line of Delirium&quot;.

In July 2013, Wargaming bought the &quot;Master of Orion&quot; franchise from the Atari bankruptcy proceedings. A &quot;reimagining&quot; subtitled &quot;Conquer the Stars&quot; was released on August 25, 2016.

=== Influence ===
&quot;Master of Orion&quot; became an influence on future space strategy games. It was the first game to be described as a 4X game, and helped establish the conventions for the genre going forward. The team behind &quot;Stellaris&quot; based their game partially on the &quot;Master of Orion&quot; series, but also said it was important to &quot;try new things and leave the old formulas from the 90s behind&quot;. Writer George R. R. Martin mentioned it among the games he used to play most often.

<doc id="296406" wikidata="Q3516365" url="?curid=296406" title="Goods and services tax (Canada)">
<text>The goods and services tax (GST; ) is a value added tax introduced in Canada on January 1, 1991, by the government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. The GST, which is administered by Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), replaced a previous hidden 13.5% manufacturers&#x27; sales tax (MST). 

Introduced at an original rate of 7%, the GST rate has been lowered twice and currently sits at rate of 5%, since January 1, 2008. The GST raised 11.7% of total federal government revenue in 2017–2018. 

In five provinces, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario and Prince Edward Island, the GST is combined with provincial sales tax (PST) into a harmonized sales tax (HST). In Quebec both GST and QST are collected and administered together by the provincial government. British Columbia had an HST from 2010 until 2013, when it was removed after a provincial referendum. Alberta and the territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut have the GST but no provincial or territorial sales taxes.

==Definition==
The goods and services tax is defined in law at Part IX of the &quot;Excise Tax Act&quot;. GST is levied on supplies of goods or services purchased in Canada and includes most products, except certain politically sensitive essentials such as groceries, residential rent, medical services, and services such as financial services. Businesses that purchase goods and services that are consumed, used or supplied in the course of their &quot;commercial activities&quot; can claim &quot;input tax credits&quot; subject to prescribed documentation requirements (i.e., when they remit to the Canada Revenue Agency the GST they have collected in any given period of time, they are allowed to deduct the amount of GST they paid during that period). This avoids &quot;cascading&quot; (i.e., the application of the GST on the same good or service several times as it passes from business to business on its way to the final consumer). In this way, the tax is essentially borne by the final consumer. This system is not completely effective, as shown by criminals who defrauded the system by claiming GST input credits for non-existent sales by a fictional company. Exported goods are &quot;zero-rated&quot;, while individuals with low incomes can receive a GST rebate calculated in conjunction with their income tax.

==Untaxed items==
The tax is a 5% tax imposed on the supply of goods and services that are purchased in Canada, except certain items that are either &quot;exempt&quot; or &quot;zero-rated&quot;:

* For tax-free — i.e., &quot;zero-rated&quot; — sales, GST is charged by suppliers at a rate of 0% so effectively there is no GST collected. However, when a supplier makes a zero-rated supply, it is eligible to recover any GST paid on purchases used in producing the particular supply or service. This effectively removes the cascading tax from these particular goods and services.
**Common zero-rated items include basic groceries, prescription drugs, inward/outbound transportation and medical devices (GST/HST Memoranda Series ME-04-02-9801-E 4.2 Medical and Assistive Devices). Certain exports of goods and services are also zero-rated. Print books and print scholarly journals are untaxed; however, ebooks and online periodicals are taxed as well as any periodicals with a significant amount of advertising.
* For tax-exempt supplies, the supply is not subject to GST and suppliers do not charge tax on their exempt supplies. Furthermore, suppliers that make exempt supplies are not entitled to recover GST paid on inputs acquired for the purposes of making the exempt good or service (subject to certain public sector body rebates). Tax-exempt items include long term residential rents, health and dental care, educational services, day-care services, music lessons, legal aid services, and financial services.

==Background==

In 1989, the Progressive Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his finance minister Michael Wilson proposed the creation of a national sales tax of 9%. At that time, every province in Canada except Alberta already had its own provincial sales tax imposed at the retail level.

The purpose of the national sales tax was to replace the 13.5% Manufacturers&#x27; Sales Tax (MST) that the federal government imposed at the wholesale level on manufactured goods. Mulroney claimed the GST was implemented because the MST was hindering the manufacturing sector&#x27;s ability to export competitively. Manufacturers were concerned that the tax hurt their international competitiveness. The GST also replaced the Federal Telecommunications Tax of 11%. 

The introduction of the GST was very controversial. Although the GST was promoted as revenue-neutral in relation to the MST, a large proportion of the Canadian population disapproved of the tax. The other parties in Parliament also attacked the idea as did three Progressive Conservative Members of Parliament, David Kilgour, Pat Nowlan, and Alex Kindy, who ended up leaving the Progressive Conservative caucus as a result.

The Liberal-dominated Senate refused to pass the tax into law. In an unprecedented move to break the deadlock, Mulroney used a little-known constitutional provision (Section 26 of the Constitution Act, 1867) to increase the number of senators by eight temporarily, thus giving the Progressive Conservatives a majority in the upper chamber. In response, the Opposition launched a filibuster and further delayed the legislation.

Despite the tax being lowered to 7% by the time it became enacted, it remained controversial. What the tax covered also caused anger. The Government defended the tax as a replacement for a tax unseen by consumers because it was placed on manufacturers, and in the long run it was posited that removing the MST would make Canada more competitive. Once the MST was replaced with the GST prices did not initially fall by the level some thought appropriate immediately; however, proponents have argued that in Canada&#x27;s market economy the MST&#x27;s replacement could only be expected to influence prices over time and not on a stroke.

Despite the opposition, the tax came into force on January 1, 1991.

==Reactions==

A strong Liberal Party majority was elected under the leadership of Jean Chrétien in the 1993 election. The Progressive Conservative Party fared very poorly in that election, winning only two seats. Although the party recovered somewhat in subsequent elections, it remained the smallest party in the House of Commons until it disbanded itself permanently in 2003, and merged with the Canadian Alliance to form the Conservative Party of Canada.

During the election campaign, Chrétien promised to repeal the GST, which the Liberals had denounced while they were the Official Opposition, and replace it with a different tax. Instead of repeal, the Chrétien government attempted to restructure the tax and merge it with the provincial sales taxes in each province. They intended to call it the &quot;Blended Sales Tax&quot;, but opponents quickly came to derisively call this proposal the &quot;B.S. Tax&quot;, and the name was changed to Harmonized Sales Tax before its introduction. However, only three Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador) agreed to go along with this plan, joined by British Columbia and Ontario in 2010, and Prince Edward Island in 2013. British Columbia later repealed the tax.

The decision not to abolish or replace the GST caused great controversy. Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) John Nunziata voted against the Liberal government&#x27;s first budget and was expelled from the party. Heritage Minister Sheila Copps, who had personally promised to oppose the tax, resigned and sought re-election. She was re-elected with ease in the subsequent by-election, as was the Liberal government in the 1997 election.

==Provincial Variance==
In 1997, the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland (now Newfoundland and Labrador) and the Government of Canada merged their respective sales taxes into the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). In all Atlantic provinces, the current HST rate is 15%. HST is administered by the Canada Revenue Agency, with revenues divided among participating governments according to a formula. Ontario and British Columbia both harmonized the GST with their provincial sales tax (PST) effective July 1, 2010. However, the British Columbia HST was defeated in an August 2011 mail-in referendum by a 55% majority vote, and was converted to the old GST/PST system effective April 1, 2013. On the same day, Prince Edward Island enacted HST at the rate of 14%. In Ontario, the HST totals 13%; however, many of the pre-HST exemptions remain affecting only the provincial portion of the HST (for example, prepared food under $4.00 is not subject to the provincial portion of HST and is only taxed at 5%). On the other hand, some items that were only subjected to the PST are now charged the full HST (i.e., 13%). Although the Government of Ontario has made efforts to provide documentation as to what items are affected and how, this causes some confusion for consumers as they are often not sure what taxes to expect at the checkout. To accommodate these exemptions, many retailers simply display each tax individually as HST 1 and HST 2 (or some variant). The move to HST came about as part of Ontario&#x27;s 2009 provincial budget. Only three provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan) continue to impose a separate sales tax at the retail level only. Alberta is the exception, not imposing a provincial sales tax.

==Current situation==

During the campaign for the 2006 Canadian federal election, the Conservative Party, led by Stephen Harper, pledged to reduce the GST immediately by 1 percentage point and thereafter by another percentage point in the next five years. That pledge was criticized by then Finance Minister Ralph Goodale as favouring the &quot;biggest spenders&quot; who would receive the biggest savings. Stephen Harper&#x27;s Conservatives won that election and formed a minority government on February 6, 2006. On July 1, 2006, the Government of Canada reduced the tax by 1 percentage point (to 6%). They again lowered it to 5%, effective January 1, 2008. This reduction was included in the Final 2007 Budget Implementation Bill (Bill C-28), which received Royal Assent on December 14, 2007. This change has been estimated to have decreased government revenues by approximately $6 billion. Opponents of these tax decreases cited that sales taxes target those who spend more and therefore such reductions disproportionately benefit Canadians giving those who have the most and spend the most the largest tax decrease.

Much of the reason for the notoriety of the GST in Canada is for reasons of the Division of Powers in the Constitution. Other countries with a Value Added Tax legislate that posted prices include the tax; thus, consumers are vaguely aware of it, but &quot;what they see is what they pay&quot;. Canada cannot do this because jurisdiction over most advertising and price-posting is in the domain of the provinces under the Constitution Act, 1867. The provinces have chosen not to require prices to include the GST, similar to their provincial sales taxes. As a result, virtually all prices (except for fuel pump prices, taxi meters and a few other things) are shown &quot;pre-GST&quot;, with the tax (or taxes) listed separately.

<text>The State Intelligence Service (), commonly known by its acronym SHISH, is the main intelligence agency of Albania. It was preceded by SHIK.

==After the Declaration of Independence==
The government decree of Ismail Qemali explicitly stated the need to establish a secret service for the occupied areas of Albania in Article 6. These historical records are kept in Fund No. 145 of the Central State Archive, specifically within the files of the Provisional Presidency of Vlora in the year 1912, under the title &quot;Decisions and Minutes of the Provisional Government of Vlora on Political, Military, and Financial Issues&quot; (File II-2). The creation of the Albanian Secret Service was not merely a theoretical concept, as concrete actions were taken to set it up, including the involvement of individuals such as Lef Nosi and Bajram Curri. Furthermore, there is evidence of the Service&#x27;s continued operation even after Prince Wilhelm Wied assumed rulership of Albania, which was established through the London Peace Conference in 1913.

== During the reign of Prince Wied ==
The Albanian secret service was continued after the First World War and the departure of Prince Wied from Albania. The Statute of Lushnja, which was drafted at the Lushnja National Congress on January 21, 1920, re-established the separation of powers into legislature, executive, and judiciary, and it also created the Ministry of the Interior, which included the Secret Service. Ahmet Zogu was appointed as the Minister of Internal Affairs.

== After World War II ==
After the Second World War, the Albanian state gave considerable importance to the establishment of State Security Organs, which took place from December 1944 to March 1945.

== Communist period ==
The origins of the State Security can be traced back to July 20, 1943, when the General National Liberation Council decided to create this organization. The State Security consisted of individuals deemed highly trustworthy by the communist regime, and it functioned as a branch within the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

== Post-communist period==
After the year 1990 and the introduction of political pluralism in Albania, significant changes occurred, leading to a comprehensive reform of the State Security Organs. The objective of these reforms was to align the security apparatus with the principles and requirements of the rule of law.

== Restructuring and renaming ==
In 1991, the &#x27;National Intelligence Service&#x27; was established by the enactment of Law No. 7495, dated 02.07.1991, titled &quot;On the organization of the National Intelligence Service.&quot; The main mission of this Service was to prevent, detect, and eliminate any unconstitutional activity that threatened the freedom, independence, defensive capacity, territorial integrity, and national wealth of the Republic of Albania. The creation of SHIK aimed to establish a depoliticized institution, which led to continuous modifications and adaptations over the years.

==Name after 1999 ==
In 1999, the name SHIK was changed through Decision No. 61, dated 22.11.1999, issued by the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Albania. The new name adopted for the organization was the State Intelligence Service, reflecting its evolving role. Subsequently, in 2005, Law No. 9357, dated 17.03.2005, titled &quot;On the status of the employee of the State Intelligence Service,&quot; was enacted, outlining the legal framework for the employees of the service. As the State Intelligence Service carries out its responsibilities, it places a strong emphasis on maintaining a balance between providing necessary information and respecting the rights and freedoms of individuals. The principles of legitimacy, objectivity, and confidentiality form the fundamental basis of the institution&#x27;s operations.

The National Informative Service was created by the Albanian parliament in 1991. The agency had been used to manage internal dissent and protect the interests of the individual members of the regime.

On April 1, 1997, Bashkim Fino, the Prime Minister of Albania, announced that SHIK activity would be suspended effectively from March 31. SHIK Director Bashkim Gazidede and his deputy, Bujar Rama, resigned from duty. On May 30, the president named Arben Karkini as the new head of SHIK. He was succeeded by Fatos Klosi after the Socialist Party of Albania won the July 1997 parliamentary elections. In October 1997, the Central Intelligence Agency sent a team of experts to assist the government in restructuring SHIK. In November 1999, SHIK was renamed SHISH, and the previous director was Visho Ajazi.

== Mission and function ==
The State Intelligence Service (SHISH) responsibilities include acquiring foreign intelligence and counterintelligence on issues relevant to national security. The agency is responsible for the comprehensive collection, processing, and analysis of intelligence, as well as the dissemination and utilization of intelligence products. Its duties also extend to issues related to constitutional order, particularly in fighting organized crime, illegal trafficking, and terrorism.

The State Intelligence Service has the following duties:
* Collect information from abroad for the purpose of national security.
* Undertake intelligence activities to protect integrity, independence, and constitutional order.
* Gather information on terrorist activity, the production and trafficking of narcotics, the development of weapons of mass destruction, and crimes against the environment.
* Collect information on organized crime that poses a threat to national security.

== Organization ==
The personnel of SHISH are well-trained and are assigned to six branches:
* Internal Operations Branch
* Technical Operations Branch
* Foreign Intelligence Branch
* Counter-Espionage Branch
* Counter-Organized Crime Branch
* Counter-Terrorism Branch

== Relationship with other state entities ==
Institutional Position of the State Intelligence Service and Relationship with Other State Bodies:

The State Intelligence Service operates under the authority of the Prime Minister. Its Head is appointed and dismissed by the President of the Republic upon the advice of the Prime Minister.

SHISH operates within this framework, and while it has been identified as being &quot;generally under effective civilian control&quot; (U.S. Department of State, 2004), the agency has been associated with various abuses within the country and continues to play a significant role in domestic politics. The Albanian government has received support from the U.S. and European countries in working to establish or reform national institutions, including its intelligence and security services.

==Activities by country==

===Albania===
Albania&#x27;s Minister of Defense, Mimi Kodheli, has announced that the Intelligence Service has successfully prevented some terrorist attacks. Although Kodheli did not provide specific details, it has been reported by Top Channel that the prevented attacks were related to a football match with Israel. Additionally, the meeting between CIA Director John Brennan and Minister of Defense Mimi Kodheli in Tirana during the first week of December served not only as a courtesy visit but also as an evaluation of the capabilities and services provided by the Armed Forces, particularly the Albanian Military Intelligence Service, to allied countries.

In 2018, the SHISH was exposed in a news story by journalists Borzou Daraghi and . They obtained a massive amount of data shared by SHISH with unclassified government institutions, which was later published online. The leaks revealed the existence of at least eight senior clandestine Albanian operatives, including their names, positions, salaries, and expenses, who were working in Belgium, Greece, Kosovo, Italy, Macedonia, and Serbia. The leaked files also included information about other senior, mid-level, and field operatives, as well as vehicle registrations and locations of safe houses. The SHISH initially took the data down and downplayed its significance, although they admitted that sensitive information was leaked.

===North Macedonia===
During the 2001 insurgency in Macedonia, there were allegations that the State Intelligence Service (SHISH) and the CIA provided support to the National Liberation Army (NLA) by supplying them with arms and tanks. However, the Albanian president at the time denied any involvement in the conflict in Macedonia.

<doc id="296416" wikidata="Q210907" url="?curid=296416" title="Haida Gwaii">
<text>Haida Gwaii (; / , literally &quot;Islands of the Haida people&quot;), also known as the Queen Charlotte Islands, is an archipelago located between off the northern Pacific coast in the Canadian province of British Columbia. The islands are separated from the mainland to the east by the shallow Hecate Strait. Queen Charlotte Sound lies to the south, with Vancouver Island beyond. To the north, the disputed Dixon Entrance separates Haida Gwaii from the Alexander Archipelago in the U.S. state of Alaska.

Haida Gwaii consists of two main islands: Graham Island () in the north and Moresby Island (, or &quot;Islands of Beauty&quot;) in the south, along with approximately 400 smaller islands with a total landmass of . Other major islands include Anthony Island (), Burnaby Island (), Langara Island (), Lyell Island (), Louise Island, (), Alder Island and Kunghit Island ().

On June 3, 2010, the &quot;Haida Gwaii Reconciliation Act&quot; formally renamed the archipelago to Haida Gwaii as part of the Kunst&#x27;aa guu – Kunst&#x27;aayah Reconciliation Protocol between British Columbia and the Haida people. 
The previous official name Queen Charlotte Islands was given by British explorer George Dixon in 1787 and the islands are known colloquially as &quot;the Charlottes&quot;. 

The islands, upon which people have lived for 13,000 years, form the heartland of the Haida Nation. Members of the Haida Nation currently make up approximately half of the islands&#x27; population. The Council of the Haida Nation (CHN, ) was established in 1974 to &quot;strive for full independence, sovereignty and self-sufficiency of the Haida Nation&quot;. As recently as 2015, the Haida Nation hosted First Nations delegations such as the potlatch and subsequent treaty signing between the Haida and Heiltsuk Nation. A small number of Kaigani Haida also live on the traditionally Tlingit Prince of Wales Island in Alaska. In a deal negotiated between the government and the Haida nation over the preceding decades, British Columbia in 2024 transferred the title over more than 200 islands off Canada&#x27;s west coast to the Haida people, recognizing the nation&#x27;s aboriginal land title throughout Haida Gwaii.

Some of the islands are protected under federal legislation as the Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site, which includes the southernmost part of Moresby Island and several adjoining islands and islets. Coastal temperate rain forest at the shore, the preserve also includes the San Cristoval Mountains, so named by the first European explorer, Juan José Pérez Hernández, and the oldest surviving European place name on the BC coast. Facilities are minimal, and access is via boat or seaplane. Also protected, but under provincial jurisdiction, are several provincial parks, the largest of which is Naikoon Provincial Park on northeastern Graham Island. The islands are home to an abundance of wildlife, including a large subspecies of black bear (&quot;Ursus americanus carlottae&quot;), and the smallest subspecies of ermine, the Haida ermine (&quot;Mustela haidarum haidarum&quot;), both endemic to the islands. Black-tailed deer, elk, beaver, muskrat, two species of rats, and raccoon are introduced species of mammals that have become abundant, imparting many ecological changes to the ecosystem.

There is no public transportation on Haida Gwaii. Taxis and car rentals are available, and shuttles can be arranged.

The primary transportation links between the Islands and mainland British Columbia are through the Sandspit Airport, the Masset Airport and the BC Ferries terminal at Skidegate.

The westernmost leg of Highway 16 connects Masset and Skidegate on Graham Island, and Skidegate with Prince Rupert on the mainland via regular BC Ferries service by the MV &quot;Northern Adventure&quot;. Reservations are strongly recommended for the ferry.

There is also regular BC Ferries service between Skidegate and Alliford Bay on Moresby Island. Floatplane services connect to facilities such as the Alliford Bay Water Aerodrome and Masset Water Aerodrome.

There are of highway on Graham Island. On Moresby, only of paved road line the coast.

== Economy ==
The economy is mixed, including art and natural resources, primarily logging and commercial fishing. Furthermore, service industries and government jobs provide about one-third of the jobs, and tourism has become a more prominent part of the economy in recent years, especially for fishing and tour guides, cycling, camping, and adventure tourism. Aboriginal culture tourism has been enhanced with the establishment of the Haida Heritage Centre at Kaay Ilnygaay.

== Education ==
Public education is provided through School District 50 Haida Gwaii, which operates elementary and secondary schools in Masset, Port Clements, Daajing Giids (formerly called Queen Charlotte), Sandspit, and Skidegate. The Old Masset Village Council operates Chief Matthews School, a K/4 through grade 5 (and grade 6 as of the 2023-24 school year) school. Higher education programs are offered at the Haida Heritage Centre in partnership with the University of Northern British Columbia, and with the Haida Gwaii Higher Education Society.

== Health care ==
Publicly funded health services are provided by Northern Health, the regional health authority responsible for the northern half of the province.

Haida Gwaii is served by two hospitals, The Northern Haida Gwaii Hospital and Health Centre in Masset and the Haida Gwaii Hospital in Daajing Giids which was completed in fall 2015.

Haida Gwaii has four British Columbia Ambulance stations. They are staffed by approximately 36 casual emergency medical responders (EMR), and one part-time community paramedic based in Masset.

== Population ==
At the time of European contact in 1774, the population was roughly 30,000 people, residing in several towns and including slave populations drawn from other clans of Haida as well as from other nations. It is estimated that ninety percent of the population died during the 1800s from smallpox alone; other diseases arrived as well, including typhoid, measles, and syphilis, affecting many more inhabitants. The 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic alone killed over 70% of the Haida people.

By 1900, only 350 people remained. Towns were abandoned as people left their homes for the towns of Skidegate and Masset, for cannery towns on the mainland, or for Vancouver Island. Today, around 4,500 people live on the islands. About 70% of the indigenous people (Haida) live in two communities at Skidegate and Old Massett, with a population of about 700 each. In total the Haida make up 45% of the population of the islands.

Anthony Island and the Ninstints Haida village site were made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006; in the decision, the decline in population wrought by disease was referenced when citing the &quot;vanished civilization&quot; of the Haida.

== History ==

Haida Gwaii is considered by archaeologists as an option for a Pacific coastal route taken by the first humans migrating to the Americas from the Bering Strait. At this time Haida Gwaii was likely not an island, but connected to Vancouver Island and the mainland via the now-submerged continental shelf.

It is unclear how people arrived on Haida Gwaii, but archaeological sites have established human habitation on the islands as far back as 13,000 years ago. Populations that formerly inhabited Beringia expanded into northern North America after the Last Glacial Maximum, and gave rise to Eskimo-Aleuts and Na-Dené Indians.

Although unsubstantiated, an oral tradition told by the Haida Chief, Albert Edward Edenshaw, says that the Haida came from northern Alaska and travelled to Haida Gwaii in search of new territory.

Underwater archaeologists from the University of Victoria are seeking to confirm that stone structures discovered in 2014 on the seabed of Hecate Strait may date back 13,700 or more years ago and be the earliest known signs of human habitation in Canada. Coastal sites of this era are now deep underwater.

=== Pre-colonial era ===
The coastal migration hypothesis of the settlement of the Americas suggests that the first North Americans may have been here as the oldest human remains known from Alaska or Canada are from On Your Knees Cave. Anthropologists have found striking parallels between the myths, rituals, and dwelling types of the Koryaks—inhabitants of the Kamchatka Peninsula—and those of the native peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. At this time the island was twice as large as today. There is strong genetic evidence for these early people having an origin there. The Koryaks were a matrilineal seafaring people hunting whales and other marine mammals. Kujkynnjaku, the Raven, is their primary deity. Most of the Raven myths are similar to those of the Koryak.

The group of people inhabiting these Islands developed a culture made rich by the abundance of the land and sea. These people became the Haida. The Haida are a linguistically-distinct group, and they have a complex class and rank system consisting of two main clans, the Eagles and Ravens.
Links and diversity within the Haida Nation were gained through a cross lineal marriage system between the clans. This system was also important for the transfer of wealth within the Nation, with each clan reliant on the other for the building of longhouses, the carving of totem poles and other items of cultural importance.

Noted seafarers, the Haida occupied more than 100 villages throughout the Islands. The Haida were skilled traders, with established trade links with their neighbouring First Nations on the mainland to California.
The Haida people regularly took slaves from their wars with other peoples around them.

=== Colonial era ===

The archipelago was first sighted by Europeans in 1774 by Juan Pérez, at Langara Island,in 1778 by James Cook and in 1786 by Lapérouse. In 1794, the Haida captured and sank two American maritime fur trade vessels seeking to acquire sea otter pelts, &quot;Ino&quot;, under captain Simon Metcalfe, which was captured in Houston Stewart Channel near Ninstints, and &quot;Resolution&quot;, captured near Cumshewa Inlet. In both cases only one crewmember survived. In 1851, the Haida captured the &quot;Georgiana&quot;, a ship carrying gold prospectors, and held its crew for ransom for nearly two months.

The islands played an important role during the maritime fur trade era of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. During most of that era the trade in the islands was dominated by Americans. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 put an end to American claims to the islands. Following the discovery of gold in the 1850s the British made efforts to exclude whatever American territorial claims might remain.

The Colony of the Queen Charlotte Islands was a British colony created by the Colonial Office in response to the increase in American marine trading activity resulting from the gold rush on Moresby Island in 1851. No separate administration or capital for the colony was ever established, as its only officer or appointee was James Douglas, who was simultaneously Governor of Vancouver Island. In essence, the colony was merged with the Vancouver Island colony for administrative purposes from the 1850s to 1866 when the Colony of Vancouver Island was merged with the mainland, which until that point was the separate Colony of British Columbia.

=== 21st century ===

==== 2012 controversy around depositing iron in the ocean ====
In July 2012, entrepreneur Russ George dispersed of iron sulphate dust into the Pacific Ocean several hundred miles west of the islands of Haida Gwaii. The Old Massett Village Council was persuaded to finance this geoengineering experiment as a &quot;salmon enhancement project&quot; with $1 million in village funds. The concept was that the formerly iron-deficient waters would produce more phytoplankton that would in turn produce more salmon. George hoped to finance the project by using the carbon sequestration effects of the new plankton as marketable carbon offsets. The project has been plagued by charges of unscientific procedures and recklessness. George contended that 100 tons of iron is negligible compared to what naturally enters the ocean.

Lawyers, environmentalists, and civil society groups are calling the dumping a &quot;blatant violation&quot; of two international moratoriums. George said that the Old Massett Village Council and its lawyers approved the effort and at least seven Canadian agencies were aware of it. In May 2013, the Haida Salmon Restoration Corporation removed George as a director of the company and ended his employment. The 2013 salmon runs increased from 50 million to 226 million fish, but research conducted on 13 major iron-fertilization experiments in the open ocean since 1990 concludes that the method is unproven, and with respect to the Haida Gwaii project, &quot;scientists have seen no evidence that the experiment worked&quot;.

==== 2024 Haida nation title deal ====
In a deal negotiated between the government and the Haida nation over the preceding decades, British Columbia in 2024 transferred the title over more than 200 islands off Canada&#x27;s west coast to the Haida people, recognizing the nation&#x27;s aboriginal land title throughout Haida Gwaii. The deal was the first of its kind in Canada.

On 17 February, 2025, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Haida Nation President Gaagwiis Jason Alsop signed the agreement at a public ceremony at Skidegate.

== Naming ==
 In 1787 Captain George Dixon surveyed the islands. He named the islands the Queen Charlotte Islands after his ship, the &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;, which was named after Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of King George III of the United Kingdom.

Another name, &quot;Washington&#x27;s Isles,&quot; was commonly used by American traders, who frequented the islands in the days of the marine fur trade and considered the islands part of the US-claimed Oregon Country. Following the 1846 Oregon Treaty, which established the current international borders and made the islands definitively part of the British empire, the &quot;Queen Charlotte Islands&quot; name became official.

On December 11, 2009, the British Columbia government announced that legislation would be introduced in mid-2010 to officially rename the Queen Charlotte Islands to the new name &quot;Haida Gwaii&quot;. The legislation received royal assent on June 3, 2010, formalizing the name change. At an official Giving Back the Name ceremony, the name, written on a piece of paper and placed in a bentwood box, was handed to the premier of British Columbia. This name change is officially recognized by all levels of Canadian governments, and also by the United States&#x27; National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency name database. The name &#x27; is a modern coinage and was created in the early 1980s as an alternative to the colonial-era name &quot;Queen Charlotte Islands&quot;, to recognize the history of the Haida people. &quot;Haida Gwaii&quot; means &quot;islands of the people&quot;, while &#x27; on its own means not only &quot;us&quot; but also &quot;people&quot;.

Still in use is the older name &#x27; or, in alternative orthography, &#x27;, meaning &quot;islands at the boundary of the world&quot;. &quot;&quot; (&quot;worlds&quot;) refers here to the sea and sky.

== Environment ==

Research by Simon Fraser University concludes that Haida Gwaii around 55,000 BCE was likely covered with tundra and low meadows that were populated by grazing mammals including caribou and mammoths. Although no mammoth or mastodon fossils were found, the research discovered dung-eating fungi underground in ancient peat by the Cape Ball site in Naikoon Provincial Park on Graham Island. The tundra-like landscape then evolved to a mix of alpine forest and meadows.

The last Pleistocene glaciation receded from the archipelago about 16,000 BCE, about 2,000 years earlier than the rest of the British Columbia Coast&#x27;s ice age. That, and its subsequent isolation from the mainland, encouraged Haida indigenous and environmental activists in the 1970s to use the term &quot;Galápagos of the North&quot;, a unique biocultural zone with many endemic plants and animals. The climate of this temperate north hemisphere forested region, like that of much of the British Columbia and Alaskan coast in the area, is moderated by the North Pacific Current, with heavy rainfall and relatively mild temperatures throughout the year.

The islands are home to the Taan Forest, with a wide variety of large trees, including the Sitka spruce, western red cedar, yellow cedar (Nootka cypress), shore pine, western hemlock, mountain hemlock, western yew and red alder. The &quot;Flora of the Queen Charlotte Islands&quot; describes plants from the islands.

Soils are variable. Peat is common in poorly drained flats and even on sloping ground in the wetter areas. Where drainage is good, the mature soils are podzols that have classic development (well defined eluvial horizon, Ae under Canadian classification) in undisturbed areas. A history of disturbance, as from logging or windthrow, sees the Ae mixed with other horizons and only patchily visible.
Kiidk&#x27;yaas (Golden Spruce), a naturally occurring genetic-variant yellow-colour Sitka spruce tree, was near the Yakoun River, the largest on Graham Island. It was a popular tourist attraction until it was illegally cut down in 1997 as a protest against the industrial logging practices.

From the spring of 1996 until November 30, 1997, a popular attraction for tourists to the islands was a male albino white raven. He lived around Port Clements and would commonly be seen taking food handouts from locals and visitors alike. He died after making contact with an electrical transformer. The white raven was preserved by former Port Clements residents, taxidermists Roger Britten Sr. and Jr., and is on display in the Port Clements Historical Society&#x27;s museum.

== Climate ==
The climate is oceanic (&quot;Cfb&quot;), except near the summit of Mount Moresby where the climate is subpolar oceanic (&quot;Cfc&quot;). It is very similar to the climate of the west coast of Scotland in terms of average temperatures and total year-round precipitation, but the latitude is lower than the west coast of Scotland; it is 52° 39&#x27;, the same as southern Ireland.

In the relatively shielded areas around Tlell and Sandspit annual rainfall averages from to . Average monthly precipitation is markedly concentrated from October to January, with December the wettest month, averaging about , most of which is rain, though snow is possible. May through July represent a markedly drier season; July, the driest month, averages about of rain.

Snowfall is generally moderate, averaging from to , though at northerly Langara Island, it averages around .

Precipitation is typically extremely frequent (especially from autumn to mid-winter), occurring on around two-thirds of all days even in relatively shielded areas, and direct sunlight is scarce, averaging around 3 to 4 hours per day.

== Geology ==

=== Earthquake hazards ===

The islands are located along the Queen Charlotte Fault, an active transform fault that produces significant earthquakes every 3–30 years. This is the result of the converging of the Pacific and North American Plates along the archipelago&#x27;s west coast. Major earthquakes have occurred in the Haida Gwaii in 1949 and 2012. Though the region is prone to fair geological activity, there is little infrastructure set up to gather accurate information to warn locals of possible threats. Many residents, notably from First Nations communities, have been critical of the fact that they must rely on information coming from neighbouring American states such as Washington or Alaska and from the USGS (United States Geological Survey). Regardless of the inconsistencies, Environment Canada does regularly do field tests across the Pacific coast of British Columbia relating to this matter.

The Cascadia subduction zone does pose some additional earthquake risks, but, most importantly, the subduction zone poses direct tsunami risks to the coastal settlements on the western side of the islands.

== Culture ==
=== Visual arts ===

The artwork known as &quot;Spirit of Haida Gwaii&quot;, by Bill Reid, is featured on the reverse of Canadian $20 bills produced between 2004 and 2011. It depicts a Haida chief in a canoe, accompanied by the mythic messengers Raven, Frog and Eagle (the first casting of this sculpture, &quot;Spirit of Haida Gwaii: The Black Canoe&quot;, is on display in the atrium of the Canadian Embassy in Washington DC, the other, &quot;Spirit of Haida Gwaii: the Jade Canoe&quot;, is on display in Vancouver Airport). Haida art is also frequently seen on large monumental-sized cedar totem poles and dugout canoes, hand-crafted gold and silver jewellery, and even as cartoons in the form of Haida manga.

=== Repatriation of cultural property ===
The Buxton Museum and Art Gallery in England repatriated items in its collection to the Haida people. The Museum returned the items as part of its initiative to return Native American and First Nation artefacts.

=== Haida language ===

The Haida language was proposed for classification as part of the Na-Dene family of languages on the basis of a few similarities with Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit. Many linguists, however, consider the evidence insufficient and continue to regard Haida as a language isolate. All 50 remaining speakers of Haida are over 70 years old. Telus and Gwaii Trust recently completed a project to bring broadband internet to the island via a microwave relay. This enables interactive research to be carried out on the more than 80 CDs of language, story and spoken history of the people.

=== In popular culture ===

* Haida Gwaii has been featured in &quot;The Nature of Things&quot; documentaries since the 1970s due to its unique forest and ecosystem.

<text>Rumelia (; ; ) was the name of a historical region in Southeastern Europe that was administered by the Ottoman Empire, roughly corresponding to the Balkans. In its wider sense, it was used to refer to all Ottoman possessions and vassals in Europe. These would later be geopolitically classified as &quot;the Balkans&quot;, although Hungary and Moldova are sometimes excluded. During the period of its existence, Rumelia was more often known in English as [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] in Europe.

==Etymology==
&quot;Rûm&quot; in this context means &#x27;Roman&#x27; and &quot;ėli&quot; means &#x27;land&#x27;, and thus &quot;Rumelia&quot; (, &quot;Rūm-ėli&quot;; Turkish: &quot;Rumeli&quot;) means &#x27;Land of the Romans&#x27; in Ottoman Turkish. It refers to the lands conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, which formerly belonged to the Byzantine Empire, known by its contemporaries as the Roman Empire. Although the term &quot;Byzantine Empire&quot; is used by modern historians, the empire&#x27;s citizens and emperors called themselves Romans, meaning Greek-speaking Eastern Romans, and embraced a Christian identity. Various languages in the Balkans have long used the descriptor &quot;Roman&quot; to refer to the lands of the former Eastern Roman Empire. The term survives in several languages in the region: ; , &quot;Rumeliya&quot;; , &quot;Romylía&quot;, or Ρούμελη, &quot;Roúmeli&quot;; Macedonian; and , ; as well . The old Latin documents in Genoa use the term &quot;Romania&quot;, the common name for the Byzantine Empire during the Middle Ages.

Originally, the Seljuks used the name &quot;Land of the Rûm&quot; (Romans) to define Anatolia, which the armies of the Seljuk Empire gradually conquered from the Byzantine Empire after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate was called the Sultanate of Rum by its contemporaries, meaning the &quot;Sultanate of the Roman Empire&quot; or &quot;Roman Sultanate&quot;, which mostly covered central Anatolia until the Battle of Köse Dağ in 1243. Anatolia was referred to as Land of the Christians, hence Rum. Afterwards, it was replaced by the Anatolian beyliks, among which the Ottoman Beylik rose to prominence in the 14th and 15th centuries and eventually became the Ottoman Empire.

However, following the expansion of the Ottoman Empire into Anatolia and the Balkans in the second half of the 14th century and after the conquest of Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 1453 by Mehmed II, the term &quot;Rumeli&quot; came to apply exclusively to the Balkan region of the Ottoman Empire. The region remained primarily populated by Christians; though gradually, the Albanians, Bosniaks and Pomaks, as well as many Greeks, Serbs, Bulgarians and Vlachs, converted to Islam.

Many grand viziers, viziers, pashas and beylerbeyis were originally from Rumelia.

==Geography==
Rumelia included the provinces of Thrace, Macedonia and Moesia, which are now Bulgaria and Turkish Thrace, bounded to the north by the rivers Sava and Danube, west by the Adriatic coast and south by the Morea. In the beginning the main town was the city of Plovdiv, then Sofia. The name &quot;Rumelia&quot; was ultimately applied to a province composed of central Albania and northwestern Macedonia, with Bitola being the main town.

Following the administrative reorganization made by the Ottoman government between 1870 and 1875, the name &quot;Rumelia&quot; ceased to correspond to any political division. Eastern Rumelia was constituted as an autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire by the Treaty of Berlin (1878), but on September 6, 1885, after a bloodless revolution, it was united with Bulgaria. The Kosovo Vilayet was created in 1877.

In Turkey, the word &quot;Trakya&quot; (Thrace) has now mostly replaced &quot;Rumeli&quot; (Rumelia) to refer to the part of Turkey that is in Europe (the provinces of Edirne, Kırklareli, Tekirdağ, the northern part of Çanakkale Province and the western part of Istanbul Province). However, &quot;Rumelia&quot; remains in use in historical contexts and is still used in the context of the culture of the current Turkish populations of the Balkans and the descendants of Turkish immigrants from the Balkans. The region in Turkey is also referred to as Eastern Thrace, or Turkish Thrace. In Greece, the term () has been used since Ottoman times to refer to Central Greece, especially when it is juxtaposed with the Peloponnese or Morea. The word &quot;Rumeli&quot; is also used in some cases, mostly in Istanbul, to refer exclusively to the part of Istanbul Province that is west of the Bosphorus strait.

<text>CSS &quot;McRae&quot; was a Confederate gunboat that saw service during the American Civil War. Displacing around 680 tons, she was armed with one smoothbore and six smoothbore cannon.

Originally operating as a rebel ship under the Mexican flag with the name &quot;Marqués de la Havana&quot;, the wooden sloop was captured as a pirate ship by the United States Navy sloop-of-war during the Battle of Anton Lizardo on 6 March 1860. A construction plan authorizing the building of ten fast gunboats was funded by the Congress of the Confederate States on 15 March 1861. Recognizing that no yard could turn out the vessels fast enough, Confederate States Secretary of the Navy Stephen R. Mallory sent a commission to New Orleans, Louisiana, to convert existing steamers to commerce raiders. The Confederate States Navy purchased &quot;Marqués de la Havana&quot; at New Orleans on 17 March 1861, and duly fitted her out as CSS &quot;McRae&quot; as part of this plan. Extensive engine repairs prevented &quot;McRae&quot; from going to sea before the arrival of the Union blockading force.

Placed under the command of Lieutenant Thomas B. Huger, &quot;McRae&quot; served as part of Flag Officer George N. Hollins&#x27; defense of the lower reaches of the Mississippi River, and provided cover for blockade runners. This led to &quot;McRae&quot; seeing combat with the Union blockading force on 12 October 1861. &quot;McRae&quot; took part in the Battle of the Head of Passes as part of Hollins′ &quot;mosquito fleet,&quot; driving the Union blockading forces from the Head of Passes in the Mississippi Delta.

&quot;McRae&quot; again saw action on 24 April 1862 as the Union fleet attempted to pass Fort Jackson and Fort Saint Philip and reach New Orleans. In the resulting Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, &quot;McRae&quot; suffered little damage in the beginning due to her resemblance to the Union &quot;Unadilla&quot;-class gunboats. The leading Union ships passed by her without firing. The sloop-of-war was an exception, and replied to &quot;McRae&quot;′s gunfire with an 11-inch (279-mm) shell that set fire to &quot;McRae&quot;″s sail room and threatened her magazines. The officers and crew fought hard in this latter engagement but suffered severe casualties (Huger being amongst those mortally wounded), and &quot;McRae&quot; herself was severely damaged. She was run against the shore to put out her fires, and remained there till dawn, after which she returned to the forts. Loaded with wounded from the forts, &quot;McRae&quot; was allowed to return to New Orleans on 27 April 1862 under a flag of truce. After landing the wounded at the city, her crew scuttled and abandoned her at Algiers, Louisiana (now a neighborhood of New Orleans), after cutting all her steam pipes.

James Morris Morgan, a Midshipmen on the &quot;McRae&quot; gave a personal account of the battle and the &quot;McRae&quot;&#x27;s end: &quot;The &quot;McRae&quot; was in the thick of the fight. Her sides riddled. Heavy projectiles had knocked her guns off the carriages and rolled them along the deck crunching the dead and wounded. Her deck was a perfect shambles. When day broke the McRae was the only thing afloat with the Confederate flag flying.&quot; In the battle, Captain Huger had been mortally wounded and LT. &quot;Savez&quot; Read taken command. &quot;Admiral Farragut, with his flagship the Hartford, was by this time at the Quarantine Station, about four miles above the forts. Read sent the only boat he had that would float over to the Hartford to tell Admiral Farragut the condition of his vessel and the difficulty he was having to keep her afloat--that he did not have a gun left on a carriage, and no one to care for his dying captain or the many other wounded. Farragut gave him permission to proceed to New Orleans, saying that he would tell him there what disposition he would make of the ship. When we arrived at New Orleans &quot;McRae&quot; was leaking like a sieve; the exhausted remnant of the crew refused to continue at the pumps, and as the last wounded men were taken out of the ship--down she went.&quot;

<text>The South London Theatre is a community theatre housed in a Grade II listed former fire station, in West Norwood in the London Borough of Lambeth, England. The first play opened in October 1967, and it is now a busy theatrical venue, presenting more than 22 shows annually in its theatre space, which was remodelled during refurbishment of the Old Fire Station during the period 2015–2018. The theatre facilities also consist of two dedicated rehearsal spaces, an entire floor of wardrobe rooms and a private basement bar, open Sunday to Friday evenings to audiences and members and which plays host to regular social events.

The adult theatre group welcomes both Full Members (participatory) and Friends of SLT (audience supporters) and stages productions across genres, including Shakespeare, theatrical classics, comedy, pantomime, musicals and modern cutting-edge drama. New writing is particularly encouraged, as are aspiring directors. All involvement at the theatre is on a volunteer basis with support and basic training provided as required.

Additionally, there is an active youth group (known as the &quot;SLT Youth Theatre&quot;) offering classes for young people aged 7–18yrs, on Saturdays during term time. The youth have their own showcases and are also encouraged to participate in the productions of the adult group.

The South London Theatre is a member of the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain.

==Theatre building==
The Gothic revival style former fire station was probably designed by the architect Robert Pearsall at the Metropolitan Board of Works Architect&#x27;s Department and was built in 1881. It remains a rare example of a fire station built for horse-drawn tenders which still has the look-out tower and original doors in place. Its history as a fire station was short however, as motorised fire appliances, introduced in the early 20th century were too big for its doors, which could not be practicably extended, and the fire station ceased to function as such in 1917. Between 1917 and 1967, the building was used mainly as a church hall for the neighbouring St Luke&#x27;s Church.

The original design for the conversion to a theatre was by Owen Luder (later to become President of the Royal Institute of British Architects on two occasions). The original theatre was traditional proscenium arch in style, with a fly loft requiring the removal of a floor in part of the first storey. The auditorium had raked seating with a capacity of just under 100. The space was known as Bell Theatre.

In February 1975 a small studio theatre was added in a single storey extension at the South end of the building for &quot;productions which would not fit into the usual theatre pattern.&quot; This space was known as Prompt Corner.

Following refurbishment, the theatre now has one large theatre space and several rooms which are available to hire, when not in use by the community group. South London Theatre participates each September in Open House London in order to open to the public for tours.
== Refurbishment ==
Funds including a National Lottery Heritage Fund grant were secured in 2014 to refurbish the building, making it fully accessible and restoring much of the Victorian character; opening its original main front doors for the first time in 100 years. These doors had been boarded and secured in the Owen Luder design, forming the rear boundary to the Bell Theatre stage space.

Whilst the building was significantly remodelled, the community theatre relocated to Stanley Halls in South Norwood and Youth Group performances were staged in St Luke&#x27;s Church next door.

In April 2018, the first production was staged in the new and enlarged black box theatre, as the South London Theatre community was returned to West Norwood and the building reopened.

During refurbishment, the theatre spaces were combined and reworked to create the new theatre space and a generous foyer. The fly loft was closed over to reform the floor on the first storey, the earlier single storey extension housing Prompt Corner was demolished, and a four-storey extension added in its footprint, to accommodate part of the new theatre space, along with the technical gallery, props store, toilet facilities and a second staircase to all floors. A lift shaft was also added to the rear of the building. All spaces were then sensitively restored and redecorated, with rooms on the fourth floor named Prompt and Bell in recognition of the former performance spaces. Other rooms have been named The Watch Room and The Kit Room in recognition of their former functions and the building&#x27;s fire station heritage.

<text>In electrical engineering, admittance is a measure of how easily a circuit or device will allow a current to flow. It is defined as the reciprocal of impedance, analogous to how conductance and resistance are defined. The SI unit of admittance is the siemens (symbol S); the older, synonymous unit is mho, and its symbol is ℧ (an upside-down uppercase omega Ω). Oliver Heaviside coined the term &quot;admittance&quot; in December 1887. Heaviside used to represent the magnitude of admittance, but it quickly became the conventional symbol for admittance itself through the publications of Charles Proteus Steinmetz. Heaviside probably chose simply because it is next to in the alphabet, the conventional symbol for impedance.

Admittance , measured in siemens, is defined as the inverse of impedance , measured in ohms:

formula_1

Resistance is a measure of the opposition of a circuit to the flow of a steady current, while impedance takes into account not only the resistance but also dynamic effects (known as reactance). Likewise, admittance is not only a measure of the ease with which a steady current can flow, but also the dynamic effects of the material&#x27;s susceptance to polarization:

formula_2

where 
* is the admittance (siemens);
* is the conductance (siemens);
* is the susceptance (siemens); and
* , the imaginary unit.

The dynamic effects of the material&#x27;s susceptance relate to the universal dielectric response, the power law scaling of a system&#x27;s admittance with frequency under alternating current conditions.

==Conversion from impedance to admittance==

The impedance, , is composed of real and imaginary parts,
formula_3
where
* is the resistance (ohms); and
* is the reactance (ohms).

formula_4

Admittance, just like impedance, is a complex number, made up of a real part (the conductance, ), and an imaginary part (the susceptance, ), thus:

formula_5

where (conductance) and (susceptance) are given by:

formula_6

The magnitude and phase of the admittance are given by:

formula_7

where 
* is the conductance, measured in siemens; and
* is the susceptance, also measured in siemens.

Note that (as shown above) the signs of reactances become reversed in the admittance domain; i.e. capacitive susceptance is positive and inductive susceptance is negative.

== Shunt admittance in electrical power systems modeling ==
In the context of electrical modeling of transformers and transmission lines, shunt components that provide paths of least resistance in certain models are generally specified in terms of their admittance. Each side of most transformer models contains shunt components which model magnetizing current and core losses. These shunt components can be referenced to the primary or secondary side. For simplified transformer analysis, admittance from shunt elements can be neglected. When shunt components have non-negligible effects on system operation, the shunt admittance must be considered. In the diagram below, all shunt admittances are referred to the primary side. The real and imaginary components of the shunt admittance, conductance and susceptance, are represented by and , respectively.
Transmission lines can span hundreds of kilometers, over which the line&#x27;s capacitance can affect voltage levels. For short length transmission line analysis, which applies to lines shorter than , this capacitance can be ignored and shunt components are not necessary in the model. Lines from , generally considered to be in the medium-line category, contain a shunt admittance governed by
formula_8
where

* is the total shunt admittance;
* is the shunt admittance per unit length;
* is the length of the transmission line; and
* is the capacitance of the line.

<doc id="296429" wikidata="Q7245880" url="?curid=296429" title="Prison–industrial complex">
<text>The prison–industrial complex (PIC) is a term, coined after the &quot;military-industrial complex&quot; of the 1950s, used by scholars and activists to describe the many relationships between institutions of imprisonment (such as prisons, jails, detention facilities, and psychiatric hospitals) and the various businesses that benefit from them.

The term is most often used in the context of the contemporary United States, where the expansion of the U.S. inmate population has resulted in economic profit and political influence for private prisons and other companies that supply goods and services to government prison agencies. According to this concept, incarceration not only upholds the justice system, but also subsidizes construction companies, companies that operate prison food services and medical facilities, surveillance and corrections technology vendors, corporations that contract cheap prison labor, correctional officers unions, private probation companies, criminal lawyers, and the lobby groups that represent them. The term also refers more generally to interest groups who, in their interactions with the prison system, prioritize financial gain over rehabilitating criminals.

Proponents of this concept, including civil rights organizations such as the Rutherford Institute and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), believe that the economic incentives of prison construction, prison privatization, prison labor, and prison service contracts have transformed incarceration into an industry capable of growth, and have contributed to mass incarceration. These advocacy groups note that incarceration affects people of color at disproportionately high rates.

Many commentators use the term &quot;prison-industrial complex&quot; to refer strictly to private prisons in the United States, an industry that generates approximately $4 billion in profit a year. Others note that fewer than 10% of U.S. inmates are incarcerated in for-profit facilities, and use the term to diagnose a larger confluence of interests between the U.S. government, at the federal and state levels, and the private businesses that profit from the increasing surveillance, policing, and imprisonment of the American public since approximately 1980.

== History ==
Early American jails were largely privately managed, holding both criminals awaiting trial and debtors awaiting repayment, and charging holding fees to local governments and creditors. After the first publicly-run prison was established in 1790 in Pennsylvania, private business involvement in corrections largely diminished to providing contracted services, such as food preparation, medical care, and transportation. The major 19th-century exception to the relative separation between public punishment and private industry was the convict lease system in the American South, in which private parties paid public prisons for forced prisoner labor.

During the mass unemployment of the Great Depression, business leaders and unions successfully pressured the federal government to prohibit private corporations from contracting cheap prison labor and undercutting competition. In 1930, the federal government established Federal Prison Industries, a prison labor program to produce goods and services for the public sector.

Many scholars and activists argue that the contemporary prison-industrial complex has its origins in the War on Drugs, a legislative campaign orchestrated by the U.S. federal government since the early 1970s aimed at criminalizing and punishing drug trafficking and use. Following tougher anti-drug legislation and harsher sentencing standards under the presidential administrations of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, incarceration increasingly became the standard punishment for non-violent offenses. As the overall incarcerated population dramatically increased, new correctional facilities needed to be built, staffed, and maintained, and private-sector prisons began to emerge as cost-effective solutions. Also during this period private-sector wage labor was reintroduced into the national prison system.

The number of Americans awaiting trial or serving a sentence for a drug conviction in prison or jail increased from about 40,000 in 1980 to about 450,000 in 2004. In May 2021 the Federal Bureau of Prisons listed 46.3 percent of federal inmates as incarcerated because of drug convictions.

=== 1970s ===
In 1973, following the lead of President Nixon, New York State passed the Rockefeller Drug Laws, establishing mandatory minimum prison sentences for small-scale drug possession. Although not as harsh as Governor Nelson Rockefeller had originally called for, these laws inspired other states to enact similarly strict punishments for drug offenses, including mandatory minimum sentences in almost every instance. Also in 1973, conservative businesses and tough-on-crime politicians came together to establish the influential lobbying group American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).

In 1977, the U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union&quot; restricted prisoners’ First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly, and prohibited them from organizing labor unions. In 1979, inspired by legislation proposed by ALEC, the U.S. Congress overturned the New Deal–era legislation against for-profit prison labor by establishing the Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program (PIE). Intended to allow inmates to contribute to society, offset the cost of their incarceration, reduce idleness, cultivate job skills, and improve the rates of successful transition back into their communities after release, the PIE program created a cheap captive domestic labor market, which set the stage for the adoption and expansion of private-sector labor in public prisons. The PIE program also allowed prisons themselves to be privatized and operated as for-profit entities.

Meanwhile, incarceration rates began to soar. After a period of relative stability since 1925 (around 0.1 percent of the population), the overall U.S. imprisonment rate grew rapidly and continuously from 1972, increasing annually by 6 to 8 percent through 2000.

=== 1980s ===
President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act further accelerated mass incarceration. Very shortly many state prisons were experiencing unprecedented overcrowding. Rockefeller&#x27;s successor, New York Governor Mario Cuomo, was unable to generate enough support to dismantle the drug laws, and to keep pace with increasing arrests, was forced to expand the prison system using the Urban Development Corporation, a public state agency, which could issue state bonds without voter support. Despite a general economic retrenchment and avowed state government austerity policies, these events proved that government funds could nevertheless be made available for prison construction.

Meanwhile, in 1983, the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) was founded by Nashville businessmen who claimed they could build and operate state and federal prisons with the same quality of service provided by government prisons, but at a lower cost. In 1984, CCA was awarded a contract for a facility in Hamilton County, Tennessee, the first instance of the public sector contracting management of a prison to a private company. By 1987, the company had signed more contracts, with Tennessee, Texas, and Kentucky, establishing the legal precedent for other startups and established corporations to enter into the industry, not only operating prisons but also immigrant detention facilities for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. As of 2012, the multibillion-dollar corporation, now known as CoreCivic, manages over 65 correctional facilities and boasts an annual revenue exceeding $1.7 billion.

In 1988, the now-second-largest for-profit private prison corporation, Wackenhut Corrections Corporation (WCC) was established as a subsidiary of The Wackenhut Corporation. The WCC is now known as GEO Group, and as of 2017, their U.S. Corrections and Detention division manages 70 correctional and detention facilities.

Between 1980 and 1989, the total U.S. prison population increased by 115%, from 329,821 to 710,054 people.

=== 1990s ===
In 1992, William Barr, then United States Attorney General, authored a report, &quot;The Case for More Incarceration&quot;, which argued for an even further increase in the United States incarceration rate. In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, the largest crime bill in U.S. history, which directly allotted a $9.7 billion funding increase to prisons and introduced the three-strikes law, assigning unprecedentedly long sentences (25 year to life minimum) to third-time convicts.

As the prison population continued to grow steeply throughout the 1990s, the profit margins of private prison corporations such as CCA and GeoGroup continued to increase. Throughout the 1990s, the CCA and GeoGroup were both significant donors to the American Legislative Exchange Council. In 1995, Congress passed another piece of ALEC-influenced legislation, the Prison Industries Act, allowing corporations to pay prison laborers less than the federal minimum wage and divert the difference to constructing facilities for further prison labor.

By the end of 1999, the U.S. had a total incarcerated population of 2,026,596. This included 71,206 prisoners held in privately operated facilities, accounting for 5.5% of state and 2.8% of federal prisoners. In 1999, nearly 43% of all sentenced inmates were African-American men, and an estimated 9% of African-American men in their late 20s were in prison.

=== 2000s ===
Through the 2000s, the federal government continued outsourcing prison management to private facilities, while states varied in their approach to private incarceration. Between 1999 and 2010, six states began using private prisons, while nine states ended their private prison contracts. By 2010, the number of privately held state prisoners in the 30 practicing states ranged from a low of 5 in South Dakota to a high of 19,155 in Texas.

Overall U.S. incarceration (prisons and jails) peaked in 2008 at 2,308,400 people, approximately 1% of the adult population.

A 2010 investigation by the United States Department of Justice found that Federal Prison Industries (the New Deal–era public-sector prison labor program, rebranded in 1977 as UNICOR) had routinely exposed federal inmates to toxic heavy metals, exported hazardous wastes to developing countries, and attempted to conceal evidence of unsafe working conditions from OSHA inspectors.

=== 2010s ===
In 2016, President Barack Obama issued an executive policy to reduce the number of private federal prison contracts, and the United States Justice Department began developing a plan to phase out its use of private prisons. Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates rationalized this decision: &quot;Private prisons simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources; they do not save substantially on costs; and as noted in a recent report by the Department&#x27;s Office of Inspector General, they do not maintain the same level of safety and security.&quot;

Both the GEO Group and CoreCivic donated heavily to the Donald Trump presidential campaign in 2016 and inaugural committee in 2017, and following his election, their stock prices skyrocketed: CoreCivic by 140% and GEO Group by 98%. Less than a month into the Trump administration, Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Obama directive curtailing the Federal Bureau of Prisons&#x27; private prison contracts, stating that the Obama administration had &quot;impaired the Bureau&#x27;s ability to meet the future needs of the federal correctional system.&quot;

By the end of 2019, the U.S. incarcerated population had dropped to 2,068,800 people, its lowest level since 2003. The incarceration rate had dropped to the same rate as 1995 (810 per 100,000 adult U.S. residents), with 11% of federal and 7.6% of state prisoners incarcerated in for-profit facilities.

== Structure ==
The prison-industrial complex is an example of a complex system, comprising many institutions interacting in mutually reinforcing patterns. Minimal definitions of the system focus on the relationships between the federal and state criminal justice system; the for-profit companies that build, operate, and service public and private prisons; and the special interest groups that grow in size and influence as incarceration increases. These groups include ICE, police unions, correctional officers unions, and private probation companies, as well as private businesses that sell surveillance and corrections technology, operate prison food services and medical facilities, and private- and public-sector businesses that contract or subcontract prison labor.

More expansive definitions often include as elements of the system tough-on-crime politicians and district attorneys seeking office, conservative political lobbies and legislatures passing punitive laws, and investment banks and rural economic developers leveraging public debt into private profit through prison construction and employment contracts. The widest definitions of the prison-industrial complex include even larger and more abstract institutions and processes, such as the news media sensationalizing crime and influencing public perception, gentrification disrupting urban environments and displacing precarious residents, and public schools increasingly subjecting students to police oversight and legal punishment since the 1980s. In the U.S., the specific relationships between the criminal justice system and the private businesses that interact with it vary significantly from state to state.

Critics and scholars argue that mass incarceration is an emergent property of the prison-industrial complex. Because mass incarceration has exacerbated the economic and racial inequality in the United States, contemporary social critics like Ruth Wilson Gilmore refer to the prison-industrial complex as an infrastructure of racial capitalism.

=== The War on Drugs ===

Marc Mauer, executive director of the criminal justice reform group The Sentencing Project, has argued that the growth and expansion of the prison-industrial complex since the 1970s has its roots in the War on Drugs, which, rather than suppressing the illegal drug trade, has produced a perpetual cycle of drug dealing and imprisonment. This he attributes to a structural feature of the drug trade, a market with perpetually high demand and lucrative potential profits. Mauer describes the &quot;replacement effect&quot;, in which no matter how many drug suppliers are incarcerated, other sellers simply take their place; since there is a constant supply of new drug sellers, there is thus a constant supply of potential prison inmates. According to this view, the prison-industrial complex depends on this guarantee of future inmates to ensure its growth and profitability, making prison construction, operation, services, and technology all safe investments.

Professor Angela Davis, one of the most recognized American prison abolition activists, has argued that while some appear to believe that the prison industrial complex is taking the space once filled by the military industrial complex, the aftermath of the War on Terror shows how the links between the military, corporations, and government are growing even stronger. The relationship between these complexes, Davis suggests, shows they are symbiotic, because they mutually support and promote each other, even sharing some technologies. Further, they also share important structural features, both generating immense profits from processes of &quot;social destruction&quot; In essence, Davis argues that the relationship between the military and prison industrial complex can be understood like this: the exact things which are advantageous to corporations, elected officials, and governmental agents, those who have evident stakes in expanding these systems, leads to the devastation of poor and racialized communities as it has throughout American history.

=== Employment and recidivism ===
The U.S. criminal justice system has a high rate of recidivism. A 2021 Bureau of Justice Statistics investigation reported that about 66% of prisoners released across 24 states in 2008 were rearrested within 3 years, and 82% were rearrested within 10 years.

Statistics show that incarceration and unemployment are correlated, although unevenly. Nevertheless, such a high rate of recidivism can be attributed in part to the difficulty formerly incarcerated people encounter in finding stable employment. The Evidence-Based Professionals Society suggests two reasons for this difficulty: &quot;First, most of the offenders may simply lack the necessary job skills for specific positions, keeping them from those usually higher paid and more stable jobs. Second, many employers are reluctant to hire these people due to the stigma imposed by their previous criminal records.&quot;

=== School-to-prison pipeline ===
Scholars and critics describe the existence of a &quot;school-to-prison pipeline&quot;, a system in which public school policies contribute to funneling urban students of color into the prison-industrial complex. Students at urban schools and other schools with high percentages of minority students are more likely to experience out-of-school suspensions and academic failure, which have been correlated to a higher likelihood of incarceration after leaving school. Moreover, since the 1970s, urban public school districts have dramatically increased police presence in their schools, and students have been increasingly subject to &quot;arrests for minor noncriminal violations of school rules.&quot; This trend has both disrupted urban learning environments and decreased the average age of the incarcerated population of the United States&#x27; major cities.

=== Race ===
The War on Drugs has disproportionately impacted African Americans. Although African Americans use drugs at similar rates to Americans from other demographic groups, they are prosecuted at much higher rates.

==Economics==
In the decades following World War II, the American domestic economy was characterized by growth, but also by deindustrialization, the decline of the labor movement, austerity and the privatization of government services, the transformation of welfare to workfare policies, and suburbanization, including white flight from city centers. These large-scale transformations had particularly damaging effects on the economic activity of large American cities, generally increasing urban unemployment and exacerbating income and racial inequality. 

Statistics have shown that the unemployment rate is correlated to the incarceration rate, and American historians such as Heather Ann Thompson and Alex Lichtenstein have argued that mass incarceration has accompanied the public-sector abandonment of former urban-industrial cores, and contributed to the rise of the Sun Belt as an important economic region. In this view, the prison-industrial complex is not simply the cumulative effect of decades of increasingly punitive legislation, but is an integral sector in the neoliberal national economy, with the largest and fastest-growing states—like Florida, California, and Texas (&quot;Flocatex&quot;)—also leading the country in number of inmates and prison privatization.

=== Prison labor ===
As large-scale human holding facilities, prisons contain enormous reserves of labor power. Since the establishment of the Federal Prison Industries in 1930, these capacities have been put to work for the public sector, and since the 1979 Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program, for the private sector too. Sociologist Erin Hatton defines four types of prison labor:

# Facility maintenance jobs, in which prisoners do the upkeep and maintenance of their institutions: cooking, cleaning, laundry, landscaping, plumbing, etc. The vast majority of working prisoners perform this type of labor, earning no wages in many states, and anywhere between $0.04 and $2.00 an hour in the states where this labor is paid, averaging $0.14–$0.63 for most working inmates.
# &quot;Correctional industry&quot; jobs in the government-run prison factories launched in the 1930s. These jobs account for nearly 5% of state and federal prisoner employment, with prisoners producing a wide range of goods and services for sale to other government agencies, including library, school, and office furniture; uniforms, linens, and mattresses for prisons; metal grills and wooden benches for public parks; body armor for the military and police; road signs and license plates for transportation departments; doing data entry and staffing call centers. In Texas, Georgia, and Arkansas, state prisoners earn no wages for such labor but, on average, state and federal prisoners earn $0.33–$1.41 an hour for this work, reaching as high as $5.15 in Nevada, where the pay starts at $0.25 an hour. Every U.S. state has its own correctional industries program, and the federal prison system has a similar initiative called UNICOR. 
# Jobs with private-sector companies that have contracted with prisons for their labor, as restarted in 1979 with the PIE program. These jobs employ just 0.3% of the prison population, and are the highest-paid prison jobs by far, because private-sector companies are legally obligated to pay prisoners “prevailing wages” in order to avoid undercutting non-prison labor. However, reports suggest that prisoners are typically paid the minimum wage, not the prevailing wage, and legal loopholes allow some companies to pay even less. Moreover, prisoners&#x27; wages are subject to [...] many deductions [...] capped at a whopping 80 percent of their gross earnings. Moreover, some states have mandatory savings programs that take away another chunk of their wages. Thus, for many incarcerated workers, even free-world wages in private-sector jobs are reduced so much that they begin to resemble prison-world wages.&quot;Prison insourcing&quot; has grown in popularity over the past few decades as a cheap alternative to offshoring and outsourcing, with a wide variety of companies actively hiring or subcontracting prison labor throughout the 1990s and 2000s. 
# Jobs outside of prisons and jails through various inmate labor programs. These work-release programs, outside work crews, and work camps are more common than public and private industry jobs, but less common than facility maintenance. This category of labor is various, with prisoners performing &quot;community services&quot; like cleaning parks, or clearing homeless encampments, or fighting wildfires in California. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) serves as a federal tax credit that grants employers $2,400 for every work-release employed inmate.

Advocates of prison labor argue that rehabilitation is promoted through discipline, a strong work ethic, and providing inmates with valuable skills to be used upon release. Gina Honeycutt, executive director of the National Correctional Industries Association, stated in 2015 that moreover, &quot;in recent years, the focus of many work programs has shifted to concentrate even more on effective rehabilitation of inmates. The transition in the last five years has been away from producing a product to producing a successful offender as our product.&quot; Indeed, studies have shown that participants in prison labor programs often have a lower risk of recidivism; these studies may be misleading, however, as it is often only obedient and industrious inmates who are allowed to participate in prison labor in the first place.

Anti-prison activists have argued that corporations that contract or subcontract prison labor have a vested interest in the expansion of the prison system, since its expansion provides more inmates available for cheap labor. Activists Eve Goldberg and Linda Evans (writing while incarcerated in California) explain that For private business, prison labor is like a pot of gold. No strikes. No union organizing. No health benefits, unemployment insurance, or workers&#x27; compensation to pay. No language barriers, as in foreign countries. New leviathan prisons are being built on thousands of eerie acres of factories inside the walls. Prisoners do data entry for Chevron, make telephone reservations for TWA, raise hogs, shovel manure, make circuit boards, limousines, waterbeds, and lingerie for Victoria&#x27;s Secret—all at a fraction of the cost of &#x27;free labor.&#x27;&quot;Several scholars argue that the practice of &quot;hiring out prisoners&quot;, from the Reconstruction-era convict lease system to the contemporary prison-industrial complex, is a continuation of the U.S. history of slavery. These scholars all cite the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, abolishing the institution of slavery &quot;except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.&quot;

=== Private prisons ===
In a Bureau of Prisons (BOP)–funded study, privatized prisons were compared side-to-side with the public prisons on economic performance, and quality of life. The study found that in a trade-off for allowing prisons to be more cheaply run and operated, the degree to which prisoners are reformed goes down. Because the privatized prisons are so much larger than the public-run prisons, they were subject to economies of scale, allowing for a more efficient, lower-cost alternative to government spending on incarceration.

In 2016, GEO Group and CoreCivic each commanded $900 million in open credit from six banks: Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, U.S. Bancorp, and Wells Fargo.

In 2011, The Vera Institute of Justice surveyed 40 state correction departments to gather data on what the true cost of prisons were. Their reports showed that most states had additional costs ranging from one percent to thirty-four percent outside of what their original budget was for that year.

John W. Whitehead, constitutional attorney and founder of the Rutherford Institute asserts that &quot;Prison privatization simply encourages incarceration for the sake of profits, while causing millions of Americans, most of them minor, nonviolent criminals, to be handed over to corporations for lengthy prison sentences which do nothing to protect society or prevent recidivism.&quot; Whitehead argues that it characterizes an increasingly inverted justice system dependent upon an advancement in power and wealth of the corporate state.

Hadar Aviram, Professor of Law at UC Hastings, suggests that critics of the prison-industrial complex focus too much on private prisons. While Aviram shares their concerns that &quot;private enterprises designed to directly benefit from human confinement and misery is profoundly unethical and problematic,&quot; she contends that &quot;the profit incentives that brought private incarceration into existence, rather than private incarceration itself, are to blame for the PIC and its evils&quot;. In the neoliberal era, she argues, &quot;private and public actors alike respond to market pressures and conduct their business, including correctional business, through a cost/benefit prism&quot;.

==Immigration==
Funding of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is increasing as about a total of $4.27 billion was allotted to the INS in the 2000 fiscal budget. This is 8% more than in the 1999 fiscal budget. This expansion, experts claim, has been too rapid and thus has led to an increased chance on the part of faculty for negligence and abuse. Lucas Guttengag, director of the ACLU Immigrants&#x27; Rights Project stated that, &quot;immigrants awaiting administrative hearings are being detained in conditions that would be unacceptable at prisons for criminal offenders.&quot; Such examples include &quot;travelers without visas&quot; (TWOVs) being held in motels near airports nicknamed &quot;Motel Kafkas&quot; that are under the jurisdiction of private security officers who have no affiliation to the government, often denying them telephones or fresh air, and there are some cases where detainees have been shackled and sexually abused according to Guttengag. Similar conditions arose in the ESMOR detention center at Elizabeth, New Jersey where complaints arose in less than a year, despite having a &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; facility.

The number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. is 11.3 million. Those that argue against the PIC claim that effective immigration policy has failed to pass since private detention centers profit from keeping undocumented immigrants detained. They also claim that despite having the incarceration rate grow &quot;10 times what it was prior to 1970... it has not made this country any safer.&quot; Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, the budget for Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), have nearly doubled from 2003 to 2008, with CBP&#x27;s budget increasing from $5.8 billion to $10.1 billion and ICE from $3.2 billion to $5 billion and even so there has been no significant decrease in immigrant population. Professor Wayne Cornelius, professor Emeritus of Political Science at UC San Diego, even argued that it is so ineffective that &quot;92–97%&quot; of immigrants who attempt to cross in illegally &quot;keep trying until they succeed&quot;, and that such measures actually increase the risk and cost of travel, leading to longer stays and settlement in the US.

There are around 400,000 immigrant detainees per year, and 50% are housed in private facilities. In 2011, CCA&#x27;s net worth was $1.4 billion and net income was $162 million. In this same year, The GEO Group had a net worth of $1.2 billion and net income of $78 million. As of 2012, CCA has over 75,000 inmates within 60 facilities and the GEO Group owns over 114 facilities. Over half of the prison industry&#x27;s yearly revenue comes from immigrant detention centers. For some small communities in the Southwestern United States, these facilities serve as an integral part of the economy. According to Chris Kirkham, this constitutes part of a growing immigration industrial complex: &quot;Companies dependent upon continued growth in the numbers of undocumented immigrants detained have exerted themselves in the nation&#x27;s capital and in small, rural communities to create incentives that reinforce that growth.&quot; A study by the ACLU says that many are housed in inhumane conditions as many facilities operated by private companies are exempt from government oversight, and studies are made difficult as such facilities may not be covered by a Freedom of Information Act.

In 2009, University of Kansas professor Tanya Golash-Boza coined the term, &quot;Immigration Industrial Complex&quot;, defining it as &quot;the confluence of public and private sector interests in the criminalization of undocumented migration, immigration law enforcement, and the promotion of &#x27;anti-illegal&#x27; rhetoric,&quot; in her paper &quot;The Immigration Industrial Complex: Why We Enforce Immigration Policies Destined to Fail&quot;.

In 2009, congressional immigration detention policies requires that ICE maintain 34,000 immigration detention beds daily. This immigration bed quota has steadily increased with each passing year, costing ICE around $159 to detain one individual for one day.

In 2010, immigration detention policies implemented by ICE benefited the two major private prison corporations CCA and GeoGroup, increasing their share of immigrant detention beds by 13%. Compared to data from 2009, the percentage of ICE immigrant detention beds in the United States are owned and operated by private for-profit prison corporations has increased by 49%, with CCA and GeoGroup operating 8 out of 10 of the largest facilities. Although the combined revenues of CCA and GEO Group were about $4 billion in 2017 from private prison contracts, their number one customer was ICE.

== Impact and response ==

=== Women ===
In 1994, the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women was released which stated that &quot;Among many other abuses women prisoners have identified, are pat searches (male guards pat searching and groping women), illegal strip searches (male guards observing strip searches of women), constant lewd comments and gestures, violations of their right to privacy (male guards watching women in showers and toilets), and in some instances, sexual assault and rape.&quot; International human rights standards reinforce this by stating &quot;the rape of a woman in custody is an act of torture.&quot; In addition, some prisons fail to meet women&#x27;s needs with providing basic hygiene and reproductive health products.

In regards to women and the prison-industrial complex, Angela Davis stated that &quot;State-sanctioned punishment is informed by patriarchal structures and ideologies that have tended to produce historical assumptions of female criminality linked to ideas about the violation of social norms defining a &#x27;woman’s place&#x27;. Considering the fact that as many as half of all women are assaulted by their husbands or partners combined with dramatically rising numbers of women sentenced to prison, it may be argued that women in general are subjected to a far greater magnitude of punishment than men.&quot; She also suggested that the &quot;historical and philosophical connections between domestic violence and imprisonment [comprise] two modes of gendered punishment – one located in the private realm, the other in the public realm.&quot;

Davis continues:the sexual abuse of women in prison is one of the most heinous state-sanctioned human rights violations within the United States today. Women prisoners represent one of the most disenfranchised and invisible adult populations in our society. The absolute power and control the state exercises over their lives both stems from and perpetuates the patriarchal and racist structures that, for centuries, have resulted in the social domination of women.According to Davis and Cassandra Shaylor in their research entitled &quot;Race, Gender, and the Prison-Industrial Complex&quot;, most women in prison experience some degree of depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. Very often they are neither diagnosed nor treated, with injurious consequences for their mental health in and out of prison. Many women report that when requesting counseling, they are offered psychotropic medications instead. As technologies of imprisonment become increasingly repressive and practices of isolation become increasingly routine, mentally ill women often are placed in solitary confinement, which can only exacerbate their condition.

Davis further explains why there is such an increase in female incarceration in the book, &quot;Are Prisons Obsolete?&quot;, in which Davis investigates the structures which the current prison system has formed around:

=== Minorities ===
70 percent of the United States prison population is composed of racial minorities. Due to a variety of factors, different ethnic groups have different rates of offending, arrest, prosecution, conviction and incarceration. In terms of percentage of ethnic populations, in descending order, the U.S. incarcerates more Native Americans, African Americans, followed by Hispanics, Whites, and finally Asians. Native Americans are the largest group incarcerated per capita. It is worth noting that Black women are the fastest growing population of incarcerated people. 

=== Response ===
A 2014 report by the American Friends Service Committee, Grassroots Leadership, and the Southern Center for Human Rights claims that recent reductions in the number of people incarcerated has pushed the prison industry into areas previously served by non-profit behavioral health and treatment-oriented agencies, referring to it as the &quot;Treatment Industrial Complex&quot;, which &quot;has the potential to ensnare more individuals, under increased levels of supervision and surveillance, for increasing lengths of time – in some cases, for the rest of a person&#x27;s life.&quot; Sociologist Nancy A. Heitzeg and activist Kay Whitlock claim that contemporary bipartisan reforms being proposed &quot;are predicated on privatization schemes, dominated by the anti-government right and neoliberal interests that more completely merge for-profit medical treatment and other human needs supports with the prison-industrial complex.&quot;

Sociologist Loïc Wacquant of UC Berkeley is also dismissive of the term for sounding too conspiratorial and for overstating its scope and effect. However Bernard Harcourt, Professor of Law at Columbia University, considers the term useful insofar as &quot;it highlights the profitability of prison building and the employment boom associated with prison guard labor. There is no question that the prison expansion served the financial interests of large sectors of the economy.&quot;

Another writer of the era who covered the expanding prison population and attacked &quot;the prison industrial complex&quot; was Christian Parenti, who later disavowed the term before the publication of his book, &quot;Lockdown America&quot; (2000). &quot;How, then, should the left critique the prison buildup?&quot; asked &quot;The Nation&quot; in 1999:

Prisons in the U.S. are becoming the primary response to mental illness among poor people. The institutionalization of mentally ill people, historically, has been used more often against women than against men.

Other scholars, such as Nils Christie and Mechthild Nagel, have proposed alternative terms such as &quot;criminal industrial complex&quot; and &quot;criminal (justice) industrial complex&quot;. Nagel argues the latter in particular &quot;encompasses tentacles of punitive measures of which &quot;prison&quot; is only one—albeit a severe one—of many forms of social control&quot; and has justice in brackets as it &quot;hides the permanent element of repression that is endemic in a system geared to overempower those who exert power and domination.&quot;

== Reform ==

=== Prison abolition movement ===
A response to the prison industrial complex is the prison abolition movement. The goal of prison abolition is to end the prison industrial complex by eliminating prisons. Prison abolitionists aim to do this by changing the socioeconomic conditions of the communities that are affected the most by the prison-industrial complex. Abolitionists propose reallocating funds to social programs such as education, mental healthcare, housing, and non-armed dispute forces. The purpose of abolition is not necessarily to dismantle, but to revise. Angela Davis, a known political activist and co-founder of Critical Resistance describes the purpose of abolition, &quot;All of these things help to create security and safety. It’s about learning that safety, safeguarded by violence, is not really safety.&quot;

==== Alternatives to detention ====
Due to the overcrowding in prisons and detention centers by for-profit corporations, organizations such as Amnesty International, propose using alternatives such as reporting requirements, bonds, or the use of monitoring technologies. The questions often brought up with alternatives include whether they are effective or efficient. A study published by the Vera Institute attempts to answer this question by stating that when alternatives such as monitoring technologies were used, they found that 91% of the individuals appeared at their court date. The Institute recorded that the relative cost of using such alternatives has been estimated at $12 per day a relatively low price in comparison to the reported average cost of incarceration in the U.S., which has been priced at roughly $87.61 per day.

Despite the relative efficiency and effectiveness of alternative to detention, there is still much debate that these alternatives will not change the dynamics of incarceration. This argument lies in the fact that major corporations such as the GEO Group and Corrections Corporations of America will still be profiting by simply re-branding and moving towards rehabilitation services and monitoring technologies. Rather than effectively ending and finding a solution to the PIC, more people will simply find themselves imprisoned by another system. Other opposition to alternatives comes from the public. According to Ezzat Fattah, opposition towards prison alternatives and correctional facilities is due to the public fearing having that having these facilities in their neighborhoods will threaten the security and integrity of their communities and children.

==== Critical Resistance ====

The movement gained momentum in 1997, when a group of prison abolition activists, scholars, and former prisoners collaborated to organize a three-day conference to examine the prison-industrial complex in the U.S. The founders of Critical Resistance include Angela Davis, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, and Rose Braz. The conference, Critical Resistance to the prison-industrial complex, was held in September 1998 at the University of California, Berkeley and was attended by over 3,500 people of diverse academic, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds. Two years after the conference, a political grassroots organization was founded bearing the same name with the mission to challenge and dismantle the prison-industrial complex.

In 2001, the organization adopted a national structure with local chapters in Portland, Los Angeles, Oakland, and New York City to develop campaigns and projects working towards abolishing the prison industrial complex. Currently, the cause has shifted towards supporting efforts towards resisting state repression and developing tools to re-imagine life without the prison industrial complex.

In 2010, at the U.S. Social Forum, committed activists joined together to discuss prison justice and stated that &quot;Because we share a vision of justice and solidarity against confinement, control, and all forms of political repression, the prison industrial complex must be abolished.&quot; Following the forum, the rise of Formerly Incarcerated, Convicted People&#x27;s Movement helped to incorporate abolition into other movements such as Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and the Movement for Black Lives.

=== School-to-prison pipeline reform ===
A competing explanation for the disproportionate arrest and incarceration of people of color and persons with lower socioeconomic status is the school-to-prison pipeline, which generally proposes that practices in public schools (such as zero-tolerance policies, police in schools, and high-stakes testing) are direct causes of students dropping out of school and, subsequently, committing crimes that lead to their being arrested. 68% of state prisoners had not completed high school in 1997, including 70 percent of women state prisoners. Suspension, expulsion, and being held back during middle school years are the largest predictors of arrest for adolescent women. The school-to-prison pipeline disproportionately affects young black men with an overall incarceration risk that is six to eight times higher than young whites. Black male high school dropouts experienced a 60% risk of imprisonment as of 1999. There is a recent trend of authors describing the school-to-prison pipeline as feeding into the prison-industrial complex.

Since the shortcomings of zero-tolerance discipline have grown very clear, there has been a widespread movement to support reform across school districts and states. Growing research that shows suspensions, especially for minor infractions and misbehavior, are a flawed disciplinary response has encouraged many districts to adopt new disciplinary alternatives. In 2015, mayor of New York City Bill de Blasio joined with the Department of Education to address school discipline in a campaign to tweak the old policies. De Blasio also spearheaded a leadership team on school climate and discipline to take recommendations and craft the foundations for more substantive policy. The team released recommendations that work towards reducing the racial disparity in suspension and discussing the underlying root cause of disciplinary infractions through restorative justice.

<text>Edward George Power Biggs (March 29, 1906 – March 10, 1977) was a British-born American concert organist and recording artist.

==Biography==
Biggs was born in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, England; a year later, the family moved to the Isle of Wight. Biggs was trained in London at the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied with G. D. Cunningham. Biggs immigrated to the United States in 1930. In 1932, he was appointed to a post at Christ Church in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he resided for the rest of his life. His position as a organist however did not last long; believing that his concert work conflicted with his job, the rector dismissed him from the position. As one of the boy choristers (Charles Fisk) noted: “I went to choir practice, Mr. Bigs wasn’t there&quot;.

Biggs did much to bring the classical pipe organ back to prominence, and was in the forefront of the mid-20th-century resurgence of interest in the organ music of pre-Romantic composers. On his first concert tour of Europe, in 1954, Biggs performed and recorded works of Johann Sebastian Bach, Sweelinck, Dieterich Buxtehude, and Pachelbel on historic organs associated with those composers. Thereafter, he believed that such music should ideally be performed on instruments representative of that period and that organ music of that epoch should be played by using (as closely as possible) the styles and registrations of that era. Thus, he gave significant impetus to the American revival of organ building in the style of European Baroque instruments, seen especially in the increasing popularity of tracker organs—analogous to Europe&#x27;s &quot;Orgelbewegung&quot;.

Among other instruments, Biggs championed G. Donald Harrison&#x27;s Baroque-style unenclosed, unencased instrument with 24 stops and electric action (produced by Aeolian-Skinner in 1937 and installed in Harvard&#x27;s Busch-Reisinger Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts) and the three-manual Flentrop tracker organ subsequently installed there in 1958. Many of his CBS radio broadcasts and Columbia recordings were made in the museum. Another remarkable instrument used by Biggs was a pedal harpsichord by John Challis; Biggs made recordings of the music of J. S. Bach, Vivaldi, and even went as far afield as Scott Joplin and Tchaikovsky on this instrument.

Biggs&#x27; critics of the time included rival concert organist Virgil Fox, who was known for a more flamboyant and colorful style of performance. Fox decried Biggs&#x27; insistence on historical accuracy, claiming that it was &quot;relegating the organ to a museum piece&quot;. Artistic rivalries aside, many observers agree that Biggs &quot;should be given great credit for his innovative ideas as far as the musical material he recorded, and for making the organs he recorded even more famous.&quot; Despite different approaches, both artists enjoyed hugely successful careers and Biggs rose to the top of his profession. In addition to concerts and recording, Biggs taught at the Longy School of Music in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at various times in his career and edited a large body of organ music.

Biggs was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950. For his contribution to the recording industry, Biggs has a star on California&#x27;s Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6522 Hollywood Boulevard. He was one of the artists honored to celebrate the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s 125th birthday celebrations in December 1967.

==Selected discography==
Biggs recorded extensively for the Columbia Masterworks Records and RCA Victor labels for more than three decades. Between 1942 and 1958, he also hosted a weekly radio program of organ music (carried throughout the United States on the CBS Radio Network) that introduced audiences to the pipe organ and its literature. He was represented by Mercury Music in the 1950s.

<text>Space Twins is an American rock band fronted by Weezer guitarist Brian Bell.

==History==
===Early years===
Space Twins was founded in 1993 by Weezer guitarist Brian Bell and, his then girlfriend, Susan Fox. Initially, the band was a small project in which the two would dress up in Star Trek style outfits with pipe-cleaner antennae, playing silly songs at kids&#x27; birthday parties. The duo even had nicknames for one another: SpaceHelmet and Moonboot.

===The addition of Tim (Timothy Maloof), Glenn and Mike===
In 1996, the project became more serious, and Bell was joined by high school friends, Timothy and Glenn Maloof. Bell also brought Mike Elliot into the fold, and, thus, a new Space Twins line-up was solidified.

The quartet developed a unique sound that blends modern indie rock with progressive and psychedelic elements. In Weezer&#x27;s down-time, the band released two limited-edition 7&quot; singles: &quot;Osaka Aquabus&quot; (1997) and &quot;TV, Music &amp; Candy&quot; (1998). Both of these sold out quickly and are no longer in print.

===&quot;The End of Imagining&quot;===
In May 2003, the Space Twins independently released their debut album, &quot;The End of Imagining&quot;, on their own label &quot;Raga Drop Records&quot;. The album was critically acclaimed, with Rolling Stone critic John D. Luerresen naming the album 7th best of 2003. The album, like the band&#x27;s previous releases, is out of print and remains sought after by many Weezer fans.

The band performed at the 2003 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas.

===Current status===
In May 2005, a message appeared on the band&#x27;s official website:

&quot;Yesterday the Space Twins jammed. It was much fun. We were working on and jamming a bunch of songs of Glenn&#x27;s. It was like we hadn&#x27;t had a break. Anyways, as soon as Brian gets back from the European tour we will be getting together regularly. We have plans of recording and hopefully touring. Everyone is doing well—Glenn, Mike, Brian and myself.&quot;

Bell has since formed another side-project, The Relationship, and, when asked in the 2006 fan interview, at Weezer&#x27;s official website, Bell stated that: &quot;I’m not pursuing Space Twins presently only The Relationship.&quot;

In the same interview, Bell stated a possibility of putting out a &quot;psychedelic children’s record&quot; involving the Space Twins&#x27; recording of &quot;Nico&quot;, &quot;Flowerpot&quot;, &quot;The Clown Song&quot;, and &quot;Birds In The Street&quot; plus writing some new ones with Timothy Maloof.

<doc id="296435" wikidata="Q509598" url="?curid=296435" title="Electrical susceptance">
<text>In electrical engineering, susceptance () is the imaginary part of admittance (), where the real part is conductance (). The reciprocal of admittance is impedance (), where the imaginary part is reactance () and the real part is resistance (). In SI units, susceptance is measured in siemens (S).

==Origin==
The term was coined by C.P. Steinmetz in a 1894 paper.

In some sources Oliver Heaviside is given credit for coining the term, or with introducing the concept under the name &quot;permittance&quot;.
This claim is mistaken according to Steinmetz&#x27;s biographer.
The term &quot;susceptance&quot; does not appear anywhere in Heaviside&#x27;s collected works, and Heaviside used the term &quot;permittance&quot; to mean capacitance, not &quot;susceptance&quot;.

==Formula==
The general equation defining admittance is given by
formula_1

where

The admittance () is the reciprocal of the impedance (), if the impedance is not zero:

formula_2

and

formula_3

where

The susceptance formula_4 is the imaginary part of the admittance formula_5

The magnitude of admittance is given by:

formula_6

And similar formulas transform admittance into impedance, hence susceptance () into reactance ():

formula_7

hence

formula_8

The reactance and susceptance are only reciprocals in the absence of either resistance or conductance (only if either or , either of which implies the other, as long as , or equivalently as long as ).

== Relation to capacitance ==
In electronic and semiconductor devices, transient or frequency-dependent current between terminals contains both conduction and displacement components. Conduction current is related to moving charge carriers (electrons, holes, ions, etc.), while displacement current is caused by time-varying electric field. Carrier transport is affected by electric field and by a number of physical phenomena, such as carrier drift and diffusion, trapping, injection, contact-related effects, and impact ionization. As a result, device admittance is frequency-dependent, and the simple electrostatic formula for capacitance, formula_9 is not applicable.

A more general definition of capacitance, encompassing electrostatic formula, is:

formula_10

where formula_11 is the device admittance, and formula_4 is the susceptance, both evaluated at the angular frequency in question, and formula_13 is that angular frequency. It is common for electrical components to have slightly reduced capacitances at extreme frequencies, due to slight inductance of the internal conductors used to make capacitors (not just the leads), and permittivity changes in insulating materials with frequency: is &quot;very nearly&quot;, but &quot;not quite&quot; a constant.

==Relationship to reactance==
Reactance is defined as the imaginary part of electrical impedance, and is &quot;analogous&quot; to but not generally equal to the negative reciprocal of the susceptance – that is their reciprocals are equal and opposite only in the special case where the real parts vanish (either zero resistance or zero conductance). In the special case of entirely zero admittance or exactly zero impedance, the relations are encumbered by infinities.

However, for purely-reactive impedances (which are purely-susceptive admittances), the susceptance is equal to the negative reciprocal of the reactance, except when either is zero.

In mathematical notation:

:formula_14

The minus sign is not present in the relationship between electrical resistance and the analogue of conductance formula_15 but otherwise a similar relation holds for the special case of reactance-free impedance (or susceptance-free admittance):
:formula_16

If the imaginary unit is included, we get

:formula_17

for the resistance-free case since,

:formula_18

==Applications==
High susceptance materials are used in susceptors built into microwavable food packaging for their ability to convert microwave radiation into heat.

<doc id="296438" wikidata="Q1779692" url="?curid=296438" title="Voting machine">
<text>A voting machine is a machine used to record votes in an election without paper. The first voting machines were mechanical but it is increasingly more common to use &quot;electronic voting machines&quot;. Traditionally, a voting machine has been defined by its mechanism, and whether the system tallies votes at each voting location, or centrally. Voting machines should not be confused with tabulating machines, which count votes done by paper ballot.

Voting machines differ in usability, security, cost, speed, accuracy, and ability of the public to oversee elections. Machines may be more or less accessible to voters with different disabilities.

Tallies are simplest in parliamentary systems where just one choice is on the ballot, and these are often tallied manually. In other political systems where many choices are on the same ballot, tallies are often done by machines to give faster results.

==Historical machines==
In ancient Athens (5th and 4th centuries BCE) voting was done by different colored pebbles deposited in urns, and later by bronze markers created by the state and officially stamped. This procedure served for elected positions, jury procedures, and ostracisms. The first use of paper ballots was in Rome in 139 BCE, and their first use in the United States was in 1629 to select a pastor for the Salem Church.

===Mechanical voting===
====Balls====
The first major proposal for the use of voting machines came from the Chartists in the United Kingdom in 1838. Among the radical reforms called for in &quot;The People&#x27;s Charter&quot; were universal suffrage and voting by secret ballot. This required major changes in the conduct of elections, and as responsible reformers, the Chartists not only demanded reforms but described how to accomplish them, publishing &quot;Schedule A&quot;, a description of how to run a polling place, and &quot;Schedule B&quot;, a description of a voting machine to be used in such a polling place.

The Chartist voting machine, attributed to Benjamin Jolly of 19 York Street in Bath, allowed each voter to cast one vote in a single race. This matched the requirements of a British parliamentary election. Each voter was to cast his vote by dropping a brass ball into the appropriate hole in the top of the machine by the candidate&#x27;s name. Each voter could only vote once because each voter was given just one brass ball. The ball advanced a clockwork counter for the corresponding candidate as it passed through the machine, and then fell out the front where it could be given to the next voter.

====Buttons====
In 1875, Henry Spratt of Kent received a U.S. patent for a voting machine that presented the ballot as an array of push buttons, one per candidate. Spratt&#x27;s machine was designed for a typical British election with a single plurality race on the ballot.

In 1881, Anthony Beranek of Chicago patented the first voting machine appropriate for use in a general election in the United States. Beranek&#x27;s machine presented an array of push buttons to the voter, with one row per office on the ballot, and one column per party. Interlocks behind each row prevented voting for more than one candidate per race, and an interlock with the door of the voting booth reset the machine for the next voter as each voter left the booth.

====Tokens====
The psephograph was patented by Italian inventor Eugenio Boggiano in 1907. It worked by dropping a metal token into one of several labeled slots. The psephograph would automatically tally the total tokens deposited in each slot. The psephograph was first used in a theatre in Rome, where it was used to gauge audience reception to a play: &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, or &quot;indifferent&quot;.

====Analog computers====
Lenna Winslow&#x27;s 1910 voting machine was designed to offer all the questions on the ballot to men and only some to women because women often had partial suffrage, e.g. being allowed to vote on issues but not candidates. The machine had two doors, one marked &quot;Gents&quot; and the other marked &quot;Ladies&quot;. The door used to enter the voting booth would activate a series of levers and switches to display the full ballot for men and the partial ballot for women.

====Dials====
By July 1936, IBM had mechanized voting and ballot tabulation for single transferable vote elections. Using a series of dials, the voter could record up to twenty ranked preferences to a punched card, one preference at a time. Write-in votes were permitted. The machine prevented a voter from spoiling their ballot by skipping rankings and by giving the same ranking to more than one candidate. A standard punched-card counting machine would tabulate ballots at a rate of 400 per minute.

====Levers====
Lever machines were commonly used in the United States until the 1990s. In 1889, Jacob H. Myers of Rochester, New York, received a patent for a voting machine that was based on Beranek&#x27;s 1881 push button machine. This machine saw its first use in Lockport, New York, in 1892. In 1894, Sylvanus Davis added a straight-party lever and significantly simplified the interlocking mechanism used to enforce the vote-for-one rule in each race. By 1899, Alfred Gillespie introduced several refinements. It was Gillespie who replaced the heavy metal voting booth with a curtain that was linked to the cast-vote lever, and Gillespie introduced the lever by each candidate name that was turned to point to that name in order to cast a vote for that candidate. Inside the machine, Gillespie worked out how to make the machine programmable so that it could support races in which voters were allowed to vote for, for example, 3 out of 5 candidates.

On December 14, 1900, the U.S. Standard Voting Machine Company was formed, with Alfred Gillespie as one of its directors, to combine the companies that held the Myers, Davis, and Gillespie patents. By the 1920s, this company (under various names) had a monopoly on voting machines, until, in 1936, Samuel and Ransom Shoup obtained a patent for a competing voting machine. By 1934, about a sixth of all presidential ballots were being cast on mechanical voting machines, essentially all made by the same manufacturer.

Commonly, a voter enters the machine and pulls a lever to close the curtain, thus unlocking the voting levers. The voter then makes his or her selection from an array of small voting levers denoting the appropriate candidates or measures. The machine is configured to prevent overvotes by locking out other candidates when one candidate&#x27;s lever is turned down. When the voter is finished, a lever is pulled which opens the curtain and increments the appropriate counters for each candidate and measure. At the close of the election, the results are hand copied by the precinct officer, although some machines could automatically print the totals. New York was the last state to stop using these machines, under court order, by the fall of 2009.

===Punched card voting===

Punched card systems employ a card (or cards) and a small clipboard-sized device for recording votes. Voters punch holes in the cards with a ballot marking device. Typical ballot marking devices carry a ballot label that identifies the candidates or issues associated with each punching position on the card, although in some cases, the names and issues are printed directly on the card. After voting, the voter may place the ballot in a ballot box, or the ballot may be fed into a computer vote tabulating device at the precinct.

The idea of voting by punching holes on paper or cards originated in the 1890s and inventors continued to explore this in the years that followed.
By the late 1890s John McTammany&#x27;s voting machine was used widely in several states. In this machine, votes were recorded by punching holes in a roll of paper comparable to those used in player pianos, and then tabulated after the polls closed using a pneumatic mechanism.

Punched-card voting was proposed occasionally in the mid-20th century, but the first major success for punched-card voting came in 1965, with Joseph P. Harris&#x27; development of the Votomatic punched-card system. This was based on IBM&#x27;s Port-A-Punch technology. Harris licensed the Votomatic to IBM. William Rouverol built the prototype system.

The Votomatic system was very successful and widely distributed. By the 1996 Presidential election, some variation of the punched card system was used by 37.3% of registered voters in the United States.

Votomatic style systems and punched cards received considerable notoriety in 2000 when their uneven use in Florida was alleged to have affected the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 &quot;effectively banned pre-scored punched card ballots.&quot; Votomatics were &quot;last used in 2 counties in Idaho in the 2014 General Election&quot;.

==Current voting machines==
An electronic voting machine is a voting machine based on electronics.

Two main technologies exist: &quot;optical scanning&quot; and &quot;direct recording&quot; (DRE).

===Optical scanning===


In an optical scan voting system, or marksense, each voter&#x27;s choices are marked on one or more pieces of paper, which then go through a scanner. The scanner creates an electronic image of each ballot, interprets it, creates a tally for each candidate, and usually stores the image for later review.

The voter may mark the paper directly, usually in a specific location for each candidate. Or the voter may select choices on an electronic screen, which then prints the chosen names, and a bar code or QR code summarizing all choices, on a sheet of paper to put in the scanner.

Hundreds of errors in optical scan systems have been found, from feeding ballots upside down, multiple ballots pulled through at once in central counts, paper jams, broken, blocked or overheated sensors which misinterpret some or many ballots, printing which does not align with the programming, programming errors, and loss of files.

===Direct-recording electronic (DRE)===


In a DRE voting machine system, a touch screen displays choices to the voter, who selects choices, and can change their mind as often as needed, before casting the vote. Staff initialize each voter once on the machine, to avoid repeat voting. Voting data are recorded in memory components, and can be copied out at the end of the election.

Most of these machines also print names of chosen candidates on paper for the voter to verify, though some studies have indicated that fewer than 40% of voters do so. The paper ballot, whether paper tape or separate ballot sheets, the paper ballot is securely stored, creating a voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) that can be used for election audits and recounts if needed.

For machines without VVPAT, there is no record of individual votes to check. For machines with VVPAT, checking is more expensive than with paper ballots, because on the flimsy thermal paper in a long continuous roll, staff often lose their place, and the printout has each change by each voter, not just their final decisions.

Problems have included public web access to the software, before it is loaded into machines for each election, and programming errors which increment different candidates than voters select. The Federal Constitutional Court of Germany found that with existing machines could not be allowed because they could not be monitored by the public.

According to University of Iowa computer scientist Douglas Jones, a specialist in the use of computers in elections, there has been no evidence of hackers accessing electronic voting machines in public use, though some hacks have been achieved in controlled laboratory settings.

==Location of tallying==

Optical scans can be done either at the polling place or in another location. DRE machines always tally at the precinct.

===Precinct-count voting system===
A precinct-count voting system is a voting system that tallies ballots at the polling place. Precinct-count machines typically analyze ballots as they are cast. This approach allows for voters to be notified of voting errors such as overvotes and can prevent spoilt votes. After the voter has a chance to correct any errors, the precinct-count machine tallies that ballot. Vote totals are made public only after the close of polling. DREs and precinct scanners have electronic storage of the vote tallies and may transmit results to a central location over public telecommunication networks.

=== Central-count voting system ===

A central count voting system is a voting system that tallies ballots from multiple precincts at a central location. Central count systems are also commonly used to process absentee ballots.

Central counting can be done by hand, and in some jurisdictions, central counting is done using the same type of voting machine deployed at polling places, but since the introduction of the Votomatic punched-card voting system and the Norden Electronic Vote Tallying System in the 1960s, high speed ballot tabulators have been in widespread use, particularly in large metropolitan jurisdictions. Today, commodity high-speed scanners sometimes serve this purpose, but special-purpose ballot scanners are also available that incorporate sorting mechanisms to separate tallied ballots from those requiring human interpretation.

Voted ballots are typically placed into secure ballot boxes at the polling place. Stored ballots and/or Precinct Counts are transported or transmitted to a central counting location. The system produces a printed report of the vote count, and may produce a report stored on electronic media suitable for broadcasting, or release on the Internet.

<text>The impala or rooibok (Aepyceros melampus, lit. &#x27;black-footed high-horn&#x27; in Ancient Greek) is a medium-sized antelope found in eastern and southern Africa. The only extant member of the genus &quot;Aepyceros&quot;, and tribe Aepycerotini, it was first described to Europeans by German zoologist Hinrich Lichtenstein in 1812. Two subspecies are recognised—the grassland-dwelling common impala (sometimes referred to as the Kenyan impala), and the larger and darker black-faced impala, which lives in slightly more arid, scrubland environments. The impala reaches at the shoulder and weighs . It features a glossy, reddish brown coat. The male&#x27;s slender, lyre-shaped horns are long.

Active mainly during the day, the impala may be gregarious or territorial depending upon the climate and geography. Three distinct social groups can be observed: the territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds. The impala is known for two characteristic leaps that constitute an anti-predator strategy. Browsers as well as grazers, impala feed on monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). An annual, three-week-long rut takes place toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Rutting males fight over dominance, and the victorious male courts females in oestrus. Gestation lasts six to seven months, following which a single calf is born and immediately concealed in cover. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males—forced out of the all-female groups—join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.

The impala is found in woodlands and sometimes on the interface (ecotone) between woodlands and savannahs; it inhabits places near water. While the black-faced impala is confined to southwestern Angola and Kaokoland in northwestern Namibia, the common impala is widespread across its range and has been reintroduced in Gabon and southern Africa. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the impala as a species of least concern; the black-faced subspecies has been classified as a vulnerable species, with fewer than 1,000 individuals remaining in the wild as of 2008.

==Etymology==
The first attested English name, in 1802, was palla or pallah, from the Tswana &#x27; &#x27;red antelope&#x27;; the name &quot;impala&quot;, also spelled &quot;impalla&quot; or &quot;mpala&quot;, is first attested in 1875, and is directly from Zulu. Its Afrikaans name, &#x27; &#x27;red buck&#x27;, is also sometimes used in English.

The scientific generic name &quot;Aepyceros&quot; ( ‘high-horned’) comes from Ancient Greek (&#x27;, &#x27;high, steep&#x27;) + (&#x27;, &#x27;horn&#x27;); the specific name &quot;melampus&quot; ( ‘black-foot’) from (&#x27;, &#x27;black&#x27;) + (&#x27;, &#x27;foot&#x27;).

==Taxonomy and evolution==

The impala is the sole member of the genus &quot;Aepyceros&quot; and belongs to the family Bovidae. It was first described by German zoologist Martin Hinrich Carl Lichtenstein in 1812. In 1984, palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba opined that the impala is a sister taxon to the alcelaphines, given its resemblance to the hartebeest. A 1999 phylogenetic study by Alexandre Hassanin (of the National Centre for Scientific Research, Paris) and colleagues, based on mitochondrial and nuclear analyses, showed that the impala forms a clade with the suni (&quot;Neotragus moschatus&quot;). This clade is sister to another formed by the bay duiker (&quot;Cephalophus dorsalis&quot;) and the klipspringer (&quot;Oreotragus oreotragus&quot;). An rRNA and β-spectrin nuclear sequence analysis in 2003 also supported an association between &quot;Aepyceros&quot; and &quot;Neotragus&quot;. The following cladogram is based on the 1999 study:

Up to six subspecies have been described, although only two are generally recognised on the basis of mitochondrial data. Though morphologically similar, the subspecies show a significant genetic distance between them, and no hybrids between them have been reported.
* &quot;A. m. melampus&quot; : Known as the common impala, it occurs across eastern and southern Africa. The range extends from central Kenya to South Africa and westward into southeastern Angola.
* &quot;A. m. petersi&quot; : Known as the black-faced impala, it is restricted to southwestern Africa, occurring in northwestern Namibia and southwestern Angola.

According to Vrba, the impala evolved from an alcelaphine ancestor. She noted that while this ancestor has diverged at least 18 times into various morphologically different forms, the impala has continued in its basic form for at least five million years. Several fossil species have been discovered, including &quot;A. datoadeni&quot; from the Pliocene of Ethiopia. The oldest fossil discovered suggests its ancient ancestors were slightly smaller than the modern form, but otherwise very similar in all aspects to the latter. This implies that the impala has efficiently adapted to its environment since prehistoric times. Its gregarious nature, variety in diet, positive population trend, defence against ticks and symbiotic relationship with the tick-feeding oxpeckers could have played a role in preventing major changes in morphology and behaviour.

==Description==
The impala is a medium-sized, slender-bodied antelope, comparable to the kob, puku and Grant&#x27;s gazelle in size and build. The head-and-body length is around . Males reach approximately at the shoulder, while females are tall. Males typically weigh and females . Sexually dimorphic, females are hornless and smaller than males. Males grow slender, lyre-shaped horns long. The horns, strongly ridged and divergent, are circular in section and hollow at the base. Their arch-like structure allows interlocking of horns, which helps a male throw off his opponent during fights; horns also protect the skull from damage.

The glossy coat of the impala shows two-tone colourationthe reddish brown back and the tan flanks; these are in sharp contrast to the white underbelly. Facial features include white rings around the eyes and a light chin and snout. The ears, long, are tipped with black. Black streaks run from the buttocks to the upper hindlegs. The bushy white tail, long, features a solid black stripe along the midline. The impala&#x27;s colouration bears a strong resemblance to the gerenuk, which has shorter horns and lacks the black thigh stripes of the impala. The impala has scent glands covered by a black tuft of hair on the hindlegs. 2-Methylbutanoic Acid and 2-Nonanone have been identified from this gland. Sebaceous glands concentrated on the forehead and dispersed on the torso of dominant males are most active during the mating season, while those of females are only partially developed and do not undergo seasonal changes. There are four nipples.

Of the subspecies, the black-faced impala is significantly larger and darker than the common impala; melanism is responsible for the black colouration. Distinctive of the black-faced impala is a dark stripe, on either side of the nose, that runs upward to the eyes and thins as it reaches the forehead. Other differences include the larger black tip on the ear, and a bushier and nearly 30% longer tail in the black-faced impala.

The impala has a special dental arrangement on the front lower jaw similar to the toothcomb seen in strepsirrhine primates, which is used during allogrooming to comb the fur on the head and the neck and remove ectoparasites.

==Ecology and behaviour==
The impala is diurnal (active mainly during the day), though activity tends to cease during the hot midday hours; they feed and rest at night. Three distinct social groups can be observedthe territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds. The territorial males hold territories where they may form harems of females; territories are demarcated with urine and faeces and defended against juvenile or male intruders. Bachelor herds tend to be small, with less than 30 members. Individuals maintain distances of from one another; while young and old males may interact, middle-aged males generally avoid one another except to spar. Female herds vary in size from 6 to 100; herds occupy home ranges of . The mother–calf bond is weak, and breaks soon after weaning; juveniles leave the herds of their mothers to join other herds. Female herds tend to be loose and have no obvious leadership. Allogrooming is an important means of social interaction in bachelor and female herds; in fact, the impala appears to be the only ungulate to display self-grooming as well as allogrooming. In allogrooming, females typically groom related impalas, while males associate with unrelated ones. Each partner grooms the other six to twelve times.

Social behaviour is influenced by the climate and geography; as such, the impala are territorial at certain times of the year and gregarious at other times, and the length of these periods can vary broadly among populations. For instance, populations in southern Africa display territorial behaviour only during the few months of the rut, whereas in eastern African populations, territoriality is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season. Moreover, territorial males often tolerate bachelors, and may even alternate between bachelorhood and territoriality at different times of the year. A study of impala in the Serengeti National Park showed that in 94% of the males, territoriality was observed for less than four months.

The impala is an important prey species for Africa&#x27;s large carnivores, such as cheetahs, leopards, wild dogs (its main predator), lions, hyenas, crocodiles and pythons. The antelope displays two characteristic leapsit can jump up to , over vegetation and even other impala, covering distances of up to ; the other type of leap involves a series of jumps in which the animal lands on its forelegs, moves its hindlegs mid-air in a kicking fashion, lands on all fours (stotting) and then rebounds. It leaps in either manner in different directions, probably to confuse predators. At times, the impala may also conceal itself in vegetation to escape the eye of the predator. The most prominent vocalisation is the loud roar, delivered through one to three loud snorts with the mouth closed, followed by two to ten deep grunts with the mouth open and the chin and tail raised; a typical roar can be heard up to away. Scent gland secretions identify a territorial male. Impalas are sedentary; adult and middle-aged males, in particular, can hold their territories for years.

===Parasites===
Common ixodid ticks collected from impala include &quot;Amblyomma hebraeum&quot;, &quot;Boophilus decoloratus&quot;, &quot;Hyalomma marginatum&quot;, &quot;Ixodes cavipalpus&quot;, &quot;Rhipicephalus appendiculatus&quot; and &quot;R. evertsi&quot;. In Zimbabwe, heavy infestation by ticks such as &quot;R. appendiculatus&quot; has proved to be a major cause behind the high mortality of ungulates, as they can lead to tick paralysis. Impala have special adaptations for grooming, such as their characteristic dental arrangement, to manage ticks before they engorge; however, the extensive grooming needed to keep the tick load under control involves the risk of dehydration during summer, lower vigilance against predators and gradual wearing out of the teeth. A study showed that impala adjust the time devoted to grooming and the number of grooming bouts according to the seasonal prevalence of ticks.

Impala are symbiotically related to oxpeckers, which feed on ticks from those parts of the antelope&#x27;s body which the animal cannot access by itself (such as the ears, neck, eyelids, forehead and underbelly). The impala is the smallest ungulate with which oxpeckers are associated. In a study it was observed that oxpeckers selectively attended to impala despite the presence of other animals such as Coke&#x27;s hartebeest, Grant&#x27;s gazelle, Thomson&#x27;s gazelle and topi. A possible explanation for this could be that because the impala inhabits woodlands (which can have a high density of ticks), the impala could have greater mass of ticks per unit area of the body surface. Another study showed that the oxpeckers prefer the ears over other parts of the body, probably because these parts show maximum tick infestation. The bird has also been observed to perch on the udders of a female and pilfer its milk. 

Lice recorded from impala include &quot;Damalinia aepycerus&quot;, &quot;D. elongata&quot;, &quot;Linognathus aepycerus&quot; and &quot;L. nevilli&quot;; in a study, ivermectin (a medication against parasites) was found to have an effect on &quot;Boophilus decoloratus&quot; and &quot;Linognathus&quot; species, though not on &quot;Damalinia&quot; species. In a study of impala in South Africa, the number of worms in juveniles showed an increase with age, reaching a peak when impala turned a year old. This study recorded worms of genera such as &quot;Cooperia&quot;, &quot;Cooperoides&quot;, &quot;Fasciola&quot;, &quot;Gongylonema&quot;. &quot;Haemonchus&quot;, &quot;Impalaia&quot;, &quot;Longistrongylus&quot; and &quot;Trichostrongylus&quot;; some of these showed seasonal variations in density.

Impala show high frequency of defensive behaviours towards flying insects. This is probably the reason for Vale 1977 and Clausen et al 1998 only finding trace levels of feeding by &quot;Glossina&quot; (tsetse fly) upon impala.

&quot;Theileria&quot; of impala in Kenya are not cross infectious to cattle: Grootenhuis et al 1975 were not able to induce cattle infection and Fawcett et al 1987 did not find it naturally occurring.

===Diet===
Impala browse as well as graze; either may predominate, depending upon the availability of resources. The diet comprises monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and &quot;acacia&quot; pods (whenever available). Impala prefer places close to water sources, and resort to succulent vegetation if water is scarce. An analysis showed that the diet of impala is composed of 45% monocots, 45% dicots and 10% fruits; the proportion of grasses in the diet increases significantly (to as high as 90%) after the first rains, but declines in the dry season. Browsing predominates in the late wet and dry season, and diets are nutritionally poor in the mid-dry season, when impala feed mostly on woody dicots. Another study showed that the dicot proportion in the diet is much higher in bachelors and females than in territorial males.

Impala feed on soft and nutritious grasses such as &quot;Digitaria macroblephara&quot;; tough, tall grasses, such as &quot;Heteropogon contortus&quot; and &quot;Themeda triandra&quot;, are typically avoided. Impala on the periphery of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% of the day in the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).

===Reproduction===

Males are sexually mature by the time they are a year old, though successful mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females. Females can conceive after they are a year and a half old; oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Gonadal growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The bulbourethral glands are heavier, testosterone levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons.

Rutting males fight over dominance, often giving out noisy roars and chasing one another; they walk stiffly and display their neck and horns. Males desist from feeding and allogrooming during the rut, probably to devote more time to garnering females in oestrus; the male checks the female&#x27;s urine to ensure that she is in oestrus. On coming across such a female, the excited male begins the courtship by pursuing her, keeping a distance of from her. The male flicks his tongue and may nod vigorously; the female allows him to lick her vulva, and holds her tail to one side. The male tries mounting the female, holding his head high and clasping her sides with his forelegs. Mounting attempts may be repeated every few seconds to every minute or two. The male loses interest in the female after the first copulation, though she is still active and can mate with other males.

Gestation lasts six to seven months. Births generally occur in the midday; the female will isolate herself from the herd when labour pain begins. The perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic. A single calf is born, and is immediately concealed in cover for the first few weeks of its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother&#x27;s herd. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males, forced out of the group, join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.

==Distribution and habitat==

The impala inhabits woodlands due to its preference for shade; it can also be found on the interface (ecotone) between woodlands and savannahs. Places near water sources are preferred. In southern Africa, populations tend to be associated with &quot;Colophospermum mopane&quot; and &quot;Acacia&quot; woodlands. Habitat choices differ seasonally&quot;Acacia senegal&quot; woodlands are preferred in the wet season, and &quot;A. drepanolobium&quot; savannahs in the dry season. Another factor that could influence habitat choice is vulnerability to predators; impala tend to keep away from areas with tall grasses as predators could be concealed there. A study found that the reduction of woodland cover and creation of shrublands by the African bush elephants has favoured impala population by increasing the availability of more dry season browse. Earlier, the &quot;Baikiaea&quot; woodland, which has now declined due to elephants, provided minimum browsing for impala. The newly formed &quot;Capparis&quot; shrubland, on the other hand, could be a key browsing habitat. Impala are generally not associated with montane habitats; however, in KwaZulu-Natal, impala have been recorded at altitudes of up to above sea level.

The historical range of the impala – spanning across southern and eastern Africa – has remained intact to a great extent, although it has disappeared from a few places, such as Burundi. The range extends from central and southern Kenya and northeastern Uganda in the east to northern KwaZulu-Natal in the south, and westward up to Namibia and southern Angola. The black-faced impala is confined to southwestern Angola and Kaokoland in northwestern Namibia; the status of this subspecies has not been monitored since the 2000s. The common impala has a wider distribution, and has been introduced in protected areas in Gabon and across southern Africa.

==Threats and conservation==
The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the impala as a species of least concern overall. The black-faced impala, however, is classified as a vulnerable species; as of 2008, fewer than 1,000 were estimated in the wild. Though there are no major threats to the survival of the common impala, poaching and natural calamities have significantly contributed to the decline of the black-faced impala. As of 2008, the population of the common impala has been estimated at around two million. According to some studies, translocation of the black-faced impala can be highly beneficial in its conservation.

Around a quarter of the common impala populations occur in protected areas, such as the Okavango Delta (Botswana); Masai Mara and Kajiado (Kenya); Kruger National Park (South Africa); the Ruaha and Serengeti National Parks and Selous Game Reserve (Tanzania); Luangwa Valley (Zambia); Hwange, Sebungwe and Zambezi Valley (Zimbabwe). The rare black-faced impala has been introduced into private farms in Namibia and the Etosha National Park. Population densities vary largely from place to place; from less than one impala per square kilometre in Mkomazi National Park (Tanzania) to as high as 135 per square kilometre near Lake Kariba (Zimbabwe).

<doc id="296454" wikidata="Q420421" url="?curid=296454" title="Acolyte">
<text>An acolyte is an assistant or follower assisting the celebrant in a religious service or procession. In many Christian denominations, an acolyte is anyone performing ceremonial duties such as lighting altar candles. In others, the term is used for one who has been inducted into a particular liturgical ministry, even when not performing those duties.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;&quot; is derived from the Greek word ἀκόλουθος (&quot;akolouthos&quot;), meaning an attendant, via Late Latin &quot;acolythus&quot;.

==Eastern Christianity==


In the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches, the nearest equivalent of acolyte is the altar server. At one time there was a rank of minor clergy called the &quot;taper-bearer&quot; (κηροφόρος) responsible for bearing lights during processions and liturgical entrances. However, this rank has long ago been subsumed by that of the reader and the service for the tonsure of a reader begins with the setting-aside of a taper-bearer.

The functions of an acolyte or taper-bearer are therefore carried out by readers, subdeacons, or by non-tonsured men or boys who are sometimes called &quot;acolytes&quot; informally. Also, the term &quot;altar-boys&quot; is often used to refer to young altar servers. Subdeacons wear their normal vestments consisting of the sticharion and crossed orarion; readers and servers traditionally wear the sticharion alone.

In recent times, however, in many of the North American Greek Orthodox Churches, for the sake of uniformity, readers have been permitted to wear the orarion (the bishop presents the reader, who is to serve on the altar, with the orarion). Readers do not cross the orarion while wearing it, the uncrossed orarion being intended to slightly distinguish a reader from a subdeacon.

In the Russian tradition, readers wear only the sticharion, and do not wear the orarion unless they have been specially blessed to by their bishop. (This might be done if a reader must occasionally serve in the role of a subdeacon, or for some other reason the bishop believes is fitting.) If a server has not been tonsured, he must remove the sticharion before he can receive Holy Communion.

==Western Christianity==
===Catholic Church===

Until 1972, the highest of the four minor orders in the Latin Church was that of acolyte. By his &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Ministeria quaedam&quot; of 15 August 1972, Pope Paul VI replaced the term &quot;minor orders&quot; by that of &quot;ministries&quot; and the term &quot;ordination&quot; by &quot;institution&quot;. He kept throughout the Latin Church two now-titled instituted ministries, those of reader and acolyte. A prescribed interval, as decided by the Holy See and the national episcopal conference, is to be observed between receiving the two. Candidates for diaconate and for priesthood must receive both ministries and exercise them for some time before receiving holy orders. The two instituted ministries are not reserved solely for candidates for holy orders. Ministries are conferred by the ordinary: either a bishop or the head of a similar territory or, in the case of clerical religious institutes, a major superior. Institutions of acolytes not preparing for holy orders are in fact sometimes carried out.

The &quot;motu proprio&quot; assigned to the instituted acolyte the functions previously reserved for the subdeacon, and declared national episcopal conferences free to use the term &quot;subdeacon&quot; in place of that of &quot;acolyte&quot;. The functions of the instituted acolyte are specified in the &quot;motu proprio&quot;, and have been indicated also in the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, no. 98, which under the heading, &quot;The Ministry of the Instituted Acolyte and Lector&quot;, says: &quot;The acolyte is instituted to serve at the altar and to assist the priest and deacon. In particular, it is his responsibility to prepare the altar and the sacred vessels and, if it is necessary, as an extraordinary minister, to distribute the Eucharist to the faithful. In the ministry of the altar, the acolyte has his own functions (cf. nos. 187-193), which he must perform personally.&quot;

The General Instruction of the Roman Missal adds: &quot;In the absence of an instituted acolyte, lay ministers may be deputed to serve at the altar and assist the priest and the deacon; they may carry the cross, the candles, the thurible, the bread, the wine, and the water, and they may also be deputed to distribute Holy Communion as extraordinary ministers.&quot; However, some functions, in particular that of cleansing the Eucharistic vessels, are reserved for an instituted acolyte and are not entrusted to those deputed to assist in that way.

As in other churches, in the Latin Church the term &quot;acolyte&quot; is also used of altar servers on whom no ordination or institution has been conferred. Pope Benedict XVI spoke of Saint Tarcisius as &quot;presumably an acolyte, that is, an altar server&quot;.

Pope Francis changed canon law in January 2021 to allow female installed acolytes. Prior to his &quot;motu proprio Spiritus Domini&quot; only men could be installed acolytes.

While the approved English translations of the liturgical books of the Catholic Church&#x27;s Roman Rite use the term &quot;instituted&quot; (such as &quot;instituted acolytes&quot; and &quot;instituted lectors&quot;) some translations refer to them as &quot;installed&quot;. For example, the translation on the Vatican&#x27;s website of the 2019 Motu Proprio Aperuit illis – Instituting the Sunday of the Word of God has &quot;Bishops could celebrate the Rite of Installation of Lectors or a similar commissioning of readers …&quot;.

===Lutheran Churches===

In the Lutheran Churches, acolytes have various responsibilities, such as ringing the church bells and lighting the candles in the chancel. The various acolytes in the Lutheran Churches have different roles:
*Crucifer
*Thurifer
*Torchbearer
*Biblebearer
*Bannerbearer

Certain acolytes are assigned the role of crucifer or thurifer, who carry the processional cross and thurible respectively. The torchbearer stands to the side of the crucifer to carry candles, during the procession and recession. The bannerbearer typically carries a gonfalon in processions and recessions. The Bible bearer is tasked with placing &quot;the Bible on the altar or missal stand until the Gospel procession.&quot;

Acolytes typically wear albs and the cincture used may reflect the colour of the liturgical season in the Christian kalendar.

The role of the acolyte is considered important in Lutheranism as those who serve in these roles, typically youth, often develop an interest in holy orders.

===Anglican Churches===

The order of acolyte was not initially retained with Anglicanism during the English Reformation therefore there is no definition of their role in the Book of Common Prayer 1662. The use of acolytes (like many Anglican practices) is very much dependent on local practice, some parishes may refer to altar servers as &quot;acolytes,&quot; whereas other parishes may have them as a distinctive and formal ministry. Then in Low or Evangelical Parishes the use of Acolytes or altar servers may not exist at all. Where acolytes are used, opinions on gender and age vary.

An acolyte can assist in worship by carrying a processional cross, lighting candles, holding the Gospel book, holding candles or &quot;torches&quot;, assisting a deacon or priest prepare and clean the altar, swinging a censer or thurible (also being named the thurifer) or carrying the incense boat, handing the offering plates to ushers, and many other tasks as seen fit by the priest or acolyte warden.

===Methodist Churches===
In the Methodist tradition, acolytes may participate in the worship service by carrying a processional cross or crucifix (these acolytes are called crucifers), lighting and extinguishing the altar candles, and ringing the church bell to call the congregation to worship. In these traditions, the lighting of the altar candles in the worship service is a symbol of Jesus&#x27; coming into the presence of the worshiping community. Before lighting the candles the acolyte may bow at the altar out of respect. Before the extinguishing of the last altar candles, the acolytes relight their &quot;candle lighter&quot; and then process out into the narthex. This symbolizes that Jesus Christ is for all people everywhere. It also symbolizes the light of Jesus Christ going out into the world where believers are called to serve. Acolytes in these traditions wear robes called albs, sometimes with a cincture; alternatively Methodist acolytes in other congregations wear the traditional cassock and cotta.

<doc id="296457" wikidata="Q203973" url="?curid=296457" title="Conjoint analysis">
<text>Conjoint analysis is a survey-based statistical technique used in market research that helps determine how people value different attributes (feature, function, benefits) that make up an individual product or service.

The objective of conjoint analysis is to determine the influence of a set of attributes on respondent choice or decision making. In a conjoint experiment, a controlled set of potential products or services, broken down by attribute, is shown to survey respondents. By analyzing how respondents choose among the products, the respondents&#x27; valuation of the attributes making up the products or services can be determined. These implicit valuations (utilities or part-worths) can be used to create market models that estimate market share, revenue and even profitability of new designs.

Conjoint analysis originated in mathematical psychology and was developed by marketing professor Paul E. Green at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Other prominent conjoint analysis pioneers include professor V. &quot;Seenu&quot; Srinivasan of Stanford University who developed a linear programming (LINMAP) procedure for rank ordered data as well as a self-explicated approach, and Jordan Louviere (University of Iowa) who invented and developed choice-based approaches to conjoint analysis and related techniques such as best–worst scaling.

Today it is used in many of the social sciences and applied sciences including marketing, product management, and operations research. It is used frequently in testing customer acceptance of new product designs, in assessing the appeal of advertisements and in service design. It has been used in product positioning, but there are some who raise problems with this application of conjoint analysis.

Conjoint analysis techniques may also be referred to as multiattribute compositional modelling, discrete choice modelling, or stated preference research, and are part of a broader set of trade-off analysis tools used for systematic analysis of decisions. These tools include Brand-Price Trade-Off, Simalto, and mathematical approaches such as AHP, PAPRIKA, evolutionary algorithms or rule-developing experimentation.

== Conjoint design ==
A product or service area is described in terms of a number of attributes. For example, a television may have attributes of screen size, screen format, brand, price and so on. Each attribute can then be broken down into a number of levels. For instance, levels for screen format may be LED, LCD, or Plasma.

Respondents are shown a set of products, prototypes, mock-ups, or pictures created from a combination of levels from all or some of the constituent attributes and asked to choose from, rank or rate the products they are shown. Each example is similar enough that consumers will see them as close substitutes but dissimilar enough that respondents can clearly determine a preference. Each example is composed of a unique combination of product features. The data may consist of individual ratings, rank orders, or choices among alternative combinations.

Conjoint design involves four different steps:
# Determine the type of study
# Identify the relevant attributes
# Specify the attributes&#x27; levels
# Design questionnaire

=== 1. Determine the type of study ===
There are different types of studies that may be designed:
* Ranking-based conjoint
* Rating-based conjoint
* Choice-based conjoint

=== 2. Identify the relevant attributes ===
Attributes in conjoint analysis should:
* be relevant to managerial decision-making,
* have varying levels in real life,
* be expected to influence preferences,
* be clearly defined and communicable,
* preferably not exhibit strong correlations (price and brand are an exception),
* consist of at least two levels.

=== 3. Specify the attributes&#x27; levels ===
Levels of attributes should be:
* unambiguous,
* mutually exclusive,
* realistic.

=== 4. Design questionnaire ===
As the number of combinations of attributes and levels increases the number of potential profiles increases exponentially. Consequently, fractional factorial design is commonly used to reduce the number of profiles to be evaluated, while ensuring enough data are available for statistical analysis, resulting in a carefully controlled set of &quot;profiles&quot; for the respondent to consider.

== Earliest form and drawbacks ==
The earliest forms of conjoint analysis starting in the 1970s were what are known as Full Profile studies, in which a small set of attributes (typically 4 to 5) were used to create profiles that were shown to respondents, often on individual cards. Respondents then ranked or rated these profiles. Using relatively simple dummy variable regression analysis the implicit utilities for the levels could be calculated that best reproduced the ranks or ratings as specified by respondents. Two drawbacks were seen in these early designs.

Firstly, the number of attributes in use was heavily restricted. With large numbers of attributes, the consideration task for respondents becomes too large and even with fractional factorial designs the number of profiles for evaluation can increase rapidly. In order to use more attributes (up to 30), hybrid conjoint techniques were developed that combined self-explication (rating or ranking of levels and attributes) followed by conjoint tasks. Both paper-based and adaptive computer-aided questionnaires became options starting in the 1980s.

The second drawback was that ratings or rankings of profiles were unrealistic and did not link directly to behavioural theory. In real-life situations, buyers choose among alternatives rather than ranking or rating them. Jordan Louviere pioneered an approach that used only a choice task which became the basis of choice-based conjoint analysis and discrete choice analysis. This stated preference research is linked to econometric modeling and can be linked to revealed preference where choice models are calibrated on the basis of real rather than survey data. Originally, choice-based conjoint analysis was unable to provide individual-level utilities and researchers developed aggregated models to represent the market&#x27;s preferences. This made it unsuitable for market segmentation studies. With newer hierarchical Bayesian analysis techniques, individual-level utilities may be estimated that provide greater insights into the heterogeneous preferences across individuals and market segments.

== Information collection ==
Data for conjoint analysis are most commonly gathered through a market research survey, although conjoint analysis can also be applied to a carefully designed configurator or data from an appropriately designed test market experiment. Market research rules of thumb apply with regard to statistical sample size and accuracy when designing conjoint analysis interviews.

The length of the conjoint questionnaire depends on the number of attributes to be assessed and the selected conjoint analysis method. A typical adaptive conjoint questionnaire with 20–25 attributes may take more than 30 minutes to complete. Choice based conjoint analysis, by using a smaller profile set distributed across the sample as a whole, may be completed in less than 15 minutes. Choice exercises may be displayed as a store front type layout or in some other simulated shopping environment.

==Analysis==

Because conjoint designs are complicated, they usually generate substantial measurement error (as indicated by low intra-respondent reliability), which can induce substantial bias in any direction by any amount; this bias must be corrected in statistical analyses of conjoint data. Depending on the type of model, different econometric and statistical methods can be used to estimate utility functions. These utility functions indicate the perceived value of the feature and how sensitive consumer perceptions and preferences are to changes in product features. The actual estimation procedure will depend on the design of the task and profiles for respondents and the measurement scale used to indicate preferences (interval-scaled, ranking, or discrete choice). For estimating the utilities for each attribute level using ratings-based full profile tasks, linear regression may be appropriate, for choice based tasks, maximum likelihood estimation usually with logistic regression is typically used. The original utility estimation methods were monotonic analysis of variance or linear programming techniques, but contemporary marketing research practice has shifted towards choice-based models using multinomial logit, mixed versions of this model, and other refinements. Bayesian estimators are also very popular. Hierarchical Bayesian procedures are nowadays relatively popular as well.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===
* estimates psychological tradeoffs that consumers make when evaluating several attributes together
* can measure preferences at the individual level
* uncovers real or hidden drivers which may not be apparent to respondents themselves
* mimics realistic choice or shopping task
* able to use physical objects
* if appropriately designed, can model interactions between attributes
* may be used to develop needs-based segmentation, when applying models that recognize respondent heterogeneity of tastes

===Disadvantages===
* designing conjoint studies can be complex
* when facing too many product features and product profiles, respondents often resort to simplification strategies
* difficult to use for product positioning research because there is no procedure for converting perceptions about actual features to perceptions about a reduced set of underlying features
* respondents are unable to articulate attitudes toward new categories, or may feel forced to think about issues they would otherwise not give much thought to
* poorly designed studies may over-value emotionally-laden product features and undervalue concrete features
* does not take into account the quantity of products purchased per respondent, but weighting respondents by their self-reported purchase volume or extensions such as volumetric conjoint analysis may remedy this

==Practical applications==

===Market research===

One practical application of conjoint analysis in business analysis is given by the following example: A real estate developer is interested in building a high rise apartment complex near an urban Ivy League university. To ensure the success of the project, a market research firm is hired to conduct focus groups with current students. Students are segmented by academic year (freshman, upper classmen, graduate studies) and amount of financial aid received. Study participants are shown a series of choice scenarios, involving different apartment living options specified on six attributes (proximity to campus, cost, telecommunication packages, laundry options, floor plans, and security features offered). The estimated cost to construct the building associated with each apartment option is equivalent. Participants are asked to choose their preferred apartment option within each choice scenario. This forced choice exercise reveals the participants&#x27; priorities and preferences. Multinomial logistic regression may be used to estimate the utility scores for each attribute level of the six attributes involved in the conjoint experiment. Using these utility scores, market preference for any combination of the attribute levels describing potential apartment living options may be predicted.

The market research approach, Mind Genomics (MG), is an application of Conjoint Analysis (CA). CA is carried out to evaluate consumer acceptance, presenting them with a set of product attributes and assessing their preferences for different attribute combinations by estimating the utility scores for different attribute levels. MG applying CA delves deeper into the psychological and emotional aspects that influence decision-making, assisting in the initial identification of the attributes that are most salient to consumers and helping researchers refine the attributes to be used in CA.

In a private opinion survey by US-based Populace, they used a method called choice-based conjoint (CBC) analysis to understand how Americans define success. Instead of directly asking people to define success, the survey made respondents choose between different options, simulating real-life decision-making.

===Litigation===

Federal courts in the United States have allowed expert witnesses to use conjoint analysis to support their opinions on the damages that an infringer of a patent should pay to compensate the patent holder for violating its rights. Nonetheless, legal scholars have noted that the Federal Circuit&#x27;s jurisprudence on the use of conjoint analysis in patent-damages calculations remains in a formative stage.

One example of this is how Apple used a conjoint analysis to prove the damages suffered by Samsung&#x27;s copyright infringement, and increase their compensation in the case.

<text>The Man on the Train (), called Man on the Train in the USA, is a 2002 drama film directed by Patrice Leconte that stars Jean Rochefort and Johnny Hallyday.

==Plot==
In a little French town, a rough-looking man named Milan arrives alone by train. Suffering a headache, he goes into the pharmacy for aspirin and there meets Manesquier, a cultured bachelor who lives in a large house on his own. As the only hotel has closed, Manesquier offers to put the stranger up for the night. While he is delighted to talk about his life and interests, the taciturn Milan does not say who he is or why he is there. The reason, it is revealed, is because he will link up with three other criminals and rob the town bank.

Over the next few days the two very different men start bonding, with Milan introduced to music and poetry and the aesthete Manesquier learning to be tough with women and other men. On the Saturday each is to meet his fate: Manesquier will undergo triple bypass surgery while Milan will join his fellow-criminals in holding up the bank. The robbery is a failure, as the police have been tipped off and Milan is shot down. The operation is also a failure; as Manesquier dies on the table.

In a brief surrealistic coda, each dead man returns to life and their improbable friendship resumes.

==Cast==
* Johnny Hallyday as Milan, a thief
* Jean Rochefort as Manesquier, a retired teacher
* Jean-François Stévenin as Luigi, a thief
* Charlie Nelson as Max
* Pascal Parmentier as Sadko
* Isabelle Petit-Jacques as Viviane, Manesquier&#x27;s mistress
* Édith Scob as Manesquier&#x27;s sister

==Production==
The film was shot in Annonay (Ardèche), at the Gare de Tain-l&#x27;Hermitage - Tournon in Tain-l&#x27;Hermitage (Drôme) and at the Musée des Beaux-Arts and Fourvière in Lyon.

==Release==
Paramount Classics acquired the United States distribution rights of this film and gave it a limited US theatrical release on May 9, 2003 to a total of 85 theaters; this film went on to gross $2,542,020 in United States theaters, which is a solid result for a non-English language film. Paramount Classics was ecstatic with this film&#x27;s performance in the United States market.

==Reception==

==Accolades==
The film won the audience awards at the Venice Film Festival for &quot;Best Film&quot; and &quot;Best Actor&quot; (Jean Rochefort) in 2002.

==English-language remake==
In 2011, an English-language remake of this film was released, starring Donald Sutherland as the professor and Larry Mullen, Jr. as the thief.

<doc id="296469" wikidata="Q3764998" url="?curid=296469" title="Quarters (game)">
<text>Quarters is a drinking game which involves players bouncing an American quarter or similar-size coin off a table in an attempt to have the quarter land in a certain place, usually into a shot glass (or cup) on that table. It is also played in South America, where it is called &quot;monedita,&quot; Spanish for little coin.

The player bouncing the quarter is referred to as the &quot;shooter.&quot; In some variations the glass is empty and each player has a separate glass to drink from, while in other variations the glass that the shooter is aiming for contains an alcoholic beverage.

The quarter is customarily bounced on the face whether heads or tails. Some games may allow a player to bounce the quarter on the edge, particularly by rolling it down their nose.

==Rules==
Each round starts off with a glass filled with a drink in the middle of the table and two people on opposite ends of the table having a quarter and a glass. Each player shoots his or her quarter at his/her glass until he makes it in, then the player passes the glass to the player to their left. If the player to their left still has a glass as well, the player taps that glass with theirs, and the player who has been tapped must drink from the glass in the middle of the table, refill it, then make the quarter into his or her glass before they get tapped again, with play still going around the table. If a player makes his or her first shot, s/he can choose to pass the glass to any player who does not currently have a glass. If there are enough people at the table, the group can add more shot glasses and position them equally spaced around the outside of the circle.

===Speed Quarters===

This version involves six or more people around a small table, several quarters, drinks for each player, and two empty shot glasses placed in front of opposite players. When the game begins, the two players with glasses pick up a quarter and try to bounce it off of the table into the shot glass in front of them as quickly as possible. If the shot is not made they keep shooting until one makes the shot. This player dumps the quarter out and passes the glass to the player to his left while the other shooter continues to shoot until they make a quarter into their shot glass. Eventually, when repeated enough, one glass will catch up to the other in rotation. When this happens, the player still shooting must overturn a glass and stack the other on top. This player gets two chances to bounce a quarter off of the table and into the top glass. If they make it on the first, they can pass the stacked glasses to any player, where that player get two chances, and so on. If the player makes it on the second shot, the glasses are unstacked, one passes to the player on the left, and one to the player opposite. Game-play resumes from the beginning. If the player does not get a quarter into the stacked glasses in two shots, the player on their right will spin a quarter while the &quot;loser&quot; chugs their drink until the quarter ceases to spin. Any player can blow on the quarter or spin it with their finger to keep it spinning. After this, the glasses are split like when the game started and it begins again. Game-play ends when the players feel they are sufficiently inebriated.
===Other variations===
An alternative method of gameplay is that one glass is positioned in the center of the table. Participants take turns attempting to bounce the quarter into the glass. If the shooter succeeds, they pass the glass to anyone at the table, and that person must then chug the beverage and catch the quarter in their teeth. Play then passes to the person on the shooter&#x27;s left. Should the shooter fail to make the shot, they have the option of passing the quarter to the left, or shooting a second time. If the shooter succeeds on their second shot, they pass the glass as usual. If the shooter fails on their second shot, they must drink the beverage. In either case, the person on their left becomes the next shooter.

Another method involves various cups and one community cup. A community cup is first placed in the center of the table. Each player has their own individual cup, and these cups are placed around the community cup, forming a ring around the community cup (much like a flower pattern). Players fill their individual cups with a shot of their drink, and pour a small amount of their drink into the community cup (various drinks can be used to play, so the community cup may house a mixture of different drinks). A shooter begins by bouncing a quarter towards the cups. If the quarter lands in a player&#x27;s cup, the player must drink his/her shot, refill the cup, and place it back with the rest. If the shooter lands the quarter in to the community cup, every player must reach into the center and drink their shot. The last player to finish their drink must then drink the community cup. If the shooter makes his/her shot on the first attempt, they may shoot again until they miss. If they miss on the first attempt, they must pass the quarter to the next player on their left. This game is commonly called Ponderosa.

Another variation gives the shooter the power to make a rule if they land the quarter in the cup in a certain number of consecutive tries. The rule is often that shooters must then say a phrase, or perhaps that no one at the table can say a certain word, with the penalty being an instant drink by the offending player. This effectively speeds up the intoxication. Common rules that the shooter will create are that no one can say the word Drink, Drank, Drunk or point with their finger. Note that only one rule can be created at a time.

Any shot where the shooter does not bounce the quarter off of the table at least once counts as a miss.

==Beverages==
The players must determine beforehand how much is to be consumed each time a player is required to drink. This depends on the variation being played and the appetites of the players.

Grover&#x27;s 1996 algorithm won renown as the second major algorithm proposed for quantum computing (after Shor&#x27;s 1994 algorithm), and in 2017 was finally implemented in a scalable physical quantum system. Grover&#x27;s algorithm has been the subject of numerous popular science articles.

== Life ==
Lov Kumar Grover was born in Meerut, India in 1961.
Grover received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi in 1981 and his PhD in Electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1985. In 1984, he went to Bell Laboratories. He worked as a visiting professor at Cornell University from 1987 to 1994. He retired in 2008 becoming an independent researcher.

<doc id="296482" wikidata="Q1698340" url="?curid=296482" title="Mercury Comet">
<text>The Mercury Comet is an automobile that was produced by Mercury from 1962–1969 and 1971–1977 — variously as either a compact or an intermediate car. For 1960 and 1961, Comet was its own brand sold by Lincoln-Mercury &quot;Comet&quot;.

The compact Comet shared a naming convention associated with the ongoing Space Race of the early 1960s with the Mercury Meteor, which was introduced as the base-trim full-size Mercury sedan.

The Comet was initially based on the compact Ford Falcon, then on the intermediate Ford Fairlane, and finally on the compact Ford Maverick. Early Comets received better-grade interior trim than concurrent Falcons, and a slightly longer wheelbase.
&#x27;

==Relationship to Edsel==
The Comet was originally planned as an Edsel model. Ford announced the end of the Edsel program on November 19, 1959. However, production of 1960 Edsels continued until late November. The Comet was reassigned to the Lincoln-Mercury division to sell at Mercury-Comet dealerships, where it was marketed as a stand-alone product for 1960 and 1961 as the Comet without any Mercury divisional badging. Door VIN tags read &#x27;Made in U.S.A. by Comet.&#x27;

Developed concurrently with the Ford Falcon, early preproduction photographs of the sedan show a car remarkably close to the Comet that emerged, but with a split grille following the pattern established by Edsel models. Early Ford styling mules for the station wagon model carried the Edsel name, as well.
At their debut, the split grille was replaced by one more in keeping with Mercury&#x27;s design themes, but the canted elliptical taillights, first seen on the Edsel prototype, were used and carried the &quot;E&quot; (Edsel) part number on them. While the short-lived 1960 Edsels used elliptical-shaped taillights, the lenses used on both cars differed in length and width. Certain other parts from the 1959 Edsel parts bin, including the parking lights and dashboard knobs, were used on the first-year Comet. Keys for the 1960 and 1961 Comets were shaped like Edsel keys, with the center bar of the &quot;E&quot; removed to form a &quot;C&quot;.

The &quot;Comet&quot; name was trademarked to Cotner-Bevington as the Comet Coach Company, building ambulance and hearse commercial vehicles. Ford bought the name in 1959.

==Overview==
From 1960–1965, the Comet was based on the Ford Falcon platform (stretched for sedans, but not for wagons). The 1960–1963 Comets share a similar basic shape. These are sometimes referred to as the &quot;round body&quot; Comets. For 1962 and 1963, the Comet shared a considerable number of body and mechanical parts with the short-lived Fairlane-based Mercury Meteor intermediate.

==First generation (1960–1963)==

The Comet was initially released without any divisional badging, only &quot;Comet&quot; badges, similar to Valiant, which did not have Plymouth badging at first. It was sold through Lincoln-Mercury-Comet dealers, but was not branded as a Mercury Comet until the 1962 model year. This was similar to Ford&#x27;s treatment of the Meteor and Frontenac of Canada, sold through Meteor-Mercury-Frontenac dealers.
Introduced in March 1960, initial body styles were two- and four-door sedans and two- and four-door station wagons. Two trim levels were available, standard and &quot;Custom&quot;, with the latter including badging, additional chrome trim, and all-vinyl interiors. In 1960, the only engine available was the 144 cid &quot;Thriftpower&quot; straight-six with a single-barrel Holley carburetor, which produced at 4200 rpm. (Some sources list it as producing at 4200 rpm.) Transmission options were a column-shifted three-speed manual and a two-speed Comet-Drive automatic transmission.

Ford had purchased the name &quot;Comet&quot; from Comet Coach Company, a professional car manufacturer in which the term belonged to a line of funeral coaches, mainly Oldsmobiles. The coach company then was renamed Cotner-Bevington.

In Canada, for the 1960 model year, Meteor-Mercury dealers sold a compact car called the &quot;Frontenac&quot;. Considered a marque in its own right, it was a badge-engineered version of the Ford Falcon with only minor trim differences to distinguish it from the Falcon. The Frontenac was produced for only one year. The Comet was introduced to the Canadian market for the 1961 model year and replaced the Frontenac as the compact offering by Meteor-Mercury dealers.
In response to complaints about the low performance of the 144 cid engine, a 170 cid &quot;Thriftpower&quot; with a single-barrel Holley carburetor producing at 4400 rpm was released for the 1961 model year. A new four-speed manual transmission was also an option (a Dagenham without first-gear synchromesh). The changes to the 1961 Comet were minimal, such as moving the Comet script from the front fender to the rear quarter and a new grille design. 

The optional S-22 package was released. Available only on the two-door sedan, it was billed as a &quot;sport&quot; package, although it shared the same mechanicals as regular Comets, with the only changes being S-22 badging, bucket seats, and a center console.

Comet was officially made a Mercury model for the 1962 model year, and it received some minor restyling, mainly a redesign of the trunk and taillight area to bring the car more in line with the Mercury look. This is the first year the car carried Mercury badging.
The S-22 had six bullet-shaped taillights, while regular Comets had four oval with two optional flat reverse lights. A Comet Villager station wagon, basically a Comet Custom four-door station wagon with simulated woodgrain side panels, was added to the lineup. (The Villager name had previously been used to denote the four-door, steel-sided station wagon in the Edsel Ranger series.) The Comet Drive automatic transmission was renamed Merc-O-Matic (unique to the Comet, despite sharing a name with the Merc-O-Matic installed in larger Mercurys).

While the 1963 model looked almost identical to the earlier models, the chassis and suspension were redesigned to accommodate an optional 260 cid V8 engine (borrowed from the Fairlane) using a two-barrel carburetor and producing . Two new body styles, a Convertible and hardtop (pillar-less) coupe models were added to the Comet Custom and Comet S-22 lines this year. 

The front ends of these Comets differed from their Falcon counterparts in that they had four headlights instead of two; similar situations resurfaced in the late 1970s, with the Ford Thunderbird/Mercury Cougar and the Ford Fairmont/Mercury Zephyr.

==Second generation (1964–1965)==

The 1964 Comet was redesigned with a much more square shape, though it was still built on the same unibody as the 1963 model. Its basic lines were shared with the new Falcon, but the front grille used styling similar to that of the Lincoln Continental. Along with the redesign, the model designations were changed. The performance version was known as the Cyclone, replacing the previous S-22. Then in descending order of trim levels were the Caliente, 404, and 202, replacing the previous Custom and base models. The two-door station wagon bodystyle was discontinued. The top-of-the-line station wagon continued to be known as the Villager. The 144 inline-six engine was dropped, leaving the 170 as the base engine. The 260 V8 was available at the beginning of the production run, with the new 289 being available mid-year. Due to the success of the full-sized Ford and Mercury &quot;fastback&quot; roofline introduced in mid-1963, the Falcon and Comet two-door hardtops got a similar roofline with sharper corners.

For 1964, Ford produced about 50 ultra-high performance, lightweight Comet Cyclones, equipped with their racing two-carburetor 427 engine, similar to the related Ford Thunderbolt. To avoid competing with each other, the Thunderbolts ran in Super Stock on tires, but the Cyclones were modified to run in A/FX on tires, where they were as dominant as the Thunderbolts were in Super Stock. Drivers included Ronnie Sox, Don Nicholson, and Wild Bill Shrewsberry in conjunction with Jack Chrisman. Shrewsberry still owns his original 427 Comet in Caliente trim.

For 1965, the Comet received updated styling front and rear (including stacked headlights, similar to what full-sized Fords, Pontiacs, and Cadillacs would use at the same time). The base six-cylinder engine was increased from ; still using a single-barrel carburetor, it produced at 4400 rpm. The base V8 engine was increased from and, using a two-barrel carburetor, it produced at 4400 rpm. The standard transmission continued as a column-shifted, three-speed manual transmission. The optional automatic was changed to a &quot;Merc-O-Matic&quot; three-speed automatic transmission (essentially a Ford C4). The 289 V8 was available in three horsepower ratings: base two-barrel 200 hp, four-barrel , and the high-performance version from the Ford Mustang, paired with a four-speed manual transmission.

==Third generation (1966–1967)==
Beginning in 1966, the Comet grew from a compact to become a mid-sized car. It was now based on the same chassis as the Ford Fairlane intermediate (and the previous Mercury Meteor intermediate, which was only offered in 1962–1963). These intermediate-sized cars used the same basic chassis as the original Ford Falcon and Mercury Comet compacts, but were stretched with longer wheelbases. The previous-generation Comet shared its platform with the all-new Ford Mustang in 1964, and when the Comet graduated to the intermediate platform, the Mercury Cougar became the platform shared with the Mustang.

The Comet wagon introduced a Dual-Action tailgate, able to both fold down or swing aside, an idea soon copied by all the major U.S. manufacturers.

The 1966 Comet received distinct outer body panels. The Comet Capri replaced the previous Comet 404 and the Comet Voyager four-door station wagon replaced the previous Comet 404 station wagon. The Voyager name had previously been used to designate a full-sized Mercury station wagon that was positioned between the base Commuter and the top-of-the-line Colony Park station wagon models. The Comet 202 four-door station wagon was discontinued. The new top-of-the-line series was the Comet Cyclone GT.

New engines available in the Comet for 1966 included a 390 cid V8 engine with a two-barrel carburetor producing at 4400 rpm, a 390 cid V8 engine with a four-barrel carburetor producing , and 390 cid V8 engine that produced . The 335 hp 390 cid V8 engine was standard on the Cyclone GT and optional on other models. The Cyclone GT when equipped with an automatic transmission was referred to as the Cyclone GTA.

A Cyclone GT convertible was the pace car for the 1966 Indianapolis 500.

Beginning with the 1967 model year, the Comet name was used only on the base Comet 202 model, available only in two- or four-door sedan body styles. Other models were now referred to by what had previously been their subseries names. Mercury&#x27;s mid-sized line-up ranged from the basic Comet 202, through the Capri, Caliente, Cyclone, and Cyclone GT models, as well as steel-sided Voyager and simulated wood-paneled Villager station wagon models, which were comparable to the Capri.

==Fourth generation (1968–1969)==
In 1968, Mercury&#x27;s mid-sized models again received new sheet metal and styling that resembled the full-sized Mercury models and shared their chassis and many parts with Ford&#x27;s mid-sized Fairlane and Torino models. The mid-sized base model was the Comet (Mercury dropped the 202 suffix) available only as a two-door coupe. The Capri was replaced by the Montego, and the Caliente by the Montego MX. Also, the more luxurious Montego MX Brougham was basically an option package for the Montego MX. Top-of-the-line, mid-sized models continued to use the Cyclone and Cyclone GT names.

A 302 cid V8 engine using a two-barrel carburetor and generating at 4600 rpm would replace the previous 289 cid V8 midway in the 1968 model year. For the 1969 model year, the grille was modified and the headlight surrounds were removed. The taillights were also slightly restyled. Few changes to Mercury&#x27;s mid-sized lineup were made for the 1969 model year, the last year that the Comet name graced a mid-sized model. A Comet four-door sedan for 1969 was supposedly planned, but never offered. New top-of-the-line Cyclone Spoiler and Cyclone CJ models joined the lineup.

A 250 cid inline-six using a single-barrel carburetor and generating at 4000 rpm replaced the previous 200 cid 6 as standard. New engine options included a 302 cid V-8 engine using a four-barrel carburetor and generating at 4400 rpm (standard on the Cyclone), a 351 cid V-8 using a four-barrel carburetor generating at 5200 rpm (standard on the Cyclone Spoiler), and a 428 cid V-8 using a four-barrel carburetor generating at 5200 rpm (standard on the Cyclone CJ). These new V-8s replaced the previous 390 cid V-8s.

After 1969, the use of the Comet name was suspended as the base model for Mercury&#x27;s intermediate model line became the Montego. The Cyclone name continued to be used through the 1971 model year. 


==Fifth generation (1971–1977)==
For 1971, the Comet name was revived on Mercury&#x27;s version of the Ford Maverick compact. Sharing most of its sheet metal with the Maverick, it used a different grille, taillights, and hood, as well as different badging. The taillight pods were shared with the 1970 and 1971 Montego and Cyclone models. Underneath it all was the same basic chassis that had originally been used for the Ford Falcon, the original Comet, and for the mid-sized Ford Fairlane, Mercury Meteor, and later Mercury Comets.

The base engine was the 170 cid inline-six with a single-barrel carburetor producing at 4200 rpm. Optional engines were the 200 cid inline-six with a single-barrel carburetor producing and a 302 cid V8 with a two-barrel carburetor producing . Transmissions were either a three-speed manual or three-speed automatic with either column or floor-mounted shifters.

The Comet was available as two- and four-door sedans and in base (1971–1977), and &quot;muscle car&quot; Comet GT series (two-door sedan-only 1971-1975). The GT featured a blacked-out grille, dual body-side tape stripes, high-back bucket seats, wheel trim rings, dual racing mirrors, bright window frames, black instrument panel, deluxe door trim panels, and a simulated hood scoop.

In 1972 models, the base 170 cid six was rated at at 4400 rpm, the 200 cid six at , and the 302 cid V8 at . A new engine option for 1972 was the 250 cid six with a single-barrel carburetor rated at .
For 1973 models, the base 170 cid six was dropped and the 200 cid six became the base engine. Horsepower ratings would fluctuate slightly up or down through the years the Comet would remain in production, but not by very much. A new, larger front bumper to meet federal standards was added to all models in 1973. A new Custom decor package featuring vinyl roof, body-colored wheel covers, wide vinyl-insert body-side moldings, vinyl bucket seats, luxury carpeting, and extra sound insulation was a popular option.

Changes for 1974 included even larger front bumpers and new larger rear bumpers to match due to new federal mandates for safety. They added to the length of the two-door model and to the length of the four-door model.

Ford had originally planned to the replace the Comet and its Ford Maverick counterpart for the 1975 model year with updated and extensively redesigned models that would continue to use the Comet and Maverick names. Fairly late, though, they decided that the updated versions would be built alongside the original Maverick and the Comet that had originally been introduced for 1971. These would-be replacements, also using the same basic chassis as the Comet and Maverick, became the Mercury Monarch and the American Ford Granada; these came with more standard and optional equipment than the Comet and Maverick, and were considered to be &quot;luxury compacts&quot;, a step up from the Comet and Maverick.

Although 1975 was the last year for the Mercury Comet GT, the GT features remained available in 1976 and 1977 with the &quot;Sports Accent&quot; option group.

The model was offered with comparatively few changes through the 1977 model year, and was then discontinued to make room for the new Mercury Zephyr for the 1978 model year.

==High mileage record==
In July 2010, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported on a 91-year-old Florida woman, Rachel Veitch, who was still driving her 1964 Comet Caliente daily. The car was purchased new, and Veitch set a record by accumulating over 562,000 documented miles. The car was retired in 2012 after accumulating 576,000 miles, as Veitch had decided to stop driving due to her eyesight becoming too weak.

==Mercury Cyclone==

The Cyclone was a performance model of the Comet, built from 1964–1971 and mirroring the Comet&#x27;s changes. The 1971 model year was the Cyclone&#x27;s last, as the muscle car wars wound down, and it was absorbed into the Mercury Montego line.

<doc id="296498" wikidata="Q487193" url="?curid=296498" title="Japan–Korea disputes">
<text>There have been a number of significant disputes between various Koreanic and Japonic states. The two regions have a long history of relations as immediate neighbors that has been marked with conflict. One of the most significant issues is the Japanese colonization of Korea that began with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910 and ended with the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II.

Although South Korea was established in 1948, Japan–South Korea relations only officially began in 1965 with the signing of the Basic Treaty that normalized their relations. Today, Japan and South Korea are major trading partners, and many students, tourists, entertainers, and business people travel between the two countries. Despite strong economic cooperation between the two countries, ongoing territorial and historical issues exist between the two nations.

Relations between Japan and North Korea are not yet normalized, and there are ongoing historical, geopolitical and nuclear issues between the two nations.

== Background ==

With the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876, Japan decided to expand their initial settlements and acquired an enclave in Busan. In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95, Japan defeated the Qing dynasty, and had released Korea from the tributary system of Qing China by concluding the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which compelled the Qing to acknowledge Yi Dynasty Korea as an independent country. Japan encouraged the modernization of Korea. However, the ruling Min clan, including the Queen Min took precautions against Japan due to its increasing dominance and influence within the Korean peninsula. In 1895, Queen Min was assassinated by Japan after seeking to promote Russian influence and oppose reform.

=== Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty ===

In 1897, Joseon was renamed to the Korean Empire (1897–1910), affirming its independence, but greatly gravitated closer to Russia, with the King ruling from the Russian legation, and then using Russian guards upon return to his palace. Japan declared war on Russia to drive out Russian influence, and ended the war by imposing the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905. Korea became a protectorate of Japan, a precursor to its annexation. Itō Hirobumi, who was the first prime minister of Japan and one of the elder statesmen, was Resident-General of Korea and was opposed to the annexation of Korea. However, the power balance in domestic Japan grew in favor of the annexation, in part because of Itō&#x27;s assassination in 1909 by An Jung-Geun. On August 22, 1910, Japan had formally annexed Korea through the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty.

In 1910, Japan annexed Korea. The legality of the annexation and the subsequent 35-years of occupation of the Korean Peninsula by Japan are controversial. Both have been criticized as illegal based on the fact that the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905 was signed under duress, as well as its never having been ratified by Gojong of Korea. Some Japanese scholars have challenged this view of the treaty as invalid.

=== Post-war Korea ===
Kim Il Sung had led a Korean independence movement, which was active in the border areas between China and Russia, particularly in areas with considerable ethnic Korean populations. Kim founded North Korea, and his descendants have still not signed a peace treaty with Japan. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, led by (later) South Korea&#x27;s first president Syngman Rhee, had moved from Shanghai to Chongqing. Lee lobbied the United States and was recognized by the South Korean administrator by Douglas MacArthur. Japanese control of Korea ended on September 9, 1945, when the Governor-General of Korea signed the instrument of surrender document to United States in Seoul.

=== Normalization of bilateral relations and compensation ===
Twenty years after World War II, South Korea and Japan re-established diplomatic relations with the 1965 signing of the Treaty on Basic Relations. In 2005, South Korea disclosed diplomatic documents that detailed the proceedings of the treaty. Kept secret in South Korea for 40 years, the documents revealed that Japan provided 500 million dollars in soft loans and 300 million in grants to South Korea as compensation for the reign of Japan. South Korea agreed to demand no more compensation after the treaty, either at a government-to-government level or an individual-to-government level. It was also revealed that the South Korean government assumed the responsibility for compensating individuals on a lump sum basis while rejecting Japan&#x27;s proposal for direct compensation.

== Historical issues following normalization ==

=== Individual compensation ===
With the Basic Treaty signed between countries, Japan had compensated the Korean government for both its peacetime occupation and wartime activities. The South Korean government used most of the loans for economic development and paid 300,000 won per death, with only a total of 2,570 million won to the relatives of 8,552 victims who died in forced labor. Korean victims had filed a compensation lawsuit against the South Korean government as of 2005. Subsequent lawsuits in South Korea have had contradictory results as to whether Japan and Japanese companies are still liable for individual compensation from their action during the occupation. Japan claims that all of its and Japanese companies responsibilities have been met by the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations. Women&#x27;s International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan&#x27;s Military Sexual Slavery, a mock trial organised by and supported by Japanese NGO Women&#x27;s International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan&#x27;s Military Sexual Slavery, issued a ruling that &quot;states cannot agree by treaty to waive the liability of another state for crimes against humanity&quot;.

Diplomatic relations over compensation flared up again following a 2018 ruling by the Supreme Court of Korea which ordered Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to pay compensation to the families of 28 Koreans who were forced laborers. Japan had viewed the Treaty as having been the final instrument of compensation, while the South Korean government backed the ruling of its highest court. The government of Moon Jae-in viewed the Treaty as not having abrogated the rights of individuals to seek compensation.

In July 2019, Prime Minister of Japan Shinzō Abe accused the government of South Korea of not having an &quot;appropriate response to its breach&quot; of the treaty. In response, Blue House spokeswoman Ko Min-jung advised that the two countries&#x27; governments &quot;not [to] cross the line and make [the] utmost efforts for future cooperation between the two countries and their people.&quot; Moon Jae-In had further called for &quot;technological innovation&quot; so that South Korea relied less on Japan, in the context of ongoing trade wars and South Korean reliance on Japanese technological imports. This issue had significantly impacted South Korea–Japan military cooperation and economic trade.

=== Formal apologies for colonization ===
==== South Korea ====
Although diplomatic relations were established by treaty in 1965, South Korea continues to request an apology and compensation for Korea under Japanese rule. The Japanese government has apologized officially many times. In 2012, The South Korean government asked that Emperor Akihito should apologize for Japan&#x27;s colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.
Some Japanese Prime Ministers have issued apologies, including Prime Minister Obuchi in the Japan–South Korea Joint Declaration of 1998, but many have not. Survey evidence suggests that Japanese citizens with conservative ideologies and hierarchical group dispositions tend to resist issuing apologies. Even in education, there is only a footnote about comfort women in Japanese textbooks. In one example in 2005, the Koizumi Cabinet did not participate, but 47 Diet members visited Yasukuni shrine for a memorial service at exactly the same time Prime Minister Koizumi was issuing the apology. This was portrayed by South Korean Media as a contradiction and has caused many South Koreans to distrust and discard Japanese statements of apology.

==== North Korea ====
Prime Minister Junichirō Koizumi, in the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration of 2002, said: &quot;I once again express my feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology, and also express the feelings of mourning for all victims, both at home and abroad, in the war.&quot;

=== Return of Korean remains ===
In the 1970s, requests were made for Japan to return the remains of around 38,000 Korean people (specifically their noses) from the nose tomb Mimizuka in Kyoto. These noses were cut off the faces of people during the Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592 to 1598. The noses have still not been returned to Korea, although some Koreans wish to keep them there as a monument to Japan&#x27;s brutal treatment of Koreans during the invasion.

During the Japanese occupation of Korea (particularly during World War II), Japan mobilized 700,000 laborers from Korea to sustain industrial production, mainly in mining. Some of them eventually returned to Korea after the war, with some dying in Japan during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, or the other Allied bombings of Japan. The high death toll may also have had other causes in the harsh conditions of the war. Corporations, such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui and others, stated that the culpability should fall on the government and not on private companies. The government distributed funds to companies for the purposes of worker repatriation. Japanese companies paid out sums at the end of the war to Chinese work leaders intended for Chinese labourers to return home to China, but the money went missing after distribution to the Chinese workers. Later, the People&#x27;s Republic of China and South Korea requested help in finding the dead bodies of kidnapped Chinese and Korean laborers for proper burial. The situation prevented China and South Korea from appropriately coordinating their efforts, and they have only identified a few hundred bodies. In addition, Korean workers began demanding their unpaid wages immediately after Japan&#x27;s surrender and continue to do so today. The issue remains salient in South Korea.

=== Return of Korean cultural artifacts ===
The Japanese rule of Korea also resulted in the relocation of tens of thousands of cultural artifacts to Japan. The issue over where these articles should be located began during the U.S. occupation of Japan. In 1965, as part of the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea, Japan returned roughly 1,400 artifacts to Korea, and considered the diplomatic matter to have been resolved. Korean artifacts are retained in the Tokyo National Museum and in the hands of many private collectors.

In 1994, hundreds of books of the Heart Sutra which were donated by the Goryeo Dynasty to Japan in 1486 were stolen from a temple. The following year, three damaged books out of these hundreds were discovered in South Korea and registered as National Treasure no. 284. In 2002, thieves stole another medieval gift and a Japanese biography of Prince Shōtoku, and donated them to a temple in Korea.

According to the South Korean government, there are 75,311 cultural artifacts that were taken from Korea. Japan has 34,369, the United States has 17,803, and France has several hundred, which were seized in the French expedition to Korea and loaned back to Korea in 2010 without an apology. In 2010, Prime Minister of Japan Naoto Kan expressed &quot;deep remorse&quot; for the removal of artifacts, and arranged an initial plan to return the Royal Protocols of the Joseon Dynasty and over 1,200 other books, which was carried out in 2011.

=== Comfort women ===


Many South Koreans have demanded compensation for &quot;comfort women&quot;, the women who were forced to work in Imperial Japanese military brothels during World War II. Enlisted to the military &quot;comfort stations&quot; through force, including kidnapping, coercion, and deception, the Korean comfort women, most of them under the age of 18, were forced to serve. As the few surviving comfort women continued to demand acknowledgement and a sincere apology, the Japanese court rejected their compensation claims.

In November 1990, was established in South Korea. As of 2008, a lump sum payment of 43 million South Korean won and a monthly payment of ₩0.8 million won were given to the survivors by the Korean government. In 1993, the government of Japan officially acknowledged the presence of wartime brothels, and set up a private Asian Women&#x27;s Fund to distribute donated money and issue official letters of apology to the victims. Today, many of the surviving comfort women are in their 80s. As of 2007, according to South Korean government, there are 109 survivors in South Korea and 218 in North Korea. The survivors in South Korea protest every Wednesday in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul, Korea. The protest was held for the 1000th time in December 2011.

In July 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution calling for Japan to apologize for forcing women into sex slavery during World War II. The resolution was sponsored by Mike Honda (D-CA), a third-generation Japanese-American. On December 13, 2007, the European Parliament adopted a resolution demanding that the Japanese government apologize to the survivors of Japan&#x27;s military sexual slavery system. This resolution was passed with 54 ayes out of 57 parliament members present.

On December 28, 2015, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe and South Korean President Park Geun-hye reached a formal agreement to settle the dispute. Japan agreed to pay ¥1 billion (₩9.7 billion; $8.3 million) to a fund supporting surviving victims while South Korea agreed to refrain from criticizing Japan regarding the issue and to work to remove a statue memorializing the victims from in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul. The announcement came after Japanese foreign minister Fumio Kishida met his counterpart Yun Byung-se in Seoul, and later Abe phoned Geun-hye to repeat the apologies already offered by Japan. The South Korean government will administer the fund for elderly comfort women. The agreement was firstly welcomed by the majority of the former comfort women (36 out of 47 existed former comfort women at that time) and the payment was received by them. However, Moon Jae-in utilized the criticism against the agreement for his presidential election supported by an activist group, the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, which criticized the agreement and persuaded the women to deny the payment.
After Moon Jae-in become the president, South Korea government decided again keep the issue of &quot;Comfort Woman&quot; as a dispute between the two countries by discarding the 2015 agreement and shut down the Japan-funded comfort women foundation which was launched in July 2016 to finance the agreement&#x27;s settlement on November 21, 2018.

In 2020, a former comfort woman Lee Yong-soo accused the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan and Yoon Mee-hyang, the former head of the council, of misusing funds and embezzlement. Some newspapers criticize the council and Yoon Mee-hyang because they seemed to amplify the problem by just criticizing Japan and exploited the former comfort women, although they said they are working for resolve the dispute and working for the former comfort women.

=== Japanese prime ministers&#x27; visits to Yasukuni Shrine ===
Yasukuni Shrine is a Shinto shrine that memorializes Japanese armed forces members killed in wartime. It was constructed as a memorial during the Meiji period to house the remains of those who died for Japan. The shrine houses the remains of Hideki Tojo (東条英機), the Prime Minister and Army Minister of Japan between 1941 and 1944, and 13 other Class A war criminals, from 1978 onwards. Yasukuni Shrine has been a subject of controversy, containing a memorial for 1,043 Japanese and 23 Korean B and C war criminals who were executed, as well as the 14 Japanese A-class war criminals. The presence of these war criminals among the dead honoured at Yasukuni Shrine has meant that visits to Yasukuni have been seen by Chinese and South Koreans as apologism for the wartime era.

Yasuhiro Nakasone and Ryutaro Hashimoto visited Yasukuni Shrine in, respectively, 1986 and 1996, and paid respects as Prime Minister of Japan, drawing intense opposition from Korea and China. Junichirō Koizumi visited the shrine and paid respects six times during his term as Prime Minister of Japan, with the first visit on August 13, 2001, stating that he was &quot;paying homage to the servicemen who died [in the] defense of Japan&quot;. These visits again drew strong condemnation and protests from Japan&#x27;s neighbors, mainly China and South Korea. As a result, the heads of the two countries refused to meet with Koizumi, and there were no mutual visits between Chinese and Japanese leaders after October 2001 and between South Korean and Japanese leaders after June 2005. The President of South Korea, Roh Moo-hyun, had suspended all summit talks between South Korea and Japan until 2008 when he resigned from office. The former prime minister, Shinzō Abe, made several visits to the shrine, the most recent being in December 2013.

=== Nationalist historiography ===
Most anthropologists and historians acknowledge that Japan has historically been actively engaged with its neighbors China and Korea, as well as Southeast Asia. Among these neighbors, Chinese culture came to Japan from the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Japanese and Korean peoples share closely linked ethnic, cultural and anthropological histories; a point of controversy between nationalist scholars in Japan and Korea rests on which culture came first, and can thus be considered the forebear of the other.

Modern historiography is also a seat of discord. In South Korea, popular debates about &quot;cleansing history&quot; () focus on finding and recriminating &quot;collaborators&quot; with Japanese colonial authorities. In North Korea, the songbun system of ascribed status is used to punish citizens with collaborating relatives or ancestors.

On the other hand, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) reviews and approves the content of school history textbooks available for selection by Japanese schools. Foreign scholars, as well as many Japanese historians, have criticized the political slant and factual errors in some approved textbooks. After a textbook by the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform (JSHTR) passed inspection in April 2001, the South Korean government, 59 NGOs from South Korea and Japan, and some Japanese teachers&#x27; unions, registered objections to certain passages&#x27; omission of Imperial Japanese war crimes including comfort women and the Rape of Nanking. Although Tsukurukai&#x27;s textbook has sold six hundred thousand copies in the general market, it has been adopted by less than 0.39% of Japanese schools. In 2010, another textbook by the JSHTR passed inspection and was published by Jiyusha (自由社).

=== Issue of pro-Japanese collaborators ===

In Korea, people whose ancestors worked or are regarded to have worked for Japanese colonial ruling are criticized. A civic organization publish the list of pro-Japanese collaborators (see Chinilpa). The list is used to tell who was Japanese friendly and Korean people try to dig up and destroy the tomb of the listed people. Korean government accelerate this movement by enacting the Special law to redeem pro-Japanese collaborators&#x27; property in 2005 and nationalize land and other properties owned by descendants of pro-Japanese collaborators.

=== Dispute over different view of history ===
Because of many issues and received education, Japanese and Korean people&#x27;s views of history are different. The parts of both views sometimes do not depend on the historical facts but based on the image of movies or novels.

== Geographic disputes ==

=== Liancourt Rocks ===
The Liancourt Rocks, called Dokdo (독도, 獨島; &quot;solitary island&quot;) in Korean and Takeshima (竹島; &quot;bamboo island&quot;) in Japanese, are a group of islets in the Sea of Japan whose ownership is disputed between South Korea and Japan. There are valuable fishing grounds around the islets and potentially large reserves of methane clathrate.

The territorial dispute is a major source of nationalistic tensions. Since the South Korean government bases its legitimacy partly on the notion that it defends South Korea from North Korea in the North and from Japan from the south, nationalism has been stoked over this issue. Korean tourists visit the remote, inhospitable island, in order to show national solidarity. In Japan, maps mark the islands as being Japanese territory.

On August 10, 1951, a secret correspondence currently known as the Rusk documents was sent to South Korea communicating the then U.S. position on issues of territorial sovereignty in the Peace Treaty explaining why the U.S. believed Liancourt Rocks were Japanese territory: &quot;This normally uninhabited rock formation was according to our information never treated as part of Korea and, since about 1905, has been under the jurisdiction of the Oki Islands Branch Office of Shimane Prefecture of Japan. The island does not appear ever before to have been claimed by Korea.&quot; In September 1954 and March 1962, Japan proposed to South Korea that the dispute be referred to the International Court of Justice, but South Korea rejected the proposals. In 2005, members of the Japanese prefecture of Shimane (the prefecture to which the islands belong according to the Japanese claim) declared &quot;Takeshima Day&quot;, to highlight their territorial claim to the islands. Japan again proposed bringing the dispute to the International Court of Justice in August 2012, which was also officially rejected by South Korea on August 30, 2012.

Although the Liancourt Rocks are claimed by both Japan and (both) Koreas, the rocks are controlled by South Korea, which has the South Korean coast guard stationed there, as well as two elderly Korean residents.

=== Tsushima ===
A small minority of Koreans claim this island as belonging to Korea, although the South Korean government does not make this claim. Called &quot;Tsushima&quot; in Japanese and &quot;Daemado&quot; in Korean, this island was recorded on the Chinese history book as a territory of Japan from ancient times. This island, as Tsushima Province, has been ruled by Japanese governments since the Nara period. According to Homer Hulbert, this island was a dependency to Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. However, according to the Korean history book Samguk Sagi written in 1145, Tsushima is ruled by the Japanese from CE 400. In the 15th century, King Sejong of Joseon sent troops to the island and occupied it after demanding it pay taxes to the Korean government.

In 1948, the South Korean government formally demanded that the island be ceded to South Korea based on &quot;historical claims&quot;. However, the claim was rejected by SCAP in 1949. On July 19, 1951, the South Korean government agreed that the earlier demand for Tsushima had been dropped by the South Korean government with regards to the Japanese peace treaty negotiations.

In 2010, a group of 37 members of the South Korean congress formed a forum to study Korea&#x27;s territorial claims to Tsushima and make outreach efforts to the public. They said that Tsushima was a part of Korean history and that the people on the island are closely related to Koreans. Yasunari Takarabe, incumbent Mayor of Tsushima rejects the South Korean territorial claim: &quot;Tsushima has always been Japan. I want them to retract their wrong historical perception. It was mentioned in the (a chapter of volume 30 of Book of Wei in the Chinese Records of the Three Kingdoms) as part of Wa (Japan). It has never been and cannot be a South Korean territory.&quot;

=== The Sea of Japan naming dispute ===
There is dispute over the international name for this body of water. Japan points out that the name &quot;Sea of Japan&quot; () was used in a number of European maps from the late 18th century to the early 19th century, and that many maps today retain this naming. However, both the North and South Korean governments have protested that Japan encouraged the usage of the name &quot;Sea of Japan&quot; while Korea lost effective control over its foreign policy under Japanese imperial expansion. South Korea argues that the name &quot;East Sea&quot; or &quot;Korean Eastern Sea&quot; (), which was one of the most common names found on old European maps of this sea, should be the name instead of (or at least used concurrently with) &quot;Sea of Japan.&quot;

Japan claims that Western countries named it the &quot;Sea of Japan&quot; prior to 1860, before the growth of Japanese influence over Korean foreign policy after the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894. Further, Japan claims that the primary naming occurred during the period of Sakoku, when Japan had very little foreign contact, and thus Japan could not have influenced the naming decisions. It was in 1929, when the International Hydrographic Organization&#x27;s &quot;Limits of Oceans and Seas&quot; used the name &quot;Sea of Japan&quot;, which eventually influenced other official international documents such as the United Nations. South Korea claims that Korea was occupied by the Japanese and effectively had no international voice to protest in 1929.

== Miscellaneous issues ==

=== Statements by Japanese politicians on colonial rule ===
Since the 1950s, many prominent politicians and officials in Japan have made statements on Japanese colonial rule in Korea which created outrage and led to diplomatic scandals in Korean–Japanese relations. The statements have led to anti-Japanese sentiments among Koreans, and a widespread perception that Japanese apologies for colonial rule have been insincere and discarded due to these statements.

During the talks between Japan and Korea in 1953, Kan&#x27;ichirō Kubota, one of the Japanese representatives, stated: &quot;Japanese colonial rule was beneficial to Korea ... Korea would have been colonized by other countries anyway, which would have led to harsher rules than Japanese rules.&quot; Many Koreans consider this remark to be the first reckless statement made by Japanese politicians about colonial rule in Korea.

In 1997, Shinzō Abe, then a member of the House of Representatives and former Prime Minister of Japan, stated: &quot;Many so-called victims of comfort women system are liars ... prostitution was ordinary behavior in Korea because the country had many brothels.&quot;

On May 31, 2003, Tarō Asō, then the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications and later Prime Minister, stated that &quot;the change to Japanese name (創氏改名) during Japanese colonial rule was what Koreans wanted&quot;.

On October 28, 2003, Shintaro Ishihara, then Governor of Tokyo, stated: &quot;The annexation of Korea and Japan was Koreans&#x27; choice ... the ones to be blamed are the ancestors of Koreans.&quot;

In 2007, Hakubun Shimomura, then Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Japanese government, stated: &quot;The comfort women system existed, but I believe it was because Korean parents sold their daughters at that time.&quot;

On March 27, 2010, on the centennial of Japan–Korean annexation, Yukio Edano, then Japanese Minister of State for Government Revitalization, stated that &quot;The invasion and colonization of China and Korea was historically inevitable ... since China and Korea could not modernize themselves.&quot;

=== Censorship of Japanese media in South Korea ===

After the end of Japanese Occupation, Japanese cultural products such as music, film, and books were banned in both North and South Korea. The boycott was lifted in South Korea starting in 1998. Some Japanese cultural items, including but not limited to manga, anime, and music, have been introduced into South Korea even while they were banned (the South Korean public was not informed of their Japanese origin, though people mostly knew that they were).

It is still illegal to broadcast Japanese music and television dramas over terrestrial signals in South Korea.

The Japanese anime &quot;&quot;, a satire series that personifies various nations created by Hidekaz Himaruya, was banned from airing on the Japanese TV Station, Kid Station, after many protests arrived from South Korea about how the character that represents South Korea was a disgrace and did not represent South Koreans correctly. This is in spite of the fact that a Korean character does not appear in any episode of the animated series, though it appears on web comic versions. The animation continues to see distribution through mobile networks and internet streaming.

=== Kidnapping of Japanese citizens by North Korea ===
A 13-year-old junior high school student from Niigata, Megumi Yokota, was kidnapped by North Korea on November 15, 1977. In addition to her, many other Japanese citizens were kidnapped by North Korean agents. In 2002, North Korea admitted to kidnapping 13 Japanese citizens during the 1970s and 1980s, in order to train spies to infiltrate U.S. military installations in Japan. Five people have been released, but the North Korean government claimed that there were eight dead. Japan has pressed for the return of the bodies. However, the Japanese government believes that there are still kidnapped Japanese citizens being held captive in North Korea. North Korea&#x27;s official statement is that the issue has been settled. Because of the overwhelming number of South Koreans also kidnapped by North Korea, there have been some joint efforts by South Korea and Japan to retrieve their citizens. The issue remains unresolved, but Japan has insisted on an explanation of what happened to their citizens as a precondition for normalizing relations with North Korea.

=== Korean influence on early Japanese culture ===

Archeological evidence shows that Korea has historically acted as a cross-roads through which, as part of a long history of contact, several important Chinese innovations in culture and technology were transferred to Japan. Several linguistic theories make similar points. In these theories, practices like wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery, metallurgy, and writing were introduced from China and Korea. Buddhism was first introduced to Japan from Baekje in Korea, but the subsequent development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China. Other cultural artifacts that have now become traditional cultural artifacts of Japan, such as the oil-paper umbrella, are also believed to have been introduced via Korea. Prince Asa, a Korean from Baekje, is known to have been Prince Shōtoku&#x27;s tutor. Emperor Kanmu&#x27;s mother Takano no Niigasa was of Korean descent, a fact admitted by Emperor Akihito during a press conference in 2001.

Many national treasures from Japan&#x27;s early history, such as the Kōryū-ji sculptures, are based on Korean prototypes or were made in Korea. In 1976, Japan stopped all foreign archaeologists from studying the circa 2nd century BC Gosashi tomb in Nara Prefecture, believed to be the resting place of Empress Jingū. In 2008, Japan allowed controlled, limited access to foreign archaeologists, but the international community still has many unanswered questions. National Geographic News reported that &quot;the agency has kept access to the tombs restricted, prompting rumors that officials fear excavation would reveal bloodline links between the &#x27;pure&#x27; imperial family and Korea—or that some tombs hold no royal remains at all.&quot;.

=== Plagiarism of Japanese products ===
South Korea has been accused of plagiarizing Japanese products. In 2007, a K-pop singer, Ivy, was accused of copying a scene from the Japanese video game movie adaptation &quot;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&quot; in one of her music videos. The court ordered that the video be banned from airing on television, stating that &quot;most of the clip is noticeably similar to scenes from the film&quot;.

=== Zainichi Koreans ===
Koreans are the third largest group of foreign nationals living in Japan, before the Chinese, Filipinos, and after the Brazilians and Peruvians. Ethnicity censuses are not available in Japan, what leaves naturalized citizens that are part of these and other immigrant populations, as well historical groups with their own identity such as the Ryukyuans, the Ainu and the mixed-race Japanese invisible, so figures giving Yamato people an amount of about 98.5% of the Japanese population are very likely exaggerated.

 Korean refers to ethnic Koreans currently residing in Japan. Most of them are second-, third-, or fourth-generation Koreans who have not applied for Japanese citizenship. Japanese law asserts that, to be a citizen of Japan, one must abdicate of every other citizenship. Some were either forced to relocate to or willingly immigrated to Japan during the Japanese occupation of Korea, while others entered Japan illegally in order to escape the Korean War that took place after the Japanese occupation. They lost their Japanese citizenship after the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, which officially ended the Japanese annexation of Korea and their country of origin, Korea, no longer existed when South Korea and North Korea became separate states. Zainichi communities are split based upon affiliation with North or South Korea (Chongryon and Mindan). It is claimed that two or three of the leaders of the smaller organized crime syndicates found on a list of more than twenty such groups as specified by the National Police Agency in Japan may be ethnic Koreans.

Utoro district, an ethnic enclave of former Korean forced laborers and their families, has been a target of anti-Korean sentiment, with a Japanese man motivated by hatred for Koreans setting fire to a home in the area in 2022.

More positively speaking, Masayoshi Son (Son Jeong-ui), a businessman and CEO of Japanese telecom giant SoftBank, is of Zainichi background. In addition, some of Japan&#x27;s baseball players and martial artists were of Zainichi Korean background, including Rikidōzan (Kim Sin-rak), Mas Oyama (Choi Yeong-eui), Isao Harimoto (Jang Hun), and Masaichi Kaneda (Kim Kyung-hong). To avoid discrimination, some Zainichi Koreans have adopted Japanese names. Today, however, as the relationship between Japan and South Korea has improved, there also exist many Zainichi Koreans or former Zainichi Koreans with Japanese nationality who do not hide their origin and are in full activity, such as Yu Miri, an Akutagawa Prize-winning playwright and Tadanari Lee (Lee Chung-Sung), a Japanese football player of Korean origin.

=== Kimchi exports ===
In the 1990s, a dispute arose regarding the marketing of kimchi, considered to be a traditional Korean dish. Kimchi was growing in popularity, and its consumption and production were expanding. Korean manufacturers, however, argued that Japanese kimchi is fundamentally different, in that Japanese manufacturers often skip fermentation and mimic the flavors through the use of additives. South Korean producers argued that this made the product fundamentally different from kimchi, while Japanese producers argued they were simply altering the product to fit local tastes. In 2000, South Korea began lobbying the makers of the Codex Alimentarius, an international food-standards maker which provides voluntary advice to national food agencies, to designate kimchi as only that which is produced in the traditional Korean style. In 2001, the Codex Alimentarius published a voluntary standard defining kimchi as &quot;a fermented food that uses salted napa cabbages as its main ingredient mixed with seasonings, and goes through a lactic acid production process at a low temperature&quot;, but which did not specify a minimum amount of fermentation or forbid the use of additives.

=== Ban on Japanese seafood products ===

From 2013, South Korea banned all seafood products imported from Fukushima and seven other Japanese prefectures, due to concerns of radioactive contamination from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The Japanese government strongly opposes South Korea&#x27;s decision on placing the ban, insisting that the country&#x27;s fisheries exports are safe for consumption, with stringent inspection procedures in place. The ban led Japan to consider taking the issue to the World Trade Organization&#x27;s dispute settlement process. In April 2019, the WTO upheld the ban.

=== Trade conflict ===
In October and November 2018, there was a decision by the Supreme Court of Korea and many high courts in the country that ordered many Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Nachi-Fujikoshi Corporation, and Nippon Steel to compensate the families of South Koreans who were unfairly treated and illegally forced to supply labor for World War II war efforts. This decisions angers the Japanese government, who claim that the issue was settled under the 1965 treaty of normalization of two countries’ bilateral ties. The Japanese government then, in retaliation, announced they would tighten chemical exports which are vital to South Korean semiconductor industry, such as Hydrogen Fluoride, resist, and fluorinated polyimide on July 1, 2019. These controls, according to the Japanese government, are in place because South Korea fails to comply with Japanese export control security regulations. But South Korea rejects the Japanese government&#x27;s claims, saying that the move was &quot;economic retaliation&quot;.

=== Coronavirus pandemic ===
Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. South Korea criticised Japan&#x27;s &quot;ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts&quot;, after Japan started to implement travel bans and quarantine measures to limit the spread of the virus from Korea.

=== Discharge of radioactive water of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant ===

Japan&#x27;s decision to release Fukushima waste water in April 2021 has emerged as a new source of tensions between the two countries.

Immediately after Japan announced its plans, the South Korean government swiftly condemned the decision and summoned the Japanese ambassador to Seoul to issue a strong protest. Civil protests have ensued across the country as a result of Japan&#x27;s decision. The South Korean government has been considering legal action against Japan, and various South Korean civil groups and associations have considered the same. Furthermore, South Korea is seeking the cooperation of other countries, such as the U.S., Denmark, and other G7 countries, for support on the issue. The dispute escalated further in June 2021 as the South Korean parliament adopted a resolution condemning Japan&#x27;s waste water discharge plan, which had passed with support across the political spectrum.

<text>Hindi literature () includes literature in the various Central Indo-Aryan languages, also known as Hindi, some of which have different writing systems. Earliest forms of Hindi literature are attested in poetry of Apabhraṃśa such as Awadhi and Marwari . Hindi literature is composed in three broad styles- prose (), poetry (), and prosimetrum (). Inspired by Bengali literature, Bharatendu Harishchandra started the modern Hindi literary practices. In terms of historical development, it is broadly classified into five prominent forms (genres) based on the date of production. They are:
* Ādi Kāl /Vīr-Gāthā Kāl (), prior to &amp; including 14th century CE
* Bhakti Kāl (), 14th–18th century CE
* Rīti Kāl /Śṛṅgār Kāl (रीति काल/ शृंगार काल), 18th–20th century CE
* Ādhunik Kāl (), from 1850 CE onwards
* Navyottar Kāl (), from 1980 CE onwards 

The literature was produced in languages and dialects such as Khariboli, Braj, Bundeli, Awadhi, Kannauji, as well as Marwari and Chhattisgarhi. From the 20th century, works produced in Modern Standard Hindi, a register of Hindustani written in the Devanagari script, are sometimes regarded as the only basis of modern literature in Hindi (excluding Urdu literature of Hindustani language).

== History ==
=== Adi Kal or Vir-Gatha kal (c. 1050 to 1375) ===
Literature of &quot;Adi kal&quot; () was developed in the regions of Kannauj, Delhi, and Ajmer stretching up to central India. &quot;Prithviraj Raso&quot;, an epic poem written by Chand Bardai (1149 – ), is considered one of the first works in the Bhraj Bhasha literature. Chand Bardai was a court poet of Prithviraj Chauhan, the famous ruler of Delhi and Ajmer during the invasion of Muhammad of Ghor.

Jayachandra, the last ruler of Kannauj gave more patronage to Sanskrit rather than local dialects. Harsha, the author of &quot;Naishdhiya Charitra&quot;, was his court poet. Jagnayak (sometimes Jagnik), the royal poet in Mahoba, and Nalha, the royal poet in Ajmer, were the other prominent literary figures in this period. However, after Prithviraj Chauhan&#x27;s defeat in the Second Battle of Tarain, most literary works belonging to this period were destroyed by the army of Muhammad of Ghor. Very few scriptures and manuscripts from this period are available and their genuineness is also doubted.

Some Siddha and Nathpanthi poetical works belonging to this period are also found, but their genuineness is doubted. The Siddhas belonged to the Vajrayana, a later Buddhist sect. Some scholars argue that the language of Siddha poetry is not an earlier form of Hindi, but Magadhi Prakrit. Nathpanthis were yogis who practised the Hatha yoga. Some Jain and &quot;Rasau&quot; (heroic poets) poetry works are also available from this period.

In the Deccan region in South India, Dakkhini or Hindvi was used. It flourished under the Delhi Sultanate and later under the Nizams of Hyderabad. It was written in the Persian script. Nevertheless, the Hindvi literature can be considered proto-Hindi literature. Many Dakkhini experts like Sheikh Ashraf or Mulla Vajahi used the word &quot;Hindvi&quot; to describe this dialect. Others such as Roustami, Nishati etc. preferred to call it Dakkhini. Shah Buharnuddin Janam Bijapuri used to call it Hindi. The first Dakkhini author was Khwaja Bandanawaz Gesudaraz Muhammad Hasan. He wrote three prose works – Mirazul Aashkini, Hidayatnama and Risala Sehwara. His grandson Abdulla Hussaini wrote &quot;Nishatul Ishq&quot;. The first Dakkhini poet was Nizami.

During the later part of this period and early Bhakti Kala, many saint poets like Ramanand and Gorakhnath became famous. The earliest form of Hindi can also be seen in some of Vidyapati&#x27;s Maithili works.

=== Bhakti kaal (c. 1375 to 1700) ===
The medieval Hindi literature is marked by the influence of Bhakti movement and composition of long and epic poems.

Awadhi and Braj Bhasha were two of the language in which literature was developed. The main works in Awadhi are Malik Muhammad Jayasi&#x27;s &quot;Padmavat&quot; and Tulsidas&#x27;s &quot;Ramacharitamanas&quot;. The major works in Braj dialect are Tulsidas&#x27;s &quot;Vinaya Patrika&quot; and Surdas&#x27;s &quot;Sur Sagar&quot;. Sadhukaddi was also a language commonly used, especially by Kabir in his poetry and dohas.

The Bhakti period also marked a great theoretical development in poetry forms chiefly from a mixture of older forms of poetry. These included Verse Patterns like &quot;Sortha&quot;, &quot;Chaupaya&quot; (four-liners) etc. This was also the age when Poetry was characterised under the various Rasas. Unlike the Adi Kaal (also called the Vir Gatha Kaal) which was characterised by an overdose of Poetry in the &quot;Vir Rasa&quot; (Heroic Poetry), the Bhakti Yug marked a much more diverse and vibrant form of poetry which spanned the whole gamut of rasas from &quot;Shringara rasa&quot; (love), &quot;Vir Rasa&quot; (Heroism).

Bhakti poetry had two schools – the &quot;Nirguna&quot; school (the believers of a formless God or an abstract name) and the &quot;Saguna&quot; school (the believers of a God with attributes and worshippers of Vishnu&#x27;s incarnations). Kabir and Guru Nanak belong to the Nirguna school, and their philosophy was greatly influenced by the Advaita Vedanta philosophy of Adi Sankaracharya. They believed in the concept of Nirgun Nirakaar Brahma or the Shapeless Formless One. The Saguna school was represented by mainly Vaishnava poets like Surdas, Tulsidas and others and was a logical extension of the Dvaita and Vishishta Advaita Philosophy propounded by the likes of Madhavacharya etc. This school was chiefly Vaishnava in orientation as in seen in the main compositions like &quot;Ramacharitamanas&quot;, &quot;Sur Saravali&quot;, &quot;Sur Sagar&quot; extolling Rama and Krishna.

This was also the age of tremendous integration between the Hindu and the Islamic elements in the arts with the advent of many Muslim Bhakti poets such as Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana, a minister to the Mughal emperor Akbar and also a great devotee of Krishna. The Nirgun School of Bhakti Poetry was also tremendously secular in nature and its proponents, including Kabir and Guru Nanak, had a large number of followers, irrespective of caste or religion.

=== Ritikavya kal (c. 1700 to 1900) ===
In the &quot;Ritikavya&quot; or &quot;Ritismagra Kavya&quot; period, the erotic element became predominant in the Hindi literature. This era is called Riti (meaning &#x27;procedure&#x27;) because it was the age when poetic figures and theory were developed to the fullest. But this emphasis on poetry theory greatly reduced the emotional aspects of poetry—the main characteristic of the Bhakti movement—and the actual content of the poetry became less important. The Saguna School of the Bhakti Yug split into two schools (Rama bhakti and Krishna bhakti) somewhere in the interregnum of the Bhakti and the Reeti Eras. Although most Reeti works were outwardly related to Krishna Bhakti, their emphasis had changed from total devotion to the supreme being to the
Shringar or erotic aspects of Krishna&#x27;s life—his Leela, his pranks with the Gopis in Braj, and the description of the physical beauty of Krishna and Radha,(Krishna&#x27;s Consort). The poetry of Bihari, and Ghananand fit this bill. The best known book from this age is the &quot;Satsai&quot; of Bihari Lal, a collection of Dohas (couplets), dealing with &quot;Bhakti&quot; (devotion), &quot;Neeti&quot; (Moral policies) and &quot;Shringar&quot; (love).

The first Hindi books, using the Devanagari script or Nāgarī script were Heera Lal&#x27;s treatise on Ain-i-Akbari, called Ain e Akbari ki Bhasha Vachanika, and Rewa Maharaja&#x27;s treatise on Kabir. Both books were published in 1795. Munshi Lallu Lal&#x27;s Hindi translation of Sanskrit Hitopadesha was published in 1809. Lala Srinivas Das published a novel, &quot;Pariksha Guru&quot;, in the Nāgarī script in 1882. Shardha Ram Phillauri wrote a Hindi novel &quot;Bhagyawati&quot; which was published in 1888.

Chandrakanta, written by Devaki Nandan Khatri in 1888, is considered the first authentic work of prose in modern Hindi. The person who brought realism in the Hindi prose literature was Munshi Premchand, who is considered the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement.

=== Adhunik kal (c. 1900 onwards) ===
In 1800, the British East India Company established Fort William College at Calcutta. The college president, John Gilchrist, hired professors to write books in Hindustani. Some of these books were &quot;Prem Sagar&quot; by Lallu Lal, &quot;Naasiketopaakhyan&quot; by Sadal Mishra, &quot;Sukhsagar&quot; by Sadasukhlal of Delhi and &quot;Rani Ketaki ki kahani&quot; by Munshi Inshallah Khan.

Modern Hindi literature has been heavily influenced by Bengali literature and the Bengal Renaissance. The person who brought realism in the Hindi prose literature was Premchand, who is considered the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement. Before Premchand, the Hindi literature revolved around fairy or magical tales, entertaining stories and religious themes. Premchand&#x27;s novels have been translated into many other languages.

====Dwivedi Yug====
The &quot;Dwivedi Yug&quot; (&quot;Age of Dwivedi&quot;) in Hindi literature lasted from 1900 to 1918. It is named after Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, who played a major role in establishing the modern Hindi language in poetry and broadening the acceptable subjects of the Hindi poetry from the traditional ones of religion and romantic love. He encouraged poetry in Hindi dedicated to nationalism and social reform.

Dwivedi became the editor of &quot;Saraswati&quot; in 1903, the first Hindi monthly magazine of India, which was established in 1900. He used it to crusade for reforms in the Hindi literature. One of the most prominent poems of the period was Maithili Sharan Gupt&#x27;s &quot;Bharat-bharati&quot;, which evokes the past glory of India. Shridhar Prathak&#x27;s &quot;Bharatgit&quot; is another renowned poem of the period.

Some scholars have labelled much of the poetry of this period as &quot;versified propaganda&quot;. According to Lucy Rosenstein: &quot;It is verse of public statement; its language is functional but aesthetically unappealing. Earnestly concerned with social issues and moral values, it is puritanical poetry in which aesthetic considerations are secondary. Imagination, originality, poetic sensibility and expression are wanting, the metre is restrictive, the idiom clumsy.&quot; She adds, however, that the period was important for laying the foundations to the modern Hindi poetry and that it did reflect sensitivity to social issues of the time. However, she also adds that the inelegance is a typical feature of a &quot;young&quot; poetry, as she considers Modern Hindi.

Without a poetic tradition in modern Hindi, poets often modeled their forms on Braj, and later on Sanskrit, Urdu, Bengali and English forms, often ill-suited to Hindi. The subjects of the poems tended to be communal rather than personal. Characters were often presented not as individuals but as social types.

====Chhayavaadi Yug====
In the 20th century, Hindi literature saw a romantic upsurge. This is known as Chhayavad, a type of neo-Romanticism, and the literary figures belonging to this school are known as Chhayavadi. Jaishankar Prasad, Suryakant Tripathi &#x27;Nirala&#x27;, Mahadevi Varma, and Sumitranandan Pant, are the four major Chhayavadi poets. Poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar was another great poet with some Chhayavadi element in his poetry although he wrote in other genres as well.

This period of Neo-romanticism, represents the adolescence of Hindi Poetry. It is marked by beauty of expression and flow of intense emotion. The four representative poets of this era represent the best in Hindi Poetry. A unique feature of this period is the emotional (and sometimes active) attachment of poets with national freedom struggle, their effort to understand and imbibe the vast spirit of a magnificent ancient culture and their towering genius which grossly overshadowed all the literary &#x27;talked abouts&#x27; of next seven decades.

Other important genres of &quot;Adhunik Sahitya&quot; (Modernism) are: Prayogvad (Experimentalism) of Ajneya and the &quot;Tar Saptak&quot; poets, also known as &quot;Nayi Kavita&quot; (New Poetry) and &quot;Nayi Kahani&quot; (New Story) of Nirmal Verma and others; followed by Pragativad (Progressivism) of Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh and other authors.

====Nakenwad====
Among the numerous schools of poetry which sprang up in the 1950s was &quot;Nakenwad&quot;, a school deriving its nomenclature from the first letters of the names of its three pioneers – Nalin Vilochan Sharma, Kesari Kumar, and Naresh Mehta, all poets of note in their own right. Apart from being poets, Vilochan and Kumar were also brilliant critics, with a wide perspective on literary history. Their critical attitude is marked by a synthesis or coordination of various disciplines of human knowledge – philosophy, history, art and culture, all pressed into the service of literary appraisal and analysis.

==Genres of Hindi literature==

===Poetry===
Hindi has a rich legacy of poetry. There are several genres of poetry based on Ras, Chhand and Alankar (e.g., Shringar, Karun, Veer, Hāsya, etc.). &quot;Hasya Kavita&quot; is humorous comic poetry in Hindi. It is particularly famous due to Hindi Kavi sammelans and TV shows. Bal kavita is children&#x27;s rhymes in Hindi.

Many attempts have been made to document Hindi poetry. Some of the most comprehensive online collections for Hindi poetry include &quot;Kavitakosh&quot; and &quot;Kavita&quot;.

The Hindi Kavita project, initiated by Manish Gupta in 2014, has contributed to the promotion and popularization of Hindi poetry through various platforms. Hindi Kavita has also made significant contributions to Indian film music. Several famous musical masterpieces have been witnessed.

===Vyangya (Hindi satire)===
The rhetoric of satire is called Vyangya in Hindi. Vyangya writings includes the essence of sarcasm and humour. Some of the better known writers in this genre are, Harishankar Parsai (Hindi: हरिशंकर परसाई) (22 August 1924 – 1995) was a Hindi writer. He was a noted satirist and humorist of modern Hindi literature and is known for his simple and direct style., Sri Lal Sukla, Suryakumar Pandey etc.

===Hindi travel literature===
Rahul Sankrityayan, Bhadant Anand Kausalyayan, Sachchidananda Hirananda Vatsyayan &#x27;Ajneya&#x27; and Baba Nagarjun were some of the great Indian writers who dedicated themselves entirely to the Hindi Travel Literature (&quot;Yatra Vritanta&quot;). Rahul Sankrityayan was one of the greatest travelled scholars of India, spending forty-five years of his life on travels away from his home. He is known as the (&quot;Father of Hindi Travel literature&quot;). Baba Nagarjun was a major Hindi and Maithili poet who has also penned a number of novels, short stories, literary biographies and travelogues, and was known as (&quot;Janakavi- the People&#x27;s Poet&quot;).

===Hindi playwriting===
The pioneer of Hindi theatre as well as playwrighting, Bhartendu Harishchandra wrote &quot;Satya Harishchandra&quot; (1875), &quot;Bharat Durdasha&quot; (1876) and &quot;Andher Nagari&quot; (1878), in the late 19th century, Jaishankar Prasad became the next big figure in Hindi playwriting with plays like &quot;Skanda Gupta&quot; (1928), &quot;Chandragupta&quot; (1931) and &quot;Dhruvswamini&quot; (1933).

As the Independence struggle was gathering steam playwrights broaching issues of nationalism and subversive ideas against the British, yet to dodge censorship they adapted themes from mythology, history and legend and used them as vehicle for political messages, a trend that continues to date, though now it was employed to bring out social, personal and psychological issues rather than clearly political, though street theatre broke this trend in coming decades in post-independence era, like IPTA-inspired, Naya Theatre of Habib Tanvir did in the 1950s–90s, Jana Natya Manch of Safdar Hashmi did in the 1970s–80s. Post-independence the emerging republic threw up new issues for playwrights to tackle and express, and Hindi playwriting showed greater brevity and symbolism, but it was not as prolific as in case with Hindi poetry or fiction. Yet we have playwrights like Jagdish Chandra Mathur (&quot;Konark&quot;) and Upendranath Ashk (&quot;Anjo Didi&quot;), who displayed a steadily evolving understanding of stagecraft. These were followed another generation of pioneers in Hindi playwrighting, Mohan Rakesh, who started with &quot;Ashadh Ka Ek Din&quot; (1958), &quot;Adhe Adhure&quot; and &quot;Lehron Ke Rajhans&quot;, Dharamvir Bharati, who wrote &quot;Andha Yug&quot;, and other playwrights like Surendra Verma, and Bhisham Sahni.

===Hindi essay-writing===
Kuber Nath Rai is one of the writers who dedicated themselves entirely to the form of essay-writing. His collections of essays &quot;Gandha Madan&quot;, &quot;Priya neel-kanti&quot;, &quot;Ras Aakhetak&quot;, &quot;Vishad Yog&quot;, &quot;Nishad Bansuri&quot;, &quot;Parna mukut&quot; have enormously enriched the form of essay.
A scholar of Indian culture and western literature, he was proud of Indian heritage. His love for natural beauty and Indian folk literatures and preference for agricultural society over the age of machines, his romantic outlook, aesthetic sensibility, his keen eye on contemporary reality and classical style place him very high among contemporary essayists in Hindi.

<doc id="296501" wikidata="Q5639401" url="?curid=296501" title="Hainault, London">
<text>Hainault (, ) is a large suburban area of Ilford in East London, England, in the London Borough of Redbridge, northeast of Charing Cross. Most of the housing in Hainault was built by the London County Council between 1947 and 1953. Originally spanning the parishes of Chigwell, Dagenham, and Ilford, in 1965 the estate was combined in a single London borough and became part of Greater London. 

It is adjacent to the Metropolitan Green Belt, bordered on the east by Hainault Forest Country Park and to the north by open land and the boundary with the Epping Forest District of Essex. The area is served by London Underground&#x27;s Central Line.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name Hainault was recorded as &#x27;Henehout&#x27; in 1221 and &#x27;Hyneholt&#x27; in 1239. It is Old English and means &#x27;wood belonging to a religious community&#x27;, referring to the ownership of Hainault Forest by Barking Abbey. The spelling was altered from the 17th century to its modern form owing to an imagined but false connection to Philippa of Hainault, the wife of Edward III.

===Development===
The area was mainly forested. It was owned by the nuns of Barking Abbey and formed part of the Forest of Essex. The area&#x27;s timber was predominantly used for building ships and houses. A decline in demand for timber, and a greater demand for food, led in 1851 to an Act of Parliament authorising the deforestation of much of Hainault Forest. Within six weeks 3,000 acres of woodland was cleared.

Urban development began after August 1856, when the Great Eastern Railway built a line between Stratford and Loughton. In 1903, from the line at Woodford Junction, a loop line to Ilford was opened. Hainault was one of the stations on that line.

Although it had been hoped that housing development would follow from the building of the railway, it took several decades. Hainault station was closed from 1908, five years after opening; development began in the late 1920s, and the station was reopened in 1930. As a result of the London Passenger Transport Board New Works Programme 1935–40 (not completed until 1948) the line was taken over from the LNER and converted for use by London Underground trains.

Because of the lack of available land in the County of London, the London County Council (LCC) was permitted to build housing and act as landlord outside of its territory. It purchased land in Chigwell, Dagenham, and Ilford in 1943. Building of the Hainault Estate commenced after the Second World War from 1947 to 1953. The development of 2,779 houses was in the style known as a &#x27;cottage estate&#x27; with the names of the roads relating to the history of Hainault Forest.

===Local government===
After the development of the Hainault Estate, the area was within three local government districts. Most of Hainault was split between the Chigwell Urban District and the Municipal Borough of Ilford, with a small part to the east within the Municipal Borough of Dagenham. The population of the Chigwell part of the estate was 7,071 in 1961.

The whole area formed part of the review area of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London. It was recommended by the commission that the three districts should become part of Greater London. During the passage of the London Government Act 1963, Chigwell became excluded from the new administrative area, which would have led to the estate being split by a county boundary. Instead, the opportunity was taken to unite the estate in a single London Borough of Redbridge, by combining the of the estate in Chigwell with the northern section of Dagenham and the whole of the boroughs of Ilford and Wanstead and Woodford.

==Government==
Three councillors are elected to represent the Hainault ward on Redbridge London Borough Council.

==Geography==
For postal addresses, it is split between the Chigwell and Ilford post towns in the IG postcode area. It is within the London 020 telephone area code, with the Hainault telephone exchange located just outside the Greater London boundary in Grange Hill.

Nearest places are Goodmayes, Chigwell, Collier Row, Barkingside and Chadwell Heath.

==Demographics==
The largest ethnic group in the Hainault ward of Redbridge in the 2011 census was White British, at 60.7% of the population. This was followed by Other White at 8.4% of the population and Black African at 5.7%.

55.9% of the population identified as Christians, with 8.6% of the population identifying as Muslim and 7% not stating a religion.

==Transport==
The nearest London Underground stations are Hainault and Grange Hill on the Central line.
The area is directly served by London bus routes 150, 247, 362, 462, and N8.

==Sport==
Hainault Athletic Football Club play in the Essex Sunday Combination League and have two teams of players.

Manford Way FC was formed in 1946 (known during the first year as Chigwell Labour Club). They played on a field opposite Grange Crescent, near Grange Hill Station, now houses; the club currently play in the Essex Olympian League. Manford Way is the main road that runs through the Hainault Estate.
