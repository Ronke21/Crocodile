<text>Francine Joy Drescher (born September 30, 1957) is an American actress and trade unionist. She is currently serving as the national president of the Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA). She played Fran Fine in the television sitcom &quot;The Nanny&quot; (1993–1999), which she created and produced with her then-husband Peter Marc Jacobson.

Drescher made her screen debut with a small role in the 1977 film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; and later appeared in &quot;American Hot Wax&quot; (1978) and Wes Craven&#x27;s horror film &quot;Stranger in Our House&quot; (1978). In the 1980s, she worked as a comedic actress in the films &quot;Gorp&quot; (1980), &quot;The Hollywood Knights&quot; (1980), &quot;Doctor Detroit&quot; (1983), &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; (1984), and &quot;UHF&quot; (1989), and made guest appearances on several television series. 

In 1993, she achieved wider fame as Fran Fine in her own sitcom vehicle &quot;The Nanny&quot;, for which she was nominated for two Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress in a Comedy Television Series during the show&#x27;s run. In the 2000s, Drescher starred in the sitcoms &quot;Living with Fran&quot; and &quot;Happily Divorced&quot;. From 2012 to 2022, she starred in the animated &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; film series. In 2014, Drescher made her Broadway debut in &quot;Cinderella&quot; as stepmother Madame. In 2020, she starred in the NBC sitcom &quot;Indebted&quot;.

The national members of trade union SAG-AFTRA, representing actors and other media professionals, elected Drescher as president, and she took office on October 15, 2021. Drescher led the union during the five-month actors&#x27; strike that began on July 14, 2023, partially overlapping with the writers&#x27; strike that had begun in May of that year.

==Early life and education==
Francine Joy Drescher was born on September 30, 1957, in Queens, a borough of New York City, the younger daughter of Sylvia Drescher (born 1934), a bridal consultant, and Morty Drescher (1929-2024), a naval systems analyst. Her family is Jewish, from Southeast and Central Europe. Her maternal great-grandmother Yetta was born in Focșani, Romania, and emigrated to the United States, while her father&#x27;s family came from Poland. She has an older sister, Nadine. Drescher was a first runner-up for &quot;Miss New York Teenager&quot; in 1973. 

She attended Flushing&#x27;s Parsons Junior High School, which later dissolved, and then Hillcrest High School in Jamaica, Queens. There she met her future husband, Peter Marc Jacobson, whom she married in 1978, at age 21. They divorced in 1999. Drescher graduated from Hillcrest High School in 1975; one of her classmates was comedian Ray Romano. Drescher&#x27;s character Fran Fine from &quot;The Nanny&quot; and Romano&#x27;s character Ray Barone from &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; met at a 20th high school reunion on an episode of &quot;The Nanny&quot;. Drescher and Jacobson attended Queens College, City University of New York, but dropped out in their first year because &quot;all the acting classes were filled.&quot; They then enrolled in cosmetology school.

==Career==

===Early career===
Drescher&#x27;s first break was a small role as dancer Connie in the movie &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977), in which she delivered the line &quot;So, are you as good in bed as you are on the dance floor?&quot; to John Travolta&#x27;s character. A year later, she began to gain attention in films such as &quot;American Hot Wax&quot; (1978) and &quot;Summer of Fear&quot; (1978). She also took on a rare dramatic role in the 1981 Miloš Forman film &quot;Ragtime&quot;. During the 1980s, Drescher found success as a character actress with roles in films such as &quot;Gorp&quot; (1980), &quot;The Hollywood Knights&quot; (1980), &quot;Doctor Detroit&quot; (1983), &quot;The Big Picture&quot; (1989), &quot;UHF&quot; (1989), &quot;Cadillac Man&quot; (1990), and memorably in &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; (1984) as publicist Bobbi Flekman. She also made an appearance in a second-season episode of &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; in 1985 as an interior decorator. She also had an appearance on &quot;Night Court&quot; as a woman with dissociative identity disorder who flips from a prude to a sexually minded woman and ends up in a hotel with Assistant District Attorney Dan Fielding. In 1990, Drescher appeared on &quot;ALF&quot; as Roxanne, the wife of grown-up Brian, who had no clue she was a mob boss, in the episode &quot;Future&#x27;s So Bright I Gotta Wear Shades&quot;. In 1991, Drescher co-starred on the short-lived CBS sitcom &quot;Princesses&quot;. In the early-to-mid 1990s, she voiced &quot;Peggy&quot; from &quot;The P Pals&quot; on PBS (the woman with the flower on her hat).

===&quot;The Nanny&quot; and film roles===

Drescher and Jacobson created their own television show, &quot;The Nanny&quot;, in 1993. The show aired on CBS from 1993 to 1999, and Drescher became an instant star. In this sitcom, she played a woman named Fran Fine who casually became the nanny of Margaret (&quot;Maggie&quot;) (played by Nicholle Tom), Brighton (&quot;B&quot;) (played by Benjamin Salisbury), and Grace (&quot;Gracie&quot;) Sheffield (played by Madeline Zima); with her wit and her charm, she endeared herself to their widower father: stuffy, composed, proper British gentleman and Broadway producer Maxwell Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessy). She reprised her &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; character of Bobbi Flekman, a look-alike for her Fran Fine character, in season 5, episode 3, of &quot;The Nanny&quot;. Drescher appeared in &quot;Jack&quot; (1996), directed by Francis Ford Coppola, &quot;The Beautician and the Beast&quot; (1997) (for which she was also executive producer) and &quot;Picking Up the Pieces&quot; (2000) co-starring Woody Allen. She was also the voice of &quot;Pearl&quot; in &quot;Shark Bait&quot; (2006).

===Return to television===
In the 2000s, Drescher made a return to television both with leading and guest roles. In 2003, Drescher appeared in episodes of the short-lived sitcom &quot;Good Morning, Miami&quot; as Roberta Diaz. In 2005, she returned with the sitcom &quot;Living with Fran&quot;, in which she played Fran Reeves, a middle-aged mother of two living with Riley Martin (Ryan McPartlin), a man half her age and not much older than her son. Former &quot;Nanny&quot; costar Charles Shaughnessy appeared as her philandering ex-husband, Ted. &quot;Living with Fran&quot; was cancelled on May 17, 2006, after two seasons.

In 2006, Drescher guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;; the episode, &quot;The War at Home&quot;, aired on US television on November 14, 2006. She also appeared in an episode of &quot;Entourage&quot; and, in the same year, gave her voice to the role of a female golem in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror XVII&quot;. In 2007, Drescher appeared in the US version of the Australian improvisational comedy series &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;. In 2008, Drescher announced that she was developing a new sitcom entitled &quot;The New Thirty&quot;, also starring Rosie O&#x27;Donnell. A series about two old high school friends coping with midlife crises, Drescher described the premature plot of the show as &quot;kind of &quot;Sex and the City&quot; but we ain&#x27;t getting any! It&#x27;ll probably be more like &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;.&quot; It was never produced.

In 2010, Drescher returned to television with her own daytime talk show, &quot;The Fran Drescher Tawk Show&quot;. While the program debuted to strong ratings, it ended its three-week test run to moderate success, resulting in its shelving. The following year, the sitcom &quot;Happily Divorced&quot;, created by Drescher and her ex-husband, Peter Marc Jacobson, was picked up by TV Land for a ten-episode order. It premiered there June 15, 2011. The show was renewed in July 2011 for a second season of 12 episodes, which aired in spring 2012. On May 1, 2012, TV Land extended the second season and picked up 12 additional episodes, taking the second season total to 24. The back-order of season two debuted later in 2012. &quot;Happily Divorced&quot; was cancelled in August 2013.

To promote &quot;Happily Divorced&quot;, Drescher performed the weddings of three gay couples in New York City using the minister&#x27;s license she received from the Universal Life Church. Drescher hand-picked the three couples, all of whom were entrants into &quot;Fran Drescher&#x27;s &#x27;Love Is Love&#x27; Gay Marriage Contest&quot; on Facebook, based on the stories the couples submitted about how they met, why their relationship illustrated that &quot;love is love&quot; and why they wanted to be married by her.

===Broadway===
Drescher made her Broadway debut on February 4, 2014, in the revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot;. She replaced Harriet Harris as stepmother Madame for a 10-week engagement. She reprised the role during the North American tour&#x27;s engagement in Los Angeles, lasting from March through April 2015. Drescher&#x27;s previous stage performances include an off-Broadway production of Nora Ephron&#x27;s &quot;Love, Loss, and What I Wore&quot;, and &quot;Camelot&quot; at the Lincoln Center with the New York Philharmonic. On January 8, 2020, it was announced that Drescher and Jacobson were writing the book for a musical adaptation of &quot;The Nanny&quot;. Rachel Bloom and Adam Schlesinger of &quot;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend&quot; were brought on to compose the songs prior to Schlesinger&#x27;s death in April 2020, while Marc Bruni (&quot;&quot;) was slated to direct. Drescher will not portray the title role, as she joked that if she did &quot;We&#x27;d have to change the title to &quot;The Granny&quot;.&quot;

=== Trade union leader ===
In 2021, Drescher began her campaign to become president of the
&quot;Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists&quot; (SAG-AFTRA) union, citing both her entertainment and political background &quot;(see below)&quot;. Her candidacy came from the &quot;Unite for Strength&quot; faction, and she ran against actor Matthew Modine. On September 2, 2021, SAG-AFTRA announced that Drescher had won the election. On July 13, 2023, after SAG-AFTRA members overwhelmingly voted to authorize a strike action a week prior, Drescher announced the SAG-AFTRA strike was to begin at midnight the following day, running alongside the concurrent &quot;Writers Guild of America&quot; strike (WGA strike) that began just over two months prior. The strike ended with a tentative deal between the union and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers which was approved by the SAG-AFTRA board. On July 25, 2024, ten months after SAG-AFTRA members voted overwhemingly to authorize another strike against the video game industry, Drescher stated that SAG-AFTRA would begin a strike against major video game publishers, with the strike then going into effect the following day at 12:01 am.

==Personal life==
Fran Drescher met Peter Marc Jacobson when she was 15. The two were high school sweethearts and married at 21. In January 1985, two armed men broke into Drescher and Jacobson&#x27;s Los Angeles apartment. While one ransacked their home, Drescher and a female friend were raped by the other robber at gunpoint. Jacobson was also physically attacked, tied up, and forced to witness the entire ordeal. It took Drescher many years to recover, and it took her even longer to tell her story to the press. She was paraphrased as saying in an interview with Larry King that although it was a traumatic experience, she found ways to turn it into something positive. In her book &quot;Cancer Schmancer&quot;, the actress writes: &quot;My whole life has been about changing negatives into positives.&quot; According to Drescher, her rapist, who was on parole at the time of the crime, was returned to prison and given two life sentences.

After separating in 1996, Drescher and Jacobson divorced in 1999. They had no children. Drescher has worked to support LGBT rights issues after her former husband came out. Drescher has stated that the primary reason for the divorce was her need to change directions in life. Drescher and Jacobson remain friends and business partners. She has stated that &quot;we choose to be in each other&#x27;s lives in any capacity. Our love is unique, rare, and unconditional, unless he&#x27;s being annoying.&quot; On September 7, 2014, Drescher and Shiva Ayyadurai participated in a ceremony at Drescher&#x27;s beach house. Both tweeted that they had married and the event was widely reported as such. Ayyadurai later said it was not &quot;a formal wedding or marriage,&quot; but a celebration of their &quot;friendship in a spiritual ceremony with close friends and her family.&quot; The couple separated two years later. In March 2024, Drescher&#x27;s father died at the age of 94.

===Cancer===

After two years of symptoms and misdiagnoses by eight doctors, Drescher was admitted to Los Angeles&#x27;s Cedars Sinai Hospital on June 21, 2000, after doctors diagnosed her with uterine cancer. She had to undergo an immediate radical hysterectomy to treat the disease. Drescher was declared cancer-free and no post-operative treatment was ordered. Drescher wrote about her experiences in her second book, &quot;Cancer Schmancer&quot;. Her purpose for this book was to raise consciousness for people &quot;to become more aware of the early warning signs of cancer, and to empower themselves&quot;. Drescher says, &quot;I was going to learn what I needed to learn, ask questions, become partners with my doctor instead of having some kind of parent/child relationship.&quot;

===Cancer Schmancer Movement===
On June 21, 2007, the seventh anniversary of her operation, Drescher launched the Cancer Schmancer Movement, a non-profit organization dedicated to ensuring that all women&#x27;s cancers be diagnosed while in Stage 1, the most curable stage. She celebrated her tenth year of wellness on June 21, 2010. Drescher says:
She says her goal is to live in a time when women&#x27;s mortality rates drop as their healthcare improves and early cancer detection increases. Her efforts as an outspoken healthcare advocate in Washington, D.C. helped get unanimous passage for (also known as Johanna&#x27;s Law) and she is acknowledged in the Congressional Record.

===Politics===

In September 2008, Drescher, a Democrat, was appointed as a U.S. diplomat by George W. Bush administration&#x27;s Assistant Secretary of State Goli Ameri. Her official title was Public Diplomacy Envoy for Women&#x27;s Health Issues. In traveling throughout the world, she supported U.S. public diplomacy efforts, including working with health organizations and women&#x27;s groups to raise awareness of women&#x27;s health issues, cancer awareness and detection, and patient empowerment and advocacy. Her first trip was in late September and included stops in Serbia, Hungary, as well as her ancestral Romania and Poland.

In 2008, Drescher supported Senator Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. She attended a Super Democrat rally for Clinton. Drescher said that she had been considering a run for the United States Senate in 2008 to succeed Hillary Clinton, but ultimately decided against it. She endorsed Barack Obama for re-election in 2012. In 2017, she said in an interview she was explicitly anti-capitalist and was happy to see the Green Party gaining some traction. In 2018, Drescher attended a fundraiser gala for Friends of the Israeli Defense Forces (FIDF), which raised $60 million. Drescher received the COVID-19 vaccine but opposes vaccine mandates.

===Charity===
In April 2014, Drescher presented at Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS Easter Bonnet Competition with Bryan Cranston, Idina Menzel and Denzel Washington, after raising donations at her Broadway show &quot;Cinderella&quot;. Drescher became an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church Monastery so that she could legally officiate LGBT wedding ceremonies.

==Awards==

Drescher has been the recipient of the John Wayne Institute&#x27;s Woman of Achievement Award, the Gilda Award, the City of Hope Woman of the Year Award, the Hebrew University Humanitarian Award, and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine&#x27;s Spirit of Achievement Award. In 2006, she was honored with the City of Hope Spirit of Life Award, which was presented to her by Senator Hillary Clinton. On April 10, 2010, she was guest of honor at the &quot;Dancer against Cancer&quot; charity ball held at the Imperial Palace, Vienna, Austria, where she received the first &quot;My Aid Award&quot; for her achievements in support of cancer prevention and rehabilitation. In 2021, Drescher was awarded the LifeSaver Award by ELEM/Youth in Distress.

<doc id="302927" wikidata="Q3746560" url="?curid=302927" title="Phlegm">
<text>Phlegm (; , &quot;phlégma&quot;, &quot;inflammation&quot;, &quot;humour caused by heat&quot;) is mucus produced by the respiratory system, excluding that produced by the throat nasal passages. It often refers to respiratory mucus expelled by coughing, otherwise known as sputum. Phlegm, and mucus as a whole, is in essence a water-based gel consisting of glycoproteins, immunoglobulins, lipids and other substances. Its composition varies depending on climate, genetics, and state of the immune system. Its color can vary from transparent to pale or dark yellow and green, from light to dark brown, and even to dark grey depending on the contents. The body naturally produces about 1 quart (about 1 litre) of phlegm every day to capture and clear in the air and bacteria from the nose and throat.

==Distinction between mucus and phlegm==
Contrary to popular misconception and misuse, mucus and phlegm are not always the same.

===Mucus===
Mucus is a normal protective layering around the airway, eye, nasal turbinate, and urogenital tract. Mucus is an adhesive viscoelastic gel produced in the airway by submucosal glands and goblet cells and is principally water. It also contains high-molecular weight mucous glycoproteins that form linear polymers. 

===Phlegm===
Phlegm is more related to disease than mucus, and can be troublesome for the individual to excrete from the body. Phlegm is a thick secretion in the airway during disease and inflammation. Phlegm usually contains mucus with virus, bacteria, other debris, and sloughed-off inflammatory cells. Once phlegm has been expectorated by a cough, it becomes sputum.

==Excessive phlegm creation==
There are multiple factors that can contribute to an excess of phlegm in the throat or larynx.

*Vocal abuse: Vocal abuse is the misuse or overuse of the voice in an unhealthy fashion such as clearing the throat, yelling, screaming, talking loudly, or singing incorrectly.
**Clearing the throat: Clearing the throat removes or loosens phlegm but the vocal cords hit together causing inflammation and therefore more phlegm.
**Yelling/screaming: Yelling and screaming both cause the vocal cords to hit against each other causing inflammation and phlegm.
**Nodules: Excessive yelling, screaming, and incorrect singing as well as other vocal abusive habits can cause vocal fold nodules.
*Smoking: Smoke is hot, dry, polluted air which dries out the vocal cords. With each breath in of smoke, the larynx is polluted with toxins that inhibit it from rehydrating for about 3 hours. The vocal cords need a fair amount of lubrication and swell from inflammation when they do not have enough of it. When the vocal folds swell and are inflamed, phlegm is often created to attempt to ease the dryness.
*Illness: During illness like the flu, cold, and pneumonia, phlegm becomes more excessive as an attempt to get rid of the bacteria or viral particles within the body. A major illness associated with excess phlegm is acute bronchitis. A major symptom of acute bronchitis is an excess amount of phlegm and is usually caused by a viral infection, and only bacterial infections, which are rare, are to be treated with an antibiotic.
*Hay fever, asthma: In hay fever and asthma, inner lining in bronchioles become inflamed and create an excess amount of phlegm that can clog up air pathways.
*Air pollution: In studies of children, air pollutants have been found to increase phlegm by drying out and irritating parts of the throat.

== Removing phlegm ==
Phlegm naturally drains down into the back of the throat and can be swallowed without imposing health risks. Once in the stomach, the acids and digestive system will remove the phlegm and get rid of the germs in it. In some cultures, swallowing phlegm is considered a social taboo, being described as disgusting or unhygienic. One Igbo adage, for example, uses the swallowing of phlegm as a metaphor for wrongdoing. Also, due to the social image of spitting (the alternative of swallowing) in some communities, females were shown to be more likely to swallow phlegm and less likely to report experiencing it.

The alternative to swallowing would be throat-clearing. To do this, the mouth should be closed and air should be inhaled hard into the nose. Inhaling forcefully through the nose will pull excess phlegm and nasal mucus down into the throat, where muscles in the throat and tongue can prepare to eject it. Once this is done, a U-shape should be formed with the tongue, while simultaneously forcing air and saliva forward with the muscles at the back of the throat. At this point, the phlegm will be in the mouth and is now ready to be spat out as sputum.

== Colors of phlegm ==
Phlegm can exist in different colors. The color could provide important clues about a person&#x27;s health.

* Yellow or green: Indicates an infection often by a virus or bacteria. The color is caused by an enzyme produced by the white blood cells combating the infection.
* Clear: Indicates allergies. Mucous membranes produce histamines and make more phlegm.
* Red: Indicates dry air. A nasal spray can be used to alleviate symptoms of a dry nose and throat. It can also occur due to blood (such as if the person had or has a bleeding nose, or a lung malignancy).

==Illnesses related to phlegm==

Phlegm may be a carrier of larvae of intestinal parasites (see hookworm). Bloody sputum can be a symptom of serious disease (such as tuberculosis), but can also be a relatively benign symptom of a minor disease (such as bronchitis). In the latter case, the sputum is normally lightly streaked with blood. Coughing up any significant quantity of blood is always a serious medical condition, and any person who experiences this should seek medical attention.

Apophlegmatisms, in pre-modern medicine, were medications chewed in order to draw away phlegm and humours.

==History==
===Phlegm and humourism===
 
Humourism is an ancient theory that the human body is filled with four basic substances, called the &quot;four humours&quot;, which are held in balance when a person is healthy. It is closely related to the ancient theory of the four elements and states that all diseases and disabilities result from an excess or deficit in black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood. Hippocrates, an ancient Greek medical doctor, is credited for this theory, about 400 BC. It influenced medical thinking for more than 2,000 years, until finally discredited in the 1800s.

Phlegm was thought to be associated with apathetic behaviour; this old belief is preserved in the word &quot;phlegmatic&quot;. This adjective always refers to behaviour, and is pronounced differently, giving full weight to the &quot;g&quot;: not /ˈflɛmatɪk/ but /flɛgˈmatɪk/.

To have &quot;phlegm&quot; traditionally meant to have stamina and to be unswayed by emotion. In his 1889 farewell speech at the University of Pennsylvania, Sir William Osler discussed the imperturbability required of physicians. &quot;&#x27;Imperturbability means coolness and presence of mind under all circumstances, calmness amid storm, clearness of judgment in moments of grave peril, immobility, impassiveness, or, to use an old and expressive word, phlegm.&quot;&quot;

The phlegm of Humourism is far from the same thing as phlegm as it is defined today. Nobel laureate Charles Richet MD, when describing humorism&#x27;s &quot;phlegm or pituitary secretion&quot; in 1910 asked rhetorically, &quot;this strange liquid, which is the cause of tumours, of chlorosis, of rheumatism, and cacochymia - where is it? Who will ever see it? Who has ever seen it? What can we say of this fanciful classification of humours into four groups, of which two are absolutely imaginary?&quot;

<text>Thomas Lodge (September 1625) was an English writer and medical practitioner whose life spanned the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Thomas Lodge was born about 1557 in West Ham, the second son of Sir Thomas Lodge, Lord Mayor of London, by his third wife Anne (1528–1579), daughter of Henry Luddington (died 1531), a London grocer. 
The year before he was born his father had transferred the ownership the manors of Hawkstone and Soulton to Sir Rowland Hill, publisher of the Geneva Bible and a fellow Lord Mayor. The Lodge family continued some form of association with those manors, and it has been suggested that this was part of the inspiration of Lodge junior&#x27;s literally output.

He was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School and Trinity College, Oxford; taking his BA in 1577 and MA in 1581. In 1578 he entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, where, as in the other Inns of Court, a love of letters and a crop of debts were common.

=== Early literary work ===
Lodge, disregarding the wishes of his family, took up literature. When the penitent Stephen Gosson had published his &quot;Schoole of Abuse&quot; in 1579, Lodge responded with &quot;Defence of Poetry, Music and Stage Plays&quot; (1579 or 1580), which shows a certain restraint, though both forceful and learned. The pamphlet was banned, but appears to have been circulated privately. It was answered by Gosson in his &quot;Playes Confuted in Five Actions&quot;; and Lodge retorted with his &quot;Alarum Against Usurers&quot; (1584)—a &quot;tract for the times&quot; which may have resulted from personal experience. In the same year he produced the first tale written by him on his own account in prose and verse, &quot;The Delectable History of Forbonius and Prisceria&quot;, both published and reprinted with the &quot;Alarum&quot;.

From 1587 onwards he seems to have made a series of attempts at play writing, though most of those attributed to him are mainly conjectural. He probably never became an actor, and John Payne Collier&#x27;s conclusion to that effect rested on the two assumptions that the &quot;Lodge&quot; of Philip Henslowe&#x27;s manuscript was a player and that his name was Thomas, neither of which is supported by the text.

Having been to sea with Captain Clarke in his expedition to Terceira and the Canaries, Lodge in 1591 made a voyage with Thomas Cavendish to Brazil and the Straits of Magellan, returning home by 1593. 

=== Writing Shakespeare source material ===

During the Canaries expedition (circa 1586), to beguile the tedium of his voyage, he composed his prose tale of &quot;Rosalynde: Euphues Golden Legacy, Found After His Death In His Cell At Silexedra&quot;, (1590). This subsequently furnished the story of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot;. 

The novel, which in its turn owes some, though no very considerable, debt to the medieval &quot;Tale of Gamelyn&quot; (unwarrantably appended to the fragmentary Cookes Tale in certain manuscripts of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s works), is written in the euphuistic manner, but decidedly attractive both by its plot and by the situations arising from it. It has been frequently reprinted. 

The name Euphues is taken from a work by John Lyly, itself taken from Roger Ascham&#x27;s &quot;The Scholemaster&quot;, which describes Euphues as a type of student who is: apte by goodnes of witte, and appliable by readines of will, to learning, hauving all other qualities of the mind and partes of the bodie, that must an other day serue learning, not trobled, mangled, and halfed, but sounde, whole, full &amp; hable to do their office 

==== Later works and later life ====
Before starting on his second expedition he had published a historical romance, &quot;The History of Robert, Second Duke of Normandy, surnamed Robert the Devil&quot;; and he left behind him for publication &quot;Catharos Diogenes in his Singularity&quot;, a discourse on the immorality of Athens (London). Both appeared in 1591. Another romance in the manner of Lyly, &quot;Euphues Shadow, the Battaile of the Sences&quot; (1592), appeared while Lodge was still on his travels.

In the latter part of his life—possibly about 1596, when he published his &quot;Wits Miserie and the World&#x27;s Madnesse&quot;, which is dated from Low Leyton in Essex, and the religious tract &quot;Prosopopeia&quot; (if, as seems probable, it was his), in which he repents him of his &quot;lewd lines&quot; of other days—he became a Catholic and engaged in the practice of medicine, for which Wood says he qualified himself by a degree at Avignon in 1600. Two years afterwards he received the degree of M.D. from Oxford University.

Early in 1606 he seems to have left England, to escape the persecution then directed against the Catholics; and a letter from him dated 1610 thanks the English ambassador in Paris for enabling him to return in safety. He was abroad on urgent private affairs of one kind and another in 1616. From this time to his death nothing further concerning him remains to be noted.

Lodge while practising medicine in London lived first in Warwick Lane, afterwards in Lambert Hill, and finally in Old Fish Street in the parish of St Mary Magdalen. He died in Old Fish Street in 1625, apparently in the Roman Catholic communion (see below). He may have been buried in St Mary Magdalen Old Fish Street, demolished in 1893, but documentary evidence is lacking.

==Dramatic works==

Lodge&#x27;s known dramatic work is small in quantity. In conjunction with Robert Greene he, probably in 1590, produced in a popular vein the odd but far from feeble play, &quot;A Looking Glass for London and England&quot; (published 1594). He had already written &quot;The Wounds of Civil War&quot; (produced perhaps as early as 1587, and published in 1594), a good second-rate piece in the half-chronicle fashion of its age. Darren Freebury-Jones has advanced arguments that Lodge co-wrote &quot;Selimus&quot; with Greene.

Fleay saw grounds for assigning to Lodge &quot;Mucedorus and Amadine&quot;, played by the Queen&#x27;s Men about 1588, a share with Robert Greene in &quot;George a Greene, the Pinner of Wakefield&quot;, and in Shakespeare&#x27;s 2nd part of &quot;Henry VI&quot;; he also regards him as at least part-author of &quot;The True Chronicle of King Leir and his three Daughters&quot; (1594); and &quot;The Troublesome Raigne of John, King of England&quot; (c. 1588); in the case of two other plays he allowed the assignation to Lodge to be purely conjectural.

That Lodge is the &quot;Young Juvenal&quot; of Greene&#x27;s &quot;Groats-Worth of Wit&quot; is no longer a generally accepted hypothesis.

==Poetry and prose==
His second historical romance, the &quot;Life and Death of William Longbeard&quot; (1593), was more successful than the first. Lodge also brought back with him from the new world &quot;A Margarite of America&quot; (published 1596), a romance of the same description interspersed with many lyrics. Already in 1589 Lodge had given to the world a volume of poems bearing the title of the chief among them, &quot;Scillaes Metamorphosis, Enterlaced with the Unfortunate Love of Glaucus&quot;, more briefly known as &quot;Glaucus and Scilla&quot;. To this tale Shakespeare was possibly indebted for the idea of &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;. In a lost work, the &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Kalendar&quot;, he must in one way or another have recounted his sea adventures.

If Lodge, as has been supposed, was the Alcon in &quot;Colin Clout&#x27;s Come Home Again&quot;, it may have been the influence of Edmund Spenser which led to the composition of &quot;Phillis&quot;, a volume of sonnets, in which the voice of nature seems only now and then to become audible, published with the narrative poem &quot;The Complaynte of Elsired&quot; in 1593. &quot;A Fig for Momus&quot;, on the strength of which he has been called the earliest English satirist, and which contains eclogues addressed to Samuel Daniel and others, an epistle addressed to Michael Drayton, and other pieces, appeared in 1595.

==Academic works==
After Lodge received his M.D. from Oxford University, his works from then on take on a more serious note, comprising translations of Josephus (1602), of Seneca (1614), a &quot;Learned Summary of Du Bartas&#x27;s Divine Sepmaine&quot; (1625 and 1637). He also wrote medical literature including the &quot;Treatise of the Plague&quot; (1603), &quot;The poore Mans Talentt&quot; (c. 1623)&quot;,&quot; and a popular manual, which remained unpublished, on &quot;Domestic Medicine&quot;.

==Family==
Lodge seems to have married his first wife Joan in or before 1583, when, &quot;impressed with the uncertainty of human life&quot;, he made a will. That his family viewed his conduct at the time with disfavour may be inferred from the absence of his name from his father&#x27;s will in 1583. Lodge and Joan had a daughter Mary. He married secondly Jane, widow of Solomon Aldred, at one time a Roman Catholic agent of Francis Walsingham in Rome.

<text>The Rheinische Zeitung (&quot;Rhenish Newspaper&quot;) was a 19th-century German newspaper, edited most famously by Karl Marx. The paper was launched in January 1842 and terminated by Prussian state censorship in March 1843. The paper was eventually succeeded by a daily newspaper launched by Marx on behalf of the Communist League in June 1848, called the &quot;Neue Rheinische Zeitung&quot; (&quot;New Rhenish Newspaper&quot;).

== Publication history ==

===Background===

The city of Cologne (Köln) has long been the most important urban center of the region of Germany known as Rhineland. During the decade of the 1830s a newspaper called the &quot;Kölnische Zeitung&quot; (&quot;Cologne Newspaper&quot;) emerged as the voice of the Catholic political opposition based in that city. The protestant Prussian government, based in Berlin, considered this newspaper and its 8,000 subscribers a thorn in its side, and looked favorably upon attempts by others to establish new newspapers to undercut the &quot;Kölnische Zeitung&#x27;s&quot; dominant position.

A series of papers had been launched in Cologne, each failing, with the powerful &quot;Kölnische Zeitung&quot; generally buying out its fledgling competitors. One of this series of hapless rivals was a newspaper launched in Cologne in December 1839 called the &quot;Rheinische Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; (&quot;Rhenish General Newspaper&quot;). The paper struggled for two years without successfully gaining a foothold and seemed headed for extinction. When it was evident that the newspaper was becoming bankrupt soon, George Jung and Moses Hess convinced some leading rich liberals of the Rhineland, like Camphausen, Mevissen and Oppenheim to establish a company to buy out the newspaper. The sub-heading was &quot;For politics, Commerce and Industry&#x27;. The shareholders initially chose Friedrich List as editor but were declined due to his health problems. Then the editorship was offered to Gustav Höfken, while Hess given the post of sub-editor.

At the eleventh hour a group of prominent Cologne citizens decided to raise fresh working capital and to attempt to reestablish the paper on a new basis. This new version of the old &quot;Rheinische Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; was to be known as the &quot;Rheinische Zeitung&quot; (&quot;Rhenish News&quot;).

===Establishment===

The &quot;Rheinische Zeitung&quot; was launched on 1 January 1842, with Moses Hess serving as an editor. The paper originally expressed a pro-government stance, but its political line soon shifted to better accord with popular sentiment among Rhinelanders, many of whom regarded the Prussian government in Berlin as an oppressive alien entity.

Although living in Bonn at the time of the paper&#x27;s launch, Karl Marx seems to have been aware of the project from its inception and he began contributing articles to its pages, which drew notice from among the paper&#x27;s readers. These articles would be the first of Marx&#x27;s writings (beside his doctoral dissertation) to be published for the public. Previously fixated upon questions of abstract philosophy, Marx was first introduced to practical journalism in the course of writing for the &quot;Rheinische Zeitung.&quot; It was during this period, too, that Marx first came into contact Moses Hess and with French socialist ideas.

In the pages of the &quot;Rheinische Zeitung&quot; Marx had criticized the failings of the Rhineland Diet, seated at Düsseldorf, charging it with implementing class-based legislation which negatively impacted the rights and prosperity of common citizens in favor of a privileged stratum of landowners. In long articles Marx was additionally critical of the Diet&#x27;s failings to advance the cause of freedom of the press, as well as its refusal to publish its own proceedings. Far from revolutionary at this juncture, Marx retained a faith that public debate in a free press would be sufficient to ameliorate the various evils facing society regardless of the Diet&#x27;s weakness.

The government was agitated by the &quot;Rheinische Zeitung&quot; but did not take the step of forcing its closure, hoping instead that the paper would die on its own. This seemed a reasonable assessment, as by the middle of August 1842 the paper&#x27;s subscriber list had dwindled to just 885. However, on 15 October 1842, Marx was appointed to the editorial board and the &quot;Rheinische Zeitung&quot; began an apparent rise from the ashes gaining nearly 1,000 subscribers over the course of the next month.

Marx analyzed the debate of the Rhineland Diet dealing with the alleged theft of wood by the peasantry—a topic which Marx later recalled &quot;provided the first occasion for occupying myself in the economic questions.&quot; Frederick Engels, who first established close personal relations with Karl Marx in 1844, later affirmed that it was Marx&#x27;s journalism at the &quot;Rheinische Zeitung&quot; which led him &quot;from pure politics to economic relationships and so to socialism.&quot;

===Suppression===

With the paper&#x27;s fortunes on the rise, the &quot;Rheinische Zeitung&quot; continued to draw the government&#x27;s ire, with the publication in January 1843 of a series of articles documenting the government&#x27;s refusal to take seriously the complaints of the local peasantry. A defiant tone of some published correspondence and growing sentiment for democracy among the populace further alienated the authorities. On 21 January 1843 the Cabinet, with the King in attendance, decided that the &quot;Rheinische Zeitung&quot; should be suppressed.

The intelligentsia of the Rhineland saw the suppression of the newspaper as a personal affront and a delegation was sent to Berlin in an attempt to forestall the paper&#x27;s final closure. Subscriptions had risen to more than 3,000—very few German papers of the day were larger and none more widely quoted. Moreover, thousands of citizens signed petitions calling for the publication&#x27;s continuation.

Regardless of the appeals of the citizenry on behalf of the paper, King Friedrich Wilhelm IV refused to grant an audience to hear a personal appeal and the mass of public petitions gathered were pointedly ignored.

In desperation shareholders in the paper demanded that the &quot;Rheinische Zeitung&quot; tone down its aggressive political line, a move which prompted Marx to submit his resignation as editor on 17 March 1843. The local censor was enthusiastic about this change in the newspaper&#x27;s staff, noting that a &quot;really moderate though insignificant man&quot; named Oppenheim had taken over the editorial chair and recommending that the decision to close the paper be reversed. The paper was shut down regardless on 31 March.

===Legacy===

In the view of historian David Fernbach, the suppression of the paper in March 1843 by the Prussian government shattered Marx&#x27;s belief that the country could traverse the road from monarchy to constitutional democracy without revolutionary struggle.

In the aftermath of the suppression of the original &quot;Rheinische Zeitung,&quot; Marx had left Germany altogether, landing in Paris where a new publishing proposal awaited him. Marx would spend the next five years in France, Belgium, and England, waiting for a suitable moment to make a return to his native Rhineland.

Marx would return to Cologne during the first half of April 1848, amidst the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states and immediately began to make preparations to establish a new—and more radical—newspaper. This publication, launched on June 1, would be known as the &quot;Neue Rheinische Zeitung&quot; (&quot;New Rhenish News&quot;).

<text>The Nanny is an American sitcom that originally aired on CBS from November 3, 1993, to June 23, 1999, starring Fran Drescher as Fran Fine, a Jewish from Flushing, Queens who becomes the nanny of three children from an Anglo-American upper-class family in New York City. The show was created and produced by Drescher and her then-husband Peter Marc Jacobson, taking much of its inspiration from Drescher&#x27;s personal life growing up, involving names and characteristics based on her relatives and friends. The sitcom has also spawned several foreign adaptations, loosely inspired by the original scripts. 

The show earned a Rose d&#x27;Or, and one Emmy Award, out of a total of twelve nominations; Drescher was twice nominated for a Golden Globe and an Emmy. The sitcom was the first new show delivered to CBS for the 1993 season and the highest-tested pilot at the network in years. The series was hugely successful internationally, especially in Australia, where it was one of the highest-rated programs of the decade. &quot;The Nanny&quot; has been called &quot;the &#x27;90s version of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;&quot; and &quot;well written and entertaining.&quot;

==Plot==
Fran Fine (Drescher) turns up on the New York City doorstep of British Broadway producer Mr. Maxwell Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessy) peddling cosmetics after being dumped, and subsequently fired, by her bridal-shop-owner ex-boyfriend. Reluctantly, Mr. Sheffield instead hires Fran to be the nanny of his three children, Maggie, Brighton, and Gracie. In spite of his initial misgivings, Fran turns out to be just what he and his family needed.

While Fran manages the children, acerbic British butler Niles (Daniel Davis) manages the household and watches all the events that unfold with Fran as the new nanny. Niles, recognizing Fran&#x27;s gift for bringing warmth back to the family (as Maxwell is a widower), does his best to undermine Maxwell&#x27;s business partner C.C. Babcock (Lauren Lane), who has her eye on the very available and desirable Mr. Sheffield. Niles is often seen making witty comments directed toward C.C., with her replying in a similarly witty fashion, in their ongoing game of one-upmanship.

As the series progresses, it becomes increasingly obvious that Mr. Sheffield is smitten with Fran, although he will not admit it, and Fran is clearly smitten with him. The show teases the viewers with their closeness, featuring many &quot;near-misses&quot; and moments of jealousy, as well as an engagement. In the later seasons, the two do finally marry and expand their family by having fraternal twins named Jonah and Eve. Later in the series, it is also clear that Niles and C.C.&#x27;s constant sharp barbs are their own bizarre form of flirtation and affection; after a few false-starts (including multiple impulsive and failed proposals from Niles), the pair marry in the same delivery room where Fran is giving birth to the twins, and subsequently discover they, too, are expecting a child.

==Episodes==

==Characters==
===Main characters===
* Francine Joy &quot;Fran&quot; Fine (later Sheffield) is the nasal-voiced, outgoing protagonist of the series. She starts off working for her boyfriend Danny Imperialli in a bridal shop but is dumped and fired not long after. Fran ends up meeting Maxwell Sheffield and his family while going door to door to sell cosmetics. She winds up as the nanny to Mr. Sheffield&#x27;s three children: Maggie, Brighton, and Gracie. Her character has an outgoing and humorous personality. As a result of her mother&#x27;s overbearing personality, Fran often feels the need to date and is compelled to get married as well. She is usually seen getting into trouble and having to solve those problems through using her street smarts.
* Maxwell Beverly &quot;Max&quot; Sheffield is the male protagonist who ends up hiring Fran to watch over his three children. He is a widowed Broadway producer, having lost his wife Sara four years before the start of the series. While he does have some success as a producer, he remains constantly in the shadow of his rival Andrew Lloyd Webber, who always seems to have the upper hand. He does not spend a lot of time with his children due to his busy schedule, hence the need for a nanny in the first place. Despite his mutual attraction to Fran, he tries to keep their relationship professional for fear of commitment. However, in season 5 episode 14, Maxwell tells Fran that he loves her and does not take it back, having done so earlier; the couple&#x27;s engagement follows, ending the romantic tension between them. Following several snafus, they are finally married in the season 5 finale.
* Niles is the loyal butler and chauffeur for the Sheffield family. He and Maxwell have known each other their whole lives. He bonds with Fran immediately, viewing her as the breath of fresh air that the Sheffield family needs. Niles is known as the household snoop as he is constantly seen listening in on conversations via intercoms, keyholes, and even in the very rooms where the conversations are taking place. He tends to manipulate events in Fran&#x27;s favor to undermine C.C., his nemesis. In spite of this, over time it becomes clear that Niles has himself fallen for C.C. and their contentious relationship is a cover for a mutual attraction.
* C.C. Babcock is the egocentric business partner of Maxwell Sheffield, with whom she has been working for almost 20 years. She clearly wants him as more than a business partner. Maxwell, however, appears oblivious to her feelings, and C.C.&#x27;s serious moves on him are thwarted by this, or by his longtime butler Niles. A running gag is that she cannot remember the names of Maxwell&#x27;s children, in spite of having known them their entire lives. From her first meeting with Fran, she accurately views the newly hired nanny as a threat and tries to undermine her. Fran is not C.C.&#x27;s only enemy in the Sheffield house, as she has an even more contentious relationship with Niles (who hates her just as much as she hates him). In spite of this, over time it becomes clear that C.C. has herself fallen for Niles and their continual barbs towards each other are covering for a mutual attraction. Throughout the series she is referred to only as “C.C.”, with her full name - Chastity Claire - revealed only in the last few minutes of the series finale.
* Margaret Isabella &quot;Maggie&quot; Sheffield (later Brolin) is the eldest child of Maxwell Sheffield. She is constantly seen bickering with her brother, Brighton, who views her as a nerd. Her relationship with her sister Gracie is generally much warmer. At the beginning of the series, Maggie is shy and awkward but, with Fran&#x27;s influence, she becomes a somewhat popular young woman. Upon meeting Fran, the two bond almost instantly, with Fran behaving like a friend or sister except on the rare occasions that Maggie needs to be disciplined. Near the end of the series, Maggie meets and marries an underwear model, Michael Brolin.
* Brighton Milhouse Sheffield is the middle child of the family and the only son of Maxwell Sheffield. Due to being the only son, he often feels left out. This causes him to purposely bring about trouble for his two sisters. He does not bond with Fran at first, having disliked all his previous nannies, but eventually becomes close with her as well. He variously plans to become a Broadway producer, like his father, or to simply wait until he can access his trust fund so he does not have to work.
* Grace &quot;Gracie&quot; Sheffield is the youngest and arguably most intelligent of the Sheffield children. At the start of the series, Gracie was undergoing psychotherapy frequently, but under Fran&#x27;s influence and guidance, she quickly reaches the point where she does not need it at all. As a result, however, she has a habit of naming medical conditions and using complicated words that Fran and Maxwell barely understand. This behavior is contrasted by her tendency to pick up some of Fran&#x27;s faux-Yinglish slang and dressing habits.

===Supporting characters===

* Sylvia Fine (née Rosenberg) is the mother of Fran Fine, portrayed in early seasons by Fran Drescher (in flashbacks to Fran&#x27;s childhood). Sylvia is based on Drescher&#x27;s real-life mother.
* Valerie Toriello is Fran&#x27;s best friend since attending kindergarten through high school together in Flushing, Queens, New York. When the show began, Val had been working at the bridal shop with Fran. Val is of Italian descent.
* Yetta Rosenberg-Jones is Fran&#x27;s grandmother and the mother of Sylvia and Uncle Jack. The character was played by actress Ann Morgan Guilbert. Yetta is based on Drescher&#x27;s real-life maternal grandmother.

Jonathan Penner appeared as Fran&#x27;s former fiancé, Danny Imperialli. James Marsden appeared as Maggie&#x27;s boyfriend, Eddie, and Telma Hopkins appeared as Fran&#x27;s &quot;mother&quot; in the episode &quot;Fran&#x27;s Roots&quot;. Scott Baio also made an appearance as a rookie doctor who was Fran&#x27;s former schoolmate. Marvin Hamlisch appeared as Fran&#x27;s former high school music teacher, a Hamlisch look-alike. Jon Stewart portrayed a Jewish love interest of Fran&#x27;s until it was discovered at a family wedding that the two were cousins; on the June 29, 2011, airing of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, Stewart stated he agreed to make an appearance after receiving a personal call from Drescher.

Drescher also reprised her role of Bobbi Fleckman from the 1984 film &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; and made a cameo appearance as herself in the third to last episode. Shaughnessy had a double role as a fictional Middle Eastern oil potentate in one episode. Drescher&#x27;s real-life parents initially appeared as a couple in the waiting room of Gracie&#x27;s therapist and made subsequent appearances as Fran&#x27;s Uncle Stanley and Aunt Rose; her Pomeranian Chester appeared as C.C.&#x27;s pet in more than a dozen episodes. Renée Taylor&#x27;s husband, actor Joseph Bologna, and their son Gabriel Bologna had guest roles on the show. Ray Romano appeared as Fran&#x27;s former high school classmate Ray Barone, linking &quot;The Nanny&quot; with his comedy &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;. Romano and Drescher both actually knew each other in high school. Tom Bergeron appeared as himself, the host of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, in an episode in which Maxwell appeared as a star on the show&#x27;s board as a replacement for Andrew Lloyd Webber. Tyne Daly appeared as a fellow nanny facing forced retirement. David Letterman made an uncredited appearance during a fantasy sequence, where Fran describes how she exaggerated her fame to impress a pen pal. Donna Douglas, who played Elly Mae Clampett on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, made her last television appearance in an episode.

==Theme song and opening credits==
The theme song featured in the pilot was a version of &quot;If My Friends Could See Me Now&quot;, performed by Gwen Verdon from the 1966 Broadway musical &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;. Following the pilot, the theme changed to &quot;The Nanny Named Fran&quot;, written by Ann Hampton Callaway and performed by her and her sister Liz Callaway. Along with the change of the theme song came a different, animated opening sequence that would be used for the entire series run. Like the song, it summarizes the events that lead Fran from losing her job and boyfriend to being hired as nanny of the Sheffield children.

The sequence begins with Fran walking into the bridal shop, only to be kicked out. A taxicab takes her across the bridge from Queens to Manhattan, and she arrives at the Sheffield mansion to sell cosmetics. Maxwell opens the door and pulls Fran into the house. She falls into a flowerpot, where Niles dusts her off and puts a cap marked &quot;Nanny&quot; on her head. At her whistle, Maxwell&#x27;s children fall in behind her and the four form a conga line. C.C. arrives at the door and Fran bumps it with her hip to close it in her face. Finally, the Sheffields, Niles and Fran gather on and around the couch for a group picture. However, the camera explodes when Fran triggers its shutter, covering everyone with soot and ruining their hair and clothes.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;The Nanny&quot; began in 1991 with a chance meeting on a transatlantic flight between Drescher and Jeff Sagansky, at the time president of CBS Corporation, for whom she had starred in the short-lived TV series &quot;Princesses&quot;. Drescher persuaded Sagansky to let her and her then-husband Jacobson pitch an idea for a sitcom to CBS. Sagansky agreed to a future meeting once all of the parties were back in Los Angeles; however, neither Drescher nor Jacobson had any idea what to pitch.

Later, Drescher was visiting friend Twiggy Lawson and her family in London, where she went on a culture-clash shopping tour with Lawson&#x27;s then-teenage daughter. Drescher was inspired by her behavior towards the teenage daughter on the shopping trip as functioning in a less parental but &quot;humorous [...] kind of Queens logic, self-serving advice&quot; mode. Drescher immediately called her husband in Los Angeles with her sitcom idea, which she pitched as a spin on &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, except, in Drescher&#x27;s words, &quot;Instead of Julie Andrews, I come to the door.&quot; Jacobson replied: &quot;That could be it&quot; and the idea for &quot;The Nanny&quot; was spawned.

Back in Los Angeles, the pair pitched their idea to Tim Flack and Joe Voci, both in comedy development at CBS. Sagansky brought in experienced producers Robert Sternin and Prudence Fraser, another husband-and-wife team with whom Drescher had worked before while guesting on &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; in 1985 and 1986. Interested, both couples teamed up to write the script for the pilot together, creating a character with the intention to build off Drescher&#x27;s image. &quot;Our business strategy was to create a show that was going to complement our writing, complement me as a talent,&quot; Drescher said in a 1997 interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. As a result, the characters draw deeply on the Drescher family, including Fran Fine&#x27;s parents, Sylvia and Morty, and grandmother Yetta, who all were named after their real-life counterparts.

Drescher also drew from her own life in creating her character. Like the character in &quot;The Nanny&quot;, Drescher was born and raised to a Jewish family in Flushing, Queens, and attended beauty school. However, unlike her on-screen counterpart, Drescher never worked in a bridal shop; Drescher wrote that into the character as a tribute to her mother, who did work in a bridal shop. While visiting with his relatives in Fort Lauderdale around the holidays, Sagansky watched a few episodes with his relatives, realized that he had a hit, and ordered a full 22 episodes for the first season.

===Crew===

Most of the early episodes of &quot;The Nanny&quot; were shot in front of a live studio audience on Stage 6 at the Culver Studios. On Mondays, the cast went through the script as a table read. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they rehearsed before the series&#x27; producers and executives. And, on Thursdays and Fridays, the series was shot using a multi-camera set-up in front of a live studio audience. During later seasons the taping was no longer performed before an audience due to the complexities of the fantasy sequences, costume changes, etc.

Nearly 100 crew members were involved in the shooting of a single episode. Although Drescher, Fraser, Jacobson and Sternin, the show&#x27;s only executive producers for the first four seasons, coordinated &quot;pretty much everything&quot; at the beginning, according to Sternin, they eventually found their niche and in the following years, Drescher and Sternin decided to focus on writing story outlines, while Jacobson presided over the writing team, and Fraser observed the run-throughs. The four of them were later joined by Frank Lombardi, Caryn Lucas and Diane Wilk, who served as the series&#x27; executive producers throughout the fifth and sixth seasons.

===Professional laughers===
Stemming from a home invasion and attack she experienced in 1985, Fran Drescher requested the show to provide prescreened audiences, based upon her fear of having random strangers invited to the productions. The show hired Central Casting to gather a cast of &quot;laughers&quot; who would be recorded during taping. The audio track of the laughers would then be added to the episodes in post-production. Casting director Lisette St. Claire became the world&#x27;s first &quot;laugher wrangler&quot; for this new type of service.

==Humor==
The comedy in &quot;The Nanny&quot; was formulated with many running gags, which contributed heavily to the success of the series. Much of this formula was character-based, with all major characters possessing a specific trait or quirks that provided a source of parody for other characters. The conflicting elements of each character&#x27;s own comedy were often played off against one another (Fran and Maxwell, Niles and C.C., Maggie and Brighton). Occasionally the characters would break the fourth wall and comment on the situations themselves, or Fran would comment to the audience or look into the camera. Other running gags are the many references to Beatles songs and the musicals &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. Most of the humor Fran uses is aimed toward a Jewish audience. She makes references to Yiddish words and teaches the Sheffield children to be stereotypical Jews. Much of this humor is featured in scenes including her mother, Sylvia.

At times, they would also make humorous references to the stars&#x27; previous careers or real-life off-screen time. This was noticeable when Yetta saw her reflection in the mirror and thought she was seeing Millie Helper from &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; (the role that Guilbert played), Maxwell remembering how he wanted to hire a former cast member from &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; but thought he was not &quot;British&quot; enough (a reference to Shaughnessy&#x27;s former series), and C.C. using props to hide Lane&#x27;s real-life pregnancy at the time. Drescher also appeared in the series as tough-talking music publicist Bobbi Fleckman, reprising her role from &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, setting up a visual gag where Fran would disguise herself as Fleckman in order to get Mr. Sheffield&#x27;s attention. More running gags include Fran&#x27;s frequent references to classic TV sitcoms (&quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; and &quot;Bewitched&quot;) and her many eccentric family members; Fran lying about her age—especially to men; Maxwell fighting through his rivalry with actual Broadway producer Andrew Lloyd Webber; Maxwell&#x27;s physical resemblance to Pierce Brosnan; Maxwell&#x27;s fondness for Kaye Ballard; and Sylvia loving food in excess. 

In one episode Streisand&#x27;s sister, Roslyn Kind appears singing a song with Fran thinking Barbra is at the Sheffield home. There was also the occasional tryst between Niles and C.C., contrasting with their typical open disdain for each other, which was actually love. Season 4 featured a running gag where both Fran and Maxwell kept secret from the other household members &quot;The Thing&quot; (Maxwell telling Fran he loves her in the season 3 finale). It is also following &quot;The Thing&quot; that whenever Maxwell makes comments denying he has feelings for Fran, she is temporarily &quot;paralyzed&quot;. In addition, there is also a great deal of physical comedy in &quot;The Nanny&quot; including exaggerated falls and chases.

Drescher&#x27;s facial expressions, when shocked or surprised, can also be seen as reminiscent of Lucille Ball&#x27;s portrayals of Lucy Ricardo and Lucy Carmichael. The parallels were suggested in a few episodes, where an exasperated Mr. Sheffield refers to Fran as &quot;Mrs. Carmichael&quot;, and asks in another: &quot;Mr. Mooney fire you from the bank again?&quot; Another Lucy reference is when he alludes to Fran and &quot;Ethel&quot; stealing John Wayne&#x27;s footprints in Hollywood, and again when Maxwell says, &quot;Miss Fine, you got some &#x27;splaining to do!&quot; like Ricky Ricardo often said to Lucy Ricardo. The episode that featured a visit from Elizabeth Taylor (who also appeared on &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;) began with Maxwell and Niles trying to hide the visit from Fran (&quot;Boys, boys, boys. Now do you think my mother gave birth to a dummy 25 years ago?&quot;) followed by her gripe &quot;You never introduce me to any of the stars that you know; I&#x27;ve got a good mind to take Little Ricky and... oh. Never mind.&quot; In another episode of &quot;The Nanny&quot;, Fran sees a man watching &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; on TV and as the theme song plays, she gets the idea to gain entry into Sheffield&#x27;s men&#x27;s only club dressed as a man.

==Broadcast==

===Domestic syndication===
The show began off-network syndication in September 1998, distributed by Columbia TriStar Television Distribution on various broadcast television networks in the United States. The show aired on Lifetime from 2000 until 2008. It could also be seen on Nick at Nite from April 2009 to October 5, 2013, in the United States, but was pulled and its timeslot of 6AM-7AM was replaced with Hangin&#x27; With Mr. Cooper.

On February 8, 2010, Drescher hosted a week-long marathon of &quot;The Nanny&quot;, titled &quot;Valentine Schmalentine&quot;, on Nick at Nite.

The success of the stunt led to Fran hosting &quot;Falling for Fran&quot;, a similar week-long Valentine&#x27;s Day marathon in February 2011.

==Home media==
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has released seasons 1, 2 and 3 of &quot;The Nanny&quot; on DVD in regions 1, 2 and 4. Season 3 was released on March 17, 2009, in Region 1, almost three years after the release of season 2. On August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library including &quot;The Nanny&quot;. They subsequently re-released the first two seasons on DVD on August 5, 2014.

On January 12, 2015, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series; they subsequently released a complete series set on May 26, 2015. It contains all 146 episodes. In late 2015, Shout! began releasing individual season sets; the fourth season was released on September 22, 2015, followed by the fifth season on December 22, 2015. The sixth and final season was released on March 15, 2016.

==Reception==
The show received positive critical reviews, with an 85% &quot;fresh&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes for the first season. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Fran Drescher elevates &quot;The Nanny&quot;&#x27;s formulaic writing with chutzpah, hairspray, and a one-of-a-kind comedic performance.&quot; However, the show performed poorly in its first year; when it was nearly cancelled, CBS executive Jeff Sagansky championed the show, citing the pilot&#x27;s historically high test numbers. According to Jacobson: &quot;At all those affiliate meetings, he used to say, &#x27;Stick by &quot;The Nanny&quot;!&#x27; He knew it was something special.&quot;

Although later emerging as a favorite at CBS, sponsors questioned whether the writers had ventured too far in terms of ethnicity and Drescher acted too obviously Jewish. The actress, however, declined to change Fran Fine into an Italian American: &quot;On TV, you have to work fast, and the most real, the most rooted in reality to me is Jewish. I wanted to do it closest to what I knew.&quot; By contrast, the producers came to the conclusion that to oppose her should be a family of British origin, so &quot;she wouldn&#x27;t come across as Jewish so much as the American you were rooting for,&quot; Sternin explained. &quot;The idea was to make her the American girl who happens to be Jewish rather than the Jewish girl working for the WASPs.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
==Other media==
===Reunion specials===

On December 6, 2004, the Lifetime network aired a reunion special &quot;The Nanny Reunion: A Nosh to Remember&quot;. The special reunited the entire cast with the exception of Davis, who had work commitments. Drescher and Gary Rosenthal served as executive producers of the special. In March 2020, Drescher announced that the cast would reunite for a live reading of the pilot episode amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The reading was released to YouTube by Sony Pictures Television on April 6, 2020. The reading featured the entire cast of the pilot—with the exception of James Marsden, who was replaced by Alex Sternin—as well as narration of the original pilot script by Jacobson and a live performance of the theme song by Ann Callaway.

===Foreign adaptations===
&quot;The Nanny&quot; was shown in more than eighty countries worldwide. In addition, several local versions of the show have been produced in other countries. These shows follow the original scripts very closely, but with minor alterations in order to adapt to their respective country&#x27;s culture. The remake in Russia was so popular that some original American writers of the show were commissioned to write new scripts after all original episodes were remade.

===Potential revival===
In June 2018, in regards to reviving the series, Drescher said, &quot;We’re talking about it. Peter and I are talking about it,&quot; Drescher told &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, referencing her ex-husband, Peter Marc Jacobson, who co-created the series with her. &quot;She would’ve maybe gotten involved in more things [that] Fran Drescher is involved with,&quot; the actress told &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;. &quot;All kinds of things from environmental issues, to health, to civil liberties, that’s what I think Fran [Fine] would be doing now – opening her big Queens mouth for the greater good.&quot;

===Stage adaptation===
On January 8, 2020, it was announced that Drescher and Jacobson were writing the book for a musical adaptation of the series. Rachel Bloom and Adam Schlesinger of &quot;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend&quot; fame were to write the songs, while Marc Bruni (&quot;&quot;) was slated to direct. Drescher will not portray the title role, as she joked that if she did &quot;We&#x27;d have to change the title to &quot;The Granny&quot;.&quot; However, since Schlesinger&#x27;s unexpected death from COVID-19, the status of the musical is unknown.

<text>Wendy Craig, born Anne Gwendolyn
Craig (born 20 June 1934) is an English actress who is best known for her appearances in the sitcoms &quot;Not in Front of the Children&quot; (1967–1970), &quot;...And Mother Makes Three&quot; (1971–1973), &quot;...And Mother Makes Five&quot; (1974–1976) and &quot;Butterflies&quot; (1978–1983). She played the role of Matron in the TV series &quot;The Royal&quot; (2003–2011).

Craig was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles for her performance in &quot;The Servant&quot; (1963) and won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in 1969 for Not in Front of the Children.

==Early life==
Anne Gwendolyn Craig was born on 20 June 1934 in Sacriston, County Durham, the daughter of farmer George Craig and his wife Anne (). She attended Durham High School for Girls, initially as a day pupil and later as a boarder, which she revisited in October 2007 to open a new building that had been named after her. She passed the 11+ examination and went to Darlington High School. When she was twelve years old the family moved to Picton, North Yorkshire and she attended nearby Yarm Grammar School. She trained as an actress at the Central School of Speech and Drama, then based in the Royal Albert Hall, London.

In 1956, Craig appeared in the West End alongside Robertson Hare in John Dighton&#x27;s farce &quot;Man Alive!&quot;.

==Career==
One of her early TV appearances was in an episode of the &quot;Danger Man&quot; series called &quot;The Gallows Tree&quot; (1961). In the 1960s Craig appeared in British films such as &quot;The Servant&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Nanny&quot; (1965) with Bette Davis, but it was her appearances in British sitcoms of the late 1960s/1970s which led to her becoming a household name, usually playing a scatty middle class housewife. She went from the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Not in Front of the Children&quot; (1967–1970) to ITV&#x27;s &quot;...And Mother Makes Three&quot; (1971–1973), in which she played a single parent, which evolved into its sequel &quot;...And Mother Makes Five&quot; (1974–1976). Then came &quot;Butterflies&quot; (1978–1983), a successful comedy on BBC2.

Craig returned to drama with the series &quot;Nanny&quot; (1981–1983), a series she created, and wrote some episodes herself as Jonathan Marr, a pseudonym she had used before when writing episodes of &quot;...And Mother Makes Five&quot;. Twenty years later, she played Matron in ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Royal&quot; (2003–2011) and she also made several appearances in the 2002 adaptation of John Galsworthy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;. However, she has continued to be associated with comedy, having taken one of the leading roles as Annie in &quot;Brighton Belles&quot; (1993–1994), the UK&#x27;s short-lived version of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;. She appeared as Reggie&#x27;s mother in the BBC One comedy &quot;Reggie Perrin&quot; (2009–2010), an update of the 1970s&#x27; series &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot;.

In 2012 Craig appeared as a guest in an episode of the cookery series &quot;MasterChef&quot;, along with many other 1970s sitcom stars. In 2014 she appeared in an episode of the BBC drama &quot;Waterloo Road&quot;.

In 2016, Craig appeared as Mary Goodman in the BBC detective series &quot;Death in Paradise&quot;. In 2017 she appeared in the second series of the ITV drama &quot;Unforgotten&quot;. Also in 2017 she starred as Miss Bat in the first three series of the CBBC programme &quot;The Worst Witch&quot;. In 2018, she appeared in the ITV soap &quot;Emmerdale&quot;. In October 2019, she appeared in an episode of &quot;Doctors&quot; alongside former &quot;Butterflies&quot; co-star Bruce Montague.

==Personal life==
Craig was married to Jack Bentley, a trombonist, scriptwriter and journalist, from 1955 until his death in 1994. During her marriage with Bentley, she had two sons: Alaster, who was later principal oboist for the Birmingham Royal Ballet Sinfonia and, as the result of an affair with John Mortimer, Ross, an IT consultant. In 2004, having heard that the secret was out, Wendy visited Mortimer to reveal formally that their affair had resulted in a son, then 42. She was at the time of the leak appearing in an episode of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;; series star John Nettles later said one of his favourite memories of the series was picking up a copy of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; on set during that filming with a headline revealing the secret, remarking that &quot;It just seemed so absolutely Midsomer&quot;.

Since the 1990s, Craig has lived in Cookham, Berkshire. She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to drama and charity.

<text>Stephen Gosson (April 1554 – 13 February 1624) was an English satirist.

==Biography==
Gosson was baptized at St George&#x27;s Church, Canterbury, on 17 April 1554. He entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 1572, and on leaving the university in 1576 he went to London. In 1598, Francis Meres in his &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; mentions him with Sir Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, Abraham Fraunce, and others as the &quot;best for pastorall&quot;, but no pastorals of Gosson&#x27;s are extant. He is said to have been an actor.

After the publication of the &quot;Schoole of Abuse&quot;, Gosson retired to the country, where he acted as tutor to the sons of a gentleman (&quot;Plays Confuted&quot;. &quot;To the Reader,&quot; 1582). Anthony à Wood places this earlier and assigns the termination of his tutorship indirectly to his animosity against the stage, which apparently wearied his patron of his company. Gosson took holy orders, was made lecturer of the parish church at Stepney (1585), and was presented by Queen Elizabeth I to the rectory of Great Wigborough, Essex, which he exchanged in 1600 for St Botolph&#x27;s, Bishopsgate.

==Works==
An anti-theatrical writer, Gosson by his own confession wrote plays, for he speaks of &quot;Catiline&#x27;s Conspiracies&quot; as a &quot;Pig of mine own Sowe.&quot; Because of their moral standpoint, he excludes such plays as these from the general condemnation of stage plays in his &quot;Schoole of Abuse, containing a pleasant invective against Poets, Pipers, Plaiers, Jesters and such like Caterpillars of the Commonwealth&quot; (1579).

The euphuistic style of this pamphlet and its ostentatious display of learning were in the taste of the time, and do not necessarily imply insincerity. Gosson justified his attack on the grounds of the disorder which the love of melodrama and of vulgar comedy was introducing into the social life of London. Edmund Spenser, in his &quot;Teares of the Muses&quot; (1591), laments the same evils, if only in general terms. The tract was dedicated to Sir Philip Sidney, who seems to have resented being connected with it. Edmund Spenser wrote to Gabriel Harvey (16 October 1579) of the dedication that the author &quot;was for hys labor scorned.&quot; Gosson dedicated, however, a second tract, &quot;The Ephemerides of Phialo ... and A Short Apologie of the Schoole of Abuse&quot;, to Sidney on 28 October 1579.

Gosson&#x27;s attack on poets seems to have had a large share in inducing Sidney to write his &quot;Apologie for Poetrie&quot;, which probably dates from 1581. The publication of his polemic provoked many retorts, the most formidable of which was Thomas Lodge&#x27;s &quot;Defence of Playes&quot; (1580). The players themselves retaliated by reviving Gosson&#x27;s own plays. Gosson replied to his various opponents in 1582 by his &quot;Playes Confuted in Five Actions&quot;, dedicated to Sir Francis Walsingham. &quot;Pleasant Quippes for Upstart New-fangled Gentlewomen&quot; (1595), a coarse satiric poem, is also ascribed to Gosson.

The &quot;Schoole of Abuse&quot; and &quot;Apologie&quot; were edited (1868) by Edward Arber in his &quot;English Reprints&quot;. Two poems of Gosson&#x27;s are included.

<doc id="302944" wikidata="Q1496376" url="?curid=302944" title="Gaussian process">
<text>In probability theory and statistics, a Gaussian process is a stochastic process (a collection of random variables indexed by time or space), such that every finite collection of those random variables has a multivariate normal distribution. The distribution of a Gaussian process is the joint distribution of all those (infinitely many) random variables, and as such, it is a distribution over functions with a continuous domain, e.g. time or space.

The concept of Gaussian processes is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss because it is based on the notion of the Gaussian distribution (normal distribution). Gaussian processes can be seen as an infinite-dimensional generalization of multivariate normal distributions.

Gaussian processes are useful in statistical modelling, benefiting from properties inherited from the normal distribution. For example, if a random process is modelled as a Gaussian process, the distributions of various derived quantities can be obtained explicitly. Such quantities include the average value of the process over a range of times and the error in estimating the average using sample values at a small set of times. While exact models often scale poorly as the amount of data increases, multiple approximation methods have been developed which often retain good accuracy while drastically reducing computation time.

==Definition==
A time continuous stochastic process formula_1 is Gaussian if and only if for every finite set of indices formula_2 in the index set formula_3

formula_4

is a multivariate Gaussian random variable. 
As the sum of independent and Gaussian distributed random variables is again Gaussian distributed, that is the same as saying every linear combination of formula_5 has a univariate Gaussian (or normal) distribution.

Using characteristic functions of random variables with formula_6 denoting the imaginary unit such that formula_7, the Gaussian property can be formulated as follows: formula_1 is Gaussian if and only if, for every finite set of indices formula_2, there are real-valued formula_10, formula_11 with formula_12 such that the following equality holds for all formula_13,

formula_14

or formula_15. 
The numbers formula_10 and formula_11 can be shown to be the covariances and means of the variables in the process.

==Variance==
The variance of a Gaussian process is finite at any time formula_18, formally
formula_19

==Stationarity==
For general stochastic processes strict-sense stationarity implies wide-sense stationarity but not every wide-sense stationary stochastic process is strict-sense stationary. However, for a Gaussian stochastic process the two concepts are equivalent.

A Gaussian stochastic process is strict-sense stationary if and only if it is wide-sense stationary.

==Example==
There is an explicit representation for stationary Gaussian processes. A simple example of this representation is

formula_20

where formula_21 and formula_22 are independent random variables with the standard normal distribution.

==Covariance functions==
A key fact of Gaussian processes is that they can be completely defined by their second-order statistics. Thus, if a Gaussian process is assumed to have mean zero, defining the covariance function completely defines the process&#x27; behaviour. Importantly the non-negative definiteness of this function enables its spectral decomposition using the Karhunen–Loève expansion. Basic aspects that can be defined through the covariance function are the process&#x27; stationarity, isotropy, smoothness and periodicity.

Stationarity refers to the process&#x27; behaviour regarding the separation of any two points formula_23 and formula_24. If the process is stationary, the covariance function depends only on formula_25. For example, the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is stationary.

If the process depends only on formula_26, the Euclidean distance (not the direction) between formula_23 and formula_24, then the process is considered isotropic. A process that is concurrently stationary and isotropic is considered to be homogeneous; in practice these properties reflect the differences (or rather the lack of them) in the behaviour of the process given the location of the observer.

Ultimately Gaussian processes translate as taking priors on functions and the smoothness of these priors can be induced by the covariance function. If we expect that for &quot;near-by&quot; input points formula_23 and formula_24 their corresponding output points formula_31 and formula_32 to be &quot;near-by&quot; also, then the assumption of continuity is present. If we wish to allow for significant displacement then we might choose a rougher covariance function. Extreme examples of the behaviour is the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck covariance function and the squared exponential where the former is never differentiable and the latter infinitely differentiable.

Periodicity refers to inducing periodic patterns within the behaviour of the process. Formally, this is achieved by mapping the input formula_23 to a two dimensional vector formula_34.

===Usual covariance functions===

There are a number of common covariance functions:
*Constant : formula_35
*Linear: formula_36
*white Gaussian noise: formula_37
*Squared exponential: formula_38
*Ornstein–Uhlenbeck: formula_39
*Matérn: formula_40
*Periodic: formula_41
*Rational quadratic: formula_42

Here formula_43. The parameter formula_44 is the characteristic length-scale of the process (practically, &quot;how close&quot; two points formula_23 and formula_24 have to be to influence each other significantly), &quot;formula_47&quot; is the Kronecker delta and formula_48 the standard deviation of the noise fluctuations. Moreover, formula_49 is the modified Bessel function of order formula_50 and formula_51 is the gamma function evaluated at formula_50. Importantly, a complicated covariance function can be defined as a linear combination of other simpler covariance functions in order to incorporate different insights about the data-set at hand.

The inferential results are dependent on the values of the hyperparameters formula_53 (e.g. formula_44 and formula_48) defining the model&#x27;s behaviour. A popular choice for formula_53 is to provide &quot;maximum a posteriori&quot; (MAP) estimates of it with some chosen prior. If the prior is very near uniform, this is the same as maximizing the marginal likelihood of the process; the marginalization being done over the observed process values formula_31. This approach is also known as &quot;maximum likelihood II&quot;, &quot;evidence maximization&quot;, or &quot;empirical Bayes&quot;.

==Continuity==

For a Gaussian process, continuity in probability is equivalent to mean-square continuity,
and continuity with probability one is equivalent to sample continuity.
The latter implies, but is not implied by, continuity in probability.
Continuity in probability holds if and only if the mean and autocovariance are continuous functions. In contrast, sample continuity was challenging even for stationary Gaussian processes (as probably noted first by Andrey Kolmogorov), and more challenging for more general processes.

As usual, by a sample continuous process one means a process that admits a sample continuous modification.

===Stationary case===

For a stationary Gaussian process formula_58 some conditions on its spectrum are sufficient for sample continuity, but fail to be necessary. A necessary and sufficient condition, sometimes called Dudley–Fernique theorem, involves the function formula_48 defined by
formula_60
(the right-hand side does not depend on formula_18 due to stationarity). Continuity of formula_62 in probability is equivalent to continuity of formula_48 at formula_64 When convergence of formula_65 to formula_66 (as formula_67) is too slow, sample continuity of formula_62 may fail. Convergence of the following integrals matters:
formula_69
these two integrals being equal according to integration by substitution formula_70 formula_71 The first integrand need not be bounded as formula_72 thus the integral may converge (formula_73) or diverge (formula_74). Taking for example formula_75 for large formula_76 that is, formula_77 for small formula_78 one obtains formula_73 when formula_80 and formula_74 when formula_82
In these two cases the function formula_48 is increasing on formula_84 but generally it is not. Moreover, the condition

does not follow from continuity of formula_48 and the evident relations formula_86 (for all formula_87) and formula_88

Some history.
Sufficiency was announced by Xavier Fernique in 1964, but the first proof was published by Richard M. Dudley in 1967.
Necessity was proved by Michael B. Marcus and Lawrence Shepp in 1970.

There exist sample continuous processes formula_62 such that formula_90 they violate condition (*). An example found by Marcus and Shepp is a random lacunary Fourier series
formula_91
where formula_92 are independent random variables with standard normal distribution; frequencies formula_93 are a fast growing sequence; and coefficients formula_94 satisfy formula_95 The latter relation implies

formula_96

whence formula_97 almost surely, which ensures uniform convergence of the Fourier series almost surely, and sample continuity of formula_98

Its autocovariation function
formula_99
is nowhere monotone (see the picture), as well as the corresponding function formula_100
formula_101

==Brownian motion as the integral of Gaussian processes==
A Wiener process (also known as Brownian motion) is the integral of a white noise generalized Gaussian process. It is not stationary, but it has stationary increments.

The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is a stationary Gaussian process.

The Brownian bridge is (like the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process) an example of a Gaussian process whose increments are not independent.

The fractional Brownian motion is a Gaussian process whose covariance function is a generalisation of that of the Wiener process.

==RKHS structure and Gaussian process==

Let formula_102 be a mean-zero Gaussian process formula_1 with a non-negative definite covariance function formula_104 and let formula_105 be a symmetric and positive semidefinite function. Then, there exists a Gaussian process formula_106 which has the covariance formula_105. Moreover, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) associated to formula_108 coincides with the Cameron–Martin theorem associated space formula_109 of formula_106, and all the spaces formula_109, formula_112, and formula_113 are isometric. From now on, let formula_114 be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with positive definite kernel formula_115.

Driscoll&#x27;s zero-one law is a result characterizing the sample functions generated by a Gaussian process:
formula_116
where formula_117 and formula_118 are the covariance matrices of all possible pairs of formula_119 points, implies 
formula_120

Moreover, 
formula_121
implies 
formula_122

This has significant implications when formula_123, as
formula_124

As such, almost all sample paths of a mean-zero Gaussian process with positive definite kernel formula_104 will lie outside of the Hilbert space formula_113.

==Linearly constrained Gaussian processes==
For many applications of interest some pre-existing knowledge about the system at hand is already given. Consider e.g. the case where the output of the Gaussian process corresponds to a magnetic field; here, the real magnetic field is bound by Maxwell&#x27;s equations and a way to incorporate this constraint into the Gaussian process formalism would be desirable as this would likely improve the accuracy of the algorithm.

A method on how to incorporate linear constraints into Gaussian processes already exists:

Consider the (vector valued) output function formula_127 which is known to obey the linear constraint (i.e. formula_128 is a linear operator)
formula_129
Then the constraint formula_128 can be fulfilled by choosing formula_131, where formula_132 is modelled as a Gaussian process, and finding formula_133 such that 
formula_134
Given formula_133 and using the fact that Gaussian processes are closed under linear transformations, the Gaussian process for formula_102 obeying constraint formula_128 becomes
formula_138
Hence, linear constraints can be encoded into the mean and covariance function of a Gaussian process.

==Applications==

A Gaussian process can be used as a prior probability distribution over functions in Bayesian inference. Given any set of &quot;N&quot; points in the desired domain of your functions, take a multivariate Gaussian whose covariance matrix parameter is the Gram matrix of your &quot;N&quot; points with some desired kernel, and sample from that Gaussian. For solution of the multi-output prediction problem, Gaussian process regression for vector-valued function was developed. In this method, a &#x27;big&#x27; covariance is constructed, which describes the correlations between all the input and output variables taken in &quot;N&quot; points in the desired domain. This approach was elaborated in detail for the matrix-valued Gaussian processes and generalised to processes with &#x27;heavier tails&#x27; like Student-t processes.

Inference of continuous values with a Gaussian process prior is known as Gaussian process regression, or kriging; extending Gaussian process regression to multiple target variables is known as &quot;cokriging&quot;. Gaussian processes are thus useful as a powerful non-linear multivariate interpolation tool. Kriging is also used to extend Gaussian process in the case of mixed integer inputs.

Gaussian processes are also commonly used to tackle numerical analysis problems such as numerical integration, solving differential equations, or optimisation in the field of probabilistic numerics.

Gaussian processes can also be used in the context of mixture of experts models, for example. The underlying rationale of such a learning framework consists in the assumption that a given mapping cannot be well captured by a single Gaussian process model. Instead, the observation space is divided into subsets, each of which is characterized by a different mapping function; each of these is learned via a different Gaussian process component in the postulated mixture.

In the natural sciences, Gaussian processes have found use as probabilistic models of astronomical time series and as predictors of molecular properties. They are also being increasingly used as surrogate models for force field optimization.

===Gaussian process prediction, or Kriging===
When concerned with a general Gaussian process regression problem (Kriging), it is assumed that for a Gaussian process formula_102 observed at coordinates formula_23, the vector of values is just one sample from a multivariate Gaussian distribution of dimension equal to number of observed coordinates . Therefore, under the assumption of a zero-mean distribution, , where is the covariance matrix between all possible pairs for a given set of hyperparameters &quot;θ&quot;.
As such the log marginal likelihood is:

formula_141

and maximizing this marginal likelihood towards provides the complete specification of the Gaussian process . One can briefly note at this point that the first term corresponds to a penalty term for a model&#x27;s failure to fit observed values and the second term to a penalty term that increases proportionally to a model&#x27;s complexity. Having specified , making predictions about unobserved values at coordinates is then only a matter of drawing samples from the predictive distribution formula_142 where the posterior mean estimate is defined as
formula_143
and the posterior variance estimate &quot;B&quot; is defined as:
formula_144
where is the covariance between the new coordinate of estimation &quot;x&quot;* and all other observed coordinates &quot;x&quot; for a given hyperparameter vector , and are defined as before and is the variance at point as dictated by . It is important to note that practically the posterior mean estimate of (the &quot;point estimate&quot;) is just a linear combination of the observations ; in a similar manner the variance of is actually independent of the observations . A known bottleneck in Gaussian process prediction is that the computational complexity of inference and likelihood evaluation is cubic in the number of points |&quot;x&quot;|, and as such can become unfeasible for larger data sets. Works on sparse Gaussian processes, that usually are based on the idea of building a &quot;representative set&quot; for the given process &quot;f&quot;, try to circumvent this issue. The kriging method can be used in the latent level of a nonlinear mixed-effects model for a spatial functional prediction: this technique is called the latent kriging.

Often, the covariance has the form formula_145, where formula_146 is a scaling parameter. Examples are the Matérn class covariance functions. If this scaling parameter formula_146 is either known or unknown (i.e. must be marginalized), then the posterior probability, formula_148, i.e. the probability for the hyperparameters formula_53 given a set of data pairs formula_150 of observations of formula_23 and formula_127, admits an analytical expression.

=== Bayesian neural networks as Gaussian processes ===

Bayesian neural networks are a particular type of Bayesian network that results from treating deep learning and artificial neural network models probabilistically, and assigning a prior distribution to their parameters. Computation in artificial neural networks is usually organized into sequential layers of artificial neurons. The number of neurons in a layer is called the layer width. As layer width grows large, many Bayesian neural networks reduce to a Gaussian process with a closed form compositional kernel. This Gaussian process is called the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). It allows predictions from Bayesian neural networks to be more efficiently evaluated, and provides an analytic tool to understand deep learning models.

== Computational issues ==
In practical applications, Gaussian process models are often evaluated on a grid leading to multivariate normal distributions. Using these models for prediction or parameter estimation using maximum likelihood requires evaluating a multivariate Gaussian density, which involves calculating the determinant and the inverse of the covariance matrix. Both of these operations have cubic computational complexity which means that even for grids of modest sizes, both operations can have a prohibitive computational cost. This drawback led to the development of multiple approximation methods.

<text>The preputial mucosa of the penis is the epithelium of the inside of the prepuce, or foreskin. To differentiate it from the cutaneous skin of the outside of the prepuce, it is sometimes referred to as the inner mucosa. It starts at the ridged band of the prepuce and continues to the coronal sulcus (groove behind the glans penis), where it meets the epithelium of the glans and penile shaft. The preputial mucosa is devoid of hair, as is the cutaneous surface.

Weiss &quot;et al&quot;. (1993) report the preputial mucosa contains fewer Langerhans cells than most mucosal epithelia. These cells secrete cytokines (a non-antibody protein that generates an immune response on contact with specific antigens), and are an essential part of the immune system. Fleiss &quot;et al&quot;. (1998) point out that Weiss &quot;et al&quot;. (1993) studied foreskins of neonates and their findings may not be applicable to adults. De Witte &quot;et al&quot;. (2007) report that Langerhans cells produce Langerin. Langerin inhibits the infection of T-cells with HIV-1.

Dinh &quot;et al&quot;. (2012) compared the depth of the keratin layer of the inner foreskin with the depth of the keratin layer outer foreskin in foreskins of healthy Ugandan males who had been circumcised. The researchers concluded that, &quot;despite inter- and intra-individual variability, keratin thickness was similar in the inner and outer foreskin of healthy Ugandan men, and that reduced keratin thickness is not likely to make the inner foreskin more susceptible to HIV acquisition.&quot;

Fleiss &quot;et al&quot;. (1998) report the inner mucosa contains apocrine glands, which secrete cathepsin B, lysozyme, chymotrypsin, neutrophil elastase, and hormones such as androsterone. The first four substances have protective immunological functions. This view is currently controversial and a histological study reported that the mucosal surface of the prepuce is completely free of lanugo hair follicles, apocrine (sweat) and sebaceous glands.

<text>Abraham Fraunce ( – ) was an English poet.

==Life==
A native of Shropshire, he was born between 1558 and 1560. His name appears in a list of pupils of Shrewsbury School in January 1571, and he joined St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1576, becoming a fellow in 1580/1. His Latin comedy, &quot;Victoria&quot;, dedicated to Sir Philip Sidney, was probably written at Cambridge, where he remained until he had taken his M.A. degree in 1583. He was called to the bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1588, and then apparently practised as a barrister in the court of the Welsh marches.

After the death of his patron, Sidney, Fraunce was protected by Sidney&#x27;s sister, Mary Herbert, Countess of Pembroke. His last work was published in 1592. According to the 19th-century antiquary Joseph Hunter in his &quot;Chorus Vatum&quot;, in 1633 Fraunce wrote an &quot;Epithalamium&quot; in honour of the marriage of Lady Magdalen Egerton, seventh daughter of the Earl of Bridgwater, in whose service he may have been; thus, it was long assumed that Fraunce died in or after 1633. More recent scholarship, however, places Fraunce&#x27;s death in 1592 or 1593 and attributes the Cutler-Egerton epithalamium to Abraham Darcie.

==Works==
His works are:
* &quot;The Lamentations of Amintas for the death of Phyllis&quot; (1587), a version in English hexameters of his friend, Thomas Watson&#x27;s, Latin &quot;Amyntas&quot;
* &quot;The Lawiers Logike, exemplifying the praecepts of Logike by the practise of the common Lawe&quot; (1585)
* &quot;The Arcadian Rhetorike&quot; (1588)
* &quot;Abrahami Fransi Insignium, Armorum ... explicatio&quot; (1588)
* &quot;The Countess of Pembroke&#x27;s Yvychurch&quot; (1591/2), containing a translation of Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Aminta&quot;, a reprint of his earlier version of Watson
* &quot;The Lamentation of Corydon for the love of Alexis&quot; (Virgil, eclogue II), a short translation from Heliodorus, and, in the third part (1592) &quot;Aminta&#x27;s Dale,&quot; a collection of &quot;conceited tales&quot; supposed to be related by the nymphs of Ivychurch
* &quot;The Countess of Pembroke&#x27;s Emanuell&quot; (1591)
* The Third Part of Pembroke&#x27;s &quot;Ivychurch&quot;, entitled &quot;Aminta&#x27;s Dale&quot; (1592)
* &quot;Victoria, a Latin Comedy&quot; (written before or in 1583; not published until 1906). It is a translation of Luigi Pasqualigo&#x27;s play, &quot;Il Fedele&quot;.

The &quot;Arcadian Rhetorike&quot; owes much to earlier critical treatises, but has a special interest from its references to Edmund Spenser, and Fraunce quotes from the &quot;Faerie Queene&quot; a year before the publication of the first books. In &quot;Colin Clouts Come Home Again&quot;, Spenser speaks of Fraunce as Corydon, on account of his translations of Virgil&#x27;s second eclogue. His poems are written in classical metres, and he was regarded by his contemporaries as the best exponent of Gabriel Harvey&#x27;s theory. Even Thomas Nashe had a good word for &quot;sweete Master Fraunce&quot;.

&quot;The Countess of Pembroke&#x27;s Emanuell, hexameters on the nativity and passion of Christ&quot;, with versions of some psalms, were reprinted by Alexander Grosart in the third volume of his &quot;Miscellanies of the Fuller Worthies&#x27; Library&quot; (1872). Joseph Hunter in his &quot;Chorus Vatum&quot; stated that five of Fraunce&#x27;s songs were included in Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Astrophel and Stella&quot;, but these should probably be attributed not to Fraunce, but to Thomas Campion. See a life prefixed to the transcription of a manuscript Latin comedy by Fraunce, &quot;Victoria&quot;, by Professor GC Moore Smith, published in W Bang&#x27;s &quot;Materialien zur Kunde des älteren Englischen Dramas&quot;, vol. xiv, 1906.

Dana Sutton argues that Fraunce may be the author of &quot;Hymenaeus&quot; (1578).

<text>&quot;Bella ciao&quot; (; &quot;Goodbye beautiful&quot;) is an Italian song dedicated to the partisans of the Italian resistance, who fought against the occupying troops of Germany and the collaborationist Fascist forces during the liberation of Italy. It was based on a folk song of the late 19th century, sung by female workers of the paddy fields in Northern Italy (&quot;mondine&quot;) in protest against harsh working conditions. Versions of &quot;Bella ciao&quot; continue to be sung worldwide as a hymn of resistance.

==History==
The origins of the song are unclear, although one hypothesis is that &quot;Bella Ciao&quot; was originally sung as &quot;Alla mattina appena alzata&quot; (&quot;In the morning as soon as I woke up&quot;) by seasonal workers of paddy fields of rice, especially in Italy&#x27;s Po Valley from the late 19th century to the first half of the 20th century, with different lyrics. They worked at &quot;&quot; (weeding) the rice fields in northern Italy, to help the healthy growth of young rice plants. This work was performed during the flooding of the fields, from the end of April to the beginning of June every year. During this time, the first stages of the rice plants&#x27; development, the delicate shoots needed to be protected from the difference in temperature between the day and the night. It consisted of two phases: transplanting the plants and pruning the weeds.

Mondare was an extremely tiring task, carried out primarily by women known as &quot;mondine&quot; (plural; singular &quot;mondina&quot;), from the poorest social classes. They would spend their workdays with bare feet in water up to their knees, and their backs bent continuously. The atrocious working conditions, long hours and very low pay led to constant dissatisfaction and, at times, to rebellious movements and riots in the early years of the 20th century. The struggles against the supervising &quot;padroni&quot; (an employer who completely controls his or her workers, especially one who exploits Italian immigrants) were even harder, with plenty of clandestine workers ready to compromise even further the already low wages just to get work. Besides &quot;Bella ciao&quot;, similar songs of the mondina women included &quot; and &quot;.

Other versions of the antecedents of &quot;Bella ciao&quot; appeared over the years, indicating that &quot;Alla mattina appena alzata&quot; must have been composed in the latter half of the 19th century. The earliest written version is dated back to 1906 and comes from near Vercelli, Piedmont.

=== As a partisan song ===
There are no indications of the relevance of &quot;Bella ciao&quot; among the partisan brigades, nor of the very existence of the &#x27;partisan version&#x27; prior to the first publication of the text in 1953. There are no traces in the documents of the immediate postwar period nor its presence in important songbooks. It is not, for example, in Pasolini&#x27;s 1955 nor in the &quot;Canti Politici&quot; of Editori Riuniti of 1962. The 1963 version of Yves Montand shot to fame after the group Il Nuovo Canzoniere Italiano presented it at the 1964 Festival dei Due Mondi at Spoleto both as a song of the mondine and as a partisan hymn, and the latter so &quot;inclusive&quot; that it could hold together the various political souls of the national liberation struggle (Catholics, Communists, Socialists, Liberals...) and even be sung at the end of the Christian Democracy (Democrazia Cristiana) 1975 congress which elected the former partisan Zaccagnini as national secretary&quot;.

As reported in the text by Roberto Battaglia &quot;History of the Italian Resistance&quot; popular songs of the era were &quot;Fischia il vento&quot; and the aria of the famous Soviet folk song &quot;Katjuša&quot;, which became the official anthem of the Garibaldi Partisan Brigades.Even the well-known journalist, former partisan and historian of the partisan struggle, Giorgio Bocca publicly stated:

These statements were later certified by Carlo Pestelli in his book &quot;Bella ciao. The song of freedom&quot;, in which he reconstructs the origins and spread of the song.

Even the historians of the Italian song Antonio Virgilio Savona and Michele Straniero have affirmed that &quot;Bella ciao&quot; was not sung or was rarely sung during the partisan war, but was widespread immediately after the Second World War.

Only a few voices, such as that of the historians Cesare Bermani and Ruggero Giacomini, claim that some version of &quot;Bella ciao&quot; was sung by some brigades during the Resistance, although not necessarily in the now popular &#x27;partisan version&#x27;, of whose existence, as specified above, there is no documentary evidence until the 1950s.

The text as sung today was first published in 1953 in the magazine &quot;La Lapa&quot;, and then in &quot;L&#x27;Unità&quot; in 1957.

== Melody ==

A possible origin of the melody was identified by researcher Fausto Giovannardi, following the discovery of a Yiddish melody (Koilen song) recorded by a Russian Klezmer accordionist, Mishka Ziganoff, in 1919 in New York. According to the scholar Rod Hamilton of The British Library in London, &quot;Koilen&quot; is a version of &quot;Dus Zekele Koilen&quot; (The bag of coal), of which there are various versions dating back to the 1920s.

Italian folksinger Giovanna Daffini recorded the song in 1962. The music is in quadruple meter.

==In popular culture==
As an internationally known hymn of freedom, it was intoned at many historic and revolutionary events. The song originally aligned itself with Italian partisans fighting against Nazi German occupation troops, but has since become to merely stand for the inherent rights of all people to be liberated from tyranny.

=== Renewed popularity ===
In 2017 and 2018, the song received renewed popularity due to the singing of &quot;Bella ciao&quot; multiple times in the Spanish television series &quot;Money Heist&quot;. The character Tokyo recounts in one of her narrations, &quot;The life of the Professor revolved around a single idea: Resistance. His grandfather, who had fought against the fascists in Italy, taught him the song and he taught us.&quot; The song is played in emblematic moments in the series as a metaphor for freedom.

In the German protests against the rising right-extremist party AfD in January 2025, the song was chanted by around 600 people in Würzburg. The event produced a viral TikTok-video with 3.4 million views within 4 days, documenting the chants during the protest. 

=== Miscellaneous ===

In April 2018, supporters from the Portuguese football club F.C. Porto adapted the song with the lyrics &quot;&quot; (&quot;Bye bye fifth&quot;), as a taunt referring to the lost opportunity by rival club S.L. Benfica to win a fifth consecutive national championship, a feat realized in Portugal by F.C. Porto.

The song was the basis of a taunt by Brazilian fans used during World Cup 2018 exemplifying the Argentina–Brazil football rivalry, and the unrealized elimination during the first round in another attempt by Argentina at a 5th Cup title cut short if they were eliminated. The lyrics made references to Argentine players Di María, Mascherano, and Messi.

The song was the inspiration for the #EleNão movement against right wing Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro.

During nationwide protests in Colombia in 2019, the anti-fascist song was adapted by demonstrators to oppose the government of Iván Duque of the Centro Democrático party, who have been for years questioned or investigated for systematic violations of the Constitution, the environment, Human Rights and Crimes against humanity. As the presidential period of Duque ends in 2022, since 2019 the song, dubbed as &#x27;Duque Chao&#x27;, is sung and interpreted in protests in Colombia and by the diáspora, also during the national strike demonstrations of April and May 2021, in which citizens have been killed, injured and disappeared by state police forces.

In March 2020, the song once again gained international attention after Europeans and Italians in lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and Europe sang &quot;Bella ciao&quot; from the balconies of their housing complexes.

In 2023, unionists from the Italian General Confederation of Labour, Italian Confederation of Trade Unions, and Italian Labour Union sang &quot;Bella Ciao&quot; to protest Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has been criticized for her party&#x27;s neo-fascist origins. Similarly, in 2024, left-wing MEPs sang &quot;Bella Ciao&quot; in the European Parliament on the occasion of a visit by Hungary&#x27;s authoritarian prime minister Viktor Orbán.

<text>Walter Harry Pitts, Jr. (April 23, 1923 – May 14, 1969) was an American logician who worked in the field of computational neuroscience. He proposed landmark theoretical formulations of neural activity and generative processes that influenced diverse fields such as cognitive sciences and psychology, philosophy, neurosciences, computer science, artificial neural networks, cybernetics and artificial intelligence, together with what has come to be known as the generative sciences. He is best remembered for having written along with Warren Sturgis McCulloch, a seminal paper in scientific history, titled &quot;A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity&quot; (1943). This paper proposed the first mathematical model of a neural network. The unit of this model, a simple formalized neuron, is still the standard of reference in the field of neural networks. It is often called a McCulloch–Pitts neuron. Prior to that paper, he formalized his ideas regarding the fundamental steps to building a Turing machine in &quot;The Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics&quot; in an essay titled &quot;Some observations on the simple neuron circuit&quot;.

==Early life==
Walter Pitts was born in Detroit, Michigan on April 23, 1923, the son of Walter and Marie (née Welsia). An autodidact, he taught himself logic and mathematics as a child and became a proficient reader in several languages, including Greek and Latin. He is widely remembered for having spent three days in a library, at the age of 12, reading &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; and sent a letter to Bertrand Russell pointing out what he considered serious problems with the first half of the first volume. Russell was appreciative and invited him to study at Cambridge University at age 12. The offer was not taken up; however, Pitts did decide to become a logician. At age 15 he left home to study.

==Academic career==
Pitts probably continued to correspond with Bertrand Russell; and at the age of 15 he attended Russell&#x27;s lectures at the University of Chicago. He stayed there, without registering as a student. While there, in 1938 he met Jerome Lettvin, a pre-medical student, and the two became close friends. Russell was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago in the fall of 1938, and he directed Pitts to study with the logician Rudolf Carnap. Pitts met Carnap at Chicago by walking into his office during office hours, and presenting him with an annotated version of Carnap&#x27;s recent book on logic, &quot;The Logical Syntax of Language&quot;. Since Pitts did not introduce himself, Carnap spent months searching for him, and, when he found him, he obtained for him a menial job at the university and had Pitts study with him. Pitts at the time was homeless and without income. He mastered Carnap&#x27;s abstract logic, then met with and was intrigued by the work of the Ukrainian mathematical physicist Nicolas Rashevsky, who was also at Chicago and was the founder of mathematical biophysics, remodeling biology on the structure of the physical sciences and mathematical logic. Pitts also worked closely with the mathematician Alston Scott Householder, who was a member of Rashevsky&#x27;s group. During his studies under Carnap, Pitts was also a regular attendant at Nicolas Rashevsky’s seminars in theoretical biology, which included Frank Offner, Herbert Landahl, Alston Householder, and the neuroanatomist Gerhardt von Bonin from the University of Illinois at Chicago. In 1940, Von Bonin introduced Lettvin to Warren McCulloch, who would become a professor of psychiatry at Illinois.

In 1941 Warren McCulloch took a position as professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and in early 1942 he invited Pitts, who was still homeless, together with Lettvin to live with his family. In the evenings, McCulloch and Pitts collaborated. Pitts was familiar with the work of Gottfried Leibniz on computing and they considered the question of whether the nervous system could be considered a kind of universal computing device as described by Leibniz. This led to their seminal neural networks paper &quot;A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity&quot;. After five years of unofficial studies, the University of Chicago awarded Pitts an Associate of Arts (his only earned degree) for his work on the paper.

In 1943, Lettvin introduced Pitts to Norbert Wiener at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Their first meeting, where they discussed Wiener&#x27;s proof of the ergodic theorem, went so well that Pitts moved to Greater Boston to work with Wiener. While Pitts was an unofficial student under the aegis of Wiener at MIT until their acrimonious parting in 1952, he formally enrolled as a graduate student in the physics department during the 1943–1944 academic year and in the electrical engineering department from 1956–1958.

In 1944, Pitts was hired by Kellex Corporation (later acquired in 1950 by Vitro Corporation) in New York City, part of the Atomic Energy Project.

From 1946, Pitts was a core member of the Macy conferences, whose principal purpose was to set the foundations for a general science of the workings of the human mind.

==Personal life, emotional trauma and decline==
In 1951, Wiener convinced Jerome Wiesner to hire some physiologists of the nervous system. A group was established with Pitts, Lettvin, McCulloch, and Pat Wall. Pitts wrote a large dissertation on the properties of neural nets connected in three dimensions. Lettvin described him as &quot;in no uncertain sense the genius of the group … when you asked him a question, you would get back a whole textbook.&quot; Pitts never married. Pitts was also described as an eccentric, refusing to allow his name to be made publicly available. He continued to refuse all offers of advanced degrees or positions of authority at MIT, in part as he would have to sign his name.

In 1952, Wiener suddenly turned against McCulloch—his wife, Margaret Wiener, hated McCulloch—and broke off relations with anyone connected to him, including Pitts.

Although he remained employed as a research associate in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT &quot;as little more than a technicality&quot; for the rest of his life, Pitts became increasingly socially isolated. In 1959, the paradigmatic &quot;What the Frog’s Eye Tells the Frog’s Brain&quot; (credited to Humberto Maturana, Lettvin, McCulloch and Pitts) conclusively demonstrated that &quot;analog processes in the eye were doing at least part of the interpretive work&quot; in image processing as opposed to &quot;the brain computing information digital neuron by digital neuron using the exacting implement of mathematical logic&quot;, leading Pitts to burn his unpublished doctoral dissertation on probabilistic three-dimensional neural networks and years of unpublished research. He took little further interest in work, excepting only a collaboration with Lettvin and Robert Gesteland which produced a paper on olfaction in 1965.

Pitts died in 1969 of bleeding esophageal varices, a condition usually associated with cirrhosis and alcoholism.

His real name is thought to have been Matthew King; whether &quot;Tom&quot; was a nickname or an error in reporting his crimes is uncertain, but it is the name by which he has become popularly known. Some sources claim that he was nicknamed &quot;The Gentleman Highwayman&quot; and he was also known as “Captain Tom King”. A contemporary account of his last robbery also mentions a brother, either John or Robert King, who was captured by the authorities on that occasion. Other reports also mention an “Elizabeth King”, possibly his wife who is mentioned in King&#x27;s will.

King&#x27;s fame rests mainly on his association with highwayman Dick Turpin. According to &quot;The Newgate Calendar&quot; (published nearly forty years after the deaths of Turpin and King), their first encounter occurred when &quot;Turpin, seeing him well mounted and appearing like a gentleman, thought that was the time to recruit his pockets&quot;, and tried to rob him.

The Newgate Calendar goes on to say that King was &quot;very well known about the country&quot;. According to legend, the two joined forces and hid out in a cave in Epping Forest and pursued a successful partnership. Their first crime together was to steal a race horse called White Stockings or Whitestocking, but it was under King&#x27;s influence that Turpin turned from his life of petty crime to a career as a highwayman. On 2 May 1737, during a robbery that went wrong, King was shot, possibly by Turpin himself. The &quot;Stamford Mercury&quot; reported on 12 May 1737 that King had been &#x27;shot through the shoulder&#x27; and, on the same day, the &quot;Derby Mercury&quot; reported that King was &#x27;attended by two surgeons&#x27; at New Prison in Clerkenwell. King later died of his wounds on 19 May 1737, aged about 25. He was buried at St James’ churchyard in Clerkenwell on 21 May 1737. In his will, King bequeathed the entirety of his effects to his “loving wife Elizabeth King.”

==In popular culture==
*King appears in Harrison Ainsworth&#x27;s romantic novel &quot;Rookwood&quot;, published in 1834. This has been the source of much pseudo-historical information about both King and Turpin.
*A play entitled &quot;Dick Turpin &amp; Tom King&quot; was written by Victorian playwright W. E. Suter in 1861.

<text>Sir Edward Dyer (October 1543 – May 1607) was an English courtier and poet.

==Life==

The son of Sir Thomas Dyer, Kt., he was born at Sharpham Park, Glastonbury, Somerset. He was educated, according to Anthony Wood, either at Balliol College, Oxford or at Broadgates Hall (later Pembroke College, Oxford), and left after taking a degree. After some time abroad, he appeared at Elizabeth I&#x27;s court. His first patron was Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, who seems to have thought of putting him forward as a rival to Sir Christopher Hatton for the queen&#x27;s favour. He is mentioned by Gabriel Harvey, along with Sir Philip Sidney, as one of the ornaments of the court. Sidney, in his will, bequeathed his books equally between Fulke Greville and Dyer. He was made steward of Woodstock in 1570.

He was employed by Elizabeth on a mission (1584) to the Low Countries, and in 1589 was sent to Denmark. In a commission to inquire into manors unjustly alienated from the crown in the west country he did not altogether please the queen, but nevertheless received a grant of some forfeited lands in Somerset in 1588. He was returned the Member of Parliament for Somerset in 1589 and 1593.

He was knighted and made Chancellor of the Order of the Garter in 1596. William Oldys said of him that he &quot;would not stoop to fawn,&quot; and some of his verses seem to show that he disliked the pressures of life at court. Under James I he lost the stewardship of Woodstock around 1604.

He died in 1607 and was buried in the chancel of St Saviour&#x27;s, Southwark, on 11 May 1607 (21 May N.S.). Administration of his estate was granted to his sister Margaret.

==Works==
Wood says that many thought Dyer to be a Rosicrucian, and that he was a firm believer in alchemy, although it is doubtful that an organised Rosicrucian movement existed during Dyer&#x27;s lifetime. He had a great reputation as a poet among his contemporaries, but very little of his work has survived. George Puttenham, in the &quot;Arte of English Poesie&quot; speaks of &quot;Maister Edward Dyar, for Elegie most sweete, solemne, and of high conceit.&quot; One of the poems once universally accepted as his is &quot;My Mynde to me a kingdome is&quot;, which Steven W. May considers as possibly written by Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.

Among the poems in &quot;England&#x27;s Helicon&quot; (1600), signed S.E.D., and included in Dr A.B. Grosart&#x27;s collection of Dyer&#x27;s works (&quot;Miscellanies of the Fuller Worthies Library&quot;, vol. iv, 1876) is the charming pastoral &quot;My Phillis hath the morninge sunne,&quot; but this comes from the &quot;Phillis&quot; of Thomas Lodge. Grosart also prints a prose tract entitled &quot;The Prayse of Nothing&quot; (1585). The &quot;Sixe Idillia&quot; from Theocritus, reckoned by John Payne Collier among Dyer&#x27;s works, were dedicated to, not written by, him.

In 1943 Alden Brooks proposed Sir Edward Dyer as a candidate in the Shakespearean authorship question in his book &quot;Will Shakspere and the Dyer’s Hand&quot;.

<doc id="302954" wikidata="Q981485" url="?curid=302954" title="Garfield Sobers">
<text>The Right Excellent Sir Garfield St Aubrun Sobers, NH, AO, OCC (born 28 July 1936), also known as Sir Gary or Sir Garry Sobers, is a Barbadian born former cricketer who played for the West Indies between 1954 and 1974. A highly skilled bowler, an aggressive batsman and an excellent fielder, he is widely considered to be cricket&#x27;s greatest ever all-rounder and one of the greatest cricketers of all time.

Born in Bridgetown, Barbados, Sobers made his first-class debut for the Barbados cricket team at the age of 16 in 1953, and his Test debut for the West Indies the following year. Originally playing mainly as a bowler, he was soon promoted up the batting order. Against Pakistan in 1958, Sobers scored his maiden Test century, progressing to 365 not out and establishing a new record for the highest individual score in an innings. His record was not broken until Brian Lara scored 375 in 1994. Sobers was made captain of the West Indies in 1965, a role which he would hold until 1972. He would also captain a Rest of the World XI during their 1970 tour of England.

Overall, Sobers played 93 Tests for the West Indies, scoring 8032 runs at an average of 57.78, and taking 235 wickets at an average of 34.03. He has the fifth-highest batting average in Test cricket in the list of cricketers with more than 5,000 runs. In his 383 first-class matches, he scored over 28,000 runs and took over 1000 wickets, having spent time with South Australia and Nottinghamshire towards the end of his career. Sobers was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1975 for his services to cricket. He became a dual Barbadian-Australian citizen through marriage in 1980. By an act of Parliament in 1998, Sobers was named as one of the eleven National Heroes of Barbados. In 2009, Sobers was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

==1936–1954: early years==

Garfield St Aubrun Sobers was born on 28 July 1936 to Shamont and Thelma Sobers of Walcott Avenue, Bay Land, St Michael, Bridgetown, Barbados, and was the fifth of six children. At birth he had two extra fingers, one on each hand. Sobers was only five when his father died at sea in January 1942, after his ship was torpedoed by a German U-boat.

From an early age, Sobers demonstrated the ability and enthusiasm to play with great skill almost any sport involving a ball, particularly cricket, football and basketball. He and his similarly talented brother Gerald helped their Bay Street Boys&#x27; School team to win the primary school Inter-School Cricket championship for three consecutive years. When he was 13, he was recruited to play for two local cricket teams; the Kent St Philip club in the Barbados Cricket League (BCL), and the Wanderers club, located at Bay Land, in the Barbados Cricket Association (BCA). Garnet Ashby, captain of Kent St Philip, told him that this was his opportunity to play cricket with &quot;the big boys&quot;.

Sobers gained useful experience by bowling to Wanderers batsmen, including West Indies Test player Denis Atkinson, at practice in the nets and soon developed his great skill as a left arm spin bowler. More importantly for his career, he was observed by Inspector Wilfred Farmer, captain of the Police team in the BCL First Division. Farmer offered Sobers a chance to play for the Police team in the 1951–52 season, while he was still only 15. In the 1952–53 season, Sobers was invited to the Barbados trials for the colony&#x27;s tour match against the Indian touring team at Kensington Oval, Bridgetown. He was initially selected as 12th man but then made the team itself when Frank King was forced to withdraw with an injury. He therefore made his first-class debut on 31 January 1953, aged only 16. Batting at number nine, he scored 7 not out in his only innings but made an immediate impression as a bowler, taking 4/50 and 3/92.

A full year passed before Sobers, now 17, made his second first-class appearance, again playing against a touring team. He batted at number five against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), scoring 46 and 27; and took two wickets in the match. He had shown enough talent in these two matches to be selected for West Indies and his third first-class appearance was his Test debut.

==International cricket career==

===1954–1957: early Test career===

Sobers had progressed quickly and made his Test debut in March 1954, aged 17, against England at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica, for the fifth and final Test, after Alf Valentine had fallen ill. Sobers was selected as a bowler, despite only mediocre performances against England for Barbados. He made a good impression by taking 4/75 in England&#x27;s first innings, including a wicket in his opening over. Sobers also scored 14 not out and 26 batting at number nine; however, England won the match by nine wickets.

Australia toured the West Indies in 1954–55, and their all-rounder Keith Miller thought that Sobers would become a better batsman than bowler despite batting in the lower-order. Sobers was not selected for the First Test, which the West Indies lost by nine wickets. However, he regained his place for the Second Test in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. The match was a high-scoring draw, with Sobers scoring 47 and eight not out. He was barely used with the ball, bowling three overs for ten runs, as Australia amassed a first-innings total of over 600.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS Sobers / Test matches/ All-round records&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sobers was given a further opportunity in the next Test in Georgetown, Guyana (British Guiana at the time) in South America. Despite scoring only 12 and 11 with the bat, he took three wickets in the Australians&#x27; first innings. Nevertheless, Australia won by eight wickets. West Indian captain and opening batsman Jeff Stollmeyer twisted his ankle after treading on a ball ahead of the Fourth Test in Barbados, &quot;triggering huge debate about who should open.&quot; Eventually, Sobers was chosen to open the innings after Australia had amassed another total of over 600. Sobers had a suspicion he might be asked to do the job. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t see them sending in anyone else—I was a bowler with a little ability as a batsman and they wanted someone to help see off the shine and protect the three Ws.&quot; Sobers struck his first three deliveries for boundaries, all from the bowling of Miller. In the fast bowler&#x27;s second over, Sobers hit him for another three fours. He was eventually dismissed for 43 out of a first-wicket partnership of 52 with John Holt. The match was drawn, and Sobers took one wicket in the Australians&#x27; only innings, before scoring 11 in the West Indies second innings. The home team were again defeated in the fifth and final Test in Jamaica. Sobers performed with the bat, however, scoring 35 not out and 64.

Sobers went on his first overseas tour in the early months of 1956 when, aged 19, he was part of the West Indian tour of New Zealand. The series was not successful personally for Sobers, who struggled on the foreign batting wickets. West Indies pitches had little or no grass, while in New Zealand the pitches were green. &quot;I took one look and asked myself how I could possibly bat on that? How could I make runs? I was out before I even walked to the crease,&quot; Sobers later wrote. Playing in all four Tests, he totalled 81 runs and two wickets.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS Sobers / Test matches/ All-round records / Series averages&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As a batsman, Sobers needed time to develop at Test level and, in nine Tests as a teenager, he scored only one half century, and averaged 29.33 with the bat.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS Sobers / Test matches / Cumulative averages&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Sobers was sent home from New Zealand early to play an unofficial Test match against an England team that included feared fast-bowler Frank Tyson. After struggling to cope with Tyson&#x27;s pace, Sobers managed to score a half-century, raising hope that he would be selected for the upcoming tour to England, something he considered unlikely after his lack of form. In the first trial match to help select the squad for the upcoming tour, Sobers scored a century in Trinidad. The matches also saw Sobers get his first look at West Indian cricket politics. Wes Hall and Frank Mason were competing for a single place in the touring party, and Sobers and Everton Weekes decided they &quot;would take on Mason and knock him out of the firing line to try and get our fellow Bajan (countryman) Wes in the team.&quot; The pair attacked Mason, while they defended Hall in a tactic that paid off with Hall selected, despite Sobers believing Mason was the better bowler at the time.

Sobers toured England for their summer in 1957. He played his first match against the Jim Swanton XI in April, and was surprised about how cold the conditions were, often causing him to wear two or three jumpers.
His performances with the bat throughout the five Test series were classed as mediocre, scoring 320 runs at 32, with three half centuries. On the bowling front, Sobers struggled, taking five wickets at 71. It was in the final Test at The Oval that Sobers gained the attention of critics with defiant batting amid a disappointing team performance. The condition of the pitch was subject to criticism and described by &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; as &quot;a strange sight&quot;. After England had scored 412, the West Indies were easily dismissed for 89 and 86 by the Surrey spinners Jim Laker and Tony Lock, who were playing on their home ground. Batting at number 3, Sobers made 39 and 42, while none of his colleagues passed 30 in either innings. In its summary of the tour, &quot;Wisden&quot; said: &quot;(of the newcomers) Collie Smith, Sobers, Rohan Kanhai and Roy Gilchrist were particularly impressive&quot;; adding that &quot;to Sobers, a tall left-handed all-rounder, fell the distinction of hitting the highest score of the tour: 219 not out against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. Sobers undoubtedly was a very fine stroke-player who should go far&quot;.

===1958–1964: 365 not out===

At this stage of his career, Sobers had frustrated his admirers by failing to convert good starts into high scores. He had reached double figures in 18 of his 22 Test innings, although his highest score was still only 66. But, in the three years following the 1957 tour, he fulfilled his promise. In his next 24 Tests, he scored 2,250 runs at the exceptionally high average of 93.75. In 1958, he scored his maiden Test century against Pakistan in Kingston and expanded it to an unbeaten 365, breaking the world record Test score of 364 set by England&#x27;s Len Hutton in 1938. Sobers batted for 614 minutes and scored 38 fours but, unusually in such a large total, no sixes. At 21 years and 216 days, he is the youngest player to break the individual scoring record in Tests, and remains the youngest triple-centurion. Sir Garfield Sobers set the world records for the highest maiden test ton (365*) as well as becoming the first batsman in test history to convert his maiden test ton into a triple ton. He made 824 runs with three centuries in the five Tests against Pakistan, and followed this with 557 runs and three more centuries on the West Indies tour of India in 1958–59. Sobers underwent trauma following the death of Collie Smith in September 1959, but he continued to play cricket successfully. In the home Test series against England in 1959–60, he scored three centuries in five matches, totalling 709 runs.

Largely inspired by new West Indies captain Sir Frank Worrell, who was a close personal friend, Sobers had an outstanding 1960–61 series in Australia. He scored a celebrated 132 on the first day of the First Test at Brisbane Cricket Ground, the match which resulted in the first Tied Test. &quot;Wisden&quot; confirmed that &quot;some observers considered it the best hundred they had ever seen&quot;. Sobers scored 430 runs in the series, which Australia won 2–1, with two centuries; his fielding was outstanding and he took 12 catches. He felt he had &quot;had a good series, starting badly but then coming on&quot; and a very positive outcome for him was to receive an invitation from Don Bradman to play for South Australia in 1961–62.

Sobers took 15 wickets in the 1960–61 series, including a best analysis of 5/120, at an average of 39.20, and his bowling allowed Worrell to play an extra batsman in the final three Tests, thus using Sobers for the first time as a designated all-rounder, a role in which he became the dominant player in world cricket over the next decade, being awarded the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World title (retrospectively) eight times in 13 years. Sobers was never a prolific wicket-taker in Test cricket, and his average of three wickets per game in this series typified his whole career. Overall, he took 235 wickets in his 93 Tests at an average of 34.03 and was more effective when operating as a pace bowler. His best performance was 6/73 and, although he achieved five wickets in an innings six times, he never took ten in a match.

His success continued in the next two series at home to India in 1961–62 and away to England in 1963. He was elected Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1964, and then succeeded Worrell, who had retired, as West Indies captain for the 1964–65 home series against Australia.

===1965–1974: West Indies captaincy===

Sobers enjoyed immediate success as West Indies captain when his team defeated Australia by 179 runs in the First Test at Sabina Park. West Indies went on to win the series 2–1 and so claim the new Frank Worrell Trophy. This was the first time West Indies had beaten Australia in a Test series.

He enjoyed spectacular success in England in 1966 and was widely acclaimed as &quot;King Cricket&quot;. In the five Tests he scored 722 runs at an average of 103.14 with three centuries, and had 20 wickets at 27.25, as well as taking 10 catches. West Indies won the series 3–1, with one match drawn. His status was celebrated at that time by the Trinidadian calypso artist Mighty Sparrow, with his song &quot;Sir Garfield Sobers&quot;.

In 1966–67, Sobers captained the West Indies team to India in 1966–67 and they won the series 2–0 with one match drawn.

He lost a series for the first time in 1967–68 when West Indies were surprisingly beaten at home by England. Four matches were drawn and England won the Fourth Test at Queen&#x27;s Park Oval following a controversial declaration by Sobers which enabled England to score the necessary 215–3 to win at just four runs an over.

In 1968–69, Sobers captained the West Indian cricket team in Australia in 1968-69 but they lost the series 3–1 and then drew a three-Test series in New Zealand 1–1.

In 1969, West Indies lost 2–0 in England with one match drawn.

Sobers captained West Indies for the five-Test home series versus India in 1970–71. India won the series 1–0 with four matches drawn. A year later, Sobers led West Indies in five home Tests against New Zealand and all five were drawn.

Sobers was succeeded as West Indies captain by Rohan Kanhai for the 1972–73 home series against Australia. Sobers did not play in that series but returned to play under Kanhai in England in 1973. He played his last Test in March 1974 at Queen&#x27;s Park Oval against England.

===Rest of the World XI===

When South Africa were banned from international cricket because of the country&#x27;s apartheid policy, South Africa&#x27;s two lucrative tours to England in 1970 and to Australia in 1971–72 were cancelled. The cricket authorities responded by forming a Rest of the World team to play two unofficial Test series instead, and these teams included some leading South African players. Sobers was invited to captain the Rest of the World XI in England and a World XI in Australia.

In 1970, captaining the Rest of the World XI against England, he took 6/21 on the opening day of the First unofficial Test at Lord&#x27;s with pace bowling, the ball swinging and seaming at high speed. He then scored &quot;a magnificent&quot; 183 and helped bowl out England in the second innings using his left arm wrist spin. In the Fourth Test at Headingley, Sobers scored 114 and 59 as his team won by two wickets. Following the Rest of the World series, he outraged many in the West Indies by playing in a friendly double-wicket tournament in Rhodesia in September 1970.

In January 1972, in the third unofficial Test between Australia and The World XI at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Sobers played an innings of 254 which was described by Don Bradman as &quot;probably the greatest exhibition of batting ever seen in Australia&quot;. Australian captain Ian Chappell also rates the innings as the best innings he ever saw.

He reached his century in 129 balls and after a rest day, reached 254 in 326 balls. It was &quot;one of the most magnificent innings seen on the Melbourne Cricket Ground&quot; and his &quot;superb display of forceful cricket&quot; lasted 376 minutes and included two sixes and 33 fours.

Sobers wrote in his autobiography that these two &quot;unofficial&quot; series should be given full &quot;Test&quot; status due to the quality of the players involved.

==League cricket in England==

Sobers spent several seasons in English league cricket. Having completed his first tour of England with West Indies in 1957, he followed the advice of his mentor Frank Worrell and became the professional at Radcliffe Cricket Club in the Central Lancashire League, staying for five seasons from 1958 to 1962. This experience enabled him to hone his skills in varying conditions and Sobers says that playing in the league furthered his cricket education. He enjoyed considerable success at Radcliffe. In 1961, he achieved a rare &quot;double&quot; by scoring 1008 runs and taking 144 wickets, his performances being instrumental in Radcliffe winning both the league&#x27;s championship title and its supplementary Wood Cup competition.

While he was engaged at Radcliffe, Sobers underwent emotional trauma after a road accident in September 1959 on the A34 near Stoke-on-Trent which resulted in Collie Smith&#x27;s death. Sobers was driving a car in which Smith and another West Indian Test player Tom Dewdney were passengers. Smith&#x27;s back was broken by the collision and he died three days later. Sobers could not recall much about the crash and was fined £10 for driving without due care and attention. He &quot;began drinking more&quot; and there were concerns, expressed by himself and others, that the experience might affect his cricket career. He got over the trauma by deciding that he would be letting his country down if he &quot;disappeared into the mists of an alcoholic haze&quot; and he resolved to play not just for Garfield Sobers but for Collie Smith as well, thus setting himself the task of playing for two men. He recovered well and, after an outstanding home Test series against England in 1959–60, he returned to Radcliffe where he continued as club professional for the next three seasons.

Sobers gives an insight into the life of the club professional in his autobiography. He was paid £500 a season by Radcliffe. That was a reasonable wage but he relied on matchday collections to augment it and a good performance would boost the collection. He sometimes received as much as £50 in a collection and &quot;that represented a massive bonus&quot;. Radcliffe placed no restrictions on him and, when they had no game, he could play as a guest professional in other leagues throughout Lancashire and Yorkshire. He particularly liked playing in Yorkshire when he could because they would pay him £25 per appearance with a collection on top if he did well.

After touring England with West Indies in 1963, he moved to the North Staffordshire and South Cheshire League in 1964 to play for Norton Cricket Club, who duly won the league title. Sobers made 549 runs in 18 innings at 49.90, finishing second in the league averages behind only his amateur brother Gerald, also playing for Norton, who averaged 50.12. Gary Sobers did even better with the ball, his 97 wickets at 8.38 heading the league averages. 1965 saw a repeat performance with Norton again winning the league and, though Sobers only averaged 25.38 with the bat, he again topped the league bowling averages with 76 wickets at 8.03. Norton lost the league title in 1966 while Sobers was touring England with West Indies but regained it in 1967 when he returned. He was fourth in the 1967 league batting averages with 41.83 and third in the bowling with 95 wickets at 9.37 (the two bowlers with better averages took only 22 and 24 wickets).

==Sheffield Shield with South Australia==

In the 1961–62 Australian season which followed the 1960–61 West Indies tour, Sobers and his West Indian colleagues Wes Hall and Rohan Kanhai returned to Australia to take part in the Sheffield Shield. Sobers played for South Australia and had an enormous impact on attendances, causing an 89% increase with gate receipts rising &quot;by two and a half times&quot;. He topped both the batting and bowling averages at South Australia, his best performance being against champions New South Wales at the Adelaide Oval when he scored 251 and took 3/51 and 6/72.

He was even more outstanding in 1963–64 when, largely due to his efforts, South Australia won the Sheffield Shield. Sobers was the season&#x27;s leading runscorer with 973 at 74.84 and the leading wicket taker with 47 at 28.27.

Sobers spent three seasons with South Australia and in two he achieved the rare double of 1000 runs and 50 wickets.

==Shell Shield with Barbados==

Sobers played intermittently for Barbados throughout his first-class career. He made his first appearance in the inaugural season of the new Shell Shield competition in February 1966. His last appearance for Barbados came in the 1973–74 Shell Shield match against Jamaica, at Kensington Oval.

==County Championship with Nottinghamshire==

At the end of the 1967 English cricket season, it was agreed that each county club could immediately sign a non-English player for the 1968 season. Seven clubs approached Sobers and, on 14 December 1967, Nottinghamshire announced that he had signed for them and had been appointed club captain. Sobers stated that, although he had enjoyed his time in league cricket, he had a definite preference for the first-class game and he looked forward to restoring Nottinghamshire&#x27;s fortunes. Though details were undisclosed, &quot;Wisden 1968&quot; speculated that his contract would run for three years and be worth £7000 a year (a very high income at the time), including an apartment and a car.

===Six sixes in an over===

On 31 August 1968, Sobers became the first batsman ever to hit six sixes in a single over of six consecutive balls in first-class cricket. Sobers hit the first four balls cleanly out of the ground but was caught on his fifth attempt by Roger Davis on the boundary at long-off. However, while doing so, Davis fell on his back and landed on the line. Umpire Eddie Phillipson ruled that Davis had carried the ball over the boundary and signalled six. Sobers then smashed the next ball—the sixth ball of the over—clean over the East Terrace of the St. Helen&#x27;s Cricket Ground. As commentator Wilf Wooller put it: &quot;And he’s done it! He’s done it! And my goodness, it’s gone ... way down to Swansea!&quot; Sobers was playing as captain of Nottinghamshire against Glamorgan at St. Helen&#x27;s in Swansea; the unfortunate bowler was Malcolm Nash. This tally of 36 runs in an over broke a 57-year-old record of 34 runs, held by Ted Alletson. The ball was collected from a garden by 11-year-old Richard Lewis; he later gave the ball to Sobers. In 1984–85, Indian batsman Ravi Shastri equalled the record by scoring six sixes in an over while playing for Bombay versus Baroda.

==Style and technique==

An outstanding all-rounder, Sobers was left-handed as both batsman and bowler. His versatility enabled him to bowl all varieties of left-arm bowling from spin to fast-medium. As a fielder he was usually stationed close to the wicket but he was also a very capable outfielder.

In a 1988 interview with Norman May, the great Australian batsman and cricket administrator Sir Donald Bradman described Sobers as the best all rounder he ever saw, and gave this assessment of his style and technique:

Richie Benaud described Sobers as &quot;the greatest all-round cricketer the world has seen&quot;. Benaud wrote, &quot;Sobers was a brilliant batsman, splendid fielder, particularly close to the wicket, and a bowler of extraordinary skill, whether bowling with the new ball, providing orthodox left-arm spin or over-the-wrist spin&quot;.

Fred Trueman enjoyed a great rivalry with Sobers and later described him as a &quot;sublime left-hand batsman&quot; who was &quot;one of the greatest cricketers ever to have graced the game, certainly the greatest all-rounder&quot;. Trueman went on to say that Sobers as a batsman &quot;has a great cricketing brain and his thought processes are lightning quick&quot;.

C. L. R. James, when describing the batsmanship of Wilton St Hill, commented upon St Hill&#x27;s ability to judge the ball early in its flight and so quickly decide which stroke to play. In James&#x27;s view, only Sir Don Bradman and Sobers were comparable with St Hill in having this capability of &quot;seeing&quot; the ball. &quot;Wisden 1969&quot; described the &quot;lightning footwork&quot; of Sobers as he got into position for his stroke. Commenting upon Sobers&#x27;s six sixes in an over against his team in 1968, Glamorgan captain Tony Lewis said: &quot;It was not sheer slogging through strength, but scientific hitting with every movement working in harmony.&quot;

As a bowler, Sobers began as an orthodox left arm spinner (SLA) and later developed the ability to bowl left arm wrist spin and googlies. Sobers could also operate as a seamer, sometimes using medium pace, but he was much more effective when he bowled fast. With the new ball, he could make the delivery curve late in flight at high speed; his action being a loose, springy run followed by a &quot;whiplash&quot; delivery.

Though he mostly fielded close to the wicket, Sobers was an exceptional outfielder who was seen on one occasion, when he had fielded the ball on the boundary, to &quot;bend his hand back almost parallel with his arm before flipping the ball a full seventy yards to the wicketkeeper&quot;.

Following his success as captain of West Indies on the 1966 tour of England, the 1967 edition of &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; declared that for Sobers &quot;(the 1966 Tests) were one triumph after another with bat and ball, as well as in the field as a master tactician and fantastic catcher close to the bat&quot;. Sobers&#x27;s exploits in 1966 earned him the media-bestowed sobriquet of &quot;King Cricket&quot;, which soon afterwards became the title of a book about him.

==Football Career==
Sobers was a natural athlete and played football at a competitive level in Barbados, primarily as a left-back (defender). His physical strength, tactical awareness, and athleticism made him a formidable player.

His most notable football achievement came when he was selected to play for Barbados in an international match against Martinique in the 1950s. In this match, Sobers helped his team to a 2-0 victory, scoring one of the goals — a rare feat for a defender.

Sobers remains one of the few athletes to have represented his country internationally in two sports. His brief but successful stint in football, capped by a goal-scoring international match, adds another layer to his sporting legacy.

==Personal life==

Sobers was briefly engaged to Indian actress Anju Mahendru after he met her on the 1966–67 tour of India. He married Prudence &quot;Pru&quot; Kirby, an Australian, in September 1969. They had two sons, Matthew and Daniel, and an adopted daughter, Genevieve. The marriage ended in divorce in 1990 after the couple broke up in 1984; however, Sobers acquired dual Australian citizenship through marriage in 1980.

He says that his was a multi-sporting family who were all good at football, basketball, table tennis and tennis. His own favourite sport is golf and he has been an enthusiastic gambler. He is the author of a children&#x27;s novel about cricket, &quot;Bonaventure and the Flashing Blade&quot;, in which computer analysis helps a university cricket team become unbeatable.

In 2021, Sobers expressed his opposition to the constitutional change made by the government of Barbados to become a republic and abolish the monarchy of Barbados.

==Honours and legacy==

In the 1975 New Year Honours, Queen Elizabeth II created Sobers a Knight Bachelor for his services to cricket. The award was made in the British Diplomatic and Overseas section of the list, rather than on the nomination of the Government of Barbados, which had stopped putting forward recommendations for British honours. This caused the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office some unease, as shown by papers released by The National Archives in 2005. However, since Barbados had not yet introduced its own system of honours, the Prime Minister of Barbados was pleased that an honour would be forthcoming for Sobers.

The award was originally intended to be made in the 1975 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, but since there was a royal visit to Barbados planned for February 1975, it was moved forward to the New Year list so that Sobers could be knighted by the Queen in person during the visit. The very short turnaround between the decision to make the award and its announcement meant that the Governor-General of Barbados was not informed of the award before the public announcement, which caused some hurt feelings between London and Bridgetown.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1975 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews while attending a reception at the Barbadian High Commission in London to celebrate his recent knighthood.

Sobers was made a National Hero of Barbados by the Cabinet of Barbados in 1998 and is thus accorded the honorary prefix &quot;The Right Excellent&quot;. He is one of only eleven people to have received this honour and one of two recipients still living, along with Rihanna.

Sobers coached internationally, having a one-time stint with Sri Lanka. In 2003 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia, where he had played many first-class games for South Australia.

==Cricket awards==

Among the awards that Sobers won during his playing career were:

* &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketer of the Year: 1964
* The Cricket Society Wetherall Award for the Leading All-Rounder in English First-Class Cricket: 1970
* Walter Lawrence Trophy winner: 1974
* &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketer of the Century: 2000

In 2000, Sobers was named by a 100-member panel of experts as one of the five &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketers of the Century. He received 90 votes out of a possible 100. The other four cricketers selected for the honour were Don Bradman (100 votes), Jack Hobbs (30), Shane Warne (27) and Viv Richards (25).

In 2004, the International Cricket Council (ICC) inaugurated the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy which is awarded annually to the player selected by ICC as its Player of the Year. The recommendation to name the award after Sobers was made by a panel consisting of Richie Benaud, Sunil Gavaskar and Michael Holding, who were asked by the ICC &quot;to select an individual with whom to honour cricket&#x27;s ultimate individual award&quot;.

In 2007 &quot;Wisden&quot; retrospectively selected the Leading Cricketer in the World for every year dating back to 1900 (except 1915–18 and 1940–45), Sobers being selected for eight years (1958, 1960, 1962, 1964–66, 1968 and 1970). Only Sobers and Bradman (10) received the accolade more than three times.

To mark 150 years of the Cricketers&#x27; Almanack, &quot;Wisden&quot; named him in an all-time Test World XI.

<text>William Oldys (14 July 1696 – 15 April 1761) was an English antiquarian and bibliographer.

==Life==
He was probably born in London, the illegitimate son of Dr William Oldys (1636–1708), chancellor of Lincoln diocese. His father had held the office of advocate of the admiralty, but lost it in 1693 because he would not prosecute as traitors and pirates the sailors who had served against England under James II.

William Oldys, the younger, lost part of his small patrimony in the South Sea Bubble, and in 1724 went to Yorkshire, spending the greater part of the next six years as the guest of the Earl of Malton. On his return to London he found that his landlord had disposed of the books and papers left in his charge. Among these was an annotated copy of Gerard Langbaine&#x27;s &quot;Dramatick Poets&quot;. The book came into the hands of Thomas Coxeter, and subsequently into those of Theophilus Cibber, furnishing the basis of the &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot; (1753) published with Cibber&#x27;s name on the title page (though most of it was written by Robert Shiels).

In 1731 Oldys sold his collections to Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, who appointed him his literary secretary in 1738. Three years later Harley died, and from that time Oldys worked for the booksellers. His habits were irregular, and in 1751 his debts drove him to the Fleet prison. After two years&#x27; imprisonment he was released through the kindness of friends who paid his debts.

In April 1755, he was appointed Norfolk Herald Extraordinary and then Norroy King of Arms by the Duke of Norfolk. According to the current College of Arms, Oldys was, &quot;a noted antiquary and bibliographer but wholly ignorant of heraldry and known for being &#x27;rarely sober in the afternoon, never after supper&#x27;, and &#x27;much addicted to low company.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;The British Muse&quot;, one of the earliest poetry anthologies to appear in Britain, was published in 1738. From 1747 to 1760, Oldys contributed twenty-two articles to the &quot;Biographia Britannica&quot;.

==Family==
Oldys&#x27; father, Dr William Oldys (1636–1708), was the son of Rev. William Oldys (1591–1645), who had been murdered in Adderbury, Oxford by Parliamentarian soldiers. The account of his murder tells of how he was hunted all day due to his support of the monarchy and even though he threw down money to distract the closing pack, he was run through with a sword and died. The church bell in Adderbury still bears his name and on the wall of the vestry is a plaque written in Latin describing that dreadful day 15 September 1645. His wife Margaret née Sacheverell died 7 May 1705. She was the daughter of Ambrose Sacheverell, the Reverend at Tadmarton in 1617.

Rev. William Oldys was the son of John Oldys b. 13 July 1563 who was son of John Oldys b.1520 who was son of John Oldys, Bishop of Clonmacnoise, Ireland in 1444 who was son of Richard Oldys b. 1366.
The details of this can be found in the British Library Addit 4240. Diary of Birch. MJA

<doc id="302958" wikidata="Q3101849" url="?curid=302958" title="George Puttenham">
<text>George Puttenham (1529–1590) was an English writer and literary critic. He is generally considered to be the author of the influential handbook on poetry and rhetoric, &quot;The Arte of English Poesie&quot; (1589).

==Family and early life==
Puttenham was the second son of Robert Puttenham of Sherfield-on-Loddon in Hampshire and his wife Margaret, the daughter of Sir Richard Elyot and sister of Sir Thomas Elyot. He had an elder brother, Richard. He matriculated at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in November 1546, aged 17, but took no degree, and was admitted to the Middle Temple on 11 August 1556.

In late 1559 or early 1560 Puttenham married Elizabeth, Lady Windsor (1520–1588), the daughter and coheir of Peter Cowdray of Herriard, Hampshire. She was the widow of both Richard, brother of William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester, and William, Baron Windsor. She brought a substantial dowry to the marriage. They had at least one daughter.

Somewhere around 1562, Puttenham travelled abroad to purchase Sherfield House from his elder brother Richard. He immediately quarrelled at Sherfield House with Lady Windsor&#x27;s brother-in-law, Thomas Paulet, for inciting others to steal a goshawk from him; Paulet admitting to having confronted Puttenham with a dagger and wounding him twice. His circle of enemies notedly widened when Lady Windsor separated from him, suing him for divorce in 1566.

==Domestic disputes and later legal troubles==
Much of the information known about Puttenham&#x27;s later personal and professional life stems from court records of the dissolution of his marriage and of his attempt to get out of debt by wresting control of Sherfield House from his niece Anne Morris and her husband, Francis. These documents paint a troubled picture of Puttenham as a compulsive adulterer, a serial rapist and a wife-beater. In addition he seems to have followed his elder brother&#x27;s precedent in having at least one child with his maidservants. One he took to Flanders and abandoned. One of the more lascivious stories asserts that when Puttenham was forty-three, he had his servant kidnap a 17-year-old girl in London and bring her to his farm at Upton Grey near Sherfield, where he raped her and kept her locked up for three years.

While the veracity of these court records should reasonably be questioned (given the particularly nasty nature of Puttenham&#x27;s divorce and the tendency of early modern court cases to present the most fantastical accounts of their participants), surprisingly little was said in defence of Puttenham&#x27;s character. It is, perhaps, telling that the neutral observer Richard Horne, Bishop of Winchester, reacted with surprise and disdain to Puttenham&#x27;s appointment as a Justice of the Peace, writing to William Cecil, Lord Burghley, hoping that it &quot;be not true, for his evil life is well knowne.&quot;

In 1579 he presented to Elizabeth I his &quot;Partheniades&quot; (printed in a collection of manuscript &quot;Ballads&quot; by F. J. Furnivall), and he wrote the treatise in question especially for the delectation of the queen and her ladies. He mentions nine other works of his, none of which are extant. Puttenham is said to have been implicated in a plot against Lord Burghley in 1570 and in December 1578 was imprisoned. In 1585 he received reparation from the privy council for alleged wrongs suffered at the hands of his relations. His will is dated 1 September 1590.

==Authorship of &quot;The Arte of English Poesie&quot;==
&quot;The Arte of English Poesie&quot; was entered at Stationers&#x27; Hall in 1588, and published in the following year with a dedicatory letter to Lord Burghley written by the printer Richard Field, who professed ignorance of the writer&#x27;s name and position. However, alterations to the text made during the press run indicate that the author must have been alive and that Field must have known his identity. The first reference to the work was made in the preface to Sir John Harrington&#x27;s translation of &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; (1591) in reaction to Puttenham&#x27;s view of translators as mere versifiers. Harrington disparages Puttenham&#x27;s assertion that poetry is an art rather than a gift, holding up Puttenham&#x27;s own poetry as proof because &quot;he sheweth himself so slender a gift in it.&quot; Although Harrington does not name Puttenham, in a surviving manuscript note concerning the publication of his own book, he asks Field to publish it &quot;in the same print that Putnams book is&quot;, which he did.

In an essay published in the second edition of William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Remaines&quot; (1614), Richard Carew writes, &quot;look into our Imitations of all sorts of verses by any other language, and you shall finde that &quot;Sir Phillip Sidney&quot;, Maister &quot;Puttenham&quot;, Maister &quot;Stanihurst&quot;, and divers more have made use how farre wee are within compasse of a fore imagined impossibility in that behalfe&quot;. Around the same time, in his &quot;Hypercritica&quot; (not published until 1722), Edmund Bolton writes of &quot;the elegant, witty, and artificial book of the &quot;Art of English Poetrie&quot;, (the work as the fame is) of one of [Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s] Gentleman Pensioners, Puttenham&quot;. Since Puttenham received two leases in reversion from the queen in 1588, this seems to clearly identify him as the author.

Certain biographical details in &quot;The Arte&quot; may point to a Puttenham as the author. He was educated at Oxford, and at the age of 18 he addressed an eclogue entitled &quot;Elpine&quot; to Edward VI. In his youth he had visited Spain, France, and Italy, and was better acquainted with foreign courts than with his own.

There is no direct evidence beyond Bolton&#x27;s ascription to identify the author with George or Richard Puttenham, the sons of Robert Puttenham and his wife Margaret, the sister of Sir Thomas Elyot, who dedicated his treatise on the &quot;Education or Bringing up of Children&quot; to her for the benefit of her sons. Furthermore, since Bolton&#x27;s ascription occurs 15 years after George&#x27;s death and four after Richard&#x27;s neither man would have been able to either accept or reject the attribution. Both made unhappy marriages, were constantly engaged in litigation, and were frequently in disgrace. One fact that points towards George&#x27;s authorship is that Richard was in prison when the book was licensed to be printed, and when he made his will in 1597 he was in the Queen&#x27;s Bench Prison. He was buried, according to John Payne Collier, at St. Clement Danes, London, on 2 July 1601. Richard Puttenham is known to have spent much of his time abroad, whereas George is only known to have left England a single time, to get the deed for Sherfield House from his brother. This agrees better with the writer&#x27;s account of himself; but if the statement that he addressed &quot;Elpine&quot; to Edward VI when he was 18 years of age be taken to imply that the production of this work fell within that king&#x27;s reign, the date of the author&#x27;s birth cannot be placed anterior to 1529. At the date (1546) of his inheritance of his uncle, Sir Thomas Elyot&#x27;s estates, Richard Puttenham was proved in an inquisition held at Newmarket to have been twenty-six years old. The history of the Puttenhams is discussed in H. H. S. Croft&#x27;s edition of &quot;Elyot&#x27;s Boke&quot; called the &quot;Cover nour&quot;. A careful investigation brought him to the conclusion that the evidence was in favour of Richard. There are other modern editions of the book, notably one in Joseph Haslewood&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Critical Essays&quot; (1811–1815). For editions with critical apparatus see Willcock and Walker&#x27;s Cambridge edition of 1936 and Whigham and Rebhorn&#x27;s new critical edition (Cornell UP, 2007).

==&quot;The Arte of English Poesie&quot;==
Whoever the author may have been, there is no doubt about the importance of the work, which is the most systematic and comprehensive treatise of the time on its subject. It is &quot;contrived into three books: the first of poets and poesies, the second of proportion, the third of ornament.&quot; Puttenham&#x27;s book covers a general history of the art of poetry, and a discussion of the various forms of poetry; the second treats of prosody, dealing in turn with the measures in use in English verse, the caesura, punctuation, rhyme, accent, cadence, proportion in figure, which the author illustrates by geometrical diagrams, and the proposed innovations of English quantitative verse; the section on ornament deals with style, the distinctions between written and spoken language, the figures of speech; and the author closes with lengthy observations on good manners. He deprecates the use of archaisms, and although he allows that the purer Saxon speech is spoken beyond the Trent, he advises the English writer to take as his model the usual speech of the court, of London and the home counties.

Book I, &quot;Of Poets and Poesie&quot;, contains a remarkably credible history of poetry in Greek, Latin and in English. All subjects, including science and law, were in primitive times written in verse, and the types of poetry number in the dozens. Because it is decorated with versification and figures of speech, poetry is a more persuasive and melodious form of language, and is very much given to structure and accuracy. The countless examples of dignities and promotions given to poets throughout history, and the numerous examples of royal poets, show up the ignorance of Renaissance courtiers who suppress their poetry or publish under a pseudonym.

In Book II, &quot;Of Proportion Poetical&quot;, Puttenham compares metrical form to arithmetical, geometrical, and musical pattern. He adduces five points to English verse structure: the &quot;Staffe&quot;, the &quot;Measure&quot;, &quot;Concord or Symphony&quot;, &quot;Situation&quot; and &quot;Figure&quot;.

The staff, or stanza, is four to ten lines that join without intermission and finish up all of the sentences thereof. Each length of stanza suits a poetic tone and genre. Each is overlaid by a closed rhyme scheme. This latter, termed &quot;band&quot; (65) and &quot;enterlacement&quot; (70), is of primary concern to Puttenham. He views English as having solely a syllabic system of measure, or metre. The length of lines may alternate in patterns that support the rhyme scheme, and so increase the band. Syllabic length is a factor but accentuation is not. Caesura should occur at the same place in every line; it helps to keep up distinctness and clarity, two virtues of civil language.

&quot;Concord, called Symphonie or rime&quot; (76) is an accommodation made for the lack of metrical feet in English versification. The matching of line lengths, rhymed at the end, in symmetrical patterns, is a further accommodation. A number of graphs are shown to illustrate the variety of rhyme schemes and line-length patterns, or situation. The poet who can work melodiously within the strictures of versification proves a &quot;crafts master&quot;, a valuable literary virtue. Proportion in figure is the composition of stanzas in graphic forms ranging from the rhombus to the spire.

Book III, &quot;Of Ornament&quot;, which comprises a full half of the &quot;Arte&quot;, is a catalogue of figures of speech, in the tradition of Richard Sherry, Henry Peacham, Abraham Fraunce and Angel Day. Since language is inherently artificial, and &quot;not naturall to man&quot; (120), the added artifice of figures is particularly suitable. Figures give more &quot;pithe and substance, subtilitie, quicknesse, efficacie or moderation, in this or that sort tuning and tempring them by amplification, abridgement, opening, closing, enforcing, meekening or otherwise disposing them to the best purpose ...&quot; (134). From page 136 to 225, Puttenham lists and analyses figures of speech. His book concludes with a lengthy analysis of &quot;decency&quot;, and the artificial and natural dimensions of language.

==Influence of &quot;The Arte of English Poesie&quot;==
Many later &quot;poetics&quot; are indebted to this book. The original edition is very rare. Edward Arber&#x27;s reprint (1869) contains a clear summary of the various documents with regard to the authorship of this treatise. According to Puttenham, presumptive author of &quot;The Arte of English Poesie&quot;, Sir Thomas Wyatt and Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, &quot;trauailed into Italie&quot; (49) and brought back the verse forms that make them &quot;the first reformers of our English meter and stile&quot; (49). The introduction of these new Italian forms in turn necessitated the flurry of Renaissance poetry manuals, by George Gascoigne, Samuel Daniel, Charles Webb and Sir Philip Sidney, in addition to Puttenham&#x27;s &quot;Arte&quot;. There is currently debate about Puttenham&#x27;s relative authority in comparison to these other figures.

<text>:&quot;This is an article about the 17th-century poet. For the reality TV participant, see Beauty and the Geek (UK TV series)&quot;

Edmund Mary Bolton () was an English historian and poet who was born, by his own account, in 1575.

==Life==
Nothing is known of his family or origins, although he referred to himself as a distant relative of George Villiers. Brought up a Roman Catholic, he was educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Bolton then lived in London at the Inner Temple. Both at Cambridge and in London, he participated in the literary life of the time. At Cambridge, he met John Selden, John Coke, and others. In London, he wrote occasional verse, contributing poems to &quot;England&#x27;s Helicon&quot;, and commendatory verses to William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; and Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Volpone&quot;. He became a retainer of Villiers, and through the Duke&#x27;s influence, Bolton secured a small place at the court of James I. Bolton married Margaret Porter, the sister of Endymion Porter, another of the Duke&#x27;s retinue and a minor poet.

Throughout his life, Bolton was oppressed by poverty, about which he freely informed his numerous prospective patrons. These included, at one time or another, Cecil, Henry Howard, and even Edward Alleyn. He was caught up in Charles&#x27;s campaign against recusancy in 1628; he was imprisoned first in the Fleet Prison and then in the Marshalsea, where he languished for want of a person of power to intercede for him.

Bolton was still living in 1633, but appears to have died that year or shortly after.

==Proposed Academy==
With the support of Villiers, Bolton advanced a scheme for an English Academy. He proposed a three-part structure. The academy would include learned aristocrats as auxiliary members, and the Lord Chancellor and the two university chancellors as &quot;tutelaries&quot;; but the heart of the enterprise was to be the group of &quot;essentials&quot; who would carry on the work of licensing publications that did not fall under the purview of the Archbishop of Canterbury and advancing antiquarian and historical study. James seems to have approved of the proposal, but the plan died with that king.

==Works==
One of the most important of his numerous works is &quot;Hypercritica&quot;, a short critical treatise begun about 1618 but not finished till 1621 (a date establishable by examination of its manuscript in the Bodleian Library, which refers to Bolton&#x27;s contemporary Francis Bacon as Viscount St Alban, a title Bacon acquired in that year). This is valuable for its notices of contemporary authors such as Ben Jonson, whom he praises as the greatest English poet; this manuscript was reprinted in Joseph Haslewood&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Critical Essays&quot; (vol. ii., 1815). Another important work of his is &quot;Nero Caesar, or Monarchie Depraved&quot; (1624), which takes special note of British affairs. Unsurprisingly, Bolton praised the virtues of a strong monarchy and asserted the horror of any rebellion, even against unjust authority. In the preface, Bolton hints that James had encouraged the work, and the language of the whole text is a more or less evident bid for the patronage of Charles I. The bid failed.

&quot;Hypercritica&quot; was a kind of prolegomenon to Bolton&#x27;s most ambitious project, never completed: an updated history of Britain based on archives and other original sources, free of both the cant of medieval historians and the clumsiness of Tudor chroniclers such as Stow. Like the Academy, this work never materialized, though Bolton continued to work on related projects throughout his life. A surviving contents-list includes a projected chapter on &quot;Joseph of Arimathea and the Abbie of Glastenberie&quot;, which raises the interesting possibility that Bolton might have been intending to use this controversial figure in a bid to reconcile Protestant and Catholic antiquarian narratives. In the early 1630s, he attempted to interest London&#x27;s city government in an updated history of the city in English and Latin. After some initial interest, the aldermen balked at the cost (more than 3000 pounds). Shortly before his death, Bolton gave the manuscript to Selden; it is now lost. Also was thought lost a companion to the work on Nero, a biography of Tiberius. But it was bought by Aprosio, a collector from Ventimiglia, in the 17th century and then sold to the bibliophile Giacomo Filippo Durazzo; it is now part of the Durazziana.

<text>Test cricket is played between international cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Unlike One Day Internationals, Test matches consist of two innings per team, with no limit in the number of overs. Test cricket is first-class cricket, so statistics and records set in Test matches are also counted toward first-class records. The duration of Tests, currently limited to five days, has varied through Test history, ranging from three days to timeless matches. The earliest match now recognised as a Test was played between England and Australia in March 1877; since then there have been over 2,000 Tests played by 13 teams. The frequency of Tests has steadily increased partly because of the increase in the number of Test-playing countries, and partly as cricket boards seek to maximise their revenue.

Cricket is, by its nature, capable of generating large numbers of records and statistics. This list details the most significant team and individual records in Test cricket.

, the most successful team in Test cricket, in terms of both wins and win percentage, is Australia, having won 414 of their 866 Tests (47.80%). Excluding teams who have only played a small number of Tests, the least successful team is Zimbabwe.

Australian Donald Bradman, widely considered the greatest batsman of all time, holds several personal and partnership records. He scored the most runs in a series, has the most double centuries and was a part of the record 5th wicket partnership. His most significant record is his batting average of 99.94. One of cricket&#x27;s most famous statistics, it still stands almost 40 runs higher than any other batsman&#x27;s career average. Don Bradman is the only player in the world to have scored 5000 runs against a single opposition: 5028 runs against England.

In the Manchester Test of 1956, England spin bowler Jim Laker took 19 wickets for 90 runs (19–90) which set not only the Test record for best match figures but also the first-class one. In taking 10–53 in the second innings he became the first bowler to capture ten wickets in a Test match innings, and his analysis remains the best innings figures. Indian leg spinner Anil Kumble was the second bowler to take 10 wickets in an innings, claiming 10–74 against Pakistan in 1999. In December 2021, New Zealand spinner, Ajaz Patel became the third bowler to take 10 wickets in an innings. West Indies batsman Brian Lara has the highest individual score in Test cricket: he scored 400 not out against England in 2004 to surpass the innings of 380 by Matthew Hayden six months earlier. Lara had held the record before Hayden, with a score of 375 against England 10 years earlier. Pakistan&#x27;s Misbah-ul-Haq holds the record of the fastest Test half century, scoring 50 runs from 21 balls. The record for the fastest Test century is held by New Zealand&#x27;s Brendon McCullum, who scored 100 runs from 54 balls in his final Test match.

The trend of countries playing more Test matches in the modern era means that the aggregate lists are dominated by modern players. Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan became the highest Test wicket-taker in December 2007, when he passed Shane Warne&#x27;s total of 708 wickets. Within a year, the equivalent batting record of highest run-scorer had also changed hands: Sachin Tendulkar surpassed the tally of 11,953 runs by Brian Lara. The record for most dismissals by a wicket-keeper is held by Mark Boucher of South Africa while the record for most catches by a fielder is held by Rahul Dravid.
== Listing criteria ==
In general the top five are listed in each category (except when there is a tie for the last place among the five, when all the tied record holders are noted).

== Listing notation ==
;Team notation
* (300–3) indicates that a team scored 300 runs for three wickets and the innings was closed, either due to a successful run chase or if no playing time remained
* (300–3 d) indicates that a team scored 300 runs for three wickets, and declared its innings closed
* (300) indicates that a team scored 300 runs and was all out

;Batting notation
* (100) indicates that a batsman scored 100 runs and was out
* (100*) indicates that a batsman scored 100 runs and was not out

;Bowling notation
* (5–100) indicates that a bowler has captured 5 wickets while conceding 100 runs

;Currently playing
* indicates a current Test cricketer

;Seasons
* Domestic cricket seasons in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and the West Indies may span two calendar years, and are by convention said to be played in (&quot;e.g.&quot;) &quot;2008–09&quot;. A cricket season in England is described as a single year. &quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;2009&quot;. An international Test series may be for a much shorter duration, and Cricinfo treats this issue by stating &quot;any series or matches which began between May and September of any given year will appear in the relevant single year season and any that began between October and April will appear in the relevant cross-year season&quot;. In the record tables, a two-year span generally indicates that the record was set within a domestic season in one of the above named countries.

<doc id="302966" wikidata="Q504016" url="?curid=302966" title="Thomas Elyot">
<text>Sir Thomas Elyot (c. 149626 March 1546) was an English diplomat and scholar. He is best known as one of the first proponents of the use of the English language for literary purposes.

==Early life==
Thomas was the child of Sir Richard Elyot&#x27;s first marriage with Alice De la Mare, but neither the date nor place of his birth is accurately known. Alice&#x27;s first husband Thomas Dabridgecourt had died 10 Oct 1495 so this next marriage has to follow that date.

Anthony Wood claimed him as an alumnus of St Mary Hall, Oxford, while C. H. Cooper in the &quot;Athenae Cantabrigienses&quot; put in a claim for Jesus College, Cambridge. Elyot himself says in the preface to his &quot;Dictionary&quot; that he was educated under the paternal roof, and was from the age of twelve his own tutor. He supplies, in the introduction to his &quot;Castel of Helth&quot;, a list of the authors he had read in philosophy and medicine, adding that a &quot;worshipful physician&quot; (Thomas Linacre) read to him from Galen and some other authors.

==Career==
In 1511 he accompanied his father on the western circuit as clerk to the assize, and he held this position until 1528. In addition to his father&#x27;s lands in Wiltshire and Oxfordshire he inherited in 1523 the Cambridge estates of his cousin, Thomas Fynderne. His title was disputed, but Cardinal Wolsey decided in his favour, and also made him clerk of the Privy Council. Elyot, in a letter addressed to Thomas Cromwell, says that he never received the emoluments of this office, while the empty honour of knighthood conferred on him when he was displaced in 1530 merely put him to further expense. In that year he sat on the commission appointed to inquire into the Cambridgeshire estates of his former patron, Wolsey. He was appointed High Sheriff of Oxfordshire and Berkshire in 1527.

In 1531 he received instructions to proceed to the court of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, to try to persuade him to take a more favourable view of Henry&#x27;s proposed divorce from Catherine of Aragon, the emperor&#x27;s aunt. With this was combined another commission, on which one of the king&#x27;s agents, Stephen Vaughan, was already engaged. He was, if possible, to apprehend William Tyndale. Elyot was probably suspected, like Vaughan, of lukewarmness in carrying out the king&#x27;s wishes, but was nevertheless blamed by Protestant writers. As ambassador Elyot had been involved in ruinous expense, and on his return he wrote unsuccessfully to Cromwell begging to be excused, on the grounds of his poverty, from serving as High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire for 1532.

He was one of the commissioners in the inquiry instituted by Cromwell prior to the suppression of the monasteries but he did not obtain any share of the spoils. There is little doubt that his known friendship for More militated against his chances of success, for in a letter addressed to Cromwell he admitted his friendship for More, but protested that he rated higher his duty to the king. William Roper, in his &quot;Life of More&quot;, says that Elyot was on a second embassy to Charles V in the winter of 1535–1536 and received the news of More&#x27;s execution while at Naples. He had been kept in the dark by his own government, but heard the news from the emperor, or so Roper says, writing years later, but R. W. Chambers writes that Roper had confused the timing of Elyot&#x27;s ambassadorship, and of the emperor&#x27;s remarks—about More&#x27;s resignation, not his execution. The story of an earlier embassy to Rome (1532), mentioned by Burnet, rests on a late endorsement of instructions dated from that year, which cannot be regarded as authoritative.

From 1539 to 1542 he represented the borough of Cambridge in parliament. He had purchased from Cromwell the manor of Carleton in Cambridgeshire, where he died.

==Private life==
He married Margaret à Barrow, described as a student in the &quot;school&quot; of Sir Thomas More. He had no children.

==Scholarship==

Elyot received little reward for his services to the state, but his scholarship and his books were held in high esteem by his contemporaries.

Elyot was a supporter of the humanists&#x27; ideas concerning the education of women; writing in support of learned women, he published the &quot;Defence of Good Women&quot;. In this writing he supported Thomas More and other humanist authors&#x27; ideals of educated wives who would be able to provide intellectual companionship for their husbands and educated moral training for their children.

In 1531 he produced &quot;The Boke named the Governour&quot;, dedicated to King Henry VIII which was printed by Thomas Berthelet (1531, 1534, 1536, 1544, etc.). It is a treatise on moral philosophy, intended to direct the education of those destined to fill high positions, and to inculcate those moral principles which alone could fit them for the performance of their duties. The subject was a favourite one in the 16th century, and the book, which contained many citations from classical authors, was very popular. Elyot expressly acknowledges his obligations to Erasmus&#x27;s &quot;Institutio Principis Christiani&quot; but he makes no reference to the &quot;De regno et regis institutione&quot; of Francesco Patrizzi (died 1494), bishop of Gaeta, on which his work was undoubtedly modelled.

As a prose writer, Elyot enriched the English language with many new words. In 1536 he published &quot;The Castel of Helth&quot;, a popular treatise on medicine, intended to place a scientific knowledge of the art within the reach of those unacquainted with Greek. This work, though scoffed at by the faculty, was appreciated by the general public, and speedily went through seventeen editions. His Latin &quot;Dictionary&quot;, the earliest comprehensive dictionary of the language, was completed in 1538. The copy of the first edition in the British Museum contains an autograph letter from Elyot to Cromwell, to whom it originally belonged. It was edited and enlarged in 1548 by Thomas Cooper, Bishop of Winchester, who called it &quot;Bibliotheca Eliotae&quot;, and it formed the basis in 1565 of Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Thesaurus linguae Romanae et Britannicae&quot;.

His &quot;Image of Governance, compiled of the Actes and Sentences notable of the most noble Emperor Alexander Severus&quot; (1540) professed to be a translation from a Greek manuscript of the emperor&#x27;s secretary Encolpius (or Eucolpius, as Elyot calls him), which had been lent him by a gentleman of Naples, called Pudericus, who asked to have it back before the translation was complete. In these circumstances Elyot, as he asserts in his preface, supplied the other maxims from different sources.

He was violently attacked by Humphrey Hody and later by William Wotton for putting forward a pseudo-translation but Henry Herbert Stephen Croft (1842–1923) later discovered that there was a Neapolitan gentleman at that time bearing the name of Poderico, or, Latinized, Pudericus, with whom Elyot may well have been acquainted. Roger Ascham mentions his &quot;De rebus memorabilibus Angliae&quot; and William Webbe quotes a few lines of a lost translation of the &quot;Ars Poetica&quot; of Horace.

<text>Thomas Sidney Cooper (26 September 18037 February 1902) was an English landscape painter from Canterbury, noted for his images of cattle and farm animals.

== Early life ==
Thomas Sidney Cooper was born in St Peter&#x27;s Street in Canterbury, Kent, and baptised at St Peter&#x27;s Church. As a small child he began to show strong artistic talent, but his family had little money (his father had deserted the family when the boy was five) and could not pay for any tuition, or even for paper and pencils. Indeed, to help support the family, by the time he was twelve years old he was working as a coach painter, then later as a scenery painter with a travelling theatre company, and he alternated between these two occupations for about eight years. He still had a driving desire to become an artist, and all his spare moments were spent drawing and painting from nature. At the age of twenty he went to London, drew for a while in the British Museum, and after much perseverance was admitted as a student of the Royal Academy.

Unable to afford to continue living in London he was forced to return to Canterbury, where he earnt a living as a drawing master and by the sale of sketches and drawings. In 1827 he and friend went to Brussels and through some luck and perseverance, Cooper started to make a living through painting portraits and also becoming a drawing master. Here he met and married Charlotte Pearson. He also met Eugène Joseph Verboeckhoven who was to have a great influence on his painting. The Belgian Revolution of 1830 saw Cooper and Charlotte returning to London with their first child. Cooper tried his luck in London again, selling sketches and teaching and showed his first picture at the Royal Academy in 1833, beginning a long and prolific career as an exhibitor at the Royal Academy and British Institution among others. His &#x27;Intercepted Raid, Ettrick Shepherd&#x27;, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1842, an oil on canvas, sold at Sotheby’s for £37,500 making it, at that time, the most valuable work to be sold at auction.

When the competition was announced for the decoration for the new Houses of Parliament, to be held at Westminster Hall in 1847, Cooper submitted &quot;The Defeat of Kellermann&#x27;s Cuirassiers and Carabiniers by Somerset&#x27;s Cavalry Brigade at Waterloo, June 18, 1815&quot;, without success. In order to complete the picture, the artist used Siborne&#x27;s model of the battlefield then on exhibition in London, while a friend in Brussels sent him breastplates worn by the various cavalry regiments, and a trooper of the Life Guards acted as a model.

One of the finest landscape painters of his day, he is mainly associated with pictures of cattle or sheep, a fact that earned him the epithet &quot;Cow Cooper&quot;. Cooper collaborated between 1847 and 1870 with Frederick Richard Lee R.A. on several paintings, Lee undertaking the landscapes, and Cooper adding animals to complete the scene. He travelled round the country, sometimes with his son, painting in Wales, Scotland and the Lake District as well as his home county of Kent.

In London he moved in elevated circles, counting many artists, politicians and writers, including Charles Dickens, as his friends. He had a long acquaintanceship with JMW Turner whom he describes in his autobiography as taking a ‘great interest in me and my success’. Cooper also was favoured by Queen Victoria who invited him to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.

Cooper was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA) in 1845 and Royal Academician (RA) on 22 June 1867.

== Cooper and Canterbury ==

Cooper had a long association with his birthplace, Canterbury. At the height of his fame in London he moved back to the city, building a house, Vernon Holme, in Harbledown and living in it until his death in 1902. (The house is now owned by Kent College.) From the first year that he settled in the country, he started breeding his own animals, so that he always had models at hand. He was of the opinion that &#x27;all Landscape painters should live in the country&#x27;.

He loved the theatre and in 1856 bought a block of buildings on Guildhall Street and, drawing on his past experiences as a scenery painter, designed a new theatre for Canterbury. His great friend Charles Dickens, who gave a reading there, praised the design saying &#x27;Why Cooper, I have not had to make the slightest effort to send my voice even to the back seats of the gallery&#x27;. 
He was a great philanthropist in Canterbury, and used some of his wealth to help the poor in the city. In 1868, he purchased the house where he had been born on St Peter&#x27;s Street and where his mother had lived, and the block of buildings around it, building the portico as the entrance, to establish the Sidney Cooper Gallery and Art School. This was partly as a memorial to his mother Sarah (1776-1865) but also to provide free tuition to poorer local students who wished to study art, providing the teaching that was missing during his early years. The students were charged only one penny to cover the cost of lighting and fire in the winter. His fellow Academician friends donated casts, statues and drawings for students to study and some donated their time to act as examiners, including Alma-Tadema, William Morris and Poynter. The school was affiliated with the Science and Art Department in South Kensington led by Henry Cole, the first director of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Amongst Cooper&#x27;s more well-known students was Mary Tourtel, creator and illustrator of the Rupert Bear books for children. Cooper himself came regularly to teach often staying late in the evenings to help those boys and girls who could not come during the day.
Cooper left both the Gallery and house in Trust to the Canterbury City Council of the day with the condition that it be used for artistic and educational purposes. Since then the space has been through a number of incarnations. Ian Dury of Blockheads fame taught at the school from 1970-1973 when it was known as the Canterbury College of Art. It has since been used by the University for the Creative Arts and Canterbury Christ Church University as a working studio and exhibition space. The Gallery has been empty since 2020 and is in some need of repair.

== Legacy ==

Cooper wrote his reminiscences, under the title of &quot;My Life&quot;, in 1890. Among many fascinating anecdotes, he recalls fleeing the fighting in Brussels when the Belgian Revolution broke out, his meetings with JMW Turner, with Charles Dickens and his commission by Queen Victoria to paint a prize bull. Thomas and Charlotte had four children; his son, Thomas George Cooper, also became an artist. Twenty years after his first wife died Cooper married Mary Cannon and had a son, Nevill.

The oldest member of the Royal Academy of Arts at the time of the accession of King Edward VII in 1901, Cooper was received by the King in July 1901, and appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO). Painting right until the end of his life, such was his fame that his declining health in 1901 was reported in newspapers, where he was referred to as &#x27;the grand old man of art&#x27;. His funeral was at Canterbury Cathedral and he is buried in the graveyard of St Martin&#x27;s Church, Canterbury. So prolific a painter was he that the studio sale conducted by Christies in 1902 after his death lasted a full three days. 

The largest public collection of Cooper paintings is owned by Canterbury City Council and housed at the Beaney House of Art &amp; Knowledge in Canterbury. Examples are also held by the Tate Gallery, London, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and other public collections, mainly in Britain. The definitive account of his life and catalogue of his work &#x27;Thomas Sidney Cooper - His Life and Work&#x27;, by Kenneth Westwood was published in two volumes in 2011 by David Leathers, Ilminster.

<text>Thomas Cooper (or Couper; 29 April 1594) was an English bishop, lexicographer, theologian, and writer.

==Life==
Cooper was born in Oxford, England, where he was educated at Magdalen College. He became Master of Magdalen College School and afterwards practised as a physician in Oxford.

Elizabeth I was greatly pleased with his &quot;Thesaurus&quot;, generally known as &quot;Cooper&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;; and its author, who had been ordained about 1559, was made Dean of Christ Church, in 1567. Two years later, on 27 June 1569, he became Dean of Gloucester; he was elected Bishop of Lincoln on 4 February 1571, consecrated a bishop on 24 February 1571, then translated to Winchester on 12 March 1584.

Cooper was a stout controversialist; he defended the practice and precept of the Church of England against the Roman Catholics on the one hand and against the Martin Marprelate writings and the Puritans on the other. He took some part, the exact extent of which is disputed, in the persecution of religious recusants in his diocese, and died at Winchester on 29 April 1594.

==Works==
Cooper&#x27;s literary career began in 1548, when he compiled, or rather edited, &quot;Bibliotheca Eliotae&quot;, a Latin dictionary by Sir Thomas Elyot. In 1549 he published a continuation of Thomas Lanquet&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle of the World&quot;. This work, known as &quot;Cooper&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;, covers the period from AD 17 to the time of its writing. Following Robert Crowley&#x27;s 1559 altered and updated version of the Chronicle which Cooper denounced, he issued an expanded and updated version in 1560 and 1565 that removed or altered most but not all of Crowley&#x27;s changes and additions. In 1565 appeared the first edition of his greatest work, &quot;Thesaurus Linguae Romanae et Britannicae&quot;, and this was followed by three other editions.

John Aubrey in &quot;Brief lives&quot;, gave the following glimpse into the creation of this dictionary:

&quot;Dr. Edward Davenant told me that this learned man had a shrew to his wife, who was irreconcileably angrie with him for sitting-up late at night so, compileing his Dictionarie, (Thesaurus linguae Romanae et Britannicae, Londini, 1584; dedicated to Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, and Chancellor of Oxford). When he had halfe-donne it, she had the opportunity to gett into his studie, tooke all his paines out in her lap, and threw it into the fire, and burnt it. Well, for all that, that good man had so great a zeale for the advancement of learning, that he began it again, and went through with it to that perfection that he hath left it to us, a most usefull worke.&quot;

William Shakespeare is believed to have used Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Thesaurus&quot; in the creation of his many poems and plays. (Evidence of this comes from a close statistical inspection of Shakespeare&#x27;s word usage.)

Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Admonition against Martin Marprelate&quot; was reprinted in 1847, and his &quot;Answer in Defence of the Truth against the Apology of Private Mass&quot; in 1850. (This latter work was answered by the Jesuit controversialist Fr. John Rastell in 1565.)

<text>Edward Scissorhands is a 1990 American gothic romantic fantasy film directed by Tim Burton. It was produced by Burton and Denise Di Novi, written by Caroline Thompson from a story by her and Burton, and starring Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker, Vincent Price, and Alan Arkin. It tells the story of an unfinished artificial humanoid who has scissor blades instead of hands, is taken in by a suburban family, and falls in love with their teenage daughter.

Burton conceived &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; from his childhood upbringing in suburban Burbank, California. During pre-production of &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, Thompson was hired to adapt Burton&#x27;s story into a screenplay, and the film began development at 20th Century Fox after Warner Bros. declined. &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; was then after Burton&#x27;s critical and financial success with &quot;Batman&quot;. The film also marks the fourth collaboration between Burton and film score composer Danny Elfman, and was Vincent Price&#x27;s last film role to be released in his lifetime.

&quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; was a critical and commercial success, grossing over four times its $20 million budget. The film won the British Academy Film Award for Best Production Design and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, in addition to receiving multiple nominations at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, and the Saturn Awards. Both Burton and Elfman consider &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; their most personal and favorite work.

==Plot==
One snowy evening, an elderly woman tells her granddaughter the bedtime story of a young man named Edward, who has scissor blades for hands.

Many years earlier, Peg Boggs, a local door-to-door Avon saleswoman, not having any luck in her own neighborhood, tries to sell at the decrepit Gothic mansion where Edward lives. The creation of an old inventor, Edward is an ageless humanoid. The inventor homeschooled Edward but died from a heart attack before giving Edward hands, leaving him unfinished. Peg finds Edward alone and offers to take him to her home after discovering he is virtually harmless. Peg introduces Edward to her husband Bill, their young son Kevin, and their teenage daughter Kim. Edward falls in love with Kim, despite her initial fear of him. As their neighbors are curious about the new houseguest, the Boggs throw a neighborhood barbecue welcoming him. Most of the neighbors are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, except for the eccentric religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kim&#x27;s supercilious boyfriend Jim.

Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into topiaries, progressing to grooming dogs and later styling the hair of the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon so he can support himself. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce him, but scares him away. Joyce lies to the neighborhood women that Edward forced himself on her, reducing their trust in him. Edward&#x27;s dream of opening the salon is ruined when the bank refuses him a loan on the grounds that he has no assessment and collateral and is not legally a human.

Jealous of Kim&#x27;s attraction to Edward, Jim takes advantage of his naivety by asking him to pick the lock on his parents&#x27; home so he can steal his father&#x27;s electronic goods and sell them to buy a van. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, a burglar alarm is triggered and walls come down, trapping Edward inside. Jim flees and Edward is arrested. The police determine that a lifetime of isolation has left Edward without any common sense or morality; thus, he cannot be criminally charged. Edward nevertheless takes responsibility for the robbery, telling Kim that he did it because she asked him to. Consequently, he is shunned by the entire neighborhood except for the Boggs family.

At Christmas, Edward carves an angelic ice sculpture modeled after Kim; the ice shavings are thrown into the air and fall like snow, something that has never happened before in the town. Kim dances in the snowfall. Jim arrives suddenly, calling out to Edward, surprising him and causing him to accidentally cut Kim&#x27;s hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming her, but Kim, disgusted and fed up with Jim&#x27;s jealous behavior towards Edward, breaks up with him. Meanwhile, Edward flees in a rage, destroying one of his works and scaring Esmeralda until he is calmed by a wandering dog.

Kim&#x27;s parents go out to find Edward while she stays behind in case he returns. Edward returns, finding Kim there. She asks him to hold her, but Edward hesitates, afraid of hurting her. Kim arranges Edward&#x27;s scissor hands so they can embrace. Jim&#x27;s drunken friend drives to Kim&#x27;s house and nearly runs over Kevin, but Edward pushes Kevin to safety while inadvertently cutting him. Witnesses accuse Edward of attacking Kevin. When Jim assaults him, Edward defends himself and injures Jim&#x27;s arm before fleeing back to the inventor&#x27;s mansion.

Kim goes to find Edward. Jim obtains a gun, follows her, and shoots at Edward before grabbing a fire poker and beating him. Edward refuses to fight back until he sees Jim strike Kim as she attempts to intervene. Enraged, Edward stabs Jim in the stomach and pushes him from a window of the mansion to his death. Kim confesses her love to Edward and kisses him as they accept that their love can never be fulfilled. As the neighbors gather, Kim convinces them that Jim and Edward killed each other, holding up an extra hand of blades she grabbed from a display case in the mansion as proof.

The elderly woman, revealing herself to be Kim, finishes telling her granddaughter the story and says that she never saw Edward again, hoping that by staying away Edward would remember her as she was in her youth. She believes he is still alive because it would not be snowing without him. Edward is then seen carving ice sculptures of his experiences with Kim, with the bits of ice floating as snow in the wind. The elderly Kim, commenting on the snow, concludes with, &quot;Sometimes you can even catch me dancing in it.&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
The genesis of &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; came from a drawing by then-teenaged director Tim Burton, which reflected his feelings of isolation and being unable to communicate to people around him in suburban Burbank. The drawing depicted a thin, solemn man with long, sharp blades for fingers. Burton stated that he was often alone and had trouble retaining friendships. &quot;I get the feeling people just got this urge to want to leave me alone for some reason, I don&#x27;t know exactly why.&quot; During pre-production of &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, Burton hired Caroline Thompson, then a young novelist, to write the &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; screenplay as a spec script. Burton was impressed with her short novel, &quot;First Born&quot;, which was &quot;about an abortion that came back to life&quot;. Burton felt &quot;First Born&quot; had the same psychological elements he wanted to showcase in &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;. &quot;Every detail was so important to Tim because it was so personal&quot;, Thompson remarked. She wrote &quot;Scissorhands&quot; as a &quot;love poem&quot; to Burton, stating &quot;He is the most articulate person I know but I couldn&#x27;t tell you a single complete sentence he has ever said&quot;.

Shortly after Thompson&#x27;s hiring, Burton began to develop &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; at Warner Bros., with whom he worked on &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, and &quot;Batman&quot;. However, within a couple of months, Warner sold the film rights to 20th Century Fox. Fox agreed to finance Thompson&#x27;s screenplay while giving Burton complete creative control. At the time, the budget was projected to be around $8–9 million. When writing the storyline, Burton and Thompson were influenced by Universal Horror films, such as &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1923), &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1925), &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931), and &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; (1954), as well as &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933) and various fairy tales. Burton originally wanted to make &quot;Scissorhands&quot; as a musical, feeling &quot;it seemed big and operatic to me&quot;, but later dropped the idea. Following the enormous success of &quot;Batman&quot;, Burton arrived to the status of being an A-list director. He had the opportunity to do any film he wanted, but rather than Warner Bros.&#x27; choices for &quot;Batman Returns&quot; or &quot;Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian&quot;, Burton opted to make &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; for Fox.

===Casting===
Although Winona Ryder was the first cast member attached to the script, Dianne Wiest was the first to sign on. &quot;Dianne, in particular, was wonderful&quot;, Burton said. &quot;She was the first actress to read the script, supported it completely and, because she is so respected, once she had given it her stamp of approval, others soon got interested&quot;. When it came to casting the lead role of Edward, several actors were considered; Fox was insistent on having Burton meet with Tom Cruise. &quot;He certainly wasn&#x27;t my ideal, but I talked to him&quot;, Burton remembered. &quot;He was interesting, but I think it worked out for the best. A lot of questions came up&quot;. Cruise asked for a &quot;happier&quot; ending. Tom Hanks and Gary Oldman turned down the part, Hanks in favor of critical and commercial flop &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;. Oldman found the story to be absurd, but understood it after watching &quot;literally two minutes&quot; of the completed film. Jim Carrey was also considered for the role, while Thompson favored John Cusack. Elsewhere, William Hurt, Robert Downey Jr. and musician Michael Jackson expressed interest, although Burton did not converse with Jackson.

Though Burton was unfamiliar with Johnny Depp&#x27;s then-popular performance in &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, he had always been Burton&#x27;s first choice. At the time of his casting, Depp was seeking to break out of the teen idol status which his performance in &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; had afforded him. When he was sent the script, Depp immediately found personal and emotional connections with the story. In preparation for the role, Depp watched many Charlie Chaplin films to study the idea of creating sympathy without dialogue. Fox studio executives were so worried about Edward&#x27;s image, that they tried to keep pictures of Depp in full costume under wraps until release of the film. Burton approached Ryder for the role of Kim Boggs based on their positive working experience in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;. Drew Barrymore previously auditioned for the role. Crispin Glover auditioned for the role of Jim before Anthony Michael Hall was cast.

Kathy Baker saw her part of Joyce, the neighbor who tries to seduce Edward, as a perfect chance to break into comedy. Alan Arkin says when he first read the script, he was &quot;a bit baffled. Nothing really made sense to me until I saw the sets. Burton&#x27;s visual imagination is extraordinary&quot;. The role of The Inventor was written specifically for Vincent Price, and would ultimately be his final feature film role. Burton commonly watched Price&#x27;s films as a child, and, after completing &quot;Vincent&quot;, the two became good friends. Robert Oliveri was cast as Kevin, Kim&#x27;s younger brother.

===Filming===
Burbank, California was considered as a possible location for the suburban neighborhoods, but Burton believed the city had become too altered since his childhood so the Tampa Bay Area of Florida, including the town of Lutz, on Tinsmith Circle inside the Carpenter&#x27;s Run subdivision, and the Southgate Shopping Center of Lakeland was chosen for a three-month shooting schedule. The production crew found, in the words of the production designer Bo Welch, &quot;a kind of generic, plain-wrap suburb, which we made even more characterless by painting all the houses in faded pastels, and reducing the window sizes to make it look a little more paranoid.&quot; The key element to unify the look of the neighborhood was Welch&#x27;s decision to repaint each of the houses in one of four colors, which he described as &quot;sea-foam green, dirty flesh, butter, and dirty blue&quot;. The facade of the Gothic mansion was built just outside Dade City. The majority of filming took place in Lutz between March 26 and July 19, 1990. Filming &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; created hundreds of (temporary) jobs and injected over $4 million into the Tampa Bay economy. Production then moved to a Fox Studios sound stage in Century City, California, where interiors of the mansion were filmed.

To create Edward&#x27;s scissor hands, Burton employed Stan Winston, who would later design the Penguin&#x27;s prosthetic makeup in &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. Depp&#x27;s wardrobe and prosthetic makeup took one hour and 45 minutes to apply. The giant topiaries that Edward creates in the film were made by wrapping metal skeletons in chicken wire, then weaving in thousands of small plastic plant sprigs. Rick Heinrichs worked as one of the art directors.

===Music===
&quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; is the fourth feature film collaboration between director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elfman. The orchestra consisted of 79 musicians. Elfman cites &quot;Scissorhands&quot; as epitomizing his most personal and favorite work. In addition to Elfman&#x27;s music, three Tom Jones songs also appear: &quot;It&#x27;s Not Unusual&quot;, &quot;Delilah&quot; and &quot;With These Hands&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s Not Unusual&quot; would later be used in &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; (1996), another film of Burton&#x27;s with music composed by Elfman.

==Themes==
Burton acknowledged that the main themes of &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; deal with self-discovery and isolation. Edward is found living alone in the attic of a Gothic castle, a setting that is also used for main characters in Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;. &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; climaxes much like James Whale&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and Burton&#x27;s own &quot;Frankenweenie&quot;. A mob confronts the &quot;evil creature&quot;, in this case, Edward, at his castle. With Edward unable to consummate his love for Kim because of his appearance, the film can also be seen as being influenced by &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; is a fairy tale book-ended by a prologue and an epilogue featuring Kim Boggs as an old woman telling her granddaughter the story, augmenting the German Expressionism and Gothic fiction archetypes.

Burton explained that his depiction of suburbia is &quot;not a bad place. It&#x27;s a weird place. I tried to walk the fine line of making it funny and strange without it being judgmental. It&#x27;s a place where there&#x27;s a lot of integrity.&quot; Kim leaves her jock boyfriend (Jim) to be with Edward, an event that many have postulated as Burton&#x27;s revenge against jocks he encountered as a teenager in suburban Burbank, California. Jim is subsequently killed, a scene that shocked a number of observers who felt the whole tone of the film had been radically altered. Burton referred to this scene as a &quot;high school fantasy&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Test screenings for the film were encouraging for 20th Century Fox. Joe Roth, then president of the company, considered marketing &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; on the scale of &quot;an &quot;E.T.&quot;-sized blockbuster,&quot; but Roth decided not to aggressively promote the film in that direction. &quot;We have to let it find its place. We want to be careful not to hype the movie out of the universe,&quot; he reasoned. &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; had its limited release in the United States on December 7, 1990. The wide release came on December 14, and the film earned $6,325,249 in its opening weekend in 1,372 theaters. &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; eventually grossed $56,362,352 in North America, and a further $29,661,653 outside North America, coming to a worldwide total of $86.02 million. With a budget of $20 million, the film is considered a box office success. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;the chemistry between Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, who were together in real life at the time (1989–1993), gave the film teen idol potential, drawing younger audiences.&quot;

===Critical response===
&quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; received acclaim from critics and audiences. CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film an &quot;A−&quot; grade.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the piece by stating, &quot;Burton&#x27;s richly entertaining update of the &quot;Frankenstein&quot; story is the year&#x27;s most comic, romantic and haunting film fantasy.&quot; He continued by praising Depp&#x27;s performance, stating, &quot;Depp artfully expresses the fierce longing in gentle Edward; it&#x27;s a terrific performance&quot; and the &quot;engulfing score&quot; from Danny Elfman. Amy Dawes of &quot;Variety&quot; spoke highly of the film, &quot;Director [Burton] takes a character as wildly unlikely as a boy whose arms end in pruning shears, and makes him the center of a delightful and delicate comic fable.&quot;

Marc Lee of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; scored the film five out of five stars, writing, &quot;Burton&#x27;s modern fairytale has an almost palpably personal feel: it is told gently, subtly and with infinite sympathy for an outsider who charms the locals but then inadvertently arouses their baser instincts.&quot; He also praised Depp as being &quot;sensational in the lead role, summoning anxiety, melancholy and innocence with heartbreaking conviction. And it&#x27;s all in the eyes: his dialogue is cut-to-the-bone minimal.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Desson Thomson wrote, &quot;Depp is perfectly cast, Burton builds a surrealistically funny cul-de-sac world, and there are some very funny performances from grownups Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker and Alan Arkin.&quot; Rita Kempley, also writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, praised the film: &quot;Enchantment on the cutting edge, a dark yet heartfelt portrait of the artist as a young mannequin.&quot; She too praised Depp&#x27;s performance in stating, &quot;... nicely cast, brings the eloquence of the silent era to this part of few words, saying it all through bright black eyes and the tremulous care with which he holds his horror-movie hands.

Owen Gleiberman, writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, gave the film an &quot;A−&quot; rating, commending Elfman&#x27;s score and calling the character of Edward &quot;Burton&#x27;s surreal portrait of himself as an artist: a wounded child converting his private darkness into outlandish pop visions&quot;, and &quot;Burton&#x27;s purest achievement as a director so far.&quot; Of Depp he wrote, &quot;Depp may not be doing that much acting beneath his neo-Kabuki makeup, but what he does is tremulous and affecting.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. Burton invests awe-inspiring ingenuity into the process of reinventing something very small.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a mixed review, awarding it two stars out of four and writing that &quot;Burton has not yet found the storytelling and character-building strength to go along with his pictorial flair.&quot;

===Accolades===
Stan Winston and Ve Neill were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup, but lost to John Caglione Jr. and Doug Drexler for their work on &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. Production designer Bo Welch won the BAFTA Award for Best Production Design, while costume designer Colleen Atwood, and Winston and Neil also received nominations at the British Academy Film Awards. In addition, Winston was nominated for his visual effects work. Depp was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, but lost to Gérard Depardieu of &quot;Green Card&quot;. &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; was able to win the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film. Danny Elfman, Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Alan Arkin, and Atwood received individual nominations. Elfman was also given a Grammy Award nomination.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores – Nominated
* 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10:
** Nominated Fantasy Film

==Legacy==
Burton cites &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; as epitomizing his most personal work. The film is also Burton&#x27;s first collaboration with Depp and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky. In October 2008, the Hallmark Channel purchased the television rights. Metal band Motionless in White have a song entitled &quot;Scissorhands (The Last Snow)&quot;, with its lyrics written about the film in homage to its legacy and impact on the gothic subculture. Additionally, metal band Ice Nine Kills wrote and performed the song &quot;The World in My Hands&quot; on their fifth studio album, &quot;The Silver Scream&quot;.

In 2012, Depp reprised his role in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Lois Comes Out of Her Shell&quot;; in the cutaway, Edward takes up a babysitter job and promises to the parents to make sure the baby is handled with as much care and fragility as possible; within seconds of going into the nursery, he suddenly remerges, declaring &quot;it&#x27;s dead&quot;.

An extinct lobster-like sea creature called &quot;Kootenichela deppi&quot; is named after Depp because of its scissor-like claws.

From 2014 to 2015, IDW Publishing released an &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; comic book series which serves as a sequel and takes place several decades after the film. The series consists of ten issues which have been collected in two trade paperbacks. It was written by Kate Leth with art by Drew Rausch.

An ad for the Cadillac Lyriq, an electric car with hands-free driving features, premiered during Super Bowl LV and is based on the film; it features Ryder reprising her role as Kim, now mother to Edward&#x27;s son Edgar (played by Timothée Chalamet).

In October 2024, Fortnite released a new character skin featuring Edward Scissorhands.

==Stage adaptations==
A theatrical dance adaptation by the British choreographer Matthew Bourne premiered at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in London in November 2005. After an 11-week season, the production toured the UK, Asia and the United States. The British director Richard Crawford directed a stage adaptation of the Tim Burton film, which had its world premiere on June 25, 2010, at The Brooklyn Studio Lab and ended July 3.

<doc id="302972" wikidata="Q213274" url="?curid=302972" title="Old City of Jerusalem">
<text>The Old City of Jerusalem (; ) is a walled area in East Jerusalem.

In a tradition that may have begun with an 1840s British map of the city, the Old City is divided into four uneven quarters: the Muslim Quarter, the Christian Quarter, the Armenian Quarter, and the Jewish Quarter. A fifth area, the Temple Mount, known to Muslims as Al-Aqsa or &quot;Haram al-Sharif&quot;, is home to the Dome of the Rock, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and was once the site of the Jewish Temple.

The Old City&#x27;s current walls and city gates were built by the Ottoman Empire from 1535 to 1542 under Suleiman the Magnificent. The Old City is home to several sites of key importance and holiness to the three major Abrahamic religions: the Temple Mount and the Western Wall for Judaism, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre for Christianity, and the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque for Islam. The Old City, along with its walls, was added to the World Heritage Site list of UNESCO in 1981.

In spite of its name, the Old City of Jerusalem&#x27;s current layout is different from that of ancient times. Most archeologists believe that the City of David, an archaeological site on a rocky spur south of the Temple Mount, was the original settlement core of Jerusalem during the Bronze and Iron Ages. At times, the ancient city spread to the east and north, covering Mount Zion and the Temple Mount. The Old City as defined by the walls of Suleiman is thus shifted a bit northwards compared to earlier periods of the city&#x27;s history, and smaller than it had been in its peak, during the late Second Temple period. The Old City&#x27;s current layout has been documented in significant detail, notably in old maps of Jerusalem over the last 1,500 years. 

Until the mid-19th century, the entire city of Jerusalem, with the exception of David&#x27;s Tomb complex, was enclosed within the Old City walls. The departure from the walls began in the 19th century, when the city&#x27;s municipal borders were expanded to include Arab villages such as Silwan and new Jewish neighborhoods such as Mishkenot Sha&#x27;ananim. The Old City came under Jordanian control following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel occupied East Jerusalem; since then, the entire city has been under Israeli control. Israel unilaterally asserted in its 1980 Jerusalem Law that the whole of Jerusalem was Israel&#x27;s capital. In international law, East Jerusalem is defined as territory occupied by Israel.

==Population==

In 1967, the Old City contained 17,000 Muslims, 6,000 Christians (including Armenians) and no Jews.

The current population of the Old City resides mostly in the Muslim quarter. In 2007, the total population was 36,965; there were 27,500 Muslims (growing to over 30,000 by 2013); 5,681 non-Armenian Christians, 790 Armenians (who decreased in number to about 500 by 2013); and 3,089 Jews (with almost 3,000 plus some 1,500 yeshiva students by 2013). By 2020, Old City&#x27;s population dropped to 31,120.

==Political status==

During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Old City was captured by Jordan and all its Jewish residents were evicted. During the Six-Day War in 1967, which saw hand-to-hand fighting on the Temple Mount, Israeli forces captured the Old City along with the rest of East Jerusalem, subsequently annexing them as Israeli territory and reuniting them with the western part of the city. Today, the Israeli government controls the entire area, which it considers part of its national capital. However, the Jerusalem Law of 1980, which effectively annexed East Jerusalem to Israel, was declared null and void by United Nations Security Council Resolution 478. East Jerusalem is now regarded by the international community as part of occupied Palestinian territory.

==History==

===Israelite period===
According to the Hebrew Bible, before King David&#x27;s conquest of Jerusalem in the 11th century BCE the city was home to the Jebusites. The Bible describes the city as heavily fortified with a strong city wall, a fact confirmed by archaeology. The Bible names the city ruled by King David as the City of David, in Hebrew Ir David, which was identified southeast of the Old City walls, outside the Dung Gate. In the Bible, David&#x27;s son, King Solomon, extended the city walls to include the Temple and Temple Mount. After the partition of the United Kingdom of Israel, the southern tribes remained in Jerusalem, with the city becoming the capital of the Kingdom of Judah.

Jerusalem was largely extended westwards after the Neo-Assyrian destruction of the northern Kingdom of Israel and the resulting influx of refugees. King Hezekiah had been preparing for an Assyrian invasion by fortifying the walls of the capital, building towers, and constructing a tunnel to bring fresh water to the city from a spring outside its walls. He made at least two major preparations that would help Jerusalem to resist conquest: the construction of the Siloam Tunnel, and construction of the Broad Wall. 

The First Temple period ended around 586 BCE, as Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s Neo-Babylonian Empire conquered Judah and Jerusalem, and laid waste to Solomon&#x27;s Temple and the city.

===Second Temple period===

In 538 BCE, the Persian King Cyrus the Great invited the Jews of Babylon to return to Judah to rebuild the Temple. Construction of the Second Temple was completed in 516 BCE, during the reign of Darius the Great, 70 years after the destruction of the First Temple. 

In about 440 BCE, the city was rebuilt on a smaller scale during the Persian period, when, according to the Bible, Nehemiah led the Jews who returned from the Babylonian Exile. An additional, so-called Second Wall, was built by King Herod the Great, who also expanded the Temple Mount and rebuilt the Temple. In 41–44 CE, Agrippa, king of Judea, started building the so-called &quot;Third Wall&quot; around the northern suburbs. The entire city was totally destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE.
===Late Roman, Byzantine, and Early Muslim periods===

The northern part of the city was rebuilt by the Emperor Hadrian around 130, under the name Aelia Capitolina. In the Byzantine period Jerusalem was extended southwards and again enclosed by city walls.

Muslims occupied Byzantine Jerusalem in the 7th century (637 CE) under the second caliph, `Umar Ibn al-Khattab who annexed it to the Islamic Arab Empire. He granted its inhabitants an assurance treaty. After the siege of Jerusalem, Sophronius welcomed `Umar, allegedly because, according to biblical prophecies known to the Church in Jerusalem, &quot;a poor, but just and powerful man&quot; would rise to be a protector and ally to the Christians of Jerusalem. Sophronius believed that `Umar, a great warrior who led an austere life, was a fulfillment of this prophecy. In the account by the Patriarch of Alexandria, Eutychius, it is said that `Umar paid a visit to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and sat in its courtyard. When the time for prayer arrived, however, he left the church and prayed outside the compound, in order to avoid having future generations of Muslims use his prayer there as a pretext for converting the church into a mosque. Eutychius adds that `Umar also wrote a decree which he handed to the Patriarch, in which he prohibited Muslims gathering in prayer at the site.

===Crusader &amp; Ayyubid periods===

In 1099, Jerusalem was captured by the Western Christian army of the First Crusade and it remained in their hands until recaptured by the Arab Muslims, led by Saladin, on October 2, 1187. He summoned the Jews and permitted them to resettle in the city. In 1219, the walls of the city were razed by Sultan Al-Mu&#x27;azzam of Damascus; in 1229, by treaty with Egypt, Jerusalem came into the hands of Frederick II of Germany. In 1239 he began to rebuild the walls, but they were demolished again by Da&#x27;ud, the emir of Kerak. In 1243, Jerusalem came again under the control of the Christians, and the walls were repaired. The Khwarazmian Turks took the city in 1244 and Sultan Malik al-Muazzam razed the walls, rendering it again defenseless and dealing a heavy blow to the city&#x27;s status.

===Ottoman period===
The current walls of the Old City were built in 1535–42 by the Ottoman Turkish sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. The walls stretch for approximately , and rise to a height of between 5 and 15 metres (16.4–49 ft), with a thickness of at the base of the wall. Altogether, the Old City walls contain 35 towers, of which 15 are concentrated in the more exposed northern wall. Suleiman&#x27;s wall had six gates, to which a seventh, the New Gate, was added in 1887; several other, older gates, have been walled up over the centuries. The Golden Gate was at first rebuilt and left open by Suleiman&#x27;s architects, only to be walled up a short while later. The New Gate was opened in the wall surrounding the Christian Quarter during the 19th century. Two secondary gates were reopened in recent times on the southeastern side of the city walls as a result of archaeological work.

==UNESCO status==
In 1980, Jordan proposed that the Old City be listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was added to the List in 1981. In 1982, Jordan requested that it be added to the List of World Heritage in Danger. The United States government opposed the request, noting that the Jordanian government had no standing to make such a nomination and that the consent of the Israeli government would be required since it effectively controlled Jerusalem. In 2011, UNESCO issued a statement reiterating its view that East Jerusalem is &quot;part of the occupied Palestinian territory, and that the status of Jerusalem must be resolved in permanent status negotiations.&quot;

==Archaeology==

===Israelite period===

Among the Israelite period finds in the Old City are two portions of the 8th and 7th century BCE city walls, in the area of the Israelite Tower, probably including parts of a gate where numerous projectiles were found, attesting to the Babylonian sack of Jerusalem in 586 BCE. Another part of the late 8th-century BCE fortification discovered was dubbed the &quot;broad wall&quot;, after the way it was described in the &quot;Book of Nehemiah&quot;, built to defend Jerusalem against the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem of 701 BCE.

===Hellenistic period===
In 2015, archaeologists uncovered the remnants of an impressive fort, built by Greeks in the center of old Jerusalem. It is believed that it is the remnants of the Acra fortress. The team also found coins that date from the time of Antiochus IV to the time of Antiochus VII. In addition, they found Greek arrowheads, slingshots, ballistic stones and amphorae.

In 2018, archaeologists discovered a 4-centimeter-long filigree gold earring with a ram&#x27;s head around 200 meters south of the Temple Mount. The Israel Antiquities Authority said it was consistent with jewelry from the early Hellenistic period (3rd or early 2nd century BCE). Adding that it was the first time somebody finds a golden earring from the Hellenistic times in Jerusalem.

===Herodian period===
Many structures dated to the Herodian period were discovered in the Jewish Quarter during archaeological excavations carried out between 1967 and 1983. Among them was unearthed a palatial mansion from the Herodian period, believed to be the residence of Annas the High Priest. In its vicinity, a depiction of the Temple menorah was discovered, carved while its model still stood in the Temple, engraved in a plastered wall. The palace has been destroyed during the final days of the Roman siege of 70 CE, suffering the same fate as the so-called Burnt House, a building belonging to the Kathros priestly family, which was found nearby.

In 1968, the Trumpeting Place inscription was found at the southwest corner of Temple Mount, and is believed to mark the site where the priests used to declare the advent of Shabbat and other Jewish holidays.

===Byzantine period===
In the 1970s, while excavating the remains of the Nea Church (the New Church of the Theotokos), a Greek inscription was found. It reads: &quot;This work too was donated by our most pious Emperor Flavius Justinian, through the provision and care of Constantine, most saintly priest and abbot, in the 13th year of the indiction.&quot; A second dedicatory inscription bearing the names of Emperor Justinian and of the same abbot of the Nea Church was discovered in 2017 among the ruins of a pilgrim hostel about a kilometre north of Damascus Gate, which proves the importance of the Nea complex at the time.

==Quarters==

The Old City is currently divided into four uneven quarters: the Muslim Quarter, the Christian Quarter, the Armenian Quarter and the Jewish Quarter. Matthew Teller writes that this four-quarter convention may have originated in the 1841 British Royal Engineers map of Jerusalem, or at least Reverend George Williams&#x27; subsequent labelling of it. A fifth quarter, the Mughrabi Quarter, was demolished following the Six-Day War.

This 19th-century cartographic partition into four quarters represented the historical development of the city that had previously been divided into many more &quot;harat&quot; (: &quot;quarters&quot;, &quot;neighborhoods&quot;, &quot;districts&quot; or &quot;areas&quot;, see ); the Christian and Jewish areas of the city had grown considerably over the preceding centuries.

Despite the names, there was no governing principle of ethnic segregation: 30 percent of the houses in the Muslim quarter were rented out to Jews, and 70 percent of the Armenian quarter.

Below is a table of the historically recorded quarters of the city, from 1495 up until the modern system:

===Muslim Quarter===
The Muslim Quarter (, Hārat al-Muslimīn) is the largest and most populous of the four quarters and is situated in the northeastern corner of the Old City, extending from the Lions&#x27; Gate in the east, along the northern wall of the Temple Mount in the south, to the Western Wall – Damascus Gate route in the west. During the British Mandate, Sir Ronald Storrs embarked on a project to rehabilitate the Cotton Market, which was badly neglected under the Turks. He describes it as a public latrine with piles of debris up to five feet high. With the help of the Pro-Jerusalem Society, vaults, roofing and walls were restored, and looms were brought in to provide employment.

Like the other three quarters of the Old City, until the riots of 1929 the Muslim quarter had a mixed population of Muslims, Christians, and also Jews. Today, there are &quot;many Israeli settler homes&quot; and &quot;several yeshivas&quot;, including Yeshivat Ateret Yerushalayim, in the Muslim Quarter. Its population was 21,850 in 2020.

===Christian Quarter===
The Christian Quarter (, Ḩārat an-Naşāra) is situated in the northwestern corner of the Old City, extending from the New Gate in the north, along the western wall of the Old City as far as the Jaffa Gate, along the Jaffa Gate – Western Wall route in the south, bordering the Jewish and Armenian Quarters, as far as the Damascus Gate in the east, where it borders the Muslim Quarter. The quarter contains the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, viewed by many as Christianity&#x27;s holiest place. Its population was 3,870 in 2020.

=== Armenian Quarter ===
The Armenian Quarter (, Haygagan T&#x27;aġamas, , Ḩārat al-Arman) is the smallest of the four quarters of the Old City. Although the Armenians are Christian, the Armenian Quarter is distinct from the Christian Quarter. Despite the small size and population of this quarter, the Armenians and their Patriarchate remain staunchly independent and form a vigorous presence in the Old City. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the four quarters of the city came under Jordanian control. According to a 2007 study, the quarter housed 2,424 people (6.55% of Old City&#x27;s total). Its population was 2,160 in 2020.

===Jewish Quarter===

The Jewish Quarter (, &quot;HaRova HaYehudi&quot;, known colloquially to residents as &quot;HaRova&quot;, , &quot;Ḩārat al-Yahūd&quot;) lies in the southeastern sector of the walled city, and stretches from the Zion Gate in the south, bordering the Armenian Quarter on the west, along the Cardo to Chain Street in the north and extends east to the Western Wall and the Temple Mount. The quarter has a rich history, with several long periods of Jewish presence covering much of the time since the eighth century BCE. In 1948, its population of about 2,000 Jews was besieged, and forced to leave en masse. The quarter was completely bombed during the Battle for Jerusalem.

The Jewish quarter remained under Jordanian control until its recapture by Israeli paratroopers in the Six-Day War of 1967. A few days later, Israeli authorities ordered the demolition of the adjacent Moroccan Quarter, forcibly relocating all of its inhabitants, in order to facilitate public access to the Western Wall. 195 properties – synagogues, yeshivas, and apartments – were registered as Jewish and fell under the control of Jordan&#x27;s Custodian of Enemy Property. Most were occupied by Palestinian refugees expelled by Israeli forces from West Jerusalem and its contiguous villages until UNRWA and Jordan constructed the Shuafat Refugee Camp, where many were shifted, leaving most of the properties empty of inhabitants.

In 1968, after the Six Day War, Israel confiscated 12%, including the Jewish quarter and contiguous areas, of the Old City for public use. Some 80% of this confiscated infrastructure consisted of properties not owned by Jews. After reconstruction the parts of the quarter destroyed prior to 1967, these properties were then offered for sale exclusively to the Israeli and Jewish public. The prior owners mostly refused compensation, often because their properties were part of Islamic or family waqfs, which cannot be put up for sale. , the population stood at 2,348. Many large educational institutions have taken up residence. Before being rebuilt, the quarter was carefully excavated under the supervision of Hebrew University archaeologist Nahman Avigad. The archaeological remains are on display in a series of museums and outdoor parks, which tourists can visit by descending two or three stories beneath the level of the current city.

Its population was 3,240 in 2020.

=== Mughrabi Quarter ===
There was previously a small Mughrabi Quarter in the Old City. Within a week of the Six-Day War&#x27;s end, the quarter was largely destroyed in order to give visitors better access to the Western Wall by creating the Western Wall Plaza. The parts of the quarter that were not destroyed are now part of the Jewish Quarter. Simultaneously with the demolition, a new regulation was set into place by which the only access point for non-Muslims to the Temple Mount is through the Gate of the Moors, which is reached via the so-called Mughrabi Bridge.

==Gates==

During different periods, the city walls followed different outlines and had a varying number of gates. During the era of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem for instance, Jerusalem had four gates, one on each side. The current walls were built by Suleiman the Magnificent, who provided them with six gates; several older gates, which had been walled up before the arrival of the Ottomans, were left as they were. As to the previously sealed Golden Gate, Suleiman at first opened and rebuilt it, but then walled it up again as well. The number of operational gates was brought back to seven after the addition of the New Gate in 1887; a smaller one, popularly known as the Tanners&#x27; Gate, has been opened for visitors after being discovered and unsealed during excavations in the 1990s. The sealed historic gates comprise four that are at least partially preserved (the double Golden Gate in the eastern wall, and the Single, Triple, and Double Gates in the southern wall), with several other gates discovered by archaeologists of which only traces remain (the Gate of the Essenes on Mount Zion, the gate of Herod&#x27;s royal palace south of the citadel, and the vague remains of what 19th-century explorers identified as the Gate of the Funerals (Bab al-Jana&#x27;iz) or of al-Buraq (Bab al-Buraq) south of the Golden Gate).

Until 1887, each gate was closed before sunset and opened at sunrise. These gates have been known by a variety of names used in different historical periods and by different communities.

<doc id="302980" wikidata="Q168725" url="?curid=302980" title="John Oldcastle">
<text>Sir John Oldcastle (died 14 December 1417) was an English Lollard leader. From 1409 to 1413, he was summoned to parliament as Baron Cobham, in the right of his wife.

Being a friend of Henry V, he long escaped prosecution for heresy. When convicted, he escaped from the Tower of London and then led a rebellion against the King. Eventually, he was captured and executed in London. He formed the basis for William Shakespeare&#x27;s character John Falstaff, who was originally called John Oldcastle.

==Family==
Oldcastle&#x27;s date of birth is unknown, although dubious and possibly apocryphal sources place it variously at 1360 or 1378, although 1370 is most likely closer to the truth.

His parents were Richard and Isabel Oldcastle of Almeley, Herefordshire. His grandfather, also called John Oldcastle, was Herefordshire&#x27;s MP during the latter part of the reign of King Richard II.

==Early life==
Oldcastle is first mentioned in two separate documents in 1400, first as a plaintiff in a suit regarding the advowson of Almeley church, and again as serving as a knight under Lord Grey of Codnor in a military expedition to Scotland.

Over the next few years, Oldcastle held notable positions in the Welsh campaigns of King Henry IV of England against Owain Glyndŵr, including captaincy first over Builth Castle in Brecknockshire and then over Kidwelly.

Oldcastle represented Herefordshire as a &quot;knight of the shire&quot; in the parliament of 1404, later serving as a justice of the peace, and was High Sheriff of Herefordshire in 1406–07.

In 1408, he married Joan, the heiress of Cobham — his third marriage, and her fourth. This resulted in a significant improvement of his fortune and status, as the Cobhams were &quot;one of the most notable families of Kent&quot;. The marriage brought Oldcastle a number of manors in Kent, Norfolk, Northamptonshire and Wiltshire, as well as Cooling Castle, and from 1409 until his accusation in 1413 he was summoned to parliament as Lord Cobham.

At some point in his military career, Oldcastle became a trusted supporter of Henry, Prince of Wales, later to become King Henry V, who regarded Sir John as &quot;one of his most trustworthy soldiers&quot;.

Oldcastle was a member of the expedition which the young Henry sent to France in 1411 in a successful campaign to assist the Burgundians in the Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War.

==Lollardy==
Lollardy had many supporters in Herefordshire, and Oldcastle himself had adopted Lollard doctrines before 1410, when the churches on his wife&#x27;s estates in Kent were laid under interdict for unlicensed preaching. In the convocation which met in March 1413, shortly before the death of Henry IV, Oldcastle was at once accused of heresy.

But his friendship with the new King Henry V prevented any decisive action until convincing evidence was found in one of Oldcastle&#x27;s books, which was discovered in a shop in Paternoster Row, London. The matter was brought before the King, who desired that nothing should be done until he had tried his personal influence. Oldcastle declared his readiness to submit to the king &quot;all his fortune in this world&quot; but was firm in his religious beliefs.

When Oldcastle fled from Windsor Castle to his own castle at Cooling, Henry at last consented to a prosecution. Oldcastle refused to obey the archbishop&#x27;s repeated citations, and it was only under a Royal Writ that he at last appeared before the ecclesiastical court on 23 September 1413.

In a confession of his faith, Oldcastle declared his belief in the sacraments and the necessity of penance and confession addressed to God, but he would not assent to the orthodox doctrine of the sacraments as stated by the Bishops, nor admit the necessity for the Sacrament of Confession and Absolution being administered by a priest. He also said, similarly to the Iconoclasts of the Byzantine Empire and in contradiction of St John of Damascus, that the use of Christian art as an aid to prayer is, &quot;the great sin of idolatry&quot;. On 25 September, Oldcastle was convicted as a heretic and sentenced to execution by burning.

King Henry V was still anxious to find a means of sparing the life of his old comrade, and ordered a reprieve of forty days in the hopes that Oldcastle might repent his views. Before that time had expired, however, Oldcastle had escaped from the Tower with the help of one William Fisher, a Lollard parchment-maker from Smithfield.

==Open rebellion==

Oldcastle now put himself at the head of a widespread Lollard conspiracy. Despite the Christian pacifism preached by Wycliffe, the conspiracy were plotting regime change using violence and, if necessary, even civil war. The plan was to seize the King and his brothers in a palace coup during the Twelfth-night mumming at Eltham, and establish some sort of Commonwealth. Oldcastle would to be declared Regent, the king, English nobility and clergy would then be imprisoned. The religious orders would be forcibly dissolved and the property of the Catholic Church in England was to be divided up among the Lollards and used to create a new ruling class. King Henry, forewarned of Oldcastle&#x27;s intentions by two moles inside the Lollard movement, instead moved to London. When the Lollard army assembled in force in St Giles&#x27;s Fields on 10 January they were easily defeated by the king and the vastly superior numbers in his forces.

Oldcastle escaped into deepest northwest Herefordshire, and for nearly four years avoided capture.

He is believed to have been privy to the Southampton Plot in July 1415, when the Lollards pledged support and Oldcastle stirred some movement in the Welsh Marches. However, following the failure of the scheme he went again into hiding.

==Capture and death==
In November 1417 his hiding-place was at last discovered and he was captured by Edward Charleton, 5th Baron Cherleton. Some historians believed he was captured in the upland Olchon Valley of western Herefordshire adjacent to the Black Mountains, Wales, not far from the village of Oldcastle itself in his family&#x27;s old heartlands. He is said to have been hiding with some Lollard friends at a glade on Pant-mawr farm in Broniarth, Wales, called Cobham&#x27;s Garden.

The principal agents in the capture were four of the tenants of Edward Charleton, 5th Baron Cherleton, two of them being Ieuan and Sir Gruffudd Vychan, sons of Gruffudd ap Ieuan.

Oldcastle who was &quot;sore wounded ere he would be taken&quot;, was brought to London in a horse-litter. The reward for his capture was awarded to Baron Cherleton, but he died before receiving it, though a portion was paid to his widow in 1422.

On 14 December he was formally condemned, on the record of his previous conviction, and that same day was hanged in St Giles&#x27;s Fields, and burnt &quot;gallows and all&quot;. It is not clear whether he was burnt alive for heresy or whether he was hanged, drawn, and quartered for high treason first.

==Literary portrayals==
His heretical opinions and early friendship with Henry V created a traditional scandal which long continued. In the old play &quot;The Famous Victories of Henry V&quot;, written before 1588, Oldcastle figures as the Prince&#x27;s boon companion. When Shakespeare adapted that play in &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, Oldcastle still appeared, but when the play was printed in 1598, the name was changed to Falstaff (modelled after Sir John Fastolf), due to the objections of one of Oldcastle&#x27;s highly influential descendants, the Queen&#x27;s official censor of stage plays Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham.

Although Shakespeare&#x27;s drunken, morbidly obese, and hedonistic excuse for a medieval knight still remains &quot;my old lad of the Castle&quot;, the stage character has many differences from the Lollard rebel leader. In &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; an epilogue alleges that Falstaff is not meant to be Oldcastle: &quot;Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless already a&#x27; be killed with your hard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man.&quot; In 1599, another play, &quot;Sir John Oldcastle&quot;, presented Oldcastle in a far less negative light.

==Bibliography==
The record of Oldcastle&#x27;s trial is printed in &quot;Fasciculi Zizaniorum&quot; (Rolls series) and in David Wilkins&#x27;s &quot;Concilia&quot;, iii. 351–357. The chief contemporary notices of his later career are given in &quot;Gesta Henrici Quinti&quot; (&quot;Eng. Hist. Soc.&quot;) and in Walsingham&#x27;s &quot;Historia Anglicana&quot;. There have been many lives of Oldcastle, mainly based on &quot;The Actes and Monuments&quot; of John Foxe, who in his turn followed the &quot;Briefe Chronycle&quot; of John Bale, first published in 1544.

<text>The Golden Gate or Gate of Mercy (&quot;;&quot; ) is the only eastern gate of the Temple Mount, and one of only two Gates of the Old City of Jerusalem that used to offer access into the city from the East side.

The gate has been sealed since 1541, the most recent of several sealings. Its interior can be accessed from the Temple Mount.

In Jewish tradition, the Messiah will enter Jerusalem through this gate, coming from the Mount of Olives. Christians and Muslims generally believe that this was the gate through which Jesus entered Jerusalem.

==Names==
Each of the two doors of this double-gate has its own name: (&#x27;Gate of Mercy&#x27;) for the southern one, and (&#x27;Gate of Repentance&#x27;) for the northern one.

Another Arabic name is the &quot;Gate of Eternal Life&quot;.

In the Mishnah (Middot 1:3), the eastern gate of the Second Temple compound is called the &quot;Shushan Gate&quot; (). If the Golden Gate does preserve the location of the Shushan Gate, the concept being based of an exposed ancient arch, most possibly of a former gate, which lies directly beneath the blocked entranceway of the Golden Gate, this would make it the oldest of the gates in Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City Walls. Jewish and Christian tradition attributes its construction to King Solomon, but there is no archaeological or historical evidence of its being that old.

In the 14th century, Ishtori Haparchi testified in his book &quot;Kaftor va-Ferach&quot; that the Jews referred to the site as the &quot;Gates of Mercy&quot;: &quot;&quot;And the masses call it &#x27;Sha&#x27;arei Rachamim&#x27; (Gates of Mercy), and the Ishmaelites have become accustomed to this and call it &#x27;Bab al-Rahma&#x27;&quot;.&quot;

The modern Hebrew name of the Golden Gate is &quot;Sha&#x27;ar HaRachamim&quot; ().

==History==
===Early history===
The Golden Gate is located in the northern third of the Temple Mount&#x27;s Eastern Wall. The eastern wall now visible was built in at least four stages, during the reign of Hezekiah, during the time of Zerubbabel, in the Hasmonean period and famously in the Herodian period. The present Golden Gate is thought to have been built on top of ruins of an earlier gate in the Eastern Wall. An arch, most possibly of a former gate, lies directly beneath the blocked entranceway of the Golden Gate.

The 1st-century historian, Josephus, mentions an &quot;eastern gate&quot; in his &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, and makes note of the fact that this gate was considered within the far northeastern extremity of the inner sacred court. The Mishnah mentions a former causeway which led out of the Temple Mount eastward over the Kidron valley, extending as far as the Mount of Olives. Rabbi Eliezer, dissenting, says that it was not a causeway, but rather marble pillars over which cedar boards had been laid, used by the High Priest and his entourage. This gate, known as the &quot;Shushan Gate&quot;, was not used by the masses to enter the Temple Mount, but reserved only for the High Priest and all those that aided him when taking out the Red Heifer or the scapegoat on Yom Kippur.

=== The present gate ===
The construction date of the present-day Golden Gate is unknown, as Muslim authorities forbid archaeological work at the Temple Mount. The vast majority of the 19th and early 20th century scholars such as Robinson, Conder, Bartlett, Vincent and Abel, Melchior de Vogüé and Creswell dated the gate to different periods prior to the Islamic period. Later, in the light of developing research, new arguments have been advanced by many scholars such as Hamilton, Sharon, Ben-Dov, Rozen Ayalon, Tsafrir and Wilkinson that the gate should be dated to the 7th–8th century AD, to the Umayyad period. Today, opinions are shared between a late Byzantine and an early Umayyad date.

According to some scholars, the present gate was built circa 520 AD, during the Byzantine period, as part of Justinian I&#x27;s building program in Jerusalem, on top of the ruins of the earlier gate in the wall. An alternative theory holds that it was built in the later part of the 7th century by Byzantine artisans employed by the Umayyad Caliphs.

The Dutch archaeologist Leen Ritmeyer, who explored the gate in the 1970s, reached the conclusion that the two monolithic massive gateposts seen on the inside of the gate belong to an old structure of the gate, thought to be the &quot;Shushan Gate&quot; (mentioned in Mishnah &quot;Middot&quot; 1:3 as being the only gate in the Eastern Wall), and that it dates from the First Temple period. Philosopher Maimonides wrote in his Code of Jewish Law that, during the time of the Second Temple, &quot;one entering from the East Gate of the Temple Mount would walk on level ground till the end of the Rampart. From the Rampart he would ascend 12 steps to the Court of Women, the height of each step being half a cubit and its tread half a cubit.&quot;

===The sealing of the gate===

Closed by the Muslims in 810, reopened in 1102 by the Crusaders, it was walled up by Saladin after regaining Jerusalem in 1187. Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent rebuilt it together with the city walls, but walled it up in 1541, and it stayed that way.

Suleiman may have taken this decision purely for defensive reasons, but in Jewish tradition this is the gate through which the Anointed One (Messiah) will enter Jerusalem. In relation to the Muslim belief Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah, it is suggested that Suleiman the Magnificent sealed off the Golden Gate to prevent a false Messiah or &quot;Antichrist&quot; coming through the entrance. The Ottomans also built a cemetery in front of the gate to prevent a false precursor to the Anointed One, Elijah, from passing through the gate. This belief was based upon two premises. First, according to Islamic teaching Elijah is a descendant of Aaron, making him a priest or kohen. Second, that a Jewish kohen is not permitted to enter a cemetery. This second premise is not wholly correct because a Kohen is permitted to enter a cemetery in which either Jews or non-Jews are buried, such as the one outside the Golden Gate, as long as certain laws or Halakha regarding purity are followed.

=== Ottoman Era ===
During the Ottoman era, the inner recess (vestibule) built within the western side of the Golden Gate was used for brick burning, which bricks were then used to renovate buildings and structures in the &quot;Haram esh-Sharif&quot; (Temple Mount enclosure). A small mosque was built near the Golden Gate to cater to the brick burners, but which was later destroyed, along with part of the Gate&#x27;s wall, by order of the Sultan in the 19th-century in order to make room for renovations. A new wall and two new arches were added to the Gate&#x27;s western interior. The gate house, which is accessed from the Temple Mount by descending a wide flight of stairs leading into it, and where the current ground floor is built in the shape of a rectangle measuring × (exterior wall measurements), is surrounded by walls, the length of which space being divided by a row of columns forming two equal divisions. Below the ground level, inside a tomb, can be seen the top of an ancient arch (the lower stones still buried underground), the existence of which leads to the conclusion that the original ground level was much lower than what it is today.

The Ottoman Turks transformed the walled-up gate into a watchtower.

=== Modern history ===
Access to the Golden Gate from within the Temple Mount was sealed off by Israeli authorities in 2003 because the group managing the area had ties to Hamas. The gate was kept closed in order to stop illegal construction work there by the Islamic Waqf. Israeli officials believe the work led to the destruction of antiquities from periods of Jewish presence in the area.

In February 2019, the interior of the gate was reopened for Muslim worshipers from the Temple Mount. However, the gate itself still remains sealed.

== Description ==
The Golden Gate is a rectangular stonework structure with two decorated facades. Unlike other gates in al-Aqsa enclave, the eastern façade was not built level with the wall of the enclave, but projects two meters out from the wall.

The Golden Gate has two passages. The two bays are reflected in its plan and main elevations; two doorways are followed by a double passage covered by three pairs of domes. On the ground floor level a vaulted hall is divided by four columns into two aisles, which lead to the Door of Mercy, Bab al-Rahma, and the Door of Repentance, Bab al-Taubah; an upper floor room has the two roof domes as its ceiling.

Originally, the eastern facade of the Golden Gate had two large doorways, separated by a column. Each doorway measures 3.90 metres in width, supporting a semicircular arch with a decorated frieze. The doorways in the eastern facade were blocked up in the Ottoman period. It is noticed that some features in the decoration of the Golden Gate bear a close resemblance to the decoration in other non-Muslim buildings that existed in the Levant.

The openings of the Golden Gate lead to a rectangular domed vestibule, measuring in length and in width (interior wall measurements). At that time, the hall consisted of six shallow domes, which have elliptical shape, two of which were changed later. These domes are separated by arches of an elliptical shape springing from two pilasters at the entrances and two central columns. Each dome in the Golden Gate is constructed over a square plan, so special stones are required to form the successive stone circles that form the dome. Architecturally, the spatial treatment of the gate is somewhat interesting; shifting the facade 2 metres out of the wall indicates a clear definition of its location. The most important question concerning this gate is the matter of motive.

==Symbolism==
Since the early times of Muslim rule over the holy region Bayt al-Maqdis, some Muslims, such as ‘Ubadah ibn al-Samit, linked the eastern wall of the enclave with the Last Day. According to Ibn Kathir, this wall is not the wall mentioned in the Quranic verse &quot;so a wall will be put up betwixt them, with a gate therein&quot; [57:13], but it was mentioned by some commentators as an example for the clarification of the meaning of the verse. Since that time, this example probably encouraged Muslims to bury their dead immediately outside the eastern wall of the al-Aqsa enclave. In any case, if the name &quot;al-Rahmah&quot; (Mercy) truly exists since the construction of the gate, this suggests that the gate is part of an overall concept based on the idea related to the place, specifically the Rock, as that of the Last Day. Then it can be argued that Bab al-Rahmah symbolises a gate in paradise or an entry to Mercy (Ratrout, 2004, p. 293). Whatever the construction motive of Bab al-Rahmah might have been, it was built during the early Islamic period, and it is the most significant gate of the enclave.

According to Jewish tradition, the Shekhinah (שכינה) (Divine Presence) used to appear through the eastern Gate, and will appear again when the Anointed One (Messiah) comes (Ezekiel 44:1–3) and a new gate replaces the present one; that might be why Jews used to pray in medieval times for mercy at the former gate at this location, another possible reason being that in the Crusader period, when this habit was first documented, they were not allowed into the city where the Western Wall is located. Hence the name &quot;Gate of Mercy&quot;.

In Christian apocryphal texts, the gate was the scene of the meeting between the parents of Mary, so that the gate became the symbol of the Immaculate Conception of Mary and Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate became a standard subject in cycles depicting the Life of the Virgin. Some equate it with the Beautiful Gate mentioned in Acts 3; though many others would disagree with that identification. It appears the basis for equating the Golden Gate with the Beautiful Gate in Acts &quot;is a result of the confusion between the Latin &quot;aurea&quot; (golden) with the Greek &quot;horaios&quot; (beautiful).&quot; However, this is only a supposition; there is no evidence for this, which some scholars are careful to point out. For example, Denys Pringle stated, &quot;however, by a confusion that may have had something to do with the similarity between the Greek ὡραία and the Latin &quot;aurea&quot;, from the seventh century onwards it was more usually identified in Latin sources as the Golden Gate.&quot;

It is also said that Jesus, riding on a donkey, passed through this gate on Palm Sunday, in fulfillment of the Jewish prophecy concerning the Messiah (Ezekiel 44:1-3). The Synoptic Gospels appear to support this belief by indicating Jesus came down from the direction of the Mount of Olives and immediately arrived at the Temple Mount (Mark 11:1, 11:11). The Gospel of John alternatively suggests the Pharisees were watching the arrival, possibly from the Temple Mount. Those who believe the &quot;Golden Gate&quot; to be a fulfillment of a prophecy in the book of Ezekiel (44:1-3) &quot;spiritualize&quot; these words (i.e., using Typical, Figurative or Allegorical interpretation).

However, Biblical scholars using the Historical-Grammatical method of interpretation (basically, reading a book for the meaning its author intended) point out that the context of chapters 40-46 do not refer to either a city gate during the time of Jesus nor one today, but rather to a temple gate in which &quot;the glory of the LORD filled the temple (43:5 RSV)&quot; and &quot;will dwell in the midst of the people of Israel for ever (43:7 RSV)&quot;. Thus, as Dyer points out, some interpret chapters 40 ff. of Ezekiel as &quot;prophesying about the church in a figurative sense; he did not have a literal temple in mind.&quot; Whereas others see these passages as referring to a &quot;still-future literal temple.&quot;

==In Christian culture==
Honoring the Jewish tradition (see above) and inspired by apocryphal accounts of the life of the Virgin Mary, medieval Christian artists depicted the relationship of Jesus&#x27; maternal grandparents Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate. The couple came to represent the Christian ideal of chastity in conjugal relations within marriage. The pious custom of a bridegroom carrying his bride across the threshold of their marital home may be based in the traditional symbolism of the Golden Gate to the faithful. In medieval art, the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of the mother of Christ was commonly depicted in images of the Virgin and Child with Saint Anne (in Italian the &quot;Metterza&quot;), the three generations of grandmother, mother, and son.

The metaphor also features heavily in the personalist phenomenology of Pope John Paul II, his &quot;Theology of the Body,&quot; a collection of reflections on this theme Crossing the Threshold of Hope were written to encourage the Roman Catholic faithful facing the challenges of materialism and increasing secularism and published on the cusp of the new millennium in 1998. The threshold between the earthly and heavenly realms symbolized by the Golden Gate represents the Mystical Body of the Church, often viewed as the Bride of Christ.

In Christian eschatology, sunrise in the east symbolizes both Christ&#x27;s resurrection at dawn on Easter Sunday and the direction of his Second Coming. Sanctuaries for Christian congregational worship at an altar are often arranged with respect to the east. City gates in Christian urban centers often contain religious artifacts intended to guard the city from attacks and to bless travelers. The Ostra Brama in Vilnius, Lithuania contains an icon of Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn, which is venerated by both Roman Catholic and Orthodox inhabitants.

== Topography east of the Old City ==
The Golden Gate is one of the few sealed gates in Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City Walls, along with the Huldah Gates, and a small Biblical and Crusader-era postern located several stories above ground on the southern side of the eastern wall.

<doc id="302989" wikidata="Q1490929" url="?curid=302989" title="Gadsby (novel)">
<text>Gadsby is a 1939 novel by Ernest Vincent Wright, written without words that contain the letter E, the most common letter in English. A work that deliberately avoids certain letters is known as a lipogram. The plot revolves around the dying fictional city of Branton Hills, which is revitalized as a result of the efforts of protagonist John Gadsby and a youth organizer.

Though vanity published and little noticed in its time, the book has since become a favorite of fans of constrained writing and is a sought-after rarity among some book collectors. The first edition carries on title page and cover the subtitle &quot;A Story of Over 50,000 Words Without Using the Letter &quot;E&quot;&quot; (with the variant &quot;50,000 Word Novel Without the Letter &quot;E&quot;&quot; on the dust jacket), sometimes dropped from late reprints.

==Lipogrammatic quality==
In the introduction to the book (which, not being part of the story, does contain the letter &#x27;e&#x27;), Wright says his primary difficulty was avoiding the &quot;-ed&quot; suffix for past tense verbs. He made extensive use of verbs that do not take the -ed suffix and constructions with &quot;do&quot; and &quot;did&quot; (for instance &quot;did walk&quot; instead of &quot;walked&quot;). Scarcity of word options also drastically limited discussion involving quantityWright could not write about any number between six and thirtypronouns, and many common words.

An article in the linguistic periodical &quot;Word Ways&quot; said that 250 of the 500 most commonly used words in English were still available to Wright despite the omission of words with &quot;e&quot;.

Wright uses abbreviations on occasion, but only if the full form is similarly lipogrammatic, e.g. &quot;Dr.&quot; (Doctor) and &quot;P.S.&quot; (postscript) would be allowed but not &quot;Mr.&quot; (Mister).

Wright also turns famous sayings into lipograms. Instead of William Congreve&#x27;s original line, &quot;Musick has charms to soothe a savage breast&quot;, Wright writes that music &quot;hath charms to calm a wild bosom.&quot; John Keats&#x27; &quot;a thing of beauty is a joy forever&quot; becomes &quot;a charming thing is a joy always&quot;. In other respects, Wright does not avoid topics which would otherwise require the letter &quot;e&quot;; for example, a detailed description of a horse-drawn fire engine is made without using the words &quot;horse&quot;, &quot;fire&quot;, or &quot;engine&quot;.

==Plot and structure==
John Gadsby, 50, is alarmed by the decline of his hometown, Branton Hills, and rallies the city&#x27;s youth to form an &quot;Organization of Youth&quot; to build civic spirit and improve living standards. Despite some opposition, Gadsby and his youthful army transform Branton Hills from a stagnant town into a bustling, thriving city. Towards the book&#x27;s conclusion, members of Gadsby&#x27;s organization receive diplomas honoring of their work. Gadsby becomes mayor and helps grow Branton Hills&#x27; population from 2,000 to 60,000.

The story starts around 1906 and continues through World War I, Prohibition, and President Warren G. Harding&#x27;s administration. &quot;Gadsby&quot; is divided into two parts: the first, about a quarter of the book&#x27;s total length, is strictly a history of the city of Branton Hills and John Gadsby&#x27;s place in it, while the second part of the book fleshes out its main characters.

The novel is written from the point of view of an anonymous narrator, who continually complains about his poor writing skills and often uses circumlocution. &quot;Now, naturally, in writing such a story as this, with its conditions as laid down in its Introduction, it is not surprising that an occasional &#x27;rough spot&#x27; in composition is found&quot;, the narrator says. &quot;So I trust that a critical public will hold constantly in mind that I am voluntarily avoiding words containing that symbol which is, by far, of most common inclusion in writing our Anglo-Saxon as it is, today&quot;.

===Example prose===
The book&#x27;s opening two paragraphs are:

==Publication and composition==
Wright appears to have worked on the manuscript for several years. Though its official publication date is 1939, references in newspaper humor columns are made to his manuscript of a book without an &quot;e&quot; years earlier. Prior to publication he occasionally referred to his manuscript as &quot;Champion of Youth&quot;. In October 1930, while Wright was living near Tampa, Florida, he wrote a letter to &quot;The Evening Independent&quot; newspaper, boasted that he had written a fine lipogrammatic work, and suggested the paper hold a lipogram competition, with $250 for the winner. The paper turned him down.

Wright struggled to find a publisher for the book, and eventually used Wetzel Publishing Co., a self-publishing press. A 2007 post on the &quot;Bookride&quot; blog about rare books says a warehouse holding copies of &quot;Gadsby&quot; burned shortly after the book was printed, destroying &quot;most copies of the ill fated novel&quot;. The blog post says the book was never reviewed &quot;and only kept alive by the efforts of a few avant garde French intellos and assorted connoisseurs of the odd, weird and zany&quot;. The book&#x27;s scarcity and oddness has seen original copies priced at $4,000 to $7,500 by book dealers. Wright died the same year of publication, 1939.

In 1937, Wright said writing the book was a challenge and the author of an article on his efforts in &quot;The Oshkosh Daily&quot; recommended composing lipograms for insomnia sufferers. Wright said in his introduction to &quot;Gadsby&quot; that &quot;this story was written, not through any attempt to attain literary merit, but due to a somewhat balky nature, caused by hearing it so constantly claimed that &#x27;it can&#x27;t be done&#x27;&quot;. He said he tied down the &quot;e&quot; key on his typewriter while completing the final manuscript. &quot;This was done so that none of that vowel might slip in, accidentally; and many did try to do so!&quot; And in fact, the 1939 printing by the Wetzel Publishing Co. contains four such slips, the word &quot;the&quot; on pages 51, 103 and 124, and the word &quot;officers&quot; on page 213.

==Reception and influence==

In her 1943 novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, Ayn Rand satirically imagines a &quot;Council of American Writers&quot;, who include &quot;...a youth who had written a thousand-page novel without a single letter o...&quot;

&quot;La Disparition&quot; (&quot;A Void&quot;) is a 1969 lipogrammatic French novel partly inspired by &quot;Gadsby&quot; that likewise omits the letter &quot;e&quot; and is 50,000 words long. Its author, Georges Perec, was introduced to Wright&#x27;s book by a friend of his in Oulipo, a multinational constrained-writing group. Perec was aware from Wright&#x27;s lack of success that publication of such a work &quot;was taking a risk&quot; of finishing up &quot;with nothing [but] a &quot;Gadsby&quot;&quot;. As a nod to Wright, &quot;La Disparition&quot; contains a character named &quot;Lord Gadsby V. Wright&quot;, a tutor to protagonist Anton Voyl; in addition, a composition attributed to Voyl in &quot;La Disparition&quot; is actually a quotation from &quot;Gadsby&quot;.

Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s 1997 book &quot;Le Ton beau de Marot&quot; quotes parts of &quot;Gadsby&quot; for illustration.

An article in the &quot;Oshkosh Daily&quot; in 1937 wrote (lipogrammatically) that the manuscript was &quot;amazingly smooth. No halting parts. A continuity of plot and almost classic clarity obtains&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote a humor column about &quot;Gadsby&quot;. Author Ed Park jokingly aped Wright&#x27;s style: &quot;Lipogram aficionados—folks who lash words and (alas!) brains so as to omit particular symbols—did in fact gasp, saying, &#x27;Hold that ringing communication tool for a bit! What about J. Gadsby?&#x27;&quot;. David Crystal, host of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s linguistics program &quot;English Now&quot;, called it &quot;probably the most ambitious work ever attempted in this genre&quot;. Trevor Kitson, writing in New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;Manawatu Standard&quot; in 2006, said he was prompted to write a short lipogram after seeing Wright&#x27;s book. The attempt gave him an appreciation for how difficult Wright&#x27;s task was, but he was less impressed with the result. &quot;It seems extraordinarily (not that it uses that word, of course) and mostly about all-American kids going to church and getting married&quot; he wrote.

<text>John Aubrey (12 March 1626 – 7 June 1697) was an English antiquary, natural philosopher and writer. He was a pioneer archaeologist, who recorded (often for the first time) numerous megalithic and other field monuments in southern England, and who is particularly noted for his systematic examination of the Avebury henge monument. The Aubrey holes at Stonehenge are named after him, although there is considerable doubt as to whether the holes that he observed are those that currently bear the name. He was also a pioneer folklorist, collecting together a miscellany of material on customs, traditions and beliefs under the title &quot;Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme&quot;. He set out to compile county histories of both Wiltshire and Surrey, although both projects remained unfinished. His &quot;Interpretation of Villare Anglicanum&quot; (also unfinished) was the first attempt to compile a full-length study of English place-names. He had wider interests in applied mathematics and astronomy, and was friendly with many of the greatest scientists of the day.

Aubrey was the author of &quot;Brief Lives&quot;, a collection of short biographical pieces. For much of the 19th and 20th centuries, thanks largely to the popularity of &quot;Brief Lives&quot;, Aubrey was regarded as little more than an entertaining but quirky, eccentric and credulous gossip. Only in the 1970s did the full breadth and innovation of his scholarship begin to be more widely appreciated. He published little in his lifetime, and many of his most important manuscripts (for the most part preserved in the Bodleian Library) remain unpublished, or published only in partial form.

== Early life ==

Aubrey was born at Easton Piers or Percy, near Kington St Michael, Wiltshire, to a long-established and affluent gentry family with roots in the Welsh Marches. His maternal grandfather, Isaac Lyte, lived at Lytes Cary Manor, Somerset, now owned by the National Trust. Richard Aubrey, his father, owned lands in Wiltshire and Herefordshire. For many years an only child, he was educated at home with a private tutor, he was &quot;melancholy&quot; in his solitude. His father was not intellectual, preferring field sports (hunting) to learning. Aubrey read such books as came his way, including Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot;, and studied geometry in secret. 

Aubrey was educated at the Malmesbury grammar school under Robert Latimer. (Latimer had numbered the philosopher Thomas Hobbes among his earlier pupils, and Aubrey first met Hobbes, whose biography he would later write, at Latimer&#x27;s house.) He then studied at the grammar school at Blandford Forum, Dorset.

Aubrey entered Trinity College, Oxford, in 1642, but his studies were interrupted by the English Civil War. His earliest antiquarian work dates from this period in Oxford. In 1646 he became a student of the Middle Temple. He spent a pleasant time at Trinity in 1647, making friends among his Oxford contemporaries, and collecting books. He spent much of his time in the country.

In 1649, Aubrey discovered the megalithic remains at Avebury, which he later mapped and discussed in his important antiquarian work &quot;Monumenta Britannica&quot;. He was to show Avebury to Charles II at the King&#x27;s request in 1663. His father died in 1652, leaving Aubrey large estates, but with them some complicated debts.

== Career ==
Aubrey said his memory was &quot;not tenacious&quot; by 17th-century standards but from the early 1640s he kept thorough (if haphazard) notes of observations in natural philosophy, his friends&#x27; ideas, and antiquities. He began to write &quot;Lives&quot; of scientists in the 1650s. 

In 1659, Aubrey was recruited to contribute to a collaborative county history of Wiltshire, leading to his unfinished collections on the antiquities and the natural history of the county. His erstwhile friend and fellow-antiquary Anthony Wood predicted that he would one day break his neck while running downstairs in haste to interview some retreating guest or other. Aubrey was an apolitical Royalist, who enjoyed the innovations characteristic of the Interregnum period while deploring the rupture in traditions and the destruction of ancient buildings brought about by civil war and religious change. He drank the King&#x27;s health in Interregnum Herefordshire, but with equal enthusiasm attended meetings in London of the republican Rota Club.

In 1663, Aubrey became a member of the Royal Society. He lost estate after estate due to lawsuits, until 1670 when he parted with his last piece of property and ancestral home, Easton Piers. From this time he was dependent on the hospitality of his numerous friends; in particular, Sir James Long, 2nd Baronet, and his wife Lady Dorothy of Draycot House, Wiltshire. 

In 1667, Aubrey had made the acquaintance of Anthony Wood at Oxford, and when Wood began to gather materials for his &quot;Athenae Oxonienses&quot;, Aubrey offered to collect information for him. From time to time he forwarded memoranda in a uniquely casual, epistolary style, and in 1680 he began to promise the work &quot;Minutes for Lives&quot;, which Wood was to use at his discretion.

== Death ==

Aubrey died of an apoplexy while travelling, in June 1697, aged 71, and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary Magdalen, Oxford.

== Biographical methods ==

Aubrey approached the work of the biographer much as his contemporary scientists had begun to approach the work of empirical research by the assembly of vast museums and small collection cabinets. Collating as much information as he could, he left the task of verification largely to Wood, and thereafter to posterity. As a hanger-on in great houses, he had little time and little inclination for systematic work, and he wrote the &quot;Lives&quot; in the early morning while his hosts were sleeping off the effects of the night before. These texts were, as Aubrey entitled them, &quot;Schediasmata&quot;, &quot;pieces written extempore, on the spur of the moment&quot;. Time after time, he leaves marks of omission in the form of dashes and ellipses for dates and facts, inserting fresh information whenever it is presented to him. The margins of his notebooks are dotted with notes-to-self, most frequently the Latin &quot;quaere&quot;. This exhortation, to &quot;go and find out&quot; is often followed. In his life of Thomas Harcourt, Aubrey notes that one Roydon, a brewer living in Southwark, was reputed to be in possession of Harcourt&#x27;s petrified kidney: &quot;I have seen it&quot;, he writes approvingly; &quot;he much values it&quot;.

Aubrey himself valued the evidence of his own eyes above all, and he took great pains to ensure that, where possible, he noted not only the final resting places of people, but also of their portraits and papers. Though his work has frequently been accused of inaccuracy, this charge is misguided. In most cases, Aubrey simply wrote what he had seen, or heard. When transcribing hearsay, he displays a careful approach to the ascription of sources. For example, in his life of Thomas Chaloner (who, Aubrey notes, was himself fond of spreading rumours in the concourse of Westminster Hall, coming back after lunch to find them changed), he recorded an inaccurate and bawdy anecdote about Chaloner&#x27;s death, but subsequently found it to be in fact about James Chaloner. Aubrey let the initial story stand in his text, while highlighting the error in a marginal note.

== Works ==

=== &quot;Brief Lives&quot; ===

In 1680, Aubrey began work on his collection of biographical sketches, which he entitled &quot;Schediasmata: Brief Lives&quot;. He presented them to Anthony Wood in 1681 but continued to work on them until 1693, when he deposited his manuscripts (in three folio volumes) in the Ashmolean Museum: they are now in the Bodleian Library, as MSS Aubrey 6–8.

As private, manuscript texts, the &quot;Lives&quot; were able to contain the richly controversial material which is their chief interest today, and Aubrey&#x27;s chief contribution to the formation of modern biographical writing. When he allowed Anthony Wood to use the texts, however, he entered the caveat that much of the content of the Lives was &quot;not fitt to be let flie abroad&quot; while the subjects and the author were still living.

Aubrey&#x27;s relationship with Wood was to become increasingly fraught. Aubrey asked Wood to be &quot;my index expurgatorius&quot;: a reference to the Church&#x27;s list of banned books, which Wood seems to have taken not as a warning, but as a licence to simply extract pages of notes to paste into his own proofs. In 1692, Aubrey complained bitterly that Wood had mutilated forty pages of his manuscript, perhaps for fear of a libel case. Wood was eventually prosecuted for insinuations against the judicial integrity of the school of Clarendon. One of the two statements called in question was founded on information provided by Aubrey and this may explain the estrangement between the two antiquaries and the ungrateful account that Wood gives of Aubrey&#x27;s character. It is now famous: &quot;a shiftless person, roving and magotie-headed, and sometimes little better than crased. And being exceedingly credulous, would stuff his many letters sent to A. W. with folliries and misinformations, which would sometimes guid him into the paths of errour&quot;.

A large part of the &quot;Lives&quot; was published in 1813 as &quot;Letters Written by Eminent Persons in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries&quot;. A near-complete transcript, &quot;Brief Lives, Chiefly of Contemporaries, Set Down by John Aubrey, Between the Years 1669 and 1696&quot;, was edited for the Clarendon Press in 1898 by the Rev. Andrew Clark. This remained the standard edition for scholarly use for many years, but (from a modern perspective) was flawed by the number of excisions Clark had made in the interests of &quot;decency&quot;. In the 20th century, a number of more popular editions appeared, which often included the expurgated passages, but were in other respects far more selective: these included versions edited by John Collier (under the title &quot;The Scandal and Credulities of John Aubrey&quot;; 1931), Anthony Powell (1949), Oliver Lawson Dick (1949), Richard Barber (1975), and John Buchanan-Brown (2000; with an introduction by Michael Hunter). The most scholarly and complete edition, and now the standard edition for reference purposes, is Kate Bennett (ed.), &quot;Brief Lives with An Apparatus for the Lives of our English Mathematical Writers&quot; (2 volumes, Oxford, 2015), which was described on publication by Michael Hunter as &quot;the edition we have been waiting for&quot;.

The &quot;Lives&quot; present a number of difficult editorial problems as to what should be included or excluded, and how best to present the material. A controversial book for its time, &quot;Lives&quot; bluntly mocked the scandalous lives of eminent figures. For instance, Aubrey wrote of John Milton: &quot;His complexion exceeding faire—he was so faire that they called him the Lady of Christ&#x27;s College.&quot; He wrote of William Butler: &quot;The Dr. lying at the Savoy in London, next the water side where was a balcony look&#x27;t into the Thames, a patient came to him that was grievously tormented with an ague. The Dr. orders a boat to be in readiness under his window, and discoursed with the patient (a gent) in the balcony, when on a signal given, 2 or 3 lusty fellows came behind the gent, and threw him a matter of 20 feet into the Thames. This surprise absolutely cured him.&quot; Of Ben Jonson: &quot;He lies buried in the north aisle in the path of square stone … with this inscription only on him, in a pavement square of blue marble about 14&quot; square; O RARE BEN JONSON.&quot; Of William Shakespeare: &quot;His comedies will remain wit as long as the English tongue is understood, for that he handles mores hominum [the ways of mankind]. Now our present writers reflect so much on particular persons and coxcombeities that twenty years hence they will not be understood.&quot; Aubrey also wrote of Francis Bacon that &quot;he was a Pederast.&quot;

At somewhat greater length, Aubrey also wrote a life of the philosopher Thomas Hobbes (author of &quot;Leviathan&quot;), entitled &quot;The Life of Mr Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury&quot;: this is now Bodleian MS Aubrey 9. It is often grouped with the &quot;Brief Lives&quot;, but is really a separate and self-contained work. It served as the basis for Richard Blackburne&#x27;s Latin biography, &quot;Vitae Hobbianae auctarium&quot;, published in 1681. The life of Hobbes was included in Clark&#x27;s 1898 edition of &quot;Brief Lives&quot;, but not in Bennett&#x27;s 2015 edition.

=== &quot;Monumenta Britannica&quot; ===

The &quot;Monumenta Britannica&quot; was Aubrey&#x27;s principal collection of archaeological material, written over some thirty years between about 1663 and 1693. It falls into four parts: (1) &quot;Templa Druidum&quot;, a discussion of supposed &quot;druidic&quot; temples, notably Avebury and Stonehenge; (2) &quot;Chorographia Antiquaria&quot;, a survey of other early urban and military sites, including Roman towns, &quot;camps&quot; (hillforts), and castles; (3) a review of other archaeological remains, including sepulchral monuments, roads, coins and urns; and (4) a series of more analytical pieces, including four exercises attempting to chart the chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval architecture, costume, and shield-shapes. Of these last, the essay on architecture, &quot;Chronologia Architectonica&quot;, written in 1671, was the most detailed, and (although in its unpublished state it remained little known) is now regarded as a highly perceptive milestone in the development of architectural history.

The manuscript of &quot;Monumenta Britannica&quot; is now Bodleian MSS Top.Gen.c.24 and 25. An edition of the first three parts (reproduced, following unorthodox editing principles, partly in facsimile, and partly in printed transcript) was published by John Fowles and Rodney Legg in two volumes in 1980–82. This edition has, however, been criticised for doing Aubrey &quot;less than justice&quot; on various grounds: for a failure to consolidate what were essentially drafts and working notes into a coherent whole, for silent omissions and rearrangements, for inadequate and occasionally inaccurate annotation, and for the omission of the important fourth part of the work.

=== Wiltshire ===
Aubrey began work on compiling material for a natural historical and antiquarian study of Wiltshire in 1656. Independently, in 1659, a self-appointed committee of Wiltshire gentry determined that a county history should be produced on the model of William Dugdale&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities of Warwickshire&quot;. It was agreed that Aubrey would deal with the northern division of the county.

Aubrey chose to divide the work into two separate projects, on the antiquities and the natural history of the county respectively. The work on the antiquities (which he entitled &quot;Hypomnemata Antiquaria&quot;) was closely modelled on Dugdale, and was largely finished by 1671: Aubrey deposited his draft in the Ashmolean Museum in two manuscript volumes. Unfortunately, one of these was withdrawn by his brother in 1703 and subsequently lost. He then turned to the county&#x27;s natural history. Some of his interim observations were read to the Royal Society in 1668 and 1675–6. In 1685 Aubrey recast the work, now modelling it on Robert Plot&#x27;s &quot;Natural History of Oxford-shire&quot; (published in 1677); and it was effectively finished by 1690–91, when he transcribed a fair copy. Shortly afterwards the Royal Society commissioned another transcript, at a cost of £7. In 1693 Aubrey asked his brother William Aubrey and Thomas Tanner to bring the project to completion, but despite their best intentions they failed to do so.

The manuscript of the &quot;Naturall Historie&quot; is now Bodleian MSS Aubrey 1 and 2. The Royal Society&#x27;s copy, which includes material (mainly on supernatural phenomena) that Aubrey afterwards removed from his own manuscript, is now Royal Society MS 92. The surviving manuscript of the &quot;Antiquities&quot; is now Bodleian MS Aubrey 3. A highly selective edition of the &quot;Naturall Historie&quot; was published by John Britton in 1847 for the Wiltshire Topographical Society. The &quot;Antiquities&quot; were published (again, with certain omissions) by John Edward Jackson in 1862 as &quot;Wiltshire: the Topographical Collections of John Aubrey&quot;.

==== Editions ====

=== &quot;Perambulation of Surrey&quot; ===
In 1673, the royal cosmographer and cartographer John Ogilby, planning a national atlas and chorography of Britain, licensed Aubrey to undertake a survey of Surrey. Aubrey carried out the work, but in the event Ogilby&#x27;s project was curtailed, and he did not use the material. Aubrey, however, continued to add to his manuscript until 1692.

The manuscript is now Bodleian MS Aubrey 4. In a much-revised form (with both additions and excisions) it was published by Richard Rawlinson as the &quot;Natural History and Antiquities of Surrey&quot; in five volumes in 1718–19.

=== &quot;Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme&quot; ===
The &quot;Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme&quot; was Aubrey&#x27;s collection of material on customs, traditions, ceremonies, beliefs, old wives&#x27; tales and rhymes—or what today would be termed folklore. It was compiled over many years, but written up between 1687 and 1689.

The manuscript came into the hands of White Kennett, and as a result it is not with Aubrey&#x27;s other collections in the Bodleian: it is in the British Library, as Lansdowne MS 231. An edition was published by James Britten for the Folklore Society in 1881. It was more satisfactorily re-edited in 1972 by John Buchanan-Brown.

=== &quot;Interpretation of Villare Anglicanum&quot; ===
Aubrey&#x27;s &quot;Interpretation of Villare Anglicanum&quot; (its preface dated 31 October 1687) was the first attempt to devote a work entirely to the subject of English place-names. It is, however, unfinished (or, as Gillian Fellows-Jensen observes, &quot;hardly begun&quot;). Aubrey compiled a list of some 5,000 place-names, but managed to provide derivations for only a relatively small proportion of them: many are correct, but some are wildly wrong. The manuscript is now Bodleian MS Aubrey 5.

=== &quot;Miscellanies&quot; ===
The only work published by Aubrey in his lifetime was his &quot;Miscellanies&quot; (1696; reprinted with additions in 1721), a collection of 21 short chapters on the theme of &quot;hermetick philosophy&quot; (i.e. supernatural phenomena and the occult), including &quot;Omens&quot;, &quot;Prophesies&quot;, &quot;Transportation in the Air&quot;, &quot;Converse with Angels and Spirits&quot;, &quot;Second-Sighted Persons&quot;, etc. Its contents mainly comprised documented reports of supernatural manifestations. The work did much to bolster Aubrey&#x27;s posthumous reputation as a superstitious and credulous eccentric.

=== Other works ===
Aubrey&#x27;s papers also included &quot;Architectonica Sacra&quot;; and &quot;Erin Is God&quot; (notes on ecclesiastical antiquities).

Aubrey&#x27;s &quot;Adversaria Physica&quot; was a scientific commonplace book, which by 1692 amounted to a folio &quot;an inch thick&quot;. It is lost, although extracts have survived in the form of copies.

Aubrey wrote two plays, both comedies intended for Thomas Shadwell. The first has not survived; the second, &quot;Countrey Revell&quot;, remained unfinished.

== In popular culture ==
In 1967, English director Patrick Garland created a one-man show, &quot;Brief Lives&quot;, based on Dick&#x27;s edition of Aubrey&#x27;s work. Starring Roy Dotrice, it became the most successful one-man production ever seen, with Dotrice giving over 1800 performances across forty years on both sides of the Atlantic. For many, the play became an essential means of understanding a &quot;vanished time&quot; and one version of it. Aubrey scholars, however, have sometimes seen the production as over-emphasising its subject&#x27;s eccentricities and lack of organisation, to the detriment of a wider appreciation of his contributions to scholarship.

In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Stones of Blood&quot; (1978)—which features a neolithic stone circle—the Fourth Doctor quips, &quot;I always thought that Druidism was founded by John Aubrey in the seventeenth century as a joke. He had a great sense of humour, John Aubrey.&quot;

In 2008, &quot;Aubrey&#x27;s Brief Lives&quot; was a five-part drama serial on Radio 4. Writer Nick Warburton intertwined some of Aubrey&#x27;s biographical sketches with the story of the turbulent friendship between Aubrey and Anthony Wood. Abigail le Fleming produced and directed.

In 2015, Ruth Scurr published &quot;John Aubrey: My Own Life&quot;, a semi-fictional &quot;diary&quot; or &quot;autobiography&quot; of Aubrey, which draws heavily on Aubrey&#x27;s own surviving scattered writings (with minor adaptation and modernisation), but is essentially an artificial construction by Scurr.

<doc id="302997" wikidata="Q132269" url="?curid=302997" title="Howl's Moving Castle (novel)">
<text>Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle is a fantasy novel by Welsh author Diana Wynne Jones, first published in 1986 by Greenwillow Books of New York. It was a runner-up for the annual Boston Globe–Horn Book Award, and won the Phoenix Award twenty years later. It was adapted into an animated film of the same name in 2004, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle is the first novel in the series of books called the Howl Series. This series also includes &quot;Castle in the Air&quot;, published in 1990, and &quot;House of Many Ways&quot;, published in 2008. WorldCat reports that &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; is the author&#x27;s work most widely held in participating libraries, followed by its first sequel &quot;Castle in the Air&quot;.

For the idea Jones &quot;very much&quot; thanked &quot;a boy in a school I was visiting&quot;, whose name she had noted but lost and forgot. He had &quot;asked me to write a book titled &quot;The Moving Castle&quot;&quot;.

==Plot summary==
18-year-old Sophie Hatter is the eldest of three sisters living in Market Chipping, a town in the magical kingdom of Ingary, where fairytale tropes are accepted ways of life, including that the eldest of three will never be successful. As the eldest, Sophie is resigned to a dull future running the family hat shop. Unbeknownst to her, she is able to talk life into objects. When the powerful Witch of the Waste considers her a threat and turns her into an old crone, Sophie leaves the shop and finds work as a cleaning lady for the notorious wizard Howl. She strikes a bargain with Howl&#x27;s fire demon, Calcifer: if she can break the contract between Howl and Calcifer, then Calcifer will return her to her original youthful form. Part of the contract, however, stipulates that neither Howl nor Calcifer can disclose the main clause, leaving Sophie to figure it out on her own.

Sophie learns that Howl, a rather self-absorbed and fickle but ultimately good-natured person, spreads malicious rumours about himself to avoid work and responsibility. The door to his castle is actually a portal that opens onto four places: Market Chipping, the seaside city of Porthaven, the royal capital of Kingsbury, and Howl&#x27;s boyhood home in modern day Wales where he was named Howell Jenkins. Howl&#x27;s apprentice Michael Fisher runs most of the day-to-day affairs of Howl&#x27;s business, while Howl chases his ever-changing paramours.

When Prince Justin, the King&#x27;s younger brother, goes missing while searching for Wizard Suliman, the King orders Howl to find them both and kill the Witch of the Waste. Howl, however, has his own reasons to avoid the Witch; the Witch, a jilted former lover, has laid a dark curse on him. He successfully continues to avoid her until she lures Sophie into a trap. Believing the Witch has taken Howl&#x27;s current love interest, Miss Angorian, Sophie goes to save her and is captured by the Witch. Howl spends hours in the bathroom every day primping himself to look handsome for girls; Michael had said that the day he does not do this is the day Michael will believe that Howl is truly in love. So when Howl comes to save Sophie, unshaven and a mess, it demonstrates his love for her. He kills the Witch and reveals that Miss Angorian was actually the Witch&#x27;s fire demon in disguise; the fire demon had taken control of the Witch and was attempting to create a &quot;perfect human&quot; by fusing Wizard Suliman and Prince Justin. It was to be completed by the addition of Howl&#x27;s head.

At the castle, Miss Angorian takes hold of Calcifer to capture Howl&#x27;s heart. Howl had given his heart to Calcifer. This was the contract between them; the heart kept Calcifer alive, and in return Calcifer put his magic at Howl&#x27;s disposal. Sophie uses her ability of bringing things to life to free Calcifer, thus breaking the contract between him and Howl. With his heart restored, Howl destroys the witch&#x27;s fire demon, freeing Suliman and Justin. Calcifer, as promised, breaks Sophie&#x27;s spell and she returns to her proper age. Howl had realized early on that Sophie was under a spell and secretly attempted to remove the curse; when he had met with failure, he&#x27;d figured Sophie simply enjoyed &quot;being in disguise&quot;.

Calcifer returns, preferring to stay with Howl. Sophie and Howl admit they love each other when Howl suggests they live happily ever after.

==Setting==

===Ingary===
Most of the novel is set in a fictional monarchy, Ingary; its capital is Kingsbury. Much of south-eastern Ingary is harsh wilderness referred to as &quot;The Waste&quot;. Ingary is bordered by Strangia to the east and the Sultanates of Rashpuht to the south. Nearby is the country of High Norland; in the middle of the novel, the King of Ingary mentions that Ingary will likely be attacked by both Strangia and High Norland soon.

Before the move, the castle wanders over the hills between Market Chipping and Upper Folding in the north. Howl&#x27;s house is in fact based in a seaside town named Porthaven; Howl also occupies a disguised stable in Kingsbury. Chapter Eleven takes place in Wales. After the move, the castle sits at the edge of the Waste and Howl&#x27;s house is moved to Sophie&#x27;s childhood home in Market Chipping; they also occupy a grand but derelict mansion in Vale End (which is in the same valley as Market Chipping).

===Howl&#x27;s moving castle===
Howl&#x27;s castle is a tall, black building with four thin black turrets. It seems to be made of blocks of coal (a suitable habitat for a fire demon) and is &quot;bespelled to hold together&quot;. It seems to have four doors on the outside, although three are made inaccessible by an invisible wall.

The inside of the castle is made of the house where Calcifer is based, which is Howl&#x27;s house in Porthaven at first, then the house by the hat shop in Market Chipping after the move in Chapter Seventeen. A &quot;square wooden knob above the door, set into the lintel, with a dab of paint on each of its four sides&quot; allows one to open the door into four different locations. Initially these locations are: the moving castle in the hills above Market Chipping (green); in Porthaven (blue); in Kingsbury (red); and in Wales (black). However, after Howl is forced into hiding he changes the door&#x27;s destinations to: in Market Chipping (yellow); in Vale End (orange); a garden in the waste (purple); and in Wales (black).

Before the move, the window over the workbench and the one in Michael&#x27;s front room overlook Porthaven. Afterwards, the downstairs window looks out on a street in Market Chipping. The one in Howl&#x27;s bedroom overlooks his sister&#x27;s garden in Wales.

==Characters==

===Sophie Hatter===
Sophie Hatter, the eldest of the Hatter sisters (18), has red hair and is rather pretty, though she doesn&#x27;t perceive herself as such. She becomes more lovely as her confidence grows. While her siblings&#x27; lives become adventurous and exciting, she finds herself resigned to run her father&#x27;s old hat shop, as it is her &quot;fate&quot; as the oldest sister. One day the Witch of the Waste, mistaking Sophie for Lettie, turns her into an old woman. Sophie leaves the shop and becomes a cleaning lady in Howl&#x27;s castle, hoping that he might be able to lift the curse placed on her by the Witch. As the story progresses, she starts to fall in love with Howl, though she does her best to deny it. When Howl begins &quot;courting&quot; Miss Angorian, Sophie is hurt by this.

Though Sophie is initially reserved and lacking confidence, she demonstrates herself to be a strong-minded individual after she is transformed into an old woman, becoming less afraid of what others think of her. Dutiful, kind, and considerate, Sophie also has a tendency to be impulsive in her actions and often feels guilty when she does something wrong, though her attempts to rectify matters are usually disastrous. She can be temperamental and argumentative. She possesses some magic of her own – she is capable of imbuing magic into items by simply talking to them, though she initially is unaware of her abilities.

===Wizard Howl===
Wizard Howl (27) is a mysterious, reclusive wizard, with a terrible reputation. He is known by a number of aliases; by birth, he is Howell Jenkins, but he goes by &quot;Wizard Jenkins&quot; in Porthaven and his preferred &quot;Howl Pendragon&quot; in Kingsbury. When Howl was young, he gave Calcifer his heart in order for the fire demon to continue living because he felt sorry for him - this is implied to have sapped his humanity somewhat, and will continue to do so till he ends up like the Witch of the Waste. He is 27 (he states that he will soon be 10,000 days old, which is part of the Witch&#x27;s curse) and known for being &quot;wicked&quot;. He comes from Wales, a country unknown to most in the book, where his family remains unaware of his activities in Sophie&#x27;s world or of its existence; his sister is annoyed by his disappearances, but he often visits them when troubled. He confesses to Sophie that he is a real coward and the only way he can get himself to do something he doesn&#x27;t want to is to tell himself that he won&#x27;t do it.

Despite his reputation, Howl is in reality an endearing, charming man who is intelligent, considerate, if somewhat self-appreciative, dishonest, and careless at times. He enjoys &quot;slithering out&quot; of uncomfortable situations, often in comical ways. Despite his cowardice, he is an incredibly powerful wizard, capable of matching the Witch of the Waste and is only not known as such because he wants to avoid the work that comes with the respect. His bond with Calcifer increases his powers.

Howl is tall and suave, fond of dyeing his hair, and wearing impressive suits. He spends at least two hours in the bathroom every morning. He is described by Calcifer as &quot;vain for a plain man with mud-coloured hair&quot;. His vanity causes him to throw hysterical fits when Sophie meddles with his clothes or potions. Howl is not naturally handsome, but has &quot;charm&quot;, both literally and figuratively. He is modelled on the Byronic hero.

===Calcifer===
Calcifer is Howl&#x27;s resident fire-demon. As the result of a mysterious bargain with Howl some years ago, he agrees to heat and power the castle. Although he is bound to the hearth, he has a great amount of magic. He promises to use his magic to break the curse on Sophie, providing she breaks the contract between him and Howl. Howl describes Calcifer as &quot;his weakest point&quot;, because Calcifer wouldn&#x27;t give away another demon if it entered the castle, even if it had hostile intentions. However, Howl&#x27;s statement is true in more ways than one.

Calcifer is powerful, but can be just as cowardly as Howl, preferring to run from the Witch rather than fight her. However, he, also like Howl, will fight when the need arises. He is also fairly crabby and a little mean-spirited, which stems from being bound to the hearth in the moving castle for over five years. He has a natural fear of water, and also worries quite frequently about running out of logs, which are essentially his food. Sophie seems to be the only one capable of forcing him to do anything he doesn&#x27;t want to do, a trait she also extends to Howl, and to a lesser extent, Michael as well.

He is also the first one to recognise Sophie&#x27;s incredible ability to talk life into the world around her, which is the reason he allowed her into the castle in the first place and was so eager to make a bargain with her – if anyone but she were to break the contract he had with Howl, then Calcifer would die. Fortunately, she is able to talk life into him, and he survives losing Howl&#x27;s heart, even deciding to continue living with them after he is freed. Despite his misgivings, Calcifer is the most perceptive and intelligent character in the Castle, repeatedly dropping clever hints regarding Howl being &quot;heartless&quot; (which he uses in literal and figurative meanings), and not hesitating to give clues on Howl&#x27;s capricious nature.

Calcifer&#x27;s appearance is described as having a thin blue face, a thin blue nose, curly green flames for hair and eyebrows, a purple flaming mouth, and savage teeth. His eyes are described as orange flames with purple pupils. He does not have any evident lower body.

=== Michael Fisher ===
Michael Fisher is Howl&#x27;s 15-year-old apprentice. He originally lived in Porthaven until both his parents died, leaving him an orphan. He had to leave his house because he couldn&#x27;t pay the rent and slept on Howl&#x27;s doorstep. Howl found him there one morning and told him to stay inside whilst he went out. Michael started talking to Calcifer and he believes that Howl was impressed with this when he returned. Howl didn&#x27;t tell him to stay but he also never told him to leave, so Michael started helping out of his own accord. He eventually became Howl&#x27;s apprentice, and he does his best to make sure that Howl doesn&#x27;t spend all their money. He often goes to Cesari&#x27;s, a bakery in Market Chipping, where he buys pies and other baked goods. He met Martha there and fell in love with her. Sophie later realises that she saw Michael at Cesari&#x27;s on May Day before she was cursed by the Witch of the Waste. He&#x27;s described by Sophie as &quot;a nice boy, but a bit helpless in a crisis&quot;. He&#x27;s rather nice and patient but isn&#x27;t quite as fast-thinking as Howl, therefore making Mrs. Penstemmon say he was &quot;not clever enough to cause her concern&quot;.

===The Witch of the Waste===
The Witch of the Waste is one of the most powerful magicians in all of Ingary. She was banished by the late King to The Waste fifty years before the story starts for causing havoc in the country. She and Howl had a brief relationship (while she was disguised as a beautiful young woman) which led to him leaving her hurriedly. Angered by this, the Witch cursed Howl, so that after a sequence of unlikely events he would have to return to the Witch. She also puts a spell on Sophie at the start of the story, turning her into an old crone. The Witch is also revealed to have made a supposedly perfect man out of the combined parts of Wizard Suliman and Prince Justin, intending to complete the body with Howl&#x27;s head and make the man King of Ingary and herself queen. She is killed by Howl at the end of the book.

===Other characters===
* Lettie Hatter is Sophie&#x27;s seventeen-year-old sister. She is considered the most beautiful of the three Hatter sisters, and has dark hair and blue eyes. Initially, she is an apprentice at Cesari&#x27;s, a pastry shop in Market Chipping, but because she wishes to learn magic, she and Martha switch places using a temporary appearance altering spell. A strong minded young woman, Lettie becomes fond of a stray dog which is in fact a bespelled Wizard Suliman. When she finds out Sophie has been bespelled and lives in Howl&#x27;s castle, she sends the dog to protect Sophie from Howl&#x27;s charm. Howl tries to woo Lettie, but upon discovering that Lettie is the bespelled Sophie&#x27;s sister, he begins approaching Lettie to ask questions about Sophie instead. At the end of the novel, she is taken as an apprentice by Ben Sullivan, where a romantic attachment is hinted.
* Martha Hatter is Sophie&#x27;s youngest sister and thought of as the smartest of the three. She is slender and fair with big grey eyes. Fanny arranges her to become Mrs Fairfax&#x27;s apprentice, though Martha and Lettie switch appearances temporarily to switch places. Martha happily works as an apprentice at Cesari&#x27;s, a renowned pastry shop, and her ambition is to get married and have ten children. She loves Michael Fisher. When Howl laments that he loves Lettie Hatter, Michael hurries to Cesari&#x27;s to learn if Martha, still disguised as Lettie, has been courted by Howl. Martha assures him she has never met Howl and Michael knows she isn&#x27;t lying because she &#x27;twiddled her thumbs the whole time&#x27;, and she only stops doing that when she lies.
* Fanny Hatter is Mr Hatter&#x27;s second wife. She used to be the youngest, prettiest shop assistant in the hat shop. She is Martha&#x27;s mother and is kind to all three girls. When she is widowed, she takes charge of the hat shop and places Lettie and Martha in promising apprenticeships, whilst keeping Sophie to trim hats. Shortly after Sophie disappears, she marries a wealthy man, Mr Sacheverell Smith (possibly thanks to a hat Sophie charmed), moves to a grand mansion in Vale End and sells the hat shop to Howl. She continues to worry about Sophie, who mysteriously disappeared, and is relieved and happy when they meet again.
* The King of Ingary employs Howl to produce transport spells. When the Witch of the Waste threatens his baby daughter Valeria, he sends Suliman the Royal Wizard to the Waste to deal with the Witch. When the King&#x27;s brother disappears whilst looking for Wizard Suliman, he asks Howl to look for the missing men and get rid of the Witch of the Waste. He then appoints Howl as the Royal Wizard, a move which creates a bad mood in the household of the moving castle.
* Prince Justin is the younger brother of the King of Ingary. Unsettled by Suliman&#x27;s disappearance, he sets off to find him only to go missing himself. The King of Ingary describes Justin as a brilliant general; with threats of war looming from both Strangia and High Norland, the King of Ingary becomes anxious and insistent that Prince Justin be found.
* Mrs Penstemmon is a grand, talented old witch. She taught Mrs Fairfax, Suliman, and finally Howl; she is also mentioned as the teacher of Matilda, the Witch of Montalbino, in &quot;House of Many Ways&quot;. She is proud of Howl&#x27;s talent and wants him to be a good person but she is concerned he is heading the same way as the Witch of the Waste. When Sophie visits her while pretending to be Howl&#x27;s mother, Mrs Penstemmon encourages Sophie to break the contract between Howl and Calcifer. She detects Sophie&#x27;s magical gift and sees instantly that she&#x27;s cursed, but cannot lift the Witch&#x27;s spell. She is killed by the Witch of the Waste when she refuses to tell the Witch where Howl is.
* Wizard Suliman is the Royal Wizard and personal advisor to the King of Ingary. He originally comes, like Howl, from Wales, where he was known as Benjamin Sullivan. He was Mrs Penstemmon&#x27;s second-to-last pupil. When the Witch threatens the King of Ingary&#x27;s young daughter, he is dispatched to the Waste by the King. There he starts growing bushes and flowers in an attempt to reduce her power, but the Witch catches him. He projects most of his magic onto a scarecrow, which Sophie will talk life into. The Witch puts him to pieces and sells off his skull and guitar. She reassembles his body with parts of Prince Justin&#x27;s (the head in particular) and calls him Gaston. She uses him to find out about Wales to get to Howl, then casts a spell on him that turns him into a dog. Calcifer guesses that one of his aliases is Percival. He takes on Lettie as an apprentice, because he is at least as strong-willed as she is.
* Mrs Annabel Fairfax is a witch, a former pupil of Mrs Penstemmon&#x27;s. A widow, she lives in Upper Folding and is a friend of Fanny&#x27;s. She is &quot;a plump, comfortable lady, with swathes of butter-coloured hair&quot;. She is chatty and uses home-made honey in her spells. She discovers quickly that Martha and Lettie have switched places, but accepts Lettie as her apprentice anyway and encourages her to accept Howl&#x27;s advances and become his pupil, though Lettie eventually chooses Suliman instead. Though she tries, she is unable to lift the curse placed on Percival (see below).
* Lily Angorian is an attractive schoolteacher in Wales who claims to be Benjamin Sullivan&#x27;s fiancée. As such, she refuses to allow Howl to court her, though Sophie comes to believe that Howl is infatuated with her. She is later revealed to be the Witch of Waste&#x27;s fire demon, and tries to take Howl&#x27;s heart when the Witch of the Waste is killed. With the destruction of the Witch&#x27;s heart, she is killed.
* Percival is the witch&#x27;s footman in the beginning, constructed from Suliman and Justin, though she calls him &quot;Gaston&quot;, but she later curses him to be a dog. For this reason, he is called &quot;dog-man&quot; before his name is revealed. He can briefly turn into a man, but can barely get a few sentences out before turning back into a dog, though always a different breed than he was before. In human form he is a nervous red-headed man with a crinkled brown suit. He, for a brief time, was with Lettie and Mrs. Fairfax before being sent to Sophie. When he and Lettie meet later, they seem to get along swimmingly.

==Major themes and genre==
&quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; explores several themes, including: destiny, youth, courage and love. The first two are central to Sophie&#x27;s progression. Early on, her perceived notion of destiny makes her believe that she is doomed to fail because she is the eldest of three sisters. This is in contrast to Howl, who sees himself as the master of his own fate, unafraid of what society thinks of him or what their conventions demand. Sophie&#x27;s self-perceived failure is reflected in the Witch of the Waste&#x27;s spell, which causes her outward appearance to become old and dull.

=== New Mythology ===
Many scholars have referred to &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; as New Mythology. New Mythology is largely defined by the emergence of a new heroic archetype that transcends old cultural contexts and confronts them with modern ideals. Proponents of classifying &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; as New Mythology present Sophie Hatter as one such heroine who follows this archetype. While Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle builds on its predecessor myths such as &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, it often subverts many of the tropes within them. For example, in the first few lines of the novel, Jones situates Sophie&#x27;s position in mythology as being born the eldest of three and doomed to &quot;fail first&quot;. This contrasts with the sisters of &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, where the youngest prevails in each tale. An additional characteristic of New Mythology that is also present in &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; is its proximity to the real world. Jones often depicts this by using feelings of heterotopia as a feature within her stories. One such example is the door in the castle that opens to what is eventually recognized as Wales. This allows characters within the story to view our world from an outsiders perspective.

===Inversion of the crone archetype===
Traditionally, the binary typology of the characters in fairy tales is strictly based on representations of good and evil. In &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot;, both Howl and Sophie&#x27;s distinction between being good or evil is often blurred. This is exemplified in Jones reversing the roles of &#x27;Beauty&#x27; and &#x27;Beast&#x27; within the novel by depicting Howl as young and handsome, while having Sophie be cursed and transformed into an old crone. Representations of the witch or crone in western European mythology have been stereotypically negative as they are often depicted as ugly and malevolent. Sophie at one point in the story is even misidentified as villain, The Witch of the Waste. In having Sophie take on the role of an old crone, she is freed from several traditional myth archetypes such as maiden, wife, or mother. Many moments in the novel highlight Sophie&#x27;s newfound freedom in old age. One such example noting she would have been &quot;shriveled with embarrassment&quot; at her actions if she were still a young girl. Rather, it is the loss of her girlhood that empowers Sophie to recover her own agency and start her heroine&#x27;s journey. Unlike stories of the past, &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; presents the role of witch/crone in a heroic light. Though Sophie breaks her curse and returns to normal, she retains the power and insight she has gained throughout the story.

==Allusions and references to other works==

The novel makes references to many other works of literature.

John Donne is alluded to twice, first in Chapter 10 when Howl refers to the first line of John Donne&#x27;s poem , saying &quot;Busy old fool, unruly Sophie.&quot; Howl makes a reference to Donne again in Chapter 11, when Miss Angorian reads from his poem . The poem also serves as the inspiration for the terms of Howl&#x27;s curse.

In Chapter 11 there is a sign on Megan&#x27;s house labelled &quot;Rivendell&quot;, the &quot;Last Homely House&quot; in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. In Chapter 12 there is a reference to &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; when Howl tells Sophie &quot;We can&#x27;t all be Mad Hatters.&quot; Howl refers to &quot;Hamlet&quot; in Chapter 17 when he quotes &quot;Alas, poor Yorick!&quot; and &quot;She heard mermaids, so it follows that something is rotten in the state of Denmark. I have an everlasting cold, but luckily I&#x27;m terribly dishonest. I cling to that.&quot;; another &quot;Hamlet&quot; reference occurs at the beginning of Chapter 11 referring to the nothingness in the doorway to Wales as being &quot;only an inch-thick after all&quot;.

The names of Suliman&#x27;s alias Percival, and Howl&#x27;s brother-in-law Gareth are two of the Knights of the Round Table, while Howl&#x27;s own alias, Pendragon, is derived from King Arthur&#x27;s father, King Uther&#x27;s epithet. The Witch of the Waste&#x27;s name is a possible pun on the Witch of the West from the novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; and its subsequent film.

A traditional Welsh folk song, &quot;Sosban Fach&quot;, is referred several times in the novel as &quot;Calcifer&#x27;s silly saucepan song&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Film===

The novel was adapted into a 2004 animated film, written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli. The film was critically acclaimed, broke box office records in Japan, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

===Radio===
Robert Valentine wrote an adaptation for Bafflegab and BBC Radio 4, which broadcast on 12 December 2021. It starred Julia McKenzie and Dakota Blue Richards as the old and young Sophies respectively, Iwan Rheon as Howl, Angus Imrie as the King, and Dan Starkey as Calcifer.

==Awards and nominations==
In 1986 &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; was one of two runners-up for the annual Boston Globe-Horn Book Award in Fiction, behind &quot;In Summer Light&quot; by Zibby Oneal. It was also named one of that year&#x27;s ALA Notable Books for Children.

Jones and Howl won the annual Phoenix Award from the Children&#x27;s Literature Association in 2006, recognising the best children&#x27;s book published twenty years earlier that did not win a major award. Allusion to the mythical bird phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes, suggests the winning book&#x27;s rise from obscurity.

<doc id="303005" wikidata="Q478301" url="?curid=303005" title="Hussite Wars">
<text>The Hussite Wars, also called the Bohemian Wars or the Hussite Revolution, were a series of civil wars fought between the Hussites and the combined Catholic forces of Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, the Papacy, and European monarchs loyal to the Catholic Church, as well as various Hussite factions. At a late stage of the conflict, the Utraquists changed sides in 1432 to fight alongside Roman Catholics and opposed the Taborites and other Hussite factions. These wars lasted from 1419 to approximately 1434.

The unrest began after pre-Protestant Christian reformer Jan Hus was executed by the Catholic Church in 1415 for heresy. Because Sigismund had plans to be crowned the Holy Roman Emperor (requiring papal coronation), he suppressed the religion of the Hussites, yet it continued to spread. When King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, brother of Sigismund, died of natural causes a few years later, the tension stemming from the Hussites grew stronger. In Prague and various other parts of Bohemia, the Catholic Germans living there were forced out.

Wenceslaus&#x27;s brother, Sigismund, who had inherited the throne, was outraged by the spread of Hussitism. He received permission from the pope to launch a crusade against the Hussites, and large numbers of crusaders came from all over Europe to fight. They made early advances, forcing the Hussites back and taking Prague. However, the Hussites reorganized and took back nearly all the land they had lost, resulting in the failure of the crusade.

After the reins of the Hussite army were handed over to yeoman Jan Žižka, internal strife followed. Seeing that the Hussites were weakened, the Germans undertook another crusade but were defeated by Žižka at the Battle of Německý Brod. Three more crusades were attempted by the papacy, but none achieved their objectives. The Lithuanians and Poles did not wish to attack the Czechs, Germany was having internal conflicts and could not muster up a sufficient force to battle the Hussites, and the king of Denmark left the Czech border to go back to his home. As the conflicts went on, the Hussites also made raids into German territory.

The wars eventually ended in 1434 when the moderate Utraquist faction of the Hussites defeated the radical Taborite faction. The Hussites agreed to submit to the authority of the king of Bohemia and the Roman Catholic Church and were allowed to practice their somewhat variant rite.

The Hussite community included much of the Czech population of the Kingdom of Bohemia and formed a major spontaneous military power. The Hussite Wars were notable for the extensive use of early handheld firearms such as hand cannons and of wagon forts by the Hussites.

==Origins==
Starting around 1402, priest and scholar Jan Hus denounced what he judged as the corruption of the church and the papacy, and he promoted some of the reformist ideas of English theologian John Wycliffe. His preaching was widely heeded in Bohemia, and provoked suppression by the church, which had declared many of Wycliffe&#x27;s ideas heretical. In 1411, in the course of the Western Schism, &quot;Antipope&quot; John XXIII proclaimed a &quot;crusade&quot; against King Ladislaus of Naples, the protector of rival Pope Gregory XII. To raise money for this, he proclaimed indulgences in Bohemia. Hus bitterly denounced this and explicitly quoted Wycliffe against it, provoking further complaints of heresy but winning much support in Bohemia.

In 1414, Sigismund of Hungary convened the Council of Constance to end the Schism and resolve other religious controversies. Hus went to the Council, under a safe-conduct from Sigismund, but was imprisoned, tried, and executed on 6 July 1415. The knights and nobles of Bohemia and Moravia, who were in favour of church reform, sent the &quot;protestatio Bohemorum&quot; to the Council of Constance on 2 September 1415, which condemned the execution of Hus in the strongest language. This angered Sigismund, who was &quot;King of the Romans&quot; (head of the Holy Roman Empire, though not yet Emperor) and brother of King Wenceslaus of Bohemia. He had been persuaded by the Council that Hus was a heretic. He sent threatening letters to Bohemia declaring that he would shortly drown all Wycliffites and Hussites, greatly incensing the people.

Disorder broke out in various parts of Bohemia and drove many Catholic priests from their parishes. Almost from the beginning, the Hussites were divided into two main groups, though many minor divisions also arose among them. Shortly before his death, Hus had accepted the doctrine of Utraquism preached during his absence by his adherents at Prague: the obligation of the faithful to receive communion in both kinds, bread and wine (&quot;sub utraque specie&quot;). This doctrine became the watchword of the moderate Hussites known as the Utraquists or Calixtines, from the Latin &quot;calix&quot; (the chalice), in Czech &quot;Kališníci&quot; (from &quot;kalich&quot;). The more extreme Hussites became known as Taborites (&quot;Táborité&quot;), after the town of Tábor, which became their centre; or Orphans (&quot;Sirotci&quot;), a name they adopted after the death of their leader and general Jan Žižka.

Under the influence of Sigismund, Wenceslaus endeavoured to stem the Hussite movement. A number of Hussites led by Mikuláš of Hus left Prague. They held meetings in various parts of Bohemia, particularly at Sezimovo Ústí, near the spot where the town of Tábor was founded soon afterwards. At these meetings, they violently denounced Sigismund, and the people everywhere prepared for war.

In spite of the departure of many prominent Hussites, the troubles at Prague continued. On 30 July 1419, a Hussite procession headed by the priest Jan Želivský attacked New Town Hall in Prague and threw the king&#x27;s representatives, the burgomaster, and some town councillors from the windows into the street (the first &quot;Defenestration of Prague&quot;), where several were killed by the fall, after a rock was allegedly thrown from the town hall and hit Želivský. It has been suggested that Wenceslaus was so stunned by the defenestration that it caused his death on 16 August 1419. Alternatively, it is possible that he may have just died of natural causes.

==Outbreak of fighting==
The death of Wenceslaus resulted in renewed troubles in Prague and in almost all parts of Bohemia. Many Catholics, mostly Germans—mostly still faithful to the Pope—were expelled from the Bohemian cities. Wenceslaus&#x27;s widow Sophia of Bavaria, acting as regent in Bohemia, hurriedly collected a force of mercenaries and tried to gain control of Prague, which led to severe fighting. After a considerable part of the city had been damaged or destroyed, the parties declared a truce on 13 November. The nobles, sympathetic to the Hussite cause, but supporting the regent, promised to act as mediators with Sigismund, while the citizens of Prague consented to restore to the royal forces the castle of Vyšehrad, which had fallen into their hands. Žižka, who disapproved of this compromise, left Prague and retired to Plzeň. Unable to maintain himself there he marched to southern Bohemia. He defeated the Catholics at the Battle of Sudoměř (25 March 1420), the first pitched battle of the Hussite Wars. After Sudoměř, he moved to Ústí, one of the earliest meeting places of the Hussites. Not considering its situation sufficiently strong, he moved to the neighboring new settlement of the Hussites, called by the biblical name of Tábor.

Tábor soon became the center of the most militant Hussites, who differed from the Utraquists by recognizing only two sacraments—Baptism and Communion—and by rejecting most of the ceremony of the Roman Catholic Church. The ecclesiastical organization of Tabor had a somewhat puritanical character, and the government was established on a thoroughly democratic basis. Four captains of the people (&quot;hejtmané&quot;) were elected, one of whom was Žižka, and a very strict military discipline was instituted.

==Use of war wagons and firearms==
Late 14th and early 15th century saw gradually increasing use of firearms in siege operations both by defenders and attackers. Weight, lack of accuracy and cumbersome use of early types limited their employment to static operations and prevented wider use in open battlefield or by civilian individuals. Nevertheless, lack of guild monopolies and low training requirements led to their relatively low price. This together with high effectiveness against armour led to their popularity for castle and town defenses.

When the Hussite revolt started in 1419, the Hussite militias heavily depended on converted farm equipment and weapons looted from castle and town armories, including early firearms. Hussite militia comprised mostly commoners without prior military experience and included both men and women. Use of crossbows and firearms became critical as those weapons didn&#x27;t require extensive training, nor did their effectiveness rely on the operator&#x27;s physical strength.

Firearms were first used in the field as a provisional last resort together with wagon forts. Significantly outnumbered Hussite militia led by Jan Žižka repulsed surprise assaults by heavy cavalry during the Battle of Nekmíř in December 1419 and the Battle of Sudoměř in March 1420. In these battles, Žižka employed transport carriages as wagon forts to stop the enemy&#x27;s cavalry charge. The main weight of the fighting rested on militiamen armed with cold weapons, but firearms shooting from behind the safety of the wagon forts proved to be very effective. Following this experience, Žižka ordered mass manufacturing of war wagons according to a universal template as well as manufacturing of new types of firearms that would be more suitable for use in the open battlefield.

Throughout 1420 and most of 1421, the Hussite tactical use of wagon forts and firearms was defensive. The wagon&#x27;s wall was stationary, and firearms were used to break the initial charge of the enemy. After this, firearms played an auxiliary role, supporting mainly cold weapons-based defense at the level of the wagon wall. Counterattacks were done by cold weapons-armed infantry and cavalry charges outside of the wagon forts.

The first mobile use of war wagons and firearms took place during the Hussite breakthrough of Catholic encirclement at in November 1421 at the . The wagons and firearms were used on the move, at this point still only defensively. Žižka avoided the main camp of the enemy and employed the moving wagon forts in order to cover his retreating troops.

The first true engagement where firearms played primary role happened a month later during the Battle of Kutná Hora. Žižka positioned his forces between the town of Kutná Hora, which pledged allegiance to the Hussite cause, and the main camp of the enemy, leaving supplies in the well-defended town. However uprising of ethnic German townsmen led the town into Crusader&#x27;s control.

Late in the night between 21 and 22 December 1421, Žižka ordered an attack against the enemy&#x27;s main camp. The attack was conducted by using a gradually moving wagon wall. Instead of the usual infantry raids beyond the wagons, the attack relied mainly on the use of ranged weapons from the moving wagons. Nighttime use of firearms proved extremely effective, not only practically but also psychologically.

The year 1421 marked not only a shift in the importance of firearms, from auxiliary to primary weapons of Hussite militia, but also the establishment of the Čáslav diet of formal legal duty for all inhabitants to obey the call to arms of the elected provisional government. For the first time in medieval European history, this was not put in place in order to fulfill duties to a feudal lord or to the church, but in order to participate in the defense of the country.

Firearms design underwent fast development during the Hussite Wars, and their civilian possession became a matter of course throughout the war as well as after its end in 1434. The word used for one type of handheld firearm used by the Hussites, , later found its way through German and French into English as the term &quot;pistol&quot;. The name of a cannon used by the Hussites, the , gave rise to the English term, &quot;howitzer&quot; (&quot;houf&quot; meaning &quot;crowd&quot; for its intended use of shooting stone and iron shots against mass enemy forces). Other types of firearms commonly used by the Hussites included , an infantry weapon heavier than píšťala and &quot;tarasnice&quot; (fauconneau). As regards cannons, apart from houfnice, Hussites employed &quot;bombarda&quot; (mortar) and &quot;dělo&quot; (cannon).

== First anti-Hussite crusade ==
After the death of his childless brother Wenceslaus, Sigismund inherited a claim on the Bohemian crown, though it was then, and remained until much later, in question whether Bohemia was a hereditary or an elective monarchy, especially since the line through which Sigismund claimed the throne had accepted that the Kingdom of Bohemia was an elective monarchy elected by the nobles, and thus, the regent of the kingdom (Čeněk of Wartenberg) also explicitly stated that Sigismund had not been elected as a reason for Sigismund&#x27;s claim to not be accepted. A firm adherent of the Church of Rome, Sigismund was aided by Pope Martin V, who issued a bull on 17 March 1420 proclaiming a crusade &quot;for the destruction of the Wycliffites, Hussites and all other heretics in Bohemia&quot;. Sigismund and many German princes arrived before Prague on 30 June at the head of a vast army of crusaders from all parts of Europe, largely consisting of adventurers attracted by the hope of pillage. They immediately began a siege of the city, which had, however, soon to be abandoned. Negotiations took place for a settlement of the religious differences.

The united Hussites formulated their demands in a statement known as the &quot;Four Articles of Prague&quot;. This document, the most important of the Hussite period, ran, in the wording of the contemporary chronicler, Laurence of Brezova, as follows:

These articles, which contain the essence of the Hussite doctrine, were rejected by King Sigismund, mainly through the influence of the papal legates, who considered them prejudicial to the authority of the pope. Hostilities therefore continued. However, Sigismund was defeated at the Battle of Vítkov Hill on July 1420.

Though Sigismund had retired from Prague, his troops held the castles of Vyšehrad and Hradčany. The citizens of Prague laid siege to Vyšehrad (see Battle of Vyšehrad), and towards the end of October 1420 the garrison was on the point of capitulating through famine. Sigismund tried to relieve the fortress but was decisively defeated by the Hussites on 1 November near the village of Pankrác. The castles of Vyšehrad and Hradčany now capitulated, and shortly afterwards, almost all Bohemia fell into the hands of the Hussites.

==Second anti-Hussite crusade==
Internal troubles prevented the followers of Hus from fully capitalizing on their victory. At Prague, a demagogue, the priest Jan Želivský, for a time obtained almost unlimited authority over the lower classes of the townsmen, and at Tábor, a religious communistic movement (that of the so-called Adamites) was sternly suppressed by Žižka. Shortly afterwards, a new crusade against the Hussites was undertaken. A large German army entered Bohemia and in August 1421 laid siege to the town of Žatec. After an unsuccessful attempt of storming the city, the crusaders retreated somewhat ingloriously on hearing that the Hussite troops were approaching. Sigismund only arrived in Bohemia at the end of 1421. He took possession of the town of Kutná Hora but was decisively defeated by Jan Žižka at the Battle of Německý Brod on 6 January 1422.

==Bohemian civil war==

Bohemia was for a time free from foreign intervention, but internal discord again broke out, caused partly by theological strife and partly by the ambition of agitators. On 9 March 1422, Jan Želivský was arrested by the town council of Prague and beheaded. There were troubles at Tábor also, where a more radical party opposed Žižka&#x27;s authority.

==Polish and Lithuanian involvement==
The Hussites were aided at various times by Poland. Because of this, Jan Žižka arranged for the crown of Bohemia to be offered to King Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland, who, under pressure from his own advisors, refused it. The crown was then offered to Władysław&#x27;s cousin, Vytautas, the Grand Duke of Lithuania. Vytautas accepted it, with the condition that the Hussites reunite with the Catholic Church. In 1422, Žižka accepted Prince Sigismund Korybut of Lithuania (nephew of Władysław II) as regent of Bohemia for Vytautas.

His authority was recognized by the Utraquist nobles, the citizens of Prague, and the more moderate of the Taborites, but he failed to bring the Hussites back into the church. On a few occasions, he fought against both the Taborites and the Orebites to try to force them into reuniting. After Władysław II and Vytautas signed the Treaty of Melno with Sigismund of Hungary in 1423, they recalled Sigismund Korybut to Lithuania, under pressure from Sigismund of Hungary and the pope.

On his departure, civil war broke out, the Taborites opposing in arms the more moderate Utraquists, who at this period are also called by the chroniclers the &quot;Praguers&quot;, as Prague was their principal stronghold. On 27 April 1423, Žižka now again leading, the Taborites defeated the Utraquist army under Čeněk of Wartenberg at the Battle of Hořice; shortly afterwards an armistice was concluded at Konopilt.

==Third anti-Hussite crusade==
Papal influence had succeeded in calling forth a new crusade against Bohemia, but it resulted in complete failure. In spite of the endeavours of their rulers, Poles and Lithuanians did not wish to attack the kindred Czechs; the Germans were prevented by internal discord from taking joint action against the Hussites; and King Eric VII of Denmark, who had landed in Germany with a large force intending to take part in the crusade, soon returned to his own country. Free for a time from foreign threat, the Hussites invaded Moravia, where a large part of the population favored their creed, but paralysed again by dissensions, they soon returned to Bohemia.

The city of Hradec Králové, which had been under Utraquist rule, espoused the doctrine of Tábor and called Žižka to its aid. After several military successes gained by Žižka in 1423 and the following year, a treaty of peace between the Hussite factions was concluded on 13 September 1424 at Libeň, a village near Prague (now part of that city).

Sigismund Korybut, who had returned to Bohemia in 1424 with 1,500 troops, helped broker this peace. After Žižka&#x27;s death in October 1424, Prokop the Great took command of the Taborites. Korybut, who had come in defiance of Władysław II and Vytautas, also became a Hussite leader.

==Fourth anti-Hussite crusade==
In 1426, the Hussites were attacked again by foreign enemies. In June 1426, Hussite forces, led by Prokop and Sigismund Korybut, significantly defeated the invaders in the Battle of Aussig.

Despite this result, the death of Jan Žižka caused many, including Pope Martin V, to believe that the Hussites were much weakened. Martin proclaimed yet another crusade in 1427. He appointed Cardinal Henry Beaufort of England as the papal legate of Germany, Hungary, and Bohemia, to lead the crusader forces. The crusaders were defeated at the Battle of Tachov.

The Hussites invaded parts of Germany several times, but they made no attempt to occupy permanently any part of the country.

Korybut was imprisoned in 1427 for allegedly conspiring to surrender the Hussite forces to Sigismund of Hungary. He was released in 1428 and participated in the Hussite invasion of Silesia.

After a few years, Korybut returned to Poland with his men. Korybut and his Poles did not really want to leave, but the pope threatened to call a crusade against Poland if they did not.

==Glorious rides (chevauchée)==

During the Hussite Wars, the Hussites launched raids against many bordering countries. The Hussites called them &quot;Spanilé jízdy&quot; (&quot;glorious rides&quot;). Especially under the leadership of Prokop the Great, Hussites invaded Silesia, Saxony, Hungary, Lusatia, and Meissen. These raids were against countries that had supplied the Germans with men during the anti-Hussite crusades, to deter further participation. However, the raids did not have the desired effect; these countries kept supplying soldiers for the crusades against the Hussites.

During a war between Poland and the Teutonic Order, some Hussite troops helped the Poles. In 1433, a Hussite army of 7,000 men marched through Neumark into Prussia and captured Dirschau on the Vistula River. They eventually reached the mouth of the Vistula where it enters the Baltic Sea near Danzig. There, they performed a great victory celebration to show that nothing but the ocean could stop the Hussites. The Prussian historian Heinrich von Treitschke later wrote that they had &quot;greeted the sea with a wild Czech song about God&#x27;s warriors, and filled their water bottles with brine in token that the Baltic once more obeyed the Slavs.&quot;

==Peace talks==
The almost uninterrupted series of victories of the Hussites now rendered vain all hope of subduing them by force of arms. Moreover, the conspicuously democratic character of the Hussite movement caused the German princes, who were afraid that such ideas might spread to their own countries, to desire peace. Many Hussites, particularly the Utraquist clergy, were also in favour of peace. Negotiations for this purpose were to take place at the ecumenical Council of Basel which had been summoned to meet on 3 March 1431. The Roman See reluctantly consented to the presence of heretics at this council but indignantly rejected the suggestion of the Hussites that members of the Eastern Orthodox Church, and representatives of all Christian creeds, should also be present. Before definitely giving its consent to peace negotiations, the Roman Church determined on making a last effort to reduce the Hussites to subjection; this resulted in the fifth Crusade against the Hussites.

==Fifth anti-Hussite crusade==

On 1 August 1431, a large army of crusaders under Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg, accompanied by Cardinal Cesarini as papal legate, crossed the Bohemian border. On 8 August the crusaders reached the town of Domažlice and began besieging it. On 14 August, a Hussite relief army arrived, reinforced with some 6,000 Polish Hussites and under the command of Prokop the Great, and it completely routed the crusaders at the resulting Battle of Domažlice. According to legend, upon seeing the Hussite banners and hearing their battle hymn &quot;Ktož jsú boží bojovníci&quot; (&quot;Ye Who are Warriors of God&quot;), the invading papal forces immediately took to flight.

==New negotiations and the defeat of radical Hussites==
On 15 October 1431, the Council of Basel issued a formal invitation to the Hussites to take part in its deliberations. Prolonged negotiations ensued, but a Hussite embassy, led by Prokop and including John of Rokycan, the Taborite bishop Mikuláš of Pelhřimov, the &quot;English Hussite&quot; Peter Payne, and many others, arrived at Basel on 4 January 1433. No agreement could be reached, but negotiations were not broken off, and a change in the political situation of Bohemia finally resulted in a settlement.

In 1434, war again broke out between the Utraquists and the Taborites. On 30 May 1434, the Taborite army, led by Prokop the Great and Prokop the Lesser, who both fell in the battle, was totally defeated and almost annihilated at the Battle of Lipany.

The Polish Hussite movement also came to an end. Polish royal troops under Władysław III of Varna defeated the Hussites at the Battle of Grotniki in 1439, bringing the Hussite Wars to an end.

==Peace agreement==
The moderate party thus obtained the upper hand and wanted to find a compromise between the council and the Hussites. It formulated its demands in a document which was accepted by the Church of Rome in a slightly modified form, and which is known as &quot;the compacts&quot;. The compacts, mainly founded on the articles of Prague, declare that:

# The Holy Sacrament is to be given freely in both kinds to all Christians in Bohemia and Moravia, and to those elsewhere who adhere to the faith of these two countries.
# All mortal sins shall be punished and extirpated by those whose office it is so to do.
# The word of God is to be freely and truthfully preached by the priests of the Lord, and by worthy deacons.
# The priests in the time of the law of grace shall claim no ownership of worldly possessions.

On 5 July 1436, the compacts were formally accepted and signed at Jihlava (Iglau), in Moravia, by King Sigismund, the Hussite delegates, and the representatives of the Roman Catholic Church. The latter, however, refused to recognize John of Rokycan as archbishop of Prague, who had been elected to that dignity by the estates of Bohemia.

==Aftermath==

At the end of the Hussite Wars in 1431, the lands of Bohemia had been totally ravaged. According to some estimates, the population of the Czech lands, estimated at 2.80–3.37 million around 1400, fell to 1.50–1.85 million by 1526. The adjacent Bishopric of Würzburg in Germany was left in such bad shape after the Hussite Wars that the impoverishment of the people was still evident in 1476. The poor conditions contributed directly to the peasant conspiracy that broke out that same year in Würzburg.

In 1466, Pope Paul II excommunicated the Hussite king George of Poděbrady and forbade all Catholics from continuing to serve him. In 1468, the Kingdom of Bohemia was invaded by the king of Hungary, Matthias Corvinus. Matthias invaded with the pretext of returning Bohemia to Catholicism. The Czech Catholic Estates elected Matthias King of Bohemia. Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia soon accepted his rule but Bohemia proper remained faithful to George of Poděbrady. The religious peace of Kutná Hora of 1485 finished a long series of religious conflicts in the Czech lands and constituted a definitive end to the Hussite Wars.
The Utraquist creed, frequently varying in its details, continued to be that of the established church of Bohemia until all non-Catholic religious services were prohibited shortly after the Battle of the White Mountain in 1620. The Taborite party never recovered from its defeat at Lipany, and after the town of Tábor had been captured by George of Poděbrady in 1452, Utraquist religious worship was established there. The Moravian Brethren (&quot;Unitas Fratrum&quot;) - whose intellectual originator was Petr Chelčický but whose actual founders were Brother Gregory, a nephew of Archbishop Rokycany, and Michael, curate of Žamberk – to a certain extent continued the Taborite traditions, and in the 15th and 16th centuries included most of the strongest opponents of Rome in Bohemia.

John Amos Comenius, a member of the Brethren, claimed for the members of his church that they were the genuine inheritors of the doctrines of Hus. After the beginning of the German Reformation, many Utraquists adopted to a large extent the doctrines of Martin Luther and of John Calvin and, in 1567, obtained the repeal of the Compacts which no longer seemed sufficiently far-reaching. From the end of the 16th century, the inheritors of the Hussite tradition in Bohemia were included in the more general name of &quot;Protestants&quot; borne by the adherents of the Reformation.

== In popular culture ==
Andrzej Sapkowski&#x27;s Hussite Trilogy is set in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (mostly Silesia and Bohemia) during the Hussite Wars.

&quot;&quot; (2013), a manga series by , focuses on a girl named Šárka who joins the Hussite Wars after the deaths of her family.

<doc id="303018" wikidata="Q3453949" url="?curid=303018" title="Ryne Sandberg">
<text>Ryne Dee Sandberg (born September 18, 1959), nicknamed &quot;Ryno&quot;, is an American former professional baseball player, coach, and manager. He played sixteen seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a second baseman for the Philadelphia Phillies (1981) and the Chicago Cubs (1982–1994, 1996–1997).

After a slow start to his career, Sandberg made a name for himself on June 23, 1984, having a career game including two home runs in what would colloquially become known as the “Sandberg Game”. Following this, Sandberg established himself as a perennial All-Star and Gold Glove candidate, making ten consecutive All-Star appearances and winning nine consecutive Gold Gloves from to . His career .989 fielding percentage was a major-league record at second base when he retired in 1997. He is tied with Jose Altuve for the most Silver Slugger Awards for a second baseman with seven. In 2005, Sandberg was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. He resigned from his managerial duties for the Phillies on June 26, 2015, and was succeeded by Pete Mackanin.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Spokane, Washington, Sandberg&#x27;s parents were Elizabeth, a nurse, and Derwent D. &quot;Sandy&quot; Sandberg, a mortician. He was named for relief pitcher Ryne Duren.

Sandberg was a three-sport star in high school at North Central and graduated in 1978. The previous fall he was named to &quot;Parade Magazine&quot;&#x27;s High School All-America football team, one of the eight quarterbacks, and one of two players from the state of Washington. The school&#x27;s baseball field was named in his honor in 1985 as &quot;Ryne Sandberg Field&quot;, and his varsity number was retired in both football and baseball.

Sandberg was recruited to play quarterback at NCAA Division I colleges, and eventually signed a letter of intent with Washington State University in Pullman. He opted not to attend after being selected in the 20th round of the 1978 baseball amateur draft by the Philadelphia Phillies.

==Minor leagues==
Sandberg was reportedly drafted after Bill Harper and Wilbur &quot;Moose&quot; Johnson, both Philadelphia Phillies scouts, persuaded Phillies director of scouting Dallas Green to draft Sandberg, despite his college football commitment. After the Phillies drafted Sandberg, Harper reportedly met with Sandberg, his parents, and brother Del at the Sandberg home. &quot;His parents, particularly his mother, were very concerned about Ryne going to college and getting an education,&quot; Harper recalled. Sandberg reportedly received a $20,000 bonus, accepting the offer after taking a walk with his brother during the meeting.

In 1978, at age 18, Sandberg began his professional career after being drafted by the Phillies. Sandberg played for the Helena Phillies in the Rookie level Pioneer League. In his first professional season, Sandberg played exclusively at shortstop and hit .311 with a .390 OBP, 1 home run, 15 stolen bases and 23 RBI in 56 games. Among his teammates at Helena were George Bell, a future MVP, and Bob Dernier, who would later form the &quot;Daily Double&quot; with Sandberg in Chicago. The three would advance through the Phillies system as teammates.

Remaining at shortstop in 1979, Sandberg played for the Class A level Spartanburg Phillies in the Western Carolinas League. In 138 games, Sandberg hit .247 with 7 triples, 4 home runs, 21 stolen bases and 47 RBI.

Sandberg played for the Class AA level Reading Phillies of the Eastern League in 1980. With Reading, Sandberg hit .310, with a .403 OBP, 12 triples, 32 stolen bases, 11 home runs and 79 RBI. Playing in 129 games for Reading, Sandberg drew 73 bases on balls against 72 strikeouts. In the field, Sandberg played 120 games at shortstop and 4 at third base. Sandberg was selected to the Eastern League All-Star team

Advancing to the Class AAA level Oklahoma City 89ers in 1981, Sandberg played 133 games before being called up by the Philadelphia Phillies. With Oklahoma City, Sandberg remained primarily at shortstop while playing 17 games at second base. Sandberg hit .293, with a .352 OBP, 32 stolen bases, 9 home runs and 62 RBI.

==Philadelphia Phillies==
Sandberg made his major-league debut as a shortstop for the Phillies in . Playing in 13 games, Sandberg had one hit in six at-bats for a .167 batting average during his brief stint with the team. The one hit occurred at Wrigley Field using a bat borrowed from starting shortstop Larry Bowa.

The Phillies soon concluded that Sandberg was not a successor to Bowa at shortstop. While Sandberg had played both second and third base in the minor leagues, he was blocked from those positions by Manny Trillo and Mike Schmidt. He was traded along with Bowa to the Cubs for shortstop Iván DeJesús prior to the season. The trade, now reckoned as one of the most lopsided deals in baseball history, came about after negotiations for a new contract between Bowa and the Phillies broke down.

Cubs general manager Dallas Green wanted a young prospect to go along with the aging Bowa (as it turned out, Bowa&#x27;s playing career ended after the 1985 season). Green had been instrumental in the drafting of Sandberg in 1978, while working in the Phillies front office. The two remained close over the years. Years later, Phillies general manager Paul Owens said that he hadn&#x27;t wanted to trade Sandberg, but Green and the Cubs weren&#x27;t interested in any of the other prospects he offered. Owens then went back to his scouts, who said Sandberg wouldn&#x27;t be any more than a utility infielder. However, Sandberg had hit over .290 in the minors two years in a row. The trade is now considered one of the best (if not &quot;the&quot; best) in recent Cubs history. At the same time, it is considered one of the worst trades in Phillies history. While DeJesus helped anchor the Phillies infield on their way to the 1983 World Series, he lasted only three years in Philadelphia, and was out of baseball by 1988.

Sandberg is one of two Hall of Famers who came up through the Phillies farm system and earned their Hall of Fame credentials primarily as Cubs, the other being Ferguson Jenkins. Similarly, Jenkins, then age 23, was traded to the Cubs in another trade that ended up heavily favoring the Cubs, a multi-player trade for 1960s workhorse pitcher Larry Jackson, then age 35, and Bob Buhl, then age 37, whose best days were behind him.

==Chicago Cubs==
The Cubs, who initially wanted Sandberg to play center field, installed him as their third baseman, and he went on to be one of the top-rated rookies of 1982. After the Cubs acquired veteran Ron Cey following the 1982 season, they moved Sandberg to second base, where he became a star.

===1984===
After winning a Gold Glove Award in his first season at the new position, Sandberg emerged with a breakout season in , in which he batted .314 with 200 hits, 114 runs, 36 doubles, 19 triples, 19 homers, and 84 RBIs. Bob Dernier was the leadoff hitter and gold glove center fielder for the Cubs in 1984, while Sandberg batted second. The pair was dubbed &quot;The Daily Double&quot; by Cubs announcer Harry Caray. In 1984 Sandberg&#x27;s runs and triples totals led the National League. He nearly became only the third player to collect 20 doubles, triples, home runs, and stolen bases in the same season, led the Cubs to the National League&#x27;s Eastern Division title (their first championship of &quot;any&quot; kind since 1945), and won the National League Most Valuable Player Award, the first by a Cub since Ernie Banks&#x27; back-to-back honors in and .

After his great season in which he garnered national attention, he wrote an autobiography &quot;Ryno&quot; with Fred Mitchell.

====&quot;The Sandberg Game&quot;====

One game in particular was cited for putting Sandberg (as well as the 1984 Cubs in general) &quot;on the map&quot;, an NBC national telecast of a Cardinals–Cubs game on June 23, . The Cubs had been playing well throughout the season&#x27;s first few months, but as a team unaccustomed to winning, they had not yet become a serious contender in the eyes of most baseball fans.

As for Sandberg, he had played two full seasons in the major leagues, and while he had shown himself to be a top-fielding second baseman and fast on the basepaths (over 30 stolen bases both seasons), his .260-ish batting average and single-digit home run production were respectable for his position but not especially noteworthy, and Sandberg was not talked about outside Chicago. The &quot;Game of the Week&quot;, however, put the sleeper Cubs on the national stage against their regional rival, the St. Louis Cardinals. Both teams were well-established franchises with strong fan bases outside the Chicago and St. Louis areas.

In the ninth inning, the Cubs trailed 9–8, and faced the premier relief pitcher of the time, Bruce Sutter. Sutter was at the forefront of the emergence of the closer in the late 1970s and early 1980s and was especially dominant in 1984, saving 45 games. However, in the ninth inning, Sandberg, not yet known for his power, slugged a solo home run to left field against the Cardinals&#x27; ace closer, tying the game. Answering this dramatic act, the Cardinals scored two runs in the top of the tenth. Sandberg came up again in the tenth inning, facing a determined Sutter with a man on base. As Cubs&#x27; radio announcer Harry Caray described it: 

The Cubs went on to win in the 11th inning, with the winning run being driven in by a single off the bat of Dave Owen. The Cardinals&#x27; Willie McGee, who hit for the cycle during the game, had already been named NBC&#x27;s Player of the Game before Sandberg&#x27;s first home run; Sandberg later shared that distinction with McGee. As NBC play-by-play announcer Bob Costas, who called the game with Tony Kubek, said when Sandberg hit the second home run, &quot;Do you believe it?!&quot; The game is known as &quot;The Sandberg Game&quot;.

===1985===
In , Sandberg batted .305 with 26 home runs, 83 RBIs, 113 runs scored and a career-high 54 stolen bases, joining the 20–50 club with his combination of power and speed.

===1990===
In , Sandberg led the National League in home runs–a rarity for a second baseman–with 40. Sandberg was only the third second baseman to hit 40 home runs; Rogers Hornsby and Davey Johnson hit 42, and no American League second baseman had reached forty until Brian Dozier in 2016. Sandberg also batted in 100 runs, despite batting second in the order. His batting average did not suffer from his new level of power, as he finished at .306 for the season. Sandberg, Brady Anderson, Barry Bonds, and Ronald Acuña, Jr. are the only players to have both a 40-homer (1990) and 50-steal () season during their careers.

Sandberg played a then major league-record 123 straight games at second base without an error. This record was later broken in 2007 by Plácido Polanco, then of the Detroit Tigers. Sandberg played in front of his hometown fans in the 1990 MLB All-Star Game which was held in Wrigley Field, home of the Cubs. Sandberg won the Home Run Derby with three home runs over the left-field bleachers. Not until the Cincinnati Reds&#x27; Todd Frazier in did another player win the Home Run Derby in their home stadium.

===1991===
In , Sandberg batted .291 with 26 home runs and batted in 100 runs for the second consecutive season. He also won his ninth consecutive Gold Glove at second base, breaking a tie he had shared with Bill Mazeroski for most Gold Gloves at that position (Roberto Alomar has since broken this record).

===1992===
On March 2, , Sandberg became the highest paid player in baseball at the time, signing a $28.4 million ($ today) four-year extension worth $7.1 million ($ today) a season. He earned a spot on the NL All-Star roster and an NL Silver Slugger Award at second base with a .304 batting average, 26 home runs, 100 runs, and 87 runs batted in.

===1994===
Sandberg, a notoriously slow early season starter, found himself struggling even more so than usual early in the 1994 season. With his average at a career low .238 and having recorded only 53 hits in 57 games, Sandberg decided to step away from baseball, and on June 13, 1994, he announced his retirement. In his book, &quot;Second to Home&quot;, Sandberg said, 

===1996–1997===

Sandberg returned to the Chicago Cubs for the and seasons, then retired with a career batting average of .285, and a record 277 home runs as a second baseman; this record was surpassed in by Jeff Kent. Sandberg&#x27;s final game at Wrigley Field and final career hit were on September 21, 1997. This also was the final Wrigley Field game for Cubs broadcaster Harry Caray, who died during the following winter.

==Post-playing career==
Initially, Sandberg kept a low profile after retiring. However, in , Sandberg accepted his first marketing deal since his retirement, agreeing to be spokesman for National City Bank. He also appeared on ESPN Radio 1000 as an analyst during the baseball season. He is also a former baseball columnist for Yahoo! Sports.

===Hall of Fame induction===
Sandberg delivered what many traditionalist fans considered a stirring speech at his Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2005. He thanked the writers who voted for him because it meant that he played the game the way he had been taught it should be played. He spoke several times of respect for the game, and chided a subset of current players who, in his opinion, lack that respect. Specifically, he spoke of how the game needs more than home run hitters, citing that turning a double-play and laying down a sacrifice bunt are weapons many of today&#x27;s greats don&#x27;t value. He also made a strong pitch for induction of his former teammate, Andre Dawson, who was ultimately elected to join the Hall in 2010, and famously promoted the election of a long-snubbed former Cub to the Hall by saying, &quot;For what it&#x27;s worth, Ron Santo just earned one more vote on the Veterans Committee.&quot;

===Number retirement===

Following his Hall of Fame induction, Sandberg had his number 23 retired in a ceremony at Wrigley Field on August 28, . He became only the fourth Chicago Cub to have his number retired, following (in chronological order) Ernie Banks (#14), Billy Williams (#26), and Ron Santo (#10). Sandberg has worn his uniform number 23 in past jobs as a Cubs spring training instructor and Peoria Chiefs manager. He also wore that number during his time with the Iowa Cubs as their manager and as the manager of the Lehigh Valley IronPigs.

===Managerial career===
Sandberg formerly served as a spring training instructor for the Cubs in Mesa, Arizona.

====2007–2010====

On December 5, 2006, Sandberg was named manager of the Cubs&#x27; Class-A Peoria Chiefs in the Midwest League. In his first season as a manager, he took his team to the Midwest League championship game. In December 2008, Sandberg was promoted to manager of the Class Double-A Team Tennessee Smokies in the Southern League. In December 2009, he was again promoted, to manager of the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. Upon leading Iowa to an 82–62 record, the Pacific Coast League named him its 2010 Manager of the Year.

Sandberg has said that his ideal job was to manage the Chicago Cubs. Former manager Lou Piniella suggested that Sandberg, as manager of the Cubs&#x27; top minor-league affiliate, would be in the mix to replace him when he retired after the 2010 season.
However, the position was given to interim manager Mike Quade.

====2011–2015====
On November 15, 2010, Sandberg left the Cubs organization and returned to his original organization as manager of the Phillies&#x27; top minor-league affiliate, the Lehigh Valley IronPigs. He led the IronPigs to their first-ever playoff appearance and the International League championship series. &quot;Baseball America&quot; named him its 2011 Minor League Manager of the Year.

After the 2012 season, Sandberg was promoted to third base coach and infield instructor of the Philadelphia Phillies. He was promoted to interim manager of the Phillies after they fired Charlie Manuel on August 16, 2013. Sandberg earned his first win as a manager against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday August 18, 2013.

=====Phillies manager=====
On September 22, 2013, Sandberg was named permanent manager, with a three-year contract, with an option for 2017. He became the first Hall-of-Fame player to manage a team full-time since Frank Robinson managed the Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals from 2002 to 2006.
On April 26, 2015, Sandberg earned his 100th win as a major league manager on a 5–4 win against the Atlanta Braves. Two months later, on June 26, 2015, Sandberg resigned from the position of Phillies manager with his team in last place in the National League East Division at a record of 26–48, the worst record in Major League Baseball.

===Cubs ambassador===
In 2016, Sandberg joined the Cubs organization as a goodwill ambassador. In this position, he makes public appearances at Cubs-related events, and attends Cubs games to meet and greet fans; and is an occasional color commentator for the team&#x27;s telecasts on Marquee Sports Network.

==Managerial record==


==Personal life==
Sandberg married his high school sweetheart, Cindy, and the couple had two children, Justin and Lindsey. They divorced in July 1995. Sandberg married Margaret in August 1995. She has three children from her former marriage, BR, Adriane and Steven. He also has eight grandchildren. Ryne&#x27;s nephew, Jared Sandberg, was a third baseman for the Tampa Bay Rays from 2001 to 2003.

In January 2024, Sandberg announced that he had begun treatment for metastatic prostate cancer.

===Charity foundations===
Sandberg and his wife, Margaret, founded Ryno Kid Care to assist in the lives of children with serious illnesses. The organization provided anything from &quot;big brothers&quot; (mentors and older companions) to a home-cooked meal. Ryno Kid Care also provided massage therapists and clowns dressed up as doctors and nurses to brighten the children&#x27;s day.

Ryno Kid Care&#x27;s mission was &quot;dedicated to enhancing the lives of children with serious medical conditions and their families, by providing supportive, compassionate and meaningful programming.&quot; Ryno Kid Care is no longer in operation.

=== Awards ===
Sandberg was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 2017.

Sandberg was dedicated a statue, the Statue of Ryne Sandberg in 2024. The bronze sculpture is located at Gallagher Way, a park outside of Wrigley Field. The statue outlines his baseball achievements and includes the text of his Hall of Fame plaque.

<doc id="303021" wikidata="Q7229419" url="?curid=303021" title="Poplar Rates Rebellion">
<text>The Poplar Rates Rebellion, or Poplar Rates Revolt, was a tax protest that took place in Poplar, London, England, in 1921. It was led by George Lansbury, the previous year&#x27;s Labour Mayor of Poplar, with the support of the Poplar Borough Council, most of whom were industrial workers. The protest defied government, the courts, and the Labour Party leadership. George Lansbury would later go on to be the leader of the Labour Party.

==Background==
Despite being a suburb on the edge of London, Poplar was one of the poorest boroughs; and there was no government support to alleviate the high unemployment, hunger, and poverty in the borough, and the work of Poplar Poor Law Union had to be funded by the borough itself under the poor law.

Poplar Borough Council&#x27;s Labour administration elected in 1919 undertook a comprehensive programme of social reform and poor relief, including equal pay for women and a minimum wage for council workers, far in excess of the market rate. This programme was expensive and had to be funded from the rates.

Because Poplar was a poor borough, property rents were low. With liability for local taxation assessed on the basis of a &#x27;rateable value&#x27; deriving from rents, Poplar Borough Council had to set a much higher rate in order to produce the same amount as produced by low rates in a wealthy borough. In addition to the precept for Poplar Poor Law Union, Poplar ratepayers were also charged precepts to pay for the London County Council, Metropolitan Police, Metropolitan Asylums Board and the Metropolitan Water Board.

There was a small fund which attempted to correct for the different rate products but Poplar called for complete equalisation of the rates so that the same rate brought in the same income both to Poplar and to a wealthier West London borough.

==History==
In 1921, faced with the prospect of a further large increase in the rates, Poplar Borough Council decided to hold them down by not collecting the precepts which it should have passed on to the four cross-London authorities. The London County Council and Metropolitan Asylums Board responded by taking the matter to the High Court. The council&#x27;s response was to organise a procession of 2,000 supporters from Bow on 28 July 1921, led by the borough&#x27;s official mace-bearer, to the accompaniment of a band and a banner proclaiming, &quot;Poplar Borough Council marching to the High Court and possibly to prison&quot;.

Thirty councillors, including six women, one of whom, Nellie Cressall, was pregnant, were sent to prison indefinitely for contempt of court for refusing a court order to remit the monies. The men were put up in Brixton Prison, and the women in Holloway (where they were much better treated than the men). Susan Lawrence used the time to read Tolstoy and prepare a pamphlet on taxation. Another of the jailed women was Lansbury&#x27;s own daughter-in-law Minnie Lansbury, who due to her imprisonment, developed pneumonia and died at the age of 32.

The councillors were:
* David Morgan Adams
* Albert Baker
* Joseph Henry Banks
* George Cressall
* Nellie Cressall
* Albert Victor Farr
* Benjamin Fleming
* Thomas John Goodway
* Walter Henry Green
* James Joseph Heales

==Outcome==
The revolt received wide public support. Lansbury addressed crowds that regularly gathered outside, through the prison bars. Neighbouring councils threatened to take similar action. Trade unions passed resolutions of support and collected funds for the councillors&#x27; families. Eventually, after six weeks&#x27; imprisonment, the court ordered the councillors released, which occasioned great celebrations in Poplar.

Meanwhile, a bill, the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act 1921, was rushed through Parliament between 8 November and 10 November 1921. It more or less equalised tax burdens between rich and poor boroughs. The new Act also introduced a power, in clause 2, permitting a precepting authority to apply to the courts for the appointment of a receiver to take the funds directly from a council that withheld them.

In 1925, the district auditor surcharged the councillors for Poplar Borough Council&#x27;s policies of more generous pay for council workers, and equal pay for women workers. The surcharge was challenged by judicial review in the courts and, eventually, in &quot;Roberts v Hopwood&quot; the House of Lords ruled that the increased pay was unlawful, and upheld the surcharge.

Despite the equalisation of rates, the dispute regarding the monies paid for outdoor relief would continue for some years until the abolition of the poor law unions. Under the Local Government Act 1929, the responsibility for the provision of outdoor relief transferred from the Poplar Poor Law Union to the London County Council, and thereby the financial burden was spread across the entire County of London.

Lansbury was hailed as a hero; in the 1922 general election he won the parliamentary seat of Bow and Bromley with a majority of nearly 7,000, and would hold it for the rest of his life, including his period as Leader of the Labour Party. The term &quot;Poplarism&quot;, always identified closely with Lansbury, became a political term associated with large-scale municipal relief for the poor and needy, and also came to be applied generally to campaigns where local government stood against central government on behalf of the poor and least privileged of society.

==The Hale Street Mural==
In 1990, local artist Mark Francis painted a mural on the wall of the Tower Hamlets Parks Department depot on Hale Street, E14.

The mural commemorates the Poplar Rates Rebellion over four panels, including an image of George Lansbury wearing his mayoral chain of office; placards reading &quot;Can&#x27;t Pay Won&#x27;t Pay&quot;&#x27;, and a list of the names of the imprisoned councillors. The fourth panel draws a parallel with the contemporary campaign against the 1990s-era poll tax.

The mural was restored in 2007 by David Bratby and Maureen Delenian.

<doc id="303023" wikidata="Q24766" url="?curid=303023" title="Mandeville's Travels">
<text>The Travels of Sir John Mandeville, commonly known as Mandeville&#x27;s Travels, is a book written between 1357 and 1371 that purports to be the travelogue of an Englishman named Sir John Mandeville across the Near East as far as India and China. The earliest-surviving text is in French, followed by translations into many other languages; the work acquired extraordinary popularity. Despite the extremely unreliable and often fantastical nature of the travels it describes, it was used as a work of reference: Christopher Columbus, for example, was heavily influenced by both this work and Marco Polo&#x27;s earlier &quot;Travels&quot;.

According to the book, John de Mandeville crossed the sea in 1332. He traversed by way of Turkey (Asia Minor and Cilicia), Tartary, Persia, Armenia, the Holy Land, Syria, Arabia, Egypt, Libya, Abyssinia, Chaldea, the land of the Amazons, India, China and many countries in the region. He had often been to Jerusalem, and had written in Romance languages as they were generally more widely understood than Latin.

It is fairly clear that &quot;Sir John Mandeville&quot; was an invented author, and various suggestions have been put forward as to the real one. Most of these are figures from France or the Low Countries who had not travelled as widely as the author; none have achieved general acceptance. The book very largely depends on other travel books, sometimes embroidered with legendary or fantastical elements. &quot;Mandeville&#x27;s Travels&quot; may contain facts and knowledge acquired by actual travels and residents in the East, at least in the sections focused on the Holy Land, Egypt, the Levant and the means of getting there. The prologue points almost exclusively to the Holy Land as the subject of the work. The mention of more distant regions comes in only towards the end of this prologue and (in a manner) as an afterthought. However, this is commensurate with Mandeville&#x27;s emphasis on &#x27;curiositas&#x27;—wandering—rather than Christian &#x27;scientia&#x27; (knowledge).

== Sources evidently used ==

The sources of the book have been laboriously investigated by Albert Bovenschen and George F. Warner.

===Odoric of Pordenone===
The greater part of these more distant travels, extending from Trebizond to Hormuz, India, the Malay Archipelago and China, and back to western Asia, has been appropriated from the narrative of Friar Odoric (1330). These passages are almost always swollen with interpolated particulars, usually of an extravagant kind. However, in a number of cases the writer has failed to understand those passages which he adopts from Odoric and professes to give as his own experiences. Thus, where Odoric has given a most curious and veracious account of the Chinese custom of employing tame cormorants to catch fish, the cormorants are converted by Mandeville into &quot;little beasts called loyres which are taught to go into the water&quot; (the word &quot;loyre&quot; being apparently used here for &quot;otter&quot;, &quot;lutra&quot;, for which the Provençal is &quot;luria&quot; or &quot;loiria&quot;).

At a very early date the coincidence of Mandeville&#x27;s stories with those of Odoric was recognized, insomuch that a manuscript of Odoric which is or was in the chapter library at Mainz begins with the words: &quot;Incipit Itinerarius fidelis fratris Odorici socii Militis Mendavil per Indian; licet hic ille prius et alter posterius peregrinationem suam descripsit&quot;. (&quot;Here begins the journey of the faithful Brother Odoric, the companion of the knight Mendavil through India; although here he described his journey first and the other afterwards.&quot;) At a later day Sir Thomas Herbert calls Odoric &quot;travelling companion of our Sir John&quot; Mandeville and anticipates criticism, in at least one passage, by suggesting the probability of his having travelled with Odoric.

===Hetoum===
Much of Mandeville&#x27;s matter, particularly in Asiatic geography and history, is taken from the &quot;La Flor des Estoires d&#x27;Orient&quot; of Hetoum, an Armenian of princely family, who became a monk of the Praemonstrant or Premonstratensian order, and in 1307 dictated this work on the East, in the French tongue at Poitiers, out of his own extraordinary acquaintance with Asia and its history in his own time. A story of the fortress at Corycus, or the Castle Sparrowhawk, appears in Mandeville&#x27;s Book.

===Marco Polo===
No passage in Mandeville can be plausibly traced to Marco Polo, with one exception. This is where he states that at Hormuz the people during the great heat lie in water—a circumstance mentioned by Polo, though not by Odoric. It is most likely that this fact had been interpolated in the copy of Odoric used by Mandeville, for if he had borrowed it directly from Polo he could have borrowed more.

===Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and Vincent de Beauvais===
A good deal about the manners and customs of the Tatars is demonstrably derived from the work of the Franciscan Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, who went as the pope&#x27;s ambassador to the Tatars in 1245–1247; but Dr. Warner considers that the immediate source for Mandeville was the &quot;Speculum historiale&quot; of Vincent de Beauvais. Though the passages in question are all to be found in Carpine more or less exactly, the expression is condensed and the order changed. For examples compare Mandeville, p. 250, on the tasks done by Tatar women, with Carpine, p. 643; Mandeville. p. 250, on Tatar habits of eating, with Carpine, pp. 639–640; Mandeville, p. 231, on the titles borne on the seals of the Great Khan, with Carpine, p. 715, etc.

The account of Prester John is taken from the famous &quot;Epistle&quot; of that imaginary, which was widely diffused in the 13th century. Many fabulous stories, again, of monsters, such as Cyclopes, sciapodes, hippopodes, anthropophagi, monoscelides, and men whose heads did grow beneath their shoulders; of the phoenix and the weeping crocodile, such as Pliny has collected, are introduced here and there, derived no doubt from him, Solinus, the bestiaries, or the &quot;Speculum naturale&quot; of Vincent de Beauvais. And interspersed, especially in the chapters about the Levant, are the stories and legends that were retailed to every pilgrim, such as the legend of Seth and the grains of paradise from which grew the wood of the cross, that of the shooting of old Cain by Lamech, that of the castle of the sparrow-hawk (which appears in the tale of Melusine), those of the origin of the balsam plants at Masariya, of the dragon of Cos, of the river Sambation, etc.

== Authorship ==
In the preface, the compiler calls himself a knight, and states that he was born and bred in England, in the town of St Albans. Although the book is real, it is widely believed that &quot;Sir John Mandeville&quot; himself was not. Common theories point to a Frenchman by the name of Jehan à la Barbe. Other possibilities are discussed below.

Some more recent scholars have suggested that &quot;Mandeville&#x27;s Travels&quot; was most likely written by , a Fleming who wrote in Latin under the name Johannes Longus. Jan de Langhe was born in Ypres early in the 1300s and by 1334 had become a Benedictine monk at the abbey of Saint-Bertin in Saint-Omer, which was about 20 miles from Calais. After studying law at the University of Paris, Langhe returned to the abbey and was elected abbot in 1365. He was a prolific writer and avid collector of travelogues, right up to his death in 1383.

=== Contemporary corroboration===
At least part of &quot;Mandeville&#x27;s Travels&quot; and the life of John Mandeville is mere invention. No contemporary corroboration of the existence of such a &quot;Jehan de Mandeville&quot; is known. Some French manuscripts, not contemporary, give a Latin letter of presentation from him to Edward III of England, but so vague that it might have been penned by any writer on any subject.

Compilation is thought, in large part, to have come from a Liège physician known as Johains à le Barbe or Jehan à la Barbe, otherwise Jehan de Bourgogne. Evidence for this comes from a modernized extract quoted by the Liège herald, Louis Abry (1643–1720), from the lost fourth book of the &quot;Myreur des Hystors&quot; of Johans des Preis, styled d&#x27;Oultremouse. In this, &quot;Jean de Bourgogne, dit a la Barbe&quot; is said to have revealed himself on his deathbed to d&#x27;Oultremouse, whom he made his executor, and to have described himself in his will as &quot;messire Jean de Mandeville, chevalier, comte de Montfort en Angleterre et seigneur de l&#x27;isle de Campdi et du château Pérouse (Lord Jean de Mandeville, knight, Count de Montfort in England and lord of the Isle of Campdi and the castle Pérouse)&quot;.

It is added that, having had the misfortune to kill an unnamed count in his own country, he engaged himself to travel through the three parts of the world, arrived at Liège in 1343, was a great naturalist, profound philosopher and astrologer, and had a remarkable knowledge of physics. The identification is confirmed by the fact that in the now destroyed church of the Guillemins was a tombstone of Mandeville, with a Latin inscription stating that he was otherwise named &quot;ad Barbam&quot;, was a professor of medicine, and died at Liège on 17 November 1372: this inscription is quoted as far back as 1462.

Even before his death, the Liège physician seems to have confessed to a share in the circulation of, and additions to, the work. In the common Latin abridged version of it, at the end of c. vii., the author says that when stopping in the sultan&#x27;s court at Cairo he met a venerable and expert physician of &quot;our&quot; parts, but that they rarely came into conversation because their duties were of a different kind, but that long afterwards at Liège he composed this treatise at the exhortation and with the help (&quot;Jiortatu et adiutorio&quot;) of the same venerable man, as he will narrate at the end of it.

And in the last chapter, he says that in 1355, on returning home, he came to Liège, and being laid up with old age and arthritic gout in the street called Bassesavenyr, i.e. Basse-Sauvenière, consulted the physicians. That one came in who was more venerable than the others by reason of his age and white hairs, was evidently expert in his art, and was commonly called Magister Iohannes ad Barbam. That a chance remark of the latter caused the renewal of their old Cairo acquaintance, and that Ad Barbam, after showing his medical skill on Mandeville, urgently begged him to write his travels; &quot;and so at length, by his advice and help, &quot;monitu et adiutorio&quot;, was composed this treatise, of which I had certainly proposed to write nothing until at least I had reached my own parts in England&quot;. He goes on to speak of himself as being now lodged in Liège, &quot;which is only two days distant from the sea of England&quot;; and it is stated in the colophon (and in the manuscripts) that the book was first published in French by Mandeville, its author, in 1355, at Liège, and soon after in the same city translated into &quot;said&quot; Latin form. Moreover, a manuscript of the French text extant at Liège about 1860 contained a similar statement, and added that the author lodged at a hostel called &quot;al hoste Henkin Levo&quot;: this manuscript gave the physician&#x27;s name as &quot;Johains de Bourgogne dit ale barbe&quot;, which doubtless conveys its local form.

=== Contemporary mentions ===
There is no contemporary English mention of any English knight named Jehan de Mandeville, nor are the arms said to have been on the Liège tomb like any known Mandeville arms. However, George F. Warner has suggested that de Bourgogne may be a certain Johan de Bourgoyne, who was pardoned by parliament on 20 August 1321 for having taken part in the attack on the Despensers (Hugh the Younger and Hugh the Elder), but whose pardon was revoked in May 1322, the year in which &quot;Mandeville&quot; professes to have left England. Among the persons similarly pardoned on the recommendation of the same nobleman was a Johan Mangevilayn, whose name appears related to that of &quot;de Mandeville&quot;, which is a later form of &quot;de Magneville&quot;.

The name Mangevilain occurs in Yorkshire as early as the 16th year of the reign of Henry I of England, but is very rare, and (failing evidence of any place named Mangeville) seems to be merely a variant spelling of Magnevillain. The meaning may be simply &quot;of Magneville&quot;, de Magneville; but the family of a 14th-century bishop of Nevers were called both &quot;Mandevilain&quot; and &quot;de Mandevilain&quot;, where Mandevilain seems a derivative place-name, meaning the Magneville or Mandeville district. The name &quot;de Mandeville&quot; might be suggested to de Bourgogne by that of his fellow culprit Mangevilayn, and it is even possible that the two fled to England together, were in Egypt together, met again at Liège, and shared in the compilation of the &quot;Travels&quot;.

Whether after the appearance of the &quot;Travels&quot; either de Bourgogne or &quot;Mangevilayn&quot; visited England is very doubtful. St Albans Abbey had a sapphire ring, and Canterbury a crystal orb, said to have been given by Mandeville; but these might have been sent from Liège, and it will appear later that the Liège physician possessed and wrote about precious stones. St Albans also had a legend, recorded in John Norden&#x27;s &quot;Speculum Britanniae&quot; (1596) that a ruined marble tomb of Mandeville (represented cross-legged and in armour, with sword and shield) once stood in the abbey; this may be true of &quot;Mangevilayn&quot; or it may be apocryphal. There is also an inscription near the entrance of St Albans Abbey, which reads as follows:

== Possible representation of genuine experiences ==
Even in those parts of the book which might be supposed to represent some genuine experience, there are the plainest traces that another work has been made use of. This is the itinerary of the German knight Wilhelm von Boldensele, written in 1336 at the desire of Cardinal Hélie de Talleyrand-Périgord. A cursory comparison of this with Mandeville leaves no doubt that the latter has followed its thread, though digressing on every side, and too often eliminating the singular good sense of the German traveler. Examples include Boldensele&#x27;s account of Cyprus, of Tyre and the coast of Palestine, of the journey from Gaza to Egypt, passages about Babylon of Egypt, about Mecca, the general account of Egypt, the pyramids, some of the wonders of Cairo, such as the slave-market, the chicken-hatching stoves, and the apples of paradise (i.e., plantains), the Red Sea, the convent on Sinai, the account of the church of the Holy Sepulchre, etc.

As an example, when discussing the pyramids, Boldensele wrote that &quot;the people of the country call them Pharaoh&#x27;s Granaries. But this cannot be true at all, for no place for putting in the wheat can be found there&quot;. Mandeville then completely reverses it in favor of the received medieval opinion: &quot;Some say that they are tombs of the great lords of antiquity, but that is not true, for the common word through the whole country near and far is that they are Joseph&#x27;s Granaries ... [for] if they were tombs, they would not be empty inside&quot;.

There is, indeed, only a small residuum of the book to which genuine character, as containing the experiences of the author, can possibly be attributed. Yet, as has been intimated, the borrowed stories are frequently claimed as such experiences. In addition to those already mentioned, he alleges that he had witnessed the curious exhibition of the garden of transmigrated souls (described by Odoric) at Cansay, i.e., Hangzhou. He and his fellows with their valets had remained fifteen months in service with Kublai Khan, the Emperor of Cathay in his wars against the King of Manzi, or Southern China, which had ceased to be a separate kingdom some seventy years before.

The most notable of these false statements occurs in his adoption from Odoric of the story of the &quot;Valley Perilous&quot;. This is, in its original form, apparently founded on real experiences of Odoric viewed through a haze of excitement and superstition. Mandeville, while swelling the wonders of the tale with a variety of extravagant touches, appears to safeguard himself from the reader&#x27;s possible discovery that it was stolen by the interpolation: &quot;And some of our fellows accorded to enter, and some not. So there were with us two worthy men, Friars Minor, that were of Lombardy, who said that if any man would enter they would go in with us. And when they had said so, upon the gracious trust of God and of them, we caused mass to be sung, and made every man to be shriven and houselled; and then we entered fourteen persons; but at our going out we were but nine&quot;.

In referring to this passage, it is only fair to recognize that the description (though the suggestion of the greatest part exists in Odoric) displays a good deal of imaginative power; and there is much in the account of Christian&#x27;s passage through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, in John Bunyan&#x27;s famous allegory, which indicates a possibility that Bunyan may have read and remembered this episode either in Mandeville or in Hakluyt&#x27;s &quot;Odoric&quot;.

It does not follow that the whole work is borrowed or fictitious. Even the great Moorish traveller Ibn Battuta, accurate and veracious in the main, seems—in one part at least of his narrative—to invent experiences; and, in such works as those of Jan van Hees and Arnold von Harff are examples of pilgrims to the Holy Land whose narratives begin apparently in sober truth, and gradually pass into flourishes of fiction and extravagance. In Mandeville also are particulars not yet traced to other writers, and which may therefore be provisionally assigned either to the writer&#x27;s own experience or to knowledge acquired by colloquial intercourse in the East.

Whether Mandeville actually travelled or not, he would not necessarily be intentionally making the story up. All travel narratives from this time used the same sources, taken from each other or from the earlier traditions of the Greeks. This tradition was an integral part of such narratives to make them believable (or at least acceptable) to the readers.

===On Egypt===
It is difficult to decide on the character of his statements as to recent Egyptian history. In his account of that country, though the series of the Comanian (of the Bahri dynasty) sultans is borrowed from Hetoum down to the accession of Mel echnasser (Al-Nasir Muhammad), who came first to the throne in 1293, Mandeville appears to speak from his own knowledge when he adds that this &quot;Melechnasser reigned long and governed wisely&quot;. In fact, though twice displaced in the early part of his life, Al-Nasir Muhammad reigned until 1341, a duration unparalleled in Muslim Egypt, while the work describes that during the last thirty years of his reign, Egypt rose to a high pitch of wealth and prosperity.

Mandeville, however, then goes on to say that his eldest son, Melechemader, was chosen to succeed; but this prince was caused privily to be slain by his brother, who took the kingdom under the name of Meleclimadabron. &quot;And he was Soldan when I departed from those countries&quot;. Now Al-Nasir Muhammad was followed in succession by no less than eight of his sons in thirteen years, the first three of whom reigned in aggregate only a few months. The names mentioned by Mandeville appear to represent those of the fourth and sixth of the eight, viz. al-Salih Ismail and al-Muzzafar Hajji; and these the statements of Mandeville do not fit.

===Words===
On several occasions, Arabic words are given, but are not always recognizable, owing perhaps to the carelessness of copyists in such matters. Thus, we find the names (not satisfactorily identified) of the wood, fruit and sap of the Himalayan Balsam; of bitumen, &quot;alkatran&quot; (&quot;al-Kāṭrān&quot;); of the three different kinds of pepper (long pepper, black pepper and white pepper) as &quot;sorbotin, fulful&quot; and &quot;bano&quot; or &quot;bauo&quot; (&quot;fulful&quot; is the common Arabic word for pepper; the others have not been satisfactorily explained). But these, and the particulars of his narrative for which no literary sources have yet been found, are too few to constitute a proof of personal experience.

===Geographic===
Mandeville, again, in some passages shows a correct idea of the form of the earth, and of position in latitude ascertained by observation of the pole star; he knows that there are antipodes, and that if ships were sent on voyages of discovery they might sail round the world. And he tells a curious story, which he had heard in his youth, how a worthy man did travel ever eastward until he came to his own country again. But he repeatedly asserts the old belief that Jerusalem was in the centre of the world, and maintains in proof of this that at the equinox a spear planted erect in Jerusalem casts no shadow at noon, which, if true, would equally consist with the sphericity of the earth, provided that the city were on the equator.

==Manuscripts and translations==
The oldest known manuscript of the original—once Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Barrois&#x27;s, afterwards Bertram Ashburnham, 4th Earl of Ashburnham&#x27;s, now &quot;Nouv. Acq. Franc. 4515&quot; in the Bibliothèque nationale de France—is dated 1371, but is nevertheless very inaccurate in proper names. An early printed Latin translation made from the French has been already quoted, but four others, unprinted, have been discovered by Johann Vogels. They exist in eight manuscripts, of which seven are in Great Britain, while the eighth was copied by a monk of Abingdon; probably, therefore, all these unprinted translations were executed in Great Britain.

From one of them, according to Vogels, an English version was made which has never been printed and is now extant only in free abbreviations, contained in two 15th-century manuscripts in the Bodleian Library—manuscript &quot;e Museo 116&quot;, and manuscript &quot;Rawlinson D.99&quot;: the former, which is the better, is in East Midlands English, and may possibly have belonged to the Augustinian priory of St Osyth in Essex, while the latter is in Southern Middle English.

The first English translation direct from the French was made (at least as early as the beginning of the 15th century) from a manuscript of which many pages were lost. Writing of the name &#x27;Califfes&#x27;, the author says that it is &quot;taut a dire come rol (s). II y soleit auoir V. soudans&quot; &quot;as much as to say king. There used to be 5 sultans&quot;. In the defective French manuscript a page ended with &quot;Il y so&quot;; then came a gap, and the next page went on with part of the description of Mount Sinai, &quot;Et est celle vallee mult froide&quot;. Consequently, the corresponding English version has &quot;That ys to say amonge hem &quot;Roys Ils&quot; and this vale ys ful colde&quot;! All English printed texts before 1725, and Ashton&#x27;s 1887 edition, follow these defective copies, and in only two known manuscripts has the lacuna been detected and filled up.

One of them is the British Library manuscript Egerton MS 1982 (Northern dialect, about 1410–1420 ?), in which, according to Vogels, the corresponding portion has been borrowed from that English version which had already been made from the Latin. The other is in the British Library manuscript &quot;Cotton Titus xvi.&quot; (Midland dialect, about 1410–1420?), representing a text completed, and revised throughout, from the French, though not by a competent hand. The &quot;Egerton text&quot;, edited by George Warner, has been printed by the Roxburghe Club, while the Cotton text, first printed in 1725–27, is in modern reprints the current English version.

That none of the forms of the English version can be from the same hand which wrote the original is made patent by their glaring errors of translation, but the Cotton text asserts in the preface that it was made by Mandeville himself, and this assertion was until lately taken on trust by almost all modern historians of English literature. The words of the original &quot;je eusse cest livret mis en latin ... mais ... je l&#x27;ay mis en rōmant&quot; were mistranslated as if &quot;je eusse&quot; meant &quot;I had&quot; instead of &quot;I should have&quot;, and then (whether of fraudulent intent or by the error of a copyist thinking to supply an accidental omission) the words were added &quot;and translated it aȝen out of Frensche into Englyssche.&quot; Mätzner seems to have been the first to show that the current English text cannot possibly have been made by Mandeville himself. Of the original French there is no satisfactory edition, but Vogels has undertaken a critical text, and Warner has added to his Egerton English text the French of a British Library manuscript, with variants from three others.

An illuminated Middle English copy c. 1440, possibly from Bersted, Kent, fetched £289,250 at a London auction in June 2011.

Mandeville&#x27;s work was translated into Early Modern Irish around 1475.

==Other works using the name==
There are certain other works bearing the name of Mandeville or de Bourgogne.

MS. Add. C. 280 in the Bodleian appends to the &quot;Travels&quot; a short French life of St Alban of Germany, the author of which calls himself Johan Mandivill[e], knight, formerly of the town of St Alban, and says he writes to correct an impression prevalent among his countrymen that there was no other saint of the name: this life is followed by part of a French herbal.

To Mandeville (by whom de Bourgogne is clearly meant) Jean d&#x27;Outremeuse ascribes a Latin &quot;lappidaire selon l&#x27;oppinion des Indois&quot;, from which he quotes twelve passages, stating that the author (whom he calls knight, lord of Montfort, of Castelperouse, and of the isle of Campdi) had been &quot;baillez en Alexandrie&quot; seven years, and had been presented by a Saracen friend with some fine jewels which had passed into d&#x27;Outremeuse&#x27;s own possession: of this Lapidaire, a French version, which seems to have been completed after 1479, has been several times printed. A manuscript of Mandeville&#x27;s travels offered for sale in 1862 is said to have been divided into five books:
#The travels
#&quot;De là forme de la terre et comment et par quelle manière elle fut faite&quot;
#&quot;De la forme del ciel&quot;
#&quot;Des herbes selon les yndois et les phulosophes par de là&quot;
#&quot;Ly lapidaire&quot;
while the cataloguer supposed Mandeville to have been the author of a concluding piece entitled &quot;La Venianche de nostre Signeur Jhesu-Crist fayle par Vespasian fit del empereur de Romme et commeet lozeph daramathye fu deliures de la prizon&quot;. From the treatise on herbs a passage is quoted asserting it to have been composed in 1357 in honour of the author&#x27;s natural lord, Edward III, king of England. This date is corroborated by the title of king of Scotland given to Edward, who had received from Baliol the surrender of the crown and kingly dignity on 20 January 1356, but on 3 October 1357 released King David and made peace with Scotland: unfortunately it is not recorded whether the treatise contains the author&#x27;s name, and, if so, what name.

Tanner (&quot;Bibliotheca&quot;) alleges that Mandeville wrote several books on medicine, and among the &quot;Ashmolean manuscripts&quot; in the Bodleian Library are a medical receipt by John de Magna Villa (No. 2479), an aichemical receipt by him (No. 1407), and another alchemical receipt by Johannes de Villa Magna (No. 1441).

Finally, de Bourgogne wrote under his own name a treatise on the plague, extant in Latin, French and English texts, and in Latin and English abridgments. Herein he describes himself as Johannes de Burgundia, otherwise called cum Barba, citizen of Liège and professor of the art of medicine; says that he had practised forty years and had been in Liège in the plague of 1365; and adds that he had previously written a treatise on the cause of the plague, according to the indications of astrology (beginning &quot;Deus deorum&quot;) and another on distinguishing pestilential diseases (beginning &quot;Cum nimium propter instans tempus epidimiate&quot;). &quot;Burgundia&quot; is sometimes corrupted into &quot;Burdegalia&quot;, and in English translations of the abridgment almost always appears as &quot;Burdews&quot; (Bordeaux, France) or the like manuscript &quot;Rawlinson D. 251&quot; (15th century) in the Bodleian Library also contains a large number of English medical receipts, headed &quot;Practica phisicalia Magistri Johannis de Burgundia&quot;.

==Dedications==
* The orchestral work &quot;Hoc Vinces!&quot; by Svitlana Azarova is &quot;dedicated Sir John Mandeville, and people like him, who inspired others to perform great feats (Christopher Columbus, Da Vinci and Shakespeare), and to people who perpetuate &quot;spirit&quot; from generation to generation&quot;

<text>Cyr Joseph Ulysse Chevalier (24 February 1841 – 27 October 1923) was a French Catholic priest, bibliographer, and historian who specialized in the European Middle Ages. He is principally remembered for his (&quot;Repertory of historical sources on the Middle Ages&quot;) and for his critical work on the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin and the Holy House of Loreto.

== Life and works ==

Chevalier was born in 1841 Rambouillet in the Île-de-France region, where his father was stationed as a military physician. In 1852 the family returned to its hometown in Romans-sur-Isère in southeastern France, where Chevalier pursued ecclesiastical studies and was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1867. Under the guidance of Léopold Victor Delisle, to whom he had been recommended, Chevalier launched a scholarly career focused primarily on the history of the Dauphiné.

Chevalier&#x27;s historical works include studies of the cartularies of the church and of the town of Die (1868), of the abbey of Saint-André-le-Bas in Vienne (1869), of Bonnevaux Abbey (1889), and of the abbey of Saint-Chaffre at Le Monastier-sur-Gazeille (1884). Chevalier also compiled inventories of the archives of the dauphins of Viennois, and a &quot;Bibliothèque liturgique&quot; in six volumes (1893–1897), the third and fourth volumes of which constitute the &quot;Repertorium hymnologicum&quot;, containing more than 20,000 articles.

Chevalier&#x27;s principal scholarly contribution is the . The first part, &quot;Bio-bibliographie&quot; (1875–1886), contains the names of all the historical personages alive between the years 1 and 1500 who are mentioned in printed books, together with precise references. The second part, &quot;Topo-bibliographie&quot; (1894–1903), contains not only the names of places mentioned in books on the history of the Middle Ages, but, in a general way, everything not included in the &quot;Bio-bibliographie&quot;.

=== Shroud of Turin ===

Chevalier was noted for his independent and critical attitude towards the study of relics. Between 1899 and 1903 he published several studies arguing that the Shroud of Turin could not be the actual burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth, but dated instead from the 14th century. Chevalier brought to light a memorandum from 1389 in which the Bishop of Troyes declared that the Shroud was a clever forgery and that the artist responsible had confessed to it years before.

Chevalier&#x27;s work on the Shroud of Turin generated controversy within the Catholic Church during his lifetime. More recently, defenders of the Shroud&#x27;s authenticity like the paleographer Emmanuel Poulle have accused Chevalier of manipulating the historical documents to make his case. Meanwhile historians skeptical of the Shroud such as Prof. Andrea Nicolotti of University of Turin have defended the rigour of Chevalier&#x27;s work. Chevalier&#x27;s conclusion that the Shroud of Turin was fabricated shortly before it was first exhibited in 1355 at the collegiate church of Lirey, in northeastern France, is consistent with the results of the 1988 carbon dating results, which found that the linen cloth of the Shroud had been made between the years 1260 and 1390.

=== Holy House of Loreto ===

In 1906 Chevalier published the book (&quot;Our Lady of Loreto. Critical Study of the authenticity of the Holy House&quot;). There Chevalier studied the history behind the pious legend according to which the house of Mary the mother of Jesus had been transported by angels from Nazareth to Tersatto (in modern Croatia) and then to Loreto in Italy, where it forms the centerpiece of the &quot;Basilica della Santa Casa&quot;. Chevalier found that no authentic documents mention that miraculous translation until 1472, 180 years after it was alleged to have taken place, and that there are no records of any comparable edifice having been venerated in Nazareth as the home of Mary.

== Influence and recognition ==

In 1881, Chevalier became professor of archaeology at the seminary of Romans-sur-Isère in 1881. In 1887, he was appointed professor of church history at the Catholic Institute of Lyon, a post he held until 1906. He was elected to the &quot;Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres&quot; in 1912, and in 1922 he was appointed by the French government as officer of the Legion of Honour. He also received honorary doctorates from the universities of Louvain, Oxford, and Leipzig. 

Within the Catholic Church, Chevalier was appointed honorary canon of the cathedrals of Valence, Lyon, Marseille, Grenoble, and Bayeux. His work on relics was notably promoted by the English Jesuit Herbert Thurston.

<text>Richard Rawlinson FRS (3 January 1690 – 6 April 1755) was an English clergyman and antiquarian collector of books and manuscripts, which he bequeathed to the Bodleian Library, Oxford.

==Life==
Richard Rawlinson was a younger son of Sir Thomas Rawlinson (1647–1708), Lord Mayor of the City of London in 1705–6, and a brother of Thomas Rawlinson (1681–1725), the bibliophile who ruined himself in the South Sea Company, at whose sale in 1734 Richard bought many of the Orientalia. He was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, at Eton College, and at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford. In 1714, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, where he was inducted by Newton. Rawlinson was a Jacobite and maintained a strong support for the exiled Stuart royal family throughout his life. In 1716 was ordained as a deacon and then priest in the nonjuring Church of England (see Nonjuring schism), the ceremony being performed by the non-juring Usager bishop, Jeremy Collier. Rawlinson was, in 1728, consecrated as a bishop in the nonjuring church by Bishops Gandy, Blackbourne and Doughty. On Blackbourne&#x27;s death in 1741 he became the senior nonjuring bishop in London, and still maintained a congregation into the mid-1740s. He was particularly concerned with collecting the history and archives of the nonjurors, but later squabbled with his fellow bishops in continuing the succession with the consecration of Robert Gordon. 

Rawlinson travelled in England and on the continent of Europe, where he passed several years, making very diverse collections of books, manuscripts, pictures and curiosities of manuscripts, coins and curiosities, his books alone forming three libraries, English, foreign and Classical. 

Rawlinson was a friend of the antiquarian Thomas Hearne and, among his voluminous writings, published a &quot;Life&quot; of the antiquary Anthony Wood.

Towards the end of his life, Rawlinson quarrelled with both the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries. Cutting the Society of Antiquaries from his bequests, he began transferring his collections to the Bodleian. Among his collection was a copperplate known as the Bodleian Plate depicting structures in Williamsburg, Virginia. A series of almanacs in 175 volumes, ranging in date from 1607 to 1747 arrived in 1752–55. At his death, Rawlinson left to the Library 5,205 manuscripts bound in volumes that include many rare broadsides and other printed ephemera, his curiosities, and some other property that endowed a professorship of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University. The Rawlinsonian Professor of Anglo-Saxon was first appointed in 1795. He was also a benefactor to St John&#x27;s College, Oxford.

He died at Islington, London.

Richard Rawlinson is buried at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, allegedly holding the skull of Christopher Layer, an executed Jacobite.
. Rawlinson Road in North Oxford is named after him.

<text>Information Processing Language (IPL) is a programming language created by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert A. Simon at RAND Corporation and the Carnegie Institute of Technology about 1956. Newell had the job of language specifier-application programmer, Shaw was the system programmer, and Simon had the job of application programmer-user.

The code includes features intended to help with programs that perform simple problem solving actions such as lists, dynamic memory allocation, data types, recursion, functions as arguments, generators, and cooperative multitasking. IPL invented the concept of list processing, albeit in an assembly-language style.

==Basics of IPL==
An IPL computer has:

# A set of &quot;symbols&quot;. All symbols are addresses, and name cells. Unlike symbols in later languages, symbols consist of a character followed by a number, and are written H1, A29, 9–7, 9–100.
## Cell names beginning with a letter are &quot;regional&quot;, and are absolute addresses.
## Cell names beginning with &quot;9-&quot; are &quot;local&quot;, and are meaningful within the context of a single list. One list&#x27;s 9-1 is independent of another list&#x27;s 9–1.
## Other symbols (e.g., pure numbers) are &quot;internal&quot;.
# A set of &quot;cells&quot;. Lists are made from several cells including mutual references. Cells have several fields: 
## P, a 3-bit field used for an operation code when the cell is used as an instruction, and unused when the cell is data.
## Q, a 3-valued field used for indirect reference when the cell is used as an instruction, and unused when the cell is data.
## SYMB, a symbol used as the value in the cell.
# A set of &quot;primitive processes&quot;, which would be termed &quot;primitive functions&quot; in modern languages.

The data structure of IPL is the list, but lists are more intricate structures than in many languages. A list consists of a singly linked sequence of symbols, as might be expected—plus some &quot;description lists&quot;, which are subsidiary singly linked lists interpreted as alternating attribute names and values. IPL provides primitives to access and mutate attribute value by name. The description lists are given local names (of the form 9–1). So, a list named L1 containing the symbols S4 and S5, and described by associating value V1 to attribute A1 and V2 to A2, would be stored as follows. 0 indicates the end of a list; the cell names 100, 101, etc. are automatically generated internal symbols whose values are irrelevant. These cells can be scattered throughout memory; only L1, which uses a regional name that must be globally known, needs to reside in a specific place.

IPL is an assembly language for manipulating lists. It has a few cells which are used as special-purpose registers. H1, for example, is the program counter. The SYMB field of H1 is the name of the current instruction. However, H1 is interpreted as a list; the LINK of H1 is, in modern terms, a pointer to the beginning of the call stack. For example, subroutine calls push the SYMB of H1 onto this stack.

H2 is the free-list. Procedures which need to allocate memory grab cells off of H2; procedures which are finished with memory put it on H2. On entry to a function, the list of parameters is given in H0; on exit, the results should be returned in H0. Many procedures return a boolean result indicating success or failure, which is put in H5. Ten cells, W0-W9, are reserved for public working storage. Procedures are &quot;morally bound&quot; (to quote the CACM article) to save and restore the values of these cells.

There are eight instructions, based on the values of P: subroutine call, push/pop S to H0; push/pop the symbol in S to the list attached to S; copy value to S; conditional branch. In these instructions, S is the target. S is either the value of the SYMB field if Q=0, the symbol in the cell named by SYMB if Q=1, or the symbol in the cell named by the symbol in the cell named by SYMB if Q=2. In all cases but conditional branch, the LINK field of the cell tells which instruction to execute next.

IPL has a library of some 150 basic operations. These include such operations as:

* Test symbols for equality
* Find, set, or erase an attribute of a list
* Locate the next symbol in a list; insert a symbol in a list; erase or copy an entire list
* Arithmetic operations (on symbol names)
* Manipulation of symbols; e.g., test if a symbol denotes an integer, or make a symbol local
* I/O operations 
* &quot;Generators&quot;, which correspond to iterators and filters in functional programming. For example, a generator may accept a list of numbers and produce the list of their squares. Generators could accept suitably designed functions—strictly, the addresses of code of suitably designed functions—as arguments.

==History==
IPL was first utilized to demonstrate that the theorems in &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; which were proven laboriously by hand, by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead, could in fact be proven by computation. According to Simon&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Models of My Life&quot;, this application was originally developed first by hand simulation, using his children as the computing elements, while writing on and holding up note cards as the registers which contained the state variables of the program.

IPL was used to implement several early artificial intelligence programs, also by the same authors: the Logic Theorist (1956), the General Problem Solver (1957), and their computer chess program NSS (1958).

Several versions of IPL were created: IPL-I (never implemented), IPL-II (1957 for JOHNNIAC), IPL-III (existed briefly), IPL-IV, IPL-V (1958, for IBM 650, IBM 704, IBM 7090, Philco model 212, many others. Widely used). IPL-VI was a proposal for an IPL hardware.

A co-processor “IPL-VC” for the CDC 3600 at Argonne National Libraries was developed which could run IPL-V commands. It was used to implement another checker-playing program. This hardware implementation did not improve running times sufficiently to “compete favorably with a language more directly oriented to the structure of present-day machines”.

IPL was soon displaced by Lisp, which had much more powerful features, a simpler syntax, and the benefit of automatic garbage collection.

==Legacy to computer programming==
IPL arguably introduced several programming language features: 
* &quot;List manipulation&quot;—but only lists of atoms, not general lists
* &quot;Property lists&quot;—but only when attached to other lists
* &quot;Higher-order functions&quot;—while assembly programming had always allowed computing with the addresses of functions, IPL was an early attempt to generalize this property of assembly language in a principled way
* &quot;Computation with symbols&quot;—though symbols have a restricted form in IPL (letter followed by number)
* &quot;Virtual machine&quot;

Many of these features were generalized, rationalized, and incorporated into Lisp and from there into many other programming languages during the next several decades.

<text>Santa with Muscles is a 1996 American Christmas comedy film starring Hulk Hogan and directed by John Murlowski. It was released for two weeks in cinemas.

==Plot==
The movie starts off with Elizabeth (Aria Curzon) writing a letter to Santa, explaining that the citizens of Lakeville have left because of an evil scientist named Ebner Frost (Ed Begley Jr.) who plans to buy the orphanage. He bullies Mr. Rini into selling his shoe store with the help of his henchmen, Drs. Blight, Watt, Flint, and Vial. Rizi relents, and the orphanage is the last to be targeted.

Blake Thorn (Hulk Hogan), a conceited self-made millionaire who sells bodybuilding supplements and equipment that have his picture on them, practices exercises with his staff before joining up with his paintball squad. He is targeted by police including an officer named Hinkley (Clint Howard) after he and his friends are speeding. Abandoning them, he hides out at a shopping mall that is waiting for their mall Santa to show, and changes into a Santa costume. He manages to trick Hinkley and another officer at first who are looking for him, until Hickey spots Thorn’s paintball uniform and gives chase again. Blake hides out in a garbage chute, but as the officers leave a janitor throws a big Christmas display that knocks Blake out and sends him down to the bottom floor. An elf named Lenny (Don Stark) assumes him to be another drunk mall Santa and proceeds to rob him from his money, until he realizes that he’s hit the jackpot upon finding Blake’s ID. Blake has no memory of his name when he comes to, but Lenny convinces him that he’s Santa.

Blake assumes the identity of mall Santa for the kids, until he sees two people steal money that has been set aside to help the orphanage. Santa battles the two crooks, and gets a rousing applause by the long line of people at the mall. Upon seeing a picture of the orphanage, Blake goes to visit the orphanage, and helps out after Blight almost runs his ice cream truck over Clayton (Garret Morris). Blake meets Leslie (Robin Curtis) and the last three children remaining: Taylor (Adam Wylie), Sarah (Mila Kunis) and Elizabeth. He is interviewed by the news when the local papers refer to Blake/Santa as ’Santa with Muscles’. It is also revealed that Lenny owes a sum of money to both Frost and Blight, and Frost wants Lenny to get the Santa out of the orphanage, not realizing that Santa is Blake.

Blake helps out when the orphanage gets attacked by Blight and Vial, but he manages to fend off their attacks. Taylor heads off to deal with Ebner Frost at his mansion, but Blake catches him and has Lenny take him back to the orphanage. Blake asks the kids if there’s anything special about the place, and the kids mention an underground vault. They kids figured out the three combination numbers, but they have trouble with the fourth. Blake figures out the fourth number and opens the vault to reveal geode-like magical crystals. Blake stays to figure out how he knew the combination, while Lenny goes upstairs with the rest of the group.

The next morning, Blake fends off another attack from Blight and his henchmen but a decorated Santa Claus pushes him out and falls onto a garbage truck. He wakes up in his mansion, and gathers his staff to help fight back against Frost. However, they speed past Hinkley again and are given chase. They manage to outrun the police but they are stopped by other patrol cars who try to blow up Thorn&#x27;s vehicle with a rocket launcher, but they end up destroying Hinkley&#x27;s car instead.

He rescues the kids as well as Leslie and Clayton, the latter revealing that the once grew up in the orphanage with Ebner as his best friend until they had a falling out. They all defeat the henchmen, and Lenny helps out as well, having felt guilty about betraying the orphanage. Frost and his henchmen are arrested, but the orphanage is destroyed due to the overload of the crystals. Frost&#x27;s compound is now the new orphanage founded and helped run by Blake. Many more orphans have joined since then. They all watch through a telescope at Frost and his henchman doing hard labor in the prison yard.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was released on 8 November 1996, the film garnered $120,932 in box office receipts during its opening weekend and grossed a total of $220,198 during its two-week run.

===Critical response===
Film critic Emanuel Levy gave the film a score of 2 out of 5. Joe Leydon in &quot;Variety&quot; described &quot;Santa with Muscles&quot; as a &quot;weakling of a comedy&quot; and thought that Hogan&#x27;s performance was lacking the charisma of his previous work such as &quot;Suburban Commando&quot;. Leydon panned the direction in particular, stating: &quot;Working from an irredeemably bland screenplay, John Murlowski directs with all the enthusiasm of someone going through the motions to pay off a debt.&quot; Chris Hicks, writing for the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, stated that films such as &quot;Santa with Muscles&quot; make films like &quot;Jingle All The Way&quot; look better, and said that Hulk Hogan &quot;makes Arnold Schwarzenegger seem like Laurence Olivier&quot;. MaryAnn Johanson of &quot;Flick Filosopher&quot; called it &quot;a deeply awful comedy&quot; and &quot;Believe me, it’s even dumber than it sounds.&quot;

===Legacy===
Reception for &quot;Santa with Muscles&quot; has continued to be negative. As of December 2011 it was listed at number 62 on IMDB&#x27;s bottom 100 movies. It was listed as number 43 out of 50 worst children&#x27;s films by &quot;Total Film&quot;, and was included in Virgin Media&#x27;s list of worst Christmas movies. The film was also included on &quot;Atlantic City Weekly&quot;&#x27;s list of worst holiday films, ranking third behind &quot;Santa Claus Conquers the Martians&quot; and the &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;. Due to Hogan&#x27;s starring role, the film has been featured on the website Wrestlecrap, which acts as a &quot;Hall of Shame&quot; for the worst gimmicks and storylines in pro wrestling history. When Golden Globe nominee Mila Kunis, who made her film debut, was asked about the film in 2011 by &quot;GQ&quot; magazine, she said, &quot;I was too young to fully understand the importance of working with Hulk Hogan. I just thought he was this huge man&quot;, while comparing the film to &quot;American Psycho 2&quot; in which she co-starred with William Shatner. In 2021, &quot;Santa with Muscles&quot; was featured on the YouTube channel RedLetterMedia as part of their series, &quot;Best of the Worst.&quot;

<text>An infomercial is a form of television commercial that resembles regular TV programming yet is intended to promote or sell a product, service or idea. It generally includes a toll-free telephone number or website. Most often used as a form of direct response television (DRTV), they are often &quot;programlength commercials&quot; (long-form infomercials), and are typically 28:30 or 58:30 minutes in length. Infomercials are also known as paid programming (or teleshopping in Europe). This phenomenon started in the United States, where infomercials were typically shown overnight and early morning (usually 1:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.), outside peak prime time hours for commercial broadcasters. Some television stations chose to air infomercials as an alternative to the former practice of signing off, while other channels air infomercials 24 hours a day. Some stations also choose to air infomercials during the daytime hours, mostly on weekends, to fill in for unscheduled network or syndicated programming. By 2009, most infomercial spending in the U.S. occurred outside of the traditional overnight hours. Stations in most countries around the world have instituted similar media structures. The infomercial industry is worth over $200 billion.

Washington, D.C.–based National Infomercial Marketing Association was formed in late 1990; by 1993, &quot;it had more than 200&quot; members committed to standards &quot;with teeth&quot;.

While the term &quot;infomercial&quot; was originally applied only to television advertising, it is now sometimes used to refer to any presentation (often on video) which presents a significant amount of information in an actual, or perceived, attempt to promote a point of view. When used this way, the term may be meant to carry an implication that the party making the communication or political speech is exaggerating truths or hiding important facts.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; cited a professional in the field as saying that &quot;infomercial companies tend to do well during recessions.&quot;

==Format==
The word &quot;infomercial&quot; is a portmanteau of the words &quot;information&quot; and &quot;commercial&quot;. As in any other form of advertisement, the content is a commercial message designed to represent the viewpoints and to serve the interest of the sponsor. Infomercials are often made to closely resemble standard television programs. Some imitate talk shows and try to downplay the fact that the program is a commercial message. A few are developed around storylines and have been called &quot;storymercials&quot;. However, most do not have specific TV formats but craft different elements to tell what their creators hope is a compelling story about the product offered.

The term &quot;infomercial&quot;, by 2007, had come to refer to the format, even when used in a live presentation.

Infomercials are designed to solicit quantifiable immediate direct response (a form of direct response marketing, not to be confused with direct marketing); they generally feature between two and four internal commercials of 30 to 120 seconds which invite the viewer to call or take other direct action. Many viewers respond with a delayed response, by purchases made at retail outlets. These retail purchases are often the largest response. Using &quot;not sold in stores&quot; is a choice by advertisers who dislike sharing profit with retailers, or who lack the immense resources needed to get into retail channels. In the latter case, direct sales enables later retail distribution. Standalone shorter commercials, 30 to 120 seconds in length with a call to action, are erroneously called infomercials; when used as an independently produced commercial, they are generally known as &quot;DRTV spots&quot; or &quot;shortform DRTV&quot;. Infomercial sponsors often also use shorter spots during regular programming.

=== Products using infomercial marketing ===

The products frequently marketed through infomercials at the national level include cleaning products, appliances, food-preparation devices, dietary supplements, alternative health aids, memory improvement courses, books, compilation albums, videos of numerous genres, real estate investment strategies, beauty supplies, baldness remedies, sexual-enhancement supplements, weight-loss programs and products, personal fitness devices, home exercise machines and adult chat lines.

Uses for infomercials in the early 1990s included offering free trials of personal care products such as enhanced plaque removers; an 800-number was used to collect basic marketing information.

Major brands (such as Apple, Microsoft and Thermos-Grill2Go) have used infomercials for their ability to communicate more complicated and indepth product stories. This practice started in the early 1990s and has increased since. Such advertisers generally eschew the less reputable trappings of the traditional infomercial business in order to create communication they believe creates a better image of their products, brands and customers. Apple&#x27;s use of the infomercial medium was immediately discontinued with Steve Jobs&#x27; 1997 return to the helm of the company.

Automobile dealerships, attorneys and jewelers are among the types of businesses that air infomercials on a local level.

== History ==

=== Early infomercials ===
During the early days of television, many television shows were specifically created by sponsors with the main goal of selling their product, the entertainment angle being a hook to hold audience&#x27;s attention (this is how soap operas got their name; such shows were sponsored by soap manufacturers). A good example of this is the early children&#x27;s show &quot;The Magic Clown&quot; on NBC, which was created essentially as an advertisement for Bonomo&#x27;s Turkish Taffy.
The first filmed for TV half-hour infomercial for a commercial product (a Vitamix blender) were produced by Cinécraft Productions, a motion picture studio in Ohio in 1949. ran the infomercial from 12:30 to 1 a.m. on a Sunday. By 1:10 a.m., 130 orders had rolled in. Eleven subsequent showings of the infomercial brought in more than $41,400 in 1950 dollars.

Eventually, limits imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on the amount of advertising that could appear during an hour of television did away with these programs, forcing sponsors into the background; however, a few infomercials, mainly those for greatest hits record sets (which could get around the restrictions by devoting much of the airtime to snippets of the songs on the records, which did not count as advertising) and Shop Smith power tools, did exist during the period when commercial time was restricted.

During the 1970s, XETV-TDTa Mexican TV station based in Tijuana, but serving the San Diego marketran a one-hour English-language program on Sundays showcasing San Diego–area homes for sale. As a non-USA station, the FCC&#x27;s maximum number of commercial minutes per hour did not apply to XETV. It was also during the 1970s that the hard sell &quot;But wait! There&#x27;s more!&quot; Ginsu ads were being aired on American late-night TV.
=== 1981 ===
The Federal Communications Commission lifted the prohibition on program-length advertisements on radio in 1981.

=== After 1984 ===
Infomercials proliferated in the United States after 1984 when the Federal Communications Commission eliminated regulations that were established in the 1950s and 1960s to govern the commercial content of television.

Kevin Harrington, nicknamed the &quot;infomercial godfather&quot;, had his first infomercial air in 1985. By 1994, an estimated 91% of all stations had or were airing infomercials.

==== Product or person as pitchman ====
One relatively early question was whether or not infomercials should feature celebrities. Although &quot;how much will it cost&quot; was part of the equation, so was a &quot;highly demonstrable item with obvious features and benefits.&quot; Even when experts are used for their endorsement value, a &quot;name&quot; adds value in making an introduction.

Infomercials particularly exploded in the mid-1990s with motivational and personal development products, and &quot;get-rich-quick schemes&quot; based on the premise that one could quickly become wealthy by either selling anything through classified ads or through flipping. These were hawked by personalities such as Don Lapre and Carleton H. Sheets, among others.

==== When and where ====
When they first appeared, infomercials were most often scheduled in the United States and Canada during late-night/early morning hours. As stations have found value in airing them at other times, a large portion of infomercial spending occurs in the early morning, daytime, early prime and even prime time periods. There are also all-infomercial networks (such as cable channels Corner Store TV, OnTV4U, Access Television Network and GRTV) that yield revenue for cable and satellite providers who carry them or fill local programming voids.

Some cable carriage contracts were adjusted in 2006. CNBC, which airs only two hours of infomercials nightly during the business week, sometimes airs nearly 30 hours of infomercials on weekends; from the September–October 2008 financial crisis to early 2017, CNBC had inserted a &quot;paid programming&quot; bug at the top right corner of the screen during all airings of infomercials. In contrast, sister network CNBC World airs international programming rather than any paid programming.

When a conventional prime-time two-minute advertising pod has no ads, the networks will run a two-minute mini-infomercial at a much lower rate, charging &quot;as little as 5 percent of what a general advertiser would&quot; pay.

==== Commercials becoming full programs ====
&quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that &quot;the commercial became the show as infomercials ruled the night.&quot;

A comparison of television listings from 2007 with 1987 verifies that many North American broadcasters began to air infomercials in lieu of syndicated television series reruns and movies, which were formerly staples during the more common hours infomercials are broadcast (such as the overnight hours). Infomercials were previously a near-permanent staple of Ion Television&#x27;s daytime and overnight schedules, but the channel now only carries infomercials in the traditional 3:00–8:00 a.m. ET/PT timeslot emulated by most cable networks. Multichannel providers such as DirecTV had objected to carrying Ion feeds consisting largely of paid programming. This is despite both DirecTV and Dish carrying several infomercial-only and leased access networks which have been criticized by their subscribers.

=== United Kingdom ===
As with other advertising, content is supervised by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and regulated by Ofcom. Advertising rules are written and maintained by the Committees of Advertising Practice (CAP), working closely with the ASA and Ofcom.

In the UK, &quot;admags&quot; (advertisement magazines) were originally a feature of the regional commercial ITV stations from launch in 1955. While very popular, admags were banned in 1963. The word &quot;teleshopping&quot; was coined in 1979 by Michael Aldrich, who invented real-time transaction processing from a domestic television and subsequently installed many systems throughout the UK in the 1980s. This would now be referred to as online shopping. In the 1989, the &quot;Satellite Shop&quot; was launched as the first UK shopping channel. Shortly afterwards, infomercials began on satellite television, and they became known as &quot;teleshopping&quot;. Until 2009, the UK permitted neither paid infomercials nor teleshopping on broadcast television. However, in 2009, Ofcom allowed up to three hours of infomercials per day on any channel.

Airtime for political messages, known as party political broadcasts, is allocated free of charge to political parties according to a formula approved by Parliament, and is available only on broadcast television and radio channels. The Communications Act 2003 prohibits political advertising. Television advertising of pharmacy-only and prescription drugs is also prohibited.

=== Televangelists ===
Some U.S. televangelists such as Robert Tilton and Peter Popoff buy television time from infomercial brokers representing television stations around the U.S., and even some widely distributed cable networks that are not averse to carrying religious programming. A block of such programming appears weekdays on BET under the umbrella title &quot;BET Inspiration&quot; (which fully replaced the direct-response variety of infomercials on the channel in 1997). The vast majority of religious programming in the United States is distributed through paid infomercial time; the fees that televangelists pay for coverage on most religious stations are a major revenue stream for those stations, in addition to programming the networks produce themselves.

=== TiVo ===
TiVo formerly used paid programming time weekly on the Discovery Channel on early Thursday mornings and Ion Television on early Wednesday mornings to record interactive and video content to be presented to subscribers in a form of linear datacasting without the need to interfere with a subscriber&#x27;s internet bandwidth (or lack thereof if they solely used the machine&#x27;s dialup connection for updating). The program was listed as &quot;Teleworld Paid Program&quot;, named for TiVo&#x27;s corporate name at its founding. &quot;Teleworld Paid Program&quot; was quietly discontinued at the start of the 2016–17 television season as the company&#x27;s install base had mostly transitioned to broadband and newer TiVo devices no longer included a dialup option.

=== The 2008 financial crisis ===
During the financial crisis that lasted from 2007 to 2008, many struggling individual television stations began to devote more of their programming schedules to infomercials, thereby reducing syndication contracts for regular programming. Some stations found that the revenue from infomercial-time sales were higher than those possible through traditional television advertising and syndication sales options. However, the reduced ratings from airing infomercials can have a chain reaction and harm ratings for other programming on the station.

A feature-length documentary that chronicles the history of the infomercial is &quot;Pitch People&quot;.

In 2008, Tribune Content Agency and Gemstar-TV Guide/Rovi began to relax the guidelines for listing infomercials within their electronic program guide listings. Previously, all infomercials were listed under the title &quot;Paid Programming&quot; (except for exceptions listed below), but now infomercial producers are allowed to submit a title and limited descriptive synopsis (though phone numbers or website addresses remain disallowed) to the listings providers.

=== Fox&#x27;s Saturday morning programming ===
In January 2009, Fox became the first major broadcast network to carry a regularly scheduled block of paid programming when it discontinued its Saturday morning children&#x27;s programming after disputes with provider 4Kids Entertainment. Fox gave back three early hours to its affiliates, while retaining two hours for infomercials under the title &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot;.

Some local stations utilize Saturday morning slots to air local paid programming that typically sells used cars or real estate, and in other ways rejected infomercials, which were disdained by viewers and Fox affiliates alike: revenue was not shared with affiliates, and no local time for commercials between programs was offered. Some stations used Saturday morning for Educational/Informational (E/I) programming, with infomercials relegated to before or after the block. Some refused &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot; outright.

In September 2014, &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot; was replaced in some markets by the E/Ifocused &quot;Xploration Station&quot;.

== Peter Lemongello ==
In 1976, a singer from Long Island, New York named Peter Lemongello comprised an idea to buy commercial airtime on New York television to sell his album Love ‘76 directly to the public with a 2 minute infomercial. This was the first time an unknown singer marketed music directly to the consumer without a record label or marketing team. The stunt launched his career and sold over 1.8 million records, making him an instant celebrity. The music business took notice of the successful promotion and a new era of music videos and MTV followed. People like Slim Whitman and Time Life copied the idea of infomercials to sell their music.

== Criticism and legal issues ==
In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires that any infomercial 15 minutes or longer must disclose to viewers that it is a paid advertisement. An infomercial is required to be &quot;clearly and conspicuously&quot; marked as a &quot;paid advertisement for , sponsored by &quot; at the beginning (&quot;following program&quot;) and end (&quot;preceding program&quot;) of the advertisement and before ordering instructions are displayed.

Customer protection advocates recommend buyer beware: study the product and the claims before making a purchase. Many stations and networks normally run their own disclaimers before, during and/or after infomercials. Some mention the Better Business Bureau or a state/local customer protection agency. A &quot;paid programming&quot; bug in a corner of the screen during infomercials, particularly for financial products, is to avoid an exploitation of an &quot;as seen on&quot; claim of endorsement. Some, particularly smaller networks, only use a limited number of trusted advertisers.

Considerable FTC scrutiny is also given to results claims and testimonials. Rules controlling endorsements are periodically enhanced to increase customer protection and fill loopholes. Industry organizations such as the Electronic Retailing Association, which represents infomercial marketers, often try to minimize the impact of these rule changes. FTC enforcement has focused on testimonials for publishing &quot;non-typical&quot; and &quot;completely fabricated&quot; customer testimonials used within infomercials. In 2006, the first third-party testimonial verification company was launched, and it now independently pre-validates many testimonials.

Since the 1990s, federal and state customer protection agencies have criticized several prominent infomercial pitchmen, including Kevin Trudeau, Donald Barrett and, to a lesser extent, Matthew Lesko, and also Don Lapre, a salesman notorious for his get-rich-quick schemes. Some were successfully sued.

Programs that collect donations or sell via Premium-rate telephone number (900-number) have additional disclosure requirements.

=== As a putdown ===
In 1992, the &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine used the term &quot;infomercial&quot; to describe a cookbook whose author was described as &quot;hit No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; mediated.

Other possible putdowns include &quot;informercial-like&quot; and &quot;infomercial type stuff&quot;.

== Parodies ==
The infomercial format has been widely parodied:
* &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; &quot;Bassomatic&quot; skit featuring Dan Aykroyd in the 1970s may have presaged the genre; the target of the parody, Ron Popeil, would become an infomercial fixture in the 1980s and 1990s.
* &quot;Fast Company&quot; published &quot;The Greatest Infomercial Parodies Of All Time&quot; in 2011.

Others have been done too, and these parodies are an ongoing source of amusement and creativity.

The Adult Swim late-night block of cable channel Cartoon Network has often broadcast an anthology of comedy shorts in the early-morning hours, concealed in program schedules under the title &quot;Infomercials&quot; to provide a false impression that legitimate paid programming had been scheduled in that time slot. Some of these shorts have parodied the cliches of real infomercials, such as &quot;Paid Programming&quot; (a parody infomercial which begins as one for the fictitious supplement Icelandic UltraBlue, but seamlessly segues into segments promoting other loosely related products and businesses), , and &quot;Live Forever as You Are Now with Alan Resnick&quot; (which parodies self-help programs).

== Other uses and definitions ==

=== Political infomercials ===
In the United States, the strategy of buying prime-time programming slots on major networks has been utilized by political candidates for both presidential and state office to present infomercial-like programs to sell a candidate&#x27;s merits to the public. Fringe presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche regularly bought time on CBS and local stations in the 1980s. In the 1990s, Ross Perot also bought network time in 1992 and 1996 to present, his presidential policies to the public. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has aired programs via paid programming time to present their views on issues such as gun control and other issues while appealing to the public to join their organization.

=== Use during the 2008 presidential campaign ===
Hillary Clinton bought an hour of primetime programming on the Hallmark Channel in 2008 before the Super Tuesday primary elections, and on Texasbased regional sports network FSN Southwest before that state&#x27;s primary to present a town hall-like program. Fellow presidential candidate Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign used infomercials extensively, including running a 24-hour channel on Dish Network.

One week before the 2008 general election, Obama purchased a 30-minute slot at 8 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time during primetime on seven major networks (NBC, CBS, MSNBC, Fox, BET, TV One and Univision (with Spanish subtitles)) to present a &quot;closing argument&quot; to his campaign. The combination of these networks reportedly drew a peak audience of over 33 million viewers of the half-hour program, making it the single most watched infomercial broadcast in the history of U.S. television.
Aside from blocking viewer choice, reception was not all positive: an NBC reviewer referred to Obama as having a &quot;thin resume&quot;. Obama opponent John McCain commented that &quot;No one will delay the World Series with an infomercial when I&#x27;m president.&quot;

=== Children&#x27;s programming ===
Although not meeting the definition of an infomercial &quot;per se&quot;, animated children&#x27;s programming in the 1980s and early 1990s, which included half-hour animated series for franchises such as &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;, &quot;My Little Pony&quot;, and &quot;Transformers,&quot; were often described as being marketing vehicles for related toy lines and tie-in products advertised during commercial breaks. In the United States, the Children&#x27;s Television Act of 1990 set limits on the amount of commercials that could be aired during a television programming targeting children, and made it a violation of FCC regulations for broadcasters to carry commercials during children&#x27;s programs for products related to the program currently airing (which classifies the entire program as being a &quot;program-length commercial&quot;), or containing recognizable elements, such as characters, from the current program (&quot;hostselling&quot;).

=== Daytime programming ===

From the 1970s to early 1990s, locally produced morning and daytime programs designed mainly for a stay-at-home female audience featured light talk, followed by presentations of various products and services offerings of local businesses. A guest expert was often included. These were not infomercials: response was in-store, although the expert&#x27;s phone number might be included. The format enabled presenting details beyond those possible in a traditional 30-second pre-recorded ad. To preclude conflict of interest, the program host was not associated in any way with the station&#x27;s newsroom.

By the mid-2000s, these transitioned from locally produced programs to what is known as an advertorial. Some programs had one or more 120-second pods, but these programs were all paid programming. These programs can be considered infomercials, albeit not exactly meeting the letter of the definition. As with the early model, advertorial hosts are precluded from newsroom involvement, often to the point of having no IFB notice to guide viewers to a breaking news story that interrupts an advertorial program.

== Infomercial companies ==
Traditional infomercial marketers (for example, Guthy-Renker, Beachbody, and Telebrands) source the products, pay to develop the infomercials, pay for the media, and are responsible for all sales of the product. Sometimes, they sell products they source from inventors. Telebrands&#x27;s process of bringing a product to the air and to market was seen in the 2009 Discovery Channel series &quot;PitchMen&quot;, which featured Billy Mays and Anthony Sullivan, along with the top executives of Telebrands.

There is also a well-developed network of suppliers to the infomercial industry. These suppliers generally choose to focus on either traditional infomercials (hard sell approaches) or on using infomercials as advertising/sales channels for brand companies (branded approaches). In the traditional business, services are usually supplied by infomercial producers or by media buying companies. In the brand infomercial business, services are often provided by full service agencies who deliver strategy, creative, production, media, and campaign services.

== Use around the world ==

The infomercial industry was started in the United States and that has led to the specific definitions of infomercials as direct response television commercials of specific lengths (30, 60 or 120 seconds; five minutes;  minutes or 58 minutes and 30 seconds). Infomercials have spread to other countries from the U.S. However, the term &quot;infomercial&quot; needs to be defined more universally to discuss use in all countries. In general, worldwide use of the term refers to a television commercial (paid programming) that offers product for direct sale to persons via response through the web, by phone, or by mail.

There are few structures that apply everywhere in the international infomercial business. The regulatory environment in each country as well as that country&#x27;s television traditions have led to variations in format, lengths, and rules for long form commercials and television commercials selling directly to customers. For example, in the early 1990s, long form paid programming in Canada was required to consist only of photographs without moving video (this restriction no longer exists).

Many products which started in the United States have been taken into international distribution on television. In addition, each country has local entrepreneurs and marketers using the medium for local businesses. What may be called infomercials are most commonly found in North and South America, Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia.

In many countries, the infrastructure of direct response television distributors, telemarketing companies and product fulfillment companies (shipping, customer service) are more difficult and these missing pieces have limited the spread of the infomercial. Canadian &quot;Northern Response&quot;, an early nonUSA entrant to the field, claims to have distributed &quot;over 3,000 infomercials since 1984.&quot;

By 1996, countries with Teleshopping included France, Germany, UK, Japan, and Mexico.

== Research on effectiveness ==
Research has been conducted on the general public&#x27;s perceptions of infomercials. It was found that &quot;With infomercials, you don&#x27;t buy eyeballs, you buy responsiveness.&quot; Agee and Martin (2001) found that infomercial purchases involved some degree of planning rather than being purely impulse purchases. Aspects of advertising content also influenced whether the purchase decision was impulsive or planned. Martin, Bhimy and Agee (2002) studied the use of advertising content such as the use of testimonials and customer characteristics. Based on a survey of 878 people who had bought products after viewing infomercials, they found that infomercials were more effective if they used expert comments, testimonials, product demonstrations, and other approaches. Customer age and product type also influenced perceived effectiveness.

=== Time-slot effectiveness ===
Early research found that selecting the best time of day requires avoiding prime time, when &quot;there&#x27;s too much competition for viewers&#x27; attention.&quot;

=== Profitability ===
Profits from producing infomercials were described as not being &quot;the real profits&quot; when compared to &quot;owning the product.&quot;

<doc id="303045" wikidata="Q15052487" url="?curid=303045" title="Joy (Hunt novel)">
<text>Joy (1990) is a novel by Marsha Hunt about the relationship between two African-American women that is based on secrets, lies, and delusion. Mainly set in a posh New York apartment in the course of one day in the spring of 1987, the novel contains frequent flashbacks that describe life in a black neighbourhood in the 1950s and 1960s. The book also deals with stardom in the music business and some people&#x27;s inability, despite their riches, to make their own American Dream come true and to lead fulfilled lives.

==Plot summary==
The first person narrator of the novel is Palatine Ross, a 70-year-old cleaning woman originally from New Orleans, whose childhood is dominated by poverty and loss.

Shutting her eyes to all the evil in the world and firmly relying on God and the words of the Bible as guidance, Palatine tries to raise Joy and her sisters to be educated, honest and religious members of society. The fact that, growing up in a rough neighbourhood, the not-yet-teenaged girls are very early in their lives confronted with sex willingly escapes her notice. It troubles Palatine a great deal when Dagwood, her neighbour&#x27;s new boyfriend, starts spending the night with the girls&#x27; mother. One morning during the summer vacation, while his girlfriend is at work and Palatine is taking care of the children, Dagwood stays on in the apartment.

Right from the start, Palatine tries to take the three girls along to church, seeing that their blaspheming mother will never do so. Time and again, in the course of more than twenty years, Palatine tries to convince Joy that finding herself a nice coloured boyfriend whom she could marry and have children with would be the right thing to do. However, &quot;Chocolate Chip&quot; remains a one-hit wonder after an interview given by Brenda to some gay magazine in which she announces her coming out as a lesbian.

However, rather than being able to mourn Joy&#x27;s death, she for the first time learns things about Joy which finally force her to abandon her blinkered view of her &quot;God-sent child&quot; and admit that she was a sinner rather than a saint.

<text>Noah Falstein (born June 1957) is a game designer and producer who has been in the video game industry since 1980, winning &quot;Game of the Year&quot; titles for multiple games such as &quot;Battlehawks 1942&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&quot;. He has designed games for multiple platforms, including arcade video games, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS.

He was one of the first 10 employees at Lucasfilm Games, joining them in 1984; the third employee at DreamWorks Interactive in 1995; and also one of the early employees at The 3DO Company. He was the first elected chairperson of the International Game Developers Association, which he chaired from 1997 to 1998. He wrote the &quot;Better by Design&quot; column for &quot;Game Developer&quot; magazine from 2002–2007.

From 2013–2017 he was Chief Game Designer at Google. As of 2021 he works for the game consulting company The Inspiracy, which he founded in 1996.

==Early life==
Falstein was born and raised in Chicago, the youngest of three children to Wilbert Falstein, an advertising executive, and Kay Falstein, a nursery school teacher. He was designing toys at an early age, like taking wind-up toy cars and adding cardboard &quot;skins&quot; to them to turn them into boats or spaceships. He also loved to draw up blueprints of imaginative science fiction vehicles and spaceships, and found himself enjoying and designing his own boardgames, then iterating on his designs to make them more and more fun. He had his first exposure to computers at Rogers Elementary School in 1970, learning Fortran that was input on punch cards. Later, while at Mather High School there was some limited access to computers, but when he was 15 he was prompted by exposure to the early game by Nolan Bushnell, &quot;Computer Space&quot;, to seek out PLATO terminals at a nearby community college. He graduated high school in 1975, then attending Hampshire College, where he began programming his own games. At first they were text-only teletype games, and then he created a much larger senior product in APL: &quot;Koronis Strike: A Simulation of Mining and Combat in the Asteroid Belt&quot;, which featured realistic orbital mechanics and ran on the school&#x27;s first video terminal. In the game, the player fired at asteroids to learn their composition. He also intended to put in adversaries and combat, but ran out of time before he graduated. He did continue to use the name in one of his later projects though, when he designed &quot;Koronis Rift&quot; for LucasFilm Games.

==Career==
He received a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree from Hampshire College in 1980, and then one week after graduation he began work at the Milton Bradley Company&#x27;s Advanced Research division. This led to a job at Williams Electronics, where he co-designed the arcade game &quot;Sinistar&quot;. In 1984, he became one of the first 10 employees at LucasFilm Games, where he led brainstorming sessions with Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, and created games for the Commodore 64 such as &quot;Koronis Rift&quot; (1986), &quot;Battlehawks 1942&quot; (Action Game of the Year, 1992), &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&quot; (Adventure Game of the Year, 1992). In 1995, he became one of the first employees at &quot;Dreamworks Interactive&quot;, creating such games as &quot;Chaos Island&quot;.

In 1996, Falstein formed The Inspiracy, a consulting firm specializing in game design and production for clients on five continents, ranging from corporate training (Cisco, Microsoft) to medical education (Hopelab, Health Media Lab, Medical Cyberworlds) to entertainment (LucasArts, Disney, DreamCatcher, Micro Forte).

The Inspiracy also allowed Falstein to help with various game startups, and he was actively involved in the growing worldwide community of game developers. In 1997 he became the first elected chairperson of the International Game Developers Association, a position he held for one year. He has been on the advisory boards of the Games for Health Conference, the Serious Games Summit and Akili Interactive Labs.

In 2013 he put his consulting firm on hold when he was hired by Google as Chief Game Designer, a position he held for four years, and then he returned to consulting.

In 2002, Falstein and fellow LucasArts alum Hal Barwood began &quot;The 400 Project&quot;, an attempt to collect rules of computer game design under a standard format, with their prediction that it would be around 400 rules. This project continued for several years as they collated lists of rules on their respective websites, and gave followup talks at places such as the Game Developers Conference in San Jose, California. The project garnered considerable attention and is now regularly cited in academic articles.

As of 2021, Falstein is active in the development of the emerging market of serious games, most often Games for Health. One such game, &quot;EndeavorRx&quot;, by Akili Interactive Labs, is the first game to receive formal clearance from the FDA. Doctors can formally prescribe the playing of the game for children with pediatric ADHD.

==Public speaking==
Falstein has spoken at hundreds of venues around the world, from game conferences to universities to the Goddard Spaceflight Center. He was the keynote speaker in 2017 at the Øredev software developers conference in Sweden.

<doc id="303049" wikidata="Q2381805" url="?curid=303049" title="United States Sixth Fleet">
<text>The Sixth Fleet is a numbered fleet of the United States Navy operating as part of United States Naval Forces Europe and Africa. The Sixth Fleet is headquartered at Naval Support Activity Naples, Italy. The officially stated mission of the Sixth Fleet in 2011 is that it &quot;conducts the full range of Maritime Operations and Theater Security Cooperation missions, in concert with coalition, joint, interagency, and other parties, in order to advance security and stability in Europe and Africa.&quot; The current commander of the Sixth Fleet is Vice Admiral Jeffrey T. Anderson.

The Sixth Fleet was established in February 1950 by redesignation of the former Sixth Task Fleet, which in turn was the 1948 redesignation of U S Naval Forces, Mediterranean. Since that time, it has been continually engaged in world affairs around the Mediterranean, and, on occasion, further afield. It was involved in numerous NATO maritime exercises, the U.S. Lebanese intervention of 1958, confrontation with the Soviets during the Yom Kippur War (also known as the October War) of 1973, clearance of the Suez Canal after 1973, several confrontations with Libya during the 1980s (including Operation El Dorado Canyon), and maintenance of task forces in the Adriatic during the wars in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Most recently it launched airstrikes on Libya again during the Libyan Civil War of 2011.

==History==

The United States has maintained a naval presence in the Mediterranean since the early 19th century, when U.S. Naval forces first engaged the Barbary pirates to prevent them from interfering with commercial shipping. The earliest unit was the Mediterranean Squadron.

On 1 February 1946, U.S. Naval Forces, Northwest African Waters (NavNAW), was redesignated U.S. Naval Forces, Mediterranean. The force was responsible to U.S. Naval Forces, Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean in London, and had as its flagship a destroyer tender, anchored at Naples, Italy. In 1946, President Truman dispatched the battleship to the Eastern Mediterranean, ostensibly to return the body of Münir Ertegün, former Turkish Ambassador to Washington, back to Istanbul. However, perhaps a much stronger motive was to demonstrate U.S. power in view of Soviet threats to Turkey and Iran. The cruiser relieved the tender as flagship and began operating with the fleet. In June 1946 , flying the flag of Vice Admiral Bernhard Bieri, Commander, Naval Forces Mediterranean, was despatched to Trieste.

On 5 September 1946, , flying the flag of Rear Admiral John H. Cassady, Commander Carrier Division 1, and accompanied by , , and , visited Piraeus, the port of Athens. , escorted by USS &quot;Fargo&quot; and , visited Greece in December 1946.

The title of Naval Forces Mediterranean was changed to Commander Sixth Task Fleet and then, in 1950, Commander, Sixth Fleet. Sixth Fleet&#x27;s NATO guise was the principal player in Exercise Longstep during November 1952. In 1957, a naval exercise, Operation Deep Water, took place within the Allied Forces Southern Europe area of responsibility. It was conducted by Naval Striking and Support Forces Southern Europe (STRIKFORSOUTH), commanded by Vice Admiral Charles R. Brown USN, who also commanded the Sixth Fleet. STRIKEFORSOUTH was effectively the NATO designation for the U.S. Sixth Fleet, though additional NATO headquarters personnel would eventually be assigned, while maintaining American control over its nuclear weapons on board U.S. aircraft carriers as mandated by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946.

Sixth Fleet supported American land forces during Operation Blue Bat in Lebanon in 1958.

On 20 January 1967, following France&#x27;s withdrawal from the NATO Military Command Structure, and the removal of NATO troops from France, Sixth Fleet Headquarters was moved from Villefranche-sur-Mer, France to Gaeta, Italy.

During the Cold War, the Sixth Fleet had several confrontations with the Soviet Navy&#x27;s 5th Operational Squadron, notably during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. During the Yom Kippur War Elmo Zumwalt describes part of the Sixth Fleet buildup as follows:

On 25 October JCS directed TG 20.1, and escorts, to [come under the command of]… ComSixthFleet as TG 60.3 and proceed to join TG 60 south of Crete. Additionally, and escorts (TG 60.2) and TF61/62 [the amphibious task forces] were directed to join TG 60.1 south of Crete. …TG 100.1 (Baltic destroyers) were ordered to proceed to the Mediterranean and chop to ComSixthFleet…
5 April 1974, the United States and Egypt agreed that the United States would provide extensive assistance to clear the Suez Canal of mines, unexploded ordnance, and sunken ships. These operations took the form of Nimbus Star (mine and ordnance clearance), Nimbus Moon (land and sub-surface naval ordnance clearance), and Nimrod Spar, in which a private salvage contractor would clear the canal of the ten sunken ships under the supervision of the Sixth Fleet&#x27;s Task Force 65. Captain J. Huntly Boyd, the Navy&#x27;s Supervisor of Salvage, was sent to the Canal Zone as Commander, Salvage Task Group (CTG 65.7). He supervised the actual salvage clearing operation which was carried out by the Murphy Pacific Marine Salvage Company of New York. A total of ten ships blocked the canal; 200 civilian specialists worked from May to December 1974 to complete the operation. The canal reopened on 5 June 1975, with the Sixth Fleet flagship &quot;Little Rock&quot; in attendance.

On the afternoon of 8 June 1967, while in international waters off the northern coast of the Sinai Peninsula, technical research ship USS &quot;Liberty&quot; was attacked and damaged by the Israel Defense Forces; 34 American sailors were killed and 174 wounded by the Israeli attack. Though &quot;Liberty&quot; was severely damaged, with a 39-by-24-foot (11.9 m × 7.3 m) hole amidships and a twisted keel, her crew kept her afloat, and she was able to leave the area under her own power. After the attack, she was escorted to Valletta, Malta, by units of the Sixth Fleet and was given temporary repairs. After the repairs were completed, &quot;Liberty&quot; returned to the United States on 27 July 1967. She was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 June 1968. She was laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet of Norfolk until December 1970, when she was transferred to the Maritime Administration for disposal. In 1973, she was sold for scrapping to the Boston Metals Company of Baltimore, Maryland.

In 1999, changes to CINCUSNAVEUR&#x27;s area of responsibility were announced, after amendments to the Unified Command Plan. The United States Atlantic Command areas that had included the waters off Europe and the west coast of Africa were to be transferred to European Command. U.S. European Command already had responsibility for all U.S. land and air military planning in Europe and most of Africa. The change gave EUCOM, and NAVEUR, the responsibility for maritime planning in the same general area of operations. The changes were made effective on October 1, 2000. The Atlantic Command areas that presently include the waters off Europe and the west coast of Africa were also transferred to European Command. This change also extended Sixth Fleet&#x27;s responsibilities to the mid-Atlantic.

The Sixth Fleet provided military, logistical and humanitarian assistance to support NATO operations in Kosovo from the beginning of Operation Allied Force. It also participated in Operation Shining Hope and Operation Joint Guardian. In March 2011, it was involved in operations in Libya pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973.

==Structure==
The fleet once had its headquarters in Gaeta, Italy, commanded by a Vice Admiral. However, beginning in 2004, the Sixth Fleet staff was combined with United States Naval Forces Europe staff, up to that time headquartered in London. Since then the staff has operated as a single entity with a four star admiral who serves as Commander, Naval Forces Europe and Commander, Naval Forces Africa. This admiral has a three star Deputy Commander who also carries the title Commander, U.S. 6th Fleet. The staff as a whole is known as Commander, Naval Forces Europe-Africa/Commander, U.S. 6th Fleet or CNE-CNA/C6F and works from its facilities at Naval Support Activity Naples at the Capodichino site in Naples, Italy. is the Sixth Fleet flagship with its homeport Gaeta, Italy and operating in the Mediterranean.

U.S. Naval forces entering the Mediterranean Sea have their operational control changed to being under Sixth Fleet. This change of command is always referred to as &#x27;CHOPing,&#x27; an abbreviation for Change of Operational Control. Sixth Fleet has consisted of up to 40 ships, 175 aircraft and 21,000 people, such as in early 2003, when two carrier battle groups operated in the Mediterranean during Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Since the submarine tender , based in La Maddalena in Sardinia, changed homeports to Bremerton, Washington, the fleet has just one permanently assigned ship, &quot;Mount Whitney&quot;. The fleet typically has a number of frigates and destroyers assigned, as well as those vessels transiting between the East Coast and the Suez. Since 2005, Sixth Fleet ships have increasingly been operating around Africa, particularly in the Gulf of Guinea.

The Sixth Fleet is operationally organized into task forces. Naval Striking and Support Forces Southern Europe included Task Force 502 (Carrier Forces, effectively Task Force 60), Task Force 503 (Amphibious Forces), Task Force 504 (Landing Forces), Task Force 505 (Logistics Forces), and Task Force 506 (Special Operations Forces).

===Destroyer squadron 60===
Destroyer Squadron 60 (DESRON SIX ZERO) was established on 19 February 2003. It was homeported in Gaeta, Italy. The establishment of Destroyer Squadron Sixty provided CNE/COMSIXTHFLT with a permanently assigned destroyer squadron, increasing the Sixth Fleet&#x27;s options when undertaking national and theater level tasking.

From November 2007 to April 2008, COMDESRON 60 (Commander, Destroyer Squadron 60&#x27;s commander) served as Commander Africa Partnership Station with an international staff operating off West Africa and the Gulf of Guinea.

He also serves as Commander, Task Force 365, Task Force West and Central Africa.

===Task Force 60===
Task Force 60 was for many years the Sixth Fleet&#x27;s Battle Force. When any carrier strike group enters into the Mediterranean operating area it is usually designated TF 60 and the battle group commander, a one or two-star flag officer, assumes duties as Commander Task Force 60 (CTF 60) from COMDESRON 60. The Task Force is often composed of one or more aircraft carriers, each with an accompanying complement of two to six cruisers and destroyers. On board the aircraft carrier is a Carrier air wing of 65–85 aircraft. This air wing is the primary striking arm of the Strike Group, and includes attack, fighter, anti-submarine, and reconnaissance aircraft.

During the 1986 confrontation with Libya, that led to Operation El Dorado Canyon, the Sixth Fleet&#x27;s battle force was under the command of Rear Admiral David E. Jeremiah. Task Group 60.1 under Rear Admiral J.C. Breast was made up of the &quot;Coral Sea&quot; and her escorts, Task Group 60.2 under Jeremiah, &quot;Saratoga&quot; and her escorts, and Task Group 60.3 under Rear Admiral Henry H. Mauz, Jr., &quot;America&quot; and her escorts. Task Group 60.5, the Surface Action Group under Captain Robert L. Goodwin, was made up of a missile cruiser, missile destroyer, and another destroyer.

In November 2007, Task Group 60.4 held the Africa Partnership Station role, embarked aboard the amphibious ship . HSV &quot;Swift&quot; was scheduled to join &quot;Fort McHenry&quot; in Africa in November 2007. In 2012, Task Group 60.5 was permanently assigned as the Southeast Africa Task Group. The Group may be renamed the South and East Africa Task Group. It held the alternate designation of Task Force 363.

 Task Force 60 will normally be the commander of Naval Task Force Europe and Africa. Any naval unit within the USEUCOM or USAFRICOM AOR may be assigned to TF 60 as required upon signal from the Commander of the Sixth Fleet.

===Task Force 61, amphibious assault force===
Task Force 61 was the Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group. It is composed of approximately three amphibious ships and their embarked landing craft. From these ships, United States Marine amphibious forces can move ashore by sea and air in amphibious assault or emergency evacuation missions. Once ashore, the ships of Task Force 61 logistically support the ground forces, until the objective of the landing has been accomplished, and the Marine Forces return to the ships.

, according to official NavEur/NavAf Public Affairs sources, Task Force 61 will normally be the commander of the deployed carrier strike group (CSG) and will exercise operational control of all units assigned to TF61 operating in the USEUCOM or USAFRICOM AOR.

===Task Force 62, landing force (Marine expeditionary unit)===
Task Force 62 is the combat-ready ground force composed of a Marine expeditionary unit (MEU) of approximately 1,900 Marines. Transported in Task Force 61 ships, the MEU is equipped with armor, artillery, and transport helicopters that enable it to conduct operations ashore, or evacuate civilians from troubled areas. This MEU is usually from II MEF on the East Coast.

, according to official Public Affairs sources, Task Force 62 will normally be the commander of the deployed Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) and will exercise operational control of all units assigned to TF61 operating in the USEUCOM or USAFRICOM AOR.

===Task Force 63 logistics force===
Task Force 63 is the Logistics Force. Task Force 63 and Military Sealift Command&#x27;s Sealift Logistics Command (SEALOGEUR) are two separately named formations that actually operate as a unified one with one staff. Task Force 63 is headquartered at Naples, Italy. Composed of oilers, provision ships, and repair ships, its mission is the delivery of supplies at sea, and effecting repairs to other ships and equipment of the Fleet. Commander, Task Force 63 (CTF-63) is the operational commander of all the U.S. 6th Fleet air and sea logistics. While in theater, Military Sealift Command&#x27;s Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force and Special Mission ships report to CTF-63 along with cargo planes that support 6th Fleet and U.S. European Command logistics missions.

CTF-63 is also responsible for ordering and tracking spare parts and supplies being delivered to ships in theater. CTF-63 is the immediate operational commander of Maritime Prepositioning ship Squadron One (MPSRON ONE) based in the Mediterranean Sea. The ships of MPSRON One are deployed year-round. This pre-positions U.S. military cargo at sea. Should a military or humanitarian crisis arise in theater, the squadron can deliver its cargo ashore, enabling a faster U.S. response.

===Task Force 64 Integrated Air and Missile Defense Force===
The first incarnation of Task Force 64 consisted of nuclear-powered submarines armed with long-range strategic missiles (SSBN). Until the end of the 1970s these ships were homeported in Naval Station Rota, Spain. The mission was nuclear deterrence. It is extremely unlikely that any SSBNs are actually still assigned or operate with CNE/C6F in the Mediterranean.

Previously, CTF 64 was responsible for ballistic missile submarines assigned to the Sixth Fleet. CTF 64&#x27;s administrative title, was Commander Submarine Group 8. ComSubGru 8&#x27;s operational functions were accomplished through four Task Forces: CTF 64, CTF 69 (attack submarines), NATO&#x27;s CTF 442, or deployed SSBNs and CTF 439, the operational title for Commander Submarines Allied Naval Forces South—the rear admiral&#x27;s NATO hat. (globalsecurity.org)

TF 64 then became a Special Operation force, previously headquartered by the now-disbanded Naval Special Warfare Unit 10 at Rota, Spain. NSWU 10 disbanded in 2005, and it is now unclear whether CTF 64 is operating currently. During the initial stages of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, Task Force 64 became the administrative command structure created to interface with all non-UK/US special forces and smaller ground combat forces provided by various national governments and under American operational control. This may have been because NSWU 10 elements deployed to Afghanistan to form part of the HQ.

On 24 March 2016 TF64 assumed control of 6th Fleet&#x27;s missile defense mission.

===Task Force 65===

April 1967 saw the threat of civil war in Greece commencing with the military coup that ended parliamentary rule there. Although King Constantine II of Greece held his throne, the possibility of violence in the streets of Athens loomed as a potential threat to the American citizens suddenly caught up in the turmoil. It seemed that evacuation by ship might be necessary and the Sixth Fleet commander ordered the formation of a special operations task force. Under the command of Rear Admiral Dick H. Guinn, Task Force 65, with &quot;America&quot; as flagship, sailed eastward to stand by for evacuation, should that step be necessary. Violence never materialized in Greece, and the task force was not called upon to act. On 29 April, Rear Admiral Lawrence R. Geis relieved Rear Admiral Guinn as Commander, Carrier Division 4, Commander, TF 60, Commander, TF 65, and Commander, TF 502 (NATO). With a new admiral on board, and the Greek political crisis behind her, &quot;America&quot; sailed into Taranto Harbor, Italy, on the first day of May for eight days of relaxation. During three days of general visiting in Taranto, &quot;America&quot; hosted 1,675 visitors who came aboard to tour the hangar and flight decks. &quot;America&quot; departed Taranto on 8 May for routine task group operations in the Ionian and Tyrrhenian Seas, she followed these with a port visit to Livorno.

Rear Admiral Brian McCauley served as Commander Task Force 65 during the Suez Canal clearance operations, from April 1974 to June 1975.

Task Force 65/Destroyer Squadron 60 located in Rota, Spain. Commander, Task Force 65/Commander Destroyer Squadron SIX ZERO exercises operational and tactical control of all forward deployed surface combatants operating in the USEUCOM and USAFRICOM AORs under the direction of Naval Forces Europe/Africa. TF 65 surface combatants execute myriad operations from as far north as the Norwegian Sea and south to the Cape of Good Hope including Ballistic Missile Defense, Sea Lines of Communication enforcement, Maritime Interdiction Operations, direct support to NATO combined and Joint operations and exercises, Counter-terrorism operations, Counter-piracy operations, Africa Maritime Law Enforcement Partnership operations, whole of government Africa Partnership Station deployments and Theater Security Cooperation activities both in port and underway.

It can be seen from this 2011 official description that the CDS 60 task force designator has been switched from TF 60 to TF 65.
In November 2007, the destroyer &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot; circumnavigated the African continent while performing theater security operations with local military forces as the flagship of Task Group 60.5, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Southeast Africa task force.

===Task Force 66 All-Domain innovation, development and asymmetric capabilities===
Established in 2024, Task Force 66 headquartered in Naples, Italy, leverages collaboration between the government, industry and academia – including pairing operational tacticians with international experts to accelerate development and fielding of new systems at scale:

* Unmanned – integrate all-domain unmanned systems (UxS) across the joint force, Coalition, Allies, and partner nations.
* Maritime Domain Awareness – support multinational efforts to address transnational issues like illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUUx) activities.
* All-Domain – drive operations to integrate capabilities across information, space, cyber, sea, air, and land domains enabled by UxS.

The Task Force works closely with the Navy Disruptive Capabilities Office (DCO) on rapid experimentation and prototyping. It will also work with Naval Postgraduate School&#x27;s Naval Innovation Center (NIC) established by SECNAV on ways to accelerate technology solutions and applications. To this end, Task Force 66 is responsible for the logistical lines of effort of 6th Fleet&#x27;s autonomous unmanned systems throughout the AOR with joint force, Coalition, Allies, and partner nations in support of these activities.

===Task Force 67 land-based maritime patrol aircraft===
Task Force 67 is composed of land-based maritime patrol aircraft. These aircraft operate over the waters of the Mediterranean in anti-submarine, reconnaissance, surveillance, and mining roles.
In the past, Task Force 67&#x27;s has been provided by Commander, Fleet Air Mediterranean (COMFLTAIRMED), but it is unclear whether FLTAIRMED still exists. The Task Force commander also previously held the role of NATO AFSOUTH&#x27;s Commander, Maritime Air, Allied Naval Forces South with the NATO task force designator TF 431.

Task Force organization 2022:

CTF-67 commands all Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft (MPRA) in the European and African theaters.
*TG-67.1 Sigonella, Sicily, VP-Patrol Squadron (P-8A)
*TG-67.2 Sigonella, Sicily, Tactical Operation Center (TOC)
**TU-67.2.1 Sigonella, Sicily, Mobile Tactical Operation Center (MTOC)
**TU-67.2.2 Keflavik, Iceland, Mobile Tactical Operation Center (MTOC)
*TG-67.3 Sigonella, Sicily, Triton UAV (MQ-4)(When Activated)
*TG-67.4 Souda Bay, Greece, VQ-Squadron (EP-3)
*TG-67.5 Spangalem, Germany, VAQ-Squadron (EA-18G)
*TG-67.6 Sigonella, Italy, HSC-Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (MH-60S)
*TG-67.7 Rota, Spain, HSM-Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron (MH-60R)
*TG-67.8 Keflavik, Iceland, VP-Patrol Squadron (P-8A)

, officially Task Force 67&#x27;s mission is to provide responsive, interoperable, and expeditionary combat ready maritime patrol aircraft and supporting forces to Commander, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe/Commander, U.S. Naval Forces, Africa
and Commander, U.S. Sixth Fleet (CNE-CNA-C6F), NATO and Unified Commanders to conduct effective Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), maintain Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), enhance regional stability, promote cooperative maritime safety and security, and be decisive while conducting overseas contingency operations.

At some point between 1999 and 2012, probably after 11 September 2001, TG-67.6 was activated in Djibouti. This is within the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) area of operations; before the changeover of responsibility for the Horn of Africa from United States Central Command to AFRICOM, this task group was a component of the United States Fifth Fleet&#x27;s Task Force 57.

===Task Force 68, maritime force protection force===
Established 17 March 2005, CTF 68 is to command force protection forces such as construction battalions, mobile mine assembly units, and Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Teams (FAST) platoons which are part of Marine Corps Security Force Company Europe (MCSFCoEUR).

Task Force 68 is the Navy Expeditionary Combat Force. Units typically assigned to TF 68 are Explosive Ordnance Disposal units, Naval Construction units and Marines which make up the Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Teams (FAST).

A possibly more recent mission for CTF 68 is Commander, Task Force SIX EIGHT conducts Explosive Ordnance Disposal operations, Naval Construction, Expeditionary Security and Theater Security Cooperation in order to maintain strategic assess, develop interoperability with coalition, joint, inter-agency and other partners, and increase security and stability in Europe and Africa. On order, conduct Point and Area Defense to protect and defend critical infrastructure and High Value Assets against terrorist attack. Be prepared to conduct Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations.

===Task Force 69 submarine warfare===
Task Force 69 is responsible for planning and coordinating area submarine and anti-submarine warfare operations in the Mediterranean. Specifically, Task Force 69 is composed of attack submarines that provide capability to destroy enemy surface ships and submarines, as well as protect other Sixth Fleet ships from attack.

, according to official U.S. Navy public affairs contributions to Wikipedia, Task Force 69 is the Submarine Force and exercises operational control of all Submarine assets in the USEUCOM or USAFRICOM AOR.

<doc id="303050" wikidata="Q120342" url="?curid=303050" title="Michelle Hunziker">
<text>Michelle Yvonne Hunziker (, ; born 24 January 1977) is a Swiss and Italian television presenter and former model.

She will co-host the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2025 in Basel, Switzerland alongside Hazel Brugger and Sandra Studer.

==Early life==
Hunziker was born in Sorengo, Lugano, in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland. Her mother Ineke is Dutch, with distant Indonesian ancestry, and her father Rudolf, who died of a heart attack in 2001, was a German-speaking Swiss painter who worked as a hotel manager. In 1983, the family moved to Ostermundigen, a suburb of Bern in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, where Hunziker attended elementary school. After moving to Milan, Italy, with her mother, she became a fashion model and was hired by Riccardo Gay, an agent. At 17 she posed for Armani, Rocco Barocco, La Perla, Colmar, Fuerte Ventura, Lovable and Swish.

==Career==
As she was Eros Ramazzotti&#x27;s fiancée, Hunziker was discovered by an Italian TV producer. In 1996, she presented the Rai Uno-show &quot;I cervelloni&quot; with Paolo Bonolis. In summer, she presented the prime time comedy show &quot;Paperissima Sprint&quot; (Canale 5) with Gabibbo. Because of her popularity, she hosted the afternoon show &quot;Colpo di Fulmine&quot; (Italia 1) in 1997. She attended the professional academy &quot;Music Art &amp; Show&quot; in Milan with her choreographer Susanna Beltrami.

In 1998, the Italian film director Vincenzo Verdecchi offered Hunziker her first film role in the TV series &quot;La Forza dell&#x27;Amore&quot; (Canale 5). Afterwards she took the leading female role in &quot;Fammi stare sotto al letto&quot;. She was also in the documentary &quot;The Protagonist&quot; and in another film, &quot;Alex l&#x27;Ariete&quot;, where she acted with ex-skiing star Alberto Tomba. Hunziker and Pippo Baudo hosted the Canale 5 show &quot;La festa del Disco&quot;. From 1999 to 2001, she presented the late-night show &quot;Nonsolomoda&quot; (Canale 5) where she reported about fashion and lifestyle.

In 1999, TV3, the first Swiss private television station, was founded in Zürich, and Hunziker hosted a show called &quot;Cinderella&quot;, where a hair and make-up artist, as well as a styling adviser, helped both a celebrity and a viewer have a makeover. After the first episode, Hunziker was caught in the crossfire. The Swiss newspaper Blick even wrote: &quot;Cinderella, TV3&#x27;s new lifestyle show is not bad. It is catastrophic&quot;. Later, Hunziker was interviewed by the Swiss-German magazine Schweizer Illustrierte and said that she could not speak German anymore after having lived in Italy for many years. After TV3 had changed the concept, the show became more popular.

After hosting the Swiss show &quot;Cinderella&quot;, Hunziker was discovered by German TV producers. In 1998, she presented the Goldene Kamera awards show with Thomas Gottschalk (a very well-known presenter in Germany). A year later, she co-hosted the show &quot;Michael Jackson &amp; Friends&quot; (ZDF) in Munich. After she had been on various talk shows, she presented her first in Germany: &quot;Erstes Glück&quot; (SWR/Das Erste). She co-hosted the show with Thomas Elstner and interviewed celebrities about their first love. The show was not very popular though and ultimately axed. 
When she returned to Italy, she presented the shows &quot;Donna sotto le stelle&quot; and &quot;Piazza di Spagna&quot; (Canale 5) with Gerry Scotti and &quot;Tacchi a spillo&quot; (Italia 1) with Claudio Lippi. In 2002–2004, Hunziker and Carsten Spengemann presented the first and second season of &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot;, the German version of the British TV show &quot;Pop Idol&quot;.

Hunziker joined ZDF&#x27;s &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;, Germany&#x27;s most popular TV show in October 2009. The show was also syndicated live on the Austrian ORF and SF1 in her native Switzerland.

In 2006, she released an album in English, &quot;Lole&quot;, that was available only in German-speaking countries; the only single off the album was &quot;From Noon Till Midnight&quot;.

Hunziker co-hosted the Italian comedy shows &quot;Zelig&quot; (Italia 1) and &quot;Scherzi a parte&quot; (Canale 5) in 2001. &quot;Zelig&quot; is one of the most famous Italian TV shows. Later that year, she received the Italian TV Oscar in the category &quot;Discovery of the Year&quot;. She also co-hosted the Italian open-air music show &quot;Festivalbar&quot; with Daniele Bossari and Alessia Marcuzzi.

She has also starred in the musicals directed by Saverio Marconi &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (playing the role of Maria von Trapp) and &quot;Cabaret&quot; (playing the role of Sally Bowles); both had huge success in Italy.

In 2007, Hunziker and Pippo Baudo hosted the Italian song contest, the Festival di Sanremo, on Rai Uno. Later, she co-hosted &quot;Striscia la notizia&quot; again with Ezio Greggio and &quot;Paperissima&quot; with Gerry Scotti.

In 2018, she hosted the Sanremo Music Festival on Rai 1 with Claudio Baglioni and Pierfrancesco Favino In 2020, she appeared in a video posted by Mimmo Modem, with the renowned neomelodic song by Niko Pandetta, Marco Calone and Pino Franzese called &quot;Danza&quot;.

In May 2025, she will co-host the final of the Eurovision Song Contest in Basel, alongside Hazel Brugger and Sandra Studer.

==Personal life==

Hunziker was married to Italian singer Eros Ramazzotti from 1998. They separated in 2002 and divorced in 2009. She acquired Italian citizenship through this marriage. The marriage produced a daughter.

Hunziker announced her engagement to the Trussardi-heir Tomaso Trussardi in 2013. The couple have two daughters together.

In 2017, Hunziker announced that she blamed a cult for her divorce from Ramazzotti. She said that the cult tried to persuade her that he was a bad influence on her and to isolate her from her family. This statement caused an outcry in Italy.

<doc id="303051" wikidata="Q500394" url="?curid=303051" title="Gallo-Romance languages">
<text>The Gallo-Romance branch of the Romance languages includes in the narrowest sense the &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; and Franco-Provençal. However, other definitions are far broader and variously encompass the Occitan or Occitano-Romance, Gallo-Italic or Rhaeto-Romance languages.

Old Gallo-Romance was one of the two languages in which the Oaths of Strasbourg were written in 842 AD.

== Classification ==

The Gallo-Romance group includes:
* The &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; include French, Orleanais, Gallo, Angevin, Tourangeau, Saintongeais, Poitevin, Bourguignon, Picard, Walloon, Lorrain and Norman.
* Franco-Provençal in east-central France, western Switzerland and the Aosta Valley region of northwestern Italy. Formerly thought of as a dialect of either the langue d&#x27;oïl or Occitan, it is linguistically a language on its own or rather a separate group of languages, as many of its dialects have little mutual intelligibility. It shares features with both French and Occitan.

Other language families often included in Gallo-Romance:

* Occitano-Romance, including languages and dialects such as Catalan, Occitan, and Aragonese.
* Rhaeto-Romance, including Romansh of Switzerland, Ladin of the Dolomites area and Friulian of Friuli. Rhaeto-Romance can be classified as either Gallo-Romance or a separate branch within the Western Romance languages. Rhaeto-Romance is a diverse group, with the Italian varieties influenced by Venetian and Italian and Romansh by Franco-Provençal.
* Gallo-Italic, including Piedmontese, Ligurian, Lombard, Emilian, Romagnol, Judeo-Italian, Gallo-Italic of Sicily and Gallo-Italic of Basilicata. Venetian is also part of the Gallo-Italic branch according both to Ethnologue and Glottolog. Gallo-Italic can be classified as either Gallo-Romance or a separate branch of the Western Romance languages. Ligurian and Venetian, if it is considered in the category, retain the final -o and are the exceptions in Gallo-Romance.
* In addition, there are several French-based creole languages such as Haitian Creole.

In the view of some linguists (Pierre Bec, Andreas Schorta, Heinrich Schmid, Geoffrey Hull), Rhaeto-Romance and Gallo-Italic form a single linguistic unity named &quot;Rhaeto-Cisalpine&quot; or &quot;Padanian&quot;, which includes also the Venetian and Istriot languages, whose Italianate features are deemed to be superficial and secondary in nature.

== Traditional geographical extension ==

How far the Gallo-Romance languages spread varies a great deal depending on which languages are included in the group. Those included in its narrowest definition (the langues d&#x27;oïl and Arpitan) were historically spoken in the northern half of France, including parts of Flanders, Alsace and part of Lorraine; the Wallonia region of Belgium; the Channel Islands; parts of Switzerland; and Northern Italy.

Today, a single Gallo-Romance language (French) dominates much of the geographic region (including the formerly-non-Romance areas of France) and has also spread overseas.

At its broadest, the area also encompasses Southern France; Catalonia, the Valencian Community, and the Balearic islands in eastern Spain; Andorra; and much of Northern Italy.

== General characteristics ==

The Gallo-Romance languages are generally considered the most innovative (least conservative) among the Romance languages. Northern France, the medieval area of the langue d&#x27;oïl from which modern French developed, was the epicentre. Characteristic Gallo-Romance features generally developed the earliest, appear in their most extreme manifestation in the langue d&#x27;oïl and gradually spread out from there along riverways and roads. The earliest vernacular Romance writing occurred in Northern France, as the development of vernacular writing in a given area was forced by the almost total inability of Romance speakers to understand Classical Latin, which was still the vehicle of writing and culture.

Gallo-Romance languages are usually characterised by the loss of all unstressed final vowels other than (most significantly, final and were lost). However, when the loss of a final vowel would result in an impossible final cluster (e.g. ), an epenthetic vowel appears in place of the lost vowel, usually . Generally, the same changes also occurred in final syllables closed by a consonant. Franco-Provençal, however, generally preserves the original final vowel after a syllable-final cluster, such as &quot;quattuor&quot; &quot;four&quot; &gt; &quot;quatro&quot; (compare French &quot;quatre&quot;).

Furthermore, loss of in a final syllable was early enough in Primitive Old French that the Classical Latin third-person singular was often preserved: &quot;venit&quot; &quot;he comes&quot; &gt; (Romance vowel changes) &gt; (diphthongization) &gt; (lenition) &gt; (Gallo-Romance final vowel loss) &gt; (final devoicing). Elsewhere, final vowel loss occurred later, or unprotected was lost earlier (perhaps under Italian influence).

Other than southern Occitano-Romance, the Gallo-Romance languages are quite innovative, with French and some of the Gallo-Italian languages rivalling each other for the most extreme phonological changes compared with more conservative languages. For example, French &quot;sain, saint, sein, ceint, seing&quot; meaning &quot;healthy, holy, breast, (he) girds, signature&quot; (Latin &quot;sānum&quot;, &quot;sanctum&quot;, &quot;sinum&quot;, &quot;cingit&quot;, &quot;signum&quot;) are all pronounced .

In other ways, however, the Gallo-Romance languages are conservative. The older stages of many of the languages are famous for preserving a two-case system, consisting of nominative and oblique cases, which was fully marked on nouns, adjectives and determiners; was inherited almost directly from the Latin nominative and accusative cases; and preserved a number of different declensional classes and irregular forms.

In the opposite of the normal pattern, the languages closest to the oïl epicentre preserve the case system the best, and languages at the periphery (near languages that had long before lost the case system except for pronouns) lost it early. For example, the case system was preserved in Old Occitan until around the 13th century but had already been lost in Old Catalan although there were very few other differences between them.

The Occitan group is known for an innovatory ending on many subjunctive and preterite verbs and an unusual development of (Latin intervocalic -d-), which, in many varieties, merged with (from intervocalic palatalised -c- and -ty-).

The following tables show two examples of the extensive phonological changes that French has undergone. (Compare modern Italian &quot;saputo&quot;, &quot;vita&quot;, which are even more conservative than the reconstructed Western Romance forms.)


These are the notable characteristics of the Gallo-Romance languages:
* Early loss of all final vowels other than is the defining characteristic, as was noted above.
* Further reductions of final vowels in langue d&#x27;oïl and many Gallo-Italic languages, with the feminine and epenthetic vowel merging into , which was often subsequently dropped.
* Early heavy reduction of unstressed vowels in the interior of a word, which is another defining characteristic. It and final vowel reduction are most of the extreme phonemic differences between the Northern and the Central Italian dialects, which otherwise share a great deal of vocabulary and syntax.
* Loss of the final vowels phonemicised the long vowels, which had been automatic concomitants of stressed open syllables. The phonemic long vowels are maintained directly in many Northern Italian dialects. Elsewhere, phonemic length was lost, but many of the long vowels had been diphthongised, which resulted in the maintenance of the original distinction. The langue d&#x27;oïl branch was again at the forefront of innovation, with at least five of the seven long vowels diphthongising (only high vowels were spared).
* Front rounded vowels are present in all branches except Catalan. usually fronts to (typically along with a shift of to ), and mid-front rounded vowels often develop from long or .
* Extreme and repeated lenition occurs in many languages, especially in langue d&#x27;oïl and many Gallo-Italian languages. Examples from French: &quot;ˈvītam&quot; &gt; &quot;vie&quot; &quot;life&quot;; *&quot;saˈpūtum&quot; &gt; &quot;su&quot; &quot;known&quot;; similarly &quot;vu&quot; &quot;seen&quot; &lt; *&quot;vidūtum&quot;, &quot;pu&quot; &quot;been able&quot; &lt; *&quot;potūtum&quot;, &quot;eu&quot; &quot;had&quot; &lt; *&quot;habūtum&quot;. Examples from Lombard: *&quot;căsa&quot; &gt; &quot;cà&quot; &quot;home, house&quot;
* Most langue d&#x27;oïl dialects (except Norman and Picard) and Swiss Rhaeto-Romance languages and many northern Occitan dialects have a secondary palatalization of and before , with different results because of the primary Romance palatalisation: &quot;centum&quot; &quot;hundred&quot; &gt; &quot;cent&quot; , &quot;cantum&quot; &quot;song&quot; &gt; &quot;chant&quot; .
* Other than Occitano-Romance languages, most Gallo-Romance languages are subject-obligatory, but all other Romance languages are pro-drop languages. That is a late development triggered by progressive phonetic erosion. Old French was still a null-subject language until the loss of secondary final consonants in Middle French caused verb forms (e.g. &quot;aime&quot;/&quot;aimes&quot;/&quot;aiment&quot;; &quot;viens&quot;/&quot;vient&quot;) to be pronounced the same.

Gallo-Italian languages have a number of features in common with the other Italian languages:
* Loss of final , which triggers raising of the preceding vowel (more properly, the &quot;debuccalises&quot; to , which is monophthongised into a higher vowel): &gt; , &gt; , hence Standard Italian plural &quot;cani&quot; &lt; &quot;canes&quot;, subjunctive &quot;tu canti&quot; &lt; &quot;tū cantēs&quot;, indicative &quot;tu cante&quot; &lt; &quot;tū cantās&quot; (now &quot;tu canti&quot; in Standard Italian, borrowed from the subjunctive); &quot;amiche&quot; &quot;female friends&quot; &lt; &quot;amīcās&quot;. The palatalisation in the masculine &quot;amici&quot; , compared with the lack of palatalisation in &quot;amiche&quot; , shows that feminine &quot;-e&quot; cannot come from Latin &quot;-ae&quot;, which became by the 1st century AD and would certainly have triggered palatalisation.
* Use of nominative &quot;-i&quot; for the masculine plural, instead of the accusative &quot;-os&quot;.

<doc id="303055" wikidata="Q160539" url="?curid=303055" title="Princess Helena of the United Kingdom">
<text>Princess Helena (Helena Augusta Victoria; 25 May 1846 – 9 June 1923), later Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, was the third daughter and fifth child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.

Helena was educated by private tutors chosen by her father and his close friend and adviser, Baron Stockmar. Her childhood was spent with her parents, travelling between a variety of royal residences in Britain. The intimate atmosphere of the royal court came to an end on 14 December 1861, when her father died and her mother entered a period of intense mourning. Afterwards, in the early 1860s, Helena began a flirtation with Prince Albert&#x27;s German librarian, Carl Ruland. Although the nature of the relationship is largely unknown, Helena&#x27;s romantic letters to Ruland survive. After her mother discovered the flirtations, in 1863, she dismissed Ruland, who returned to his native Germany. Three years later, on 5 July 1866, Helena married the impoverished Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. The couple remained in Britain, in calling distance of the queen, who liked to have her daughters nearby. Helena, along with her youngest sister, Princess Beatrice, became the queen&#x27;s unofficial secretary. However, after Queen Victoria&#x27;s death on 22 January 1901, Helena saw relatively little of her surviving siblings.

Helena was the most active member of the royal family, carrying out an extensive programme of royal engagements. She was also an active patron of charities, and was one of the founding members of the British Red Cross. She was founding president of the Royal School of Needlework, and president of the Workhouse Infirmary Nursing Association and the Royal British Nurses&#x27; Association. As president of the latter, she was a strong supporter of nurse registration against the advice of Florence Nightingale. In 1916 she became the first member of her family to celebrate her 50th wedding anniversary, but her husband died a year later. Helena outlived him by six years, dying aged 77 in 1923.

==Early life==
Helena was born at Buckingham Palace, the official royal residence in London, on 25 May 1846, the day after her mother&#x27;s 27th birthday. Albert reported to his brother, Ernest II, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, that Helena &quot;came into this world quite blue, but she is quite well now&quot;. He added that the queen &quot;suffered longer and more than the other times and she will have to remain very quiet to recover.&quot; Albert and Victoria chose the names &quot;Helena Augusta Victoria&quot;. The German nickname for Helena was &quot;Helenchen&quot;, later shortened to &quot;Lenchen&quot;, the name by which members of the royal family invariably referred to Helena. As the daughter of the sovereign, Helena was styled &quot;Her Royal Highness The Princess Helena&quot; from birth. Helena was baptised on 25 July 1846 at the private chapel at Buckingham Palace. Her godparents were the Hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (the husband of Queen Victoria&#x27;s cousin); the Duchess of Orléans (for whom the queen&#x27;s mother, the Duchess of Kent, stood proxy); and the Duchess of Cambridge (the queen&#x27;s aunt).

Helena was a lively and outspoken child, and reacted against brotherly teasing by punching the bully on the nose. Her early talents included drawing. Lady Augusta Stanley, a lady-in-waiting to the queen, commented favourably on the three-year-old Helena&#x27;s artwork.

Like her sisters, she could play the piano to a high standard at an early age. Other interests included science and technology, shared by her father Prince Albert, and horse riding and boating, two of her favourite childhood occupations. However, Helena became a middle daughter following the birth of Princess Louise in 1848, and her abilities were overshadowed by her more artistic sisters.

===Death of Prince Albert===
Helena&#x27;s father, Prince Albert, died on 14 December 1861. The queen was devastated, and ordered her household, along with her daughters, to move from Windsor to Osborne House, the queen&#x27;s Isle of Wight residence. Helena&#x27;s grief was also profound, and she wrote to a friend a month later: &quot;What we have lost nothing can ever replace, and our grief is &quot;most, most&quot; bitter ... I adored Papa, I loved him more than anything on earth, his word was a most sacred law, and he was my help and adviser ... These hours were the happiest of my life, and now it is all, all over.&quot;

The queen relied on her second eldest daughter Princess Alice as an unofficial secretary, but Alice needed an assistant of her own. Though Helena was the next eldest, she was considered unreliable by Victoria because of her inability to go long without bursting into tears. Therefore, Louise was selected to assume the role in her place. Alice was married to Prince Louis of Hesse in 1862, after which Helena assumed the role—described as the &quot;crutch&quot; of her mother&#x27;s old age by one biographer—at her mother&#x27;s side. In this role, she carried out minor secretarial tasks, such as writing the queen&#x27;s letters, helping her with political correspondence, and providing her with company.

==Marriage==

===Controversy===

Princess Helena began an early flirtation with her father&#x27;s former librarian, Carl Ruland, following his appointment to the Royal Household on the recommendation of Baron Stockmar in 1859. He was trusted enough to teach German to Helena&#x27;s brother, the young Prince of Wales, and was described by the Queen as &quot;useful and able&quot;. When the Queen discovered that Helena had grown romantically attached to a royal servant, he was promptly dismissed back to his native Germany, and he never lost the Queen&#x27;s hostility.

Following Ruland&#x27;s departure in 1863, the Queen looked for a husband for Helena. However, as a middle child, the prospect of a powerful alliance with a European royal house was low. Her appearance was also a concern, as by the age of fifteen she was described by her biographer as chunky, dowdy and double-chinned. Furthermore, Victoria insisted that Helena&#x27;s future husband had to be prepared to live near the Queen, thus keeping her daughter nearby. Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; however, the match was politically awkward, and caused a severe breach within the royal family.

Schleswig and Holstein were two territories fought over between Prussia and Denmark during the First and Second Schleswig Wars. In the latter, Prussia and Austria defeated Denmark, but the duchies were claimed by Austria for Prince Christian&#x27;s family. However, following the Austro-Prussian War, in which Prussia invaded and occupied the duchies, they became Prussian, but the title Duke of Schleswig-Holstein was still claimed by Prince Christian&#x27;s family.

The marriage, therefore, horrified King Christian IX of Denmark&#x27;s daughter, Alexandra, Princess of Wales, who exclaimed: &quot;The Duchies belong to Papa.&quot; Alexandra found support in her husband, his brother Prince Alfred, and his second sister, Princess Alice, who openly accused her mother of sacrificing Helena&#x27;s happiness for the Queen&#x27;s convenience. Alice also argued that it would reduce the already low popularity of her sister, the Crown Princess of Prussia, at the court in Berlin. However, and unexpectedly, the Crown Princess, who had been a personal friend of Christian&#x27;s family for many years, ardently supported the proposed alliance.

Despite the political controversies and their age difference—he was fifteen years her senior—Helena was happy with Christian and was determined to marry him. As a younger son of a non-reigning duke, the absence of any foreign commitments allowed him to remain permanently in Britain—the Queen&#x27;s primary concern—and she declared the marriage would go ahead. Helena and Christian were actually third cousins in descent from Frederick, Prince of Wales. Relations between Helena and Alexandra remained strained, and Alexandra was unprepared to accept Christian (who was also a third cousin to Alexandra in descent from King Frederick V of Denmark) as either a cousin or brother-in-law. The Queen never forgave the Princess of Wales for accusations of possessiveness, and wrote of the Waleses shortly afterwards: &quot;Bertie is most affectionate and kind but Alix [pet name for Alexandra] is by no means what she ought to be. It will be long, if ever, before she regains my confidence.&quot;

===Engagement and wedding===

The engagement was declared on 5 December 1865, and despite the Prince of Wales&#x27;s initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion. The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George&#x27;s Chapel on 5 July 1866. The Queen relieved her black mourning dress with a white mourning cap which draped over her back. The main participants filed into the chapel to the sound of Beethoven&#x27;s Triumphal March, creating a spectacle only marred by the abrupt disappearance of Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, who had a sudden gout attack. Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted her up the aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids. Christian looked older than he was, and one guest commented that Helena looked as if she was marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, when he was first summoned to Britain, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters. The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa.

===Married life===
Helena and Christian were devoted to each other, and led a quiet life in comparison to Helena&#x27;s sisters. Following their marriage, they took up residence at Cumberland Lodge in Windsor Great Park, the traditional residence of the Ranger of Windsor Great Park, the honorary position bestowed on Christian by the Queen. When staying in London, they lived at the Belgian Suite in Buckingham Palace. The couple had six children: Christian Victor in 1867, Albert in 1869, and Helena Victoria and Marie Louise in 1870 and 1872, respectively. Their last two sons died early; Harald died eight days after his birth in 1876, and an unnamed son was stillborn in 1877. Princess Louise, Helena&#x27;s sister, commissioned the French sculptor Jules Dalou to sculpt a memorial to Helena&#x27;s dead infants.

The Christians were granted a parliamentary annuity of £6,000 a year, which the Queen requested in person. In addition, a dowry of £30,000 was settled upon, and the Queen gave the couple £100,000, which yielded an income of about £4,000 a year. As well as that of Ranger of Windsor Park, Christian was given the honorary position of High Steward of Windsor, and was made a member of the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851. However, he was often an absentee figurehead at the meetings, instead passing his time playing with his dog Corrie, feeding his numerous pigeons, and embarking on hunting excursions.
Helena, as promised, lived close to the Queen, and both she and Beatrice performed duties for her. Beatrice, whom Victoria had groomed for the main role at her side, carried out the more important duties, and Helena took on the more minor matters that Beatrice did not have time to do. In later years, Helena was assisted by her unmarried daughter, Helena Victoria, to whom the Queen dictated her journal in the last months of her life.

Helena&#x27;s health was not robust, and she was addicted to the drugs opium and laudanum. However, the Queen did not believe that Helena was really ill, accusing her of hypochondria encouraged by an indulgent husband. Queen Victoria wrote to her daughter the Crown Princess of Prussia, complaining that Helena was inclined to &quot;coddle herself (and Christian too) and to give way in everything that the great object of her doctors and nurse is to rouse her and make her think less of herself and of her confinement&quot;. Not all of her health scares were simply the result of hypochondria; in 1869, she had to cancel her trip to Balmoral Castle when she became ill at the railway station. In 1870, she was suffering from severe rheumatism and problems with her joints. In July 1871, she suffered from congestion in her lungs, an illness severe enough to appear in the Court Circular, which announced that her illness caused &quot;much anxiety to members of the royal family&quot;. In 1873, she was forced to recuperate in France as a result of illness, and in the 1880s she travelled to Germany to see an oculist.

==Activities==
===Nursing===
Helena had a firm interest in nursing, and was the founding chair of the Ladies&#x27; Committee of the British Red Cross in 1870, playing an active role in recruiting nurses and organising relief supplies during the Franco-Prussian War. She subsequently became President of the British Nurses&#x27; Association (RBNA) upon its foundation in 1887. In 1891, it received the prefix &quot;Royal&quot;, and received a royal charter the following year. She was a strong supporter of nurse registration, an issue that was opposed by both Florence Nightingale and leading public figures. In a speech Helena made in 1893, she made clear that the RBNA was working towards &quot;improving the education and &quot;status&quot; of those devoted and self-sacrificing women whose whole lives have been devoted to tending the sick, the suffering, and the dying&quot;. In the same speech, she warned about opposition and misrepresentation they had encountered. Although the RBNA was in favour of registration as a means of enhancing and guaranteeing the professional status of trained nurses, its incorporation with the Privy Council allowed it to maintain a list rather than a formal register of nurses.
Following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, the new queen, Alexandra, insisted on replacing Helena as President of the Army Nursing Service. This gave rise to a further breach between the royal ladies, with King Edward VII caught in the middle between his sister and his wife. Lady Roberts, a courtier, wrote to a friend: &quot;matters were sometimes &quot;very&quot; difficult and not always pleasant.&quot; However, in accordance with rank, Helena agreed to resign in Alexandra&#x27;s favour, and she retained presidency of the Army Nursing Reserve. Though thought to be merely an artefact created by society ladies, Helena exercised an efficient and autocratic regime—&quot;if anyone ventures to disagree with Her Royal Highness she has simply said, &#x27;It is my wish, that is sufficient.&#x27;&quot;

The RBNA gradually went into decline following the Nurses Registration Act 1919; after six failed attempts between 1904 and 1918, the British parliament passed the bill allowing formal nurse registration. What resulted was the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), and the RBNA lost membership and dominance. Helena supported the proposed amalgamation of the RBNA with the new RCN, but that proved unsuccessful when the RBNA pulled out of the negotiations. However, she remained active in other nursing organisations, and was president of the Isle of Wight, Windsor and Great Western Railway branches of the Order of St. John. In this position, she personally signed and presented many thousands of certificates of proficiency in nursing.

===Needlework===
Helena was also active in the promotion of needlework, and became the first president of the newly established &quot;School of Art Needlework&quot; in 1872; in 1876, it acquired the &quot;royal&quot; prefix, becoming the Royal School of Needlework. In Helena&#x27;s words, the objective of the school was: &quot;first, to revive a beautiful art which had been well-nigh lost; and secondly, through its revival, to provide employment for gentlewomen who were without means of a suitable livelihood.&quot; As with her other organisations, she was an active president, and worked to keep the school on an even level with other schools. She personally wrote to Royal Commissioners requesting money; for example, in 1895, she requested and acquired £30,000 for erecting a building for the school in South Kensington. Her royal status helped its promotion, and she held Thursday afternoon tea parties at the school for society ladies, who wanted to be seen in the presence of royal personages such as Princess Helena. When the Christmas Bazaar was held, she acted as chief saleswoman, generating long queues of people anxious to be served personally by her.

Helena was anxious to help children and the unemployed, and began hosting free dinners for their benefit at the Windsor Guildhall. She presided over two of these dinners, in February and March 1886, and over 3,000 meals were served to children and unemployed men during the harsh winter that year. Through her charitable activities, she became popular with the people; a contemporary author, C. W. Cooper, wrote that &quot;the poor of Windsor worshipped her&quot;.

==Writing==
Among Helena&#x27;s other interests was writing, especially translation. In 1867, when the first biography of her father, the Prince Consort was written, the author, Sir Charles Grey, notes that the Prince&#x27;s letters were translated (from German to English) by Helena &quot;with surprising fidelity&quot;. Other translations followed, and in 1887 she published a translation of &quot;The Memoirs of Wilhelmine, Margravine of Bayreuth&quot;. It was noted by the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; that Helena wrote an English version that was thoroughly alive, with a sound dictionary translation and a high accuracy in spirit. Her final translation was undertaken in 1882, on a German booklet called &quot;First Aid to the Injured&quot;, originally published by Christian&#x27;s brother-in-law. It was republished several times until 1906.

===Bergsträsser affair===
A copyright issue arose after the publication of letters written by Helena&#x27;s sister, Princess Alice. In Germany, an edition of Alice&#x27;s letters was published in 1883, by a Darmstadt clergyman called Carl Sell, who chose a selection of her letters made available to him by the Queen. When it was done, Helena wrote to Sell and requested permission to publish an English translation of the German text. It was granted, but without the knowledge of the publisher Dr Bergsträsser. In December 1883 Helena wrote to Sir Theodore Martin, a favoured royal biographer, informing him that Bergsträsser was claiming copyright of Alice&#x27;s letters, and on that basis was demanding a delay in the publication of the English edition. Martin acted as an intermediary between Helena and Bergsträsser, who claimed to have received many offers from English publishers, and that the chosen one would expect a high honorarium.

Bergsträsser was persuaded to drop his demand for a delay in publishing, and modify his copyright claims in return for a lump sum. However, the Queen and Helena refused, claiming that the copyright belonged to the Queen, and that only Sell&#x27;s original preface was open to negotiation. The royal ladies considered Bergsträsser&#x27;s claims &quot;unjustified if not impertinent&quot;, and would not communicate with him directly. Eventually, Bergsträsser came to Britain in January 1884, willing to accept £100 for the first 3,000 copies and a further £40 for each subsequent thousand copies sold. Martin chose the publisher John Murray, who after further negotiations with Bergsträsser, printed the first copies in mid-1884. It sold out almost immediately; but for the second edition, Murray replaced Sell&#x27;s biographical sketch of Princess Alice with the 53-page memoir written by Helena. The problem of royalties to Sell was thus avoided, and that Helena gave her name to the memoir to her sister attracted greater interest in the book.

== After Queen Victoria ==
===Edwardian period===
Helena&#x27;s favourite son, Prince Christian Victor, died in 1900, followed three months later by her mother Queen Victoria, who died at Osborne House on 22 January 1901. The new King, Edward VII, did not have close ties with his surviving sisters, with the exception of Princess Louise. Helena&#x27;s nephew, Prince Alexander of Battenberg (later Marquess of Carisbrooke) recorded that Queen Alexandra was jealous of the royal family, and would not invite her sisters-in-law to Sandringham. Moreover, Alexandra never fully reconciled herself to Helena and Christian following their marriage controversy in the 1860s.

Helena saw relatively little of her surviving siblings, and continued her role as a support to the monarchy and a campaigner for the many charities she represented. She and Christian led a quiet life, but did carry out a few royal engagements. On one such occasion, the elderly couple represented the King at the silver wedding anniversary, in 1906, of Kaiser Wilhelm II (Helena&#x27;s nephew) and his wife Augusta Victoria (Christian&#x27;s niece). During the Edwardian period, Helena visited the grave of her son, Prince Christian Victor, who died in 1900 following a bout with malaria while serving in the Second Boer War. She was met by South African Prime Minister Louis Botha, but Jan Smuts refused to meet her, partly because he was bitter that South Africa had lost the war and partly because his son had died in a British concentration camp.

In 1902, Prince and Princess Christian moved to Schomberg House, 77–78 Pall Mall, London, half of which is now part of the Oxford and Cambridge Club.

Before the First World War, she was one of the few maternal relatives that her nephew Kaiser Wilhelm II was close to. When he welcomed his first child, he went against Prussian tradition by asking Helena, not his mother, to assign a nurse for his son, causing a family scandal.

===Later years===
King Edward died in 1910, and the First World War began four years after his death. Helena devoted her time to nursing, and her daughter, Princess Marie Louise, recorded in her memoirs that requests for news of loved ones reached Helena and her sisters. It was decided that the letters should be forwarded to Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, Princess Helena&#x27;s niece, as Sweden was neutral during the war. It was during the war that Helena and Christian celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in 1916, and despite the fact that Britain and Germany were at war, the Kaiser sent a congratulatory telegram to his aunt and uncle through the Crown Princess of Sweden. King George V and Queen Mary were present when the telegram was received, and the King remarked to Helena&#x27;s daughter, Marie Louise, that her former husband, Prince Aribert of Anhalt, did her a service when he turned her out. When Marie Louise said she would have run away to Britain if she was still married, the King said, &quot;with a twinkle in his eye&quot;, that he would have had to intern her.
In 1917, in response to the wave of anti-German feeling that surrounded the war, George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor. He also disposed of his family&#x27;s German titles and styles, so Helena and her daughters simply became &quot;Princess Christian, Princess Helena Victoria and Princess Marie Louise&quot; with no territorial designation. Helena&#x27;s surviving son, Albert, fought on the side of the Prussians, though he made it clear that he would not fight against his mother&#x27;s country. In the same year, on 28 October, Prince Christian died at Schomberg House. Helena&#x27;s last years were spent arguing with Commissioners, who tried to turn her out of Schomberg House and Cumberland Lodge because of the expense of running her households. They failed, as clear evidence of her right to live in those residences for life was shown.

===Death===
Princess Helena died at Schomberg House on 9 June 1923 at the age of 77. Her funeral, described as a &quot;magnificently stage-managed scene&quot; by her biographer Seweryn Chomet, was headed by King George V. The regiment of her favourite son, Prince Christian Victor, lined the steps of St. George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor Castle. Although originally interred in the Royal Vault at St George&#x27;s on 15 June 1923, her body was reburied at the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore, a few miles from Windsor, after its consecration on 23 October 1928.

==Legacy==
Helena was devoted to nursing, and took the lead at the charitable organisations she represented. She was also an active campaigner, and wrote letters to newspapers and magazines promoting the interests of nurse registration. Her royal status helped to promote the publicity and society interest that surrounded organisations such as the Royal British Nurses&#x27; Association. The RBNA still survives today with Aubrey Rose as president. Emily Williamson founded the Gentlewomen&#x27;s Employment Association in Manchester; one of the projects which came out of this group was the Princess Christian Training College for Nurses, in Fallowfield, Manchester.

In appearance, Helena was described by John Van der Kiste as plump and dowdy; and in temperament, as placid, and business-like, with an authoritarian spirit. On one occasion, during a National Dock Strike, the Archbishop of Canterbury composed a prayer hoping for its prompt end. Helena arrived at the church, examined her service sheet, and in a voice described by her daughter as &quot;the penetrating royal family whisper, which carried farther than any megaphone&quot;, remarked: &quot;That prayer won&#x27;t settle any strike.&quot; Her appearance and personality was criticised in the letters and journals of Queen Victoria, and biographers followed her example. However, Helena&#x27;s daughter, Princess Marie Louise, described her as:

Music was one of her passions; in her youth she played the piano with Charles Hallé, Jenny Lind and Clara Butt, who were among her personal friends, and she was amongst the first members of the Bach Choir of London, founded by Lind&#x27;s husband (and Helena&#x27;s former piano teacher) Otto Goldschmidt. Her determination to carry out a wide range of public duties won her widespread popularity. She twice represented her mother at Drawing Rooms, attendance at which was considered equivalent to being presented to the queen herself.

Helena was closest to her brother, Prince Alfred, who considered her his favourite sister. Though described by contemporaries as fearfully devoted to the Queen Victoria, to the point that she did not have a mind of her own, she actively campaigned for women&#x27;s rights, a field the queen abhorred. Nevertheless, both she and Beatrice remained closest to the queen, and Helena remained close to her mother&#x27;s side until the latter&#x27;s death. Her name was the last to be written in the queen&#x27;s seventy-year-old journal.
