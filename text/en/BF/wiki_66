It is presumed that the regions that form the district were formerly under the rule of Pandalam, which had connections with the Pandya kingdom. When Pandalam was added to the princely state of Travancore in 1820, the region came under Travancore administration. The Nedumpuram Palace near Thiruvalla belongs to Valluvanad Royal family.

<text>A psammosere is the sequence of plant succession that has been initiated on sand. 

A psammosere is an intermediate stage in ecological succession, known as a seral community, that begins life on newly exposed coastal sand. The most common psammoseres are sand dune systems. Psammosere is a form of xerosere succession, meaning it begins in an environment with limited to no freshwater availability.

== History ==
Psammosere&#x27;s literal meaning is “originating on sand&quot;. It was named by Frederic E. Clements who described the sequence in &quot;Plant Succession&quot; 1916, although it had also been observed by Henry Chandler Cowles after he conducted several studies on the sand dunes surrounding Lake Michigan, which was influenced by the work of Eugenius Warming.

== Sand dune systems ==
In a psammosere, the organisms closest to the sea will be pioneer species: halophytes (salt-tolerant species) such as littoral algae and glasswort, with marram grass stabilising the dunes. Progressing inland, many characteristics of the ground change which helps determine the natural succession of the dunes. 

For instance, the drainage slows down as the land becomes more compact and the soils improve in quality, and the pH drops as the proportion of seashell fragments reduces and the amount of humus increases. Sea purslane, sea lavender, meadow grass and heather eventually grade into a typical non-maritime ecosystem. The first trees (or pioneer trees) that appear are typically fast-growing trees such as pine, birch, willow or rowan. In turn these will be replaced by slow-growing, larger trees such as ash and oak. This is the climax community, defined as the point where a plant succession does not develop any further because it has reached equilibrium with the environment, in particular the climate.

The later stages of a psammosere appear when the sand stops moving due to lower wind speeds. These lower wind speeds can be because of distance from the shoreline or the formation of higher dunes, acting as windbreaks, or a combination of both of these factors. The process by which different stages succeed each other is known as &quot;plant colonisation&quot;.

=== Effect on pH ===
In an idealised model of a coastal psammosere at the seaward edge of the sand dune, the pH of the soil is typically alkaline/neutral with a pH of 7.0/8.0 particularly where shell fragments provide a significant component of the sand. Further inland, the soil&#x27;s pH decreases as the soil gets more acidic. Tracking inland across the dunes, a podsol develops with a pH of 5.0 – 4.0, followed by mature podsols at the climax with a pH of 3.5 – 4.5.
=== Human effects ===
Psammosere succession is also extremely vulnerable to human activities. At beaches, footpaths over dunes will trample grass, creating exposed sand. This exposed sand can be blown away very easily, leading to the roots becoming exposed and neighbouring plants dying. This creates blowouts, which can set back psammosere succession.

Efforts have also been made to improve the psammosere in some regards. In some areas, pine trees are an invasive species and can take over heathland. The National Trust in the UK encourages people to pull up small Pine trees as they can leave needles on the ground, which can prevent further psammosere succession through the dropping of needles.

<text>The Romanian Intelligence Service (, abbreviated SRI) is Romania&#x27;s main domestic intelligence service. Its role is to gather information relevant to national security and hand it over to relevant institutions, such as Romanian Government, presidency and law enforcement departments and agencies. The service is gathering intelligence by ways such as signals intelligence (SIGINT), open-source intelligence (OSINT) and human intelligence (HUMINT). It operates predominately within Romanian territory but also outside national borders in collaboration with other states specifically to target cross-border threats. 

==History==

===Previous intelligence services in Romania===

In 1865, the Romanian General Staff (inspired by the French system) created the 2nd Section (&quot;Secția a II-a&quot;) to gather and analyze military intelligence. This marked a growing interest in centralising intelligence efforts spurring the creation of the General Safety Bureau in 1892 within the Ministry of the Interior with responsibilities pertaining to the safety of the state. However, despite ambitions, the various government entities and associated municipal governance structures were not set up in a way which allowed for national, collective intelligence services. Prior to 1905, Romania’s regional police forces were dependent on the local politics and had no strategic continuity. The Peasants Revolt in 1907 highlighted critical gaps in oversight, specifically in the ability to ascertain with certainty the motives behind the revolt and whether any foreign elements were involved in the events.

In March 1908, the Bureau became the Police and General Safety Directorate. Among its responsibilities of leading judicial and law enforcement matters nationally, it would also occupy itself with gathering intelligence pertaining to events and offences with a political footprint. In a bid to correct the gaps of the past, police infrastructure was reorganised with regional brigades in each municipal capital. Funded centrally and with a focus on gathering information pertaining to the security of state borders, a key distinguishing feature was the complete independence from regional politics thereby ensuring a stable and organised entity. The intelligence gathering responsibilities were shared with the Prefect’s Office of the Capital City Police and General Inspectorate of the Gendarmerie. In parallel with law enforcement developments, select intelligence and counter-intelligence units were being created by the Romanian Army with a remit of both at home and abroad.

Between 1914 and 1918 Romania faced unrest on several fronts including corruption, espionage and a unification war. The impact of recent reorganisation efforts should not be overlooked. The establishment of central entities for gathering, processing and sharing information critical to national security allowed the Romanian State to maintain its integrity in the face of more powerful states in central Europe and uncover German spies, some in positions of power within government and armed forces.

As of 1918, the State of Romania included 3 new provinces which brought their own challenges to national security considerations. New ethnic minority groups, now under the geographic territory of Romania, formed political and revolutionary groups causing further unrest. Simultaneously, there were significant political and social issues emerging in the aftermath of the first world war which would continue to overshadow national security decisions for decades to come. For this reason, national security became wholly focused on domestic issues and lost sight of foreign threats even though, it can be argued that espionage threats were increasing across Europe.

It is critical at this point to highlight that the geographic location of Romania was considered strategically advantageous for political, economic and military interests and coveted for its rich natural resources. For example, German and Anglo competing (and often in conflict) interests in expansion have often played out in Romanian territory. This hidden war gave rise to many espionage operations by France and the United Kingdom. Various publications in the years that followed which boasted of successful agents and their missions prompted the start of a new department of intelligence.

By 1925, after several years of efforts, Mihail Moruzov managed to convince the General Staff about the necessity of a secret service that uses civilian employees to gather intelligence of interest to the Romanian Army. Information sharing and collaboration across both intelligence and counterintelligence strengthened and included areas of focus such as politics, economy, minorities and counterespionage. The new service would also develop areas of surveillance, in particular of ethnic minority communities.

Moruzov&#x27;s leadership of the Secret Service occurred during a time of turbulent socio-political developments, including the rise of the Iron Guard, the threat of Communism and the uncertain role of the Monarchy. His activities, which often included gathering compromising information about key political figures, drew the attention of Ion Antonescu who would become Head of State following the abdication and exile of King Carol II. In September 1940, Moruzov was arrested and put on trial. 

Learning from the failings of the Secret Service under Moruzov, Antonescu relaunched the service in 1940 as the Special Service of Intelligence (&quot;Serviciul Special de Informații&quot;) with Eugen Cristescu as official director. The new service was under the direct authority of the Head of State thereby severing the influence of the army element however they would continue to collaborate on a more equal footing; it would also be funded by the Ministry of Defence and as such spending would be monitored accordingly. As World War II loomed, the activities of the S.S.I. began to attract negative attention from other elements of government, particularly the Ministry of Justice. 

Though the political independence enjoyed during Moruzov was not wielded in a way which boosted national security, the alternative placed the service under the direct control of the government and would later be used against those who opposed government directives. Antonescu, in assuming power in September 1940 also allowed the Legionary Movement and by extension the Iron Guard access to the highest echelons of power. Further collaboration with German entities such as the Abwehr further galvanised the movement and those who opposed the regime were at increased risk.

Similarly, through the communist period (1947 to 1989), the service was used as an oppressive instrument against the anti-communists and people who opposed the government&#x27;s official policies. The &quot;Securitate&quot; (&quot;Security&quot;) was the political police that was involved in repressing dissent. During the Romanian Revolution, soon after taking power, Ion Iliescu signed the decree which integrated the Securitate into the Ministry of Defense, thus bringing it under his control.

, the head of the Securitate, together with some of his deputies, were arrested on December 31, 1989; Iliescu named Gelu Voican Voiculescu as the new head of the Securitate. Voiculescu assured the Securitate agents that he does not intent to wage a war against individual Securitate officers and, by mid-January 1990, the Securitate officers continued their activity in their old headquarters. The press was informed (but not allowed to verify) that the equipment for tapping phones had been decommissioned.

=== Creation ===
The Romanian Intelligence Service was officially created on March 26, 1990, taking over the buildings, staff, equipment, and virtually everything that belonged to the Securitate. Its creation occurred only a few days following the ethnic clashes of Târgu Mureș, being quickly created through a decree. Its first director was Virgil Măgureanu. At that time, there were two other intelligence services: UM 0215 and the Foreign Intelligence Service.

===Securitate archives===
SRI inherited Securitate&#x27;s archives and it has been accused of destroying parts of it or supplying sensitive parts to certain politicians.

On June 22, 1990, SRI officers unloaded a truck full of Securitate documents in a forest in Berevoești, Argeș County, after which they buried them with soil. The documents intended to be destroyed were discovered by locals and, a year later, a group of journalists began digging the decaying documents and the &quot;România liberă&quot; newspaper published several of them, including information on dissidents, being not only Securitate, but also of the newly created SRI. This led to the adoption of a law on state secrets, which banned publication of any SRI documents.

It was only in 2005 that the archives of the Securitate began to be transferred to an outside institution (CNSAS) with a first batch containing two-thirds of the total number of documents. The goal was to transfer all Securitate documents which &quot;do not affect national security&quot;.

===Involvement in the Mineriad===

The extent of the involvement of the Romanian Intelligence Service in the violent repression of the 1990 anti-government protests has been a matter of debate. On June 12, 1990, the government decided that the Police and Army, in collaboration with the Intelligence Service, evacuate the protesters of University Square. During the violence that followed, the protesters attacked the headquarters of the Romanian Intelligence Service with rocks and Molotov cocktails.

The following days, miners brought by the government from the Jiu Valley violently repressed the protesters (killing several people and wounding thousands) and destroyed the opposition parties&#x27; headquarters. According to a letter to President Iliescu drafted by then-Prime Minister Petre Roman, the whole repression was organized by the secret services under the leadership of Virgil Măgureanu using the network of the Securitate. This view is supported by military prosecutor Dan Voinea, who said that all the miner groups were escorted by police and SRI agents who led them to the headquarters of parties and NGOs.

During the 2000s, Virgil Măgureanu, the head of the SRI at the time, has been investigated by prosecutors (together with other leaders including President Ion Iliescu) for several counts including genocide and torture, however they decided in 2009 not to charge him with any crime.

===Phone tapping===

In 1996, a former SRI employee, Constantin Bucur was the whistleblower who alerted the media that the Romanian Intelligence Service was performing illegal phone tappings of politicians, journalists and other public figures. Bucur was convicted for revealing top secret information, but he won a trial against the Romanian state after appealing at the European Court of Human Rights.

Mircea Toma, one of the journalists whose phone had been tapped also sued the Romanian state for wiretapping and preserving private conversations with his daughter, Sorana. He also won a compensation the disrespect of the Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Romanian Intelligence Service refused to collaborate with the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that its documents are state secrets.

The president of the Group of Political Investigations (a Romanian organization that independently monitors the activity of state agencies), Mugur Ciuvică, has stated that he has evidence of ongoing illegal phone tappings.

According to Ilie Botoș, a former Attorney General of Romania, between 1991 and 2003, the phones of 20,000 people have been tapped. Between 1991 and 2002, a number of 14,000 authorizations were given by the government for national security-related issues. Between 1996 and 2003, further 5,500 authorizations were given related to organized and white-collar crime; out of these 5,500 suspects, only 238 were convicted. For the year 2005, a number of 6370 phones belonging to 2373 people were tapped, the average tapping being of 220 days.

In 2006, a new illegal wiretapping scandal erupted after transcripts of businessman Dinu Patriciu&#x27;s phone discussions with his associates were leaked to the press. Patriciu sued the Intelligence Service and won a compensation of 50,000 lei in 2011. A further case of potentially illegal wiretappings is the one of European Court of Human Rights judge Corneliu Bîrsan, whose wiretappings under the guise of &quot;national security&quot; are now being investigated by a parliamentary commission created by the Romanian Senate on April 8, 2013.

===Relationship with the press===
The Romanian Intelligence Service had an uneasy relationship with the press, which it monitored, infiltrated and accused of being a national security liability. In 2010, &quot;the press&quot; has been included in the list of national vulnerabilities in the &quot;National Strategy for the Defence of the Country&quot;.

An early controversy occurred in 1996, when Tana Ardeleanu (a journalist for &quot;Ziua&quot; who had published some articles about President Ion Iliescu) had been by SRI agents. Amid press anger, SRI director Virgil Măgureanu admitted that SRI agents followed Ardeleanu and argued that the surveillance was a &quot;mistake&quot; and that the agents thought they were following two suspected spies.

The existence of infiltrated SRI agents in the press has been publicly known since 2006, when the press officer of SRI claimed that the Service has always had moles in the Romanian press arguing that it&#x27;s not illegal. This claim has been quite controversial, as, according to Cristian Tudor Popescu, journalists are not a threat to national security and, according to historian Marius Oprea, this leads to suspicions about whether the SRI has political police activities.

The &quot;Jurnalul Național&quot; newspaper fired its editor-in-chief, Valentin Zaschievici, in August 2012, accusing him of being an infiltrated SRI agent, following the leak of some SRI documents by &quot;Cotidianul&quot;. The Romanian Intelligence Service admitted that the documents were indeed genuine, but it claimed that their agent was only monitoring the leaking of secret documents to the press.

In 2013, George Maior, the Director of the Service, accused the press of organizing an attack campaign against the Romanian Intelligence Service, giving as example the investigations over the illegal CIA prisons in Bucharest (Bright Light), which he argued that is exposing Romania to terrorist attacks.

===Known operations===
In March 2005, three Romanian journalists were kidnapped in Iraq by unknown abductors (later described as members of the Muadh ibn Jabal Brigades) in the Baghdad&#x27;s al-Mansur district. A few weeks after being kidnapped, the terrorists broadcast a tape on Al-Jazeera stating that they would kill the journalists if Romania did not withdraw its 860 troops from Iraq. However, due to efforts of the Romanian intelligence community and the collaboration between several intelligence agencies, the group were freed on May 23, 2005, when they were placed in the hands of the Romanian Embassy in Baghdad. It is believed that Florian Coldea (the former deputy director of the SRI) coordinated the rescue operation.

On 28 February 2008, the Romanian counter-intelligence officers arrested a Bulgarian military attaché, Petar Marinov Zikolov, and a Romanian NCO, Floricel Achim. They have been prosecuted with charges of espionage. It is believed that the leaked information might have been sent to Russia or Ukraine. The Bulgarians have denied any connection with Zikolov. This has been one of the few espionage cases that have received media attention.

===Integrated Information System===
The Integrated Information System (Romanian: &quot;Sistemul Informatic Integrat,&quot; SII) is a computing system that allows SRI to aggregate data from various governmental agencies. It was created in 2003 under the initiative of SRI director Radu Timofte, who sent a request to the Supreme Council of National Defence (CSAT) led by President Ion Iliescu. The system has its activities based on secret laws that were not published in &quot;Monitorul Oficial&quot;. The only public information on the system is found in the government decision that followed, which mandated all state institutions to give the system all the information they have. The public law does not include any kind of control mechanisms or ways to prevent abuses.

As such, all information on Romanian and foreign citizens that the state has (such as dates of entering/exiting the country, what car one owns, what phone numbers or phone metadata or what taxes you paid) is fed into the system. The names of the members of the Integrated Information System council and its headquarters are a state secret.

Civil rights NGO APADOR-CH (Human Rights Defense Association of Romania) contested in justice the way it worked, arguing that such a government institution couldn&#x27;t have been legally created by the way of secret laws and that it broke the Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The NGO lost the trial.

In 2016, the SRI obtained a €25 million in financing from the European Union for a project called &quot;SII Analytics.&quot; The project is financed by the E-government program of the EU, but parts of it such as interception of communications and facial recognition show that one of the goals is surveillance. The project includes a &quot;good behavior&quot; file for each citizen, which aggregates data from all government agencies. APADOR-CH argued that these citizen files can be used for nefarious purposes against some citizens (MPs, judges, prosecutors, businessmen, etc.).

===National Alert System===
The National Alert System (Sistemul Național de Alertă Teroristă in Romanian) is the Romanian terrorist barometer. SNA is a system that, based on existing intelligence from SRI, SIE and possibly other agencies, ranks the risk of a terrorist attack on Romanian territory. The system is color based (green-low to red-imminent). The color can be changed (and therefore security measures increased) with the prior approval of the executive of SRI.

Currently, SNA is colored blue-cautious; this means that the intelligence on hand suggests there is a relatively low risk of a terrorist attack.

The color has only been changed once (to yellow-moderate) at the 2008 NATO Bucharest summit.

===Personnel===
The Romanian Intelligence Service is a militarized institution, although it is not a part of the Romanian Armed Forces. The hierarchy from the service is defined by military ranks. The highest ranking employee has the rank of general officer (with four stars). Civilian personnel is composed mostly of accountants, IT and law specialists. 
The number of employees is classified. However, rumors about the number of employees exists. The newspaper &quot;Adevărul&quot; was able to find in 2006 an estimate of 12,000 agents, a figure confirmed by former SIE director Cătălin Harnagea. According to former DIE general Ion Mihai Pacepa, this figure is double the number of agents of the similar service of France (which has a population three times larger than Romania&#x27;s) and larger than Germany&#x27;s secret services, Pacepa noting the unusual size of Romania&#x27;s secret services, leading to claims that Ceaușescu&#x27;s police state has been incompletely dismantled and that the number of officers has actually increased since 1989. In an interview in Jurnalul Național, George Maior denied the numbers Harnagea claimed, saying that the SRI has an estimated number of 3,000 operative employees. According to Maior, the average salary in the service is 2,500 Lei (€560), a salary above the average income in Romania.

To become an employee of the SRI, a person has to fulfill several conditions, including having Romanian citizenship, matching the age criteria, clean criminal record and no serious medical conditions. If so, the person is allowed in the recruitment process. This process consists of background checks, medical exams, aptitude tests, personality tests, physical fitness tests and a paper exam (for example, a general knowledge test).

The main gate to enter the intelligence service is the National Intelligence Academy (&quot;Academia Națională de Informații Mihai Viteazul&quot;) from Bucharest.

===The Anti-Terrorist Brigade===
The Anti-Terrorist Brigade (Brigada Antiteroristă), also known as &quot;BAT&quot; is SRI&#x27;s special actions unit and the main anti-terrorist unit from Romania. Created during the mid 1970s (as a response to the 1972 Munich Massacre) under the name of ARTA, the unit has changed its name later into &quot;The Special Anti-Terrorist Unit&quot; (&quot;USLA - Unitatea Specială de Luptă Antiteroristă&quot;).

Eight USLA members were killed during the Romanian Revolution in December 1989.

The size of the brigade is classified, but it is known that the unit has in ranks the best operatives from the Romanian military and law enforcement sector. Most of them are athletes, with excellent results in sports such as boxing, karate, rugby, judo, and other combat sports.

Also, the brigade is providing security on all important airports from Romania and members of the brigade are working as air marshals on all Romanian flights.

<text>The VIC (Video Interface Chip), specifically known as the [[MOS Technology]] 6560 (NTSC version) / 6561 (PAL version), is the integrated circuit chip responsible for generating video graphics and sound in the VIC-20 home computer from Commodore. It was originally designed for applications such as low-cost CRT terminals, biomedical monitors, control system displays and arcade or home video game consoles.

The chip was designed by Al Charpentier in 1977 but Commodore could not find a market for the chip. In 1979, MOS Technology began work on a video chip named &quot;MOS Technology 6564&quot; intended for the &quot;TOI&quot; computer and had also made some work on another chip, &quot;MOS 6562&quot; intended for a color version of the Commodore PET. Both of these chips failed due to memory timing constraints (both required very fast and thus expensive SRAM, making them unsuitable for mass production). Before finally starting to use the VIC in the VIC-20, chip designer Robert Yannes fed features from the 6562 (a better sound generator) and 6564 (more colors) back to the 6560, so before beginning mass production for the VIC-20 it had been thoroughly revised.

Its features include:
* 16 kB address space for screen, character and color memory (only 5 kB points to RAM on the VIC-20 without a hardware modification)
* 16 colors (the upper 8 can only be used in the global background and auxiliary colors)
* two selectable character sizes (8×8 or 8×16 bits; the pixel width is 1 bit for &quot;hires&quot; characters and 2 bits for &quot;multicolor&quot; characters)
* maximum video resolution depends on the television system (176 × 184 is the standard for the VIC-20 firmware, although up to 248 × 232p/464i is possible on the NTSC machine and up to 256 × 280 is possible on the PAL machine)
* 4 channel sound system (3 square wave + &quot;white&quot; noise + global volume setting)
* on-chip DMA
* two 8-bit analog-to-digital converter
* light pen support
Unlike many other video circuits of the era, it does not offer dynamic RAM refresh capabilities. Thus the VIC-20 employed the more expensive static RAM (SRAM) chips. This is likely the reason why the machine was sold with just 5 KB of RAM. Memory expansions for the VIC-20 either used SRAM as well or implemented their own refresh circuit.

The VIC was programmed by manipulating its 16 control registers, memory mapped to the memory address range $9000–$900F in the VIC-20 address space. The on-chip A/D converters were used for dual paddle position readings by the VIC-20, which also used the VIC&#x27;s light pen facility. The VIC preceded the much more advanced VIC-II, used by the VIC-20&#x27;s successors, the C64 and C128.

VIC-20s with expansion RAM have their video memory (550 bytes) at $1000 and when it is not present, $1E00. User-defined character sets must be placed within the first 5k of system RAM. The default PETSCII character ROM is at $8000 and each character takes 8 bytes to store. Up to 128 characters may be used at any one time. While the PET had a backslash (\) in its character set, this was replaced on the VIC-20 (and all subsequent Commodore machines) with a British pound sign (£).

Programmable characters are the only way of creating graphics and animation on the VIC as the chip does not have sprites or an all-points-addressable bitmap mode. Of the 16 colors in the palette, eight may be used for the foreground (per the color RAM at $9400) and border while the others are limited to the background and auxiliary multicolors. The MSB of the color RAM is a flag used to indicate if that character is multicolor or high resolution. Due to the extreme blockiness of the former, most VIC-20 games use hires characters.

The VIC does not support scrolling or raster interrupts like on the VIC-II, but the scanline counters could be polled for a specific point on the screen to produce raster effects. This feature was rarely used in games except for a few titles like Imagic&#x27;s Demon Attack.

Sound programming on the VIC is done by placing a frequency value in one of the four registers at $900A-$900D (they are turned off by writing a zero to them). The first three are square wave generators pitched half an octave from each other and the fourth is for white noise.

==Registers==

The VIC has 16 read/write registers listed below:

<text>San Lorenzo de El Escorial, also known as El Escorial de Arriba, is a town and municipality in the Community of Madrid, Spain, located to the northwest of the region in the southeastern side of the Sierra de Guadarrama, at the foot of Mount Abantos and , from Madrid. It is head of the eponymous judicial party. The settlement is popularly called El Escorial de Arriba, to differentiate it from the neighbouring village of El Escorial, also known as El Escorial de Abajo.

The Monastery of El Escorial is the most prominent building in the town and is one of the main Spanish Renaissance monuments. Especially remarkable is the Royal Library, inside the Monastery.

The monastery and its historic surroundings were declared a World Heritage Site UNESCO on November 2, 1984, under the name of &quot;El Escorial, monastery and site&quot;.

The site also enjoys protection on Spain&#x27;s heritage register; since June 21, 2006, it has been protected by the Community of Madrid as a Property of Cultural Interest.

San Lorenzo de El Escorial is located on the southern slopes of the Mount Abantos (elevation 1753 m). The average altitude of the municipality is , and most of the urban area is above . The hamlet initially sprang up around Monastery of El Escorial, gradually extending up the mountain. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the town underwent a strong urban expansion, particularly towards the southeastern side of Mount Abantos.

==Geography==

===Elevation and hydrography===
The township&#x27;s average altitude is . Most of the town is situated at about above sea level, including the Monastery of El Escorial, which lies approximately above the town. The highest part is the top of Mount Abantos, which is above sea level.

The town covers a total area of , most of which is mountainous terrain. In the south of the municipality is the &quot;Circo de El Escorial&quot;, bordered by the southern slopes of Mount Abantos to the south and the hills to the north. North, along the slope of , lies the Valle de los Caídos (Valley of the Fallen), near the border with Guadarrama. Towards the Southwest, the municipality extends down to El Escorial by the parks and gardens of the Casita del Príncipe.

San Lorenzo de El Escorial lies in the watershed of the Guadarrama river. The , born in Las Machotas, is the main tributary of the Guadarrama, after crossing the neighbouring village of El Escorial. The streams include small reservoirs.

===Vegetation===
The types of vegetation differ due to the municipality&#x27;s fluctuation in altitude. In its lower altitudes, about , there are pastures with narrow-leafed ash (Fraxinus angustifolia); and in the forest of La Herrería grow Pyrenean oaks (Quercus pyrenaica), sweet chestnuts (Castanea sativa) and Montpellier maples (Acer monspessulanum).

In the higher altitudes () appear maritime (Pinus pinaster) and stone pines (Pinus pinea), as well as holm oaks (Quercus ilex), prickly junipers (Juniperus oxycedrus) and labdanum (Cistus ladanifer). Up to grows Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and black pine (Pinus nigra).

San Lorenzo de El Escorial also has some allochthonous in its mountain areas, plant species as beech (American beech), cedars, larches, Lawson cypresses (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), and sycamores (Acer pseudoplatanus). Students of a forestry school planted these trees during the early 20th century.

There are also trees of historical significance, including giant sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum), planted in the 18th century in the parks and gardens of the Casita del Príncipe.

Much of the municipality is contained within the &quot;Abantos pine forest&quot; and the Herrería zone, a protected nature area since 1961 and extends to an area that San Lorenzo de El Escorial shares with Santa María de la Alameda.

The center of environmental education houses a collection of over 200 species of trees and bushes native to the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands.

==History==

The history of San Lorenzo de El Escorial is inexorably linked to the construction of the monastery and the town named El Escorial. The first historical references of this building date year 1558 where Philip II of Spain appointed a commission to find a proper place for the site, architects, doctors and quarrymen, among other guilds.

The hamlet of El Escorial met physical conditions for carrying out such company. Its abundance of forests, quarries and game reserves, the quality of its water and its place in the geographic center of Spain, at the foot of Mount Abantos, were determining factors for the final choice, which took place in 1561.

Builders placed the first stone of the monastery on April 23, 1563. A year earlier, Philip II began efforts to acquire the land adjacent to the site of the future monastery, with the intention of creating a territory of realengo, Royal Site of El Escorial, intended for agriculture, fishing, hunting and recreational uses. Among them were the meadow &quot;(Dehesa)&quot; of the ironworks of Fuentelámparas (today called La Herrería), located in the current term of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, and La Granjilla de La Fresneda de El Escorial, farms in the neighbouring village of El Escorial.

Construction lasted 21 years, which transformed the urban and social environment of El Escorial. The hamlet became a &quot;villa&quot; in 1565. A Lord Mayor exercised rule over the villa. The Lord Mayor&#x27;s authority did not extend to the game reserves that the Crown managed directly, nor to agricultural uses managed by the monastery&#x27;s Prior.

Through two papal bulls issued dated 1585 and 1586, the Roman Catholic Church removed the monastery from the control of the powerful Archbishop of Toledo and placed it under the monastery&#x27;s Prior.

This administrative structure remained well into the 18th century, when the monarch Carlos III imposed a new territorial and administrative framework. The construction of houses, expressly prohibited in the outskirts of the monastery, was the cause of a dispute that faced the municipal authorities, who promoted a modification of the rules, and those who sought to restrict new construction. The subject was particularly delicate in those days, given the frequent visits of the royal family to the site; these visits led to an increase in demand for land to build houses and support buildings mainly for civil servants working in the royal household.

The resolution of the conflict came from King Carlos III, who, on May 3, 1767, authorized housing next to the market of the monastery, which was the birth of the municipality of San Lorenzo de El Escorial and the beginning of a process which culminated in the emancipation of the town from El Escorial. The development of this new hamlet was very fast, reaching a population of more than a thousand only a few years after Carlos III allowed the town&#x27;s expansion.

The new settlement emerging at the foot of the monastery did not achieve self-rule until much later. The administrative structure designed by Philip II was blurring, first with the appointment of a governor by Carlos III—detrimental to the powers of the Lord Mayor and El Escorial&#x27;s Prior—and, subsequently, with the privatization of land.

This was key to the structural development of the current municipality of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, since this privatization extended over most of the royal lands except for the Herrería farms, land surrounding the monastery, the Prince&#x27;s Cottage and the Infant&#x27;s Cottage.

On September 26, 1836, San Lorenzo de El Escorial became an independent municipality. In 1887, it elected its first mayor. To date, 22 people have served in this role.

During the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), the people remained loyal to the Republican government and briefly changed the town&#x27;s name to El Escorial of the Sierra.

Today the city of San Lorenzo de El Escorial consists of 12 localities: Colmenar del Arroyo, Colmenarejo, El Escorial, Fresnedillas de la Oliva, Navalagamella, Robledo de Chavela, Santa María de la Alameda, Valdemaqueda, Valdemorillo, Villanueva del Pardillo and Zarzalejo, and the monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial.

==Demography==
San Lorenzo de El Escorial had 17,346 inhabitants, according to the National Institute of statistics (INE), as of 2008. At that time It had a population density of 307.55 inhabitants/square km (796.55 inhabitants/square mile), similar to other municipalities like El Escorial, but much lower than the regional average of the Comunidad de Madrid (808.17 inhabitants/square km (2,093.16 inhabitants/square mile)). The density was more than three times the Spanish average of 94.06 inhabitants/square km (243.62 inhabitants/square mile).

The area is culturally diverse, with large numbers of Moroccan and Latin American immigrants.

As of 2006, 51.7% of San Lorentinos were women and the remaining 48.3% were men. Foreigners represent 10.07% of the total population. The average age was 37.8 years. The annual population growth was 4.2%.

The transient population of San Lorenzo de El Escorial is very high. This is a major residential site; second homes proliferated with usage during weekends and vacation periods. In addition, the municipality receives daily large numbers of tourists attracted by its historical and natural heritage.


==Economy==
Tourism, hospitality and trade are the main economic activities of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. The municipality is one of the most important tourist destinations in the community of Madrid. Visitors usually make day trips with Madrid tourism as a starting point. The number of tourists staying overnight are insignificant as in other historical cities in the region, such as Alcalá de Henares, Aranjuez or Chinchón.

In recent years, the town has attempted to consolidate hotel tourism, trade fairs, conventions and cultural and educational nature courses. The Universidad Complutense holds summer courses to promote San Lorenzo de El Escorial as a Euroforum installations. The municipality has 10 hotels with a total of 611 rooms (year 2006).

Inside of this municipality are two of the most visited monuments in the nation national. The Monastery of El Escorial is the second most visited monument with highest number of visits (504,238 tourists 2004), short of the Royal Palace of Madrid (720,710 in the same year). The Valley of the Fallen, located on the outskirts of town, is the third in the national list (407,578).

Construction is another economic activity on the rise in San Lorenzo de El Escorial. Although much of its area is protected, as with the Herrería forests, the town has experienced strong urban growth in recent years, with the creation of new housing developments in areas that lack legal protection from development. This is the case of the southeastern slope of Mount Abantos, which has many newly constructed neighbourhoods, especially after the August 21, 1999, fire that burned of pine.

==Main sights==


The town has an important historical-artistic, urban and cultural heritage, a result of its link with the Spanish crown. It adds relevant ecological, geological and archaeological values.

Part of the monument is listed with the heritage list of UNESCO. In addition, this site has been awarded bien de Interés Cultural, in the category of historical sites, with the name of &quot;Escorial: monastery, natural and cultural environment&quot;, from the community of Madrid.

The last legal figure, approved by Decree 52/2006 (June 21), also includes the towns of El Escorial, Zarzalejo and Santa María de la Alameda. This is the area which was within the so-called domain of Philip II, with which the monarch delineated the perimeter of the royal site in the area around the Monasterio.

===World Heritage sites===
On November 2, 1984, during the quadricentennial of the placement of the last stone of the monastery&#x27;s construction, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina, added &quot;El Escorial, monastery and site&quot; to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The List defines territorial protection for the Monasterio de El Escorial, the Casita of Infante (or upper palace), and the Casita del Principe (or lower palace) at El Escorial. 

This building, one of the main Renaissance monuments in Spain, was erected in the last third of the 16th century on Mount Abantos at the height of . Juan Bautista de Toledo began work on the project, but it was finished after his death by Juan de Herrera, who imposed a new architectural style. The site occupies an area of 33,327 m² (358,829 square feet) and has 16 patios, 88 sources, 13 oratorios, 15 cloisters, 86 stairs, 9 towers, 1,200 doors and 2,673 windows. Its main façade is in length. The most important parts of the building include the Pantheon of Kings, the and the Royal Library. From the sixteenth century onward, the Escorial monastery has been described as &quot;the eighth wonder of the world&quot;.

The Príncipe and Infante cottages are two 18th century neoclassical mansions. Both were built by Juan de Villanueva as recreation sites for Carlos IV, then Prince of Asturias, and his brother Infante Gabriel of Spain, respectively.

The protected area set aside in the UNESCO World Heritage List is currently in the process of being enlarged. The Spanish authorities intend to extend the UNESCO heritage declaration to the entire area that was included within Philip II&#x27;s original decree.

==Celebrities==
San Lorenzo de El Escorial had close historical ties with the Spanish Crown, as place of residence and burial site of different monarchs from both Habsburg and Bourbon lines.

The presence of the Kings attracted different personalities from the world of culture and the arts towards the municipality. Apart from the long list of architects, sculptors and painters who participated in the 16th-century decoration of the El Escorial, the Girona musician Antonio Soler (Olot, 1729) died in San Lorenzo of El Escorial in 1783, where he had spent most of his career.

<text>El Escorial is a municipality in the Autonomous Community of Madrid, located 45 km (28 mi) northwest of the Spanish capital Madrid. It belongs to the comarca of Cuenca del Guadarrama. Its population in 2009 was 14,979.

The territory of El Escorial is home to the park of La Granjilla de la Fresneda. The famous Royal Seat of San Lorenzo de El Escorial also known as Monasterio de El Escorial or &quot;El Escorial&quot;, is located in the adjacent municipality of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. On the outskirts of San Lorenzo de El Escorial is the national memorial &quot;Valle de los Caídos&quot; (Valley of the Fallen).

The name of the town derives from slag (&quot;escoria&quot;) deposits from an old local foundry.

== Main sights==
*La Granjilla de La Fresneda, also known as &quot;La Fresneda&quot; and &quot;La Granjilla de La Fresneda de El Escorial&quot;, was a cottage of Philip II in the environment of the Monastery of El Escorial. La Granjilla was designed and constructed between 1561 and 1569, by Gaspar de Vega, Juan Bautista de Toledo, Juan de Herrera, Pedro de Tolosa, Fray Marcos de Cardona and Petre Janson. Situated at the foot of Mt. Abantos in the Sierra de Guadarrama, La Granjilla de La Fresneda, like El Escorial, is a multifunctional architectural complex: a place of woods, pastures and meadows with dams and artificial waterways, ponds and gardens; palace, chapel, tower, monastery for rest of the monks of El Escorial and granite boulders (e.g.: La Peña del Rey). It is located 5 km to the south-east of the Monastery of El Escorial and 3 km from the municipality of El Escorial on the M505.
*Church of St. Barnabas - based on the design of Francisco de Mora, constructed at the wish of King Philip II to replace an older church on the same site. Many expert stonemasons from the Monastery worked on its construction, cutting the granite from which its solid walls are built. The structure is notable for its simplicity and equilibrium, its harmony of line and proportion, and the almost total absence of ornamentation.
*&quot;Prestado&quot; monastery: residence of Philip II during the early years of the construction of the Monastery in San Lorenzo, the church was adapted for this use by adding new extensions and improving the existing structure. Construction was completed between 1567 and 1568. Later the building saw use as a hospital for workers on construction of the Monastery, and for making glass, from which the chimney is still visible.
*The House of the Prince (&quot;La Casita del Príncipe&quot;) - in neoclassical style, constructed between 1771 and 1775 and remodeled in 1781, under King Charles III by the architect Juan de Villanueva. It became the summer residence of the crown prince, the future Charles IV.
*Cross of Nefando - built on a rock in an interior garden of the Casita, in the first half of the 17th century
*Cross &quot;del Tercio&quot; - constructed in the 17th century, it marked the border between the neighborhoods of La Fresneda and Navalquejigo. Since 1985 it has stood at the center of a town square.
*Cross of Navaarmado - served to mark the boundary between La Fresneda and the urban center of El Escorial. The cross sits atop a large granite rock.
*Ark of St. Sebastian - from the mid-16th century, it served for the administration of water to the town. The walls are made of granite ashlars.

==Transportation==
The municipality of El Escorial contains a Renfe commuter train station connecting the area to Madrid.

==Notable residents==
L. Brent Bozell, Jr., the American conservative Catholic writer, moved his large family to the town in the mid-1960s as he became disillusioned with American politics and came to idealize Francoist Spain. He was joined by other likeminded Americans for a time, such as Reid Buckley, brother of conservative political columnist William F. Buckley Jr.

<text>Fight Test is an extended play (EP) released by the Flaming Lips released on Warner Bros. Records in 2003. The single version of &quot;Fight Test&quot; was released on June 23, 2003, peaking at number 28 on the UK Singles Chart. It is the third single to be picked from the album &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot;.

It is an enhanced CD, containing covers of Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Knives Out&quot;, Kylie Minogue&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;, and Beck&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Age&quot;. In addition, the EP includes two original songs. The UK version was a normal CD single, which also featured some previously unreleased songs. &quot;Fight Test&quot; was nominated for Best Alternative Album at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards.

The opening of &quot;Fight Test&quot; (&quot;The test begins...now&quot;) was sampled from one of the sync tests from the Flaming Lips&#x27; own Boombox Experiments. The song was also the theme song for the short-lived MTV cartoon &quot;3-South&quot;. It was furthermore used in a season 2 episode of the long-running TV series &quot;Smallville&quot;.

==Plagiarism settlement==
&quot;Fight Test&quot; is musically similar to Cat Stevens&#x27;s 1970 song &quot;Father and Son&quot;. Following a settlement with the Flaming Lips, Stevens receives 75 percent of the royalties from &quot;Fight Test&quot;. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, frontman Wayne Coyne stated:
I want to go on record for the first time and say that I really apologise for the whole thing. I really love Cat Stevens. I truly respect him as a great singer-songwriter. And now he wants his money. There was a time during the recording when we said, this has a similarity to &#x27;Father and Son&#x27;. Then we purposefully changed those bits. But I do regret not contacting his record company and asking their opinion. Maybe we could have gone 50–50. As it is, Cat Stevens is now getting 75 percent of royalties from &#x27;Fight Test&#x27;. We could easily have changed the melody but we didn&#x27;t. I am really sorry that Cat Stevens thinks I&#x27;m purposefully plagiarising his work. I am ashamed. There is obviously a fine line between being inspired and stealing. But if anyone wanted to borrow part of a Flaming Lips song, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d bother pursuing it. I&#x27;ve got better things to do. Anyway, Cat Stevens is never going to make much money out of us.

<text>Paul Howard Douglas (March 26, 1892 – September 24, 1976) was an American politician and Georgist economist. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a U.S. senator from Illinois for eighteen years, from 1949 to 1967. During his Senate career, he was a prominent member of the liberal coalition.

Born in Massachusetts and raised in Maine, Douglas graduated from Bowdoin College and Columbia University. He served as a professor of economics at several schools, most notably the University of Chicago, and earned a reputation as a reformer while a member of the Chicago City Council (1939–1942). During World War II, he served in the U.S. Marine Corps, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel and becoming known as a war hero.

He first married Dorothy Wolff in 1915. They had four children. He divorced her in 1930 and a year later married Emily Taft Douglas, daughter of sculptor Lorado Taft and a U.S. representative from Illinois&#x27;s At-large district (1945–1947).

== Early years ==
Douglas was born on March 26, 1892, in Salem, Massachusetts, the son of Annie (Smith) and James Howard Douglas. When he was four, his mother died of natural causes and his father remarried. His father was an abusive husband and his stepmother, unable to obtain a divorce, left her husband and took Douglas and his older brother to Onawa, Maine, in Piscataquis County, where her brother and uncle had built a resort in the woods.

== Academia and family life ==

In 1913, Douglas graduated from Bowdoin College, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was a Charles Carroll Everett Scholar. He then moved on to Columbia University, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in 1915 and a PhD in economics in 1921. 

In 1915, he married Dorothy Wolff, a graduate of Bryn Mawr College who also earned a Ph.D. at Columbia University.

From 1915 to 1920, the Douglases moved six times. He studied at Harvard University; taught at the University of Illinois and at Oregon&#x27;s Reed College; served as a mediator of labor disputes for the Emergency Fleet Corporation of Pennsylvania; and taught at the University of Washington. When working for the Emergency Fleet Corporation, he read John Woolman&#x27;s journals. When teaching in Seattle, he joined the Religious Society of Friends.

In 1919, Douglas took a job teaching economics at the University of Chicago. Although Douglas enjoyed his job, his wife was unable to obtain a job at the university due to anti-nepotism rules. When she obtained a job at Smith College, in Massachusetts, she persuaded her husband to move the family there. He would then start teaching at Amherst College. In 1930 the couple divorced; Dorothy Wolff Douglas began a romantic relationship with Katharine DuPre Lumpkin. Dorothy took custody of their four children, and Douglas returned to Chicago. The following year, Douglas met and married Emily Taft Douglas, daughter of sculptor Lorado Taft and a distant cousin of former president William Howard Taft. Emily was a political activist, former actress, and subsequent one-term congresswoman at-large from Illinois (1945–47).

Douglas was listed as a supporter of banking reforms suggested by University of Chicago economists in 1933 that were later referred to as the &quot;Chicago plan.&quot; In 1939, he coauthored with five other notable economists a draft proposal titled &quot;A Program for Monetary Reform&quot;. The Chicago plan and &quot;A Program for Monetary Reform&quot; generated much interest and discussion among lawmakers, but the suggested reforms did not result in any new legislation.

Douglas is probably best known to economics students as the co-author of the 1928 article with Charles Cobb that first laid out the Cobb-Douglas production function.

== Government service and city politics ==
As the 1920s drew to a close, Douglas got more involved in politics. He served as an economic advisor to Republican governor Gifford Pinchot of Pennsylvania and Democratic governor Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York. Along with Chicago lawyer Harold L. Ickes, he launched a campaign against public utility tycoon Samuel Insull&#x27;s stock market manipulations. Working with the state legislature, he helped draft laws regulating utilities and establishing old-age pensions and unemployment insurance. By the early 1930s, he was vice chairman of the League for Independent Political Action, a member of the Farmer-Labor Party&#x27;s national committee, and treasurer of the American Commonwealth Political Federation.

A registered Independent, Douglas felt that the Democratic Party was too corrupt and the Republican Party was too reactionary, views that he expressed in a 1932 book, &quot;The Coming of a New Party&quot;, in which he supported the creation of a party similar to the British Labour Party. That year, he supported Socialist candidate Norman Thomas for President of the United States.

After Roosevelt&#x27;s victory in the election, Douglas, at the recommendation of his friend Harold Ickes, was appointed to serve on the Consumers&#x27; Advisory Board of the National Recovery Administration. In 1935, however, the Supreme Court ruled that the Administration was unconstitutional, and it was abolished.

That year, Douglas made his first foray into electoral politics, campaigning for the endorsement of the local Republican Party for mayor of Chicago. Although the party endorsed someone else, Douglas continued to work with them to get their candidate elected to the city council from the 5th Ward. A strong Socialist candidate split the reform vote, however, and Democratic Party candidate James Cusack was elected.

Four years later, in 1939, Cusack came up for re-election, and Douglas joined a group of reform-minded Independents that drafted Douglas. During the municipal election cycle, Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly was challenged for re-election and attempted to shore up his reputation by lending his support to Douglas&#x27; campaign. With Kelly&#x27;s help and his own dogged campaigning, Douglas managed a narrow victory over Cusack in a runoff election.

Douglas usually found himself in the minority in the Chicago City Council. His attempts to reform the public education system and lower public transportation fares were met with derision and he typically ended up on the losing end of 49–1 votes. &quot;I have three degrees,&quot; Douglas once said after a particularly hard-fought rout. &quot;I have been associated with intelligent and intellectual people for many years. Some of these aldermen haven&#x27;t gone through the fifth grade. But they&#x27;re the smartest bunch of bastards I ever saw grouped together.&quot;

In 1942, Douglas joined the Democratic Party and ran for its nomination for the United States Senate. He had the support of a cadre of left-wing activists, but the machine supported the state&#x27;s at-large Congressman Raymond S. McKeough for the nomination. On the day of the primary, Douglas carried 99 of the state&#x27;s 102 counties, but McKeough&#x27;s strong support in Cook County allowed him to win a slim majority. McKeough would go on to lose in the general election to incumbent Republican senator C. Wayland Brooks.

== Military service ==

As alderman, Douglas had worked with &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; publisher Frank Knox in fighting corruption in Chicago. Knox, who had been Republican vice-presidential nominee in 1936, had become Secretary of the Navy, thus responsible for both the navy and the Marine Corps.

Shortly after losing the primary, Douglas resigned from the Chicago City Council. With the aid of Knox, Douglas enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on May 15, 1942, at the age of 50, becoming the oldest recruit in the history of Parris Island. Entering service as a private, Douglas was placed in an ordinary platoon and received no waivers aside from his teeth and eyesight. As a member of the 57th Street Meeting of the Quakers, Douglas recognized that joining the Marines was contrary to the traditional testimony of that group against war and offered to resign his membership; the meeting refused to release him. Initially, Douglas was kept stateside, writing training manuals and giving inspirational speeches to troops, and quickly rose to the rank of staff sergeant. With the aid of Knox and his assistant Adlai Stevenson, Douglas was commissioned as a captain on November 24, 1942. Requesting combat duty, he was subsequently sent to the Pacific theater of operations with the 1st Marine Division.

During the Battle of Peleliu, Douglas initially served as an adjutant in the 1st Marine Division headquarters before being assigned R-1 (personnel officer) of the 5th Marine Regiment. On the second day of the battle, Captain Douglas received permission to head to the front where he found work as a mobile regimental troubleshooter. He earned a Bronze Star for carrying ammunition to the front lines under enemy fire and earned his first Purple Heart when he was grazed by shrapnel while carrying flamethrower ammunition to the front lines. In that six-week battle, while investigating some random fire shootings, Douglas was shot at as he uncovered a two-foot-wide cave. He then killed the Japanese soldier inside at which point he wondered whether his enemy might be an economics professor from the University of Tokyo.

Shortly after returning to Pavuvu, Douglas received notice that his wife, Emily Taft Douglas, had won the election for Illinois&#x27;s at-large congressional district.

A few months later, during the Battle of Okinawa, Douglas earned his second Purple Heart. A volunteer rifleman in an infantry platoon, he was helping to carry wounded from 3rd Battalion 5th Marines along the Naha-Shuri line when a burst of machine gun fire tore through his left arm, severing the main nerve and leaving it permanently disabled.

After a thirteen-month stay in the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda, Maryland, Douglas was given an honorable discharge as a lieutenant colonel with full disability pay.

== Return to civilian life ==
After Douglas left the service he returned to teach at the University of Chicago around 1946. In 1947 he was awarded the highest honor in the economics profession when he was elected president of the American Economic Association. But soon Douglas found himself at odds with the faculty at Chicago, stating, &quot;... I was disconcerted to find that the economic and political conservatives had acquired almost complete dominance over my department and taught that market decisions were always right and profit values the supreme ones ... If I stayed, it would be in an unfriendly environment.&quot; Unhappy with the situation at the university, Paul turned his attention to Illinois politics.

== Senate campaign ==

While Douglas had been serving in the Marines, his wife, Emily, had been nominated to run against isolationist Republican Congressman Stephen A. Day, who had succeeded McKeough. Although she had defeated Day in the 1944 election, a Republican upsurge had unseated her in 1946, the same year that Douglas left the Marines.

Deciding to enter politics once again, Douglas let it be generally known that he wished to seek the office of Governor of Illinois in 1948. Cook County machine boss Jacob Arvey, however, had a different plan. At the time, several scandals had broken out over the machine&#x27;s activities, and Arvey decided that Douglas, a scholar and war hero with a reputation for incorruptibility, would be the perfect nominee to run against Senator Brooks. Since Brooks was hugely popular in the state and had a large campaign warchest, Arvey decided that there was no danger of Douglas winning. The top two thirds of the Illinois Democratic slate for the 1948 election then became Paul Douglas for senator and Adlai Stevenson for governor.

At the outset of the campaign, Douglas&#x27; chances looked slim. As a delegate to the 1948 Democratic National Convention, he had tried to draft General Dwight D. Eisenhower for president, calling President Harry S. Truman &quot;incompetent.&quot;

Douglas, however, proved to be a tenacious campaigner. He stumped across the state in a Jeep station wagon for the Marshall Plan, civil rights, repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act, more public housing, and more social security programs. During six months of non-stop campaigning, he traveled more than around the state and delivered more than 1,100 speeches. When Senator Brooks refused to debate him, Douglas debated an empty chair, switching from seat to seat as he provided both his and Brooks&#x27; answers.

On Election Day, Douglas won an upset victory, taking 55 percent of the vote and defeating the incumbent by a margin of more than 407,000 votes. Stevenson won the race for governor by a wide margin, but there was no coattails effect from president to senator to governor, as President Truman, campaigning for re-election, won the state by a slim 33,600 votes.

== Senator ==

As senator, Douglas soon earned a reputation as an unconventional liberal, concerned as much with fiscal discipline as with passing the Fair Deal. He was also a passionate crusader for civil rights (Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. described him as &quot;the greatest of all the Senators&quot;). At the opening of the 85th United States Congress in January 1957, a session that would see the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1957 in September, Douglas was the only senator to defy custom and vote against the confirmation of segregationist James Eastland as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

Douglas also earned fame as an opponent of pork barrel spending. Early in his first term, he grabbed headlines when, magnifying glass and atlas in hand, he strode to the Senate floor and, referring to a pork barrel project for the dredging of the Josias river in Maine, defied anyone to find the river in the atlas. When Maine&#x27;s Owen Brewster objected and pointed out the millions of dollars in pork going to Illinois, Douglas offered to cut his state&#x27;s share by 40%.

Upon joining the Senate, Douglas was appointed a member of the Joint Economic Committee. In that capacity, in the late-1940s and the early-1950s, he emerged as the central figure in the famous accord between the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury which provided the Federal Reserve with its independence from the Treasury, an independence that has lasted until the present day. Prior to the accord, the Federal Reserve’s policy rates were determined by the Treasury. His criticisms of the dependency of the Federal Reserve on the Treasury led to his picture appearing on the cover of Time magazine on January 22, 1951. A profile of him in that issue was entitled “The Making of a Maverick.” Subsequently, as chair of the Joint Economic Committee, he led a series of hard-hitting investigations into fiscal mismanagement in government. In 1952 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.

As the 1952 presidential election approached, a groundswell of support arose for a Douglas candidacy for president. The National Editorial Association ranked him the second-most-qualified man, after Truman, to receive the Democratic presidential nomination, and a poll of 46 Democratic insiders revealed him to be a favorite for the nomination if Truman stepped aside.

Douglas, however, refused to be considered as a candidate for president, instead backing the candidacy of Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee, a folksy, coonskin cap-wearing populist who had become famous for his televised investigations into organized crime. Douglas stumped across the country for Kefauver and stood next to him at the 1952 Democratic National Convention when Kefauver was defeated by Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson II. Four years later, in 1956, he remained publicly neutral, feeling that openly opposing Stevenson&#x27;s drive for the nomination and supporting Kefauver would damage his standing with his state party.

In addition to his battles for equal rights for African Americans and less pork barrel spending, Douglas was also known for his fights for environmental protection, public housing, and truth in lending laws. He opposed real estate redlining but was forced to allow a 1949 provision in a public housing bill making it possible for suburbs to reject low-income housing. He also authored the Consumer Credit Protection Act, a bill that forced lenders to state the terms of a loan in plain language and restricted the ability of lenders to discriminate on the basis of gender, race, or income. Although the bill was not passed during his term of office, it became law in 1968.

As a believer in Georgist economics, Douglas regretting not being able to do more to advance land value tax while in the Senate. Douglas told Mason Gaffney that he even regretted leaving local politics, where he saw more opportunity to implement Georgist ideas. In his memoirs, Douglas perhaps jokingly asked Saint Paul to forgive him for his silence in the Senate on what he considered to be the important land values problem.

Unlike some other liberals, Douglas was an opponent of a national health insurance program, claiming the Wagner-Murray-Dingell bill supported by President Harry Truman went too far.

Douglas was an ardent supporter of the disproven cancer drug Krebiozen, and in the early 1960s sponsored senate hearings in support of the discredited treatment.

== Defeat and retirement ==
During the 1966 election, Douglas, then 74, ran for a fourth term in office against Republican Charles H. Percy, a wealthy businessman and former student of his. A confluence of events, including Douglas&#x27;s age and sympathy for Percy over the then-recent and presently still unsolved murder of his daughter, Valerie, caused Douglas to lose the election in an upset.

After losing his seat in the Senate, Douglas taught at the New School, chaired a commission on housing, and wrote books, including an autobiography, &quot;In the Fullness of Time&quot;.

In the early 1970s, he had a stroke and withdrew from public life. On September 24, 1976, he died at his home. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in Jackson Park near the University of Chicago.

== Memorial ==
A memorial marker at the Marine Corps training base at Parris Island reads:
From 1986 to 1997, the U.S. Department of Education awarded the Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarship in Douglas&#x27;s honor.

In 1992 the University of Illinois, Institute of Government and Public Affairs established the Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government as part of the celebration of the senator&#x27;s 100th birthday, and in recognition of his outstanding service to the nation.

The Paul Douglas Forest Preserve in Hoffman Estates, Illinois is named for him.

== Awards and honors ==

Douglas was entitled to campaign participation credit (&quot;battle stars&quot;) for Capture and Occupation of the Southern Palau Islands (Peleliu), and Assault and Occupation of Okinawa Gunto

Douglas was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950 and the American Philosophical Society in 1952.

<doc id="302686" wikidata="Q159976" url="?curid=302686" title="Joseph Joachim">
<text>Joseph Joachim (28 June 1831 – 15 August 1907) was a Hungarian violinist, conductor, composer and teacher who made an international career, based in Hanover and Berlin. A close collaborator of Johannes Brahms, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant violinists of the 19th century.

Joachim studied violin early, beginning in Buda at age five, then in Vienna and Leipzig. He made his debut in London in 1844, playing Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Concerto, with Felix Mendelssohn conducting. He returned to London many times throughout life. After years of teaching at the Leipzig Conservatory and playing as principal violinist of the Gewandhausorchester, he moved to Weimar in 1848, where Franz Liszt established cultural life. From 1852, Joachim served at the court of Hanover, playing principal violin in the opera and conducting concerts, with months of free time in summer for concert tours. In 1853, he was invited by Robert Schumann to the Lower Rhine Music Festival, where he met Clara Schumann and Brahms, with whom he performed for years to come. In 1879, he premiered Brahms&#x27; violin concerto with Brahms as conductor. He married Amalie, an opera singer, in 1863, who gave up her career; the couple had six children.

Joachim quit service in Hanover in 1865, and the family moved to Berlin, where he was entrusted with founding and directing a new department at the Royal Conservatory, for performing music. He formed a string quartet, and kept performing chamber music on tours. His playing was recorded in 1903.

==Life==

===Origins===

Joachim was born in Köpcsény, Moson County, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Kittsee in Burgenland, Austria). He was the seventh of eight children born to Julius, a wool merchant, and Fanny Joachim, who were of Hungarian-Jewish origin. He spent his childhood as a member of the Köpcsény Kehilla (Jewish community), one of Hungary&#x27;s prominent Siebengemeinden (&#x27;Seven Communities&#x27;) under the protectorate of the Esterházy family. He was a first cousin of Fanny Wittgenstein, née Figdor, the mother of Karl Wittgenstein and the grandmother of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and the pianist Paul Wittgenstein. His niece Maud Joachim (through his brother Henry) was one of the first British suffragettes to go on hunger strike in prison in protest at not being treated as a political prisoner.

===Early career===
In 1833 his family moved to Pest, which in 1873 was united with Buda and Óbuda to form Budapest. There from 1836 (age 5) he studied violin with the Polish violinist Stanisław Serwaczyński, the concertmaster of the opera in Pest, said to be the best violinist in Pest. Although Joachim&#x27;s parents were &quot;not particularly well off&quot;, they had been well advised to choose not just an &quot;ordinary&quot; violin teacher. Joachim&#x27;s first public performance was 17 March 1839 when he was of age 7. (Serwaczyński later moved back to Lublin, Poland, where he taught Wieniawski.) In 1839, Joachim continued his studies at the Vienna Conservatory (briefly with Miska Hauser and Georg Hellmesberger, Sr.; finally – and most significantly – with Joseph Böhm, who introduced him to the world of chamber music). In 1843 he was taken by his cousin, Fanny Figdor, who later married &quot;a Leipzig merchant&quot; named Wittgenstein, to live and study in Leipzig. In the journal &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot; Robert Schumann was highly enthusiastic about Felix Mendelssohn, on which Moser writes &quot;Only in Haydn&#x27;s admiration for Mozart does the history of music know a parallel case of such ungrudging veneration of one great artist for his equal.&quot; in 1835, Mendelssohn had become director of the Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestra. In 1843 Joachim became a protégé of Mendelssohn, who arranged for him to study theory and composition with Moritz Hauptmann and violin with Ferdinand David. In his début performance in the Gewandhaus Joachim played the &quot;Otello Fantasy&quot; by Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst.

====London Philharmonic debut, Beethoven Violin Concerto====
On 27 May 1844 Joachim, not quite 13, in his London debut with Mendelssohn conducting at a concert of the Philharmonic Society, played the solo part in Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Concerto. This was a triumph in several respects, as described by R. W. Eshbach. The Philharmonic had a policy against performers so young, but an exception was made after auditions persuaded gatherings of distinguished musicians and music lovers that Joachim had mature capabilities. Despite Beethoven&#x27;s recognition as one of the greatest composers, and the ranking nowadays of his violin concerto as among the greatest few, it was far from being so ranked before Joachim&#x27;s performance. Ludwig Spohr had harshly criticized it, and after the London premiere by violinist Edward Eliason, a critic had said it &quot;might have been written by any third or fourth rate composer.&quot; But Joachim was very well prepared to play Beethoven&#x27;s concerto, having written his own cadenzas for it and memorized the piece. The audience anticipated great things, having got word from the rehearsal, and so, Mendelssohn wrote, &quot;frenetic applause began&quot; as soon as Joachim stepped in front of the orchestra. The beginning was applauded still more, and &quot;cheers of the audience accompanied every ... part of the concerto.&quot; Reviewers also had high praise. One for &#x27;The Musical World&#x27; wrote &quot;The greatest violinists hold this concerto in awe ... Young Joachim ... attacked it with the vigour and determination of the most accomplished artist ... no master could have read it better,&quot; and the two cadenzas, written by Joachim, were &quot;tremendous feats ... ingeniously composed&quot;. Another reviewer, for the &#x27;Illustrated London News&#x27;, wrote that Joachim &quot;is perhaps the first violin player, not only of his age, but of his siècle&quot; [century]. &quot;He performed Beethoven&#x27;s solitary concerto, which we have heard all the great performers of the last twenty years attempt, and invariably fail in ... its performance was an eloquent vindication of the master-spirit who imagined it.&quot; A third reviewer, for the &#x27;Morning Post&#x27;, wrote that the concerto &quot;has been generally regarded by violin-players as not a proper and effective development of the powers of their instrument&quot; but that Joachim&#x27;s performance &quot;is beyond all praise, and defies all description&quot; and &quot;was altogether unprecedented.&quot; Joachim remained a favorite with the English public for the rest of his career. He visited England in each year 1858, 1859, 1862 largely at the behest of his friend William Sterndale Bennett, and for several decades thereafter.

====Beethoven string quartets====
Moser (p. 28 ff.) writes &quot;After the appearance of the six String Quartets (Op. 18) Beethoven had complete command of the field of chamber-music&quot;, although in the later quartets he &quot;makes many exacting demands&quot; of string players. Moser (p. 29) further writes that &quot;at the time of Beethoven&#x27;s death&quot;, such people as Spohr and Hauptmann did not necessarily esteem the late quartets above the earliest ones. Moser, p. 30 writes that in Vienna &quot;the public showed a marked hostility toward&quot; the late quartets. But Joachim&#x27;s teacher Böhm had an appreciation of the late quartets, which he communicated to Joachim. At the age of 18, &quot;in the whole of Germany&quot; Joachim had no equal, either in the rendering of Bach or in the concertos of Beethoven and Mendelssohn; while as quartet player, &quot;he had no cause to fear rivalry.&quot;

===Maturity===
Following Mendelssohn&#x27;s death in 1847, Joachim stayed briefly in Leipzig, teaching at the Conservatorium and playing on the first desk of the Gewandhaus Orchestra with Ferdinand David, whom Mendelssohn had appointed concertmaster on taking up the conductorship in 1835.

====Weimar, Liszt; then Hanover====
In 1848, the pianist and composer Franz Liszt took up residence in Weimar, where Goethe and Schiller had lived. Liszt was determined to re-establish the town&#x27;s reputation as the Athens of Germany. There, he gathered a circle of young avant-garde disciples, vocally opposed to the conservatism of the Leipzig circle. Joachim was amongst the first of these. He served Liszt as concertmaster, and for several years enthusiastically embraced the new &quot;psychological music,&quot; as he called it. In 1852 he moved to Hanover, at the same time dissociating himself from the musical ideals of the &#x27;New German School&#x27; (Liszt, Richard Wagner, Hector Berlioz, and their followers, as defined by journalist Franz Brendel). &quot;The worship of Wagner&#x27;s music permeating musical taste in Weimar was to Joachim inordinate and unacceptable.&quot; Joachim&#x27;s break with Liszt became final in August 1857, when he wrote to his former mentor: &quot;I am completely out of sympathy with your music; it contradicts everything which from early youth I have taken as mental nourishment from the spirit of our great masters.&quot; Hanover &quot;was then an independent kingdom, later to be absorbed in the German empire.&quot; King Georg of Hanover was totally blind and very fond of music; he paid Joachim a good salary and gave him considerable freedom. Joachim&#x27;s duties in Hanover included playing the main violin part in opera performances and that or conducting state concerts. He had five summer months off, in which he made concert tours around Europe. In March 1853 he sent to Liszt a copy of the Overture to Hamlet he had recently composed.

===The Schumanns, Brahms; Berlin===
Also in 1853, a committee headed by Schumann invited Joachim to the Lower Rhine Music Festival. At the Festival, Joachim again soloed in the Beethoven violin concerto. His success made him, it is said, &quot;the most renowned artist of Germany&quot;. Robert Schumann and his wife Clara were deeply impressed, and formed a &quot;close connection&quot; with Joachim. Joachim met the then publicly unknown 20-year-old Brahms, and wrote of him that his playing &quot;shows the intense fire...which predicts the artist&quot; and &quot;his compositions already betoken such power as I have seen in no other musician of his age&quot;. Joachim strongly recommended Brahms to Robert. Brahms was received by the Schumanns with great enthusiasm. After Robert&#x27;s mental breakdown in 1854 and death in 1856, Joachim, Clara, and Brahms remained lifelong friends and shared musical views. Joachim&#x27;s performing style with the violin, like Clara&#x27;s at the piano, is said to have been &quot;restrained, pure, antivirtuosic, expressing the music rather than the performer.&quot;

In December 1854, Joachim visited Robert at the Endenich asylum where he had been since February, Joachim being his first visitor.
Early on, Brahms already played and composed for the piano, which &quot;he had mastered in a supreme fashion&quot;, but he felt deficient in orchestration. In 1854 he began composing what was to become his first piano concerto, his first orchestral piece. He sent a score of the first movement to Joachim, requesting his advice. After getting Joachim&#x27;s response, Brahms wrote to him &quot;A thousand thanks for having studied the first movement in such a sympathetic and careful manner. I have learned a great deal from your remarks. As a musician I really have no greater wish than to have more talent so that I can learn still more from such a friend.&quot; Later in the composition of the concerto, which took four years, Brahms wrote to Joachim &quot;I am sending you the rondo once more. And just like the last time, I beg for some really severe criticism.&quot; The final manuscript of the concerto &quot;shows many alterations in the handwriting of Joachim&quot;.
Joachim&#x27;s time in Hanover was his most prolific period of composition. Then and during the rest of his career, he frequently performed with Clara Schumann. For example, in October–November 1857 they took a recital tour together to Dresden, Leipzig, and Munich. St. James&#x27;s Hall, London, which opened in 1858, hosted a series of &quot;Popular Concerts&quot; of chamber music, of which programmes from 1867 through 1904 are preserved. Joachim appears a great many times. He visited London each year from 1866 on. In March 1898 and in 1901–1904 Joachim appeared in his own quartet of players, but otherwise far more often he appeared with resident Popular Concerts artists Louis Ries, second violin, J. B. Zerbini, first viola, and Alfredo Piatti, first cello, reputed to be &quot;one of the most celebrated cellists&quot; of the time. George Bernard Shaw wrote that the Popular Concerts had helped greatly to spread and enlighten musical taste in England. Joachim had been a mainstay of the chamber music Popular Concerts.

At 18 of the Popular Concerts at least, Clara Schumann performed along with Joachim, Zerbini and Piatti, presumably playing piano quartets (without second violin), or sometimes piano trios (for piano, violin, and cello). (The programs of those concerts very likely also included string quartets in which she of course did not play, as Ries is also listed.) A favorite piece of Clara&#x27;s was Brahms&#x27;s Piano Quartet in A major. She wrote to Brahms 27 February 1882 from London that the piece had received &quot;much applause&quot;. About a performance of it in Liverpool 11 February she had written in her diary that it was &quot;warmly received, much to my surprise as the public here is far less receptive than that in London.&quot; In January 1867 there had been a tour to Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland, by Joachim, Clara, her oldest daughter Marie, Ries, Zerbini, Piatti, two English sisters &quot;Miss Pyne,&quot; one a singer, and a Mr. Saunders who managed all the arrangements. Marie Schumann wrote home from Manchester that in Edinburgh Clara &quot;was received with tempestuous applause and had to give an encore, so had Joachim. Piatti, too, is always tremendously liked.&quot;

Joachim had extensive correspondence with both Clara and Brahms, as Brahms greatly valued Joachim&#x27;s opinion of his new compositions. In 1860 Brahms and Joachim jointly wrote a manifesto against the &quot;progressive&quot; music of the &#x27;New German&#x27; School, in reaction to the polemics of Brendel&#x27;s &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot;. This manifesto, a volley in the War of the Romantics, had originally few (four) signers (more later) and met with a mixed reception, being heavily derided by followers of Wagner.
On 10 May 1863 Joachim married the contralto Amalie Schneeweiss (stage name: Amalie Weiss) (1839–99). Amalie gave up her own promising career as an opera singer and gave birth to six children. She continued to perform in oratorios and to give lieder recitals. In 1865 Joachim quit the service of the King of Hanover in protest, when the Intendant (artistic director) of the Opera refused to advance one of the orchestral players (Jakob Grün) because of the latter&#x27;s Jewish birth. In 1866, as a result of the Austro-Prussian war, in which Prussia and its capital Berlin became the dominant German state and city, Joachim moved to Berlin, where he was invited to help found, and to become the first director of, a new department of the Royal Academy of Music, concerned with musical performance and called the Hochschule für ausübende Tonkunst.

On Good Friday, 10 April 1868, Joachim and his wife joined their friend, Johannes Brahms, in the celebration of one of Brahms&#x27; greatest triumphs, the first complete performance of his &quot;German Requiem&quot; at the Bremen Cathedral. Amalie Joachim sang &quot;I Know that My Redeemer Liveth&quot; and Joseph Joachim played Robert Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Abendlied&quot;. It was a glorious occasion, after which about 100 of the composer&#x27;s friends, the Joachims, Clara Schumann, Albert Dietrich and his wife, Max Bruch, and others gathered at the Bremen Rathskeller.
In 1869, the Joachim String Quartet was formed, which quickly gained a reputation as Europe&#x27;s finest. It continued to perform until Joachim&#x27;s death in 1907. The first personnel of the quartet were: Ernst Schiever (1869–1871) a pupil of Joachim, Heinrich de Ahna (1871–1892), and Wilhelm Muller (1869–1879). Schiever resigned after their second season with de Ahna taking the second violin part and Eduard Rappoldi (1871–1877) on viola. Later members of the Quartet were Johann Kruse (1892–1897) followed by Karel Halíř (2nd violin) from 1897 on; Emanuel Wirth (viola) from 1877 on (occasionally replaced by Karl Klingler); and Robert Hausmann (cello), from 1879 on. 

In 1878 while writing his violin concerto, Brahms consulted Joachim, who &quot;freely gave him encouragement and technical advice&quot;. Brahms asked Joachim to write the cadenza for the concerto, as he did.

In 1884, Joachim and his wife separated after he became convinced that she was having an affair with the publisher Fritz Simrock. Brahms, certain that Joachim&#x27;s suspicions were groundless, wrote a sympathetic letter to Amalie, which she later produced as evidence in Joachim&#x27;s divorce proceeding against her. This led to a cooling of Brahms&#x27; and Joachim&#x27;s friendship, which was not restored until some years later, when Brahms composed the Double Concerto in A minor for violin and cello, Op. 102, 1887, as a peace offering to his old friend. It was co-dedicated to the first performers, Joachim and Robert Hausmann.

In late 1895 both Brahms and Joachim were present at the opening of the new Tonhalle at Zürich, Switzerland; Brahms conducted and Joachim was assistant conductor. But in April, two years later, Joachim was to lose forever this revered friend, as Johannes Brahms died at the age of 64 at Vienna. At Meiningen, in December 1899, it was Joachim who made the speech when a statue to Brahms was unveiled.

===Honors and Jubilees===
In March 1877, Joachim received an honorary Doctorate of Music from Cambridge University. For the occasion he presented his Overture in honor of Kleist, Op. 13. Near the 50th anniversary of Joachim&#x27;s debut recital, he was honored by &quot;friends and admirers in England&quot; on 16 April 1889 who presented him with &quot;an exceptionally fine&quot; violin made in 1715 by Antonio Stradivari, called &quot;Il Cremonese&quot;. About ten years later, for the sixtieth jubilee, a concert in honor of Joachim was given by his former students of violin and viola playing and cellists who had studied quartet playing with him, on 22 April 1899. The total of some 140 string players was impressive, as were their instruments (made by Stradivari, Guarneri, Bergonzi, Amati, etc.). An honor such as that concert &quot;had been accorded to no other musician during his lifetime&quot;.

During 1899, Joachim was invited to become president of the newly established Oxford &amp; Cambridge Musical Club in London. He remained club president until his death.

In Berlin, on 17 August 1903, Joachim recorded five sides for The Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Ltd (G&amp;T), which remain a fascinating and valuable source of information about 19th-century styles of violin playing. He is the earliest violinist of distinction known to have recorded, only to be followed soon thereafter when Sarasate made some recordings the following year.

Joachim&#x27;s portrait was twice painted by Philip de László. A portrait of Joachim was painted by John Singer Sargent and presented to him at the 1904 &quot;Diamond Jubilee&quot; celebration of his sixtieth anniversary of his first appearance in London. 
Joachim remained in Berlin until his death in 1907.

At his 75th birthday observance in June 1906, Joachim said The Germans have four violin concertos. The greatest, most uncompromising is Beethoven&#x27;s. The one by Brahms vies with it in seriousness. The richest, the most seductive, was written by Max Bruch. But the most inward, the heart&#x27;s jewel, is Mendelssohn&#x27;s.

Bruch wrote three violin concertos. Joachim was presumably referring to his Concerto No. 1, which is the most well-known and frequently performed. Joachim had assisted Bruch in revising that concerto.

==Repertoire==

Among the most notable of Joachim&#x27;s achievements were his revival of Beethoven&#x27;s violin concerto already mentioned, the revival of Bach&#x27;s Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin, BWV 1001–1006, especially the Chaconne from the Partita No. 2, BWV 1004, and of Beethoven&#x27;s late string quartets. Joachim was the second violinist, after Ferdinand David, to play Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto in E minor, which he studied with the composer. Joachim played a pivotal role in the career of Brahms, and remained a tireless advocate of Brahms&#x27;s compositions through all the vicissitudes of their friendship. He conducted the English premiere of Brahms&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 in C minor at Cambridge on 8 March 1877, on the same day that he received a
D. Mus. degree there (Brahms had declined an invitation to go to England himself).

A number of Joachim&#x27;s composer colleagues, including Schumann, Brahms, Bruch, and Dvořák, composed concerti with Joachim in mind, many of which entered the standard repertory. Nevertheless, Joachim&#x27;s solo repertoire remained relatively restricted. He never performed Schumann&#x27;s Violin Concerto in D minor, which Schumann wrote especially for him, or Dvořák&#x27;s Violin Concerto in A minor, although Dvořák had earnestly solicited his advice about the piece, dedicated it to him, and would have liked him to premiere it. The most unusual work written for Joachim was the &quot;F-A-E Sonata&quot;, a collaboration between Schumann, Brahms, and Albert Dietrich, based upon the initials of Joachim&#x27;s motto, &quot;Frei aber Einsam&quot; (which can be translated as &quot;free but lonely&quot;, &quot;free but alone&quot;, or &quot;free but solitary&quot;). Although the sonata is rarely performed in its entirety, the third movement, the &quot;Scherzo in C minor&quot;, composed by Brahms, is still frequently played today.
==Compositions==
Joachim&#x27;s own compositions are less well known. He gave opus numbers to 14 compositions and composed about an equal number of pieces without opus numbers. Among his compositions are various works for the violin (including three concerti) and overtures to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Henry IV&quot;. He also wrote cadenzas for a number of other composers&#x27; concerti (including the Beethoven and Brahms concerti). His most highly regarded composition is his &quot;Hungarian concerto&quot; (Violin Concerto No 2 in D minor, Op. 11).
===List of compositions===
Fuller-Maitland, p. 56, lists the 14 pieces with opus numbers, not necessarily with the same details as below. On p. 57 he lists 6 of the 14 pieces given here as WoO, plus the orchestration of the Schubert Grand Duo and the Beethoven and Brahms concerto cadenzas.

Original pressings are single-sided and have a flat red G&amp;T label. Later reeditions have a black G&amp;T label (or, from 1909, from the &#x27;His Master&#x27;s Voice&#x27; record label), and those made for the German market are double-sided.

A letter preserved in the EMI archives records the stringent conditions Joachim expected for the publicity for his recordings: sensational adverts were to be avoided, with no comparisons between his art and that of other violinists. The letter also stated that &quot;it was only with the greatest difficulty that Professor Joachim was induced to play&quot;.

==Joachim&#x27;s instruments==
Most, but not all, of the many violins (and two violas) Joachim is said to have had during his career are shown on the website of Tarisio Auctions, cozio.com. Further information, in German, is in the article by Kamlah (2013). 
* His first (full-size) violin was a Guarneri Filius Andreae 1703, which he gave to Felix Schumann after he acquired his first Stradivarius.
* A violin, the &quot;ex-Joachim&quot; Stradivarius of 1715 is currently held by the Collezione Civica del Comune di Cremona. It was presented to Joachim on the occasion of his Jubilee celebration in 1889.
* The Ex Joachim, Joseph Vieland Viola by Gasparo da Salò, Brescia, before 1609 is held by the Shrine to Music No. 3368.
* A Johannes Theodorus Cuypers anno 1807 was bought by Joachim in the mid 19th century and taken on tour throughout Europe. There is also evidence that the instrument was played by Joachim in a recital in Paris a half century later, in 1895. The same instrument was also played by Fritz Kreisler in a 1955 Carnegie Hall concert.

==Cultural references==
The English poet Robert Bridges wrote a sonnet about Joachim in his first major work of poetry &quot;The Growth of Love&quot;.

<doc id="302687" wikidata="Q10364247" url="?curid=302687" title="Rhomboid">
<text>Traditionally, in two-dimensional geometry, a rhomboid is a parallelogram in which adjacent sides are of unequal lengths and angles are non-right angled. 

The terms &quot;rhomboid&quot; and &quot;parallelogram&quot; are often erroneously conflated with each other (i.e, when most people refer to a &quot;parallelogram&quot; they almost always mean a rhomboid, a specific subtype of parallelogram); however, while all rhomboids are parallelograms, not all parallelograms are rhomboids.

A parallelogram with sides of equal length (equilateral) is called a &quot;rhombus&quot; but not a rhomboid.
A parallelogram with right angled corners is a &quot;rectangle&quot; but not a rhomboid. 
A parallelogram is a rhomboid if it is neither a rhombus nor a rectangle.

==History==
Euclid introduced the term in his &quot;Elements&quot; in Book I, Definition 22,
Euclid never used the definition of rhomboid again and introduced the word parallelogram in Proposition 34 of Book I; &quot;In parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another, and the diameter bisects the areas.&quot; Heath suggests that rhomboid was an older term already in use.

==Symmetries==
The rhomboid has no line of symmetry, but it has rotational symmetry of order 2.

==Occurrence==

===In biology===
In biology, rhomboid may describe a geometric rhomboid (e.g. the rhomboid muscles) or a bilaterally-symmetrical kite-shaped or diamond-shaped outline, as in leaves or cephalopod fins.

===In medicine===
In a type of arthritis called pseudogout, crystals of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate accumulate in the joint, causing inflammation. Aspiration of the joint fluid reveals rhomboid-shaped crystals under a microscope.

In anatomy, rhomboid-shaped muscles include the rhomboid major muscle and the rhomboid minor muscle.

<doc id="302691" wikidata="Q311115" url="?curid=302691" title="Henri Victor Regnault">
<text>Henri Victor Regnault (21 July 1810 – 19 January 1878) was a French chemist and physicist best known for his careful measurements of the thermal properties of gases. He was an early thermodynamicist and was mentor to William Thomson in the late 1840s. He never used his first given name, and was known throughout his lifetime as Victor Regnault.

==Biography==
Born in Aix-la-Chapelle in 1810 (modern Aachen, Germany and at that time under French rule), he moved to Paris at the age of eight, following the death of his parents. There, he worked for an upholstery firm until he was eighteen. In 1830, he was admitted to the École Polytechnique, and in 1832 he graduated from the École des mines.

Working under Justus von Liebig at Gießen, Regnault distinguished himself in the nascent field of organic chemistry by synthesizing several chlorinated hydrocarbons (e.g. vinyl chloride in 1835, dichloromethane and perchloroethylene in 1839, 1,1,1-Trichloroethane in 1838 or 1840), and he was appointed professor of chemistry at the University of Lyon. In 1840, he was appointed the chair of chemistry of the École Polytechnique, and in 1841, he became a professor of physics in the Collège de France.

Beginning in 1843, he began compiling extensive numerical tables on the properties of steam. These were published in 1847, and inspired Charles Algernon Parsons to develop the steam turbine. Regnault received the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society of London and appointment as Chief Engineer of Mines. In 1851 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1854 he was appointed director of the porcelain works at Sèvres, the &quot;Manufacture nationale de Sèvres&quot;. In 1855, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

At Sèvres, he continued work on the thermal properties of matter. He designed sensitive thermometers, hygrometers, hypsometers and calorimeters, and measured the specific heats of many substances and the coefficient of thermal expansion of gases. In the course of this work, he discovered that not all gases expand equally when heated and that Boyle&#x27;s law is only an approximation, especially at temperatures near a substance&#x27;s boiling point.

Regnault was also an avid amateur photographer. He introduced the use of pyrogallic acid as a developing agent, and was one of the first photographers to use paper negatives. In 1854, he became the founding president of the Société française de photographie.

In 1871, his laboratory at Sèvres was destroyed and his son Alex-Georges-Henri Regnault killed, both as a result of the Franco-Prussian War. He retired from science the next year, never recovering from these losses.

==Legacy==
The crater Regnault on the Moon is named after Regnault, and his name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. Some have suggested that the symbol &quot;R&quot; for the ideal gas constant is also named after him.

He was the first president of Société française de photographie.

The French &quot;Regnault&quot;, built between 1913 and 1924 was named for him.

<doc id="302693" wikidata="Q11861530" url="?curid=302693" title="Illusory continuity of tones">
<text>The illusory continuity of tones is the auditory illusion caused when a tone is interrupted for a short time, during which a narrow band of noise is played. The noise has to be of a sufficiently high level to effectively mask the gap, unless it is a gap transfer illusion. Whether the tone is of constant, rising or decreasing pitch, the ear perceives the tone as continuous if the discontinuity is masked by noise. Because the human ear is very sensitive to sudden changes, however, it is necessary for the success of the illusion that the amplitude of the tone in the region of the discontinuity not decrease or increase too abruptly. While the inner mechanisms of this illusion is not well understood, there is evidence that supports activation of primarily the auditory cortex is present.

== Relation to Other Auditory Illusions ==

Illusory continuity is antagonistic with illusory discontinuity. While illusory continuity restores perceptual continuity of obscured sounds, illusory discontinuity disrupts the perception even if the sound is indeed continuous. Listeners strongly susceptible to illusory discontinuity do not perceive illusory auditory continuity.

== Requirements of the Illusion ==
Auditory induction in the brain is used to create a sense of illusory continuity, when a background noise is interrupted by a foreground noise. Even when the foreground noise is completely removed and replaced, listeners still report being able to hear the foreground sound that was removed. This is true with speech, which is done using prior knowledge of speech patterns from mere exposure. However, the neural networks often show no sign of interruption when this occurs. Even when the sound is completely removed and replaced, the neural networks show no sign of the sound being interrupted. There does seem to be limitations to this, however, as the sound that masks the original foreground stimulus needs to have appropriate composition and intensity. The illusion is dependent on all of the factors involved with the illusion, not just the individual components of the illusion. The foreground and background noise must both be fitting to the criteria required for this illusion, and not just one or the other. 

Essentially, a sound in the foreground that is interrupted without the gap being filled by some other background noise is perceived is discontinuous, but if another sound is present during this gap, the sound is perceived as continuous. This effect is dependent on the duration, loudness, and bandwidth of the noise, with loud, short gap having the strongest illusory effect. If the gap is too long or the occluding sound too short, the illusory effect will wear off.

== The Brain and the Illusion ==
Animal models suggest that the auditory cortex is the primary cause for this auditory illusion. However, it has been shown that the human brainstem also supports auditory continuity even before the auditory cortex is involved.

Other areas of the brain that are involved in this illusion are the left posterior angular gyrus, superior temporal sulcus, Broca&#x27;s area, and the anterior insula. These brain regions &quot;repair&quot; the lost sound using past experiences and context subconsciously, creating this illusion. The brain takes in the context that is given before the sound is obscured, and these areas of the brain work to &quot;fill in&quot; that gap with prior knowledge.

== The Gap Transfer Illusion ==
The gap transfer illusion is very similar to this illusion; it is where an ascending tone is interrupted by another descending tone, yet only the ascending tone is perceived when the two tones intersect. This occurs only when the crossing slides have the same slope, sound spectrum, intensity (or possibly slightly lower for descending tone), and sound pressure level. This illusion causes an illusion of two tones intersecting into one. This gap needs to be about 40 ms or less. This seems to be the only way that a soundless gap is perceived, usually an occluding sound must be present for the sound to have an illusory effect.

==Early life==
Jackman was born in Sydney, New South Wales, to Grace McNeil (née Greenwood) and Christopher John Jackman, a Cambridge-educated accountant. His parents were English and went to Australia in 1967 as part of the &quot;Ten Pound Poms&quot; immigration scheme. Thus, in addition to his Australian citizenship, Jackman holds British citizenship by virtue of being born to UK-born parents. One of his paternal great-grandfathers, Nicholas Isidor Bellas, was Greek, from the Ottoman Empire (now in Greece). His parents were devout Christians, having been converted by Evangelist Billy Graham after their marriage. Jackman has four older siblings and was the second of his parents&#x27; children to be born in Australia. He also has a younger half-sister, from his mother&#x27;s remarriage. His parents divorced when he was eight, and Jackman remained in Australia with his father and two brothers, while his mother moved back to England with Jackman&#x27;s two sisters. As a child, Jackman liked the outdoors, spending much time at the beach and on camping trips and school holidays all over Australia. He wanted to see the world, saying, &quot;I used to spend nights looking at atlases. I decided I wanted to be a chef on a plane. Because I&#x27;d been on a plane and there was food on board, I presumed there was a chef. I thought that would be an ideal job.&quot;

Jackman went to primary school at Pymble Public School and later attended the all-boys Knox Grammar School on Sydney&#x27;s Upper North Shore, where he starred in its production of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; in 1985 and became the school captain in 1986. He spent a gap year in 1987 working at Uppingham School in England as a Physical Education teacher. On his return, he studied at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating in 1991 with a BA in Communications. In his final year of university, he took a drama course to make up additional credits. The class did Václav Havel&#x27;s &quot;The Memorandum&quot; with Jackman as the lead. He later commented, &quot;In that week I felt more at home with those people than I did in the entire three years [at university]&quot;.

After obtaining his BA, Jackman completed the one-year course &quot;The Journey&quot; at the Actors&#x27; Centre in Sydney. About studying acting full-time, he stated, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t until I was 22 that I ever thought about my hobby being something I could make a living out of. As a boy, I&#x27;d always had an interest in theatre. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn&#x27;t what one did for a living. I got over that. I found the courage to stand up and say, &#x27;I want to do it&#x27;.&quot; After completing &quot;The Journey&quot;, he was offered a role on the popular soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; but turned it down to attend the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts of Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, from which he graduated in 1994.

Jackman has said he &quot;always loved acting but when I started at drama school I was like the dunce of the class. It just wasn&#x27;t coming right to me. Everyone was cooler, everyone seemed more likely to succeed, everyone seemed more natural at it and in retrospect, I think that is good. I think it is good to come from behind as an actor. I think it is good to go into an audition thinking, &#x27;Man I&#x27;ve got to be at my best to get this gig.&#x27;&quot;.

==Career==
===1995–1999: Early career in theatre===
On the night of his final Academy graduation performance, Jackman received a phone call offering him a role on &quot;Correlli&quot;: &quot;I was technically unemployed for thirteen seconds.&quot; &quot;Correlli&quot;, devised by Australian actress Denise Roberts, was a 10-part drama series on ABC, Jackman&#x27;s first major professional job, and where he met his future wife Deborra-Lee Furness. Jackman stated that &quot;Meeting my wife was the greatest thing to come out of it.&quot; The show lasted only one season. After &quot;Correlli&quot; Jackman went on the stage in Melbourne. In 1996, Jackman played Gaston in the local Walt Disney production of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, and Joe Gillis in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. During his stage musical career in Melbourne, he starred in the 1998 Midsumma festival cabaret production &quot;Summa Cabaret&quot;. He also hosted Melbourne&#x27;s Carols by Candlelight and Sydney&#x27;s Carols in the Domain. Jackman&#x27;s early film works include &quot;Erskineville Kings&quot; and &quot;Paperback Hero&quot; (1999), and his television work includes &quot;Law of the Land&quot;, &quot;Halifax f.p.&quot;, &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, and &quot;Banjo Paterson&#x27;s The Man from Snowy River&quot;.

Jackman became known outside Australia in 1998, when he played the leading role of Curly in the Royal National Theatre&#x27;s acclaimed stage production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, in London&#x27;s West End. The performance earned him an Olivier Award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical. Jackman said, &quot;I totally felt like it can&#x27;t get any better than this. On some level that production will be one of the highlights of my career.&quot; He also starred in the 1999 film version of the same stage musical, which has been screened in many countries.

===2000–2004: Breakthrough with Wolverine and the &quot;X-Men&quot;===
Jackman had his breakthrough role playing Wolverine in Bryan Singer&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000)—a superhero film based on the Marvel Comics team of the same name. Co-starring Patrick Stewart, James Marsden, Famke Janssen and Ian McKellen, the film tells the story of a group of mutants, whose superhuman powers make them distrusted by normal humans, but who fight to protect humans from villains. The role was originally written for Russell Crowe who instead suggested Jackman for the part. Jackman says that his wife advised him against taking on the role, as she found it &quot;ridiculous&quot;. He initially studied wolves to develop his character, as he thought that Wolverine alluded to wolves. &quot;X-Men&quot; was successful at the box-office, earning US$296 million. The role earned him a Saturn Award for Best Actor.

Wolverine was tough for Jackman to portray because he had few lines, but much emotion to convey in them. To prepare, he watched Clint Eastwood in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; movies and Mel Gibson in &quot;Mad Max 2&quot;. &quot;There were guys who had relatively little dialogue, like Wolverine had, but you knew and felt everything. I&#x27;m not normally one to copy, but I wanted to see how these guys achieved it.&quot; Jackman was adamant about doing his own stunts for the movie. &quot;We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of Mike Tyson fights, especially his early fights. There&#x27;s something about his style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine. I kept saying to the writers, &#x27;Don&#x27;t give me long, choreographed fights for the sake of it. Don&#x27;t make the fights pretty.&quot; Jackman also had to get used to wearing Wolverine&#x27;s claws. He said, &quot;Every day in my living room, I&#x27;d just walk around with those claws, to get used to them. I&#x27;ve got scars on one leg, punctures straight through the cheek, on my forehead. I&#x27;m a bit clumsy. I&#x27;m lucky I didn&#x27;t tell them that when I auditioned.&quot;
At , Jackman stands taller than Wolverine, who is said in the original comic book to be . Hence, the filmmakers were frequently forced to shoot Jackman at unusual angles or only from the waist up to make him appear shorter than he actually is, and his co-stars wore platform soles. Jackman was also required to add a great deal of muscle for the role, and in preparing for the fourth film in the series, he bench-pressed over 136 kg (300 lb).

Jackman reprised his role in 2003&#x27;s &quot;X2&quot;, 2006&#x27;s &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, and the 2009 prequel &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;, where Troye Sivan played the younger version of James Howlett. He also cameoed as Wolverine in 2011&#x27;s &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;. He returned for the role of Wolverine again in 2013&#x27;s &quot;The Wolverine&quot;, a stand-alone sequel taking place after the events of &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, and reprised the character in the 2014 sequel &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; and briefly in the 2016 follow-up &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot;. In 2015, Jackman announced that the 2017 sequel to &quot;The Wolverine&quot;, &quot;Logan&quot;, was the final time that he would play the role. It earned him the Guinness World Record of &quot;longest career as a live-action Marvel superhero&quot;, although this record has since been surpassed.

Jackman starred as Leopold in the 2001 romantic comedy film &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot;, a role for which he received a Best Actor Golden Globe nomination. Jackman plays a Victorian English duke who accidentally time-travels to 21st-century Manhattan, where he meets Kate (Meg Ryan), a cynical advertising executive. In 2001, Jackman also starred in the action/drama &quot;Swordfish&quot; with John Travolta and Halle Berry. This was the second time Jackman worked with Berry, and the two have worked together thrice more in the &quot;X-Men&quot; movies. He hosted an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2001.

In 2002, Jackman sang the role of Billy Bigelow in the musical &quot;Carousel&quot; in a special concert performance at Carnegie Hall with the Orchestra of St. Luke&#x27;s. In 2004, Jackman won the Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Musical for his 2003–2004 Broadway portrayal of Australian songwriter and performer Peter Allen in the hit musical &quot;The Boy from Oz&quot;, which he also performed in Australia in 2006. In addition, Jackman hosted the Tony Awards in 2003, 2004, and 2005, garnering positive reviews. His hosting of the 2004 Tony Awards earned him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Performer in a Variety, Musical or Comedy program.

After 2003&#x27;s &quot;X2&quot;, Jackman played the title role of monster killer Gabriel Van Helsing in the 2004 film &quot;Van Helsing&quot;. Jackman and the film were noted in Bruce A. McClelland&#x27;s book &quot;Slayers and Their Vampires: A Cultural History of Killing the Dead&quot;.

===2005–2007: Hollywood success===

Jackman was asked to consider taking on the role of James Bond before Daniel Craig was chosen to play the character, but turned it down due to other commitments. Speaking to the British Press Association in 2011, Jackman said: &quot;I was about to shoot X-Men 2 and Wolverine had become this thing in my life and I didn&#x27;t want to be doing two such iconic characters at once.&quot;

Alongside Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Scarlett Johansson, Jackman starred in &quot;The Prestige&quot; (2006), a mystery thriller from Christopher Nolan. Jackman portrayed Robert Angier, an aristocratic magician who builds up a rivalry with contemporary Alfred Borden (Bale) in an attempt to one-up each other in the art of deception. After reading the script, Jackman expressed interest in starring in the film, and Nolan believed that the actor had the qualities of the character. Jackman based his portrayal of Angier on 1950s-era American magician Channing Pollock. &quot;The Prestige&quot; was acclaimed and a box-office success.

Jackman portrayed three different characters in Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s science-fiction film &quot;The Fountain&quot;: Tommy Creo, a neuroscientist, who is torn between his wife, Izzi (Rachel Weisz), who is dying of a brain tumor, and his work at trying to cure her; Captain Tomas Creo, a Spanish conquistador in 1532 Seville; and a future astronaut, Tom, travelling to a golden nebula in an eco-spacecraft seeking to be reunited with Izzi. Jackman said &quot;The Fountain&quot; was his most difficult film thus far due to the physical and emotional demands of the part.

Jackman also starred in Woody Allen&#x27;s 2006 film &quot;Scoop&quot; opposite Scarlett Johansson. That year he also reprised the role of Wolverine in &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;. He rounded out 2006 with two animated films: &quot;Happy Feet&quot;, directed by George Miller, in which he voiced the part of Memphis, an emperor penguin (singing &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;); and &quot;Flushed Away&quot;, where Jackman supplied the voice of a rat named Roddy who ends up being flushed down a family&#x27;s toilet into the London sewer system (Jackman&#x27;s fourth film co-starring with Ian McKellen).

In 2007, Jackman produced and guest-starred in the television musical-dramedy series &quot;Viva Laughlin&quot;, which was cancelled by CBS after two episodes. In 2007, Jackman became the Patron of the Actors Centre Australia where he studied, and remains so.

===2008–2011: Return to Broadway===

In 2008, director Baz Luhrmann cast Jackman to replace Russell Crowe as the male lead in his much-publicised epic film, &quot;Australia&quot;, which co-starred Nicole Kidman. The movie was released in late November 2008 in Australia and the U.S. Jackman played a tough, independent cattle drover, who reluctantly helps an English noblewoman in her quest to save both her philandering husband&#x27;s Australian cattle station and the mixed race Aboriginal child she finds there. Of the movie, Jackman said, &quot;This is pretty much one of those roles that had me pinching myself all the way through the shoot. I got to shoot a big-budget, shamelessly old-fashioned romantic epic set against one of the most turbulent times in my native country&#x27;s history, while, at the same time, celebrating that country&#x27;s natural beauty, its people, its cultures... I&#x27;ll die a happy man knowing I&#x27;ve got this film on my CV.&quot; That year, &quot;People&quot; Magazine named Jackman its 2008 &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot;.

Jackman co-starred with Daniel Craig on Broadway at the Schoenfeld Theatre in a limited engagement of the play &quot;A Steady Rain&quot;, which ran from 10 September 2009, to 6 December 2009.

Jackman had a one-man show at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco from 3–15 May 2011. The production was a mixture of his favourite Broadway and Hollywood musical numbers, backed by a 17-piece orchestra, from shows including &quot;Oklahoma&quot; and &quot;The Boy from Oz&quot;. The show had a run-time of approximately 100 minutes, and also included slide shows of Jackman&#x27;s youth, family, and work, as well as some one-on-one interaction with the audience. Jackman was backed by fellow musical theatre veterans Merle Dandridge and Angel Reda. He later returned to Broadway in a new show, &quot;Hugh Jackman: Back on Broadway&quot; at the Broadhurst Theatre, which began performances on 25 October 2011 and concluded on 1 January 2012.

===2012–2018: Awards success, retiring Wolverine and film musicals===

In a November 2012 release, Jackman voiced the role of E.Aster Bunnymund (the Easter Bunny) in the animated film &quot;Rise of the Guardians&quot;, while his image was licensed to represent the &quot;Skulduggery Pleasant&quot; character Saracen Rue in the spin-off novel &quot;Tanith Low in... The Maleficent Seven&quot;, published December 2012. Jackman starred as Jean Valjean in Tom Hooper&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, an adaptation of the musical. The film opened on 25 December 2012. For the role, he lost 15 pounds and later had to regain 30 pounds to mirror his character&#x27;s newfound success. He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy in January 2013 for this performance and received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.

Jackman appeared alongside Kate Winslet in &quot;Movie 43&quot;, an ensemble comedy, in January 2013. Jackman (along with actress Kristen Wiig) was featured on &quot;You&#x27;ve Got the Look&quot;, a song by comedy hip hop group The Lonely Island on their third album, &quot;The Wack Album&quot;, released in June 2013. Jackman returned to Broadway in the new play, &quot;The River&quot;, which ran at the Circle in the Square Theatre from October 2014 to February 2015.
In November and December 2015, Jackman made a national tour of Australia with his show &quot;Broadway to Oz&quot;. He performed a range of songs from Broadway musicals, from &quot;Les Misérables&quot; to a Peter Allen tribute (including classics such as &quot;I Still Call Australia Home&quot;), with his 150-piece orchestra, choir, and backup dancers. The show began at Melbourne&#x27;s Rod Laver Arena and proceeded to Qantas Credit Union Arena, Brisbane Entertainment Centre, the Adelaide Entertainment Centre, and the Perth Arena.

Jackman then portrayed the villain Blackbeard in the film &quot;Pan&quot;, which revolved around the backstories of J.M. Barrie&#x27;s characters Peter Pan and Captain Hook. The movie received generally negative reviews and was a failure at the box office. In 2016, Jackman played fictional ski coach, Bronson Peary, in &quot;Eddie the Eagle&quot;, which portrayed how Eddie &quot;The Eagle&quot; Edwards became the first competitor to represent Great Britain in Olympic ski jumping in 1988.

Jackman had an uncredited cameo as Wolverine in the 2016 film &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot;. In 2017, he reprised the character for what was intended to be the final time in the third Wolverine film, &quot;Logan.&quot; Jackman&#x27;s performance and the film were critically acclaimed and it is regarded as one of the greatest superhero films of all-time. For his 17-year spanning long performance as Wolverine, Jackman topped &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;&#x27;s Greatest Superhero Movie Performances of All Time list. That year, he also starred as P. T. Barnum in the musical &quot;The Greatest Showman&quot;. He received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy nomination for the film, his third Golden Globe nomination, and also received a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album.

In 2018, he starred as American senator Gary Hart in Jason Reitman&#x27;s political drama film &quot;The Front Runner&quot;, which chronicled the rise of Hart as a Democratic presidential candidate in 1988, and his subsequent fall from grace when media reports surfaced of his extramarital affair. In 2019, he voiced the character, Sir Lionel Frost, in the animated film, &quot;Missing Link&quot;.

===2019–present: Concert tour, &quot;The Music Man&quot; and reprising Wolverine ===
In 2019, Jackman went on his first world tour called The Man. The Music. The Show. to perform songs from the album, &quot;The Greatest Showman: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;, and Broadway/Hollywood musical numbers. Comprising 88 shows, the tour visits North America, Europe, and Oceania. It began in May 2019, in Glasgow, Scotland and concluded in October 2019, in San Antonio, United States. In the 2019 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Jackman was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for &quot;eminent service to the performing arts as an acclaimed actor and performer, and to the global community, particularly as an advocate for poverty eradication.&quot;

Jackman starred in the comedy drama &quot;Bad Education&quot; (2019), opposite Allison Janney. Jackman and Laura Dern starred in Florian Zeller&#x27;s film &quot;The Son&quot;, adapted from Zeller&#x27;s own play of the same name.

Jackman reprised his role as Wolverine, in &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;, starring Ryan Reynolds, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was released on July 26, 2024.

About training to reprise his Wolverine role, Jackman said &quot;I was thrilled. My body was a little sore at the beginning, but I was thrilled that my body was still responding. And I realized how good it is for your brain. But the hardest bit - the food. I have to eat a lot. For me, for my body type, I’m naturally skinny. To get the size on, that’s the hardest bit. That’s the bit that does my head in.&quot;

==Other ventures==

=== Production company ===
In 2005, Jackman joined with longtime assistant John Palermo to form a production company, Seed Productions, whose first project was &quot;Viva Laughlin&quot; in 2007.

In a 2015 interview, he identified as Christian but says his version of faith differs from his father&#x27;s: &quot;He takes his religion very seriously and would prefer I go to church,&quot; &quot;We&#x27;ve had discussions about our separate beliefs. I just find the evangelical church too, well, restrictive.&quot; He meditates daily and incorporates teachings from the spiritually eclectic School of Practical Philosophy.

In November 2013, Jackman announced he had basal-cell carcinoma removed from his nose. He had a second carcinoma removed from his nose in May 2014, telling &quot;Associated Press&quot; that he expects to have future recurrences. This resulted in Jackman attending the various worldwide premieres of &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; with a bandage on his nose and urging his Instagram followers to wear sunscreen. In April 2023, Jackman shared in a social media update that his biopsy results had all returned negative. He had tests taken as a precaution after his doctor observed symptoms that, according to the doctor, &quot;could be or could not be&quot; basal-cell carcinomas. Jackman has undergone multiple procedures to remove skin cancer. He has continued to stress the significance of wearing high-SPF sunscreen regardless of the season.

On 18 March 2015, Jackman revealed that he had to cancel stage performances in Turkey because he had a left vocal cord haemorrhage.

A portrait of Jackman and Furness by Paul Newton was a finalist in the 2022 Archibald Prize.

Jackman has been a practitioner of Transcendental Meditation since the age of twenty. He said &quot;Nothing has ever opened my eyes like Transcendental Meditation has. It makes me calm and happy, and, well, it gives me some peace and quiet in what&#x27;s a pretty chaotic life!&quot;. He now helps the David Lynch Foundation to &quot;bring meditation to everyone from PTSD sufferers to inner-city kids&quot;.

<text>That is an English language word used for several grammatical purposes. These include use as an adjective, conjunction, pronoun, adverb and intensifier; it has distance from the speaker, as opposed to words like &quot;this&quot;.

The word did not originally exist in Old English, and its concept was represented by . Once it came into being, it was spelt as (among others, such as ), taking the role of the modern &quot;that&quot;. It also took on the role of the modern word &quot;what&quot;, though this has since changed, and &quot;that&quot; has recently replaced some usage of the modern &quot;which&quot;.

Pronunciation of the word varies according to its role within a sentence, with a strong form, and a weak form, .

== Modern usage ==
The word &quot;that&quot; serves several grammatical purposes. Owing to its wide versatility in usage, the writer Joseph Addison named it &quot;that jacksprat&quot; in 1771, and gave this example of a grammatically correct sentence: &quot;That that I say is this: that that that that gentleman has advanced, is not that, that he should have proved.&quot; &quot;That&quot; can be used as a demonstrative pronoun, 
demonstrative adjective, 
conjunction, 
relative word,
and an intensifier.

*&quot;That&quot; as a demonstrative pronoun refers to a specific object being discussed, such as in &quot;that is a cat&quot;; the word is a distal demonstrative pronoun, as opposed to proximal, because there is distance between the speaker and the object being discussed (as opposed to words such as &quot;this&quot;, where there is a relative sense of closeness). 
*When used as a demonstrative adjective, &quot;that&quot; describes which specific object is being discussed; for example, in the phrase &quot;that spotted dog is Fido&quot;, &quot;that&quot; specifies which particular dog is Fido among all spotted dogs. 
*In its usage as a conjunction, it connects clauses together, such as in &quot;I know that Peter is right&quot;. In sentences with several clauses, &quot;that&quot; is also used as a discriminator to differentiate between subjects of a clause. 
*As a relative pronoun, &quot;that&quot; introduces restrictive clauses, such as in &quot;the different factors that are fundamental and specific to particular features&quot;; in a study of medical science journals in Britain leading up to 2004, it was found that &quot;that&quot; had been largely replaced by the word &quot;which&quot; when used in this context, while writing that is increasingly formal—ranging from verse to fiction to nonfiction—finds &quot;that&quot; usage decreasing as &quot;wh-&quot; words (interrogatives) relatively increase. 
*&quot;That&quot; is used as a relative adverb, such as in &quot;it doesn&#x27;t cost that much&quot;. When used in this way, &quot;that&quot; requires inferences be drawn by the listener to determine the meaning of the speaker. 
*The word also intensifies elements of a sentence, similar in function to the word &quot;so&quot;, such as when one says &quot;I was that ill ... I couldn&#x27;t even stand up.&quot; But just as in its use as a relative adverb, &quot;that&quot; as an intensifier is best understood when the addressee infers meaning from its usage. In the example given, &quot;that&quot; intensifies and refers to a possible view already held by the addressee (whether the speaker was not seriously ill), even though the speaker does not explicitly confirm or intensify this previously-held belief.

== Historical usage ==

In Old English, &quot;that&quot; did not exist, and was only represented by &#x27;. It originated in the north of England sometime before the 1200s and spread around the country in the thirteenth century; it then rapidly became the dominant demonstrative pronoun. Before the writings of Ælfric of Eynsham, &#x27; was normally regularized as &#x27; in writing, but by the time Ælfric lived, &#x27; was common. As a pronoun, was widely used in Old English, though it was later replaced by &quot;wh-&quot; words. Where &#x27; had only stood in for subjects of a clause, instead took on the role of both a subject and an object, and when &#x27; and were both used, was always relative in orientation. The symbol &quot;ꝥ&quot; () was used as an abbreviation, before it was phased out by the Romantic &quot;þt&quot;. Similarly, &quot;yͭ&quot; was a ligature to represent &quot;that&quot;, as seen in the gravestone of William Shakespeare: &quot;&quot;. In Middle English, &#x27; was entirely replaced by (among other representations), before again being replaced by the modern &quot;that&quot;. Among all relative markers in the English language, including &quot;who&quot;, &quot;which&quot;, &quot;whose&quot;, and &quot;what&quot;, &quot;that&quot;—through its ancient form of &#x27;—appears to be the oldest.

In Old English translations of Latin (but only sparsely in original Old English texts), the phrase &#x27; is frequently used—typically meaning &quot;only&quot;—but its origins and characteristics are not well-understood. Frequently, the construction of &#x27; was in the original Latin, which referred then to a following clause. The use of &#x27; was for cases in which there was exclusivity (to distinguish between general and specific objects), but translators also used it in situations where exclusivity was already given through other syntactical elements of the sentence. In these texts, seems to be used pleonastically (redundantly), and it began to be used as an independent adverb. In the context of weather events, was never used, such as in the example sentence &#x27; (translated as &quot;that rains&quot;).

Similarly, for several centuries in Old English and early Middle English texts, the phrase (translated as &quot;among that&quot;) persisted. In the hundreds of years of its existence, it was used infrequently, though the usage was stable. Even in Old English, usage of &quot;&quot; (&quot;while&quot;) was much more commonplace, with its frequency some six times as large as in a surveyed corpus. experienced grammaticalisation (turning a word into a grammatical marker), and as a result of its low usage, possibly underwent a period of specialization, where it competed with other grammaticalised phrases.

After verbs such as &quot;said&quot;, and more generally in introducing a dependent clause, contemporary English grammar allows the speaker to either include &quot;that&quot; or to omit it. This construction—as in &quot;I suspect (that) he is right&quot;—is called the zero form when &quot;that&quot; is not used. While there has been some analysis of the relative frequency of Old and Middle English usage of the zero form, these studies are of limited value, since they rely on unique text corpora, failing to give a general view of its usage. In the late period of Middle English, the linguist Norihiko Otsu determined, the zero form was generally as popular as the form in which &quot;that&quot; is included. The zero form was common in documents closely relating to speech, such as sermons, suggesting spoken English often omitted &quot;that&quot; in these contexts.

== Pronunciation ==
&quot;That&quot; is pronounced either as (strong form) or (weak form) according to its grammatical role, with one as a demonstrative and the other as an anaphoric (referencing adverb). In this way, the strong form represents a determining pronoun (such as in &quot;what is that?&quot;), while the weak form is a subordinating word (as in &quot;I think that it&#x27;s a mistake&quot;).

The pronunciation of the voiced dental fricative may vary, such as being stopped in Cameroonian English, resulting in a pronunciation of .

<text>An eclogue is a poem in a classical style on a pastoral subject. Poems in the genre are sometimes also called bucolics. The term is also used for a musical genre thought of as evoking a pastoral scene.

==Classical beginnings==
The form of the word &quot;eclogue&quot; in contemporary English developed from Middle English , which came from Latin , which came from Greek () in the sense &#x27;selection, literary product&#x27; (which was only one of the meanings it had in Greek). The term was applied metaphorically to short writings in any genre, including parts of a poetic sequence or poetry book.

As a genre of poetry, Eclogues began with the Latin poet Virgil, whose collection of ten &quot;Eclogae&quot; was ultimately modelled on the &quot;Idylls&quot; of Theocritus. and was alternatively termed &quot;Bucolica&quot;. Found there was a sophisticated mixture of pastoral dialogues, song contests and contemporary references. Virgil&#x27;s term was used by later Latin poets to refer to their own pastoral poetry, often in imitation of Virgil, as in the cases of the &quot;Eclogae&quot; of Calpurnius Siculus and the &quot;Eclogae&quot; of Nemesianus. Calpurnius also employed rustic vocabulary and archaic expressions to add to their distancing effect.

==In Britain==
The practice of writing eclogues was extended by the 15th century Italian humanists Baptista Mantuanus and Jacopo Sannazaro whose Latin poetry was imitated in a variety of European vernaculars during the Renaissance, including in English. However, &quot;the first Renaissance bucolic poem written in England&quot; was a 1497 eclogue in Latin by Johannes Opicius in praise of Henry VII. Written in the form of a dialogue between the shepherds Mopsus and Melibœus, praising the ruler of the country for bringing back a Golden Age of prosperity and safety, the poem was modelled on the first of Virgil&#x27;s Eclogues in praise of Octavian and the first eclogue by Calpurnius Siculus in praise of Nero. So far as is known, the poem remained in manuscript and even the first eclogues written in the English language by Alexander Barclay remained unpublished until about 1514. These were written earlier and adapted from 15th century Latin originals by Mantuanus and Aeneas Silvius.

Edmund Spenser was also inspired by Mantuan&#x27;s eclogues, as well as by Virgil and Theocritus, when he composed the &quot;Shepheardes Calendar&quot; (1579), a series of twelve eclogues, one for each month of the year. Each is titled an &quot;Aegloga&quot; and contains for the most part dialogues by different speakers on a variety of subjects. In the background too is the example of Calpurnius, manifested here in the antiquated vocabulary drawn from John Skelton and Geoffrey Chaucer. And behind the plain (but far from unlettered) language is vigorous allusion to contemporary events, particularly the proposed marriage between the queen and a Catholic Frenchman. Spenser&#x27;s eclogues were youthful work, as were Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Pastorals&quot;, consisting of four shepherd dialogues divided between the seasons. They were originally composed in 1704 but first published in 1709; and to the 1717 edition, Pope added his originally intended &quot;Discourse on Pastoral Poetry&quot; in which he acknowledged the examples of Theocritus and Virgil (&quot;the only undisputed authors of Pastoral&quot;) along with Spenser.

In between had come Phineas Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Piscatorie Eclogs&quot; (1633), imitations of Sannazaro&#x27;s much earlier &quot;Eclogae Piscatoriae&quot; (Fishermen&#x27;s eclogues, 1526), in which the traditional shepherds are exchanged for fishermen from the Bay of Naples. He was followed in this refocussing of the traditional subject matter in the following century by William Diaper, in whose &quot;Nereides: or Sea-Eclogues&quot; (1712) the speakers are sea-gods and sea-nymphs.

==Variations on the theme==
By the early 18th century, the pastoral genre was ripe for renewal and an element of parody began to be introduced. John Gay ridiculed the eclogues of Ambrose Philips in the six &#x27;pastorals&#x27; of &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Week&quot;. The impulse to renewal and parody also met in the various &quot;town eclogues&quot; published at this time, transferring their focus from the fields to city preoccupations. The first was a joint publication by Jonathan Swift and his friends in &quot;The Tatler&quot; for 1710; John Gay wrote three more, as well as &quot;The Espousal&quot;, &quot;a sober eclogue between two of the people called Quakers&quot;; and Mary Wortley Montagu began writing a further six &quot;Town Eclogues&quot; from 1715.

In Scotland Allan Ramsay brought the novelty of Scots dialect to his two pastoral dialogues of 1723, &quot;Patie and Roger&quot; and &quot;Jenny and Meggy&quot;, before expanding them into the pastoral drama of &quot;The Gentle Shepherd&quot; in the following year. Later the eclogue was further renewed by being set in exotic lands, first by the &quot;Persian Eclogues&quot; (1742) of William Collins, a revised version of which titled &quot;Oriental Eclogues&quot; was published in 1757. It was followed by the three &quot;African Eclogues&quot; (1770) of Thomas Chatterton, and by Scott of Amwell&#x27;s three &quot;Oriental Eclogues&quot; (1782) with settings in Arabia, Bengal and Tang dynasty China.

In 1811 the fortunes of the Peninsular War brought the subject back to Europe in the form of four &quot;Spanish Eclogues, including an elegy on the death of the Marquis de la Romana&quot; issued under the pseudonym Hispanicus. These were described in a contemporary review as &quot;formed on the model of Collins&quot;. In the following decade they were followed by a vernacular &quot;Irish eclogue&quot;, &quot;Darby and Teague&quot;, a satirical account of a royal visit to Dublin ascribed to William Russell Macdonald (1787–1854).

==Musical genre==
The term eclogue or its equivalents was eventually applied to pastoral music, with the first significant examples being piano works by the Czech composer Václav Tomášek. 19th century composers who adopted the title include Jan Václav Voříšek for piano; Franz Liszt, &quot;Eglogue&quot;, the seventh piece in the first book of &quot;Années de Pèlerinage&quot;, 1842); César Franck, &quot;Eglogue&quot;, op. 3, 1842, as well as the later eighth movement of the oratorio &quot;Ruth&quot; (1882), titled &quot;eglogue biblique&quot;, a setting of the words of Alexandre Guillemin; Antonín Dvořák, &quot;4 eclogues for piano&quot;, Op. 56, 1880; Vítězslav Novák, &quot;Eklogen&quot;, Op. 11 for piano, 1896; and Mel Bonis, &quot;Eglogue&quot; for piano, Op. 12, 1898.

Two further pieces for solo piano followed in the new century: Egon Wellesz&#x27;s &quot;4 eclogues&quot;, Op. 11, 1912, and Jean Sibelius&#x27;s &quot;Ekloge&quot;, the first of his &quot;4 lyric pieces for piano&quot;, Op. 74, 1914. Similar titles were given the second and third movements of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Duo Concertant&quot; (&quot;Eclogue I&quot; and &quot;Eclogue II&quot;, 1932), while the middle movement of his three-movement &quot;Ode&quot; (1943) is also titled &quot;Eclogue&quot;. Gerald Finzi&#x27;s &quot;Eclogue&quot; for piano and string orchestra, Op. 10, was revised in the 1940s and given that title then. An &quot;Eclogue&quot; for horn and strings by Maurice Blower dates from about the 1950s. In the 21st century, American composer Henry Justin Rubin&#x27;s &quot;Egloga&quot; for violin and piano dates from 2006.

<text>A mucocutaneous junction, or mucocutaneous boundary, is a region of the body in which mucosa transitions to skin. Mucocutaneous zones occur in animals, at the body orifices.

In humans, mucocutaneous junctions are found at the lips, nostrils, conjunctivae, urethra, vagina (in females), foreskin (in males), clitoral hood (in females), and anus.

In the nostrils the mucocutaneous junction has a dense microvascular network, and shows a marked similarity to that found in the mouth, between the oral mucosa and the lips.

At a mucocutaneous junction, epithelium transitions to epidermis, lamina propria transitions to dermis, and smooth muscle transitions to skeletal muscle. A mucocutaneous junction is often the site of an arterial anastomosis, a watershed area of venous and lymphatic drainage, and sensory (but not motor) nerve overlap.

Winkelmann (1959) documented that the mucocutaneous boundary is a &quot;specific erogenous zone with rete ridges where the nerve endings rise closer to the surface&quot;.

<text>Stephen Percy Harris (born 12 March 1956) is an English musician and songwriter, best known as the bassist, keyboardist, backing vocalist, primary songwriter, founder, and leader of heavy metal band Iron Maiden. He is the band&#x27;s only constant member since their inception in 1975 and, along with guitarist Dave Murray, the only member to appear on every album.

Harris has a recognisable and popular style of bass playing, particularly the &quot;gallop&quot; which can be found on many Iron Maiden recordings, such as the singles &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; and &quot;The Trooper&quot;. In addition to his role as the band&#x27;s bass player, writer and backing vocalist, he has undertaken many other roles for the group, such as producing and co-producing their albums, directing and editing their live videos and performing studio keyboards and synthesizers. He has been cited as one of the greatest heavy metal bassists ever.

In 2012, Harris released his debut solo album, &quot;British Lion&quot;, which was followed by &quot;The Burning&quot; in 2020.

==Early life==
Harris was born on 12 March 1956 in the back room of his grandmother&#x27;s house, in Leytonstone, then part of Essex, where he grew up aspiring to be a professional footballer. Scouted by Wally St Pier, Harris was asked to train for West Ham United. After gaining an interest in rock music in his early teens, he realised that he no longer desired to play football professionally. In particular, he was greatly influenced by the Beatles. Harris attended Leyton Senior High School for Boys (now Leyton Sixth Form College) where he studied architecture.

Initially Harris wanted to play drums, but did not have enough space for a drum kit in his house and so decided on the bass instead. Entirely self-taught, his first bass was a copy of a Fender Precision model which cost him £40 in 1971.

Just ten months after he bought his first bass, Harris joined a band, initially known as Influence and later Gypsy&#x27;s Kiss, featuring Bob Verscoyle (lead vocals), Dave Smith (guitar) and drummer Paul Sears. After a short number of gigs at the Cart and Horses pub in Maryland Point, Stratford and the Bridgehouse in Canning Town, the band split up and Harris auditioned for a band called Smiler in February 1974. In this band, Harris began writing his own songs and worked with future Iron Maiden members Dennis Wilcock and Doug Sampson, but left the band after they refused to play his material, claiming it was too complicated. Harris claims to have played 30 to 40 shows with Smiler before he left.

==Career==
=== Iron Maiden ===

Upon leaving Smiler, Harris went on to create Iron Maiden on Christmas Day 1975, with the band&#x27;s name being inspired by the film &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot;. Before Iron Maiden signed their contract with EMI in 1979, Harris worked as an architectural draughtsman in the East End of London until he was made redundant, at which point he undertook a job as a street sweeper.

Since their inception, Harris has been the band&#x27;s principal composer and lyricist. His songwriting typically showcases his trademark galloping bass patterns, which features heavily in songs such as &quot;The Trooper&quot; and &quot;Run to the Hills&quot;, and his progressive rock-influenced time changes. Later, Harris&#x27; songs became more progressive, and guitarist Adrian Smith has commented that Harris now prefers contributing &quot;lyrics and melodies and arranging&quot; to other member&#x27;s songs over writing alone. Harris frequently writes lyrics about mythology, history or topics inspired from books and films, reflecting his interests and progressive rock influences.

===British Lion===

In September 2012, Harris released his first solo album, &quot;British Lion&quot;. Originating with a band, named British Lion, which he managed and wrote with in the early 1990s, Harris kept in touch with its vocalist, Richard Taylor, and guitarist, Graham Leslie, and the album, consisting of 1970s influenced hard rock songs, was written and recorded over a number of years around Iron Maiden&#x27;s tour schedule. Speaking to &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in September 2012, Harris stated that he considers the record to be &quot;more of a side-project&quot; than a solo album, as he is more &quot;comfortable in a band environment.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Classic Rock&quot; in August, Harris stated that he will be releasing more solo albums and hopes to tour with the band in the future. The band has undertaken two European club tours in 2013 and 2014, with an additional tour taking place in 2016. On 2 September 2016, Harris announced that he intends to issue a live album recorded at shows from across the three tours.

Their second album, titled &quot;The Burning&quot;, was released on 17 January 2020.

==Artistry==

===Technique===
Harris had been named among the best and most influential heavy metal bassists. He has a &quot;galloping&quot; playing style: usually an eighth note followed by two sixteenth notes at fast tempo (e.g., &quot;The Trooper&quot; and &quot;Run to the Hills&quot;) or eighth note triplets, which he plays with two fingers, rather than using a plectrum. Before playing, Harris often chalks his fingers, to make these fast patterns easier to play, as shown on the bonus DVD for the &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; album. Harris&#x27;s playing is often unusually prominent in the mix on Iron Maiden&#x27;s recordings; he generally uses a tone with a treble-heavy EQ and compression to accentuate the attack on the strings. Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers has commented that &quot;Steve taught himself in a way that nobody can really copy it. People say it&#x27;s like a lead guitar, but it&#x27;s not. It gives the band a basis and it moves around quite a lot, but it&#x27;s the tone that he has. Steve has a way of hearing things and a tone that isn&#x27;t normally associated with a bass, it&#x27;s more like a rhythm guitar.&quot;

===Influences===

Harris was influenced by the progressive rock bands of the 1970s, as well as early hard rock and heavy metal bands. His influences include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Led Zeppelin, Golden Earring, Pink Floyd, Thin Lizzy, UFO, Uriah Heep, Wishbone Ash, and Yes. Speaking about the early Iron Maiden sound, Steve Harris described the band as using twin-guitar harmonies inspired by Wishbone Ash and Thin Lizzy, complex time and mood changes from Genesis and Jethro Tull, and the dark melodic elements of Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and Led Zeppelin. Harris&#x27; bass playing was influenced by Yes&#x27;s Chris Squire and UFO&#x27;s Pete Way, among others.

===Equipment===

Since Iron Maiden&#x27;s beginning to the present day, Harris plays a specially-painted Fender Precision Bass, featured on every Iron Maiden album, which has gone through a total of four colour changes since he began using it. Originally white, it was then changed to black prior to the band&#x27;s first album, followed by blue sparkle and finally white with claret and blue pinstriping with the West Ham United F.C. crest. Harris has had his bass modified to include a mirrored scratchplate, Badass bridges and Seymour Duncan custom Steve Harris Signature SPB-4 pickups and uses his own signature set of RotoSound flatwound strings. In 2009, Fender issued a signature Steve Harris Precision bass, featuring an alder body, a blue-sparkle finish, mirrored scratchplate, Seymour Duncan SPB-1 pick-ups and a Badass II bridge. In 2015, Fender released a revised model of the signature bass, which now features a maple body, a white finish with blue pinstripes and the West Ham crest, a Fender High Mass bridge and a Seymour Duncan SPB-4 Steve Harris signature pick-up, with the pick-up also being sold separately.

In 2005, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; reported that he uses eight 4x12&quot; Marshall cabinets with Trace Elliot amplifiers. He also uses four Sony WRT 27 wireless transmitters, allowing him to be as mobile as possible on stage. His signal chain in 2000 also included a Trace Elliot preamp and a DBX compressor.

==Other interests and talents==
In addition to playing bass and writing music/lyrics for the band, Steve Harris has taken on numerous other roles, such as:
* music production/mixing
* music video directing/editing
* live video directing/editing
* keyboards
* backing vocals
* string/bass synthesizers

Although he performed keyboards on &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;, along with guitarist Adrian Smith, in 1988, Harris only began regularly contributing keyboards to Iron Maiden&#x27;s studio albums from &quot;Virtual XI&quot; onwards. Until &quot;Virtual XI&quot;, Michael Kenney, Harris&#x27; bass technician, had provided the keyboards from 1990&#x27;s &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; onwards, and still does so live and acts as a supervisor in the studio. Along with Smith and guitarist Dave Murray, Harris experimented with synthesizers on the &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; and &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot; albums, using bass synth on &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;, and performing &quot;string synth&quot; keyboards on &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;.

Harris played an increasing role in mixing the band&#x27;s albums and produced most of their 1990&#x27;s output, with recording taking place at a studio he owned at the time, located in a barn on his property, named &quot;Barnyard Studios&quot;. Since 2000&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;, at Bruce Dickinson&#x27;s insistence, the band did not record again at Barnyard, which Dickinson claims had limitations due to its size, and hired Kevin Shirley, with whom Harris co-produces.

Harris also directs and edits many of the band&#x27;s live videos, beginning with &quot;Maiden England&quot; in 1989. Although not intending to, Harris edited the &quot;Rock in Rio&quot; DVD as he was unsatisfied with the results produced by the band&#x27;s hired production crew. In undertaking the project, Harris had to teach himself how to use digital editing software with equipment he had installed in Barnyard Studios, and went on to edit Iron Maiden&#x27;s next DVD, &quot;Death on the Road&quot;. On top of this, he has contributed to the production of thirteen of the band&#x27;s music videos, with &quot;Infinite Dreams&quot;, &quot;Holy Smoke&quot;, &quot;Tailgunner&quot; and &quot;Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter&quot; being directed and edited by Harris alone.

==Personal life==

Harris&#x27; eldest daughter, Lauren, is a singer and classically trained actor who supported Iron Maiden with her solo outfit in 2006 and 2008. In 2008, she released a solo album, entitled &quot;Calm Before the Storm&quot;, and is currently a member of a band called Kingdom of I, after forming Six Hour Sundown. Harris&#x27; oldest son George plays guitar in a band the Raven Age, who were the opening act on Iron Maiden&#x27;s The Book of Souls World Tour in 2016, The Legacy of the Beast World Tour 2019 and The Future Past World Tour 2023. His second-oldest daughter, Kerry, works as a Production Assistant for Iron Maiden while his third-oldest daughter, Faye, is a fashion writer for &quot;HuffPost&quot;. In 2024, Faye married Tyrone Wood, the son of Rolling Stone guitar player Ronnie Wood.

In 1993, Harris was divorced from his wife, psychotherapist Lorraine Jury, whom he met 16 years previously. He later said this was &quot;probably the toughest time I&#x27;ve ever faced,&quot; and the changes in his personal life are credited with inspiring the mood of the following Iron Maiden album, 1995&#x27;s &quot;The X Factor&quot;. Harris has four children with Lorraine, and two children with current partner Emma.

Since the 1980s, Harris has owned a Grade II listed building in Sheering, Essex, in the grounds of which he built his own recording and editing studio, &quot;Barnyard&quot;. In November 2012, the nine-acre property was put on sale. The property was sold in March 2022 having been on the market for a number of years for £3,950,000. Harris now lives primarily in the Bahamas.

A keen footballer, Harris played for amateur clubs as a child and was later scouted by Wally St Pier and asked to train for West Ham United, of whom he has been a fan since he was 9 years old. Although he had aspired to play professionally up to that point, Harris would eventually realise that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t really what [he] wanted to do.&quot; Nevertheless, Harris still plays football regularly with his own team, &quot;Maidonians&quot;, and still supports West Ham, staying in contact with the club and having their crest on his most-used Precision Bass. Harris also plays tennis, and is a photographer.

<doc id="302717" wikidata="Q1899093" url="?curid=302717" title="Nasal hair">
<text>Nasal hair or nose hair is the hair in the nostril. Adult human noses have hairs, which serve as a crude air filter to stop foreign particles from entering the nasal cavity, as well as to help collect moisture. Nasal hair is different from the cilia of the ciliated lining of the nasal cavity. These cilia are microtubule-based structures that are found in the respiratory tract, involved in the mucociliary clearance mechanism.

==Functions==
A 2011 study indicated that increased nasal hair density decreases the development of asthma in those who have allergic rhinitis, possibly due to an increased trapping capacity to filter out pollen and other common allergens.

==Removal==
A number of devices have been sold to trim nasal hair, including miniature rotary clippers and attachments for electric shavers. The trimmers shorten the hair to such lengths that they do not appear outside of the nasal passage. A pair of tweezers may also be used to facilitate the removal of such hairs. Other means are in effect such as waxing, laser hair removal, and electrolysis.

<text>Fiona Watson (1968 – 19 August 2003) was a Scottish political affairs officer working in Sérgio Vieira de Mello&#x27;s office who was killed along with other members of United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq staff in the Canal Hotel bombing in Baghdad, on the afternoon of 19 August 2003.

==Biography==
Watson received a first class honours degree from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, and an M.Phil. in &#x27;International relations and Ballistic studies&#x27; from the University of Cambridge, where she was part of Darwin College.

Prior to joining the UN, Watson worked with the European Commission and for a period with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. During her career with the UN, Watson had been involved in many of the world&#x27;s hot spots, including Bosnia and Kosovo: Watson worked in the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo to Bernard Kouchner the UN&#x27;s special representative to Kosovo. An experienced linguist, she worked with the UN for almost four years as a political analyst. At the time of her death she was political affairs officer on the staff of Special Representative of the Secretary-General Sérgio Vieira de Mello.

Watson&#x27;s family and friends set up the Fiona Watson Memorial Fund to provide bursaries for final year students at her first university, Heriot-Watt, to enable them to spend a year with the UN or a similar international organisation.

<text>Bowater Inc. was a paper and pulp business headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina. It merged with Abitibi-Consolidated in 2007, and the combined company went on to become Resolute Forest Products.

==History==
The North American assets of Bowater plc were built up in the 1970s, becoming known as Bowater Inc., headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina. The company demerged from Bowater plc in 1984.

The company acquired additional Canadian interests in the late 1990s, when it bought Avenor (formerly Canadian Pacific Forest Products). By the mid-2000s, Bowater Inc had 10,000 employees across 12 pulp and paper mills in the United States, Canada and South Korea, along with 13 North American sawmills. On 29 January 2007, Bowater Inc and Abitibi-Consolidated announced they would be merging to create AbitibiBowater. The merger created the third largest pulp and paper company in North America, and the eighth largest in the world. On 1 July 2012, the company name changed to Resolute Forest Products.

<doc id="302747" wikidata="Q685366" url="?curid=302747" title="Iron maiden">
<text>The iron maiden is a torture device, consisting of a solid iron cabinet with a hinged front and spike-covered interior, sufficiently tall to enclose a human being. While often popularly thought to have been used in the medieval period, the first stories citing the iron maiden were composed in the 19th century. The use of iron maidens is considered to be a myth; evidence of their actual use has never been found. They have become a popular image in media involving the Middle Ages and involving torture chambers.

== History ==

Despite its reputation as a medieval instrument of torture, there is no evidence of the existence of iron maidens before the 19th century. There are, however, ancient reports of the Spartan tyrant Nabis using a similar device around 200 B.C. for extortion and murder. The Abbasid vizier Ibn al-Zayyat is said to have created a &quot;wooden oven-like chest that had iron spikes&quot; for torture, which would ironically be used during his own imprisonment and execution in 847.

Wolfgang Schild, a professor of criminal law, criminal law history, and philosophy of law at the Bielefeld University, has argued that putative iron maidens were pieced together from artifacts found in museums to create spectacular objects intended for (commercial) exhibition. Several 19th-century iron maidens are on display in museums around the world, including the Museum of Us, the Meiji University Museum, and several torture museums in Europe.

=== Possible inspirations ===
The 19th-century iron maidens may have been constructed as a misinterpretation of a medieval Schandmantel, which was made of wood and metal but without spikes. Inspiration for the iron maiden may also have come from the Carthaginian execution of Marcus Atilius Regulus as recorded in Tertullian&#x27;s &quot;To the Martyrs&quot; (Chapter 4) and Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s &quot;The City of God&quot; (I.15), in which the Carthaginians &quot;shut him into a tight wooden box, where he was forced to stand, spiked with the sharpest nails on all sides so that he could not lean in any direction without being pierced,&quot; or from Polybius&#x27; account of Nabis of Sparta&#x27;s deadly statue of his wife, the Iron Apega (earliest form of the device).

== The iron maiden of Nuremberg ==

The most famous iron maiden that popularized the design was that of Nuremberg, first displayed possibly as far back as 1802. The original was lost in the Allied bombing of Nuremberg in 1945. A copy &quot;from the Royal Castle of Nuremberg&quot;, crafted for public display, was sold through J. Ichenhauser of London to the Earl of Shrewsbury in 1890 along with other torture devices, and, after being displayed at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, Chicago, Illinois, 1893, was taken on an American tour. This copy was auctioned in the early 1960s and is now on display at the Medieval Crime Museum, Rothenburg ob der Tauber.

=== Origins ===
Some historians have argued that Johann Philipp Siebenkees (1759–1796) made up the history of the device. According to Siebenkees&#x27; colportage, it was first used on August 14, 1515, to execute a coin forger.

<doc id="302754" wikidata="Q751946" url="?curid=302754" title="2006 in film">
<text>The following is an overview of events in 2006, including the highest-grossing films, award ceremonies and festivals, a list of films released and notable deaths. Pixar celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2006 with the release of its 7th film, &quot;Cars&quot;.

==Evaluation of the year==
Philip French of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described 2006 as &quot;an outstanding year for British cinema&quot;. He went on to emphasize, &quot;Six of our well-established directors have made highly individual films of real distinction: Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s &quot;A Cock and Bull Story&quot;, Ken Loach&#x27;s Palme d&#x27;Or winner &quot;The Wind That Shakes the Barley&quot;, Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;The Prestige&quot;, Stephen Frears&#x27;s &quot;The Queen&quot;, Paul Greengrass&#x27;s &quot;United 93&quot; and Nicholas Hytner&#x27;s &quot;The History Boys&quot;. Two young directors made confident debuts, both offering a jaundiced view of contemporary Britain: Andrea Arnold&#x27;s Red Road and Paul Andrew Williams&#x27;s London to Brighton. In addition the gifted Mexican Alfonso Cuaron came here to make the dystopian thriller &quot;Children of Men&quot;.&quot; He also stated, &quot;In the (United) States, M. Night Shyamalan of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; fame fell flat on his over-confident face with &quot;Lady in the Water&quot;, but Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Departed&quot; was his best for years, and he was with Jack Nicholson at last. Apart from that, the best American films were political (&quot;Syriana&quot;, &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot;, &quot;The New World&quot;) or very personal (&quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Little Children&quot;, &quot;The Squid and the Whale&quot;). Sadly, Oliver Stone&#x27;s 9/11 picture &quot;World Trade Center&quot; was neither. Asian cinema produced a string of elegant thrillers and horror flicks. The best Eastern European movie was &quot;The Death of Mr. Lazarescu&quot;, a devastating look at the Romania Ceausescu left behind him. Most of the best Western European films came from France, with Michael Haneke&#x27;s &quot;Caché&quot;, proving the most widely discussed art-house puzzle picture since &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot;. The award of 18 certificates by the BBFC to Shortbus and Destricted has brought close the abolition of censorship, but not of classification, and Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; was a real step forward for the representation of homosexuals in mainstream cinema, though Gore Vidal claims that there&#x27;s a gay subtext to every western. However, the year&#x27;s most extraordinary event, or conjunction, was the almost simultaneous release of Tommy Lee Jones&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada&quot; and Al Gore&#x27;s documentary &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;. Who would have predicted in the Sixties, when they were roommates at Harvard and used by Erich Segal as joint models for Oliver Barrett IV in &quot;Love Story&quot;, that both Jones and Gore would end up as movie stars - if, in Gore&#x27;s case, accidentally and temporarily?&quot;

==Highest-grossing films==

=== Box office records ===

<doc id="302755" wikidata="Q1900400" url="?curid=302755" title="Acute bronchitis">
<text>Acute bronchitis, also known as a chest cold, is short-term bronchitis – inflammation of the bronchi (large and medium-sized airways) of the lungs. The most common symptom is a cough. Other symptoms include coughing up mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, fever, and chest discomfort. The infection may last from a few to ten days. The cough may persist for several weeks afterward with the total duration of symptoms usually around three weeks. Some have symptoms for up to six weeks.
In more than 90% of cases, the cause is a viral infection. These viruses may be spread through the air when people cough or by direct contact. Risk factors include exposure to tobacco smoke, dust, and other air pollution. A small number of cases are due to high levels of air pollution or bacteria such as &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; or &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;. Diagnosis is typically based on a person&#x27;s signs and symptom. The color of the sputum does not indicate if the infection is viral or bacterial. Determining the underlying organism is typically not needed. Other causes of similar symptoms include asthma, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis, and COPD. A chest X-ray may be useful to detect pneumonia.
Prevention is by not smoking and avoiding other lung irritants. Frequent hand washing and flu vaccination may also be protective. Treatment of acute bronchitis typically involves rest, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and NSAIDs to help with the fever. Cough medicine has little support for its use and is not recommended in children less than six years of age. Antibiotics should generally not be used. An exception is when acute bronchitis is due to pertussis. Tentative evidence supports honey and pelargonium to help with symptoms.
Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diseases. About 5% of adults are affected and about 6% of children have at least one episode a year. It occurs more often in the winter. More than 10 million people in the United States visit a doctor each year for this condition with approximately 70% receiving antibiotics, most of which are not needed. There are efforts to decrease the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis.

==Signs and symptoms==
The primary symptom is a cough with sputum that may be purulent. The illness may also cause shortness of breath or wheezing. Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) often precede acute bronchitis, with overlapping symptoms including headache, nasal congestion, and sore throat. About a third of patients will experience a fever, but fevers due to acute bronchitis rarely rise above or last longer than a few days. As fever and other systemic symptoms are less common in acute bronchitis than in pneumonia, their presence raises suspicion for the latter, especially high or persistent fevers.

==Cause==
Acute bronchitis can be caused by contagious pathogens, most commonly viruses. Typical viruses include respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, influenza, and others. Bacteria are uncommon pathogens but may include &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Chlamydophila pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, and &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;.
* Damage caused by irritation of the airways leads to inflammation and leads to neutrophils infiltrating the lung tissue.
* Mucosal hypersecretion is promoted by a substance released by neutrophils.
* Further obstruction to the airways is caused by more goblet cells in the small airways. This is typical of chronic bronchitis.
* Although infection is not the reason or cause of chronic bronchitis, it is seen to aid in sustaining the bronchitis.

==Diagnosis==

A physical examination will often reveal decreased intensity of breath sounds, wheezing, rhonchi, and prolonged expiration. During examination, physicians rely on history and the presence of persistent or acute onset of cough, followed by a URTI with no traces of pneumonia. Acute bronchitis is typically a clinical diagnosis that relies on patients history and exam, and should be suspected in patients with an acute onset of cough, which often follows a URTI without traces of pneumonia.

Although there is no universally-accepted clinical definition for acute bronchitis, there is a proposed set of practical criteria (Macfarlane, 2001) that include:
* An acute illness of less than three weeks.
* Cough as the predominant symptom.
* At least one other lower respiratory tract symptom, such as sputum production, wheezing, chest pain.
* No alternative explanation for the symptoms.

A variety of tests may be performed in people presenting with cough and shortness of breath:
* A chest X-ray is useful to exclude pneumonia which is more common in those with a fever, fast heart rate, fast respiratory rate, or who are old.
* A sputum sample showing neutrophil granulocytes (inflammatory white blood cells) and culture showing that has pathogenic microorganisms such as &quot;Streptococcus&quot; species.
* A blood test would indicate inflammation (as indicated by a raised white blood cell count and elevated C-reactive protein).

Decreased breath sounds, crackles, wheezing, and rhonchi that clears with coughs may be heard in the chest. Dullness to percussion and pleural rub suggest disease extension beyond the bronchi such as seen with pneumonia. Paroxysms of cough followed by inspiratory whoop and vomiting suggests pertussis.

==Prevention==
Approaches to prevent acute bronchitis include smoking cessation and avoiding lung irritants. Frequent hand washing may also be protective. An oral whole cell nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae vaccine given in the fall has demonstrated short term effectiveness in reducing the frequency and severity of the disease during the winter.

==Treatment==
Most cases are self-limited and resolve themselves in a few weeks.
Pain medications may help with symptoms. Other recommendations may include rest and keeping well hydrated.
===Antibiotics===
Evidence does not support the general use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. A systematic review found antibiotics reduced cough by an average of 12 hours (out of a total average of about 14–28 days). Antibiotics caused more side effects such as nausea and diarrhoea, and also may promote antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It is possible they are useful in susceptible groups such as the frail and elderly but there was not enough research information to determine this.

Referring to acute bronchitis by benign-sounding terms such as &quot;chest cold&quot; or &quot;viral infection&quot; may reduce antibiotic usage by improving patient satisfaction when antibiotics are not prescribed.

===Smoking cessation===

To help the bronchial tree heal faster and not make bronchitis worse, smokers should quit smoking completely.

=== Alternative therapeutic approaches ===
Salbutamol is not effective in children with an acute cough who do not have restricted airways. There is weak evidence that salbutamol may be useful in adults with wheezing due to a restricted airway; however, it may result in nervousness, shakiness or a tremor.

==Prognosis==
Acute bronchitis usually lasts a few days or weeks. It may accompany or closely follow a cold or the flu, or may occur on its own. Bronchitis usually begins with a dry cough, including waking the patient at night. After a few days, it progresses to a wetter or productive cough, which may be accompanied by fever, fatigue, and headache. The fever, fatigue, and malaise may last only a few days, but the wet cough may last up to several weeks.

==Epidemiology==
Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diseases. About 5% of adults are affected and about 6% of children have at least one episode a year. It occurs more often in the winter.

In infants under one year of age, acute bronchitis was the most common reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the US in 2011.

<doc id="302757" wikidata="Q1714159" url="?curid=302757" title="From Justin to Kelly">
<text>From Justin to Kelly is a 2003 American musical romantic comedy film, written by Kim Fuller and directed by Robert Iscove. The movie features Kelly Clarkson, the winner of the first season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, and Justin Guarini, the runner-up. A critical and commercial failure, the film received the Golden Raspberry Award for &quot;Worst &#x27;Musical&#x27; of Our First 25 Years&quot; in 2005. It has gained a reputation as one of the worst movies ever made.

==Plot==
In Texas, Kelly Taylor works as a waitress and singer at a bar where she attracts the attention of many cowboys, including Luke. Her college classmates, Alexa and Kaya, invite her to join them on a spring break vacation in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Despite finding the typical spring break activities demeaning, Kelly decides to go on the trip to escape her miserable job. In Miami, college student Justin Bell is also on vacation with his friends Brandon and Eddie, who run a party promoter business called BR&amp;J.

Upon arriving in Fort Lauderdale, Kelly, Alexa, and Kaya attend a beach concert where Kelly first encounters Justin. During the concert, Justin and Brandon offer Eddie dating advice before leaving. Later, Justin and Kelly search for each other at a party, eventually finding each other in a bathroom. Kelly attempts to give Justin her phone number on a napkin but misses, causing it to fall into a puddle. Unable to retrieve her number, Kelly leaves. Justin then asks Alexa for Kelly&#x27;s number, but Alexa gives him her own number instead, pretending it is Kelly&#x27;s. That night, she texts Justin, pretending to be Kelly, and rejects his advances. Meanwhile, Kaya begins a romantic relationship with Carlos, a busboy, and they enjoy a night out at a Salsa club.

The next day, Alexa signs up Kelly for BR&amp;J&#x27;s whipped cream bikini contest, hoping to observe Justin&#x27;s character. Kelly initially feels angry at Justin for participating in such a degrading event, but they later run into each other at a food truck. They decide to go on a boat ride together and connect during their time on the boat. They make plans to meet at the beach the following night. Meanwhile, Brandon receives a ticket for hosting the contest without a permit, and Kaya complains to Carlos&#x27; boss about his mistreatment, resulting in Carlos being fired.

Alexa, pretending to be Kelly, texts Justin and instructs him to meet her at a bar instead of the beach. Alexa sings about her desire for love, and when Justin arrives, she tells him that Kelly has a boyfriend back home. She calls Luke and asks him to come to Florida. Eddie continues his search for his online date but gets beaten up by a jock and misses their rendezvous.

Later, Kelly feels upset when Justin fails to show up at the beach. Luke appears and claims that Kelly is his girlfriend. Luke and Justin decide to settle their differences through a hovercraft race, but Luke gets injured during the race. Brandon receives another ticket, this time from Cutler, the police officer, for gambling on the race. Justin seeks advice from Alexa on how to win Kelly back, but Alexa kisses him, which Kelly witnesses. Carlos becomes angry with Kaya for interfering in his life but later realizes he should have stood up to his boss earlier. He apologizes to Kaya by arranging a romantic dinner for them in a pool.

Kelly watches from a distance as Alexa approaches, pretending to want food. Kelly confronts her about Luke and Justin, and Alexa lies, claiming that Justin called her and said he only wanted to be with Alexa. Kelly apologizes. Later, at a bar, the girls are dancing when Justin arrives and tries to get Kelly&#x27;s attention. She leaves, and he follows her, confronting her about her recent behavior. Kelly reveals what Alexa told her, and they argue. Kelly realizes something is amiss as Justin storms off. Back inside, Kelly picks up Alexa&#x27;s phone when it falls and discovers the messages between her and Justin. Alexa confesses to being jealous of the attention Kelly receives from guys. Kelly leaves, and Justin approaches her. Alexa tells Kelly she stopped Justin and admits to trying to keep them apart. She arranges for Justin and Kelly to reunite.

The following day, Justin and Kelly, Kaya and Carlos, Brandon and Cutler, and Eddie and Lizzie all dance at a pool party, enjoying their time together.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot; was produced within a relatively short timeframe of approximately two and a half months. During this period, three weeks were allocated for actor readings of the script, which were accompanied by ongoing script revisions. Additionally, this timeframe also encompassed rehearsals for dances and singing prior to the commencement of the six-week shooting schedule. R. J. Helton and Christina Christian, both former &quot;American Idol&quot; competitors, paid visits to the film&#x27;s set; however, they do not make appearances in the final cut of the movie.

==Release==
Some theater chains were concerned when distributor 20th Century Fox announced its intention to release the film on VHS and DVD a mere six weeks after its opening weekend. In response, they threatened not to screen the film at all. However, Fox eventually changed its stance and delayed the release by several months. Following a disappointing performance during its initial weekend, Fox decided to revert to the original release schedule, and the film was eventually made available to the public through home media on August 26, 2003.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In its opening weekend, &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot; grossed $2,715,848 in 2,001 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking #11 at the box office. By the end of its run on July 24, 2003, the film had grossed $4,928,883 in the domestic box office. Based on a $12 million budget, the film was a box-office bomb.

===Critical reception===
The film has a 8% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 63 reviews; the average rating is 3.2/10. The consensus states: &quot;A notorious stinker, &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot; features banal songs, a witless plot, and non-existent chemistry between its &quot;American Idol&quot;-sanctioned leads.&quot; The film has a score of 14 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote in his review, &quot;How bad is &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot;? Set in Miami during spring break, it&#x27;s like &quot;Grease: The Next Generation&quot; acted out by the food-court staff at SeaWorld.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine described the film as &quot;a monstrous &quot;Idol&quot; movie musical that in the most generous light is the worst film so far this century&quot;.

===Reception from Clarkson===
Clarkson has since stated that before the film went into production, she pleaded with the creator of &quot;American Idol&quot; to be relieved from the contractual obligation to star in the film and that she has always disliked &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot;. In an interview, she admitted participating in the film only because she was contractually obligated to do so: &quot;I knew when I read the script it was going to be real, real bad, but when I won, I signed that piece of paper, and I could not get out of it.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; as one of the 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.

The choreography was considered so bad that a special Golden Raspberry &quot;Governor&#x27;s Award&quot; was created as an excuse to present the film with a Razzie.

&quot;Total Film&quot; magazine ranked the film at number 16 in their list of &quot;66 Worst Movies Of All Time&quot;.

==Home media==
The DVD release includes an extended version of 90 minutes which has two new musical numbers, &quot;From Me to You&quot; and &quot;Brighter Star&quot;, additional lyrics, more sensual choreography to &quot;Wish Upon a Star&quot;, and a scene involving a &quot;Dare to Be Bare&quot; contest.

== Soundtrack ==
A commercial soundtrack with studio tracks was produced but remains unreleased due to the film&#x27;s negative reception and unsatisfactory box office returns. However, a version of the song &quot;Timeless&quot;, sung by Clarkson and Guarini, and recorded prior to the film, was included on Guarini&#x27;s self-titled debut album. The tracks of the unreleased studio soundtrack can be found on various Clarkson fan sites. Two songs, &quot;From Me to You&quot; and &quot;Brighter Star&quot;, did not appear in the theatrical release, but were added to the extended version DVD release. Clarkson also performed &quot;The Bounce (The Luv)&quot;, and &quot;Timeless&quot; during her shared (with Clay Aiken) &quot;Independent Tour&quot; in 2003 with her male backup singer performing the male vocals on &quot;Timeless&quot;.

<doc id="302759" wikidata="Q967556" url="?curid=302759" title="Jack Hobbs">
<text>Sir John Berry Hobbs (16 December 1882 – 21 December 1963) was an English professional cricketer who played for Surrey from 1905 to 1934 and for England in 61 Test matches between 1908 and 1930. Known as &quot;The Master&quot;, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket. He is the leading run-scorer and century-maker in first-class cricket, with 61,760 runs and 199 centuries. A right-handed batsman and an occasional right-arm medium pace bowler, Hobbs also excelled as a fielder, particularly in the position of cover point. Hobbs was named as one of the five &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketers of the Century alongside Sir Donald Bradman, Sir Garfield Sobers, Shane Warne, and Sir Viv Richards.

Born the eldest of 12 children to a Cambridge cricket groundsman and umpire in 1882, Hobbs wished from an early age to pursue a career in cricket from following his father&#x27;s matches at Cambridge University colleges, and playing for teams on Parker&#x27;s Piece.

His early batting was undistinguished, but a sudden improvement in 1901 brought him to the attention of local teams. In 1903, he successfully applied to join Surrey, with the support of England batsman Tom Hayward. His reputation grew and when he qualified to play for Surrey, he scored 88 on his first-class debut and a century in his next game. Over the following seasons, he established himself as a successful county player and in 1908 made his Test debut for England, scoring 83 in his first innings. After some mixed early performances for England, Hobbs&#x27; success against South African googly bowlers made his place secure, and by 1911–12, when he scored three centuries in the Test series against Australia, critics judged him the world&#x27;s best batsman. In county cricket, he developed an attacking, dynamic style of play and was very successful up until 1914. After serving in the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War, he maintained his reputation when cricket resumed in 1919, but his career was threatened by appendicitis, which caused him to miss most of the 1921 season. When he returned, he was a more cautious batsman and used a safer style of play. Subsequently, he became more consistent and scored prolifically in both Test and domestic cricket until his retirement. During this period, he played some of his most acclaimed innings.

Hobbs&#x27; success was based on fast footwork, an ability to play many different shots, and excellent placement of the ball. Among the first batsmen to succeed against previously devastating googly bowlers, he adapted his technique to meet the new styles of bowling that arose early in his career; he mixed classical shots with an effective defence. He was particularly successful on difficult pitches for batting. An opening batsman, Hobbs established several effective opening partnerships; with Tom Hayward and Andy Sandham for Surrey and with Wilfred Rhodes and Herbert Sutcliffe for England. Despite batting against &quot;ruthless bowlers on very hostile pitches with [fewer] safety regulations&quot;, his partnership with Sutcliffe remains in 2022 the highest average for a first-wicket partnership in Test history by a wide margin. Contemporaries rated Hobbs extremely highly, and critics continue to list him among the best batsmen of all time.

Hobbs was very close to Ada, his wife of 56 years; the pair were able to live comfortably in later life through Hobbs&#x27; substantial wage from Surrey, his commercial endorsements, and the proceeds of the sporting goods shop he opened in 1921 and ran for nearly the rest of his life. 

After his cricketing retirement, he also worked in journalism. Knighted in 1953 — the first professional cricketer to be so honoured — he spent his later years nursing his wife. He died, aged 81, a few months after her in 1963.

==Early life==
===Childhood and early cricket===

Hobbs was born in Cambridge on 16 December 1882, the first of 12 children to John Cooper Hobbs, a slater, and his wife Flora Matilda Berry. Hobbs was raised in a poor, run-down area of the city, and he spent most of his childhood in near poverty. Hobbs senior, a lover of cricket, changed his career to become a professional cricketer, and in 1889 was appointed groundsman and umpire at Jesus College.

From an early age, Hobbs played cricket whenever he could. His first games were played in the streets near his house. He was educated at a primary school affiliated with his local Anglican church, St Matthew&#x27;s, and moved in 1891 to York Street Boys&#x27; School, a fee-paying establishment; Hobbs later admitted to being a poor scholar but was successful at sports. He played cricket regularly for the St Matthew&#x27;s choir team and the York Street school team, and during holidays helped his father at Jesus College. In his final year at York Street, to supplement the family budget, Hobbs took a job working before school hours in the domestic service of a private house. On leaving school in 1895, he worked as an errand boy until his father&#x27;s connections at the university secured him a summer job as a college servant, chiefly assisting the cricket team. Aged 16, Hobbs became an apprentice gas fitter, and practised cricket on Parker&#x27;s Piece, an open area of common land in Cambridge, in his spare time. He played for various local clubs but did not initially stand out as a cricketer: although better than most other Cambridge batsmen, no coaches or major teams approached him, and his batting gave little indication of the success which came later.

Hobbs&#x27; breakthrough came in 1901. His batting improved throughout the season, during which he scored 102 for Ainsworth against the Cambridge Liberals, his first century. At the end of the season, he was included in a Cambridge XI, a team chosen from the best local cricketers, to play a prestigious match against a team of professional cricketers brought by the Cambridge-born Surrey cricketer Tom Hayward. Hobbs&#x27; overall record was unremarkable, but at the end of the season he was invited to play as an amateur for Cambridgeshire; he achieved little in his appearances.

Early in 1902, Hobbs was appointed as assistant to the professional cricket coach at Bedford School, working as a groundsman and bowling in the nets. In late August, he returned to Cambridge to play as a professional for the first time. For a fee of ten shillings, Hobbs appeared for a team from the nearby town of Royston against Hertfordshire Club and Ground and scored 119 runs. His success delighted his family and made him a local celebrity. Hobbs&#x27; father, who had helped to arrange his appearance in the match, died from pneumonia a week later. Despite local fund-raising efforts for the bereaved family, Hobbs senior&#x27;s death left his wife and children facing great financial hardship. Francis Hutt, a former friend and colleague of the father, contacted Essex County Cricket Club to request a trial for Hobbs. That county never replied—Hobbs later scored his maiden first-class century against them—but Hutt was more successful when he asked Hayward to look at Hobbs with a view to recommending him to Surrey. Consequently, in late 1902, Hobbs batted on Parker&#x27;s Piece against Hayward and Bill Reeves, an Essex cricketer born in Cambridge, impressing Hayward in the process. In the winter of 1902–03 Hobbs assumed his father&#x27;s duties as groundsman at Jesus College.

===Surrey cricketer===
Hobbs was summoned to Surrey for a trial in April 1903, and subsequently offered a contract with the ground staff at the Oval on a basic wage during the season of 30 shillings a week. Hobbs could not immediately play for Surrey owing to the qualification rules in place at the time for the County Championship—a player had to be born in a county or to have lived there for two years in order to represent it. To achieve qualification, he moved to the Surrey area of London. Around this time he played football for local teams as a forward with some success, but struggled financially during the winter months and found it hard to find employment.

While qualifying, Hobbs played for Surrey&#x27;s Colts side and for the Club and Ground Eleven, both of which were teams for young cricketers. Although he made some substantial scores, according to his biographer, Leo McKinstry, &quot;just as he had done for much of his early life, [Hobbs] performed satisfactorily without doing anything startling&quot;. In the 1903 season he scored 480 runs at an average of 34.29, as well as taking 19 wickets as his bowling improved. The following season, Hobbs played only for the Club and Ground, increased his average to 43.90, and impressed people connected with the Surrey county side. His sudden improvement brought about a temporary return to the Cambridgeshire team, for which he remained qualified by birth. His batting was praised, particularly when he scored 195 and 129 in two matches against Hertfordshire. In total, he scored 696 runs in 13 innings for Cambridgeshire, averaging 58.00.

==First-class cricketer==
By the start of the 1905 season, Hobbs had qualified for Surrey and was already being noted as a player of promise. At the time, Surrey needed an opening batsman to partner Tom Hayward. Although Hobbs had rarely opened the batting, he was selected as Hayward&#x27;s opening partner for Surrey&#x27;s first game of the season. He made his debut on 24 April 1905 against a team representing the &quot;Gentlemen of England&quot;; after scoring 18 runs in the first innings, he scored a rapid 88 in the second before rain ensured the match was drawn. The Surrey team and committee were impressed, and Hobbs retained his place for the club&#x27;s opening County Championship match against Essex. When he scored 155 runs in around three hours during Surrey&#x27;s second innings, the Surrey captain Lord Dalmeny awarded Hobbs his County Cap. Over the following weeks, Hobbs scored consistently, hitting another century against Essex and 94 runs against the touring Australian cricket team. But a combination of fatigue from continuous cricket and the pressure of first-class cricket adversely affected his form, and he struggled for the remainder of the season even as the county tried various measures to help him. In first-class cricket that season, Hobbs scored 1,317 runs at an average of 25.82, including two centuries and four other scores over fifty, to finish ninth in the Surrey batting averages. As an occasional medium-paced bowler, he took six wickets. Reviewing Surrey&#x27;s season, &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; singled Hobbs out for attention, praising his early-season form; it suggested that he was the best professional batsman Surrey had found for a long time. &quot;The Times&quot; noted that, while performing well, Hobbs had fallen short of the standards suggested by his start.

After a winter of practice, Hobbs displayed greater consistency in 1906. Displaying a wider range of shots, he scored four centuries, including another against Essex, and established an effective opening partnership with Hayward. Between his debut and Hayward&#x27;s retirement in 1914, the pair shared 40 opening partnerships in excess of 100 runs. Hobbs was generally the junior partner, and was overawed by Hayward, to the extent that he did not feel confident enough to invite him to his wedding. Hayward influenced Hobbs&#x27; mental approach, particularly his running between the wickets, but the pair were dissimilar in style. In all first-class cricket in 1906, Hobbs scored 1,913 runs at an average of 40.70 with a highest score of 162, placing him second in the Surrey averages. &quot;Wisden&quot; praised his improved fielding and commented that he was &quot;one of the best professional bats of the year&quot;. Hobbs made further advances in 1907. Unusually frequent rain during the season—&quot;Wisden&quot; described the season as the wettest ever—meant that pitches often favoured bowlers. After a poor start, Hobbs successfully adapted to the conditions, and scored consistently well. In June, he and Hayward shared four century opening partnerships in one week. Hobbs scored four centuries in total and by the end of the season had scored 2,135 runs, averaging 37.45. He was one of only three men to pass 2,000 runs; he was second to Hayward in the Surrey averages, and eighth nationally. His performances brought him to the attention of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) selectors, and he was chosen for the Players in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players matches in July, although he scored few runs in either game.

==Test match cricketer==

===First appearances===
Hobbs was selected to tour Australia in the 1907–08 season with an MCC team, given his opportunity by the unavailability of several leading players. Throughout the outward voyage, Hobbs was severely affected by sea-sickness, a condition which afflicted him on sea voyages throughout his life; in later tours, he travelled overland as far as possible to reduce his time on ships. Consequently, he missed the first two games of the tour against the Australian state teams. His appearances were further limited by the reluctance of the MCC captain, Arthur Jones, to select him. He played in only two of the early matches, failing on both occasions, and was left out of the team for the first Test match. After England lost the game, Hobbs was chosen for the second Test. Hobbs made his Test debut on 1January 1908 at Melbourne Cricket Ground. Opening the England batting on the second day, Hobbs scored 83 runs in 182 minutes. Eventually, England needed 282 to win and did so by one wicket; Hobbs scored 28. He retained his place for the rest of the series. In the fourth match, he scored 57 on a pitch badly affected by rain; by adopting a policy of attacking the bowling he hit ten fours. He concluded his series with an innings of 72 in the final game, but could not prevent a third successive English defeat—the home side won the five-match series 4–1. He scored 302 runs in the Tests at an average of 43.14. In other first-class matches, he scored centuries against Tasmania and Victoria, totalling 876 runs at 41.71.

Hobbs scored fewer runs in 1908, despite better conditions for batting. Even so, he scored 81 in the Gentlemen v Players game, achieved a batting average over 40 in the County Championship and scored six centuries for Surrey. In all first-class games, Hobbs scored 1,904 runs at 37.33. For his achievements that season, Hobbs was chosen as one of &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; Cricketers of the Year. The citation noted that &quot;at the present time there is perhaps no better professional batsman in England except Hayward and Tyldesley&quot;.

Hobbs began the 1909 season with a succession of large scores, including a double century in one match and two separate centuries in another. Such form placed him in contention for a place in the England team to play Australia that year, despite the English batting strength. But the England captain, Archie MacLaren, was unconvinced that Hobbs possessed the required quality. The Surrey captain and England selector H. D. G. Leveson Gower persuaded the committee to include Hobbs in the squad, then convinced a reluctant MacLaren to play him in the team. In the first Test, played at Edgbaston, Hobbs opened the batting with MacLaren but was dismissed from the first ball he received. The match was a low-scoring one, and Australia set England 105 runs to win. Hobbs, this time opening the batting with C. B. Fry, hit 62 not out and England passed the target without losing a wicket. England lost the next two matches, and Hobbs was unsuccessful, with a top-score of 30 in four innings. A badly injured finger meant that he missed the remainder of the Test series; in three games, he scored 132 runs at an average of 26.40. England lost the series when the remaining two matches were drawn. Hobbs struggled to regain his form when he recovered; he averaged 40.65 for the season, but of the 2,114 first-class runs he scored, nearly half came in the first month of the season.

===Dominance in South Africa===
Hobbs accepted an invitation to tour South Africa that winter with the MCC. The cricketing conditions were challenging: matches were played on matting pitches, unfamiliar to English players, and the South African googly bowlers had previously troubled most leading English batsmen, provoking debate over how batsmen could combat the new delivery. The MCC captain, Leveson Gower, selected Wilfred Rhodes to open the batting with Hobbs for the first Test. Rhodes, a defensively-minded batsman who excelled at taking quick singles, had begun his career as a bowler who batted down the order. He steadily improved his batting, eventually becoming an opening batsman. Hobbs and Rhodes, between 1910 and 1921, opened the batting 36 times for England and shared eight century partnerships; their average of 61.31 runs per opening partnership remains the second highest in Test history. In other first-class cricket, they shared a further five century opening partnerships. Their association was notable for effective running; the pair developed such an unusually good understanding that they were able to run without calling to each other. They scored singles by pushing the ball just past nearby fielders and running quickly. Critics believed that they raised the art of running to a new level.

This tactic developed from the first day that Hobbs and Rhodes batted together in the first Test; they added 159 runs for the first wicket. Hobbs scored 89 in the first innings and 35 in the second, and while England lost narrowly, he appeared much more comfortable than the other English batsmen against the googly. Hobbs and Rhodes shared a partnership of 207 in the tour match following the Test, in which Hobbs scored 163. England also lost the second Test, but Hobbs scored 53 and 70, sharing two substantial opening partnerships with Rhodes. The failure of the other batsmen, defeated by the googly bowlers, caused consternation in the English press. As England had few effective pace bowlers on the tour, Hobbs opened the bowling in the first two Tests, as well as the batting. In the third Test, he scored 93 not out to guide England to a three-wicket victory. However, the series was lost when England were defeated in the fourth match; Hobbs scored 0and 1, the only time in his Test career that he failed to reach double figures in either innings, and his worst match return in first-class cricket. In the final game of the series, he scored his first Test hundred, opening the batting and sharing a partnership of 221 with Rhodes which was a record at the time for the first wicket in Test matches. Hobbs scored 187, an innings praised by &quot;Wisden&quot; for its &quot;brilliancy&quot;. In this match he once more opened the bowling, dismissing Reggie Schwarz, his only Test wicket. England won the match by nine wickets and the series finished 3–2 against them. Hobbs scored 1,124 first-class runs at an average of 66.11 on the tour, while in the Test matches, he scored 539 runs at 67.37. None of the other English batsmen came close to matching his success against the googly, and by the end of the series, critics were beginning to describe him as the world&#x27;s leading batsman. &quot;Wisden&quot; commented: &quot;Beyond everything else from the English point of view the feature of the trip was the superb batting of Hobbs, who easily adapted himself to the matting wickets and scored from the famous googly bowlers with amazing skill and facility. When they came home the other members of the team could not say too much in his praise.&quot;

Fatigue from the South African tour affected Hobbs in 1910. He scored 1,982 runs at an average of 33.03, the lowest average of his career apart from his first season. More effective during 1911, after a long rest during the winter, Hobbs was consistently successful in a hot, dry summer which produced good batting pitches. He played few large innings, but was very effective in high-pressure games, and scored 2,376 runs at 41.68. Bowling more frequently than in other seasons, Hobbs took 28 first-class wickets. Against Oxford University, Hobbs bowled throughout the second innings to take seven wickets for 56 runs, the best figures of his career.

===Success against Australia===
Hobbs was an automatic selection for the MCC tour of Australia in the winter of 1911–12. During the first Test, which Australia won by 146 runs, Hobbs scored 63 in the first innings, although by his own admission he did not play well. Rhodes was in the team, but did not open the batting owing to his poor form; Hobbs opened with Septimus Kinneir. England recovered to win the second Test; after bowling Australia out for 184 and taking a first-innings lead of 81, the visiting team eventually faced a target of 219 to win. Hobbs and Rhodes, restored to the opening position, began with a partnership of 57. Hobbs scored 126 not out, his first century against Australia, and scored particularly well from the bowling of H. V. &quot;Ranji&quot; Hordern, a googly bowler who had taken 12 wickets in the first Test. &quot;Wisden&quot; commented that Hobbs &quot;played one of the finest innings of his life&quot;, and England won by eight wickets. Australia were once more bowled out for a low score in the third Test; this time Hobbs and Rhodes added 147 for the first wicket and Hobbs scored 187. England reached a total of 501 and won the match by seven wickets.
Having established a lead in the series, England began the fourth Test by bowling Australia out for 191. At the end of the first day, Hobbs and Rhodes had scored 54 together, and the next day they took their partnership for the first wicket to 323, setting a new record for the highest partnership for any wicket in Test matches. Their partnership remained an overall Test record for 22 years and the highest for the first wicket until 1948. As of 2016, this remains England&#x27;s highest opening partnership against Australia. The pair scored easily from the bowling but faced criticism for slow batting. Even so, Hobbs reached a century in 133 minutes and proceeded to play more aggressively afterwards. He was finally dismissed for 178. England reached a total of 589 and bowled Australia out for 173 to win the match by an innings and regain the Ashes. England also won the final Test to take the series 4–1; Hobbs scored 32 and 45, sharing a partnership of 76 with Rhodes in the second innings. Hobbs ended the series with an aggregate of 662 runs at an average of 82.75, setting a new record number of runs for an individual batsman in a Test series. His average was far greater than any other batsman on either team, and the tour established him as the world&#x27;s best batsman. In addition, in all first-class matches he ran out 15 batsmen while fielding at cover point. The Australians did not dare run when he fielded the ball for fear of the speed of his throw. In all first-class matches, Hobbs scored 943 runs at 55.47.

The 1912 season was unusually wet, which resulted in some very difficult pitches for batting. &quot;Wisden&quot; remarked that Hobbs did not bat particularly well for Surrey. The press criticised him for trying to score too quickly and losing his wicket in the process. During the summer, both Australia and South Africa toured England, taking part in the Triangular Tournament. Hobbs made a slow start to the competition when he was bowled in the first over in England&#x27;s opening match, and his form was uncertain in the early part of the season. However, he scored a century against Australia at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground on a very difficult batting pitch in England&#x27;s second game, sharing a partnership of 112 with Rhodes. He continued with scores of 55 and 68 in the next two games against South Africa, and his batting was praised by the press; for the first time, in the &quot;Times&quot;, he was referred to as &quot;a great master&quot;. South Africa were defeated in five of their six games (the other was drawn). As the first two games between England and Australia were drawn, the final match was designated as the deciding match for the tournament. Hobbs and Rhodes opened with 107, and Hobbs scored 66. These runs were crucial and England won the game by 244 runs. Hobbs had the best batting average for the summer from all three teams; he averaged 40.75 against South Africa and 56.00 against Australia. In all first-class cricket his aggregate was 2,042 runs at 37.81.

===Years before the war===
In 1913, batting in a more controlled fashion, Hobbs scored 2,605 runs at an average of 50.09, placing him second in the national averages. He continued to score quickly, twice scoring 100 runs before lunch on the first day of a match; against Worcestershire, he and Hayward shared an opening partnership of 313 in 190 minutes. In the winter of 1913–14, the MCC sent a strong team to South Africa. The opposition team lacked effective players, and England won the five-Test series 4–0, mainly as a result of the bowling of Sydney Barnes. Hobbs scored 443 runs at an average of 63.28 in the series; he did not score a century, but accumulated scores of 82, 92 and 97, while he and Rhodes shared two century opening partnerships and another of 92. Hobbs adopted a cautious approach, and &quot;Wisden&quot; noted that he was &quot;not quite so brilliant as in England&quot; but said that he was &quot;an absolute master on matting wickets [pitches].&quot; In all first-class matches, he scored 1,489 runs at 74.45.

After a slow start to the 1914 season, Hobbs recorded a string of centuries, including a score of 226, his highest at that time. The looming First World War overshadowed much of the season. Cricket initially continued once the war began, but as the Oval had been requisitioned by the military, Hobbs&#x27; benefit match was moved from the Oval to Lord&#x27;s. This move, and the public&#x27;s preoccupation with the war, consigned the game to a financial failure; in total, Hobbs&#x27; benefit raised £657 (£80,663 in 2021 terms), lower than most benefits and far less than usually raised for cricketers of Hobbs&#x27; standing. The Surrey committee agreed to give him another benefit when the war concluded. Hobbs scored his 11th century of the season before public pressure terminated the cricket season. During the winter, the MCC declared Surrey as County Champions; although the war prevented the completion of all the matches, Surrey led comfortably enough for the other counties not to object. This was the only time in Hobbs&#x27; career that Surrey were champions. In all first-class games in 1914, he scored 2,697 runs at 58.63. As the war began, Hobbs reputation was at its peak; he was described by &quot;Wisden&quot; as &quot;one of the greatest bats of his generation&quot;. McKinstry states that during the season: &quot;With his free-scoring method, [Hobbs] had dazzled in a way that he was never to do again.&quot;

==First World War==
Unlike many other cricketers, Hobbs did not immediately join the army, but worked in a munitions factory, possibly as a clerk. Writing later, Hobbs related that he was criticised for not joining up, but suggested he did not realise how serious the war would be, and was conscious of the need to care for his family. From March 1915 he found extra work as coach at Westminster School, and in May began to play on Saturdays as a professional for Idle in the Bradford Cricket League. The continuation of competitive cricket in Bradford, when all other such cricket had ceased, was controversial. Several clubs hired top-class professionals and matches became very popular. Although his arrival was eagerly anticipated, Hobbs never reached the expected heights, averaging 36.63 throughout the 1915 season. But his signing provoked an angry exchange of correspondence between the Yorkshire president Lord Hawke, who was highly critical of the employment of professionals, and John Booth, the president of the Bradford League. Hobbs never publicly commented on the matter, but was instrumental in recruiting Frank Woolley to play in the league. He continued to play for Idle in 1916, and was more successful, scoring 790 runs at 52.60 and taking 65 wickets at 6.27. But his conscription after the season into the Royal Flying Corps ended his regular cricket in the league.

Hobbs joined the Corps in October 1916 as an air mechanic and after training was posted to London, then Norfolk; at first he had time to appear in charity cricket matches and in several games for Idle. In November 1917, he joined 110 Squadron which remained in England despite plans to send it to France. By 1918, the cricket authorities began to arrange more matches and Hobbs played successfully several times at Lord&#x27;s. In September 1918, 110 Squadron, as part of the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF), was sent to France and took an active part in the fighting, but Hobbs never discussed his career in the RAF. Even so, some of his family remained critical and felt that the worst of the war was over when Hobbs went to France. He was demobilised in February 1919, three months after the Armistice with Germany which ended the war.

==Career after the war==
===Resumption of cricket===

When first-class cricket resumed in 1919, Surrey awarded Hobbs a five-year contract worth £400 a year (£24,185 in 2021 money). During the season, he began to open the batting with Andy Sandham, who succeeded to Hayward&#x27;s position as Hobbs&#x27; partner; in the following years, the pair established an effective partnership. In total, they shared 66 century opening partnerships and averaged over 50 for the first wicket. Like Hobbs&#x27; other successful partnerships, this one was based on quick running. Sandham, even when successful, was often overshadowed by his partner; on one occasion, Sandham scored a century but the headlines were reserved for Hobbs&#x27; duck. Sandham usually played the subordinate role and Hobbs took most of the bowling.

Hobbs made a good start to the 1919 season and, despite a brief spell of failure through over-aggression, batted consistently. He scored a double century for Surrey against a touring Australian Imperial Forces cricket team and centuries in each of the three Gentlemen v Players matches—the only player ever to do so in one season. His rescheduled benefit match raised £1,670 (£91,750 in 2021 terms), money he used to open a sports shop in London. The shop was successful, and he ran it until just before his death. The additional income gave him considerable financial independence. In total that year, Hobbs scored 2,594 runs in first-class matches, more than anyone else, at an average of 60.32. After a winter working in his shop, his good form continued into 1920. Four of his eleven first-class centuries came in consecutive innings in June, and he totalled 2,827 runs at 58.89. He also took five wickets for 21 runs against Warwickshire, and his 17 wickets at an average of 11.82 placed him at the top of the Surrey bowling averages.

Hobbs toured Australia with the MCC during the 1920–21 season, under the captaincy of J. W. H. T. Douglas, when Australia won every match of the five-Test series. He was one of the few English successes. He scored two centuries in the opening three first-class games, and in the first Test top-scored in both England innings with 49 and 59. In the second Test, he scored 122 on a difficult pitch which had been affected by rain. &quot;Wisden&quot; commented that this was &quot;from the English point of view, the finest innings of the tour&quot;. He also scored a century in defeat in the third Test, hitting 123 in the final innings as England failed to score 489 to win the game. He did not pass 50 again in the series; after a failure on the fourth Test, he tore a thigh muscle batting in a game before the final Test. Persuaded by Douglas to play anyway, he scored 40 and 34 but struggled to field effectively. One unsuccessful attempt to chase the ball caused some of the crowd to jeer him, which led to controversy when two amateur members of the team, Percy Fender and Rockley Wilson, wrote scathingly about the incident. Hobbs scored a total of 924 first-class runs on the tour, at an average of 51.33; in Test matches, he scored 505 runs at 50.50. Although he and Rhodes resumed their opening partnership, apart from in the first Test, when C. A. G. Russell partnered Hobbs, they could not replicate their former successes, and shared only one stand worth more than fifty.

Hobbs played just five first-class matches in 1921, when Australia toured England. In his opening first-class game, he played against the touring team, but tore the same thigh muscle injured in Australia. He missed the opening two Tests, but once recovered, scored a century for Surrey; as England trailed 2–0 in the five-Test series, the selectors chose him for the third Test. In the days approaching the match, played in Leeds, he suffered from increasing stomach pain but reluctantly played. On the first day of the match, he had to leave the field, and after a day of rest the pain worsened. He consulted Sir Berkley Moynihan, a prominent surgeon based in Leeds, who diagnosed acute appendicitis and operated the same day. In the opinion of the surgeon, Hobbs would not have lived another five hours without surgery. He missed the rest of the season.

Hobbs returned to cricket in 1922 and batted effectively throughout the first months of the season, scoring 10 first-class centuries in total. One of the centuries came in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord&#x27;s, in which he captained the Players team for the first time. Towards the end of the season, his form faded owing to the lingering effects of his illness and operation the previous year. &quot;Wisden&quot; observed that he frequently tired during longer innings and often tried to get out soon after reaching three figures; this habit of giving up his innings continued throughout the remainder of his career. The season also marked a turning point in his batting approach where he preferred to score more slowly and take fewer risks, in contrast to his adventurous pre-war tactics. Second in the national batting averages for 1922, he scored 2,552 runs at an average of 62.24, but declined an invitation to tour South Africa that winter with the MCC. Less successful during the wet 1923 season, Hobbs failed on many occasions and was unsuccessful in both Gentlemenv Players games. He was still struggling with the after-effects of his operation and &quot;Wisden&quot; noticed he once more tried to score too quickly early in an innings. However, against Somerset, he scored the 100th century of his first-class career, the third man to reach the landmark after W. G. Grace and Hayward. Overall in the season, he scored 2,087 runs at 37.95.

===Partnership with Sutcliffe===

Hobbs signed a new contract worth £440 (£28,463 in 2021 terms) a season before the 1924 season. His form recovered to the extent that his biographer, John Arlott, described it as the beginning of &quot;his quite phenomenal second lease of cricketing life&quot;. Batting conditions were good throughout the summer and Hobbs&#x27; opening partnership with Sandham for Surrey began to approach its peak of effectiveness. Hobbs also established an opening partnership with Yorkshire&#x27;s Herbert Sutcliffe; the pair had opened together briefly in previous seasons and were chosen to open in a Test trial early in 1924, beginning a six-year Test association. They were often successful in difficult batting conditions; Hobbs, generally the dominant partner, usually faced more of the bowling. By the time of his retirement, they had opened the batting 38 times in Tests, shared 15 century opening partnerships, and added 3,249 runs together; their average partnership was 87.81, the highest in all Tests for a pair of opening batsmen as of 2016. In all first-class matches, they had added 100 for the first wicket 26 times and had an average partnership of over 77. As with Hobbs&#x27; other partnerships, they ran well between the wickets, and established a particular reputation for reliability; according to McKinstry, they became an &quot;English institution&quot;. The cricket writer Gerald Howat suggests that Hobbs and Sutcliffe&#x27; became almost a synonym for English stability.&quot;

Following their success in the 1924 trial match, Hobbs and Sutcliffe were selected for the England team to play the first Test against South Africa. When England batted first, the pair added 136 for the first wicket; Hobbs, playing a Test innings in England for the first time since 1912, scored 76. England won the match by a large margin. In the second Test, Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened with 268 runs for the first wicket; Hobbs scored 211, his highest Test score. At the time, the innings was the highest played at Lord&#x27;s in a Test and equalled the highest in a Test match in England. England scored 531 for the loss of two wickets and won the match by an innings. Having initially declined an invitation to tour Australia with the MCC in the coming winter, Hobbs was left out of the team for the fourth Test. After the MCC accepted his request to allow his wife Ada to accompany him—the wives of professionals were not usually permitted to tour—he changed his mind, and was added to the England team for the fifth Test. In the series, he scored 355 runs at an average of 71.00, while in all first-class matches he totalled 2,094 runs at 58.16. He finished second in the national averages, and the cricket press noted that, although Hobbs scored more slowly and in less spectacular fashion than previously, he batted in a safer, secure style which was more successful in terms of run-scoring.

The MCC team which toured Australia under the captaincy of Arthur Gilligan in 1924–25 lost the Test series 4–1, but critics thought the winning margin flattered the host country. Between them in the Test matches, Hobbs and Sutcliffe scored seven centuries and shared four opening partnerships which passed 100 runs. Hobbs began the tour well, and scored consistently in the matches before the Tests. In the first Test, in reply to Australia&#x27;s first innings of 450, Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened with 157 runs. Hobbs went on to his seventh century against Australia, beating the previous record number in England-Australia Tests by Victor Trumper. Australia eventually set England a target of 605 runs. Hobbs and Sutcliffe shared their second century opening partnership of the game, but England lost by 193 runs. During the match, Hobbs became the leading run-scorer in Test cricket, passing the previous record of 3,412 runs set by Clem Hill in 1912. In the second Test, Australia scored 600 during the opening two days. In reply, Hobbs and Sutcliffe batted throughout the third day without being separated, scoring 283. They concentrated on defence but both men reached centuries, and the press praised their achievements. Even so, Australia won the game by 81 runs, and in the aftermath of the defeat, Cecil Parkin, a former Test bowler and vocal critic of Gilligan&#x27;s captaincy, wrote a newspaper article suggesting that Hobbs should assume the leadership of the side. This suggestion provoked a reaction from Lord Hawke—&quot;Pray God, no professional will ever captain England&quot;—and subsequent press debate over the idea of Hobbs as captain. In reality, Hobbs had no desire to captain England.

Australia once more batted first in the third Test, scoring 489. For tactical reasons, Hobbs did not open the batting but scored 119 and shared another century partnership with Sutcliffe. Wet weather altered the course of the match and, despite an opening partnership of 63 between Hobbs and Sutcliffe, Australia won by 11 runs. The opening batsmen shared their fourth century partnership of the series in the fourth Test as England won by an innings, but Australia won the final match to win the series 4–1 and in a heavy defeat, Hobbs failed in both innings. In the series, he scored 573 runs at an average of 63.66, and made two half-centuries in addition to his three hundreds. Critics in Australia and England once more recognised him as the leading batsman in the world. Hobbs and Sutcliffe far outscored the remaining MCC batsmen and &quot;Wisden&quot; judged that with better support from other batsmen they could have won the series. In all games, Hobbs scored 865 first-class runs at 54.06.

===Peak of popularity===
Hobbs was particularly successful in 1925. Early in the season a string of centuries, including a run of four in consecutive innings, made him the first batman to reach 1,000 runs that season and brought him close to Grace&#x27;s record of 126 first-class hundreds. He scored the 125th century of his career against Kent on 20 July, but amid intense press and public interest, Hobbs lost form through a combination of anxiety and fatigue. He continued to score well, but could not reach three figures in an innings—after one innings of 54, a newspaper headline proclaimed that &quot;Hobbs Fails Again&quot;. It was not until 15 August, against Somerset, that Hobbs scored 101 to reach the landmark, an achievement praised and feted throughout the country over the following weeks. On the final day of the match, Hobbs scored another century to become the outright record holder. He ended his season with an innings of 266 in a Gentlemen v Players match at the Scarborough Festival, his highest to date and the best score made in the Gentlemen v Players series, and 104 for the Rest of England against Yorkshire, the County Champions. In total, he scored 16 centuries—setting a record for most centuries in a season—and totalled 3,024 runs at an average of 70.32 to top the national averages for the first time. Following his successful season, Hobbs was in great demand. He attended several functions in his honour but rejected offers to appear on stage, in film and to stand as a Liberal parliamentary candidate.
Hobbs was given a third benefit by Surrey in 1926, which raised £2670 (£173,651 in 2021 terms). Further recognition came when he and Rhodes joined the England selection committee for the Ashes series to be played that summer; for professional cricketers to serve as England selectors was unprecedented. Hobbs began the season well, and after the first Test, which was badly affected by rain, he remained in form by scoring 261 against Oxford University, sharing an opening partnership of 428 with Sandham; this remained a Surrey first wicket record as of 2016. In the drawn second Test, he and Sutcliffe shared an opening stand of 182. Hobbs scored 119 but was criticised for slowing down later in his innings, leading to accusations that he was more concerned with reaching three figures than batting for the team. The third Test was also drawn. England followed on in the face of a large Australian total, but Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened the second innings with a partnership of 156 and Hobbs scored 88 as the game was saved. During the fourth Test, he temporarily assumed the captaincy when Arthur Carr withdrew from the match owing to illness; Hobbs became the first professional to captain England at home. The selectors and players on both teams believed Hobbs performed well tactically. He scored 74 in England&#x27;s innings, but heavy rain ensured a fourth successive draw.

As everything depended on the final game, the Imperial Cricket Conference agreed that the match be played to a finish. Carr was replaced as captain by Percy Chapman, a decision which proved controversial in the press; Rhodes was also recalled to the team, aged 48. Amid huge public interest, the match was evenly balanced at the end of the second day when England began their second innings. Overnight rain seriously damaged the pitch before the third morning and few critics—including members of the home team—expected England to score many runs. But Hobbs and Sutcliffe, who had scored 49 on the second evening, began to bat confidently before the effects of a hot sun drying a damp pitch made batting even more hazardous. Concentrating on defence, but scoring whenever possible, the pair added 172 in total. Immediately after reaching 100, Hobbs was out and received a prolonged ovation from the crowd. Many critics believed that, given the conditions, match situation and pressure, this was his greatest innings. England built up a large lead and bowled Australia out to win the Ashes. Late in the season, Hobbs made the highest score of his career, 316 not out for Surrey against Middlesex at Lord&#x27;s, establishing a record individual innings for Lord&#x27;s which survived until 1990. In total, Hobbs scored 2,949 runs at 77.60, including 12 centuries, to be placed first in the national batting averages.

Hobbs missed a large part of the 1927 season with a combination of illness and injury. In between his absences, he performed well, although he was left out of the Gentlemen v Players match. He scored 1,641 runs at 52.93, including seven centuries. He began the 1928 season with four centuries in the first month, but another leg injury kept him out of cricket for six weeks. When he recovered, he was selected in the last two of the three Tests against the West Indies, playing their first Test series. In his first game, he and Sutcliffe shared a century partnership; in the third, Hobbs scored 159, having opened with a 155-run partnership with Sutcliffe. England won the series 3–0. Hobbs maintained his batting form until the end of the season; he finished second in the batting averages, scoring 2,542 runs at an average of 82.00 and hitting 12 centuries. Critics believed he remained unsurpassed among English batsmen.

===Final Tests===

Hobbs toured Australia for a final time as a player in 1928–29 as part of a strong MCC team, and despite substantial scores in early games, did not bat well. He made little contribution to England&#x27;s victories in the first two Tests, and some critics noticed a decline in his batting, a judgement reinforced when he was out to a poorly-chosen shot in the first innings of the third Test for 20. Australia were able to build up a substantial lead, and overnight rain before the sixth day of the match made them likely winners. England needed 332 to win, but on a pitch growing more difficult as it dried, a total of 100 was considered unlikely. Hobbs and Sutcliffe survived to add 105 for the first wicket; observers praised their technique against the turning ball, although the Australian bowlers were criticised for ineffective tactics. Hobbs was out for 49; at his suggestion, Douglas Jardine came in to bat next, and England reached the end of the day having lost just one wicket for a score of 199. Next day, the team won the game to take a 3–0 lead in the series with two to play and ensure they retained the Ashes. In the fourth Test, Hobbs scored 74 and shared a partnership of 143 with Sutcliffe as England won by 12 runs; in the final game, won by Australia, he scored 142 on the first day, his final Test century and 12th against Australia. Scoring his hundred at the age of 46 years 82 days, he remained as of 2016 the oldest player to score a Test century. In first-class games on the tour, Hobbs scored 962 runs at 56.58. and 451 runs at 50.11 in the Tests.

Hobbs missed more cricket with injuries and illnesses in 1929; between 1926 and 1930, he missed more than a third of Surrey&#x27;s matches. However, he scored heavily and compiled 2,263 runs at an average of 66.55 to lead the first-class averages. Unfit for the first two Tests against South Africa, he chose to miss the next two, and played in the final game, scoring 10 and 52. Critics observed a general slowing in Hobbs&#x27; scoring throughout the season, and he scored more often in singles than in his earlier years.

Hobbs began 1930 in good form, and, with Rhodes, was added to the selection panel again for the Ashes series that season. In the first Test, Hobbs scored 78 and 74; he top-scored in both innings, but failed in the next two Tests. Before the third and fourth Tests, feeling tired and concerned by his form, he offered to stand down but the other selectors declined his suggestion. When he batted in the fourth Test, he shared an opening partnership of 108 with Sutcliffe, their 11th century stand against Australia. After two hours batting, he was out for 31. With the series level at 1–1, the final Test was to be played to a finish, but before it began, Hobbs announced that it would be his last. Shortly after making the decision, he returned to form, scoring a century and passing, in his next game, W. G. Grace&#x27;s record career-aggregate of 54,896 first-class runs. Before the deciding Test, the selectors sacked Percy Chapman as captain. The press speculated that Hobbs would replace him, but Bob Wyatt was chosen; Hobbs may have turned down an offer of the captaincy at the meeting of selectors. In the match, Hobbs scored 47 in the first innings. When he came out to bat in the second, in the face of a large Australian first-innings lead, Hobbs was given an ovation by the crowd and the Australian fielders gave him three cheers. Hobbs was moved by his reception but scored only nine runs before he was dismissed, and Australia won the match and series. In his final series, he scored 301 runs at 33.44. In 61 Tests, he had scored 5,410 runs at an average of 56.94. He retired as the leading run-scorer in Test matches, a record he held until it was passed by Wally Hammond in 1937. Maintaining his form for the rest of the season, Hobbs scored 2,103 first-class runs in 1930 at 51.29.

===End of career===
During the winter of 1930–31, Hobbs and Sutcliffe joined a private team run by the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram which toured India and Ceylon. Hobbs was very popular with the crowds, and scored 593 runs. These runs, and in particular the two centuries he scored, were to prove controversial. Hobbs never believed that the matches were, or should have been, of first-class status, but statisticians later judged them to be first-class. &quot;Wisden&quot; never recognised the centuries and so records his century total as 197. Other authorities give 199 centuries. Despite using a more limited batting technique, Hobbs remained successful in 1931. He played several representative matches and took part in the 150th century opening partnership of his career. In total, he scored 2,418 first-class runs in the season at 56.23. In 1932, despite missing several matches owing to injuries and fatigue, he scored 1,764 runs at 56.90, including centuries in each innings against Essex. According to Mason, this latter performance prompted Douglas Jardine to coin the nickname &quot;The Master&quot; for Hobbs. Hobbs scored 161 not out for the Players against the Gentlemen, his 16th century in the fixture, to pass the record total of WG Grace for the Gentlemen.

Hobbs was partially involved in the Bodyline controversy in Australia in 1932–33. Late in the 1932 season, Bill Bowes consistently bowled short-pitched deliveries against him in a match between Surrey and Yorkshire. Bowes was criticised in the press and particularly by Pelham Warner, who was to manage the MCC team in Australia. Hobbs accompanied the team to Australia as a journalist, writing for the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The Star&quot;, accompanied by his ghostwriter Jack Ingham. During the tour, Hobbs neither condemned Bodyline nor fully described the English tactics. Other journalists admired Hobbs but dismissed his writing as &quot;bland&quot;. When he returned to England, Hobbs openly criticised the English tactics in newspaper columns and in a book he wrote about the tour. In 1933, playing less frequently, he scored 1,105 runs at 61.38, aged 50. After missing the first games with illness, he scored 221 against the touring West Indian team, to the acclaim of the press. He did not play every game, and the Surrey committee allowed him to choose which matches to play. More centuries followed later that season, which took him to 196 in his career, fuelling anticipation that he would reach 200 centuries. That winter he accompanied the MCC team in India as a journalist. Before the next season, Surrey constructed a new entrance to the Oval which was named after Hobbs. In 1934, he scored 624 runs at 36.70. After a solid start, he scored his final first-class century against Lancashire. After this he played irregularly, and his batting began to appear uncomfortable. Hobbs realised his career was over: in February 1935, he announced his retirement. There were many tributes and a public dinner was held in his honour which was attended by many leading figures in cricket. In all first-class cricket, Hobbs scored 61,760 runs at an average of 50.70 according to ESPNcricinfo. Later in 1935, Hobbs was made an honorary life member of Surrey.

==Style and technique==

For much of Hobbs&#x27; career, critics judged him to be the best batsman in the world. E. W. Swanton described him in 1963 as &quot;a supreme master of his craft, and the undisputed head of his profession&quot;. Neville Cardus said that Hobbs was the first batsman to develop a technique to succeed consistently against googly bowlers, and that he mastered all types of bowling, all over the world and in a variety of conditions. Other critics have suggested that Hobbs moved the focus of batting from aesthetic off side shots to leg side play more suited to swing and googly bowling. Swanton wrote that Hobbs combined classical play with effective defence—including protecting the wickets using his pads—against the ball unexpectedly moving towards the stumps. His pad-play was controversial: it removed any possibility of dismissal but was regarded by some cricket authorities as negative and unsporting.

Many of his English contemporaries rated Hobbs superior to Donald Bradman, often regarded as the greatest batsman in the history of cricket, on difficult pitches. In difficult batting conditions Hobbs batted with great success, and several of his most highly regarded innings came in such circumstances. Murphy suggests: &quot;Before Bradman, he was the most consistent run-getter of all time, yet no one worried less about the sheer slog of carving out big scores.&quot; Hobbs frequently was out deliberately soon after reaching a century—roughly a quarter of his centuries were scores less than 110—and was not particularly interested in most statistics. An article in &quot;Wisden&quot; in 2000 stated: &quot;He was never as dominant as Bradman; he never wanted to be. But his contemporaries were in awe of his ability to play supremely and at whim, whatever the conditions.&quot;
Hobbs&#x27; technique was based on strong forearms and good foot movement. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow suggested that &quot;his footwork was, as near as is humanly possible, perfect. In every stroke, he moved into line with the ball with so little effort that he could bat for hours without over-taxing energy of mind or body.&quot; He played every type of shot—he did not have a &quot;signature&quot; shot like other batsmen, but selected his strokes effectively; according to Alec Kennedy, who bowled to Hobbs, it seemed that he could predict what the bowler would do. In contrast to many leading batsmen from his time, Hobbs preferred to play off the back foot as he believed it gave him more time to see the ball and adapt his shot. Capable of playing all the strokes, he hit the ball precisely between fielders and sometimes delayed his shot to make the ball travel more slowly and allow more time to run; he also ran well between the wickets. He liked to score his first run quickly when he came into bat, and he often looked to score quickly at the start of an innings, before the bowlers had settled; on occasion, Hobbs targeted the main bowling threats from the opposition in an attempt to neutralise them. Early in his career, mainly before the First World War, Hobbs was an aggressive, fast-scoring batsman who played many shots. After the war, he was more circumspect and adapted his technique to account for both his increased age, and the increased pressure and expectation from the public and teammates. He concentrated to a greater extent on batting for longer periods; many critics, including Hobbs himself, recognised the change and suggested that he was a better batsman before 1914. However, commentators also noted that he displayed greater certainty and control in this later period; Cardus wrote that &quot;he scored his centuries effortlessly now; we hardly noted the making of them.&quot; This was the period in which he became known as &quot;The Master&quot;, and he was more consistent than before the war. This was the time when the public regarded him with the most respect and affection; 98 of his centuries and 26,411 of his runs (at an average of 58.62) in first-class cricket were scored after he reached the age of 40.

Hobbs was an occasional medium-paced bowler who bowled a good length and made the ball swing. Some critics judged him to be a potentially good bowler, but both Surrey and England were reluctant for him to bowl regularly, fearing it would affect his batting. As a fielder, Hobbs improved greatly from his early days. He fielded in the covers and was expert in cutting off potential runs and returning the ball quickly to the wicket-keeper. Contemporaries believed him to be one of the best cover fielders there had been, and remarked on his powers of anticipation in getting to the ball. They also noted he sometimes deceived batsmen with his casual attitude and occasional deliberate mis-fields; these would be followed by very sharp fielding which often produced a run out.

Although a professional—captains at the time were almost exclusively amateurs—the respect in which Hobbs was held meant that he was accepted as a captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him a competent tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender, but he was a reluctant captain. He disliked the responsibility and decision-making of leadership, and rarely even offered tactical advice.

==Reputation and legacy==
Hobbs was twice selected as &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; Cricketer of the Year, in 1909 and 1926; only he and Pelham Warner have received this award twice. In 1963, Neville Cardus chose him as one of the best six cricketers of the previous 100 years, to mark &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; centenary. More recently, Hobbs was selected by a panel of experts in 2000 as one of five &quot;Wisden&quot; cricketers of the 20th century. In 2009, he was selected by cricket historians and writers as a member of England&#x27;s all-time best team, and included in a similar team to represent the best players worldwide in the history of cricket. Hobbs&#x27; Test batting average of 56.94 remained as of 2016 the sixth best among batsmen to have passed 5,000 runs, despite a rise in the number of batsmen who average more than 50 since 2000. Among openers who have scored 5,000 Test runs, he has the third best average behind Sutcliffe and Len Hutton. He was comfortably the leading Test run-scorer during his career, and had the highest number of Test runs at the time of his retirement. Between 1910 and 1929, he averaged 65.55 in Test cricket.

Gideon Haigh suggests that Hobbs was a &quot;spontaneous and original&quot;, trend-setting batsman who was not afraid to depart from orthodoxy. Gerald Howat notes that, aside from his batting achievements, &quot;Hobbs&#x27;s biographers and obituarists could strike no discordant note. He was a man of moral probity, religious conviction, and personal commitment. And he was humble enough to see himself as an ordinary person blessed with one extraordinary talent, which he put into its proper perspective. It was an attitude of mind which tempered the sternness of his approach with an engaging humour and a delight in playing practical jokes.&quot; Among his contemporaries, Hobbs was regarded as modest and kind, and never criticised other players. He avoided confrontation, although he was &quot;quietly determined&quot;, according to &quot;Wisden&quot;, and tried to avoid publicity. According to Fender, Hobbs &quot;gave stature&quot; to the profession of cricket. Modern critics have expressed some reservations: some have pointed out that his batting average, although high, has been surpassed by others, and that among his many centuries, few were as large as other players managed. However, others contend that his impact on the game, his achievement in showing that professionals could bat as freely and stylishly as amateurs, and his kindness place him among the top cricketers of all time. &quot;Wisden&quot; described him in 2000: &quot;More than anyone else, he lifted the status and dignity of the English professional cricketer.&quot; In summing up his place in history, it said: &quot;He was not an artist, like some of his predecessors, nor yet a scientist, like some of the moderns; he was perhaps the supreme craftsman.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Family life===
In 1900, Hobbs met Ada Ellen Gates, a cobbler&#x27;s daughter, at an evening church service held in St Matthew&#x27;s, Cambridge. The progress of their relationship was slowed by Hobbs&#x27; shyness and devotion to cricket, but the pair eventually married on 26 September 1906 at the church in which they met. They planned to keep the event quiet, but it was reported in the press and the couple received gifts and messages from Hobbs&#x27; Surrey team-mates. Hobbs so disliked being separated from his wife during cricket tours that in later years she often accompanied the team overseas. They had four children: Jack, born in 1907, Leonard in 1909, Vera in 1913 and Ivor in 1914.

Hobbs and his wife lived in rented property for the first years of their marriage. His earnings placed them roughly in the bracket of lower middle class according to McKinstry: although more prosperous than he had been during his childhood, the family were not initially financially comfortable. Hobbs&#x27; wages increased with his reputation so that by 1913, he was earning £375 (£46,040 in 2021 terms) each year, placing his family within the bracket of the London middle class. After several years of moving from one property to another, he was able to buy his own house in 1913, in Clapham Common, a prosperous area of London. By the middle of the 1920s, cricket in England was extremely popular and the players were famous. Hobbs was the biggest attraction to the sport, and a combination of his cricket earnings (estimated to be around £780 [£50,457 in 2021 terms] each year), the income from his business, product endorsement—he was one of the first cricketers to benefit from lending his name to commercial products—and ghostwritten books and articles made him relatively wealthy. According to McKinstry, his annual earnings probably reached £1,500 (£97,032 in 2021 terms) a year by 1925, more than a family doctor at the time. Consequently, in 1928, the family moved to a large house in private grounds, and Hobbs was able to send his children to private schools. He had greater financial independence than most contemporary cricketers, but he was always first concerned to give his family the security lacking from his childhood.

===Health===
Hobbs was teetotal.

===Retirement and final years===
Following his retirement from cricket in 1934, Hobbs continued to work as a journalist, first with Jack Ingham then with Jimmy Bolton as his ghostwriters. He accompanied the MCC team to Australia in 1936–37 and published four books which sold well in the 1930s. In addition, he produced two ghostwritten autobiographies, but generally avoided self-publicity or controversy. He continued to work at his sports shop and he and Ada moved home several times. By the mid-1930s, his wife was becoming mentally and physically frail. Hobbs supported several charities in his spare time and continued to play cricket at club and charity level.

During the Second World War, Hobbs served in the Home Guard at New Malden. In 1946, Hobbs became the first professional to be elected to the Surrey committee. The same year, he and his wife moved to Hove, following several years of health concerns and worries over his business and children. Ada&#x27;s health continued to deteriorate, and the couple spent some time in South Africa in an attempt to aid her recuperation.

Hobbs was knighted for services to cricket in the 1953 Coronation Honours, the first professional cricketer to be so honoured; he was reluctant to accept it and only did so when convinced that it was an honour to all professional cricketers, not just himself. In the same year, John Arlott formed the &quot;Master&#x27;s Club&quot;, a group of Hobbs&#x27; admirers who met regularly to celebrate him. Hobbs remained active into the 1960s, including working in his shop. By the late 1950s, Ada required the use of a wheelchair, and Hobbs spent most of his time caring for her. She died in March 1963. Hobbs&#x27; own health began to fail shortly afterwards, and he died on 21 December 1963 at the age of 81. He left £19,445 (£433,263 in 2021 terms) in his will and was buried in Hove Cemetery. A memorial service was held at Southwark Cathedral in February 1964.

<text>Neem Karoli Baba () or Neeb Karori Baba () ( – 11 September 1973), also known to his followers as &#x27;Maharaj-ji&#x27;, was a Hindu guru and a devotee of the Hindu deity Hanuman. He is known outside India for being the spiritual master of a number of Americans who travelled to India in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Biography ==
===Early years===
Lakshman Narayan Sharma was born around 1900 in the village Akbarpur in Firozabad district of Uttar Pradesh, India, to a wealthy Brahmin family. After being married by his parents at the age of 11, he left home to become a wandering sadhu. He later returned home, at his father&#x27;s request, to live a settled married life. He fathered two sons and a daughter.

===As Maharaj-ji===
Neem Karoli Baba, known at the time as Baba Lakshman Das (also spelled &quot;Laxman Das&quot;), left his home in 1958. Ram Dass tells a story that Baba Lakshman Das boarded a train without a ticket and the conductor decided to halt the train and forced him out of the train in Neem Karoli village of Farrukhabad district (U.P). After forcing Baba off the train, the conductor found that the train would not start again. After several attempts at starting the train, someone suggested to the conductor that they allow the sadhu back on to the train. Neem Karoli agreed to board the train on two conditions: 1) the railway company promise to build a station in the village of Neem Karoli (at the time the villagers had to walk many miles to the nearest station), and 2) the railway company must henceforth treat ascetics better. The officials agreed and Neem Karoli Baba boarded the train joking, &quot;What, is it up to me to start trains?&quot; Immediately after his boarding the train, it started, but the train drivers would not proceed unless the sadhu blessed them to move forward. Baba gave his blessings and the train proceeded. Later a train station was built in the village. However, there is no factual evidence of this story being true. Baba lived in the village for a while and was named by locals.

Thereafter he wandered extensively throughout Northern India. During this time he was known under many names, including: Lakshman Das, Handi Wallah Baba, and Tikonia Walla Baba. When he did tapasya and sadhana at Vavania village of Morbi in Gujarat, he was known as Tallaiya Baba. In Vrindavan, local inhabitants addressed him by the name of Chamatkari Baba (&quot;miracle baba&quot;). During his life two main ashrams were built, at Kainchi and at Vrindavan. In time, over 100 temples were constructed in his name.

The Kainchi Dham ashram, where he stayed in the last decade of his life, was built in 1964 with a Hanuman temple. It started two years prior with a modest platform built for two local sadhus, Premi Baba and Sombari Maharaj to perform yagnas. Over the years the temple, situated 17 km from Nainital on the Nainital-Almora road, has become an important pilgrimage for locals, as well as spiritual seekers and devotees worldwide. Each year on June 15, the Kainchi Dham Bhandara takes place to commemorate the inauguration of the temple, a celebration that typically receives over 100,000 devotees.

===Death===

Neem Karoli Baba died at approximately 1:15 a.m. on 11 September 1973 in a hospital at Vrindavan, India, after slipping into a diabetic coma. He had been returning by night train to Kainchi near Nainital, from Agra where he had visited a heart specialist due to experiencing pains in his chest. He and his traveling companions had disembarked at Mathura railway station where he began convulsing and requested being taken to Shri Dham Vrindavan.

His samadhi was built within the complex of the Vrindavan ashram, which also has some of his personal belongings.

==Philosophy==
Neem Karoli Baba was a lifelong adept of bhakti yoga, and encouraged service to others (seva) as the highest form of unconditional devotion to God. In the book &quot;Miracle of Love&quot;, compiled by Ram Dass, a devotee named Anjani shares the following account:

Baba would say that attachment and ego are the greatest hindrances to the realisation of God and that &quot;a learned man and a fool are alike as long as there is attachment and ego in the physical body.&quot; He would advise people to surrender to God&#x27;s will above everything else so that they might develop love and faith in him and thereby be free of unnecessary worries in life.

==List of Neem Karoli Baba’s Ashrams and Temples==
== Sri Siddhi Ma == 
Siddhi Ma is a prominent figure in the spiritual lineage of Baba Neem Karoli Maharaj, renowned for her unwavering devotion and significant contributions to the community. Born in Almora, she grew up in a family with eight sisters. Siddhi Maa married Tularam Sah, a dedicated devotee of Baba Neem Karoli. Following her husband’s death, she made a profound commitment to serve Baba, ultimately sacrificing her family life to devote herself fully to spiritual pursuits.

When Baba Neem Karoli Maharaj attained Brahmaline status in 1973, Siddhi Ma was chosen as his successor, taking over the management of the Kainchi Dham temple complex. This responsibility placed her in a pivotal role within the spiritual community. Devotees regarded her with immense respect, often equating her spiritual stature to that of Baba. It is said that before becoming Brahmaline, Baba wrote a line for her, affirming her significance: &quot;Mother, wherever you live, there will be Mangal.&quot;

Siddhi Ma regularly held darshan sessions for devotees at Kainchi Dham, typically on Saturday and Tuesday. Her presence was considered a blessing, and many devotees believed that she had inherited Baba’s supernatural powers. She was known for her compassionate nature, and her ability to alleviate the suffering of those who came to seek her blessings was widely acknowledged. She often led pilgrimages, fostering a sense of unity and community among her followers.

In 1980, Siddhi Ma established an ashram in Rishikesh, further expanding the spiritual outreach of Baba Neem Karoli Maharaj, who is associated with 108 ashrams globally. The Kainchi Dham and Taos Ashram in New Mexico, USA, are among the most significant. After her passing on December 28, 2017, at the age of 92, a grand statue of Siddhi Maa was installed at Kainchi Dham, alongside the construction of a dedicated pooja room. This serves as a focal point for devotees wishing to honor her memory. An annual bhandara is organized every year on her death anniversary, drawing countless devotees to celebrate her legacy.

Siddhi Ma’s influence extends beyond her lifetime, with stories of her grace and spiritual power continuing to inspire new generations. Her life remains a testament to devotion, compassion, and spiritual fulfillment, solidifying her place in the annals of spiritual history.

Although Baba Hari Dass was not a disciple, he supervised ashram buildings in the Nainital area before moving to the U.S. to teach.

In April 1974, Steve Jobs and his friend Dan Kottke traveled to India to explore Hinduism and Indian spirituality, intending to meet Neem Karoli Baba. However, they arrived to find that the guru had passed away the previous September. Hollywood actress Julia Roberts was also inspired by Neem Karoli Baba; a picture of him led her to Hinduism. Influenced by Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg later visited the ashram in Kainchi. Larry Brilliant took Google&#x27;s Larry Page and eBay co-founder Jeffrey Skoll on a pilgrimage to the same ashram

==Foundations==

After returning to the United States, Ram Dass and Larry Brilliant founded the Seva Foundation, an international health organization based in Berkeley, California. Steve Jobs, a friend of Brilliant, also funded the organization. It is committed to applying the teachings of Neem Karoli Baba toward preventing and treating blindness.

In the late 2000s another Foundation evolved, the &#x27;Love Serve Remember Foundation&#x27;, whose purpose is to preserve and continue the teachings of Neem Karoli Baba.

In 2024, Indian humanitarian and spiritual worker Rahul Verma, a devoted follower of Neem Karoli Baba, founded the NKB Divine Meditation Foundation, offering free guided meditation sessions based on the teachings of Neem Karoli Baba to help individuals connect with their inner peace and holistic well-being.

== Documentary ==
The 2021 documentary &quot;Windfall of Grace&quot; offers an engaging blend of narratives from simple, rustic Indian devotees juxtaposed with narratives of renowned American devotees. These expressions seek to bring out not just the contrasts but also the similarities between the two by way of their overwhelming love and surrender for Neem Karoli Baba. Their individual encounters with Baba sparked dramatic shifts in their life&#x27;s purpose along with their spiritual path and practice.

<doc id="302767" wikidata="Q713540" url="?curid=302767" title="Comfort women">
<text>Comfort women were women and girls forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces in occupied countries and territories before and during World War II. The term &quot;comfort women&quot; is a translation of the Japanese , a euphemism that literally means &quot;comforting, consoling woman&quot;. During World War II, Japanese troops forced hundreds of thousands of women from Australia, Burma, China, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, East Timor, New Guinea and other countries into sexual enslavement for Japanese soldiers; however, the majority of the women were from Korea. Many women died due to brutal mistreatment and sustained physical and emotional distress. After the war, Japan denied the existence of comfort women, refusing to provide an apology or appropriate restitution. After numerous demands for an apology and the revelation of official records showing the Japanese government&#x27;s culpability, the Japanese government began to offer an official apology and compensation in the 1990s. The two countries eventually signed an agreement to consider the matter “resolved finally and irreversibly” in 2015. 

Estimates vary as to how many women were involved, with most historians settling somewhere in the range of 20,000–200,000; the exact numbers are still being researched and debated.

Originally, the brothels were established to provide soldiers with a sexual outlet, to reduce wartime rape and the spread of venereal diseases. The comfort stations, however, had the reverse effect of what was intended—it increased the amount of rapes and increased the spread of venereal diseases. The first victims were Japanese women, some of whom were recruited by conventional means, and others who were recruited through deception or kidnapping. The military later turned to women in Japanese colonies, due to lack of Japanese volunteers and the need to protect Japan&#x27;s image. In many cases, women were lured by false job openings for nurses and factory workers. Others were also lured by the promises of equity and sponsorship for higher education. A significant percentage of comfort women were minors.

== Outline of the comfort women system ==
=== Establishment by Japanese military ===

Given that prostitution in Japan was pervasive and organized, it was logical to find military prostitution in the Japanese armed forces. Military correspondence within the Imperial Japanese Army shows that the aims for facilitating comfort stations were: to reduce or prevent rape crimes by Japanese army personnel in an effort to prevent a worsening of anti-Japanese sentiment, to reduce venereal diseases among Japanese troops, and to prevent leakage of military secrets by civilians who were in contact with Japanese officers. Carmen Argibay, a former member of the Argentine Supreme Court of Justice, states that the Japanese government aimed to prevent atrocities like the Rape of Nanking by confining rape and sexual abuse to military-controlled facilities, or stop incidents from leaking to the international press should they occur. She also states that the government wanted to minimize medical expenses on treating venereal diseases that the soldiers acquired from frequent and widespread rape, which hindered Japan&#x27;s military capacity. Comfort women lived in sordid conditions, and were called &quot;public toilets&quot; by the Japanese. Yuki Tanaka states that local brothels outside of the military&#x27;s reach had issues of security, since there were possibilities of spies disguised as workers of such private facilities. Japanese historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi further states that the Japanese military used comfort women to satisfy disgruntled soldiers during World War II and prevent military revolt. He said that, despite the goal of reducing rape and venereal disease, the comfort stations did the opposite—aggravating rape and increasing the spread of venereal disease. Comfort women stations were so prevalent that the Imperial Army offered accountancy classes on how to manage comfort stations, which included how to determine the actuarial &quot;durability or perishability of the women procured.&quot;

==== Outline ====
In the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, Japan&#x27;s military closely regulated privately operated brothels in Manchuria.

Comfort houses were first established in Shanghai after the Shanghai incident in 1932 as a response to wholesale rape of Chinese women by Japanese soldiers. Yasuji Okamura, the chief of staff in Shanghai, ordered the construction of comfort houses to prevent further rape. After the rapes of many Chinese women by Japanese troops during the Nanjing Massacre in 1937, the Japanese forces adopted the general policy of creating comfort stations in various places in Japanese occupied Chinese territory, &quot;not because of their concern for the Chinese victims of rape by Japanese soldiers but because of their fear of creating antagonism among the Chinese civilians.&quot; To staff the establishments, Japanese prostitutes were imported from Japan. Japanese women were the first victims to be enslaved in military brothels and trafficked across Japan, Okinawa, Japan&#x27;s colonies and occupied territories, and overseas battlegrounds. According to Yoshiaki Yoshimi, comfort stations were established to avoid criticism from China, the United States of America and Europe following the case of massive rapes between battles in Shanghai and Nanjing.

As Japan continued military expansion, the military found itself short of Japanese volunteers, and turned to local populations—abducting and coercing women into serving as sex slaves in the comfort stations. Many women responded to calls to work as factory workers or nurses, and did not know that they were being pressed into sexual slavery.

In the early stages of World War II, Japanese authorities recruited prostitutes through conventional means. In urban areas, conventional advertising through middlemen was used alongside kidnapping. Middlemen advertised in newspapers circulating in Japan and in the Japanese colonies of Korea, Taiwan, Manchukuo, and China. These sources soon dried up, especially in metropolitan Japan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs resisted further issuance of travel visas for Japanese prostitutes, feeling it tarnished the image of the Japanese Empire. The military turned to acquiring comfort women outside mainland Japan, mostly from Korea and from occupied China. An existing system of licensed prostitution within Korea made it easy for Japan to recruit women in large numbers.

Many women were tricked or defrauded into joining the military brothels. Based on false characterizations and payments—by Japanese or by local recruitment agents—which could help relieve family debts, many Korean girls enlisted to take the job. Furthermore, the South East Asia Translation and Interrogation Center (SEATIC) Psychological Warfare Interrogation Bulletin No.2 states that a Japanese facility-manager purchased Korean women for 300 to 1000 yen depending on their physical characteristics, who then became his property and were not released even after completing the servitude terms specified in the contract. In northern Hebei province of China, Hui Muslim girls were recruited to &quot;Huimin Girls&#x27; school&quot; to be trained as entertainers, but then forced to serve as sex slaves. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that a major issue was that no historian had examined whether the soldiers of the Indian National Army used comfort women, since there had been no investigation for it. Lebra wrote &quot;None of those who have written on Bose&#x27;s Indian national army has investigated whether, while they were trained by the Japanese army, they were permitted to share in the &#x27;comfort&#x27; provided by thousands of kidnapped Korean young women held as sex slaves by the Imperial Japanese Army at its camps. This might have provided them with some insight into the nature of Japanese, as opposed to British, colonial rule, as well what might be in store for their sisters and daughters.&quot;

Under the strain of the war effort, the military became unable to provide enough supplies to Japanese units; in response, the units made up the difference by demanding or looting supplies from the locals. The military often directly demanded that local leaders procure women for the brothels along the front lines, especially in the countryside where middlemen were rare. When the locals were considered hostile in China, Japanese soldiers carried out the &quot;Three Alls policy&quot; (&quot;kill all, burn all, loot all&quot;) which included indiscriminately kidnapping and raping local civilians.

==== Later archives ====
On April 17, 2007, Yoshiaki Yoshimi and Hirofumi Hayashi announced the discovery of seven official documents in the archives of the Tokyo Trials, suggesting that Imperial military forces – such as the &quot;Tokkeitai&quot; (Naval military police) – forced women whose fathers attacked the &quot;Kenpeitai&quot; (Japanese Army military police) to work in front-line brothels in China, Indochina, and Indonesia. These documents were initially made public at the war crimes trial. In one of these, a lieutenant is quoted as confessing to having organized a brothel and having used it himself. Another source refers to &quot;Tokkeitai&quot; members having arrested women on the streets and putting them in brothels after enforced medical examinations.

On May 12, 2007, journalist Taichiro Kajimura announced the discovery of 30 Dutch government documents submitted to the Tokyo tribunal as evidence of a forced mass prostitution incident in 1944 in Magelang.

The South Korean government designated Bae Jeong-ja as a pro-Japanese collaborator (&quot;chinilpa&quot;) in September 2007 for recruiting comfort women.

In 2014, China produced almost 90 documents from the archives of the Kwantung Army on the issue. According to China, the documents provide ironclad proof that the Japanese military forced Asian women to work in front-line brothels before and during World War II.

In June 2014, more official documents were made public from the government of Japan&#x27;s archives, documenting sexual violence and women forced into sexual slavery, committed by Imperial Japanese soldiers in French Indochina and Indonesia.

A 2015 study examined archival data which was previously difficult to access, partly due to the China-Japan Joint Communiqué of 1972 in which the Chinese government agreed not to seek any restitution for wartime crimes and incidents. New documents discovered in China shed light on facilities inside comfort stations operated within a Japanese army compound, and the conditions of the Korean comfort women. Documents were discovered verifying the Japanese Army as the funding agency for purchasing some comfort women.

Su Zhiliang, a professor at Shanghai Normal University, examined the Japanese Kwantung Army&#x27;s records in Manchuria (now Northeast China), which are housed at the Jilin Archives in China. The operations of the Japanese Military Police, who were in charge of overseeing the &quot;comfort stations&quot; in various parts of China and Java, were the subject of these records. Su concluded that the sources revealed that comfort women stations were ordered, supported, and managed by the Japanese military authorities.

Documents were found in Shanghai that showed details of how the Japanese Army went about opening comfort stations for Japanese troops in occupied Shanghai. Documents included the Tianjin Municipal Archives from the archival files of the Japanese government and the Japanese police during the periods of the occupation in World War II. Municipal archives from Shanghai and Nanjing were also examined. One conclusion reached was that the relevant archives in Korea are distorted. A conclusion of the study was that the Japanese Imperial government and the colonial government in Korea tried to avoid recording the illegal mobilization of comfort women. It was concluded that they burned most of the records immediately before the surrender; however, the study confirmed that some documents and records survived.

=== Number of comfort women ===
Professor Su Jiliang concludes that during the seven-year period from 1938 to 1945, comfort women in the territory occupied by the Japanese numbered 360,000 to 410,000, among whom the Chinese were the largest group, about 200,000.
Lack of official documentation has made estimating the total number of comfort women difficult. Vast amounts of material pertaining to war crimes, and the responsibility of the nation&#x27;s highest leaders, were either destroyed or concealed on the orders of the Japanese government at the end of the war. Historians have arrived at various estimates by looking at surviving documentation, which indicates the ratio of soldiers in a particular area to the number of women and replacement rates of the women.

Most academic researchers and media typically point to Yoshiaki&#x27;s estimate as the most probable range of the numbers of women involved. This figure contrasts with the inscriptions on monuments in the United States such as those in New Jersey, New York, Virginia, and California, which state the number of comfort women as &quot;more than 200,000&quot;.

The BBC quotes &quot;200,000 to 300,000&quot;, and the International Commission of Jurists quotes &quot;estimates of historians of 100,000 to 200,000 women.&quot;

=== Countries of origin ===
Most of the women were from occupied countries, including Korea, China, and the Philippines. Women who were used for military &quot;comfort stations&quot; also came from Burma, Thailand, French Indochina, Malaya, Manchukuo, Taiwan (then a Japanese dependency), the Dutch East Indies, Portuguese Timor, Papua New Guinea (including some mixed race Japanese-Papuans) and other Japanese-occupied territories. Stations were located in Japan, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaya, Thailand, Burma, New Guinea, Hong Kong, Macau, and French Indochina. A smaller number of women of European origin were also involved, mostly from the Netherlands and Australia with an estimated 200–400 Dutch women alone, with an unknown number of other European women.

According to State University of New York at Buffalo professor Yoshiko Nozaki and other sources, the majority of the women were from Korea and China. Chuo University professor and historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi discovered an abundance of documentation and testimony proving the existence of 2,000 comfort women stations where approximately 200,000 Korean, Filipina, Taiwanese, Indonesian, Burmese, Dutch, Australian, and Japanese women, many of whom were teenagers, were confined and forced to perform sexual activities with Japanese troops. According to Qiu Peipei of Vassar College, comfort women were replaced with other women at a rapid rate, making her estimates of 200,000-400,000 comfort women plausible, with the majority being Chinese women. Ikuhiko Hata, a professor of Nihon University, estimated the number of women working in the licensed pleasure quarter was fewer than 20,000 and that they were 40% Japanese, 20% Koreans, 10% Chinese, with others making up the remaining 30%. According to Hata, the total number of government-regulated prostitutes in Japan was only 170,000 during World War II. Others came from the Philippines, Taiwan, the Dutch East Indies, and other Japanese-occupied countries and regions. Some Dutch women, captured in Dutch colonies in Asia, were also forced into sexual slavery.

In further analysis of the Imperial Army medical records for venereal disease treatment from 1940, Yoshimi concluded that if the percentages of women treated reflected the general makeup of the total comfort women population, Korean women made up 51.8 percent, Chinese 36 percent and Japanese 12.2 percent.

In 1997, Bruce Cumings, a historian of Korea, wrote that Japan had forced quotas to supply the comfort women program and that Korean men helped recruit the victims. Cumings stated that between 100,000 and 200,000 Korean girls and women were recruited. In Korea, the daughters of the gentry and the bureaucracy were spared from being sent into the &quot;comfort women corps&quot; unless they or their families showed signs of pro-independence tendencies, and the overwhelming majority of the Korean girls taken into the &quot;comfort women corps&quot; came from the poor. The Army and Navy often subcontracted the work of taking girls into the &quot;comfort women corps&quot; in Korea to contractors, who were usually associated in some way with organized crime groups that were paid for girls they presented. Though a substantial minority of the contractors in Korea were Japanese, the majority were Korean.

In the Philippines during the Japanese occupation, around 1,000 Filipino women were made into comfort women. The victims were as young as 12 years old at the time of their enslavement. As many of the survivors recall, the garrisons or comfort stations/brothels were spread all over the Philippines. The garrisons were located from the northern region of Cagayan Valley to the Davao region in the south.

During the initial invasion of Dutch East Indies, Japanese soldiers raped many Indonesian and European women and girls. The Kenpeitai established the comfort women program to control the problem. The Kenpeitai forced and coerced many interned women to serve as prostitutes, including several hundred European women. A few of these chose to live in the homes of Japanese officers to serve one man as a sex slave rather than many men in a brothel. One such European woman, K&#x27;tut Tantri, of Scottish ancestry, wrote a book describing her ordeal. A Dutch government study described the methods used by the Japanese military to seize the women by force. It concluded that among the 200 to 300 European women found in the Japanese military brothels, &quot;some sixty five were most certainly forced into prostitution&quot;. Others, faced with starvation in the refugee camps, agreed to offers of food and payment for work, the nature of which was not completely revealed to them. Some of the women also volunteered in hopes of protecting the younger ones. The number of women forced into prostitution may therefore be much higher than the Dutch record indicated. The number of Dutch women that were sexually assaulted or molested was also largely ignored. It was not until individuals and groups such as the Foundation of Japanese Honorary Debts began advocating for victims of the Japanese occupation that the plight of Dutch comfort women entered the collective conscience. As well as being raped and sexually assaulted every day and night, the Dutch girls lived in constant fear of beatings and other physical violence.

J.F. van Wagtendonk and the Dutch Broadcast Foundation estimated a total number of 400 Dutch girls were taken from the camps to become comfort women.

Besides Dutch women, many Javanese were also recruited from Indonesia as comfort women, including around 1000 East Timorese women and girls who also used as sexual slaves. Most were adolescent girls aged 14–19 who had completed some education and were deceived through promises of higher education in Tokyo or Singapore. Common destinations of comfort women from Java included Burma, Thailand, and Eastern Indonesia. Interviews conducted with former comfort women also suggest that some women came from the island of Flores. After the war, many Javanese comfort women who survived stayed in the locations where they had been trafficked to and became integrated into local populations.

Melanesian women from New Guinea were also used as comfort women. Local women were recruited from Rabaul as comfort women, along with some number of mixed Japanese-Papuan women born to Japanese fathers and Papuan mothers. One Australian Captain, David Hutchinson-Smith, also mentioned mixed-race, young Japanese-Papuan girls conscripted as comfort women. A Papuan activist from Western New Guinea claimed an estimated 16,161 Papuan New Guinean comfort women were used by Japanese male soldiers during their occupation of New Guinea.

In 1985, Japanese comfort woman survivor Shirota Suzuko (1921–1993) released her autobiography, detailing the sufferings she and other women endured as comfort women.

More than 2,000 Taiwanese women were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military; as of 2020, only two were still believed to be alive. Yoshiaki Yoshimi notes that more than half of Taiwanese comfort women were minors. In 2023 the last surviving Taiwanese comfort woman died.

The Japanese academic Nakahara Michiko from Waseda University wrote a paper on comfort women in Malaysia who were forced to serve the Japanese military. She wrote that the Japanese targeted their comfort women recruitment form all ethnic groups and not just one in the occupied regions. The Malay Mustapha Yaakub, who was Youth International Bureau secretary for the UMNO called for Malaaysians who were victimized by Japanese soldiers such as comfort women to go out in public and talk about what happened in 1993. He received multiple letters including one known by the pseydonym P who was interviewed by Nakahara. However, Najib Tun Razak, the head of UMNOF Youth and Defence Minister banned Mustapha Yaakub from talking about the Malay rape victims at the 1993 Austria United Nations Human Rights Conference. Nakahara wrote about an ethnic Malay comfort woman who was raped and forced into sex slavery at a comfort woman station by Japanese soldiers. The Malay rape victim said &quot;&quot;I worked like an animal, they did to me just as they liked. I had to obey their orders until the surrender&quot;. Nakahara said &quot;Her daughter told me her mother has nightmares and cries in her sleep. She used to wander aimlessly after the bad dreams ... She told me herself that she begged God for pardon for the sins she had committed. She still suffers from her memory and her feeling of having sinned. It seems nobody in her village ever told her that it was not her sin at all ... She had asked her daughter to write a letter for her. However, her long suffering was left unremedied&quot;. The Malay woman thought that the UMNO party would demand the Japanese government apologize and pay reparations since she was a member of the UMNO but the UMNOF leadership refused to press the case.

The Japanese forced ethnic Malay Muslim girls into becoming comfort women to be raped by Japanese soldiers. One of these Malay girls had her experience made into a historical play drama called &quot;Hayatie&#x27;s life (Hayat Hayatie) when she was raped by the Japanese in Singapore. Another play called Wild Rice was also based on another Malay comfort woman who didn&#x27;t tell her family in the 1980s how she was raped by the Japanese in the 1940s and sought to hide her humiliation from them.

On 16–17 October 1992, in Nepal, Kathmandu, the &quot;Conference of International  Investigation Committee on the Crimes of War of Japan&quot; took place with members attending from Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Japan, Algeria and France. The UMNO (United Malays National Organization) Youth secretary Musapha Yakuub was a Malay delegate at the meeting and comfort women were one of the topics there. Mustapha then started his own investigation and documentation of all Japanese crimes committed from 1942 to 1945 when they occupied Malaysia against its people. Mustapha urged all victims to report to him the atrocities that the Japanese had done in Malaysia and wanted to force the Japanese government to pay reparations and apologize by bringing up comfort women and forced labor which he called &quot;Cruel deeds&quot; at the UN Human Rights Commission. Mustapha wanted to attend the May 1993 Austria, Vienna UN World Human Rights Conference and submit his report so that countries attacked by Japan could testify to the commission for the reparations and apologies. 3,500 Malaysians sent letters to Mustapha Yaakub in the span of 4 months. The victims thought the UMNO Malaysian government was going to demand reparations and an apology from Japan so they had turned up en masse since a UMNO official was behind the push. Their hopes were dashed when the UMNO heads led by Najiz Razak forced Mustapha Yaakub to back down so Japan did not apologize or pay reparations to Malay rape vicitms.
Indigenous Indonesian Muslim Javanese girls and women were taken as comfort women by Japanese soldiers and raped. One Indonesian seaman named Sukarno Martodiharjo (unrelated to the Indonesian President Sukarno) witnessed Indonesian Muslim Javanese girls trafficked as comfort women by Japanese soldiers. Indonesian writer Pramudya Ananta Tur wrote about how Javanese Muslim Indonesian girls were taken as sex slaves by the Japanese and the fact that they were from high class prominent families and their fathers were tricked into sending them into prostitution since the Japanese lied to them and told them their daughters would study in Japan. Javanese collaborators included public servants, school headmasters, policemen, village heads, subdistrict heads and other local chiefs. A Javanese Indonesian Muslim girl, Siti Fatimah recalled being raped as a comfort women by the Japanese after she was tricked into becoming a comfort woman. She was lied to and told she was being taken to Tokyo to study there and instead sent to a Japanese military brothel in Flores to be raped. Over 20,000 Indonesian women reported they were raped by Japanese soldiers since 1993 after the Indonesian government asked Indonesian women to report if they were victims of Japanese rape. Each Javanese Indonesian comfort woman trafficked to a station in Flores was raped by 23 Japanese men daily, 1 officer, 2 NCOS and 20 soldiers. They were expected to be raped by 100 men each week and received a ticket showing it from every one of them. The mass rapes committed by the Japanese against indigenous Javanese Indonesian Muslim women largely went unpunished since the Allied powers like the Dutch and Australians showed no interest in investigation or pressing charges against the Japanese for raping Indonesian women. The Dutch had sexually abused and raped indigenous Javanese Indonesian women for centuries, including using them as military prostitutes for Dutch soldiers; so the Dutch did not view what the Japanese did to Indonesians as a crime, but rather as a norm. The Japanese also destroyed tons of records related to Indonesian comfort women as they were losing the war so the true number of Indonesian comfort women is unknown. Sukarno, the first president of Indonesia, collaborated with the Japanese and recruited Indonesian girls as prostitutes for Japanese soldiers.

=== Treatment of comfort women ===
It is estimated that most of the survivors became infertile because of the multiple rapes or venereal diseases contracted following the rapes.

Women and girls were stripped of their agency and dehumanized as &quot;&#x27;female ammunition&#x27;, &#x27;public toilets&#x27;, or &#x27;military supplies&#x27;&quot;. In order to help injured Japanese soldiers receive treatment, some of them were even forced to donate blood. Even though every victim&#x27;s testimony was unique, they all shared commonalities: they all experienced severe and brutal physical, sexual, and psychological abuse. They were repeatedly beaten and forced to perform sexual service with 10 men on normal days and up to 40 men on days after combat.

Sufficient food, water, proper housing, toilets, and washing facilities were not provided to the women, and the extent of medical care was restricted to treating sexually transmitted diseases, sterilization, and terminating pregnancies. Torture was used against women who attempted to flee or refused to comply with the troops&#x27; demands. In addition, threats were made to the families of girls who attempted suicide.

Since comfort women were forced to travel to the battlefields with the Japanese Imperial Army, many comfort women perished as Allied forces overwhelmed Japan&#x27;s Pacific defense and annihilated Japanese encampments. In certain cases, the Japanese military executed Korean comfort women when they fled from losing battles with the Allied Forces. During the last stand of Japanese forces in 1944–45, comfort women were often forced to commit suicide or were killed. During World war II, at Chuuk Lagoon, 70 comfort women were killed prior to the expected American assault, when the Navy mistook the American air raid as the prelude to an American landing. During the Battle of Saipan comfort women were among those who committed suicide by jumping off cliffs. In Burma, there were cases of Korean comfort women committing suicide by swallowing cyanide pills or being killed by hand grenades tossed into their dug-outs. During the Battle of Manila, when Japanese sailors ran amok and killed civilians indiscriminately, there were cases of comfort women being killed, though this does not seem to have been a systematic policy. The Japanese government had told the Japanese colonists on Saipan that the Americans were cannibals, and so the Japanese population preferred suicide to falling into the hands of the Americans. Many of the Asian comfort women may also have believed this. British soldiers fighting in Burma often reported that the Korean comfort women whom they captured were astonished to learn that the British were not going to eat them. Ironically, given this claim, there were cases of starving Japanese troops cut off on remote Pacific islands or trapped in the jungles of Burma turning towards cannibalism, and there were at least several cases where comfort women in Burma and on Pacific islands were killed to provide food for the Imperial Japanese Army.

According to an account by a survivor, she was beaten when she attempted to resist being raped. The women who were not prostitutes prior to joining the &quot;comfort women corps&quot;, especially those taken in by force, were normally &quot;broken in&quot; by being raped. One Korean woman, Kim Hak-sun, stated in a 1991 interview about how she was drafted into the &quot;comfort women corps&quot; in 1941: &quot;When I was 17 years old, the Japanese soldiers came along in a truck, beat us [her and a friend], and then dragged us into the back. I was told if I were drafted, I could earn lots of money in a textile factory ... The first day I was raped and the rapes never stopped ... I was born a woman but never lived as a woman ... I feel sick when I come close to a man. Not just Japanese men, but all men-even my own husband who saved me from the brothel. I shiver whenever I see a Japanese flag ... Why should I feel ashamed? I don&#x27;t have to feel ashamed.&quot; Kim stated that she was raped 30–40 times a day, every day of the year during her time as a &quot;comfort woman&quot;. Reflecting their dehumanized status, Army and Navy records where referring to the movement of comfort women always used the term &quot;units of war supplies&quot;.

In the Philippines according to the recounts of Filipino survivors Narcisa Claveria, who was enslaved for 18 months at the age of 13, during the day the women were forced to cook, clean, and do laundry. At night the Japanese soldiers raped and abused the women. The story of the comfort women doing household chores during the day and being sexually abused at night was also recounted by another Filipino Survivor Fedencia David, who was kidnapped by Japanese soldiers at age 14, who also remembered being forced to wash clothes and cook for the Japanese soldiers. At night, she was raped by as many as 5 to 10 Japanese soldiers. Along with being raped multiple times a day the women were subjected to separation from their families, often watching their families being murdered by Japanese soldiers. One survivor recounts that when the Japanese soldiers took her, &quot;soldiers began to skin her father alive.&quot; This maltreatment left physical and emotional scars.

Military doctors and medical workers frequently raped the women during medical examinations. One Japanese Army doctor, Asō Tetsuo, testified that the comfort women were seen as &quot;female ammunition&quot; and as &quot;public toilets&quot;—as literally just things to be used and abused—with some comfort women being forced to donate blood for the treatment of wounded soldiers. At least 80% of the comfort women were Korean, who were assigned to the lower ranks, while Japanese and European women went to the officers. For example, Dutch women captured in the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) were reserved exclusively for the officers. Korea is a Confucian country where premarital sex was widely disapproved of, and since the Korean teenagers taken into the &quot;comfort women corps&quot; were almost always virgins, it was felt that this was the best way to limit the spread of venereal diseases that would otherwise incapacitate soldiers and sailors.
Ten Dutch women were taken by force from prison camps in Java by officers of the Imperial Japanese Army to become forced sex slaves in February 1944. They were systematically beaten and raped day and night. As a victim of the incident, in 1990, Jan Ruff-O&#x27;Herne testified to a U.S. House of Representatives committee:
In their first morning at the brothel, photographs of Ruff-O&#x27;Herne and the others were taken and placed on the veranda which was used as a reception area for the Japanese personnel who would choose from these photographs. Over the following four months the girls were raped and beaten day and night, with those who became pregnant forced to have abortions. After four harrowing months, the girls were moved to a camp at Bogor, in West Java, where they were reunited with their families. This camp was exclusively for women who had been put into military brothels, and the Japanese warned the inmates that if anyone told what had happened to them, they and their family members would be killed. Several months later the O&#x27;Hernes were transferred to a camp at Batavia, which was liberated on August 15, 1945.

Suki Falconberg, a comfort women survivor, shared her experiences:
At Blora, twenty European women and girls were imprisoned in two houses. Over a period of three weeks, as Japanese units passed by the houses, the women and their daughters were brutally and repeatedly raped.

In the Bangka Island, most of the Australian nurses captured were raped before they were murdered.

The Japanese officers involved received some punishment by Japanese authorities at the end of the war. After the end of the war, 11 Japanese officers were found guilty, with one soldier being sentenced to death by the Batavia War Criminal Court. The court decision found that the charge violated was the Army&#x27;s order to hire only voluntary women. Victims from East Timor testified they were forced into slavery even when they were not old enough to have started menstruating. The court testimonies state that these prepubescent girls were repeatedly raped by Japanese soldiers while those who refused to comply were killed.

Hank Nelson, emeritus professor at the Australian National University&#x27;s Asia Pacific Research Division, has written about the brothels run by the Japanese military in Rabaul, in what is now Papua New Guinea during WWII. He quotes from the diary of Gordon Thomas, a POW in Rabaul. Thomas writes that the women working at the brothels &quot;most likely served 25 to 35 men a day&quot; and that they were &quot;victims of the yellow slave trade&quot;. Nelson also quotes from Kentaro Igusa, a Japanese naval surgeon who was stationed in Rabaul. Igusa wrote in his memoirs that the women had to wash their genitals after each contact, but since some where unable to wash theirs effectively some due to inexperience, may have been a reason why they became infected with venereal disease, of which some of their genitalia became so badly swollen that they &quot;cried and begged for help&quot;. the women continued to work through infection and severe discomfort, using the newly released sulpha drugs which Igusa claims brought about quick cures. .

Contrarily, a report based on interrogation of 20 Korean comfort women and two Japanese civilians captured after the Siege of Myitkyina in Burma indicated that the comfort women lived comparatively well, received many gifts, and were paid wages while they were in Burma. The label &#x27;homecoming women&#x27;, originally referring to comfort women who returned to Korea, has remained as a pejorative term for sexually active women in South Korea.

=== Sterility, abortion and reproduction ===
The Japanese Army and Navy went to great lengths to avoid venereal diseases with large numbers of condoms being handed out for free. Japanese soldiers were required to use these &quot;Attack No. 1&quot;-branded condoms during sex. For example, documents show that in July 1943 the Army handed out 1,000 condoms for soldiers in Negri Sembilan and another 10,000 for soldiers in Perak. However, the women had no ability to resist or object when Japanese soldiers refused to wear condoms.

Comfort women were usually injected with salvarsan, which together with damage to the vagina caused by rape were the causes of unusually high rates of sterility among the comfort women.

As the war went on and as the shortages caused by the sinking of almost the entire Japanese merchant marine by American submarines kicked in, medical care for the comfort women declined as dwindling medical supplies were reserved for the servicemen. As Japanese logistics broke down as the American submarines sank one Japanese ship after another, condoms had to be washed and reused, reducing their effectiveness. Comfort women themselves and local laborers were required to wash and recycle the used condoms. In the Philippines, comfort women were billed by Japanese doctors if they required medical treatment. In many cases, comfort women who were seriously ill were abandoned to die alone.

The Survey of Korean Comfort Women Used by Japanese Soldiers said that 30% of the interviewed former Korean comfort women produced biological children and 20% adopted children after World War II.

== History of the issue ==
In 1944, Allied forces captured twenty Korean comfort women and two Japanese comfort station owners in Burma and issued a report, Japanese Prisoner of War Interrogation Report 49. According to the report, Korean women were deceived into being used as comfort women by the Japanese; in 1942, there were about 800 women trafficked from Korea to Burma for this purpose, under the pretence of being recruited for work such as visiting the wounded in hospitals or rolling bandages.

In Confucian cultures such as those of China and Korea, where premarital sex is considered shameful, the subject of the comfort women was ignored for decades after 1945 as the victims were considered pariahs. In Confucian cultures, traditionally an unmarried woman must value her chastity above her own life, and any women who loses her virginity before marriage for whatever reason is expected to commit suicide; by choosing to live, the survivors made themselves into outcasts. Moreover, documents such as the 1952 Treaty of San Francisco, as well as the 1965 treaty which normalised relations between Japan and South Korea, had been interpreted by the Japanese government as having their issues related to war crimes settled, despite the fact that none of them specifically mentioned the comfort women system.

The issue has been discussed in Korean newspapers since the war&#x27;s end, with the number of articles jumping in the 1960s, when negotiations towards the normalization of Japan-Korea relations were underway, and further spiking in the 1980s, after the discovery of living former comfort women.

An early figure in comfort women research was the writer Kakou Senda, who first encountered photographs of comfort women in 1962, but was unable to find adequate information explaining who the women in the photographs were. Senda, through a long process of investigation, published the first book on the subject, entitled &quot;Military Comfort Women&quot;, in 1973. Nonetheless, the book did not garner widespread publicity, and his book has been widely criticized as distorting the facts by both Japanese and South Korean historians. In any event, this book did become an important source for 1990s activism on the issue. The first book written by a Korean on the subject of comfort women appeared in 1981. However, it was a plagiarism of a 1976 Japanese book by the zainichi author Kim Il-Myeon.

In 1982, a dispute over history textbooks sprang up after the Ministry of Education ordered a number of deletions in history textbooks related to Japanese wartime aggression and atrocities. This ignited protest from neighbouring countries such as China and also sparked interest in the subject among some Japanese, including a number of wartime veterans who began to speak more openly about their past actions. However, the comfort women issue was not a central topic and instead most of this resurgence in historical interest went towards other themes such as the Nanjing Massacre and Unit 731. Nevertheless, historians who had studied Japan&#x27;s wartime activities in-depth were already aware of the existence of comfort women in general.

In August 2014, the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun retracted articles that were published based on or including information from Seiji Yoshida, who claimed that he was responsible for the forced abduction of comfort women. The paper clarified that this does not weaken the evidence supporting the existence of comfort women. Following the retraction, attacks from conservatives increased. Takashi Uemura, a journalist who published an article in 1991 but was forced to retract it years later, faced threats and attacks from conservatives, with his employer, Hokusei Gakuen University, also receiving bomb threats from the same group. Ultranationalists further targeted his children, posting online messages encouraging people to drive his teenage daughter to suicide. Uemura sued for libel but lost his case against Professor Tsutomu Nishioka and Japanese news magazine &quot;Shūkan Bunshun&quot;.

The existence of comfort women in South Korea and activism in their favour began to build momentum following democratisation in 1987, but no former comfort woman had yet come forward publicly. After the Japanese government denied that the state was involved and rejected calls for apologies and compensation in a June 1991 Diet session, Kim Hak-sun came forward in August 1991 as the first to tell her story. She was followed by others in several different countries demanding an apology from the Japanese government through lawsuits being filed. The Japanese government initially denied any responsibility, but, in January 1992, historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi discovered official documents from the archives of the Defense Agency&#x27;s National Institute of Defense Studies which indicated Japanese military involvement in establishing and running &quot;comfort stations.&quot; Following this, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa became the first Japanese leader to issue a statement specifically apologising for the comfort women issue. This led to an intense increase of public interest in the topic as well. In 1993, following multiple testimonies, the Kono Statement (named after then Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono) was issued by Japanese Government confirming that coercion was involved in seizing the comfort women.

All of this has since triggered a counterreaction from Japanese right-wing forces since the mid-1990&#x27;s, with disputes over history textbooks being a common example. In 1999, the Japanese historian Kazuko Watanabe complained about a lack of sisterhood among Japanese women, citing a survey showing 50% of Japanese women did not believe in the stories of the comfort women, charging that many Japanese simply regard other Asians as &quot;others&quot; whose feelings do not count. In 2004, Minister of Education Nariaki Nakayama made known his desire to remove references to comfort women from history textbooks, and textbooks approved in 2005 contained no mentions of comfort women at all. In 2007, the Japanese government issued a response to questions which had been posed to Prime Minister Abe about his position on the issue, concluding that &quot;No evidence was found that the Japanese army or the military officials seized the women by force.&quot; In 2014, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga formed a team to reexamine the background of the report. The review brought to light coordination between Japan and South Korea in the process of composing the Kono Statement and concluded that, at the request of Seoul, Tokyo stipulated coercion was involved in recruiting the women. After the review, Suga and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stated that Japan continues to uphold the Kono Statement.

In 2014, China released documents it said were &quot;ironclad proof&quot; that the comfort women were forced to work as prostitutes against their will, including documents from the Japanese Kwantung Army military police corps archives and documents from the national bank of Japan&#x27;s puppet regime in Manchuria.

In 2019, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan asserted officially the view that the expression &quot;sex slaves&quot; contradicts the facts and should not be used, noting that this point had been confirmed with South Korea in a Japan-South Korea agreement.

=== Apologies and compensation 1951–2009 ===

The governments of South Korea and Japan maintained a cold relationship during the first republic under President Syngman Rhee. After several failed normalisation talks, no formal diplomatic relations were ever established by Rhee&#x27;s ousting in 1960. The second republic under Prime Minister Jang Myeon made some progress on these talks, but this government was overthrown only a year later in the 1961 May 16 coup, and normalisation was once again delayed. The third republic was led by Park Chung-hee, a military strongman who served in the Japanese-aligned Manchukuo army during World War II. His administration placed high priority on normalising ties between the two states in order to facilitate his plans for economic modernisation and industrialisation. In talks between the two sides around 1964, Park&#x27;s side initially demanded $364 million in compensation for Koreans forced into labor and military service during the Japanese occupation: $200 per survivor, $1,650 per death and $2,000 per injured person. Tokyo offered to compensate the victims directly, but Seoul insisted that Japan simply give the South Korean government financial aid instead. In the final agreement reached in the 1965 treaty, Japan provided an $800 million aid and low-interest loan package over 10 years. Park&#x27;s government &quot;spent most of the money on economic development, focusing on infrastructure and the promotion of heavy industry&quot;.

Initially, the Japanese government denied any involvement in the comfort women system, until Yoshimi Yoshiaki discovered and published documents from the Japanese Self-Defense Agency&#x27;s library that suggested direct military involvement. In 1994, under public pressure, the Japanese government admitted its complicity and created the public-private Asian Women&#x27;s Fund (AWF) to compensate former comfort women. The fund was also used to present an official Japanese narrative about the issue. Sixty one Korean, 13 Taiwanese, 211 Filipino, and 79 Dutch former comfort women were provided with a signed apology from the then prime minister Tomiichi Murayama, stating &quot;As Prime Minister of Japan, I thus extend anew my most sincere apologies and remorse to all the women who underwent immeasurable and painful experiences and suffered incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women.&quot; Many former Korean comfort women rejected the compensations on principle – although the Asian Women&#x27;s Fund was set up by the Japanese government, its money came not from the government but from private donations, hence the compensation was not &quot;official&quot;. Eventually, 61 former Korean comfort women accepted 5 million yen (approx. $42,000) per person from the AWF along with the signed apology, while 142 others received funds from the government of Korea. The fund was dissolved on March 31, 2007. However, the establishment of the AWF was criticized as a way for the Japanese government to evade state responsibility; the establishment of the fund also prompted protests from various Asian countries.

Three South Korean women filed suit in Japan in December 1991, around the time of the 50th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, demanding compensation for forced prostitution. In 1992, documents which had been stored since 1958 when they were returned by United States troops and which indicated that the military had played a large role in operating what were euphemistically called &quot;comfort stations&quot; were found in the library of Japan&#x27;s Self-Defense Agency. The Japanese Government admitted that the Imperial Japanese Army had forced tens of thousands of Korean women to have sex with Japanese soldiers during World War II. On January 14, 1992, Japanese Chief Government Spokesman Koichi Kato issued an official apology saying, &quot;We cannot deny that the former Japanese army played a role&quot; in abducting and detaining the &quot;comfort girls,&quot; and &quot;We would like to express our apologies and contrition&quot;. Three days later on January 17, 1992, at a dinner given by South Korean President Roh Tae Woo, the Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told his host: &quot;We Japanese should first and foremost recall the truth of that tragic period when Japanese actions inflicted suffering and sorrow upon your people. We should never forget our feelings of remorse over this. As Prime Minister of Japan, I would like to declare anew my remorse at these deeds and tender my apology to the people of the Republic of Korea.&quot; He apologized again the following day in a speech before South Korea&#x27;s National Assembly. On April 28, 1998, the Japanese court ruled that the Government must compensate the women and awarded them each.

In 2007, the surviving women wanted an apology from the Japanese government. Shinzō Abe, the prime minister at the time, stated on March 1, 2007, that there was no evidence that the Japanese government had kept sex slaves, even though the Japanese government had already admitted the use of coercion in 1993. On March 27 the Japanese parliament issued an official apology.

=== Apologies and compensation since 2010 ===
On February 20, 2014, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the Japanese government may reconsider the study and the apology. However, Prime Minister Abe clarified on March 14, 2014, that he had no intention of renouncing or altering it.

On December 28, 2015, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Park Geun-hye formally agreed to settle the dispute. Abe again expressed his most sincere apologies and remorse to all the women. He acknowledged that they had undergone immeasurable and painful experiences and suffered incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women. He stated that Japan continued to hold the position that issues relating to property and claims between Japan and the ROK, including the issue of comfort women, had been settled completely and finally by the Japan-ROK Claims Settlement and Economic Cooperation Agreement of 1965 and welcomed the fact that the issue of comfort women is resolved &quot;finally and irreversibly&quot; with this agreement.
Japan agreed to pay ¥1 billion (₩9.7 billion; $8.3 million) to a fund supporting surviving victims while South Korea agreed to refrain from criticizing Japan regarding the issue and to work to remove a statue memorializing the victims from in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul. The announcement came after Japan&#x27;s Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida met his counterpart Yun Byung-se in Seoul, and later Prime Minister Shinzo Abe phoned President Park Geun-hye to repeat an apology already offered by Kishida. The Korean government will administer the fund for the forty-six remaining elderly comfort women and will consider the matter &quot;finally and irreversibly resolved&quot;. However, one Korean news organization, Hankyoreh, said that it fails to include the request from the survivals of sexual slavery to state the Japanese government&#x27;s legal responsibility for the state-level crime of enforcing a system of sexual slavery. The South Korean government did not attempt to collect the viewpoints on the issues from the women most directly affected by it—the survivors themselves. Concerning the deal between two countries, literally, Seoul and Tokyo failed to reach a breakthrough on the comfort women issue during the 11th round of Foreign Ministry director-general level talks on December 15, 2015. Several comfort women protested the agreement as they claim they did not want money, but to see a sincere acknowledgement of the legal responsibility by the Japanese government. The co-representative of a support group of the surviving women expressed that the settlement with Japan does not reflect the will of the comfort women, and they vowed to seek its invalidation by reviewing legal options.

On February 16, 2016, the United Nations&#x27; Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Seventh and Eighth Periodic Reports, was held, with Shinsuke Sugiyama, Deputy Minister for Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan), reiterating the official and final agreement between Japan and South Korea to pay ¥1 billion. Sugiyama also restated the Japanese Government apology of that agreement: &quot;The issue of comfort women, with an involvement of the Japanese military authorities at that time, was a grave affront to the honor and dignity of large numbers of women, and the Government of Japan is painfully aware of responsibilities.&quot;

In August 2016, twelve comfort women filed suit against the government of South Korea, declaring that the government had nullified the victims&#x27; individual rights to claim damages from Japan by signing an agreement not to demand further legal responsibility without consulting with the victims themselves. The suit claimed the 2015 deal violated a 2011 Constitutional Court ruling that the South Korean government must &quot;offer its cooperation and protection so that citizens whose human dignity and values have been violated through illegal actions perpetrated by Japan can invoke their rights to demand damages from Japan.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;http://english.hani.co.kr- 17 June 2018&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, South Korea&#x27;s president Moon Jae-in called the 2015 agreement &quot;undeniable&quot; and said that it &quot;finally and irreversibly&quot; was an official agreement between the two countries; however, when referring to aspects of the agreement he found flawed, he said: &quot;A knot wrongly tied should be untied.&quot; These remarks came a day after the government announced it would not seek to renew the 2015 agreement, but that it wanted Japan to do more to settle the issue. Moon said: &quot;A real settlement would come if the victims can forgive, after Japan makes a sincere apology and takes other actions&quot;.
In March 2018, the Japanese government argued that the 2015 Japan-South Korea agreement confirmed that this issue was finally and irreversibly resolved and lodged a strong protest to South Korea through diplomatic channels, stating that &quot;such a statement goes against the agreement and is therefore completely unacceptable and extremely regrettable&quot;.

On June 15, 2018, The 20th civil division of Seoul Central District Court dismissed the comfort women&#x27;s suit seeking damages against the South Korean government for signing the 2015 agreement with Japan. The court announced that the intergovernmental comfort women agreement &quot;certainly lacked transparency or was deficient in recognizing &#x27;legal responsibility&#x27; and on the nature of the one billion yen provided by the Japanese government&quot;. However, &quot;an examination of the process and content leading up to the agreement cannot be seen as discharging the plaintiffs&#x27; right to claim damages.&quot; An attorney for the survivors said they would be appealing the decision on the basis that it recognizes the lawfulness of the 2015 Japan-South Korean agreement.

On January 8, 2021, Seoul Central District Court ordered the government of Japan to pay reparations of 100 million won ($91,300) each to the families of the twelve women.
On the court case, referring to the principle of Sovereign immunity guaranteed by International law, the Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said that &quot;a sovereign state should not be put under the jurisdiction of foreign courts&quot;, claiming that the lawsuit should be rejected. And Suga stressed that the issue is already settled completely and finally, through &quot;.
On the same day, Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi also spoke about the lawsuit of a claim for damages against Japanese government consistently in Extraordinary Press Conference from Brazil.

In April 2021, in a separate case, a judge at Seoul Central District Court rejected an effort to order Japan to compensate 20 comfort women and their relatives, citing state immunity and &quot;an inevitable diplomatic clash&quot; between Japan and South Korea governments should the lawsuit proceeded. Lee Yong-soo, a former comfort woman and one of the plaintiffs, said she would seek international litigation.

On June 25, 2021, the Japanese government announced that Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga stands by statements made by past administrations apologizing for Japan&#x27;s aggression in World War II and admitting the military had a role in coercing comfort women, &quot;largely from the Korean Peninsula&quot;, to work in brothels.

In November 2023, Seoul High Court overturned the April 2021 ruling saying state immunity was not applicable to the case because Japan violated international treaties to which it was a party (as well as Japan&#x27;s own criminal law) that banned sexual slavery and other crimes by the time of World War II. Additionally, the court ordered Japan&#x27;s government to pay 200 million South Korean wons (US$154,000) in damages to a group of comfort women, most of whom had already died and were represented by their families. Japan condemned the ruling as &quot;extremely regrettable and absolutely unacceptable&quot;, and summoned South Korean ambassador to Japan Yun Duk Min to protest it.

=== Concerns and controversies regarding apologies ===
Apologies from Japanese officials have faced scrutiny for their lack of sincerity. For instance, in the Kono Statement, while acknowledging the Japanese military&#x27;s role in the comfort women system, officials denied coercion and forced transportation of women, and declined to provide compensation to the victims. Kono&#x27;s apology was meticulous in distinguishing the actions of the Japanese army from those of the Japanese government, ensuring that the Japanese government bore no legal liability or responsibility for its treatment of the comfort women. Also, many victims viewed the apology as insufficient because it was delivered by the Cabinent Secretary of Japan and never officially adopted by the Japanese Parliament. Subsequent apologies were also criticized as insincere because they were delivered by the current prime minister of Japan rather than the National Diet, which would have signified an apology backed by the Japanese government. Subsequent apologies written and signed by the standing prime minister of Japan were distributed by the Asian Women&#x27;s Fund, which is a non-governmental organization, rendering these apologies unofficial.

Japan has largely disregarded recommendations from the United Nations Human Rights Council, as well as the rulings from the Women&#x27;s International War Crimes Tribunal concerning Japan&#x27;s military sexual slavery. Japan has resisted pressure from other countries, including the United States and the European Union, who have passed resolutions urging the Japanese government to respond. Instead, Japan has indicated that it does not consider these statements legally binding and therefore does not feel obligated to act upon them.

=== Controversies ===
A 2001 comic book, &quot;Neo Gomanism Manifesto Special – On Taiwan&quot; by Japanese author Yoshinori Kobayashi, depicts kimono-clad women lining up to sign up for duty before a Japanese soldier. Kobayashi&#x27;s book contains an interview with Taiwanese industrialist Shi Wen-long, who stated that no women were forced to serve and that the women worked in more hygienic conditions compared to regular prostitutes because the use of condoms was mandatory.

Moreover, &#x27;patriotic&#x27; emerging faiths like &quot;Kofuku no Kagaku&quot; (&#x27;Science of Happiness&#x27;) and certain Christian factions advocating for the merging of religion and state have initiated a concerted effort domestically and internationally to deny the existence of the comfort women system. They&#x27;ve gathered extensive support from Japanese citizens who refute the existence of the comfort women issue, alleging it as a concoction by left-leaning factions. Several leaders of these groups are women.

In early 2001, in a controversy involving national public broadcaster NHK, what was supposed to be coverage of the Women&#x27;s International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan&#x27;s Military Sexual Slavery was heavily edited to reflect revisionist views. In 2014, the new president of NHK compared the wartime Japanese comfort women program to Asian brothels frequented by American troops, which western historians countered by pointing out the difference between the Japanese comfort stations, which forced women to have sex with Japanese troops, and Asian brothels, where women chose to be prostitutes for American troops.

In publications around 2007, Japanese historian and Nihon University professor Ikuhiko Hata estimates the number of comfort women to have been more likely between 10,000 and 20,000. Hata claims that &quot;none of the comfort women were forcibly recruited&quot;. Historian Chunghee Sarah Soh noted that Hata&#x27;s initial estimate was at approximately 90,000, but he reduced that figure to 20,000 for political reasons. He has been criticized by other Japanese scholars for minimizing the hardship of comfort women.

In 2012, the former mayor of Osaka and co-leader of the Japan Restoration Party, Tōru Hashimoto initially maintained that &quot;there is no evidence that people called comfort women were taken away by violence or threat by the [Japanese] military&quot;. He later modified his position, asserting that they became comfort women &quot;against their will by any circumstances around them&quot;, still justifying their role during World War II as &quot;necessary&quot;, so that soldiers could &quot;have a rest&quot;.

In 2014, Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone chaired a commission established to consider &quot;concrete measures to restore Japan&#x27;s honor with regard to the comfort women issue&quot;, despite his own father Yasuhiro Nakasone, having organized a &quot;comfort station&quot; in 1942 when he was a lieutenant paymaster in Japan&#x27;s Imperial Navy.

In 2014, the Japanese Foreign Ministry attempted to pressure McGraw Hill into erasing several paragraphs on comfort women from one of their textbooks. The attempt was unsuccessful, and American academics criticized Japanese attempts to revise the history of comfort women.

In 2018, the &quot;Japan Times&quot; changed its description of the terms &quot;comfort woman&quot; and &quot;forced labourer&quot; causing a controversy among staff and readers.

On August 18, 2018, United Nations rights experts and UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination expressed that Japan should do more for sufferers of wartime sexual slavery. Japan responded by stating it has already made numerous apologies and offered compensation to the victims.

Since information disclosed by the Asian Women&#x27;s Fund can be attributed to parts of a speech delivered in 1965 by Japanese Diet Member Arafune Seijuro, some of the information mentioned by the fund remains controversial.

The Japanese government, and the mayor of Osaka, demanded the removal of comfort women monuments located in other countries, blatantly denying that women were coerced into sexual slavery during World War II. They have demanded the removal of comfort women statues in Palisades Park, New Jersey, United States; San Francisco, California, United States; and Berlin, Germany, with each demand rejected by the relevant authorities.

In 2019, about 24 members of Malaya Lolas, an organization that supports Filipina survivors of sexual slavery during World War II, filed a complaint at UN&#x27;s Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) regarding the Philippine government&#x27;s failure to fight for their cause, which resulted in ongoing discrimination against comfort women, that continues to this day. In 2023, CEDAW came up with a decision and recommended the government to provide the complainants with full reparation, including material compensation and an official apology for the continuing discrimination.
Based on a statement made by Representative Seijuro Arahune of the Japanese Diet in 1975 in which he claimed to cite numbers provided by Korean authorities during the 1965 Korea-Japan Treaty negotiations, as many as three-fourths of Korean comfort women may have died during the war. however, according to the Japanese government, the validity of this statement has since been brought into question as the number does not seem to be based on an actual investigation on the matter.

==== Asahi Shimbun Third-Party Investigative Committee ====
In August 2014, the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;, Japan&#x27;s second largest newspaper in circulation, retracted 16 articles published between 1982 and 1997. The articles were concerned with former imperial army officer Seiji Yoshida, who claimed he had forcibly taken Korean women to wartime Japanese military brothels from the Jeju Island region in South Korea. Following the retraction of the articles, the newspaper also refused to publish an op-ed on the matter by Japanese journalist Akira Ikegami. The public response and criticism that ensued pushed the newspaper to nominate a third-party investigative committee headed by seven leading scholars, journalists and legal experts. The committee report dealt with the circumstances leading to the publication of Yoshida&#x27;s false testimony and to the effect these publications had on Japan&#x27;s image abroad and diplomatic relations with various countries. It found that the Asahi was negligent in publishing Yoshida&#x27;s testimony, but that the reports on the testimony had &quot;limited&quot; effect on foreign media outlets and reports. On the other hand, the report found that Japanese officials&#x27; comments on the issue had a far more detrimental effect on Japan&#x27;s image and its diplomatic relations.

==== Fraud accusations against support groups ====
In 2004, 13 former comfort women filed a complaint against the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery and the House of Sharing with the Seoul Western District Court to prevent these two organizations from profiting and exploiting the victims&#x27; past experiences to collect donations. The victims accused Shin Hye-Soo, head of the Korean Council at the time, and Song Hyun-Seob, Head of the House of Sharing, of using the women&#x27;s past experiences in videos and leaflets without their permission to solicit donations and then keeping the money instead of using it to help the victims. The complaint further stated that a significant number of victims did not receive compensation through the citizen-funded Asian Women&#x27;s Fund established in 1995 by Japan due to the opposition from the organizations in 1998. In addition, they accused the institutions of recruiting six former comfort women survivors from China and paying them to get them to partake in weekly rallies. The complaint was dismissed by the court in May 2005.

Again, in May 2020, Lee Yong-soo, a comfort woman survivor and longtime activist for the victims, held a press conference and accused the Korean Council and its former head, Yoon Mee-hyang, of exploiting her and other survivors, politically and financially for decades, to obtain government funds and public donations through the protests while spending little money aiding them.

Consequently, a civic group filed a complaint against Yoon Mee-hyang, a lawmaker-elect and former head of the Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan. After an investigation, the Seoul Western District Prosecutors&#x27; Office indicted Yoon, on eight charges including fraud, embezzlement and breach of trust.  

Among the charges, Yoon was indicted for is a count of quasi-fraud against Gil Won-ok, a 92-year-old survivor. The prosecution said Gil suffers from dementia and that Yoon had exploited her reduced physical and mental capacities and pressed her to donate a total of 79.2 million won ($67,102) to the Korean Council between November 2017 and January 2020.

Additionally, she was accused of fraud and embezzlement of almost half a million dollars from governmental organizations and private donors, which were used to buy properties and even pay tuition for her daughter&#x27;s education at the University of California.

In a forensic audit of the comfort women&#x27;s shelter controlled by Yoon&#x27;s group, it was found that barely 2.3% of its massive $7.5 million budget raised since 2015 was actually spent on supporting the living needs of surviving comfort women, many of whom live in cramped quarters, with substandard care, with few luxuries.

In September 2020, the Democratic Party (DP) suspended Yoon&#x27;s party membership due to the charges that she was facing.

On November 14 2024, South Korea&#x27;s Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Yoon Mee-hyang, on charges of embezzlement. Yoon was sentenced to 18 months in prison, with the sentence suspended for three years. The court found her guilty of misappropriating funds intended for supporting victims.

==== International Court of Justice ====
The Comfort Women survivors have asked the Korean government multiple times to bring their case in front of the International Court of Justice, but South Korea has yet to respond.

==== International court cases ====

Members of the group &quot;Malaya Lolas&quot; in the Philippines have attempted to go to Tokyo to file a suit in the Japanese courts. The lolas were unable to file the lawsuit because according to the Japanese government the lolas could not file a lawsuit due to international law stating that the Malaya Lolas need to be represented by the Philippine government. The lolas filed a case in the Philippine courts, Vinuya et al. v. Executive Secretary et al. The case was directed at the Executive Secretary at the time, Alberto G. Romulo and the main plaintiff was the leader of Malaya Lolas, Isabelita Vinuya. The lolas filed this case to get the Philippine government to support them in pursuing a petition for compensation in the Japanese courts. The Philippine government won the case with the court stating that the Philippine government &quot;is not under any international obligation to espouse petitioners&#x27; claims.&quot;

=== International support ===
The cause has long been supported beyond the victim nations, and associations like Amnesty International are campaigning in countries where governments have yet to support the cause, like in Australia, or New Zealand.

Support in the United States continues to grow, particularly after the passage of United States House of Representatives House Resolution 121 on July 30, 2007. The resolution expresses that the government of Japan should formally redress the situation by acknowledging, apologizing and accepting historical responsibility for the use of comfort women by its armed forces; have the Prime Minister of Japan give a public apology; and educate their people using internationally accepted historical facts about the crime while refuting any claims that deny the crime. In July 2012, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a strong advocate of the cause, denounced the use of the euphemism &#x27;comfort women&#x27; for what should be referred to as &#x27;enforced sex slaves&#x27;. The Obama Administration also addressed the need for Japan to do more to address the issue. In addition to calling attention to the issue, the American memorial statues erected in New Jersey in 2010 and California in 2013 show support for what has become an international cause.

On November 28, 2007, the Parliament of Canada unanimously passed a motion that recognized Japan&#x27;s use of women as sex slaves during the Second World War, demanding Japan to make a formal sincere apology to all victims.

In 2007, the Netherland&#x27;s House of Representatives passed a resolution that urged Japan to apologize for its wartime sex slavery, and to pay compensations to former comfort women.

On December 13, 2007, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on &quot;Justice for the &#x27;Comfort Women&#x27; (sex slaves in Asia before and during World War II)&quot; calling on the Japanese government to apologise and accept legal responsibility for the coercion of young women into sexual slavery before and during WWII.

In 2014, Pope Francis met with seven former comfort women in South Korea. Also in 2014, the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called for Japan to, as the committee&#x27;s deputy head Anastasia Crickley puts it, &quot;conclude investigations into the violations of the rights of &#x27;comfort women&#x27; by the military and to bring to justice those responsible and to pursue a comprehensive and lasting resolution to these issues&quot;. U.N. Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay had also spoken out in support of comfort women several times.

=== Health-related issues ===
In the aftermath of the war, the women recalled bouts of physical and mental abuse that they had experienced while working in military brothels. In the Rorschach test, the women showed distorted perceptions, difficulty in managing emotional reactions and internalized anger. A 2011 clinical study found that comfort women are more prone to showing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), even 60 years after the end of the war.

=== Survivors ===
The last surviving victims have become public figures in Korea, where they are referred to as &quot;halmoni&quot;, the affectionate term for &quot;grandmother&quot;. There is a nursing home, called House of Sharing, for former comfort women in South Korea. China remains more at the testimony collection stage, particularly through the China &quot;Comfort Women&quot; Issue Research Center at Shanghai Normal University, sometimes in collaboration with Korean researchers. For other nations, the research and the interaction with victims is less advanced.

Despite the efforts at assigning responsibility and victims compensation, in the years after World War II, many former Korean comfort women were afraid to reveal their past, because they are afraid of being disowned or ostracized further.

== Memorials and organizations ==

=== China ===
On December 1, 2015, the first memorial hall dedicated to Chinese comfort women was opened in Nanjing. It was built on the site of a former comfort station run by the invading Japanese troops during World War II.
The memorial hall stands next to the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders.

In June 2016, the Research Center for Chinese Comfort Women was established at Shanghai Normal University. It is a museum that exhibits photographs and various items related to comfort women in China.

=== Taiwan ===

Since the 1990s, Taiwanese survivors have been bringing to light the comfort woman issue in Taiwanese society, and gaining support from women&#x27;s rights activists and civil groups. Their testimony and memories have been documented by newspapers, books, and documentary films.

Survivors&#x27; claims against the Japan government have been backed by the Taipei Women&#x27;s Rescue Foundation (TWRF) a non-profit organization helping women against violence, and sexual violence. This organization gives legal and psychological support to Taiwanese comfort women, and also helps in the recording of testimony and doing scholarly research. In 2007, this organization was responsible for promoting awareness in society, by creating meetings in universities and high schools where survivors gave their testimonies to students and the general public. TWRF has produced exhibitions that give survivors the opportunity to be heard in Taipei, and also in the Women&#x27;s Active Museum on War and Peace, based in Tokyo.

Thanks to this increasing awareness in society, and with the help of TWRF, Taiwanese comfort women have gained the support their government, which on many occasions has asked the Japanese government for apologies and compensation.

In November 2014, &quot;Song of the Reed&quot;, a documentary film directed by Wu Hsiu-ching and produced by TWRF, won the International Gold Panda documentary award.

In December 2016, a museum dedicated to comfort women opened in Taipei.

On August 14, 2018, the first &#x27;comfort women&#x27; statue in Taiwan was unveiled in the city of Tainan. The statue symbolizes women forced to work in wartime brothels for the Japanese military. The bronze statue portrays a girl raising both hands to the sky to express her helpless resistance to suppression and silent protest, according to its creator.
In September 2018, Japanese right-wing activist kicked the statue and caused outrage in Taiwan, with the Taiwanese government branding his behavior as unacceptable. A Japanese right-wing group with affiliations to him apologized for his behavior and said he resigned from his group position. In 2024, the land that the statue was on was sold at auction and the statue was put into a warehouse.

=== South Korea ===

==== Wednesday demonstrations ====

Every Wednesday, living comfort women, women&#x27;s organizations, socio-civic groups, religious groups, and a number of individuals participate in the Wednesday Demonstrations in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, sponsored by &quot;The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan (KCWDMSS)&quot;. It was first held on January 8, 1992, when Japan&#x27;s Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visited South Korea. In December 2011, a statue of a young woman was erected in front of the Japanese Embassy to honor the comfort women on the 1,000th Wednesday Demonstration. The Japanese government has repeatedly asked the South Korean government to have the statue taken down, but it has not been removed.

On December 28, 2015, the Japanese government claimed that the Korean government agreed to the removal of the statue. As of September 3, 2016, the statue was still in place due to a majority of the South Korean population being opposed to the agreement. On December 30, 2016, another comfort woman statue identical to the one in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul was erected in front of the Japanese consulate in Busan, South Korea. As of January 6, 2017, the Japanese government is attempting to negotiate for the removal of the statue. On May 11, 2017, newly elected South Korean President Moon Jae-in announced the agreement would not be enacted in its current stage and that negotiations for a deal between Japan and South Korea over the comfort women dispute had to start over.

On June 30, 2017, the local government of Busan enacted the legal foundation to protect the Statue of Peace by passing the relative ordinance. By reason of this, it has become difficult to shift the site or demolish the statue.

On August 14, 2018, South Korea held an unveiling ceremony for a monument memorializing Korean women forced to work in wartime brothels for the Japanese military, as the nation observed its first official comfort women memorial day.

On November 21, 2018, South Korea officially cancelled the 2015 agreement and shut down the Japan-funded comfort women foundation which was launched in July 2016 to finance the agreement&#x27;s settlement to the victims. The settlement had received criticism from victims&#x27; groups.

==== House of Sharing ====

The House of Sharing is a nursing home for living comfort women. The House of Sharing was founded in June 1992 through funds raised by Buddhist organizations and various socio-civic groups and it moved to Gyeonggi-do, South Korea in 1998. The House of Sharing includes &quot;The Museum of Sexual Slavery by Japanese Military&quot; to spread the truth about the Japanese military&#x27;s brutal abuse of comfort women and to educate descendants and the public.

==== Archives by comfort women ====
Some of the survivors, Kang Duk-kyung, Kim Soon-duk and Lee Yong-Nyeo, preserved their personal history through their drawings as a visual archive. Also, the director of the Center for Asian American Media, Dai Sil Kim-Gibson, made a comfort women video archive, a documentary film for K–12 through college level students. Feminist visual and video archives have promoted a place for solidarity between the victims and the public. It has served as a living site for the teaching and learning of women&#x27;s dignity and human rights by bringing people together despite age, gender, borders, nationality, and ideologies.

=== Philippines ===

Comfort women in the Philippines, called &quot;Lolas&quot; (grandmothers), formed different groups similar to the Korean survivors. One group, named &quot;Lila Pilipina&quot; (League of Filipino Women), started in 1992 and is member of GABRIELA, a feminist organization. In their brochure they list their demands in two categories, ones to the Japanese government and those for the Philippine government. From the Japanese government Lila Pilipina has five demands:

# &quot;that Japan fulfills its responsibility in the full disclosure of all information in its war archives concerning the operation of the &quot;comfort stations&quot; and the &quot;comfort women&quot; system
# &quot;adequate compensation for the women victims and their families from the Japanese government,&quot;
# &quot;for the Japanese government to include as reference in its textbooks and history books the reality of military sexual slavery through &quot;comfort women&quot; during World War II as a crime,&quot;
# &quot;for the Japanese government to admit the use of force and violence in the conscription and treatment of the &quot;comfort women&quot; as military sex slaves, contrary to Japanese government report,&quot;
# &quot;a formal apology to the Filipino people and specifically to the women victims and their families for having a direct hand in the conscription of Asian women for military sexual slavery.&quot;

From the Philippine government Lila Pilipina also has five demands:

# &quot;to issue an official position declaring the comfort women system as a war crime, condemning the Japanese government in its direct involvement for institutionalized sexual slavery and demanding formal apology and compensation for the victims and their families,&quot;
# &quot;to conduct an official investigation and documentation of the comfort women issue,&quot;
# &quot;to include the reality of the &quot;comfort women&quot; and &quot;comfort stations&quot; during World War II in Philippine history. These include the curriculum, textbooks and other instructional materials used both in public and private educational institutions in all levels,&quot;
# &quot;to build historical markers and shrines around the country for the comfort women and war victims of World War II as a reminder to the present generation of the sad realities behind wars of aggression,&quot;
# &quot;to provide material support for the victims, survivors, and their families.&quot;

Lila Pilipina together with the Malaya Lolas (Free grandmothers) took legal actions against Japan. These groups also ask the Philippine government to back their claims against the Japanese government. These groups have taken legal actions against Japan. Malaya Lolas had attempted to go to Tokyo to file a suit in the Japanese courts. Still, according to the Japanese government, the lolas themselves could not file a lawsuit due to international law stating that the lolas need to be represented by the Philippine government. In 2004 the Malaya Lolas filed a cause, Vinuya et al. v. Executive Secretary et al., asking for the support of the Philippine government in pursuing a petition for compensation in the Japanese courts. A decision was made on April 28, 2010, supporting the Philippine government. , after failing in legal action against their own government to back their claims, they planned to take the case the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and Children (CEDAW).

These groups have made demonstrations in front of the Japanese embassy in Manila on many occasions, and have given testimonies to Japanese tourists in Manila. The Filipino news channel ABS-CBN has done interviews with the surviving lolas to bring awareness to the experience of lolas under the Japanese occupation and to remind people that Japan&#x27;s crimes were not committed that long ago and should not be forgotten.

Similar to the Korean grandmothers, Filipino &quot;Lolas&quot; have their own Grandmother house with a collection of their testimonies. Also two of them have published two autobiographic books: &quot;Comfort Woman: Slave of Destiny&quot; by Rosa Henson and &quot;The Hidden Battle of Leyte: The Picture Diary of a Girl Taken by the Japanese Military&quot; by Remedios Felias. This second book was written in the 1990s, after Lila Filipina was formed.

In Bulacan, there is an empty villa house Bahay na Pula (meaning Red House in English) which was seized by Japanese soldiers during WWII and had been used as a comfort station where Filipino women were raped and held as comfort women. The Bahay na Pula is seen as a memorial to the forgotten Filipino comfort women in the Philippines.

On December 8, 2017, the &#x27;Filipina Comfort Women&#x27; statue by artist Jonas Roces was installed in Baywalk, Roxas Boulevard in Manila. About four months later, the statue was removed by government officials due to a &quot;drainage improvement project&quot; along the Baywalk. It was later declared missing in 2019 when the statue artist Jonas Roces failed to deliver the statue for its reinstallation at the Baclaran Church.

In 2019, a similar memorial statue in a Catholic-run shelter for the elderly and the homeless in San Pedro, Laguna was removed only two days after it was unveiled to the public. The bronze statue of a young woman with fists resting on her lap was removed without explanation and notice. The move came after the Japanese embassy complained.

=== United States ===
In 2010, the first American monument dedicated to the comfort women was established in Palisades Park, New Jersey.

On March 8, 2013, Bergen County erected a comfort women memorial on the lawn of the Bergen County Courthouse in Hackensack, NJ.

In 2013, a memorial statue to comfort women called &quot;Peace Monument of Glendale&quot; was established in Glendale, California. The statue has been subject to multiple legal attempts to remove it. A 2014 lawsuit seeking the statue&#x27;s removal was dismissed.

On May 30, 2014, a memorial was dedicated behind the Fairfax County Government Center in Virginia.

On August 16, 2014, a new memorial statue honoring the comfort women was unveiled in Southfield, Michigan.

In June 2017, Brookhaven, Georgia unveiled a statue memorializing the Comfort Women of World War II.

On September 22, 2017, in an initiative led by the local Chinese-American community, San Francisco erected a privately funded San Francisco Comfort Women Memorial to the comfort women of World War II. Some Japanese and Japanese-American opponents of the initiative argue the statue would promote hatred and anti-Japanese sentiment throughout the community and object to the statue singling out Japan. Tōru Hashimoto, the mayor of Osaka, Japan, objected that the memorial should be &quot;broadened to memorialize all the women who have been sexually assaulted and abused by soldiers of countries in the world&quot;. Supporting the statue, Heather Knight of the San Francisco Chronicle pointed to the San Francisco Holocaust Memorial and the landmarked Japanese internment camps in California as evidence that Japan is &quot;not being singled out&quot;. In protest over the statue, Osaka ended the sister city relationship with San Francisco that had been established since 1957. When the city accepted the statue as public property in 2018, the mayor of Osaka sent a 10-page letter to the mayor of San Francisco, complaining of inaccuracies and unfairly singling out Japan for criticism.

A 2010 proposal to create a memorial in Koreatown, Fort Lee, New Jersey has been controversial and was undecided .

On May 23, 2018, a comfort women memorial was installed in Constitution Park in Fort Lee, NJ. Youth Council of Fort Lee, a student organization led by Korean American high school students in Fort Lee designed the memorial.

=== Germany ===
In March 2017, the first comfort women statue in Europe was elected in Wiesent, Bavaria, Germany. The statue was a replica of the bronze statue installed in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul. Another German city, Freiburg, had planned to set up a comfort woman statue there but it was scrapped due to &quot;strong obstruction and pressure&quot; by Japan.

=== Canada ===

In 2016, the first statue in Canada devoted to comfort women was placed in Toronto.

===Australia===

A comfort women statue was unveiled in Sydney in August 2016. The 1.5-metre statue imported from Korea was originally meant for a public park in Strathfield, but local council rejected it. Reverend Bill Crews then agreed to install the statue outside his church, Ashfield Uniting Church. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s finally found a home.&quot;

<text>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, also known as Tristram Shandy, is a novel by Laurence Sterne. It was published in nine volumes, the first two appearing in 1759, and seven others following over the next seven years (vols. 3 and 4, 1761; vols. 5 and 6, 1762; vols. 7 and 8, 1765; vol. 9, 1767). It purports to be a biography of the eponymous character. Its style is marked by digression, double entendre, and graphic devices. The first edition was printed by Ann Ward on Coney Street, York.

Sterne had read widely, which is reflected in &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;. Many of his similes, for instance, are reminiscent of the works of the metaphysical poets of the 17th century, and the novel as a whole, with its focus on the problems of language, has constant regard for John Locke&#x27;s theories in &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;. Arthur Schopenhauer called &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; one of &quot;the four immortal romances&quot;.

While the use of the narrative technique of stream of consciousness is usually associated with modernist novelists, &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; has been suggested as a precursor.

==Synopsis and style==
As its title suggests, the book is ostensibly Tristram&#x27;s narration of his life story. But it is one of the central jokes of the novel that he cannot explain anything simply, that he must make explanatory diversions to add context and colour to his tale, to the extent that Tristram&#x27;s own birth is not even reached until Volume III.

Consequently, apart from Tristram as narrator, the most familiar and important characters in the book are his father Walter, his mother, his Uncle Toby, Toby&#x27;s servant Trim, and a supporting cast of popular minor characters, including the chambermaid Susannah, Doctor Slop and the parson Yorick, who later became Sterne&#x27;s favourite &quot;nom de plume&quot; and a very successful publicity stunt. Yorick is also the protagonist of Sterne&#x27;s second work of fiction, &quot;A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy&quot;.

Most of the action is concerned with domestic upsets or misunderstandings, which find humour in the opposing temperaments of Walter—splenetic, rational, and somewhat sarcastic—and Uncle Toby, who is gentle, uncomplicated, and a lover of his fellow man.

In between such events, Tristram as narrator finds himself discoursing at length on sexual practices, insults, the influence of one&#x27;s name and noses, as well as explorations of obstetrics, siege warfare and philosophy, as he struggles to marshal his material and finish the story of his life.

Though Tristram is always present as narrator and commentator, the book contains little of his life, only the story of a trip through France and accounts of the four comical mishaps which shaped the course of his life from an early age. Firstly, while he was still only an homunculus, Tristram&#x27;s implantation within his mother&#x27;s uterus was disturbed. At the very moment of procreation, his mother asked his father if he had remembered to wind the clock. The distraction and annoyance led to the disruption of the proper balance of humours necessary to conceive a well-favoured child. Secondly, one of his father&#x27;s pet theories was that a large and attractive nose was important to a man making his way in life. In a difficult birth, Tristram&#x27;s nose was crushed by Dr. Slop&#x27;s forceps.

Another of his father&#x27;s theories was that a person&#x27;s name exerted enormous influence over that person&#x27;s nature and fortunes, with the worst possible name being Tristram. In view of the previous accidents, Tristram&#x27;s father decreed that the boy would receive an especially auspicious name, Trismegistus. Susannah mangled the name in conveying it to the curate, and the child was christened Tristram. According to his father&#x27;s theory, his name, being a conflation of &quot;Trismegistus&quot; (after the esoteric mystic Hermes Trismegistus) and &quot;Tristan&quot; (whose connotation bore the influence through folk etymology of Latin &quot;tristis&quot;, &quot;sorrowful&quot;), doomed him to a life of woe and cursed him with the inability to comprehend the causes of his misfortune.

Finally, as a toddler, Tristram suffered an accidental circumcision when Susannah let a window sash fall as he urinated out of the window because his chamberpot was missing.

==Main characters==
* Tristram Shandy, narrator, although not present very much in the story.
* Walter Shandy, Tristram&#x27;s opinionated father.
* Mrs. Shandy, his wife.
* Toby Shandy, Tristram&#x27;s uncle, and Walter&#x27;s brother; a war veteran.
* Trim, his corporal and servant.
* Yorick, the tall, lank parson; Tristram speculates that he descends from Shakespeare&#x27;s Yorick.
* Dr. Slop, a doctor, or &quot;man-midwife&quot;, as Walter calls him.

== Narrative structure and reader involvement ==

Sterne&#x27;s presence inside the narrative changed the course of traditional novelistic interpretations as his narrative structure digresses through many jumbled and fragmentary events into a non-traditional, dual overlapping plot. These digressive methods reflect his inability to simply explain each event as it occurs, as he frequently interrupts these events with commentary about how the reader should understand and follow each event.

He relies heavily on his reader&#x27;s close involvement to the text and their interpretations of the non-traditional plot. Tristram&#x27;s presence inside of the narrative as the narrator engages the imagination, and his use of visual strategies, such as the marbled and blank pages, reflects the importance of the reader&#x27;s participation in the novel.

==Techniques and influences==
===Artistic incorporation and accusations of plagiarism===
Sterne incorporated into &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; many passages taken almost word for word from Robert Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;, Francis Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Of Death&quot;, Rabelais and many more, and rearranged them to serve the new meaning intended in &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;. &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; was highly praised for its originality, and nobody noticed these borrowings until years after Sterne&#x27;s death. The first to note them was physician, poet and Portico Library Chair John Ferriar, who did not see them negatively and commented:

Ferriar believed that Sterne was ridiculing Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;, mocking its solemn tone and endeavours to prove indisputable facts by weighty quotations.

Victorian critics of the 19th century, who were hostile to Sterne for the alleged obscenity of his prose, used Ferriar&#x27;s findings to defame Sterne, and claimed that he was artistically dishonest, and almost unanimously accused him of mindless plagiarism. Scholar Graham Petrie closely analysed the alleged passages in 1970; he observed that while more recent commentators now agree that Sterne &quot;rearranged what he took to make it more humorous, or more sentimental, or more rhythmical&quot;, none of them &quot;seems to have wondered whether Sterne had any further, more purely artistic, purpose&quot;. Studying a passage in Volume V, chapter 3, Petrie observes: &quot;such passage...reveals that Sterne&#x27;s copying was far from purely mechanical, and that his rearrangements go far beyond what would be necessary for merely stylistic ends&quot;.

===Rabelais===
A major influence on &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; is Rabelais&#x27; &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;. Rabelais was by far Sterne&#x27;s favourite author, and in his correspondence he made clear that he considered himself Rabelais&#x27;s successor in humorous writing. One passage Sterne incorporated pertains to &quot;the length and goodness of the nose&quot;. Sterne had written an earlier piece called &quot;A Rabelaisian Fragment&quot; that indicates his familiarity with the work of the French monk and doctor.

===Ridiculing solemnity===
Sterne was no friend of gravitas, a quality which excited his disgust. &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; gives a ludicrous turn to solemn passages from respected authors that it incorporates, as well as to the &quot;consolatio&quot; literary genre.

Among the subjects of such ridicule were some of the opinions contained in Robert Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;, a book that mentions sermons as the most respectable type of writing, and one that was favoured by the learned. Burton&#x27;s attitude was to try to prove indisputable facts by weighty quotations. His book consists mostly of a collection of the opinions of a multitude of writers (he modestly refrains from adding his own) divided into quaint and old-fashioned categories. It discusses everything, from the doctrines of religion to military discipline, from inland navigation to the morality of dancing schools.

Much of the singularity of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;″s characters is drawn from Burton. Burton indulges himself in a Utopian sketch of a perfect government in his introductory address to the reader, and this forms the basis of the notions of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; on the subject. And Sterne parodies Burton&#x27;s use of weighty quotations. The first four chapters of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; are founded on some passages in Burton.

In Chapter 3, Volume 5, Sterne parodies the genre of &quot;consolatio&quot;, mixing and reworking passages from three &quot;widely separated sections&quot; of Burton&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy&quot;, including a parody of Burton&#x27;s &quot;grave and sober account&quot; of Cicero&#x27;s grief for the death of his daughter Tullia.

===Other techniques and influences===
His text is filled with allusions and references to the leading thinkers and writers of the 17th and 18th centuries. Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift were major influences on Sterne and &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;. Satires of Pope and Swift formed much of the humour of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, but Swift&#x27;s sermons and Locke&#x27;s &quot;Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; also contributed ideas and frameworks Sterne explored throughout the novel. Other major influences are Cervantes and Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot;, as well as the significant inter-textual debt to &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;, Swift&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Books&quot;, and the Scriblerian collaborative work &quot;The Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus&quot;.

The shade of Cervantes is present throughout Sterne&#x27;s novel. The frequent references to Rocinante, the character of Uncle Toby (who resembles Don Quixote in many ways) and Sterne&#x27;s own description of his characters&#x27; &quot;Cervantic humour&quot;, along with the genre-defying structure of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, which owes much to the second part of Cervantes&#x27; novel, all demonstrate the influence of Cervantes.

The novel also makes use of John Locke&#x27;s theories of empiricism, or the way we assemble what we know of ourselves and our world from the &quot;association of ideas&quot; that come to us from our five senses. Sterne is by turns respectful and satirical of Locke&#x27;s theories, using the association of ideas to construct characters&#x27; &quot;hobby-horses&quot;, or whimsical obsessions, that both order and disorder their lives in different ways. Sterne borrows from and argues against Locke&#x27;s language theories (on the imprecision and arbitrariness of words and usage), and consequently spends much time discussing the very words he uses in his own narrative—with &quot;digressions, gestures, piling up of apparent trivia in the effort to get at the truth&quot;.

There is a significant body of critical opinion that argues that &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; is better understood as an example of an obsolescent literary tradition of &quot;Learned Wit&quot;, partly following the contribution of D. W. Jefferson.

==Reception and influence==
Some of Sterne&#x27;s contemporaries did not hold the novel in high esteem, but its bawdy humour was popular with London society. Through time, it has come to be seen as one of the greatest comic novels in English. Arthur Schopenhauer called &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; one of &quot;the four immortal romances&quot; and Ludwig Wittgenstein considered it &quot;one of my favourite books&quot;.

Samuel Johnson in 1776 commented, &quot;Nothing odd will do long. &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; did not last.&quot; Schopenhauer privately rebutted Samuel Johnson, saying: &quot;The man Sterne is worth 1,000 Pedants and commonplace-fellows like Dr. J.&quot; George Washington enjoyed the book. The young Karl Marx was a devotee of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, and wrote a still-unpublished short humorous novel, &quot;Scorpion and Felix&quot;, that was obviously influenced by Sterne&#x27;s work. Goethe praised Sterne in &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Journeyman Years&quot;, which in turn influenced Nietzsche. Writing in &quot;The Times&quot; in January 2021, critic Michael Henderson disparaged the novel, stating that it &quot;honks like John Coltrane, and is not nearly so funny.&quot;

&quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; has also been seen by formalists and other literary critics as a forerunner of many narrative devices and styles used by modernist and postmodernist authors such as James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Carlos Fuentes, Milan Kundera and Salman Rushdie. The critic James Wood identified the novel as a precursor to the &quot;hysterical realism&quot; of authors such as Rushdie and Thomas Pynchon. Novelist Javier Marías cites &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; as the book that changed his life when he translated it into Spanish at 25, claiming that from it he &quot;learned almost everything about novel writing, and that a novel may contain anything and still be a novel.&quot;

The success of Sterne&#x27;s novel got him an appointment by Lord Fauconberg as curate of St Michael&#x27;s Church in Coxwold, North Yorkshire, which included living at Sterne&#x27;s model for Shandy Hall. The medieval structure still stands today, and is under the care of the Laurence Sterne Trust since its acquisition in the 1960s. The gardens, which Sterne tended during his time there, are daily open to visitors.

The novel&#x27;s success has resulted in permanent additions to the English lexicon; within the text of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; Sterne describes the novel as &quot;Shandean&quot;, coining a term which still carries the meaning that Sterne originally attached to it when he wrote, &quot;I write a careless kind of a civil, nonsensical, good humoured &quot;Shandean&quot; book...&quot; Strongly influenced by Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, Sterne&#x27;s &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; also gave rise to the term &quot;cervantic&quot; (which Sterne at the time spelled &quot;cervantick&quot;).

===Abolitionists===
In 1766, at the height of the debate about slavery in Britain, Ignatius Sancho wrote a letter to Sterne encouraging the writer to use his pen to lobby for the abolition of the slave trade. &quot;That subject, handled in your striking manner, would ease the yoke (perhaps) of many—but if only one—Gracious God!—what a feast to a benevolent heart!&quot; he wrote.

In July 1766 Sancho&#x27;s letter was received by Sterne shortly after he had just finished writing a conversation between his fictional characters Corporal Trim and his brother Tom in &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, in which Tom described the oppression of a black servant in a sausage shop in Lisbon, which he had visited. This &quot;tender tale&quot; was published in Chapter 65 (Vol. IV) of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;. Sterne&#x27;s widely publicised 27 July 1766 response to Sancho&#x27;s letter became an integral part of 18th-century abolitionist literature.

==Adaptations==
In 2005, BBC Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation by Graham White in ten 15-minute episodes directed by Mary Peate, with Neil Dudgeon as Tristram, Julia Ford as Mother, David Troughton as Father, Adrian Scarborough as Toby, Paul Ritter as Trim, Tony Rohr as Dr Slop, Stephen Hogan as Obadiah, Helen Longworth as Susannah, Ndidi Del Fatti as Great-Grandmother, Stuart McLoughlin as Great-Grandfather/Pontificating Man and Hugh Dickson as Bishop Hall.

&quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; has been adapted as a graphic novel by cartoonist Martin Rowson.
Michael Nyman has worked sporadically on &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; as an opera since 1981. At least five portions of the opera have been publicly performed and one, &quot;Nose-List Song&quot;, was recorded in 1985 on the album &quot;The Kiss and Other Movements&quot;.

The book was adapted on film in 2006 as &quot;A Cock and Bull Story&quot;, directed by Michael Winterbottom, written by Frank Cottrell Boyce (credited as Martin Hardy, in a complicated metafictional twist), and starring Steve Coogan, Rob Brydon, Keeley Hawes, Kelly Macdonald, Naomie Harris, and Gillian Anderson. The movie plays with metatextual levels, showing both scenes from the novel itself and fictionalised behind-the-scenes footage of the adaptation process, even employing some of the actors to play themselves.

In February 2014, a theatrical adaptation by Callum Hale was presented at the Tabard Theatre in Chiswick.

&quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; has been translated into many languages, including German (repeatedly, beginning in 1769), Dutch (repeatedly, by Munnikhuisen, 1779; Lindo, 1852 and Jan &amp; Gertrude Starink, 1990), French (repeatedly, beginning in 1785; by Guy Jouvet, 2004), Russian (repeatedly, beginning 1804–1807; by Adrian Antonovich Frankovsky, 1949), Hungarian (by Győző Határ, 1956), Italian (by Antonio Meo, 1958), Czech (by Aloys Skoumal, 1963), Slovene (by Janez Gradišnik, 1968), Spanish (by José Antonio López de Letona, 1975; Ana María Aznar, 1976 and Javier Marías, 1978), Portuguese (by José Paulo Paes, 1984), Catalan (by Joaquim Mallafré, 1993), Norwegian (by Bjørn Herrman, 1995–96), Finnish (by Kersti Juva, 1998).

&quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; was adapted by Martin Pearlman in 2018 as a comic chamber opera, &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy&quot;.

==References to &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;==
Well known in philosophy and mathematics, the so-called &quot;paradox of Tristram Shandy&quot; was introduced by Bertrand Russell in his book &quot;The Principles of Mathematics&quot; to evidentiate the inner contradictions that arise from the assumption that infinite sets can have the same cardinality—as would be the case with a gentleman who spends one year to write the story of one day of his life, if he were able to write for an infinite length of time. The paradox depends upon the fact that &quot;the number of days in all time is no greater than the number of years&quot;. Karl Popper, in contrast, came to the conclusion that Tristram Shandy—by writing his history of life—would never be able to finish this story, because his last act of writing: that he is writing his history of life could never be included in his actual writing.

Heinrich Heine (1796–1856) mentioned the book in his writings. &quot;The author of Tristram Shandy reveals to us the profoundest depths of the human soul; he opens, as it were, a crevice of the soul; permits us to take one glance into its abysses, into its paradise and into its filthiest recesses; then quickly lets the curtain fall over it. We have had a front view of that marvellous theatre, the soul; the arrangements of lights and the perspective have not failed in their effects, and while we imagined that we were gazing upon the infinite, our own hearts have been exalted with a sense of infinity and poetry.&quot;
At the start of his novel &quot;La Peau de chagrin&quot;, Honoré de Balzac includes an image from &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;: a curvy line drawn in the air by a character seeking to express the freedom enjoyed &quot;whilst a man is free&quot;. Balzac never explained his purpose behind the use of the symbol, and its significance to &quot;La Peau de chagrin&quot; is the subject of debate.

A historic site in Geneva, Ohio, called Shandy Hall, is part of the Western Reserve Historical Society. The home was named after the house described in &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;.

In Anthony Trollope&#x27;s novel &quot;Barchester Towers&quot;, the narrator speculates that the scheming clergyman, Mr Slope, is descended from Dr Slop in &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; (the extra letter having been added for the sake of appearances). Slope is also called &quot;Obadiah&quot;, a reference to another character in Sterne&#x27;s novel.

Russian writer Alexander Zhitinsky made multiple references to &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; in his novel &quot;The Flying House, or Conversations with Milord&quot; (the &quot;milord&quot; of the title being Sterne).

In &quot;Surprised by Joy&quot;, C. S. Lewis refers to &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; in the context of trying to describe his interactions with his own father:

(The text of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; uses the phrase &quot;my father&quot; at the head of a paragraph fifty-one times.)

Christopher Morley, editor of &quot;The Saturday Review of Literature&quot;, wrote a preface to the Limited Editions Club issue of Sterne&#x27;s classic. That preface appears in Morley&#x27;s book &quot;Streamlines&quot; published by Doubleday, Doran, in 1932, and is titled &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;.

In the Hermann Hesse novel &quot;Journey to the East&quot;, Tristram Shandy is listed as one of the co-founders of The League.

<doc id="302771" wikidata="Q4797202" url="?curid=302771" title="Art glass">
<text>Art glass is a subset of glass art, this latter covering the whole range of art made from glass. Art glass normally refers only to pieces made since the mid-19th century, and typically to those purely made as sculpture or decorative art, with no main utilitarian function, such as serving as a drinking vessel, though of course stained glass keeps the weather out, and bowls may still be useful.

The term is most used of American glass, where the style is &quot;the logical outcome of the American demand for novelty during the 19th century and was characterized by elaborate form and exotic finish&quot;, but not always the highest quality of execution. There was a great interest in complex colour effects and painted enamelled glass. For art historians the &quot;art glass&quot; phase replaced the &quot;Brilliant Period&quot; of High-Victorian heavy decoration, and was in turn was replaced around 1900 by Art Nouveau glass, but the term may still be used for marketing purposes to refer to contemporary products. In fact the &quot;Brilliant Period&quot; style, which relied on deeply cut glass, continued to be made until about 1915, and sometimes thereafter.

Glass is sometimes combined with other materials. Techniques include glass that has been placed into a kiln so that it will mould into a shape, glassblowing, sandblasted glass, copper-foil glasswork, painted and engraved glass. In general the term is restricted to relatively modern pieces made by people who see themselves as artists who have chosen to work in the medium of glass and both design and make their own pieces as fine art, rather than traditional glassworker craftsmen, who often produce pieces designed by others, though their pieces certainly may form part of art. Studio glass is another term often used for modern glass made for artistic purposes. Art glass has grown in popularity in recent years with many artists becoming famous for their work; and, as a result, more colleges are offering courses in glass work.

During the early 20th-century art glass was generally made by teams of factory workers, taking glass from furnaces containing a thousand or more pounds. This form of art glass, of which Tiffany and Steuben in the U.S., Gallé in France and Hoya Crystal in Japan, Royal Leerdam Crystal in the Netherlands and Orrefors and Kosta Boda in Sweden are perhaps the best known, grew out of the factory system in which all glass objects were hand or mould blown by teams.
Most antique art glass was made in factories, particularly in the UK, the United States, and Bohemia, where items were made to a standard, or &quot;pattern&quot;. This would seem contrary to the idea that art glass is distinctive and shows individual skill. However, the importance of decoration – in the Victorian era in particular – meant that much of the artistry lay with the decorator. Any assumption today that factory-made items were necessarily made by machine is incorrect. Up to about 1940, most of the processes involved in making decorative art glass were performed by hand.

== Factory differentiation and distinctiveness ==

Manufacturers got around the problem of an inherent similarity in their products in various ways. First, they would frequently change designs according to demand. This was especially so in the export-dependent factories of Bohemia where salesmen would report sales trends back to the factory during each trip. Second, the decoration for mid- and lower-market items, often done by contracted &quot;piece&quot; workers, was often a variation on a theme. Such was the skill of these subcontractors that a reasonable standard of quality and a high rate of output were generally maintained. Finally, a high degree of differentiation could be gained from the multiplication of shapes, colours, and decorative designs, yielding many different combinations. Concurrently, from the same factories came distinctive, artistic items produced in more limited quantities for the upper-market consumer. These were decorated in-house where decorators could work closely with designers and management in order to produce a piece that was profitable.

=== Usable art glass ===
Many items that are now considered art glass were originally intended for use. Often that use has ceased to be relevant, but even if not, in the Victorian era and for some decades beyond useful items were often decorated to such a high degree that they are now appreciated for their artistic or design merits.

Some art glass retains its original purpose but has come to be appreciated more for its art than for its use. Collectors of antique perfume bottles, for example, tend to display their items empty. As items of packaging, these bottles would originally have been used and thus would not ordinarily have been considered art glass. However, because of fashion trends, then as now, producers supplied goods in beautiful packaging. Lalique&#x27;s Art Nouveau glass and Art Deco designs by Josef Hoffmann among others have come to be considered art glass due to their stylish and highly original decorative designs.

== Moulded art glass ==
There has been a growing recognition that moulded, mass-produced glass with little or no decoration but high artistic and fabrication quality such as that produced by Lalique should be considered art glass.

== Decorating techniques ==

*Colour: Various colours inter-mixed or otherwise incorporated
*Texture: Frosting, satinizing, glue-chip, overshot and sandblasting
*Surfaces: Overlays, cameo, cut-back, cutting and engraving

== Refined glassware ==

Up-market refined glassware, usually lead crystal, is highly decorated and is revered for its high quality of workmanship, the purity of the metal (molten glass mixture), and the decorative techniques used, most often cutting and gilding. Both techniques continue to be used in the decoration of many pieces made from lead crystal, and nowadays these pieces are regarded as art glass.

=== Cut glass ===
Cut glass is most often produced by hand, but automation is now becoming more common. Some designs show artistic flair, but most tend to be regular, geometric, and repetitious. Occasionally, the design can be considered a &quot;pattern&quot; to be replicated as exactly as possible, with the main purpose being to accentuate the refractive qualities, or &quot;sparkle&quot;, of the crystal.

=== Art cut ===
A clear exception could be made for the highly distinctive cut crystal designs which were produced in limited quantities by designers of note. Examples are the designs of Keith Murray for Steven &amp; Williams and those of Clyne Farquharson for John Walsh Walsh. A relatively new term is coming into use for this genre: &quot;Art Cut&quot;.

<text>Float glass is a sheet of glass made by floating molten glass on a bed of molten metal of a low melting point, typically tin, although lead was used for the process in the past. This method gives the sheet uniform thickness and a very flat surface. The float glass process is also known as the Pilkington process, named after the British glass manufacturer Pilkington, which pioneered the technique in the 1950s at their production site in St Helens, Merseyside.

Modern windows are usually made from float glass, though Corning Incorporated uses the overflow downdraw method. 

Most float glass is soda–lime glass, although relatively minor quantities of specialty borosilicate and flat panel display glass are also produced using the float glass process.

== History ==

Until the 16th century, window glass or other flat glass was generally cut from large discs (or rondels) of crown glass. Larger sheets of glass were made by blowing large cylinders which were cut open and flattened, then cut into panes. Most window glass in the early 19th century was made using the cylinder method. The &#x27;cylinders&#x27; were long and in diameter, limiting the width that panes of glass could be cut, and resulting in windows divided by transoms into rectangular panels.

The first advances in automating glass manufacturing were patented in 1848 by Henry Bessemer. His system produced a continuous ribbon of flat glass by forming the ribbon between rollers. This was an expensive process, as the surfaces of the glass needed polishing. If the glass could be set on a perfectly smooth, flat body, like the surface of an open pan of calm liquid, this would reduce costs considerably. Attempts were made, including by Bessemer, to form flat glass on a bath of molten tin—one of the few liquids denser than glass that would be calm at the high temperatures needed to make glass—most notably in the US. Several patents were granted, but this process was unworkable at the time.

Before the development of float glass, larger sheets of plate glass were made by casting a large puddle of glass on an iron surface, and then polishing both sides, a costly process. From the early 1920s, a continuous ribbon of plate glass was passed through a lengthy series of inline grinders and polishers, reducing glass losses and cost.

Glass of lower quality, drawn glass, was made by drawing upwards from a pool of molten glass a thin sheet, held at the edges by rollers. As it cooled the rising sheet stiffened and could then be cut. The two surfaces were of lower quality i.e. not as smooth or uniform as those of float glass. This process continued in use for many years after the development of float glass.

Between 1953 and 1957, at the Cowley Hill Works St Helens, Lancashire, Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK&#x27;s Pilkington Brothers developed the first successful commercial application for forming a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity. The success of this process lay in the careful balance of the volume of glass fed onto the bath, where it was flattened by its own weight. Full scale profitable sales of float glass were first achieved in 1960, and in the 1960s the process was licensed throughout the world, replacing previous production methods.

==Manufacture==
Float glass uses common glass-making raw materials, typically consisting of sand, soda ash (sodium carbonate), dolomite, limestone, and salt cake (sodium sulfate) etc. Other materials may be used as colourants, refining agents or to adjust the physical and chemical properties of the glass. The raw materials are mixed in a batch process, then fed together with a controlled proportion of cullet (waste glass) into a furnace, where it is heated to approximately 1,500 °C. Common float glass furnaces are 9 m wide and 45 m long and have capacities of more than 1,200 tons of glass. Once molten, the temperature of the glass is stabilised to approximately 1,200 °C to ensure a homogeneous density.

The molten glass is fed into a &quot;tin bath&quot;, a bath of molten tin (about 3–4 m wide, 50 m long, 6 cm deep), from a delivery canal and is poured into the tin bath by a ceramic lip known as the spout lip. The amount of glass allowed to pour onto the molten tin is controlled by a gate called a &quot;tweel&quot;.

Molten tin is suitable for the float glass process because it has a higher density than glass, so the molten glass floats on it. Its boiling point is higher than the melting point of glass, and its vapour pressure at process temperature is low. However, tin oxidises in a natural atmosphere to form tin dioxide (SnO2). Known in the production process as dross, the tin dioxide adheres to the glass. To prevent oxidation, the tin bath is provided with a positive pressure protective atmosphere of nitrogen and hydrogen.

The glass flows onto the tin surface forming a floating ribbon of even thickness with perfectly smooth surfaces on both sides. As the glass flows along the tin bath, the temperature is gradually reduced from 1,100 °C until at approximately 600 °C the sheet can be lifted from the tin onto rollers. The glass ribbon is pulled off the bath by rollers at a controlled speed. Variation in the flow speed and roller speed enables glass sheets of varying thickness to be formed. Top rollers positioned above the molten tin may be used to control both the thickness and the width of the glass ribbon.

Once off the bath, the glass sheet passes through a lehr kiln for approximately 100 m, where it is cooled gradually so that it anneals without strain and does not crack from the temperature change. On exiting the &quot;cold end&quot; of the kiln, the glass is cut by machines.

==Uses==

Today, float glass is the most widely produced form of glass, with a multitude of commercial applications. Due to both its high quality with no additional polishing required and its structural flexibility during production, it can easily be shaped and bent into a variety of forms while in a heated, syrupy state. This makes it ideal for a variety of applications such as

* Automobile glass (e.g. windshields, windows, mirrors)
* Mirrors
* Furniture (e.g. in tables and shelves)
* Insulated glass
* Windows and doors

Most forms of specialized glass such as toughened glass, frosted glass, laminated safety glass and soundproof glass consist of standard float glass that has been further processed.

==Market==
As of 2009, the world float glass market, not including China and Russia, is dominated by four companies: Asahi Glass, NSG/Pilkington, Saint-Gobain, and Guardian Industries. Other companies include Sise Cam AS, Vitro, formerly PPG, Central Glass, Hankuk (HanGlas), Carlex Glass, and Cardinal Glass Industries.

<text>Siddig El Tahir El Fadil El Siddig Abdurrahman Mohammed Ahmed Abdel Karim El Mahdi (born 21 November 1965) is a British actor and director known professionally as Siddig El Fadil and subsequently as Alexander Siddig.

Siddig is best known for his roles as Dr. Julian Bashir in the television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, former terrorist Hamri Al-Assad in the sixth season of the series &quot;24&quot;, Doran Martell in &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul in &quot;Gotham&quot;, and Philip Burton in &quot;Primeval&quot;. He also starred in the films &quot;Syriana&quot; (2005), &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2006), &quot;A Lost Man&quot; (2007), &quot;Cairo Time&quot; (2009), and &quot;Inescapable&quot; (2012).

==Early life and education ==
Siddig El Tahir El Fadil El Siddig Abdurrahman Mohammed Ahmed Abdel Karim El Mahdi was born on 21 November 1965 in Omdurman, Sudan. His father, Tahir El Mahdi, was Sudanese; his mother, Gloria (née Taylor; d. 2001) was English. She was the older sister of actor Malcolm McDowell.

Siddig&#x27;s parents met in the 1960s when his mother travelled to Sudan with a friend, who introduced her to Siddig&#x27;s father. Siddig&#x27;s father was a student at Cambridge University in the 1950s, and was proficient in English. Siddig&#x27;s uncle Sadiq al-Mahdi was prime minister of Sudan from 19661967 and again from 19861989. Siddig is also the great-great-grandson of Muhammad Ahmad, a Nubian religious leader who was proclaimed the Mahdi by his disciples.

Siddig&#x27;s mother remained in Sudan for three years and returned to London with Siddig and his father. Siddig was two years old at the time. Siddig initially spoke Arabic when he was a child, but by his second year of living in Britain, he had forgotten much of it. In 1978, his mother married film director and producer Michael Birkett, and in 1982, the two had a son together named Thomas. Siddig&#x27;s mother worked as a model and theatrical press agent.

Siddig attended St Lawrence College, Ramsgate. He also studied geography and anthropology for a year at University College London before enrolling at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA).

==Career==
After leaving LAMDA, Siddig worked in theatre as both an actor and director. Siddig&#x27;s first television role was a Palestinian man in a British six-part miniseries called &quot;The Big Battalions&quot; (filmed in 1989 but released in 1992), and shortly afterward, he won the role of Prince Feisal in &quot;A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia&quot;, a 1990 telefilm sequel to &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; starring Ralph Fiennes.

Siddig&#x27;s role in &quot;A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia&quot; brought him to the attention of Rick Berman, executive producer of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (1993). Berman originally considered Siddig for the role of Commander Benjamin Sisko, but decided in the end that Siddig was too young for the role and cast him as Dr. Julian Bashir. Siddig remained with &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; for all seven seasons of the series. He also directed the episodes &quot;Business as Usual&quot; (1997) and &quot;Profit and Lace&quot; (1998). In 1995, Siddig also changed his stage name from Siddig El Fadil to Alexander Siddig.

Siddig told &quot;Bidoun&quot; magazine that demand for Islamic and Arabic character roles was increasing in both film and television after the September 11 attacks and that people began to approach him with projects within six months of the event. He played a mountain guide in the thriller film &quot;Vertical Limit&quot; (2000), starring Chris O&#x27;Donnell, and Ajay in the postapocalyptic science-fantasy film &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; (2002) starring Christian Bale. In 2003, Siddig played the role of an Algerian secret agent on the trail of Islamists in the controversial episode &quot;Nest of Angels&quot; of the British television show &quot;Spooks&quot; (known as &quot;MI-5&quot; in the US). Siddig appeared in a cameo role as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed the film &quot;The Hamburg Cell&quot; that premiered the following year.

In 2005, Siddig returned to the live stage, playing the role of Doctor Scott in a production of &quot;Whose Life Is It Anyway?&quot; starring Kim Cattrall that played at the Comedy Theatre in London. That same year, Siddig appeared as Saladin&#x27;s aide Imad in Ridley Scott&#x27;s 2005 film &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot;, and starred alongside George Clooney and Matt Damon as Prince Nasir in the film &quot;Syriana&quot;.

Siddig played the title role in the BBC&#x27;s 2006 telefilm &quot;Hannibal&quot;. In 2007, he starred in &quot;A Lost Man&quot; (French title &quot;Un Homme Perdu&quot;) a French-language film that screened at the Cannes Film Festival. That same year, he played the role of former terrorist Hamri Al-Assad in the sixth season of &quot;24&quot;.

In 2009, he co-starred with Patricia Clarkson in the award-winning film &quot;Cairo Time&quot; as Tareq Khalifa, an Egyptian who battles his attraction to his friend&#x27;s wife. Directed by Canadian director Ruba Nadda, the film won the prize for &quot;Best Canadian Feature Film&quot; at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. He also played Jamal in Julian Schnabel’s 2010 film &quot;Miral&quot;.

Siddig played Philip Burton in series four and five of the ITV science-fiction drama programme &quot;Primeval&quot;; both series aired in 2011. In 2012, Siddig again worked with director Nadda and played the starring role as a Syrian-Canadian businessman in the film &quot;Inescapable&quot;, which also starred Marisa Tomei and Joshua Jackson.

In 2013, Siddig narrated the BBC Two nature documentary series &quot;Wild Arabia&quot; and played the role of Minos in the first series of the BBC fantasy-adventure programme &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

From 2013 to 2015, Siddig played Aslan Al-Rahim (&quot;the Turk&quot;) in the BBC historical fantasy drama series &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Demons&quot;. In 2015 and 2016, he appeared in the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;; Siddig played the role of Doran Martell, the ruling Prince of Dorne, in the series&#x27; fifth and sixth seasons. He also played Reuben Oliver, an artist and suitor of Polly Shelby, in the third season of the British series &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;. Siddig also provided the voice of Wolf, a character in the historical fantasy drama &quot;Tumanbay&quot; that aired on BBC Radio 4 between December 2015 and February 2016.

In 2017, Siddig joined the cast of the televisions series &quot;Gotham&quot; as League of Shadows leader Ra’s al Ghul and also played the part of Aristotle Onassis in the drama miniseries &quot;The Kennedys: After Camelot&quot;.

In 2019, he appeared in the Netflix series &quot;The Spy&quot; as Ahmed Suidani, a Syrian security officer. That same year, he appeared as Issouf Al Moctar in the second season of the Fox (UK and Ireland) thriller series &quot;Deep State&quot;, and voiced Avi Singh in &quot;Star Wars: The Bad Batch&quot;.

==Personal life==
Siddig began a relationship with Nana Visitor whilst working on the set of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. Their son, Django El Tahir El Siddig, was born on 16 September 1996 and Visitor&#x27;s pregnancy was written into the storyline of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. Django is Siddig&#x27;s first child and Visitor&#x27;s second son. The couple married in 1997 and divorced in 2001.

In an April 2024 interview, Siddig described his sexuality as &quot;not quite straight&quot;.

<doc id="302784" wikidata="Q7611689" url="?curid=302784" title="Steuben Glass Works">
<text>Steuben Glass is an American art glass manufacturer, founded in the summer of 1903 by Frederick Carder and Thomas G. Hawkes in Corning, New York, which is in Steuben County, from which the company name was derived. Hawkes was the owner of the largest cut glass firm then operating in Corning. Carder was an Englishman (born September 18, 1863) who had many years&#x27; experience designing glass for Stevens &amp; Williams in England. Hawkes purchased the glass blanks for his cutting shop from many sources and eventually wanted to start a factory to make the blanks himself. Hawkes convinced Carder to come to Corning and manage such a factory. Carder, who had been passed over for promotion at Stevens and Williams, consented to do so.

In 1918, Steuben was acquired by Corning Glass Works and became the Steuben Division.

In July 2008, Steuben was sold by Corning Incorporated for an undisclosed price to Schottenstein Stores, which also owns 51% of Retail Ventures, a holding company for DSW, Filene&#x27;s Basement, and formerly Value City Department Stores; Value City Furniture, which changed its name to American Signature Furniture; 15% of American Eagle Outfitters, retail liquidator SB Capital Group, some 50 shopping centers, and 5 factories producing its shoes, furniture and crystal.

On September 15, 2011, Schottenstein announced it was shutting down Steuben&#x27;s Corning factory and Manhattan store, ending the company&#x27;s 108-year history. Soon after, Corning Incorporated repurchased the Steuben brand. In early 2014, The Corning Museum of Glass announced that it would work with independent contractors to reproduce Steuben using a new, lead-free formula and their classic leaded crystal.

==Carder period (1903–1932)==
Steuben Glass Works started operation in October 1903. Carder produced blanks for Hawkes and also began producing cut glass himself. Carder&#x27;s great love was colored glass and had been instrumental in the reintroduction of colored glass while at Stevens and Williams. When Steuben&#x27;s success at producing blanks for Hawkes became assured, Carder began to experiment with colored glass and continued experiments that were started in England. He soon perfected Gold Aurene which was similar to iridescent art glass that was being produced by Tiffany and others. Gold Aurene was followed by a wide range of colored art glass that eventually was produced in more than 7,000 shapes and 140 colors.
Steuben Glass Works continued to produce glass of all sorts until World War I. At that time war time restrictions made it impossible for Steuben to acquire the materials needed to continue manufacture. The company was subsequently sold to Corning Glass Works and became the Steuben Division. Carder continued as Division manager without any real change in the company&#x27;s operation except that he now had reporting responsibilities to Corning Glass Works&#x27; management. Corning&#x27;s management tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to limit the articles that Steuben made to only the most popular. Production continued until about 1932.

In 1932, there was a major change in Steuben management. The nationwide depression had limited the sale of Steuben and there was a lessening of public interest in colored glass. In February 1932, John MacKay was appointed to Carder&#x27;s position. Carder became Art Director for Corning Glass Works. Steuben then produced primarily colorless art glass.

Steuben still produced colored art glass, but mostly to fill special orders. A few new colors were added after Carder transitioned into his new role with Corning Glass Works, but the last known sale for colored art glass by Steuben was in 1943.

==Houghton period (1933–2012)==

Corning Glass Works appointed Arthur A. Houghton Jr. as President in 1933, and under his leadership Steuben changed artistic direction toward more modern forms. Using a newly formulated clear glass developed by Corning (referred to as 10M) which had a very high refraction index, Steuben designers developed beautiful, fluid designs. Pieces such as Gazelle Bowl, designed by Sidney Waugh incorporated Art Deco and modernist themes into glass.

The themes during this period included &quot;balustrade&quot; designs for water goblets and candlesticks, footed bowls and serving pieces. Decorative forms included wildlife pieces representing owls, penguins and other birds in smooth stylistic forms. Some pieces, such as the Ram&#x27;s Head Candy Dish, playfully included clean lines crowned by an ornate design (a ram&#x27;s head, complete with a ruff) on the lid as an homage to its classic earlier pieces.

The company also entered into the field of larger show and presentation pieces celebrating various scenes (such as its cut-away design featuring an Eskimo ice fisherman above the ice, and the fish below, or the Cathedral Window design) and elements that incorporated etchings. In some cases sterling silver or gold plating were used on metal finish elements such as the golden &quot;fly&quot; atop the nose of a rainbow trout. Each piece is signed simply with &quot;Steuben&quot; on the underside of the object.

Toward the 1990s, the company also began production of small objects—&quot;hand coolers&quot;—in various animal shapes.

Items from this period were also noted for their careful and elegant packaging. Before boxing, each Steuben piece was placed in a silver-gray flannel bag (stitched with the Steuben name), and then placed in a presentation box.

<doc id="302789" wikidata="Q7887768" url="?curid=302789" title="Vic Fontaine">
<text>Vic Fontaine is a fictional character who appeared in the sixth and seventh seasons of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. Portrayed by James Darren, he is a holographic representation of a 1960s-era Las Vegas Rat Pack–style singer and entertainer, as part of a program run in the holosuites at Quark&#x27;s bar. The character was developed from an idea by executive producer Ira Steven Behr, who had sought to introduce a character of that type during the fourth season to be played by Frank Sinatra, Jr. After Sinatra turned down the role, it was considered during the following season, to be played by Steve Lawrence, but once again was not used. Darren landed the role after Behr met him at a memorabilia show in North Hollywood and had him invited to audition.

The character made his first appearance in the episode &quot;His Way&quot;, and returned later in the sixth season in &quot;Tears of the Prophets&quot; and throughout the seventh season. Fontaine represented a source of romantic advice for the crew, helping to get Odo (René Auberjonois) and Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) together as well as aiding Quark (Armin Shimerman) and Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) to move on from their love of Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell). He also helps Nog (Aron Eisenberg) to recover from the loss of his leg in &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Paper Moon&quot;. Returning the favor in &quot;Badda-Bing Badda-Bang&quot;, the crew help Fontaine get his bar back after it is taken over by the American Mafia. The crew return to the bar one final time in the series finale, &quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;, for the celebration party following the victory over the Dominion.

Episodes such as &quot;His Way&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Paper Moon&quot; were praised, and &quot;Badda-Bing Badda-Bang&quot; was compared to the famed 1960&#x27;s &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot;. The character itself was praised by critics, who specifically said that the premise should not have worked but did, due to both the writing and Darren&#x27;s performances.

==Concept and development==
Executive producer Ira Steven Behr had long sought to introduce a Rat Pack-style character to &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; since the fourth season, as he was a lifelong fan of 1960s-era Las Vegas and the music of that period. The initial idea was that the character would be someone who could give out romantic advice, and that it would not appear in every episode but only as and when it was needed. In preparation, Behr and Robert Hewitt Wolfe wrote a scene in order to flesh out the character, while Behr immediately had a performer in mind to play the new character: Frank Sinatra Jr., a known fan of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Casting director Ron Surma got in touch with Sinatra, who thought that it would be a funny idea. Sinatra wanted to play an alien and not the singer character they had in mind, so the idea was shelved for the time being.

During the production of the fifth season episode &quot;A Simple Investigation&quot;, it was decided to insert the scene that Behr and Wolfe had previously created. Behr mused at the time that while Sinatra might not want to portray the character, perhaps someone similar to Steve Lawrence would. Behr named the character Vic Fontaine, a combination of two names he had been planning to use for some time. Some time later, Behr noticed a similarity in naming between the new character and one from the 1972 film &quot;The Godfather&quot;. But Lawrence was unavailable and the scene proved too long to be included in the episode, so once again the idea was put on hold. Behr was unsure how to write the character into the show until it became apparent that it could be included as part of the relationship between Odo and Kira Nerys in the episode &quot;Children of Time&quot;. Rather than film an individual scene, he decided that an entire 1960s-era Las Vegas themed episode should be created, resulting in the production of &quot;His Way&quot;.

===&quot;His Way&quot;===

Several people were interviewed for the part, including Tom Jones, Robert Goulet, and Jerry Vale. Meanwhile, Behr and a friend attended a memorabilia show at the Beverly Garland Hotel in North Hollywood, where James Darren was signing autographs. Darren had not wanted to attend the event, but had been convinced otherwise. Behr thought he was so charming that he wanted to talk to him about the role on the spot, but his friend talked him out of it as he was worried that Darren would think he was insane. Surma got in touch with Darren at Behr&#x27;s prompting. Darren initially rejected the role three times, thinking that a real singer playing a role as a singer, is too &quot;on the nose&quot;. Darren&#x27;s agent eventually convinced him to actually read the script. He loved playing the character while reading it ten times to absorb the personality enough to avoid having to memorize lines. He later called it a &quot;dream come true&quot;.

Darren came in for casting and began talking about knowing where to source the appropriate tuxedos, and that he could wear a pair of Dean Martin&#x27;s shoes that he owned. During the course of the meeting, Behr became convinced that Darren was already performing the Fontaine piece, having moved into it seamlessly in conversation. Darren had deliberately avoided simply reading the script at rehearsal, as he disliked doing cold reads; instead, he was intentionally improvising lines that he thought that the character would say. Yet he did so in a way that he recalls prompting Behr to say, &quot;Man, it&#x27;s funny, I wrote a line just like that for Vic.&quot; After Darren left, Behr excitedly told the other writers how good he was, but that perhaps they should still see other actors. Producer Hans Beimler replied, &quot;Are you out of your mind? What are you talking about? Vic Fontaine was just in the room. There&#x27;s no question, there&#x27;s no question! He&#x27;s the guy!&quot;

Darren was subsequently hired for the role. He thought that Fontaine was a combination of Martin and Frank Sinatra, and found that a mention by the character to traveling with that duo to Vegas in the &quot;His Way&quot; script caused him to think about the past, as he had travelled with Sinatra, Jr. and Nancy Sinatra in Sinatra&#x27;s private plane to Las Vegas to see Sinatra and Martin play at the Sands Hotel and Casino on several occasions. At the time, Darren was unsure whether it was to be a recurring role or not, but had enjoyed the experience. Fontaine is in the final episode of the season, &quot;Tears of the Prophets&quot;, and several episodes throughout season seven.

==Appearances==
Vic Fontaine is first introduced in the episode &quot;His Way&quot; as a romantically insightful hologram who, uniquely for holodeck characters, is &quot;aware&quot; that he&#x27;s a hologram. He forms part of a new Rat Pack-style Las Vegas bar program owned by Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig). Several of the main crew are present for his performance of &quot;You&#x27;re Nobody till Somebody Loves You&quot;. Afterwards, Odo (René Auberjonois) seeks some advice in private from Fontaine about his feelings for Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor). The hologram helps Odo practice with another hologram that looks like Kira but does not act correctly, but Odo finds that when the real version returns to the station that they can barely interact. Fontaine transfers himself into Kira&#x27;s meditation holo-program and invites her to dinner; curious, she accepts. Fontaine invites Odo back to his program, saying that the holo-Kira now acts exactly like her. The two get together in the holodeck and the date goes well until Odo reveals that he thinks that the real Kira is actually a hologram. The ruse revealed, both look accusingly at Fontaine and leave. But once outside on the promenade, the duo begin to argue, resulting in Odo kissing Kira.

During the second appearance of the character in &quot;Tears of the Prophets&quot;, Bashir and Quark (Armin Shimerman) run Fontaine&#x27;s program in an attempt to cheer themselves up after realising that they will never have a chance with Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) because of her relationship with Worf (Michael Dorn). The hologram advises them to move on with their lives. In the first episode of the seventh season, &quot;Image in the Sand&quot;, Worf is mourning the death of Jadzia. He goes to Fontaine and asks him to sing the Frank Sinatra song &quot;All the Way&quot;. Fontaine sings the song reluctantly, and partway through, Worf begins to destroy the bar in his grief-stricken rage. At the start of &quot;The Siege of AR-558&quot;, Fontaine auditions Rom (Max Grodénchik) as a new lounge singer. He does not get the job. Later, while the Federation troops are under siege by the Jem&#x27;Hadar, Bashir plays Fontaine&#x27;s recording of &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You&quot; over a sound system to raise morale. As a result of him losing his leg during the siege, in &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Paper Moon&quot;, Nog (Aron Eisenberg) keeps playing that song in private upon his return to &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. He goes to the holosuite to play the Fontaine program, and begins to rely on it, effectively moving into the holosuite permanently.

Ezri Dax (Nicole de Boer), the station&#x27;s counselor, has concerns with Nog living in a fictional world and speaks to Fontaine, who explains that he has a plan to rectify the situation. Fontaine convinces Nog that the bar is in trouble and he needs some help with the accounts; the Ferengi uses his business knowledge to help the hologram. Fontaine befriends Nog and after a while tries to convince him to return to the outside world following prompting by Ezri. Nog refuses to leave, resulting in Fontaine shutting down his program and refusing to let it restart. Fontaine appears to Nog in an otherwise empty holosuite, and Nog confesses that his injury has made him fear death and the ongoing war with the Dominion. Fontaine counsels Nog, who feels strong enough to leave the holosuite and return to duty. Shortly after he resumes his role back on the station, Nog returns to Fontaine to inform him that he has convinced Quark to leave the program running continuously to allow Vic to have a life of his own.

A possible Mirror Universe version of Vic Fontaine appears in &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Cloak&quot;. This version of Fontaine appears to be human (no explanation for this is given), and is shot dead during a phaser battle.

In &quot;Badda-Bing Badda-Bang&quot;, as part of a story programmed into the &quot;Vic Fontaine&quot; holodeck setting, Fontaine is forced out of his club by the American Mafia, who turn it into a casino. The rest of the crew want Fontaine&#x27;s bar back the way it was, and are faced with either resetting the program and losing the hologram&#x27;s memory of the crew, or playing along with the story and returning the bar to Vic. So Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) leads a team to steal the casino&#x27;s takings. Upon their success, the program restores the bar to the way it was, and Fontaine celebrates by singing &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come&quot; to the crew. During the finale of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;, Quark passes the time during the attack on Cardassia Prime by playing Go Fish with Fontaine. Later, after the victory and the defeat of the Dominion, the crew return to Vic&#x27;s bar for a celebratory party.

==Reception==
The character of Vic Fontaine was received with mixed reviews by both critics and the public. While Keith DeCandido disliked the idea of the Fontaine program in his review of &quot;His Way&quot; for Tor.com, saying that &quot;It&#x27;s silly, it&#x27;s frivolous, it raises all kinds of ethical conundrums that the show never shows the remotest interest in investigating&quot;, he said that he enjoyed Darren&#x27;s performance, which caused him to smile every time Darren spoke. Zack Handlen praised the 1960s scenes in &quot;His Way&quot; for The A.V. Club, saying that it &quot;isn&#x27;t as entirely ridiculous as it sounds, and the fact that it works even remotely is a testament to the actors and the script&quot;.

Charlie Jane Anders described Fontaine as a &quot;less cool Guinan&quot; in her criticism of &quot;Badda-Bing Badda-Bang&quot;. The episode was included in her list of the worst holodeck-related episodes of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, but added that she was a fan of &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Paper Moon&quot;. That episode was ranked as the third best of the series by Gem Wheeler for &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, who called Fontaine the &quot;ideal holographic host&quot; on the show. The character was named the sixth best thing about &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; in a list of highlights by &quot;TrekToday&quot; in 2015.

In 2020, &quot;ScreenRant&quot; ranked Vic Fontaine as the best holodeck character of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

<doc id="302790" wikidata="Q1706914" url="?curid=302790" title="Ring laser gyroscope">
<text>A ring laser gyroscope (RLG) consists of a ring laser having two independent counter-propagating resonant modes over the same path; the difference in phase is used to detect rotation. It operates on the principle of the Sagnac effect which shifts the nulls of the internal standing wave pattern in response to angular rotation. Interference between the counter-propagating beams, observed externally, results in motion of the standing wave pattern, and thus indicates rotation.

==Description==
The first experimental ring laser gyroscope was demonstrated in the US by Macek and Davis in 1963. Various organizations worldwide subsequently developed ring-laser technology further. Many tens of thousands of RLGs are operating in inertial navigation systems and have established high accuracy, with better than 0.01°/hour bias uncertainty, and mean time between failures in excess of 60,000 hours.

Ring laser gyroscopes can be used as the stable elements (for one degree of freedom each) in an inertial reference system. The advantage of using an RLG is that there are no moving parts (apart from the dither motor assembly (see further description below), and laser-lock), compared to the conventional spinning gyroscope. This means there is no friction, which eliminates a significant source of drift. Additionally, the entire unit is compact, lightweight and highly durable, making it suitable for use in mobile systems such as aircraft, missiles, and satellites. Unlike a mechanical gyroscope, the device does not resist changes to its orientation.

Contemporary applications of the ring laser gyroscope include an embedded GPS capability to further enhance accuracy of RLG inertial navigation systems on military aircraft, commercial airliners, ships, and spacecraft. These hybrid INS/GPS units have replaced their mechanical counterparts in most applications. 

&quot;Ring laser gyroscopes (RLG) have demonstrated to currently be the most sensitive device for testing rotational motion with respect to an inertial frame.&quot;

==Principle of operation==
According to the Sagnac effect, rotation induces a small difference between the time it takes light to traverse the ring in the two directions. This introduces a tiny separation between the frequencies of the counter-propagating beams, a motion of the standing wave pattern within the ring, and thus a beat pattern when those two beams interfere outside the ring. Therefore, the net shift of that interference pattern follows the rotation of the unit in the plane of the ring.

RLGs, while more accurate than mechanical gyroscopes, suffer from an effect known as &quot;lock-in&quot; at very slow rotation rates. When the ring laser is hardly rotating, the frequencies of the counter-propagating laser modes become almost identical. In this case, crosstalk between the counter-propagating beams can allow for injection locking, so that the standing wave &quot;gets stuck&quot; in a preferred phase, thus locking the frequency of each beam to that of the other, rather than responding to gradual rotation.

Forced dithering can largely overcome this problem. The ring laser cavity is rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise about its axis using a mechanical spring driven at its resonance frequency. This ensures that the angular velocity of the system is usually far from the lock-in threshold. Typical rates are 400 Hz, with a peak dither velocity on the order of 1 degree per second. Dither does not fix the lock-in problem completely, as each time the direction of rotation is reversed, a short time interval exists in which the rotation rate is near zero and lock-in briefly can occur. If a pure frequency oscillation is maintained, these small lock-in intervals can accumulate. This was remedied by introducing noise to the 400 Hz vibration.

A different approach to avoiding lock-in is embodied in the Multioscillator Ring Laser Gyroscope, wherein what is effectively two independent ring lasers (each having two counterpropagating beams) of opposite circular polarization coexist in the same ring resonator. The resonator incorporates polarization rotation (via a nonplanar geometry) which splits the fourfold-degenerate cavity mode (two directions, two polarizations each) into right- and left-circular-polarized modes separated by many hundreds of MHz, each having two counterpropagating beams. Nonreciprocal bias via the Faraday effect, either in a special thin Faraday rotator, or via a longitudinal magnetic field on the gain medium, then further splits each circular polarization by typically a few hundred kHz, thus causing each ring laser to have a static output beat frequency of hundreds of kHz. One frequency increases and one decreases, when inertial rotation is present; the two frequencies are measured and then digitally subtracted to finally yield the net Sagnac-effect frequency splitting and thus determine the rotation rate. The Faraday bias frequency is chosen to be higher than any anticipated rotation-induced frequency difference, so the two counterpropagating waves have no opportunity to lock-in.

==Fibre optic gyroscope==
A related device is the fibre optic gyroscope which also operates on the basis of the Sagnac effect, but in which the ring is not a part of the laser. Rather, an external laser injects counter-propagating beams into an optical fiber ring, where rotation causes a relative phase shift between those beams when interfered after their pass through the fiber ring. The phase shift is proportional to the rate of rotation. This is less sensitive in a single traverse of the ring than the RLG, in which the externally observed phase shift is proportional to the accumulated rotation itself, not its derivative. However, the sensitivity of the fiber optic gyro is enhanced by having a long optical fiber, coiled for compactness, in which the Sagnac effect is multiplied according to the number of turns.

<text>Depth perception is the ability to perceive distance to objects in the world using the visual system and visual perception. It is a major factor in perceiving the world in three dimensions.

Depth sensation is the corresponding term for non-human animals, since although it is known that they can sense the distance of an object, it is not known whether they perceive it in the same way that humans do.

Depth perception arises from a variety of depth cues. These are typically classified into binocular cues and monocular cues. Binocular cues are based on the receipt of sensory information in three dimensions from both eyes and monocular cues can be observed with just one eye. Binocular cues include retinal disparity, which exploits parallax and vergence. Stereopsis is made possible with binocular vision. Monocular cues include relative size (distant objects subtend smaller visual angles than near objects), texture gradient, occlusion, linear perspective, contrast differences, and motion parallax.

== Monocular cues ==

Monocular cues provide depth information even when viewing a scene with only one eye.

=== Motion parallax ===

When an observer moves, the apparent relative motion of several stationary objects against a background gives hints about their relative distance. If information about the direction and velocity of movement is known, motion parallax can provide absolute depth information. This effect can be seen clearly when driving in a car. Nearby things pass quickly, while far-off objects appear stationary. Some animals that lack binocular vision due to their eyes having little common field-of-view employ motion parallax more explicitly than humans for depth cueing (for example, some types of birds, which bob their heads to achieve motion parallax, and squirrels, which move in lines orthogonal to an object of interest to do the same).

When an object moves toward the observer, the retinal projection of an object expands over a period of time, which leads to the perception of movement in a line toward the observer. Another name for this phenomenon is &quot;depth from optical expansion&quot;. The dynamic stimulus change enables the observer not only to see the object as moving, but to perceive the distance of the moving object. Thus, in this context, the changing size serves as a distance cue. A related phenomenon is the visual system&#x27;s capacity to calculate time-to-contact (TTC) of an approaching object from the rate of optical expansiona useful ability in contexts ranging from driving a car to playing a ball game. However, the calculation of TTC is, strictly speaking, a perception of velocity rather than depth.

=== Kinetic depth effect ===

If a stationary rigid figure (for example, a wire cube) is placed in front of a point source of light so that its shadow falls on a translucent screen, an observer on the other side of the screen will see a two-dimensional pattern of lines. But if the cube rotates, the visual system will extract the necessary information for perception of the third dimension from the movements of the lines, and a cube is seen. This is an example of the &quot;kinetic depth effect&quot;. The effect also occurs when the rotating object is solid (rather than an outline figure), provided that the projected shadow consists of lines which have definite corners or end points, and that these lines change in both length and orientation during the rotation.

=== Perspective ===

The property of parallel lines converging in the distance, at infinity, allows us to reconstruct the relative distance of two parts of an object, or of landscape features. An example would be standing on a straight road, looking down the road, and noticing the road narrows as it goes off in the distance. Visual perception of perspective in real space, for instance in rooms, in settlements and in nature, is a result of several optical impressions and the interpretation by the visual system. The angle of vision is important for the apparent size. A nearby object is imaged on a larger area on the retina, the same object or an object of the same size further away on a smaller area. The perception of perspective is possible when looking with one eye only, but stereoscopic vision enhances the impression of the spatial. Regardless of whether the light rays entering the eye come from a three-dimensional space or from a two-dimensional image, they hit the inside of the eye on the retina as a surface. What a person sees, is based on the reconstruction by their visual system, in which one and the same image on the retina can be interpreted both two-dimensionally and three-dimensionally. If a three-dimensional interpretation has been recognised, it receives a preference and determines the perception.

In spatial vision, the horizontal line of sight can play a role. In the picture taken from the window of a house, the horizontal line of sight is at the level of the second floor (yellow line). Below this line, the further away objects are, the higher up in the visual field they appear. Above the horizontal line of sight, objects that are further away appear lower than those that are closer. To represent spatial impressions in graphical perspective, one can use a vanishing point. When looking at long geographical distances, perspective effects also partially result from the angle of vision, but not only by this. In picture 5 of the series, in the background is Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in the Alps. It appears lower than the mountain in front in the center of the picture. Measurements and calculations can be used to determine the proportion of the curvature of Earth in the subjectively perceived proportions.

=== Relative size ===

If two objects are known to be the same size (for example, two trees) but their absolute size is unknown, relative size cues can provide information about the relative depth of the two objects. If one subtends a larger visual angle on the retina than the other, the object which subtends the larger visual angle appears closer.

=== Familiar size ===

Since the visual angle of an object projected onto the retina decreases with distance, this information can be combined with previous knowledge of the object&#x27;s size to determine the absolute depth of the object. For example, people are generally familiar with the size of an average automobile. This prior knowledge can be combined with information about the angle it subtends on the retina to determine the absolute depth of an automobile in a scene.

=== Absolute size ===

Even if the actual size of the object is unknown and there is only one object visible, a smaller object seems farther away than a large object that is presented at the same location.

=== Aerial perspective ===

Due to light scattering by the atmosphere, objects that are a great distance away have lower luminance contrast and lower color saturation. Due to this, images seem hazy the farther they are away from a person&#x27;s point of view. In computer graphics, this is often called &quot;distance fog&quot;. The foreground has high contrast; the background has low contrast. Objects differing only in their contrast with a background appear to be at different depths. The color of distant objects is also shifted toward the blue end of the spectrum (for example, distant mountains). Some painters, notably Cézanne, employ &quot;warm&quot; pigments (red, yellow and orange) to bring features forward towards the viewer, and &quot;cool&quot; ones (blue, violet, and blue-green) to indicate the part of a form that curves away from the picture plane.

=== Accommodation ===

Accommodation is an oculomotor cue for depth perception. When humans try to focus on distant objects, the ciliary muscles relax, allowing the eye lens to become thinner, which increases the focal length. Depth perception of distant objects is made possible by other methods besides accommodation. The kinesthetic sensations of the contracting and relaxing ciliary muscles (intraocular muscles) are sent to the visual cortex where they are used for interpreting distance and depth. Accommodation is only effective for distances less than 2 meters.

=== Occultation ===

Occultation (also referred to as &quot;interposition&quot;) happens when near surfaces overlap far surfaces. If one object partially blocks the view of another object, humans perceive it as closer. However, this information only allows the observer to make a &quot;ranking&quot; of relative nearness. The presence of monocular ambient occlusions consist of the object&#x27;s texture and geometry. These phenomena are able to reduce depth perception latency both in natural and artificial stimuli.

=== Curvilinear perspective ===

At the outer extremes of the visual field, parallel lines become curved, as in a photo taken through a fisheye lens. This effect, although it is usually eliminated from both art and photos by the cropping or framing of a picture, greatly enhances the viewer&#x27;s sense of being positioned within a real, three-dimensional space. (Classical perspective has no use for this so-called &quot;distortion&quot;, although in fact the &quot;distortions&quot; strictly obey optical laws and provide perfectly valid visual information, just as classical perspective does for the part of the field of vision that falls within its frame.)

=== Texture gradient ===

Fine details on nearby objects can be seen clearly, whereas such details are not visible on faraway objects. Texture gradients are the grains of an item. For example, on a long gravel road, the gravel near the observer can be clearly seen of shape, size and colour. In the distance, the road&#x27;s texture cannot be clearly differentiated.

=== Lighting and shading ===

The way that light falls on an object and reflects off its surfaces, and the shadows that are cast by objects provide an effective cue for the brain to determine the shape of objects and their position in space.

=== Defocus blur ===

Selective image blurring is very commonly used in photography and video to establish the impression of depth. This can act as a monocular cue even when all other cues are removed. It may contribute to depth perception in natural retinal images, because the depth of focus of the human eye is limited. In addition, there are several depth estimation algorithms based on defocus and blurring. Some jumping spiders are known to use image defocus to judge depth.

=== Elevation ===
When an object is visible relative to the horizon, humans tend to perceive objects which are closer to the horizon as being farther away from them, and objects which are farther from the horizon as being closer to them. In addition, if an object moves from a position close to the horizon to a position higher or lower than the horizon, it will appear to move closer to the viewer.

=== Ocular parallax ===
Ocular parallax is a perceptual effect where the rotation of the eye causes perspective-dependent image shifts. This happens because the optical center and the rotation center of the eye are not the same. Ocular parallax does not require head movement. It is separate and distinct from motion parallax.

== Binocular cues ==

Binocular cues provide depth information when viewing a scene with both eyes.

=== Stereopsis, or retinal (binocular) disparity, or binocular parallax ===

Animals that have their eyes placed frontally can also use information derived from the different projections of objects onto each retina to judge depth. By using two images of the same scene obtained from slightly different angles, it is possible to triangulate the distance to an object with a high degree of accuracy. Each eye views a slightly different angle of an object seen by the left and right eyes. This happens because of the horizontal separation parallax of the eyes. If an object is far away, the disparity of that image falling on both retinas will be small. If the object is close or near, the disparity will be large. It is stereopsis that tricks people into thinking they perceive depth when viewing Magic Eyes, autostereograms, 3-D movies, and stereoscopic photos.

=== Convergence ===

Convergence is a binocular oculomotor cue for distance and depth perception. Because of stereopsis, the two eyeballs focus on the same object; in doing so they converge. The convergence will stretch the extraocular musclesthe receptors for this are muscle spindles. As happens with the monocular accommodation cue, kinesthetic sensations from these extraocular muscles also help in distance and depth perception. The angle of convergence is smaller when the eye is fixating on objects which are far away. Convergence is effective for distances less than 10 meters.

=== Shadow stereopsis ===
Antonio Medina Puerta demonstrated that retinal images with no parallax disparity but with different shadows were fused stereoscopically, imparting depth perception to the imaged scene. He named the phenomenon &quot;shadow stereopsis&quot;. Shadows are therefore an important, stereoscopic cue for depth perception.

Of these various cues, only convergence, accommodation and familiar size provide absolute distance information. All other cues are relative (as in, they can only be used to tell which objects are closer relative to others). Stereopsis is merely relative because a greater or lesser disparity for nearby objects could either mean that those objects differ more or less substantially in relative depth or that the foveated object is nearer or further away (the further away a scene is, the smaller is the retinal disparity indicating the same depth difference).

== Theories of evolution ==
=== The law of Newton–Müller–Gudden ===
Isaac Newton proposed that the optic nerve of humans and other primates has a specific architecture on its way from the eye to the brain. Nearly half of the fibres from the human retina project to the brain hemisphere on the same side as the eye from which they originate. That architecture is labelled hemi-decussation or ipsilateral (same sided) visual projections (IVP). In most other animals, these nerve fibres cross to the opposite side of the brain.

Bernhard von Gudden showed that the OC contains both crossed and uncrossed retinal fibers, and Ramon y Cajal observed that the grade of hemidecussation differs between species. Gordon Lynn Walls formalized a commonly accepted notion into the law of Newton–Müller–Gudden (NGM) saying: that the degree of optic fibre decussation in the optic chiasm is contrariwise related to the degree of frontal orientation of the optical axes of the eyes. In other words, that the number of fibers that do not cross the midline is proportional to the size of the binocular visual field. However, an issue of the Newton–Müller–Gudden law is the considerable interspecific variation in IVP seen in non-mammalian species. That variation is unrelated to mode of life, taxonomic situation, and the overlap of visual fields.

Thus, the general hypothesis was for long that the arrangement of nerve fibres in the optic chiasm in primates and humans has developed primarily to create accurate depth perception, stereopsis, or explicitly that the eyes observe an object from somewhat dissimilar angles and that this difference in angle assists the brain to evaluate the distance.

=== The eye-forelimb (EF) hypothesis ===
The eye-forelimb (EF) hypothesis suggests that the need for accurate eye-hand control was key in the evolution of stereopsis. According to the EF hypothesis, stereopsis is evolutionary spinoff from a more vital process: that the construction of the optic chiasm and the position of eyes (the degree of lateral or frontal direction) is shaped by evolution to help the animal to coordinate the limbs (hands, claws, wings or fins).

The EF hypothesis postulates that it has a selective value to have short neural pathways between areas of the brain that receive visual information about the hand and the motor nuclei that control the coordination of the hand. The essence of the EF hypothesis is that evolutionary transformation in OC will affect the length and thereby speed of these neural pathways.
Having the primate type of OC means that motor neurons controlling/executing let us say right hand movement, neurons receiving sensory e.g. tactile information about the right hand, and neurons obtaining visual information about the right hand, all will be situated in the same (left) brain hemisphere. The reverse is true for the left hand, the processing of visual, tactile information, and motor commandall of which takes place in the right hemisphere. Cats and arboreal (tree-climbing) marsupials have analogous arrangements (between 30 and 45% of IVP and forward-directed eyes). The result will be that visual info of their forelimbs reaches the proper (executing) hemisphere.
The evolution has resulted in small, and gradual fluctuations in the direction of the nerve pathways in the OC. This transformation can go in either direction.
Snakes, cyclostomes and other animals that lack extremities have relatively many IVP. Notably these animals have no limbs (hands, paws, fins or wings) to direct. Besides, the left and right body parts of snakelike animals cannot move independently of each other. For example, if a snake coils clockwise, its left eye only sees the left body-part and in an anti-clock-wise position the same eye will see just the right body-part. For that reason, it is functional for snakes to have some IVP in the OC (Naked). Cyclostome descendants (in other words, most vertebrates) that due to evolution ceased to curl and, instead developed forelimbs would be favored by achieving completely crossed pathways as long as forelimbs were primarily occupied in a lateral direction. Reptiles such as snakes that lost their limbs, would gain by recollecting a cluster of uncrossed fibres in their evolution. That seems to have happened, providing further support for the EF hypothesis.

Mice&#x27; paws are usually busy only in the lateral visual fields. So, it is in accordance with the EF hypothesis that mice have laterally situated eyes and very few crossings in the OC. The list from the animal kingdom supporting the EF hypothesis is long (BBE). The EF hypothesis applies to essentially all vertebrates while the NGM law and stereopsis hypothesis largely apply just to mammals. Even some mammals display important exceptions, e.g. dolphins have only uncrossed pathways although they are predators.

It is a common suggestion that predatory animals generally have frontally-placed eyes since that permit them to evaluate the distance to prey, whereas preyed-upon animals have eyes in a lateral position, since that permit them to scan and detect the enemy in time. However, many predatory animals may also become prey, and several predators, for instance, the crocodile, have laterally situated eyes and no IVP at all. That OC architecture will provide short nerve connections and optimal eye control of the crocodile&#x27;s front foot.

Birds, usually have laterally situated eyes, in spite of that they manage to fly through e.g. a dense wood.
In conclusion, the EF hypothesis does not reject a significant role of stereopsis, but proposes that primates&#x27; superb depth perception (stereopsis) evolved to be in service of the hand; that the particular architecture of the primate visual system largely evolved to establish rapid neural pathways between neurons involved in hand coordination, assisting the hand in gripping the correct branch
Most open-plain herbivores, especially hoofed grazers, lack binocular vision because they have their eyes on the sides of the head, providing a panoramic, almost 360°, view of the horizonenabling them to notice the approach of predators from almost any direction. However, most predators have both eyes looking forwards, allowing binocular depth perception and helping them to judge distances when they pounce or swoop down onto their prey. Animals that spend a lot of time in trees take advantage of binocular vision in order to accurately judge distances when rapidly moving from branch to branch.

Matt Cartmill, a physical anthropologist and anatomist at Boston University, has criticized this theory, citing other arboreal species which lack binocular vision, such as squirrels and certain birds. Instead, he proposes a &quot;Visual Predation Hypothesis,&quot; which argues that ancestral primates were insectivorous predators resembling tarsiers, subject to the same selection pressure for frontal vision as other predatory species. He also uses this hypothesis to account for the specialization of primate hands, which he suggests became adapted for grasping prey, somewhat like the way raptors employ their talons.

== In art ==

Photographs capturing perspective are two-dimensional images that often illustrate the illusion of depth. Photography utilizes size, environmental context, lighting, textural gradience, and other effects to capture the illusion of depth. Stereoscopes and Viewmasters, as well as 3D films, employ binocular vision by forcing the viewer to see two images created from slightly different positions (points of view). Charles Wheatstone was the first to discuss depth perception being a cue of binocular disparity. He invented the stereoscope, which is an instrument with two eyepieces that displays two photographs of the same location/scene taken at relatively different angles. When observed, separately by each eye, the pairs of images induced a clear sense of depth. By contrast, a telephoto lens—used in televised sports, for example, to zero in on members of a stadium audience—has the opposite effect. The viewer sees the size and detail of the scene as if it were close enough to touch, but the camera&#x27;s perspective is still derived from its actual position a hundred meters away, so background faces and objects appear about the same size as those in the foreground.

Trained artists are keenly aware of the various methods for indicating spatial depth (color shading, distance fog, perspective and relative size), and take advantage of them to make their works appear &quot;real&quot;. The viewer feels it would be possible to reach in and grab the nose of a Rembrandt portrait or an apple in a Cézanne still life—or step inside a landscape and walk around among its trees and rocks.

Cubism was based on the idea of incorporating multiple points of view in a painted image, as if to simulate the visual experience of being physically in the presence of the subject, and seeing it from different angles. The radical experiments of Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso, Jean Metzinger&#x27;s &quot;Nu à la cheminée&quot;, Albert Gleizes&#x27;s &quot;La Femme aux Phlox&quot;, or Robert Delaunay&#x27;s views of the Eiffel Tower, employ the explosive angularity of Cubism to exaggerate the traditional illusion of three-dimensional space. The subtle use of multiple points of view can be found in the pioneering late work of Cézanne, which both anticipated and inspired the first actual Cubists. Cézanne&#x27;s landscapes and still lives powerfully suggest the artist&#x27;s own highly developed depth perception. At the same time, like the other Post-Impressionists, Cézanne had learned from Japanese art the significance of respecting the flat (two-dimensional) rectangle of the picture itself; Hokusai and Hiroshige ignored or even reversed linear perspective and thereby remind the viewer that a picture can only be &quot;true&quot; when it acknowledges the truth of its own flat surface. By contrast, European &quot;academic&quot; painting was devoted to a sort of Big Lie that the surface of the canvas is &quot;only&quot; an enchanted doorway to a &quot;real&quot; scene unfolding beyond, and that the artist&#x27;s main task is to distract the viewer from any disenchanting awareness of the presence of the painted canvas. Cubism, and indeed most of modern art is an attempt to confront, if not resolve, the paradox of suggesting spatial depth on a flat surface, and explore that inherent contradiction through innovative ways of seeing, as well as new methods of drawing and painting.

<doc id="302797" wikidata="Q2215067" url="?curid=302797" title="Ishtar (film)">
<text>Ishtar is a 1987 American adventure comedy film written and directed by Elaine May, and produced by Warren Beatty, who co-stars opposite Dustin Hoffman. The story revolves around a duo of talentless American songwriters who travel to a booking in Morocco and stumble into a four-party Cold War standoff.

Shot on location in Morocco and New York City by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, the production drew media attention before its release for substantial cost overruns on top of a lavish budget, and reports of clashes between May, Beatty, and Storaro. A change in studio management at Columbia Pictures during post-production also led to professional and personal difficulties that undermined the film&#x27;s release.

&quot;Ishtar&quot; polarized critics and became a notorious failure at the box office. Many initially considered it to be one of the worst films ever made, although critical support has increased significantly since release, to the point where it received two votes for the Greatest Movie of All Time in the 2022 iteration of the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; decennial polls. Its 2004 DVD release excluded North America, where a director&#x27;s cut, running two minutes shorter, was released on Blu-ray in August 2013.

==Plot==
Chuck Clarke and Lyle Rogers are inept songwriters who are down on their luck, but dream of becoming a popular singing duo like Simon and Garfunkel. Though they are poorly received at a local open mic night, agent Marty Freed offers to book them as lounge singers in a hotel in Marrakesh, Morocco, explaining that the last act quit due to political unrest in the area. Nearly broke, both single, and without any better options, Lyle and Chuck decide to take the gig.

When they arrive in the fictional neighboring country of Ishtar, Chuck agrees to give his passport to a mysterious woman who claims her life is in danger. She promises to meet him in Marrakesh. Unfortunately, Chuck learns at the U.S. Embassy that it will take longer than expected to get a new passport. Lyle goes to Morocco in a bid to save their booking while Chuck stays behind.

Alone in Ishtar, Chuck meets CIA agent Jim Harrison. Chuck agrees to be a mole for the CIA and, in return, Harrison gets Chuck to Morocco by the next evening.

Now together again, Chuck and Lyle unwittingly become involved in a plot to overthrow the Emir of Ishtar. The mysterious woman, Shirra Assel, sneaks into Lyle&#x27;s room and tries to steal his luggage, mistaking it for Chuck&#x27;s. At the airport, she had stuck some of her items into Chuck&#x27;s luggage, because that was her only way of smuggling them out of Ishtar. She later breaks into their room and goes through Chuck&#x27;s luggage, but she fails to find an ancient, prophetic map that her archaeologist brother Omar had found. Shirra needs this map in order to command the loyalties of the left-wing guerrillas who oppose the government of Ishtar.

Shirra later confronts Chuck and accuses him of working with the CIA, and Chuck accuses her of being a communist. Meanwhile, Lyle attempts to find a camel salesman named Mohamad and gives him the secret code of &quot;I want to buy a blind camel,&quot; as per Shirra&#x27;s instructions, but Lyle finds the wrong Mohamad and ends up actually buying a blind camel. Chuck and Lyle receive instructions from both the CIA and the leftist guerillas to go into the desert, and both parties actually intend for them to die there.

In the desert, Chuck pulls his jacket over his head to shield himself from the sun, and Lyle sees that the legendary map is sewn inside of the jacket. The jacket was originally Omar&#x27;s, but Shirra took it, and then Chuck and Shirra traded jackets. The CIA sends helicopters to finish off Chuck and Lyle, but Shirra and a cab driver arrive in the desert and defend them.

Chuck and Lyle mail the map to their agent Marty Freed, who blackmails the CIA with the map. The CIA ends up having to support Shirra leading social reforms in the country, and back an album written by &quot;Rogers and Clarke&quot; with a tour starting in Morocco. At the show, Shirra is in the audience. Meanwhile, a military officer orders the rest of the men in uniform that make up the audience to &quot;APPLAUD!&quot; when the songs are finished.

==Production==

=== Development ===

==== Pre-production ====
Warren Beatty felt indebted to Elaine May, who, in addition to co-writing his 1978 hit &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, had done a major uncredited rewrite on the script of his Academy Award-winning &quot;Reds&quot; and helped immensely with its post-production. He began looking for a project that she could write and direct. She had never, he believed, had a sufficiently protective producer, and by starring in and producing her next film he could give her the chance to make the film he believed her to be creatively and commercially capable of making.

At a dinner with Beatty and Bert Fields, their agent, May said she would like to do a variant on the &quot;Road to ...&quot; films of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, set in the Middle East. Her idea would feature Beatty and a co-star as a mediocre singer-songwriter duo who would go to Morocco and get caught in the crossfire between the Central Intelligence Agency and a local left-wing guerrilla group. She thought it would be funny to cast Beatty against type as the Hope part, the bumbler of the duo, while the co-star, possibly Dustin Hoffman, would play the self-assured ladies&#x27; man that Crosby usually portrayed.

Hoffman, who was also indebted to May for her extensive uncredited rewrite on &quot;Tootsie&quot;, initially turned it down due to &quot;misgivings&quot;. At Beatty&#x27;s request, the two met with May and Hoffman&#x27;s creative confidant, playwright Murray Schisgal. The latter two felt that the plot in Morocco overwhelmed the rest of the film and that it &quot;should not leave New York&quot;. Hoffman was finally persuaded by Beatty&#x27;s assurances that he would provide May with the room she needed to work.

When May finished the script, Beatty, Hoffman, and some other friends including Charles Grodin had a meeting and read-through at Beatty&#x27;s house. All present agreed that the script needed work, but it was funny and could be a hit.

Beatty went to Columbia Pictures production head Guy McElwaine, who years before had been his publicist, instructing Fields, &quot;Bert, anything she wants. Period. That&#x27;s my negotiating position.&quot; Despite the prospect of having two major stars on the same project with a well-regarded writer, McElwaine did not immediately approve it. He worried about the effects of having Beatty, Hoffman, and May on the same set because they were all known to be perfectionists. May, in particular, had a reputation for shooting as much raw footage as Beatty or Stanley Kubrick. However, McElwaine was also afraid the property could be a hit for another studio if Columbia passed, because Beatty had a solid record of commercial success in his four movies as producer and star.

The two bankable stars and May received $12.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) in salaries before principal photography began. Beatty and Hoffman offered to defer theirs, but Columbia declined; Fields said that an agreement the studio had with HBO covered most of that cost. Beatty, Hoffman, and May all had final cut input as well (although Beatty has denied this). The film&#x27;s original budget was set at $27.5 million.

Other roles were cast through connections to the three. Grodin was a friend of May and had starred in a successful comedy she directed, the original version of &quot;The Heartbreak Kid.&quot; Isabelle Adjani, who played the female lead disguised as a boy for most of the film, was Beatty&#x27;s girlfriend at the time. Vittorio Storaro replaced original cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno when Rotunno was unable to change his schedule to accommodate a delay in shooting.

Paul Williams began working on the songs the lead duo would sing. &quot;The real task was to write songs that were believably bad. It was one of the best jobs I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. I&#x27;ve never had more fun on a picture, but I&#x27;ve never worked harder.&quot; May preferred that Williams write whole songs, even if she intended to use only a few lines, and then teach them to the stars and have them perform them, necessitating more time and money.

The studio had wanted to shoot the desert scenes in the Southwestern United States in order to keep costs down and production under control. However, Columbia&#x27;s parent company at the time, Coca-Cola, had money in Morocco it could not repatriate, so the studio relented and allowed production to take place in the real Sahara Desert. It was expected that shooting in Morocco would take ten weeks, after which the New York scenes would be shot.

==== Principal photography ====
&quot;Ishtar&quot; began principal photography in October 1985, amidst high political tensions in North Africa. Israeli warplanes had just bombed Palestine Liberation Organization headquarters in Tunis and, seven days later, the Palestine Liberation Front hijacked a cruise ship, the &quot;Achille Lauro&quot;, murdering an American citizen named Leon Klinghoffer. The Moroccan military was fighting the Polisario Front guerrillas at the time as well. There were rumors that Palestinian terrorists might try to kidnap Hoffman, and some locations had to be checked for land mines before the shooting could begin.

There were also production difficulties. The filmmakers appreciated the Moroccans&#x27; hospitality and willingness to cooperate, but there was no one in the country with experience supporting a major Hollywood film production. Requests by the producers were sometimes unfulfilled, and calls for local extras led to thousands of people showing up.

Some of the film&#x27;s production woes have become Hollywood lore. The film&#x27;s animal trainer went looking for a blue-eyed camel in the Marrakech market and found one he considered perfect. However, he chose not to buy it right away, expecting he could find others and use that knowledge to bargain with the first trader for a better price. He did not realize that blue-eyed camels were rare, and could not find another camel good enough. He returned to the first trader, who since had eaten the camel.

Another frequently related incident, as told by production designer Paul Sylbert but disputed by others on the film, concerns the dunes where scenes with Beatty and Hoffman lost in the desert would be shot. Sylbert had scouted dunes in the United States and Morocco but none seemed to fit the vision of May, who was very uncomfortable in the desert environment. She suffered from toothaches that she refused to have treated locally, and took extensive measures to shelter herself from the harsh sun, not only spending much of her time under a large parasol but wearing large sunglasses and wrapping her face in a white gauze veil, to the point that her appearance was compared to a &quot;Star Wars&quot; stormtrooper. After one unsuccessful search for dunes, Sylbert says, May suddenly announced she wanted a flat landscape instead. It took ten days to level an area of a square mile (2.6 km²).

May feuded with others on set as well. She and Storaro frequently differed over camera placements, because she was looking for the ideal comic effect while the cinematographer, who had little experience making comedies, sought the most ideal composition. Beatty often took Storaro&#x27;s side in disputes between him and May. &quot;She probably felt ganged up on by the two of them,&quot; Hoffman observed later on. Eventually, Beatty and May began quarreling, and Hoffman sometimes served as the mediator. He claims there were times when the two were not speaking to each other. May also did not get along with Adjani, which adversely affected the latter&#x27;s relationship with Beatty.

The director remained aloof from the film&#x27;s editing staff, taking copious notes during dailies but refusing to share them. As Columbia had feared, she shot a large amount of film as well, reportedly in one instance calling for fifty takes of vultures landing next to Beatty and Hoffman.

Expenses continued to grow. &quot;This was the kind of film where nobody would say &#x27;Sorry, we can&#x27;t afford that,&#x27;&quot; according to Mac Brown, who monitored the budget. When a replacement part was needed for a camera, it was sent over to Morocco with a New York-based location coordinator instead of just being shipped, out of fear it might get lost or held up at customs. The coordinator&#x27;s airfare and a week&#x27;s hotel stay were paid for by the production.

Privately, both Beatty and May began to confess they had made a mistake. &quot;I was going to give this gift to Elaine, and it turned out to be the opposite,&quot; Hoffman recalls Beatty telling him. Matters came to a head when it came time to shoot the film&#x27;s climactic battle scenes. They were far outside May&#x27;s background in improvisational theatre, and during a confrontation with Beatty, May said, &quot;You want it done? &quot;You&quot; shoot it!&quot; Many crew members said that, on any other film, the director would have been fired. Beatty knew that if he called her bluff, he would have had to finish directing the film, which would have been a major embarrassment given that his main objective in making the film was to give May the chance she had never had. He compromised by scaling back the battle scenes.

When the film returned to New York, Beatty told then-Columbia CEO Fay Vincent that May could not direct. However, he rejected another suggestion to fire her, citing his image as a supporter of women&#x27;s rights. Vincent said he would do it, but Beatty said if he did then he and Hoffman would leave the uncompleted film as well. He proposed instead that every scene be shot twice, his way and May&#x27;s, effectively doubling the movie&#x27;s cost.

After a month-long break, the New York scenes were shot in early 1986, at Kaufman Astoria Studios and various locations. Due to union work rules, Storaro&#x27;s Italian crew had to be doubled by a local standby crew, who were usually not needed but drew full pay for the entire shoot. It was also necessary to stop production for several days so Beatty and Hoffman could rehearse their songs.

In April 1986, a month after principal photography wrapped, Vincent fired McElwaine. His replacement as head of the production was David Puttnam, producer of &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; and a longtime critic of Hollywood budgetary excesses. Among those films he had specifically criticized in the latter category was &quot;Reds&quot;, singling out Beatty in particular. He also publicly criticized Hoffman for allegedly using his star power to force rewrites to the 1979 film &quot;Agatha,&quot; which had promoted his minor character to a lead. After quitting as a producer of that film, Puttnam called Hoffman &quot;the most malevolent person I have ever worked with&quot;.

==== Post-production ====
Due to his history with both stars, the new studio head promised to stay out of &quot;Ishtar&quot;&#x27;s post-production, but Beatty and Hoffman felt that move was subtly intended to undermine the film by suggesting it was a failure for which he wanted to avoid responsibility. They worried it would hurt the film when it was released before Christmas 1986.

Interpersonal difficulties from Morocco continued in post-production. May was supposed to direct actors when they looped their lines in a recording studio, but sometimes left the job to Beatty or one of the editors. Most of those absences were in sessions with Adjani, who was required to lower her voice because her character had to pass as a boy for most of the film. This strained her relationship with Beatty even more.

The film&#x27;s raw footage before editing, known as &#x27;rushes&#x27;, came to 108 hours, more than three times that typical for a comedy. Three teams of editors, one each for Beatty, Hoffman, and May worked almost continuously to produce cuts of the film to each principal&#x27;s liking. Because McElwaine, whom he had tried to please as a friend, was no longer in charge, Beatty eventually relented to letting May cut the film her way, partly because he detested Puttnam and believed he was leaking negative information about &quot;Ishtar&quot; to the media. &quot;Just tell the asshole to keep paying the bills,&quot; he is reported to have told another Columbia executive. The costs, which Puttnam had believed would come under control in post-production, instead continued to mount.

Eventually, it became clear the film would not be ready in time for Christmas. When the release date of late spring of 1987 was announced, later than had been expected, stories in the media about the film&#x27;s troubles increased. Industry insiders began to refer to it as &quot;The Road to Ruin&quot; and &quot;Warrensgate&quot;, after the expensive 1980 flop &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;. Beatty, who had kept the media off the set during production, took these gibes personally, and he and May began to fight more frequently in the editing room.

Finally, with the new release date looming, Bert Fields was called in to mediate between the director and stars. Beatty denies this, but Fields and others say he was present in the editing room. The agent has been described as having final cut, although he claims that was May&#x27;s. Tensions continued as Beatty was trying to placate Adjani and lobbied for more footage of her. When they were finished, the editors were furious as no one had gone over the complete film. Beatty refused to show Puttnam the final cut.

=== Sexual assault allegations ===

On December 14, 2017, &quot;Variety&quot; published a report in which a woman named Melissa Kester, as well as an additional source who chose to remain anonymous, accused Dustin Hoffman of sexually assaulting them during the production of &quot;Ishtar&quot;. This report came in part as a response a series of sexual misconduct allegations made against Hoffman earlier that year.

In the &quot;Variety&quot; article, Kester, whose boyfriend worked on the music for &quot;Ishtar&quot;, alleged that, while recording a vocal track for one of the film&#x27;s songs, Hoffman invited her into an isolation booth and inserted his fingers into her genitalia. Kester estimated that this interaction lasted for 15 to 20 seconds. Kester later recounted the incident to a close friend, who confirmed her account for the &quot;Variety&quot; article. In the same article, an anonymous source, who worked as an unnamed extra in one of the film&#x27;s nightclub sequences, claimed that Hoffman engaged in a similar action while riding home from a wrap party with her in a station wagon. She also alleged that he then directed her to the San Remo apartment complex, where he lived at the time, and engaged in oral sex and sexual intercourse with her, interactions that she claimed arose from dubious consent on her part. The source was 22 years old at the time of the alleged incidents.

Hoffman did not provide any comment for the &quot;Variety&quot; article, nor has he responded to the allegations publicly. However, in response to the article, Hoffman&#x27;s attorney Mark A. Neubauer wrote a letter to the Penske Media Corporation, which owns &quot;Variety&quot;, in which he called the allegations &quot;defamatory falsehoods&quot;.

==Release==

===Box office===
Negative buzz about &quot;Ishtar&quot; and its high budget was widespread in the press long before the film reached theaters. In an interview with May, Mike Nichols described the bomb as &quot;the prime example that I know of in Hollywood of studio suicide&quot;, implying that Puttnam sandbagged the project by leaking negative anecdotes to the media because of his grudges against Beatty and Hoffman. Before release, market research led Columbia to believe the film would fail. Its head of marketing, Peter Sealey, advised the studio to minimize its losses by cutting the film&#x27;s advertising budget. Instead, Columbia spent even more to promote the film, afraid of alienating Beatty and Hoffman. &quot;Ego trumps logic in Hollywood,&quot; said Sealey.

Despite negative press, three previews went well, with Beatty describing one in Toronto as the best he had ever had, and he and the studio considered striking more prints. Those discussions ended following the opening weekend, wherein &quot;Ishtar&quot;, on more than 1,000 screens across the country, took in $4.2 million (equivalent to $ in ) in receipts, winning the weekend, being No. 1 at the box office. However, it outgrossed &quot;The Gate&quot;—a low-budget horror film with no stars—by a mere $100,000, and ultimately earned $14.3 million at the North American box office.

Against a $51 million production budget and up to another $20 million spent on prints and marketing costs, the film is estimated to have lost $40 million. &quot;Ishtar&quot; has become synonymous with the phrase &quot;box office flop&quot;, and in 2014, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; listed the film as one of the most expensive box-office flops of all time.

&quot;Chicago Reader&quot; critic Jonathan Rosenbaum surmised that the media were eager to torpedo &quot;Ishtar&quot; in retaliation for instances of Beatty&#x27;s perceived &quot;high-handed way with members of the press&quot;. The film had been completely closed to the media, with no reporters at all permitted on set during production, a restriction greater than Beatty&#x27;s previous productions. Specifically, Rosenbaum mentions critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert: &quot;he was really getting them very irritated, and using them as the butt of all these jokes, and so on. And so the point is that if you start multiplying that in terms of the treatment [of] a lot of other people in the press, &quot;Ishtar&quot; was their one chance finally to get even.&quot;

===Critical reception===
The film had a polarizing effect on critics upon release. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s critics were split: Desson Thomson described the film as an &quot;unabashed vamp for a pair of household names, and as such it works, often hilariously&quot;, while Hal Hinson wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s piddling—a hangdog little comedy with not enough laughs.&quot; Ebert wrote for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; that &quot;&quot;Ishtar&quot; is a truly dreadful film, a lifeless, massive, lumbering exercise in failed comedy&quot; and Siskel called it &quot;shockingly dull&quot; and &quot;dim-witted&quot;; together, they selected it as the worst film of 1987 on &quot;At the Movies&quot;. Leonard Maltin gave the film 2-stars-out-of-4, writing &quot;A blind camel and a flock of vultures steal the show, and Paul Williams&#x27; deliberately awful songs are funny too, but not funny enough to overcome of flatness of director May&#x27;s script.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was more forgiving, writing &quot;The worst of it is painless; the best is funny, sly, cheerful and, here and there, even genuinely inspired.&quot; Vincent Canby—also for the &quot;Times&quot;—listed it as a runner-up to his top films of 1987. Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was also positive, writing &quot;It is a smart, generous, genuinely funny affair. Sometimes, like the camel who almost ambles away with the picture, it&#x27;s longish in the tooth, but it is based on an extremely astute vision of life.&quot; A retrospective review from Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; stated: &quot;This Elaine May comedy was the most underappreciated commercial movie of 1987. It isn&#x27;t quite as good as May&#x27;s previous features, but it&#x27;s still a very funny work by one of this country&#x27;s greatest comic talents.&quot;

 Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;C+&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

==Aftermath==
As a result of the losses it suffered from the film and negative publicity, Coca-Cola re-evaluated its decision to enter the business. It spun off its entertainment holdings into a separate company named Columbia Pictures Entertainment (now Sony Pictures Entertainment), with Coca-Cola holding 49% of the stock. Two years later, it sold Columbia to Sony.

&quot;Ishtar&quot; was nominated for three Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay, with May winning Worst Director, tied with Norman Mailer for &quot;Tough Guys Don&#x27;t Dance&quot;. &quot;Ishtar&quot; also was nominated for Worst Picture at the 1987 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards. When the Stinkers unveiled their &quot;100 Years, 100 Stinkers&quot; list to present the 100 worst movies of the 20th century, &quot;Ishtar&quot; made the list and ranked at No. 20 in the listed bottom 20.

The film&#x27;s failure did not affect the friendship between Beatty and Hoffman, who both liked the final cut; Beatty went on to cast his co-star in his more successful &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;.

Beatty and May barely spoke for two years afterward, and friends of hers say she remains bitter about the experience. She would wait nine years before taking another screenwriting credit (for &quot;The Birdcage&quot;). She was nominated for an Academy Award for &quot;Primary Colors&quot;, but has not directed another film since &quot;Ishtar&quot;.

On December 20, 2010, Hoffman appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; with Robert De Niro. When Letterman asked the actors if any of their films made them &quot;wince a little bit&quot;, Hoffman joked, &quot;Well, I&#x27;m sure Bob feels ambivalent about &quot;Ishtar.&quot;&quot; (Letterman looked at his notes and observed that De Niro wasn&#x27;t in that film.)

===Legacy===
The McClatchy-Tribune News Service wrote in 2011 that &quot;Time has not improved this film&#x27;s reputation as being one of the worst ever made.&quot; &quot;Time Out&quot; suggested it was &quot;so bad it could have been deliberate&quot; and called it &quot;one of the worst films ever made.&quot; It was included in Michael Sauter&#x27;s &quot;The Worst Movies of All Time&quot; book and Richard Roeper included it on his list of the 40 worst films he had seen. In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; placed the film on a list of the 100 worst ideas of the 20th century.

However, particularly since its 2013 Blu-ray release, &quot;Ishtar&quot; has received a wave of positive reviews and retrospectives from a number of publications, including the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;IndieWire&quot;, and &quot;The Dissolve&quot;. Richard Brody of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called &quot;Ishtar&quot; a &quot;wrongly maligned masterwork&quot; and raved, &quot;There&#x27;s a level of invention, a depth of reflection, and a tangle of emotions in &quot;Ishtar&quot; which are reached by few films and few filmmakers.&quot; Charles Bramesco of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote upon the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, &quot;While &quot;Ishtar&quot; has not appreciated into a stealth masterpiece in the mold of &quot;Showgirls&quot;&#x27; long road to reappraisal, its stature as the definitive cinematic failure has been outed as undeserved.&quot; Filmmakers Quentin Tarantino, Lena Dunham, Joe Swanberg, and Edgar Wright have all publicly praised &quot;Ishtar&quot;, and Martin Scorsese has further cited it as one of his favorite films of all time. The film received two votes, from critic Colin Beckett and filmmaker Daniel Goldhaber, on the 2022 list of the greatest films of all time as chosen by the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; decennial polls of critics and filmmakers.

In one of Gary Larson&#x27;s &quot;The Far Side&quot; comic strips, captioned &quot;Hell&#x27;s Video Store&quot;, the entire store is stocked with nothing but copies of &quot;Ishtar&quot;. Larson later apologized, saying: &quot;When I drew the above cartoon, I had not actually seen &quot;Ishtar&quot;. [...] Years later, I saw it on an airplane, and was stunned at what was happening to me: I was actually being entertained. Sure, maybe it&#x27;s not the greatest film ever made, but my cartoon was way off the mark. There are so many cartoons for which I should probably write an apology, but this is the only one which compels me to do so.&quot;

The film&#x27;s creators continue to defend it. Despite the trouble he endured while making it, Beatty has been quoted as saying, &quot;There was almost no review that didn&#x27;t in the first paragraph deal with the cost of the movie. That was an eye-opener—about the business, and the relationship of the entertainment press to business. &quot;Ishtar&quot; is a very good, not very big, comedy, made by a brilliant woman. And I think it&#x27;s funny.&quot; Hoffman has also vouched for &quot;Ishtar&quot;, saying, &quot;I liked that film. [...] Just about everyone I&#x27;ve ever met that makes a face when the name is brought up has not seen it. [...] I would do it again in a second.&quot; In 2006, May stated, &quot;If all of the people who hate &quot;Ishtar&quot; had seen it, I would be a rich woman today.&quot;

A documentary about the film, &quot;Waiting for Ishtar: A Love Letter to the Most Misunderstood Movie of All Time&quot;, was released in 2017.

==Home video==
&quot;Ishtar&quot; was issued on VHS globally in late 1987 (and once more in 1994), eventually generating more than seven million dollars in rental fees in the United States alone.

In 2004, the film was released on DVD on every continent but North America and Antarctica. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment had announced that the film would be released only on Blu-ray Disc (and finally in a digital format in North America) on January 4, 2011, but it was pulled from the studio&#x27;s release schedule just before this date.

In an interview around the time, May said:

They tell me now—Sony—that they&#x27;re going to release this on Blu-ray, and it will really look wonderful and sound wonderful. If they don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll be the last 80 or 90 or however many people to see this movie in this particular version...If you all clap your hands and believe it! They say they want to and they&#x27;ll do it soon, and I have great faith that they&#x27;ll do it.

The Blu-ray was eventually released in North America on August 6, 2013.

<text>David Shaltiel (; 16 January 1903 – February 1969) was an Israeli military and intelligence officer, later also diplomat, and was most well known for being the district commander of the Haganah in Jerusalem during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

==Biography==
David Shaltiel was born on 16 January 1903 in Berlin into a Portuguese Sephardic family, the oldest son of Benjamin Sealtiel and Helene Wormser. At 16, Shaltiel joined the Zionist youth movement Blau Weiss, and he went to Palestine in 1923. However, he was not happy there, and returned to Europe in 1925. From 1925 to 1930 he was enlisted in the French Foreign Legion. In 1934 he returned to Palestine. There he started working for the Haganah, being charged with buying arms in Europe. In 1936 he was captured in Aachen, Germany, by Gestapo. Shaltiel spent the next three years in prisons/concentration camps, including Dachau and Buchenwald. When he was sent to Berlin in 1939 the Haganah succeeded in freeing him. He then went back to Palestine. There he was at first arrested for his suspected involvement in the murder of three Arabs, but the charges were eventually dropped.

Shaltiel was married twice – first to Inge, then in 1942 to Yehudit, born Judith Irmgard Schonstedt (1913–2010), psychologist and daughter of a rabbinic family from Berlin. Shaltiel and Yehudit adopted a little girl, Tamar, who had to be returned to her biological mother. He died in Jerusalem in February 1969.

==Military career==
In 1942–43, he was the Haganah Commander in Haifa.
Fulfilling also the office of commander of the Counterintelligence Service - the &quot;Ran&quot; - and of the Intelligence Service – the Shin Yud or SHAI – of the Haganah, he was involved in the conflicts between the Haganah and the other Jewish underground groups - Irgun and Lehi.

Later, as Haganah&#x27;s link to these organizations, he helped them coordinate several missions with the Haganah, among them the widely condemned attack at Deir Yassin. In 1948, he was the local Haganah district commander when the village was attacked by Irgun and Lehi&#x27;s Jewish fighters, despite a non-aggression pact signed between the Zionists and the Mukhtar of the village, the villagers wanting to remain neutral in the war. At first Shaltiel did not agree with attacking Deir Yassin, but after a day he surrendered and wrote a letter to Irgun and Lehi, saying that he had &quot;no objection to your carrying out the operation&quot;. Yitzchak Levi, head of the Jerusalem branch of Haganah Intelligence (SHAI), proposed that the inhabitants should be notified that the truce was over, but Shaltiel then refused to endanger the operation by warning them.

He was also the mastermind behind Operation Kedem, which had the goal of capturing &quot;East Jerusalem&quot;. The mission was carried out July 8, 1948, by Irgun troops and was a total failure. From that moment, he was, (according to himself), disgraced and his name was erased from official Israel history.

Between June 11 and July 21, 1948, he had a series of meetings, mediated by the UN, with Abdullah el Tell, the commander of Arab Legion troops in the Old City.
On July 7 they signed the &quot;Mount Scopus Agreement&quot;, which stated that the Jewish enclave at Mount Scopus should be de-militarized and would come under UN supervision. On July 15 the Haganah and Irgun launched a massive bombardment on the Old City, which was followed by infantry attacks on the New, Jaffa and Zion Gates. These failed to gain their objectives. On 21 July Shaltiel and el Tell signed a formal cease-fire based on the existing positions of their forces.

After the end of the Independence War, David Shaltiel founded the Border Corps of the Israeli army, Heyl Hasfar, and was its first commander. Later, because of administrative problems, he recommended the transfer of these units into the frame of the Israeli Police, and they became known as Border Guard, Mishmar Hagvul.

==Diplomatic career==
In the years 1950–1952 Shaltiel served as military attaché of Israel in France, and later fulfilled several diplomatic charges - as Israel&#x27;s plenipotentiary minister in Brazil, Venezuela and Cuba (1952–1956), then in Mexico and concurrently to the Dominican Republic and Honduras (1956–1959) and ambassador in Netherlands (1963–1966).

<text>Alexandre Georges Henri Regnault (31 October 1843 – 19 January 1871) was a French painter.

==Biography==
Regnault was born in Paris, the son of Henri Victor Regnault. On leaving school he successively entered the studios of Antoine Montfort, Louis Lamothe and Alexandre Cabanel, was beaten for the &quot;Prix de Rome&quot; (1863) by Joseph Layraud and Xaiver Monchablon, and in 1864 exhibited two unremarkable portraits at the Paris Salon. In 1866, however, he carried off the &quot;Prix de Rome&quot; with a work of unusual force and distinction &quot;Thetis bringing the Arms forged by Vulcan to Achilles&quot; (École de Beaux-Arts).

The past in Italy did not touch him, but his illustrations to Wey&#x27;s &quot;Rome&quot; show how observant he was of actual life and manners; even his &quot;Automedon&quot; (School of Fine Arts), executed in obedience to Academical regulations, was but a lively recollection of a carnival horse-race. At Rome, moreover, Regnault came into contact with the modern Hispano-Italian school, a school highly materialistic and inclined to regard even the human subject only as one amongst many sources of visual amusement. The vital, if narrow, energy of this school told on Regnault with ever-increasing force during the few remaining years of his life.

In 1868 he had sent to the Salon a life-size portrait of a lady in which he had made one of the first attempts to render the actual character of fashionable modern life. While making a tour in Spain, he saw General Juan Prim pass at the head of his troops, and received that lively image of a military demagogue which he afterwards put on canvas, somewhat to the displeasure of his subject. But this work made an appeal to the imagination of the public, while all the later productions of Regnault were addressed exclusively to the eye.

After a further trip to North Africa, abridged by the necessities of his position as a pensioner of the school of Rome, he painted &quot;Judith&quot;, then, in 1870, &quot;Salomé&quot;, and, as a work due from the Roman school, dispatched from Tangier the large canvas, &quot;Execution Without Hearing Under the Moorish Kings&quot;. The Franco-Prussian War arose, and found Regnault at the Battle of Buzenval, where he was killed on 19 January 1871.

His friend, the composer Camille Saint-Saëns dedicated his &quot;Marche héroïque&quot; (1871) to Regnault&#x27;s memory. The sculptor Henri Chapu erected a monument to him in the courtyard of the École des Beaux-Arts in 1872. Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier painted him in the centre of his &quot;Le siège de Paris&quot; as the soldier collapsed against the personification of Paris.
