<text>[[Hinduism]] in Southeast Asia had a profound impact on the region&#x27;s cultural development and its history. As the Indic scripts were introduced from the Indian subcontinent, people of Southeast Asia entered the historical period by producing their earliest inscriptions around the 1st to 5th century CE. Today, Hindus in Southeast Asia are mainly Overseas Indians and Balinese. There are also Javanese (also other minorities of Indonesia) and Balamon Cham minority in Cambodia and south central Vietnam who also practice Hinduism.

Hindu civilization, which itself formed from various distinct cultures and peoples, including also early Southeast Asian, specifically Mon Khmer influence, was adopted and assimilated into the indigenous social construct and statehood of Southeast Asian regional polity. Through the formation of Indianized kingdoms, small indigenous polities led by petty chieftain were transformed into major kingdoms and empires led by a Maharaja with statecraft akin to India. It gave birth to the former Champa civilisation in southern parts of South Central Vietnam, Funan in Southern Vietnam, the Khmer Empire in Indochina, Langkasuka Kingdom and Old Kedah in the Malay Peninsula, the Sriwijayan kingdom on Sumatra, the Mataram Kingdom, Singhasari and the Majapahit Empire based in Java, Bali and parts of the Philippine archipelago. The civilisation of India influenced the languages, scripts, written tradition, literatures, calendars, beliefs system and artistic aspects of these peoples and nations.

A reason for the acceptance of Indian culture and religious traditions in Southeast Asia was because Indian culture already some striking similarities to indigenous cultures of Southeast Asia, which can be explained by earlier Southeast Asian (specifically Austroasiatic, such as early Munda and Mon Khmer groups) and Himalayan (Tibetic) cultural and linguistic influence on local Indian peoples. Several scholars, such as Professor Przyluski, Jules Bloch, and Lévi, among others, concluded that there is a significant cultural, linguistic, and political Mon-Khmer (Austroasiatic) influence on early Indian culture and traditions. India is seen a melting pot of western, eastern and indigenous traditions.

== Ancient era ==
Indian scholars wrote about the Dwipantara or Jawa Dwipa Hindu kingdom in Java and Sumatra around 200 BC. &quot;Yawadvipa&quot; is mentioned in India&#x27;s earliest epic, the Ramayana. Sugriva, the chief of Rama&#x27;s army dispatched his men to Yawadvipa, the island of Java, in search of Sita. It was hence referred to by the Sanskrit name &quot;yāvaka dvīpa&quot; (dvīpa = island). Southeast Asia was frequented by traders from eastern India, particularly Kalinga, as well as from the kingdoms of South India. The Indianised Tarumanagara kingdom was established in West Java around 400s, produced among the earliest inscriptions in Indonesian history. There was a marked Buddhist influence starting about 425 in the region. Around the 6th century, Kalingga Indianized kingdom was established on the northern coast of Central Java. The kingdom name was derived from Kalinga east coast of India. These Southeast Asian seafaring peoples engaged in extensive trade with India and China. Which attracted the attention of the Mongols, Chinese and Japanese, as well as Islamic traders, who reached the Aceh area of Sumatra in the 12th century. Medieval Indian scholars also referred to the Philippines as &quot;Panyupayana&quot; (The lands surrounded by water).

Examples of the Hindu cultural influence found today throughout the Southeast Asia owe much to the legacy of the Chola dynasty. For example, the great temple complex at Prambanan in Indonesia exhibit a number of similarities with the South Indian architecture.

According to the Malay chronicle &quot;Sejarah Melayu&quot;, the rulers of the Malacca Sultanate claimed to be descendants of the kings of the Chola Empire. Chola rule is remembered in Malaysia today as many princes there have names ending with Cholan or Chulan, one such being Raja Chulan, the Raja of Perak.

The Chola school of art also spread to Southeast Asia and influenced the architecture and art of Southeast Asia.

Some scholars have pointed out that the legends of Ikshvaku and Sumati may have their origin in the Southeast-Asian myth of the birth of humanity from a bitter gourd. The legend of Sumati, the wife of King Sagar, tells that she produced offspring with the aid of a bitter gourd.

== Modern era ==
Today, vibrant and diverse Hindu communities spread across Southeast Asia remain especially in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Medan (Indonesia) and the Philippines mainly due to the presence of Indians, such as Tamil people, who migrated from the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia in past centuries. One notably Southeast Asian aspect of Tamil Hinduism is the festival of Thaipusam, while other Hindu religious festivals such as Diwali are also well-observed by Hindus in the region. In Thailand and Cambodia, Thai and Khmer people practised Hindu rituals and traditions along with their Buddhist faith, and Hindu gods such as Brahma are still widely revered.

In Indonesia, it is not only people of Indian descent who practice Hinduism; Hinduism still survives as the major religion in Bali, where native Indonesians, the Balinese people, adheres to Agama Hindu Dharma, a variant of Hinduism derived from ancient Java-Bali Hindu traditions developed in the island for almost two millennia that often incorporates native spiritual elements. Other than the Balinese, a small enclave of Javanese Hindu minorities are also can be found in Java, such as around Tengger mountain ranges near Bromo and Semeru volcanoes, Karanganyar Regency in Central Java, and near Prambanan, Yogyakarta. Similarly, Hinduism is also found among the Cham minority in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia: just like the Javanese, the majority of them are Muslims but a minority are Hindu. In other parts of Indonesia, the term &quot;Hindu Dharma&quot; is often loosely used as an umbrella category to identify native spiritual beliefs and indigenous religions such as Hindu Kaharingan professed by Dayak of Kalimantan.

The resurgence of Hinduism in Indonesia is occurring in all parts of the country. In the early 1970s, the Toraja people of Sulawesi were the first to be identified under the umbrella of &#x27;Hinduism&#x27;, followed by the Karo Batak of Sumatra in 1977 and the Ngaju Dayak of Kalimantan in 1980. In an unpublished report in 1999, the National Indonesian Bureau of Statistics admitted that around 100,000 people had officially converted or &#x27;reconverted&#x27; from Islam to Hinduism over the previous two decades.

The Ministry of Religious Affairs, as of 2007, estimated there were at least 10 million Hindus in Indonesia.

The growth of Hinduism has been driven also by the famous Javanese prophecies of Sabdapalon and Jayabaya. Many recent converts to Hinduism had been members of the families of Sukarno&#x27;s PNI, and now support Megawati Sukarnoputri. This return to the &#x27;religion of Majapahit (Hinduism) is a matter of nationalist pride.

Next to Indonesian Balinese, today, the Balamon Cham are the only surviving native (non-Indic) Hindus in Southeast Asia. In Vietnam there are roughly 160,000 members of the Cham ethnic minority, majority of them adheres to Islam while some are Hindus. After centuries being dominated by Kinh (Vietnamese), today there are some effort to revive Cham culture.

== Countries ==
Hinduism is a minority religion of Southeast Asia with a sizeable population in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Myanmar. Indonesia has the fourth largest hindu population of the world.Majorly in the bali island

===Brunei===
Through allegiance to the Majapahit Empire Hinduism was widely influenced and adopted by the locals. Later during the 15th century, Arabs invaded Brunei therefore ending Hindu rule due to forced conversions and mass persecution of the citizens.

===Cambodia===

Cambodia was first influenced by Hinduism during the beginning of the Kingdom of Funan. Hinduism was one of the Khmer Empire&#x27;s official religions. Angkor Wat, the largest temple complex in the world (now Buddhist) was once a Hindu temple. The main religion adhered to in Khmer kingdom was Hinduism, followed by Buddhism in popularity. Initially, the kingdom followed Hinduism as its main state religion.

The Mahadeva&#x27;s Vishnu and Shiva were the most revered deities worshipped in Khmer Hindu temples. Temples such as Angkor Wat are actually known as &quot;Preah Pisnulok&quot; (&quot;Vara Vishnuloka&quot; in Sanskrit) or the realm of Vishnu, to honour the posthumous King Suryavarman II as Vishnu. Hindu ceremonies and rituals performed by Brahmins (Hindu priests), typically only remained among the ruling elites of the king&#x27;s family, nobles, and the ruling class.

The Khmer Empire has developed a complex society where sophisticated culture, art, and architecture flourish. The Khmer king and his officials were in charge of irrigation management and water distribution, which consisted of an intricate series of hydraulics infrastructure, such as canals, moats, and massive reservoirs called &quot;barays&quot;. Society was arranged in a hierarchy reflecting the Hindu caste system, where the commoners – rice farmers and fishermen – formed the large majority of the population. The kshatriyas – royalty, nobles, warlords, soldiers, and warriors – formed a governing elite and authorities. Other social classes included brahmins (priests), traders, artisans such as carpenters and stonemasons, potters, metalworkers, goldsmiths, and textile weavers, while on the lowest social level are slaves. The extensive irrigation projects provided rice surpluses that could support a large population. The state religion was Hinduism but influenced by the cult of Devaraja, elevating the Khmer kings as possessing the divine quality of living gods on earth, attributed to the incarnation of Vishnu or Shiva. In politics, this status was viewed as the divine justification of a king&#x27;s rule. The cult enabled the Khmer kings to embark on massive architectural projects, constructing majestic monuments such as Angkor Wat and Bayon to celebrate the king&#x27;s divine rule on earth.

The empire&#x27;s official religions included Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism until Theravada Buddhism prevailed, even among the lower classes, after its introduction from Sri Lanka in the 13th century. Since then, Hinduism slowly declined in Cambodia, and finally being replaced by Theravadan Buddhist as the major faith in the kingdom. Despite this, Hindu rituals continue to play an important role in the kingdom. Like in neighboring Thailand, the ceremony of coronation is conducted mostly by royal Brahmins, during which the sovereign swears in front of the idols of gods Vishnu and Shiva to maintain the ancient national traditions.

===Indonesia===


Today in Indonesia, Hinduism is practised by 1.7% of the total population. Hindus constitute 83.29% of the population of Bali and 5.75% of the population of Central Kalimantan, as of the 2010 census. However, between the 4th century to 15th century, Hinduism and Buddhism was adhered by the majority of the population, along with native indigenous animism and dynamism beliefs that venerated natural and ancestral spirits. By 15th to 16th-century Islam had supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism as the majority religion in the Indonesian archipelago. The influence of Hinduism has profoundly left its marks on the culture of Bali, Java, and Sumatra. Bali has become the last remnant of once Hindu dominated region.

Hindu influences reached the Indonesian Archipelago as early as first century. In 4th-century, the kingdom of Kutai in East Kalimantan, Tarumanagara in West Java, and Holing (Kalingga) in Central Java, were among the early Hindu states established in the region. The notable ancient Indonesian Hindu kingdoms are Mataram Kingdom (famous for the construction of the majestic 9th-century Trimurti Prambanan temple) followed by Kediri, Singhasari and the 14th-century Majapahit, the last and largest among Hindu-Buddhist Javanese empires.

The Hindu civilisations have left their marks on Indonesian culture. The epics &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and &quot;Ramayana&quot;, became enduring traditions among Indonesian art forms, expressed in wayang shadow puppet and dance performances. Many Indonesian names are Sanskrit-based, and Bahasa Indonesia contains loads of loanwords of Sanskrit origin. The vehicle of Vishnu, Garuda, was adopted as both national emblem Garuda Pancasila and flag carrier national airline named Garuda Indonesia.

Today, the Indonesian government has recognised Hinduism as one of the country&#x27;s six officially sanctioned religions, along with Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Buddhism and Confucianism.

The Hindu communities in Java tend to be concentrated around built temples (&quot;pura&quot;) or around archaeological temple sites (&quot;candi&quot;) which are being reclaimed as places of Hindu worship. An important Hindu temple in eastern Java is Pura Mandaragiri Sumeru Agung, located on the slope of Mt. Semeru, Java&#x27;s highest mountain. Another Hindu temple, built on a site with minor archaeological remnants attributed to the Kingdom of Blambangan, the last Hindu polity on Java, and Pura Loka Moksa Jayabaya (in the village of Menang near Kediri), where the Hindu king and prophet Jayabaya is said to have achieved spiritual liberation (&quot;moksa&quot;). Another site is the new Pura Pucak Raung in East Java, which is mentioned in Balinese literature as the place from where Maharishi Markandeya took Hinduism to Bali in the 14th century.

An example of resurgence around major archaeological remains of ancient Hindu temple sites was observed in Trowulan near Mojokerto, the capital of the legendary Hindu empire Majapahit. A local Hindu movement is struggling to gain control of a newly excavated temple building which they wish to see restored as a site of active Hindu worship. The temple is to be dedicated to Gajah Mada, the man attributed with transforming the small Hindu kingdom of Majapahit into an empire. Although there has been a more pronounced history of resistance to Islamization in East Java, Hindu communities are also expanding in Central Java near the ancient Hindu monuments of Prambanan. On 9 to 12 November 2019, the grand &quot;Abhiṣeka&quot; sacred ceremony was performed in this temple compound. This Hindu ritual was held for the first time after 1,163 years after the Prambanan temple was founded on 856. The &quot;Abhiṣeka&quot; ceremony was meant to cleanse, sanctify and purify the temple, thus signify that the temple is not merely an archaeological and tourism site, but also restored to its original function as a focus of Hindu religious activity.

===Laos===
Hinduism makes up less than 0.1% of the population of Laos. Approximately 7,000 People of Laos are Hindus .

Ancient Laos used to be a part of Hindu Khmer Empire. The Wat Phou is one of the last influences of that period. The Laotian adaptation of the Ramayana is called &quot;Phra Lak Phra Lam&quot;.

===Malaysia===

Hinduism is the fourth largest religion in Malaysia. About 1.78 million Malaysian residents (6.3% of the total population) are Hindus, according to 2010 Census of Malaysia.

Most Malaysian Hindus are settled in western parts of Peninsular Malaysia. Indian Hindus and Buddhists began arriving in Malaysia during the ancient and medieval era. A large number of Hindus from South India were brought to Malaysia by British colonial empire during the 19th and 20th century, as indentured labourers to work on coffee and sugarcane plantations and tin mining; later they were deployed in large numbers, along with Chinese Buddhists, on rubber plantations. The British &quot;kangani&quot; system of recruitment, designed to reduce labour turnover and enhance labour stability, encouraged Hindu workers to recruit friends and family from India to work in British operations in Malaysia. The &quot;kangani&quot; system brought numerous Tamil Hindus into Malaysia by early 1900s. By 1950s, about 12.8% of Malaysian population professed to be a Hindu.

After Malaysia gained its independence from British colonial empire in 1957, it declared its official state religion as Islam and adopted a discriminatory constitution as well as the Sedition Act of 1971 which limited public debate on Malaysia&#x27;s treatment of religion, language and citizenship policies. In recent decades, there have been increasing reports of religious persecution of Hindus, along with other minority religions, by various state governments of Malaysia and its Sharia courts. Hindu temples built on private property, and built long before Malaysian independence, have been demolished by Malaysian government officials in recent years. Since the 1970s, there has been large scale emigration of Hindus (along with Buddhists and Christians) from Malaysia.

Malaysian Hindus celebrate Deepavali (festival of lights), Thaipusam (Lord Murugan festival), Pongal (harvest festival) and Navaratri (Durga festival).

===Myanmar===

Hinduism in Burma is practised by about 840,000 people, though a reliable census data is unavailable Most Hindus in Myanmar are Burmese Indians. In modern Myanmar, most Hindus are found in the urban centres of Yangon and Mandalay. Ancient Hindu temples are present in other parts of Burma, such as the 11th century Nathlaung Kyaung Temple dedicated to Vishnu in Bagan. Hinduism in Myanmar has also been influenced by Buddhism with many Hindu temples in Myanmar housing statues of the Buddha.

Aspects of Hinduism continue in Burma today, even in the majority Buddhist culture. For example, Thagyamin is worshipped whose origins are in the Hindu god Indra. Burmese literature has also been enriched by Hinduism, including the Burmese adaptation of the Ramayana, called Yama Zatdaw. Many Hindu gods are likewise worshipped by many Burmese people, such as Saraswati (known as Thuyathadi in Burmese), the goddess of knowledge, who is often worshipped before examinations; Shiva is called &quot;Paramizwa&quot;; Vishnu is called &quot;Withano&quot;, and others. Many of these ideas are part of thirty-seven Nat or deities found in Burmese culture.

===Philippines===

Before the arrival of Islam in Sulu in 1450 and Christianity with Ferdinand Magellan, who sailed from Spain in 1521, the chiefs of many communities across the islands were called &quot;Rajas&quot;, and the script was derived from Brahmi. The concept of karma is readily understood across various Philippine peoples as part of the traditional worldview, and derived concepts exist such as &quot;kalma&quot; in Pampangan language, and Gabâ in Visayan languages. The names of precolonial deities, such as Bathala, ultimately come from Hinduism as do many other religious terms and ideas, even as most Filipinos today are Christian. The vocabulary of all Philippine languages reflect different degrees of Hindu influence.

The number of followers of Hinduism today stand at 0.3% of the Philippine population at 34,634

Today, there is a Hindu temple (attended mostly by Sindhīs) on Mahatma Gandhi Street, and the Khalsa Diwan Indian Sikh Temple gurdwāra on United Nations Avenue. Both are in the traditionally Indian enclaves of Paco and Pandacan, two districts of the City of Manila, and are some 15 minutes away from each other by foot. There are currently around 22 gurdwāras nationwide, with most congregants being Indians, Sri Lankans and Nepalese. There are also various Hare Krishna groups in the country that are gaining in popularity, as well as the presence of Ananda Marga and Brahma Kumaris communities, among others.

===Singapore===

The introduction of Hinduism to Singapore dates back to the early 10th century, during the Chola period. Immigrants from Southern India, mostly Tamils, arrived as labourers for the British East India Company, bringing with them their religion and culture. Their arrival saw the building of Dravidian temples throughout the island, and the beginnings of a vibrant Hindu culture. The first temple is Sri Mariamman Temple in Singapore&#x27;s Chinatown. There are currently about thirty main temples in Singapore, dedicated to various gods and goddesses from the Hindu pantheon. Today, two government bodies deal with Hindu affairs: The Hindu Endowments Board and The Hindu Advisory Board.

Hindus are a minority in Singapore, comprising about 10.1 percent of its citizens and permanent residents in 2010. Among 15 years or older population, there were about 558,000 Hindus; 37% of all Hindus in Singapore speak Tamil at home, another 42% speak English. Deepavali is a major Hindu festival and a public holiday observed in Singapore.

===Thailand===

A number of Hindus remain in Thailand, mostly in cities. In the past, the nation came under the influence of the Khmer Empire, which had strong Hindu roots. Despite the fact that today Thailand is a Buddhist majority nation, many elements of Thai culture and symbolism demonstrates Hindu influences and heritage. For example, the popular epic, &quot;Ramakien&quot;, is based on the Ramayana. The Emblem of Thailand depicts Garuda, the &quot;vahana&quot; (vehicle) of Vishnu.

The Thai city, Ayutthaya near Bangkok, is named after Ayodhya, the birthplace of Rama. Numerous rituals derived from Brahmanism are preserved in rituals, such as the use of holy strings and pouring of water from conch shells. Furthermore, Hindu deities are worshipped by many Thais alongside Buddhism, such as Brahma at the famous Erawan Shrine, and statues of Ganesh, Indra, and Shiva, as well as numerous symbols relating to Hindu deities are found, e.g., Garuda, a symbol of the monarchy. Reliefs in temple walls, such as the 12th-century &quot;Prasat Sikhoraphum&quot; in Surin Province, show a dancing Shiva, with smaller images of Parvati, Vishnu, Brahma and Ganesha.

The Devasathan is a Hindu temple established in 1784 by King Rama I. The temple is the centre of Brahminism in Thailand. The royal court Brahmins operate the temple, they perform several royal ceremonies per year.

An annual Giant Swing ceremony known as &quot;Triyampavai-Tripavai&quot; was held in major cities of Thailand until 1935, when it was abolished for safety reasons. The name of the ceremony was derived from the names of two Tamil language Hindu chants: &quot;Thiruvempavai&quot; and &quot;Thiruppavai&quot;. It is known that Tamil verses from &quot;Thiruvempavai&quot; — &quot;poet pratu sivalai&quot; (&quot;opening the portals of Shiva&#x27;s home&quot;) — were recited at this ceremony, as well as the coronation ceremony of the Thai king. According to T.P. Meenakshisundaram, the name of the festival indicates that Thiruppavai might have been recited as well. The swinging ceremony depicted a legend about how the god created the world. Outside shops, particularly in towns and rural areas, statues of Nang Kwak as the deity of wealth, fortune and prosperity (version of Lakshmi) are found.

The elite, and the royal household, often employ Brahmins to mark funerals and state ceremonies such as the Royal Ploughing Ceremony to ensure a good harvest. The importance of Hinduism cannot be denied, even though much of the rituals has been combined with Buddhism.

According to the Thai Census of 2005, there are 52,631 Hindus living in Thailand, making up just 0.09% of the total population.

===Vietnam===

The first recorded religion of the Champa was a form of Shaiva Hinduism, brought by sea from India. Hinduism was an important religion among the Cham people (along with Buddhism, Islam, and indigenous beliefs) until the sixteenth century. Numerous temples dedicated to Shiva were constructed in the central part of what is now Vietnam. The mainly Hindu Óc Eo archeological site in Mekong River Delta in southern Vietnam, dates back to the 7th century and earlier. The Champa civilisation was located in the more southern part of what is today Central Vietnam, and was a highly Indianized Hindu Kingdom, practising a form of Shaivite Hinduism brought by sea from India. Mỹ Sơn, a Hindu temple complex in central Vietnam built by the Cham people is still standing albeit in ruins in Quảng Nam Province, in Vietnam. Since the 15th century under the growing Vietnamese kingdom from the north, Champa was conquered and reduced as a polity. The Chams were subsequently absorbed by the Vietnamese and today are recognised as one of the many ethnic minorities of Vietnam .

The &quot;Chams Balamon&quot; (Hindu Brahmin Chams) form a minority of the Cham population in Vietnam while most of the Chams are known to follow Islam and are known as &quot;Cham Bani&quot;. The term Balamon is considered to have been derived from Brahmin, however, another study suggests that 70% are considered to descend from the Nagavamshi Kshatriya caste (pronounced in Cham(?) as &quot;Satrias&quot;), and claim to be the descendants of the Champa Empire. In any case a sizeable proportion of the Balamon Hindu Cham are considered Brahmins.

Hindu temples are called &quot;Bimong&quot; in the Cham language and the priests are called &quot;Halau Tamunay Ahier&quot;.

The exact number of Hindus in Vietnam are not published in Government census, but there are estimated to be at least 10,000 Balamon Hindus, with another 4,000 Hindus living in Ho Chi Minh City; most of whom are of Indian (Tamil) or of mixed Indian-Vietnamese descent. The Mariamman Temple is one of the most notable Tamil Hindu temples in Ho Chi Minh City. Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan Provinces are where most of the Cham ethnic group (≈65%) in Vietnam reside according to the last population census. Cham Balamon (Hindu Cham) in Ninh Thuan numbered 7,000 in 2002 inhabiting 6 of 34 Cham villages. If this population composition is typical for the Balamon Cham population of Vietnam as a whole then approximately 10% of Balamon Chams in Vietnam are Hindu.

Hinduism is practised by the Balamon Cham people of Vietnam, particularly in the Ninh Thuan province (10.4%) and Binh Thuan (4.8%).

<doc id="307365" wikidata="Q1079293" url="?curid=307365" title="Hindu philosophy">
<text>Hindu philosophy or Vedic philosophy is the set of philosophical systems that developed in tandem with the first Hindu religious traditions during the iron and classical ages of India. In Indian philosophy, of which Hindu philosophy is a prominent subset, the word used for philosophy is Darshana (Sanskrit: दर्शन; meaning: &quot;viewpoint or perspective&quot;), from the Sanskrit root &#x27;दृश&#x27; () meaning &#x27;to see, to experience&#x27;.

The schools of thought or &quot;Darshanas&quot; within Hindu philosophy largely equate to the six ancient orthodox schools: the &quot;āstika&quot; (Sanskrit : आस्तिक) schools, defined by their acceptance of the Vedas, the oldest collection of Sanskrit texts, as an authoritative source of knowledge. Of these six, Samkhya (सांख्य) is the earliest school of dualism; Yoga (योग) combines the metaphysics of Samkhya with meditation and breath techniques; Nyaya (न्याय) is a school of logic emphasising direct realism; Vaisheshika (वैषेशिक) is an offshoot of Nyaya concerned with atomism and naturalism; Mimamsa (मीमांसा) is a school justifying ritual, faith, and religious obligations; and Vedanta (वेदान्त) contains various traditions that mostly embrace nondualism.

Indian philosophy during the ancient and medieval periods also yielded philosophical systems that share concepts with the &quot;āstika&quot; traditions but reject the Vedas. These have been called [[Hindu philosophy|&#x27; (heterodox or non-orthodox) philosophies, and they include: [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Charvaka]], [[Ājīvika|Ajivika]], and others, which are thus broadly classified under Indian but not Hindu philosophy. Western scholars have debated the relationship and differences within &quot;āstika&quot; philosophies and with the &quot;nāstika&quot; philosophies, starting with the writings of [[Indology|Indologists]] and [[Orientalism|Orientalists]] of the 18th and 19th centuries, based on limited availability of Indian literature and medieval [[Doxography|doxographies]]. The various sibling traditions included in Indian philosophies are diverse and are united by: shared history and concepts, textual resources, [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Soteriology|soteriological]] focus, and cosmology. Some heterodox (&quot;nāstika&quot;) traditions such as [[Charvaka]] are often considered as distinct schools within Hindu philosophy because the word [[Hindus|&quot;Hindu&quot;]] is an [[Endonym and exonym|exonym]] historically used as a geographical and cultural identifier for people living in the [[Indian subcontinent]].

Hindu philosophy also includes several sub-schools of theistic philosophies that integrate ideas from two or more of the six orthodox philosophies. Examples of such schools include: [[Pashupata Shaivism|Pāśupata Śaiva]], [[Shaiva Siddhanta|Śaiva siddhānta]], [[Pratyabhijna|Pratyabhijña]], [[Raseśvara]] and [[Vaishnavism|Vaiṣṇava]]. Some sub-schools share Tantric ideas with those found in some Buddhist traditions, which are nevertheless found in the [[Puranas]] and the [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Āgamas]]. Each school of Hindu philosophy has extensive [[Epistemology|epistemological]] literature called &quot;[[Pramana]]&quot;, as well as theories on [[metaphysics]], [[axiology]], and other topics.

==Classifications==

In the [[history of India]], the six orthodox schools had emerged before the start of the [[Common Era]], and some schools emerged possibly even before the [[Buddha]]. Some scholars have questioned whether the orthodox and heterodox schools classification is sufficient or accurate, given the diversity and evolution of views within each major school of Indian philosophy, with some sub-schools combining heterodox and orthodox views.

Since ancient times, Indian philosophy has been categorised into and schools of thought. The orthodox schools of Indian philosophy have been called (&#x27;six systems&#x27;). This schema was created between the 12th and 16th centuries by [[Vedanta|Vedantins]]. It was then adopted by the early Western [[indology|Indologists]], and pervades modern understandings of Indian philosophy.

===Āstika===
There are six (orthodox) schools of thought. Each is called a [[darśana]], and each darśana accepts the [[Vedas]] as authority. Each also accepts the premise that &quot;[[atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]&quot; (eternal Self) exists. The schools of philosophy are:
# [[Samkhya]] – A strongly dualist theoretical exposition of [[Purusha|consciousness]] (&quot;purusha&quot;) and [[Prakṛti|matter]] (&quot;prakriti&quot;). Agnostic with respect to God or the gods.
# [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] – A monotheistic school which emerged from Samkhya and emphasises practical use of Samkhya theory: [[Dhyana in Hinduism|meditation]], [[Samadhi|contemplation]] and [[Kaivalya|liberation]].
# [[Nyaya]] or [[Indian logic|logic]] – The school of epistemology which explores [[pramana|sources of knowledge]]. 
# [[Vaisheshika]] – An [[empiricism|empiricist]] school of [[atomism]].
# [[Mīmāṃsā]] – An anti-ascetic and anti-mysticist school of [[orthopraxy]]. This tradition is also known as Pūrva-Mīmāṁsā because of its focus on the earlier (&quot;pūrva&quot;) [[Vedas|Vedic texts]] dealing with ritual actions, and similarly also known as Karma-Mīmāṁsā due to its focus on ritual action (&quot;[[karma]]&quot;).
# [[Vedanta]] – They focus on the last segment of knowledge in the Vedas, or (&#x27;section of knowledge&#x27;). Vedanta is also referred to as &quot;Uttara-Mimamsa&quot;. Vedānta came to be the dominant current of [[Hinduism]] in the post-medieval period. This school considers the [[Upanishads]], the [[Brahma Sutras]], and the [[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagvad Gita]] as authoritative texts.

===Nāstika===

Schools that do not accept the authority of the Vedas are nāstika philosophies, of which four (heterodox) schools are prominent:
# [[Charvaka]], a materialism school that accepted the existence of free will.
# [[Ājīvika]], a materialism school that denied the existence of free will.
# [[Buddhism]], a philosophy that denies existence of [[ātman (Buddhism)|ātman]] (Self) and is based on the teachings and enlightenment of [[Gautama Buddha]].
# [[Jainism]], a philosophy that accepts the existence of the ātman (Self), and is based on the teachings and enlightenment of twenty-four teachers known as [[tirthankara]]s, with [[Rishabha]] as the first and [[Mahavira]] as the twenty-fourth.

===Other schools===
Besides the major orthodox and non-orthodox schools, there have existed syncretic sub-schools that have combined ideas and introduced new ones of their own. The medieval scholar [[Madhvacharya|Madhavacharya]], identified by some as [[Vidyaranya]], in his book &#x27;[[Sarva-Darsana-Sangraha]]&#x27;, includes [[Sarva-Darsana-Sangraha#Chapters|16 philosophical systems]] current as of 14th century. Along with some of the major orthodox and non-orthodox schools and sub-schools, it includes the following sub-schools:
* [[Pashupata Shaivism]], developed by Nakulisa
* [[Shaiva Siddhanta]], the theistic Sankhya school
* [[Pratyabhijna|Pratyabhijña]], the recognitive school of [[Kashmir Shaivism]], [[Trika]]
* [[Raseśvara]], a Shaiva school that advocated the use of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] to reach immortality
* The [[Pāṇini|Pāṇinīya]]

The above sub-schools introduced their own ideas while adopting concepts from orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy such as realism of the Nyāya, naturalism of Vaiśeṣika, monism and knowledge of Self (Atman) as essential to liberation of Advaita, self-discipline of Yoga, asceticism and elements of theistic ideas. Some sub-schools share Tantric ideas with those found in some Buddhist traditions.

==Characteristics==

==Overview==
===Epistemology===

[[Epistemology]] is called [[pramana]]. It has been a key, much debated field of study in Hinduism since ancient times. is a Hindu theory of knowledge and discusses the valid means by which human beings can gain accurate knowledge. The focus of is how correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows, how one does not, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired.

Ancient and medieval Hindu texts identify six as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths: 
# – Direct perception 
# – Inference or indirect perception
# – Comparison and analogy 
# – Postulation, derivation from circumstances 
# – Non-perception, absence of proof 
# – Word, testimony of past or present reliable experts

Each of these are further categorised in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error, by the different schools. The schools vary on how many of these six are valid paths of knowledge. For example, the [[Charvaka|Cārvāka]] nāstika philosophy holds that only one (perception) is an epistemically reliable means of knowledge, the [[Samkhya]] school holds that three are (perception, inference and testimony), while the Mīmāṃsā and Advaita schools hold that all six are epistemically useful and reliable means to knowledge.

==Sāmkhya==
[[Samkhya|Sāmkhya]]([[Sanskrit]]: सांख्य) is the oldest of the orthodox philosophical systems in [[Hinduism]], with origins in the 1st millennium BCE. It is a [[rationalism|rationalist]] school of [[Indian philosophy]], and had a strong influence on other schools of Indian philosophies. Sāmkhya is an enumerationist philosophy whose [[epistemology]] accepted three of six &quot;[[Pramana|pramāṇas]]&quot; as the only reliable means of gaining knowledge. These were (perception), (inference) and (, word/testimony of reliable sources).

Samkhya school espouses [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualism]] between witness-consciousness and &#x27;nature&#x27; (mind, perception, matter). It regards the universe as consisting of two realities: &quot;[[Purusha|Puruṣa]]&quot; (witness-consciousness) and &quot;[[prakriti]]&quot; (&#x27;nature&#x27;). &quot;[[Jiva]]&quot; (a living being) is that state in which is bonded to in some form. This fusion, state the Samkhya scholars, led to the emergence of (awareness, intellect) and (individualised ego consciousness, &quot;I-maker&quot;). The universe is described by this school as one created by Purusa-Prakriti entities infused with various permutations and combinations of variously enumerated elements, senses, feelings, activity and mind.

Samkhya philosophy includes a theory of [[Guṇa|&quot;gunas&quot;]] (qualities, innate tendencies, psyche). , it states, are of three types: being good, compassionate, illuminating, positive, and constructive; is one of activity, chaotic, passion, impulsive, potentially good or bad; and being the quality of darkness, ignorance, destructive, lethargic, negative. Everything, all life forms and human beings, state Samkhya scholars, have these three , but in different proportions. The interplay of these defines the character of someone or something, of nature and determines the progress of life. Samkhya theorises a pluralism of Selfs () who possess consciousness. Samkhya has historically been theistic or non-theistic, and there has been debate about its specific view on God.

The &quot;[[Samkhyakarika|Samkhya karika]]&quot;, one of the key texts of this school of Hindu philosophy, opens by stating its goal to be &quot;three kinds of human suffering&quot; and means to prevent them. The text then presents a distillation of its theories on epistemology, metaphysics, axiology and soteriology. For example, it states,

The soteriology in Samkhya aims at the realisation of Puruṣa as distinct from Prakriti; this knowledge of the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Self]] is held to end transmigration and lead to absolute freedom ([[kaivalya]]).

==Yōga==

In [[Indian philosophy]], [[Yoga|Yōga]]([[Sanskrit]]: योग) is, among other things, the name of one of the six philosophical schools. The [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] philosophical system aligns closely with the [[dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualist]] premises of the [[Samkhya]] school. The Yoga school accepts Samkhya psychology and metaphysics, but is considered theistic because it accepts the concept of personal god ([[Ishvara]], unlike Samkhya. The [[epistemology]] of the Yoga school, like the Sāmkhya school, relies on three of six as the means of gaining reliable knowledge: (perception), (inference) and (, word/testimony of reliable sources).

The universe is conceptualised as a duality in Yoga school: [[purusha|puruṣa]] (witness-consciousness) and [[prakṛti]] (mind, perception, matter); however, the Yoga school discusses this concept more generically as &quot;seer, experiencer&quot; and &quot;seen, experienced&quot; than the Samkhya school.

A key text of the Yoga school is the &quot;[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]&quot;. [[Patanjali]] may have been, as [[Max Müller]] explains, &quot;the author or representative of the Yoga-philosophy without being necessarily the author of the Sutras.&quot; Hindu philosophy recognises many types of Yoga, such as [[rāja yoga]], [[Jnana yoga|jñāna yoga]], [[karma yoga]], [[bhakti yoga]], [[tantra]] yoga, [[mantra]] yoga, [[Kundalini yoga|laya yoga]], and [[hatha yoga]].

The Yoga school builds on the Samkhya school theory that [[jñāna]] (knowledge) is a sufficient means to moksha. It suggests that systematic techniques/practice (personal experimentation) combined with Samkhya&#x27;s approach to knowledge is the path to moksha. Yoga shares several central ideas with Advaita Vedanta, with the difference that Yoga is a form of experimental mysticism while Advaita Vedanta is a form of [[monism|monistic]] personalism. Like Advaita Vedanta, the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy holds that liberation/freedom in this life is achievable, and that this occurs when an individual fully understands and realises the equivalence of Atman (Self) and Brahman.

==Vaiśeṣika==

The [[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]]([[Sanskrit]]: वैशेसिक) philosophy is a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] school. It is a form of [[atomism]] in natural philosophy. It postulates that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to ([[atom]]s), and that one&#x27;s experiences are derived from the interplay of substance (a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), quality, activity, commonness, particularity and inherence. Knowledge and liberation are achievable by complete understanding of the world of experience, according to Vaiśeṣika school. The Vaiśeṣika is credited to [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kaṇāda Kaśyapa]] from the second half of the first millennium BCE. The foundational text, the &quot;[[Vaiśeṣika Sūtra]]&quot;, opens as follows:

The Vaiśeṣika school is related to the Nyāya school but features differences in its [[epistemology]], metaphysics and ontology. The epistemology of the Vaiśeṣika school, like [[Buddhism]], accepted only two means to knowledge as reliable – perception and inference. The Vaiśeṣika school and Buddhism both consider their respective scriptures as indisputable and valid means to knowledge, the difference being that the scriptures held to be a valid and reliable source by Vaiśeṣikas were the Vedas.

Vaiśeṣika metaphysical premises are founded on a form of atomism, that reality is composed of four substances (earth, water, air, and fire). Each of these four are of two types: atomic () and composite. An atom is, according to Vaiśeṣika scholars, that which is indestructible (), indivisible, and has a special kind of dimension, called &quot;small&quot; (). A composite, in this philosophy, is defined to be anything which is divisible into atoms. Whatever human beings perceive is composite, while atoms are invisible. The Vaiśeṣikas stated that size, form, truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements, their &quot;[[guṇa]]&quot; (quality), &quot;karma&quot; (activity), (commonness), (particularity) and (inherence, inseparable connectedness of everything).

==Nyāya==
The [[Nyaya|Nyāya]]([[Sanskrit]]: न्याय) school is a [[philosophical realism|realist]] āstika philosophy. The school&#x27;s most significant contributions to Indian philosophy were its systematic development of the theory of [[logic]], methodology, and its treatises on epistemology. The foundational text of the Nyāya school is the &quot;[[Nyāya Sūtras]]&quot; of the first millennium BCE. The text is credited to Aksapada Gautama and its composition is variously dated between the sixth and second centuries BCE.

Nyāya epistemology accepts four out of six as reliable means of gaining knowledge – (perception), (inference), (comparison and analogy) and (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).

In its [[metaphysics]], the Nyāya school is closer to the Vaiśeṣika school than the others. It holds that human suffering results from mistakes/defects produced by activity under wrong knowledge (notions and ignorance). Moksha (liberation), it states, is gained through right knowledge. This premise led Nyāya to concern itself with epistemology, that is, the reliable means to gain correct knowledge and to remove wrong notions. False knowledge is not merely ignorance to Naiyayikas; it includes delusion. Correct knowledge is discovering and overcoming one&#x27;s delusions, and understanding the true nature of the soul, self and reality. The Nyāya Sūtras begin:
The Nyāya school uses a three-fold procedure: enumeration, definition, and examination. This procedure of enumeration, definition, and examination is recurrent in [[Navya-Nyāya]] texts like The Manual of Reason ([[Tarka-Sangraha]]).

==Mīmāṃsā==

The [[Mīmāṃsā]]([[Sanskrit]]: मीमांसा) school emphasises religious [[hermeneutics]] and [[exegesis]]. It is a form of [[philosophical realism]]. Key texts of the Mīmāṃsā school are the &quot;[[Purva Mimamsa Sutras]]&quot; of [[Jaimini]]. The classical Mīmāṃsā school is sometimes referred to as or in reference to the first part of the Vedas.

The Mīmāṃsā school has several sub-schools defined by epistemology. The [[Prabhākara|Prābhākara]] subschool of Mīmāṃsā accepted five means to gaining knowledge as epistimetically reliable: (perception), (inference), (comparison and analogy), (postulation, derivation from circumstances), and (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts). The [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]] sub-school of Mīmāṃsā added a sixth way of knowing to its canon of reliable epistemology: (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof).

The metaphysics of the Mīmāṃsā school consists of both [[atheism|atheistic]] and [[theism|theistic]] doctrines, and the school showed little interest in systematic examination of the existence of God. Rather, it held that the Self (Atma) is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active spiritual essence, then focussed on the epistemology and metaphysics of &quot;dharma&quot;. To them, [[dharma]] meant rituals and duties, not [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]] (gods), because devas existed only in name. The Mīmāṃsākas held that the [[Vedas]] are &quot;eternal authorless infallible&quot;, that Vedic (injunctions) and [[mantra]]s in rituals are prescriptive (actions), and that the rituals are of primary importance and merit. They considered the [[Upanishads]] and other texts related to self-knowledge and spirituality to be of secondary importance, a philosophical view that the [[Vedanta]] school disagreed with.

Mīmāṃsā gave rise to the study of [[philology]] and the [[philosophy of language]]. While their deep analysis of language and [[linguistics]] influenced other schools, their views were not shared by others. Mīmāṃsākas considered the purpose and power of language was to clearly &quot;prescribe&quot; the proper, correct and right. In contrast, Vedantins extended the scope and value of language as a tool to also &quot;describe&quot;, &quot;develop&quot; and &quot;derive&quot;. Mīmāṃsākas considered orderly, law-driven, procedural life as the central purpose and noblest necessity of [[dharma]] and society, and divine (theistic) sustenance means to that end. The Mimamsa school was influential and foundational to the Vedanta school, with the difference that Mīmāṃsā developed and emphasises (the portion of the [[śruti]] which relates to ceremonial acts and sacrificial rites, the early parts of the Vedas), while the Vedanta school developed and emphasises (the portion of the Vedas that relates to knowledge of monism, the latter parts of the Vedas).

==Vedānta==

The [[Vedanta|Vedānta]]([[Sanskrit]]: वेदान्त) school built upon the teachings of the Upanishads and [[Brahma Sutras]] from the first millennium BCE and is the most developed and best-known of the Hindu schools. The epistemology of the Vedantins included, depending on the sub-school, five or six methods as proper and reliable means of gaining any form of knowledge: (perception), (inference), (comparison and analogy), (postulation, derivation from circumstances), (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts). All of these have been further categorised by each sub-school of Vedanta in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error.

The emergence of the Vedanta school represented a period in which a more knowledge-centered understanding began to emerge, focusing on (knowledge) driven aspects of the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] and the Upanishads. These included metaphysical concepts such as ātman and [[Brahman]], and an emphasis on meditation, self-discipline, self-knowledge and abstract spirituality, rather than ritualism. The Upanishads were variously interpreted by ancient- and medieval-era Vedanta scholars. Consequently, the Vedanta separated into many sub-schools, ranging from theistic dualism to non-theistic monism, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own series of sub-commentaries.

===Advaita===

&quot;Advaita&quot; literally means &quot;not two, sole, unity&quot;. It is a sub-school of Vedanta, and asserts spiritual and universal non-dualism. Its metaphysics is a form of absolute [[monism]], that is all ultimate reality is interconnected oneness. This is the oldest and most widely acknowledged Vedantic school. The foundational texts of this school are the [[Brahma Sutras]] and the early [[Upanishads]] from the 1st millennium BCE. Its first great consolidator was the 8th century scholar [[Adi Shankara]], who continued the line of thought of the Upanishadic teachers, and that of his teacher&#x27;s teacher [[Gaudapada]]. He wrote extensive commentaries on the major Vedantic scriptures and is celebrated as one of the major Hindu philosophers from whose doctrines the main currents of modern Indian thought are derived.

According to this school of Vedanta, all reality is Brahman, and there exists nothing whatsoever which is not &quot;Brahman&quot;. Its metaphysics includes the concept of [[Maya (illusion)|māyā]] and ātman. connotes &quot;that which exists, but is constantly changing and thus is spiritually unreal&quot;. The empirical reality is considered as always changing and therefore &quot;transitory, incomplete, misleading and not what it appears to be&quot;. The concept of is of one Atman, with the light of Atman reflected within each person as . Advaita Vedantins assert that ātman is same as Brahman, and this Brahman is reflected within each human being and all life, all living beings are spiritually interconnected, and there is oneness in all of existence. They hold that dualities and misunderstanding of as the spiritual reality that matters is caused by ignorance, and are the cause of sorrow, suffering. [[Jivanmukta|&quot;Jīvanmukti&quot;]] (liberation during life) can be achieved through Self-knowledge, the understanding that ātman within is same as in another person and all of Brahman – the eternal, unchanging, entirety of cosmic principles and true reality.

Some believe that Shankara is a &quot;closet Buddhist,&quot; suggesting as evidence his positions that selfhood is illusory and an experience of it disappears after one attains enlightenment. However, Shankara does believe that there is an enduring reality that is ultimately real. He specifically rejects Buddhist propositions in his commentary on Brahma Sutras 2.2.18, 2.2.19, 2.2.20, 2.2.25, among others.

===Viśiṣṭādvaita===

[[Ramanuja]] (c. 1037–1137) was the foremost proponent of the philosophy of Viśiṣṭādvaita or qualified non-dualism. Viśiṣṭādvaita advocated the concept of a Supreme Being with essential qualities or attributes. Viśiṣṭādvaitins argued against the Advaitin conception of Brahman as an impersonal empty oneness. They saw Brahman as an eternal oneness, but also as the source of all creation, which was omnipresent and actively involved in existence. To them the sense of subject-object perception was illusory and a sign of ignorance. However, the individual&#x27;s sense of self was not a complete illusion since it was derived from the universal beingness that is Brahman. Ramanuja saw [[Vishnu]] as a personification of Brahman.

The Viśiṣṭādvaita sub-school also disagrees with the Advaita claim that misconception (&quot;avidyā&quot;) is indescribable as either real or unreal (&quot;anirvacanīya&quot;). It sees this as a contradiction, and argues that &quot;avidyā&quot; must either be non-different from Brahman or different from Brahman. If it is different from Brahman, the non-dualist position of Shankara is given up, but if it is non-different, it must exist ultimately as Brahman. Ramanuja claims that &quot;avidyā&quot; cannot be identical with Brahman because Brahman is pure knowledge, and &quot;avidyā&quot; is absence of knowledge. Ramanuja also argues that the Advaita position cannot coherently maintain that Brahman is non-intentional consciousness (consciousness that does not have an object), because all cognitions are necessarily about something.

===Dvaita===
[[Dvaita]] refers to a theistic sub-school in [[Vedanta]] tradition of Hindu philosophy. Also called and , the Dvaita sub-school was founded by the 13th-century scholar [[Madhvacharya]]. The Dvaita Vedanta school believes that [[God]] (Vishnu, [[Paramatman]]) and the individual Selfs (Atman) ([[jiva|jīvātman]]) exist as independent realities, and these are distinct.

Dvaita Vedanta is a dualistic interpretation of the [[Vedas]]; it espouses dualism by theorising the existence of two separate realities. The first and the only independent reality, states the Dvaita school, is that of [[Vishnu]] or Brahman. Vishnu is the [[Paramatman]], in a manner similar to monotheistic God in other major religions. The distinguishing factor of Dvaita philosophy, as opposed to monistic [[Advaita Vedanta]], is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe. Like [[Vishishtadvaita]] Vedanta sub-school, Dvaita philosophy also embraced [[Vaishnavism]], with the metaphysical concept of Brahman in the Vedas identified with Vishnu and the one and only [[God|Supreme Being]]. However, unlike Vishishtadvaita which envisions ultimate qualified nondualism, the dualism of Dvaita was permanent. Dvaita sub-school disagrees with the Vishishtadvaita claim that Brahman is linked with the individual self and the world in the way that a soul is with its body. Madhvacharya argues that Brahman cannot be the material cause of the world.

[[Moksha|Salvation]], in Dvaita, is achievable only through the grace of God Vishnu.

===Dvaitādvaita (Bhedabheda)===
[[Svabhavika Bhedabheda|Dvaitādvaita]] was proposed by [[Nimbarkacharya]], a 7th-century Vaishnava philosopher from the Andhra region which was further propounded by his disciple [[Srinivasacharya]]. According to this philosophy there are three categories of existence: Brahman, Self, and matter. Self and matter are different from Brahman in that they have attributes and capacities different from Brahman. Brahman exists independently, while Self and matter are dependent. Thus Self and matter have an existence that is separate yet dependent. Further, Brahman is a controller, the Self is the enjoyer, and matter the thing enjoyed. Also, the highest object of worship is [[Krishna]] and his consort [[Radha]], attended by thousands of &quot;[[gopi]]s&quot;; of the [[Vrindavan]]; and devotion consists in self-surrender.

===Śuddhādvaita===
[[Shuddhadvaita|Śuddhādvaita]] is the &quot;purely non-dual&quot; philosophy propounded by [[Vallabha Acharya]] (1479–1531). The founding philosopher was also the guru of the Vallabhā [[sampradaya|sampradāya]] (&quot;tradition of Vallabh&quot;) or [[Pushtimarg|&quot;Puṣṭimārga&quot;]], a Vaishnava tradition focused on the worship of Krishna. [[Vallabhacharya]] enunciates that Brahman has created the world without connection with any external agency such as Māyā (which itself is His power) and manifests Himself through the world. That is why [[Shuddhadvaita]] is known as &quot;Unmodified transformation&quot; or &quot;Avikṛta Pariṇāmavāda&quot;. Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual Selfs and the world. The Jagat or Maya is not false or illusionary, the physical material world is. Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and the individual as a &quot;part&quot; (but devoid of bliss) like sparks and fire. This sub-school thus denies the Advaita conception of Maya because the world is considered to be real insofar as it is non-different from Brahman, who is believed to be Krishna.

===Acintya Bheda Abheda===

[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (1486–1534), stated that the Self or energy of God is both distinct and non-distinct from God, whom he identified as Krishna, [[Govinda]], and that this, although unthinkable, may be experienced through a process of loving devotion (&quot;[[bhakti]]&quot;). He followed the Dvaita concept of Madhvacharya. In accordance with the Vishnu Purana, this sub-school ascribes six virtues to God (Bhagavan): power (&quot;aishvarya&quot;), potency (&quot;virya&quot;), fame (&quot;yasha&quot;), prosperity (&quot;shri&quot;), knowledge (&quot;jnana&quot;), and renunciation (&quot;vairagya&quot;). The potency of Bhagavan, which is transcendental, is not conceivable to humans and its relationship to Bhagwan is characterised as one in which there is &quot;inconceivable difference in non-difference&quot; (&quot;acintya-bhedabheda&quot;). This potency has divisions that are described within Jiva Gosvami&#x27;s &quot;Bhagavat Sandarbha&quot;, which comments on the internal potency, and &quot;Paramatma Sandarbha&quot;, which elaborates the marginal and external potencies of Bhagavan. Maya, which is central to &quot;advaita&quot;, is the external potency of Bhagavan, which is controlled by &quot;Paramatma&quot;, an expansion of Bhagavan. And, Brahman is included within Bhagavan, who is the object of meditation and realisation for bhakti-yogis.

=== Akshar-Purushottam Darshan ===
==Cārvāka==

The [[Charvaka|Cārvāka]]([[Sanskrit]]: चार्वाक) school is one of the [[Āstika and nāstika|nāstika]] or &quot;heterodox&quot; philosophies . It rejects supernaturalism, emphasises [[materialism]] and [[philosophical skepticism]], holding empiricism, perception and conditional inference as the proper source of knowledge Cārvāka is an [[atheism|atheistic]] school of thought. It holds that there is neither afterlife nor rebirth, all existence is mere combination of atoms and substances, feelings and mind are an epiphenomenon, and free will exists.

Bṛhaspati is sometimes referred to as the founder of Cārvāka (also called Lokayata) philosophy. Much of the primary literature of Cārvāka, the [[Barhaspatya sutras]] (ca. 600 BCE), however, are missing or lost. Its theories and development has been compiled from historic secondary literature such as those found in the [[shastra]]s, [[sutra]]s and the [[Indian epic poetry]] as well as from the texts of [[Buddhism]] and from [[Jain literature]]. The by the skeptic philosopher [[Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa]] has been considered by many scholars to be an unorthodox Cārvāka text.

One of the widely studied principles of Cārvāka philosophy was its rejection of [[inference]] as a means to establish valid, universal knowledge, and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] truths. In other words, the Cārvāka epistemology states that whenever one infers a truth from a set of observations or truths, one must acknowledge doubt; inferred knowledge is conditional.

==Shaivism==

Early history of Shaivism is difficult to determine. However, the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad|&quot; Upanishad&quot;]] (400 – 200 BCE) is considered to be the earliest textual exposition of a systematic philosophy of Shaivism. Shaivism is represented by various philosophical schools, including non-dualist (), dualist (), and non-dualist-with-dualist (&quot;&quot;) perspectives. [[Vidyaranya]] in his works mentions three major schools of Shaiva thought: [[Pashupata Shaivism]], [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] and Pratyabhijña ([[Kashmir Shaivism]]).

===Pāśupata Shaivism===
Pāśupata Shaivism (, &#x27;of Paśupati&#x27;) is the oldest of the major Shaiva schools. The philosophy of Pashupata sect was systematised by &quot;[[Lakulish]]&quot; in the 2nd century CE. &quot;Paśu&quot; in [[Pashupati|Paśupati]] refers to the effect (or created world), the word designates that which is dependent on something ulterior. Whereas, Pati means the cause (or ), the word designates the Lord, who is the cause of the universe, the , or the ruler. Pashupatas disapproved of Vaishnava theology, known for its doctrine servitude of Selfs to the Supreme Being, on the grounds that dependence upon anything could not be the means of cessation of pain and other desired ends. They recognised that those depending upon another and longing for independence will not be emancipated because they still depend upon something other than themselves. According to Pāśupatas, Self possesses the attributes of the Supreme Deity when it becomes liberated from the &#x27;germ of every pain&#x27;.

Pāśupatas divided the created world into the insentient and the sentient. The insentient was the unconscious and thus dependent on the sentient or conscious. The insentient was further divided into effects and causes. The effects were of ten kinds, the earth, [[Classical element|four elements]] and their qualities, colour etc. The causes were of thirteen kinds, the five organs of cognition, the five organs of action, the three internal organs, intellect, the ego principle and the cognising principle. These insentient causes were held responsible for the illusive identification of Self with non-Self. Salvation in Pāśupata involved the union of the Self with God through the intellect.

===Shaiva Siddhanta===
Considered normative [[Tantra|Tantric]] Shaivism, Shaiva Siddhanta provides the normative rites, cosmology and theological categories of Tantric Shaivism. Being a dualistic philosophy, the goal of Shaiva Siddhanta is to become an ontologically distinct Shiva (through Shiva&#x27;s grace). This tradition later merged with the Tamil Saiva movement and expression of concepts of Shaiva Siddhanta can be seen in the bhakti poetry of the [[Nayanars]].

===Kashmir Shaivism===
Kashmir Shaivism arose during the eighth or ninth century CE in [[Kashmir]] and made significant strides, both philosophical and theological, until the end of the twelfth century CE. It is categorised by various scholars as [[monistic]] [[idealism]] ([[absolute idealism]], theistic monism, realistic idealism, transcendental physicalism or concrete monism). It is a school of [[Śaivism]] consisting of [[Trika]] and its philosophical articulation Pratyabhijña.

Even though, both Kashmir Shaivism and Advaita Vedanta are non-dual philosophies which give primacy to Universal Consciousness ( or &quot;Brahman&quot;), in Kashmir Shavisim, as opposed to Advaita, all things are a manifestation of this Consciousness. This implies that from the point of view of Kashmir Shavisim, the phenomenal world () is real, and it exists and has its being in Consciousness (). However, Advaita holds that Brahman is the reality (pure consciousness) and it is inactive () and the phenomenal world is an appearance (). The objective of human life, according to Kashmir Shaivism, is to merge in Shiva or Universal Consciousness, or to realise one&#x27;s already existing identity with Shiva, by means of wisdom, yoga and grace.

<doc id="307366" wikidata="Q651387" url="?curid=307366" title="Vaisheshika">
<text>Vaisheshika (IAST: Vaiśeṣika; ; ) is one of the six schools of Hindu philosophy from ancient India. In its early stages, Vaiśeṣika was an independent philosophy with its own metaphysics, epistemology, logic, ethics, and soteriology. Over time, the Vaiśeṣika system became similar in its philosophical procedures, ethical conclusions and soteriology to the Nyāya school of Hinduism, but retained its difference in epistemology and metaphysics.

The epistemology of the Vaiśeṣika school of Hinduism, like Buddhism, accepted only two reliable means to knowledge: direct observation and inference. The Vaiśeṣika school and Buddhism both consider their respective scriptures as indisputable and valid means to knowledge, the difference being that the scriptures held to be a valid and reliable source by Vaiśeṣikas were the Vedas.

The Vaiśeṣika school is known for its insights in naturalism, a form of atomism in natural philosophy. It postulated that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to &quot;paramāṇu&quot; (atoms), and one&#x27;s experiences are derived from the interplay of substance (a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), quality, activity, commonness, particularity and inherence. Everything was composed of atoms, qualities emerged from aggregates of atoms, but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces. Ājīvika metaphysics included a theory of atoms which was later adapted in the Vaiśeṣika school.

According to the Vaiśeṣika school, knowledge and liberation were achievable by a complete understanding of the world of experience.

Vaiśeṣika darshana was founded by Kaṇāda Kashyapa around the 6th to 2nd century BC.

==Overview==
The name Vaiśeṣika derives from &quot;viśeṣa&quot;, the category that represents the individuality of innumerable existing objects.

Although the Vaiśeṣika system developed independently from the Nyāya philosophy of Hinduism, the two became similar and are often studied together. However, in its classical form, the Vaiśeṣika school differed from Nyāya in a significant way: where Nyāya accepted four sources of valid knowledge, the Vaiśeṣika accepted only two.

The epistemology of Vaiśeṣika school of Hinduism accepted only two reliable means to knowledge – perception and inference.

Vaisheshika espouses a form of atomism, that the reality is composed of five substances (examples are earth, water, air, fire, and space). Each of these five are of two types, explains Ganeri: &quot;paramāṇu&quot; and composite. A paramāṇu is that which is indestructible, indivisible, and has a special kind of dimension, called &quot;small&quot; (aṇu). A composite is that which is divisible into paramāṇu. Whatever human beings perceive is composite, and even the smallest perceptible thing, namely, a fleck of dust, has parts, which are therefore invisible. The Vaiśeṣikas visualized the smallest composite thing as a &quot;triad&quot; (tryaṇuka) with three parts, each part with a &quot;dyad&quot; (dyaṇuka). Vaiśeṣikas believed that a dyad has two parts, each of which is an atom. Size, form, truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of parmanus, their number and their spatial arrangements.

&quot;Parama&quot; means &quot;most distant, remotest, extreme, last&quot; and &quot;aṇu&quot; means &quot;atom, very small particle&quot;, hence &quot;paramāṇu&quot; is essentially &quot;the most distant or last small (i.e. smallest) particle&quot;.

Vaiśeṣika postulated that what one experiences is derived from &quot;dravya&quot; (substance: a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), &quot;guna&quot; (quality), &quot;karma&quot; (activity), &quot;samanya&quot; (commonness), &quot;vishesha&quot; (particularity) and &quot;samavaya&quot; (inherence, inseparable connectedness of everything).

The followers of this philosophy are mostly Shaivas. Acharya Haribhadra Suri, in his work &quot;Ṣaḍdarśanasamuccaya&quot; describes the followers of Vaiśeṣika as worshippers of Pashupati or Shiva.

==Development==

=== Foundational Text ===
The earliest systematic exposition of the Vaisheshika is found in the  of (or ). Kanada is also referred to as Uluka by Ci-tsan, a Chinese Buddhist commentator. This treatise is divided into ten books. 

=== Commentaries ===
The two commentaries on the , and are no more extant. ’s (c. 4th century) is the next important work of this school. Though commonly known as of , this treatise is basically an independent work on the subject. The next Vaisheshika treatise, Candra’s (648) based on ’s treatise is available only in Chinese translation. The earliest commentary available on ’s treatise is ’s (8th century). The other three commentaries are ’s (991), Udayana’s (10th century) and ’s (11th century). ’s which also belongs to the same period, presents the and the principles as a part of one whole. ’s Upaskara on is also an important work.

==Metaphysics==

=== The Categories or &quot;Padārtha&quot; ===
According to the Vaisheshika school, all things that exist, that can be cognized and named are s (literal meaning: the meaning of a word), the objects of experience. All objects of experience can be classified into six categories, &quot;dravya&quot; (substance), (quality), &quot;karma&quot; (activity), (generality), (particularity) and (inherence). Later s ( and Udayana and ) added one more category &quot;abhava&quot; (non-existence). The first three categories are defined as &quot;artha&quot; (which can perceived) and they have real objective existence. The last three categories are defined as (product of intellectual discrimination) and they are logical categories.

# &quot;Dravya&quot; (substance): There are nine substances. They are, (earth), &quot;ap&quot; (water), &quot;tejas&quot; (fire), (air), (ether), (time), &quot;dik&quot; (space), (self or soul) and &quot;manas&quot; (mind). The first five are called s, the substances having some specific qualities so that they could be perceived by one or the other external senses.
# &quot;Guṇa&quot; (quality): The mentions 17 s (qualities), to which added another 7. While a substance is capable of existing independently by itself, a (quality) cannot exist so. The original 17 s (qualities) are, (colour), &quot;rasa&quot; (taste), &quot;gandha&quot; (smell), (touch), (number), (size/dimension/quantity), (individuality), (conjunction/accompaniments), (disjunction), &quot;&quot; (priority), &quot;aparatva&quot; (posteriority), &quot;buddhi&quot; (knowledge), &quot;sukha&quot; (pleasure), (pain), (desire), (aversion) and &quot;prayatna&quot; (effort). To these added &quot;gurutva&quot; (heaviness), &quot;dravatva&quot; (fluidity), &quot;sneha&quot; (viscosity), &quot;dharma&quot; (merit), &quot;adharma&quot; (demerit), (sound) and (faculty).
# &quot;Karma&quot; (activity): The &quot;karma&quot;s (activities) like s (qualities) have no separate existence, they belong to the substances. But while a quality is a permanent feature of a substance, an activity is a transient one. (ether), (time), &quot;dik&quot; (space) and (self), though substances, are devoid of &quot;karma&quot; (activity).
# &quot;Sāmānya&quot; (generality): Since there are plurality of substances, there will be relations among them. When a property is found common to many substances, it is called .
# (particularity): By means of , we are able to perceive substances as different from one another. As the ultimate atoms are innumerable so are the s.
# (inherence): defined as the relation between the cause and the effect. defined it as the relationship existing between the substances that are inseparable, standing to one another in the relation of the container and the contained. The relation of is not perceivable but only inferable from the inseparable connection of the substances.
# &quot;Abhava&quot; (non-existence)

=== Atomism ===
According to the school, a &quot;paramanu&quot; (atom) is an indestructible particle of matter. The atom is indivisible because it is a state at which no measurement can be attributed. They used invariance arguments to determine properties of the atoms. It also stated that &quot;anu&quot; can have two states—absolute rest and a state of motion.

They postulated four different kinds of atoms: two with mass, and two without. Each substance is supposed to consist of all four kinds of atoms. Atoms can be combined into s (triads) and (dyad)before they aggregate into bodies of a kind that can be perceived. Each (atom) possesses its own distinct (individuality) 

The measure of the partless atoms is known as &quot;parimaṇḍala parimāṇa&quot;. It is eternal and it cannot generate the measure of any other substance. Its measure is its own absolutely.

==Epistemology==
Six &quot;pramāṇas&quot; (epistemically reliable means to accurate knowledge and to truths) are noted within different Indian philsophical schools: &quot;Pratyakṣa&quot; (perception), &quot;Anumāna&quot; (inference), &quot;Śabda&quot; or &quot;āgama&quot; &quot;(word, testimony of past or present reliable experts), &quot;Upamāna&quot; (comparison and analogy), &quot;Arthāpatti&quot; (postulation, derivation from circumstances), and &quot;Anupalabdhi&quot; (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof). Of these epistemology considered only &quot;pratyakṣa&quot; (perception) and (inference) as reliable means of valid knowledge. Yoga accepts the first three of these six as pramāṇa; and the Nyaya school, related to Vaiśeṣika, accepts the first four out of these six.
* Pratyakṣa (प्रत्यक्ष) means perception. It is of two types: external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind. The ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism identify four requirements for correct perception: &quot;Indriyarthasannikarsa&quot; (direct experience by one&#x27;s sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), &quot;Avyapadesya&quot; (non-verbal; correct perception is not through hearsay, according to ancient Indian scholars, where one&#x27;s sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else&#x27;s perception), &quot;Avyabhicara&quot; (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one&#x27;s sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and &quot;Vyavasayatmaka&quot; (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one&#x27;s failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe). Some ancient scholars proposed &quot;unusual perception&quot; as &quot;pramāṇa&quot; and called it internal perception, a proposal contested by other Indian scholars. The internal perception concepts included &quot;pratibha&quot; (intuition), &quot;samanyalaksanapratyaksa&quot; (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and &quot;jnanalaksanapratyaksa&quot; (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a &#x27;topic of study&#x27; by observing its current state). Further, the texts considered and refined rules of accepting uncertain knowledge from &quot;Pratyakṣa-pranama&quot;, so as to contrast &quot;nirnaya&quot; (definite judgment, conclusion) from &quot;anadhyavasaya&quot; (indefinite judgment).
* Anumāna (अनुमान) means inference. It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason. Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of &quot;Anumana&quot;. In all except one Hindu philosophies, this is a valid and useful means to knowledge. The method of inference is explained by Indian texts as consisting of three parts: &quot;pratijna&quot; (hypothesis), &quot;hetu&quot; (a reason), and &quot;drshtanta&quot; (examples). The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts, state the ancient Indian scholars: &quot;sadhya&quot; (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and &quot;paksha&quot; (the object on which the &quot;sadhya&quot; is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if &quot;sapaksha&quot; (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if &quot;vipaksha&quot; (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies also state further epistemic steps. For example, they demand &quot;Vyapti&quot; - the requirement that the &quot;hetu&quot; (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in &quot;all&quot; cases, in both &quot;sapaksha&quot; and &quot;vipaksha&quot;. A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a &quot;nigamana&quot; (conclusion).

===Syllogism===
The syllogism of the school was similar to that of the Nyāya school of Hinduism, but the names given by to the 5 members of syllogism are different.

<doc id="307371" wikidata="Q164828" url="?curid=307371" title="Samkhya">
<text>Samkhya or Sankhya (; ) is a dualistic orthodox school of Hindu philosophy. It views reality as composed of two independent principles, &quot;Puruṣa&quot; (&#x27;consciousness&#x27; or spirit) and &quot;Prakṛti&quot; (nature or matter, including the human mind and emotions).

&quot;Puruṣa&quot; is the witness-consciousness. It is absolute, independent, free, beyond perception, above any experience by mind or senses, and impossible to describe in words.

&quot;Prakriti&quot; is matter or nature. It is inactive, unconscious, and is a balance of the three &quot;guṇas&quot; (qualities or innate tendencies), namely &quot;sattva&quot;, &quot;rajas&quot;, and &quot;tamas&quot;. When &quot;Prakṛti&quot; comes into contact with &quot;Purusha&quot; this balance is disturbed, and &quot;Prakriti&quot; becomes manifest, evolving twenty-three tattvas, namely intellect (&quot;buddhi&quot;, &quot;mahat&quot;), I-principle (&quot;ahamkara&quot;), mind (&quot;manas&quot;); the five sensory capacities known as ears, skin, eyes, tongue and nose; the five action capacities known as hands (hasta), feet (pada), speech (vak), anus (guda), and genitals (upastha); and the five &quot;subtle elements&quot; or &quot;modes of sensory content&quot; (&quot;tanmatras&quot;), from which the five &quot;gross elements&quot; or &quot;forms of perceptual objects&quot; (earth, water, fire, air and space) emerge, in turn giving rise to the manifestation of sensory experience and cognition.

&quot;Jiva&quot; (&#x27;a living being&#x27;) is the state in which &quot;Puruṣa&quot; is bonded to &quot;Prakriti&quot;. Human experience is an interplay of the two, &quot;Puruṣa&quot; being conscious of the various combinations of cognitive activities. The end of the bondage of &quot;Puruṣa&quot; to &quot;Prakriti&quot; is called &quot;Moksha&quot; (Liberation) or &quot;Kaivalya&quot; (Isolation).

Samkhya&#x27;s epistemology accepts three of six &quot;pramaṇas&quot; (&#x27;proofs&#x27;) as the only reliable means of gaining knowledge, as does yoga. These are &quot;pratyakṣa&quot; (&#x27;perception&#x27;), &quot;anumāṇa&quot; (&#x27;inference&#x27;) and &quot;śabda&quot; (&quot;āptavacana&quot;, meaning, &#x27;word/testimony of reliable sources&#x27;). Sometimes described as one of the rationalist schools of Indian philosophy, it relies exclusively on reason.

While Samkhya-like speculations can be found in the Rig Veda and some of the older Upanishads, some western scholars have proposed that Samkhya may have non-Vedic origins, developing in ascetic milieus. Proto-Samkhya ideas developed c. 8th/7th BC and onwards, as evidenced in the middle Upanishads, the &quot;Buddhacharita&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, and the &quot;Mokshadharma&quot;-section of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. It was related to the early ascetic traditions and meditation, spiritual practices, and religious cosmology, and methods of reasoning that result in liberating knowledge (&quot;vidya&quot;, &quot;jnana&quot;, &quot;viveka&quot;) that end the cycle of &quot;duḥkha&quot; (suffering) and rebirth allowing for &quot;a great variety of philosophical formulations&quot;. Pre-&quot;Karika&quot; systematic Samkhya existed around the beginning of the first millennium CE. The defining method of Samkhya was established with the Samkhyakarika (4th c. CE).

Samkhya might have been theistic or nontheistic, but with its classical systematization in the early first millennium CE, the existence of a deity became irrelevant. Samkhya is strongly related to the Yoga school of Hinduism, for which it forms the theoretical foundation, and it has influenced other schools of Indian philosophy.

==Etymology==

&quot;Sāṃkhya&quot; (सांख्य) or &quot;sāṅkhya&quot;, also transliterated as &quot;samkhya&quot; and &quot;sankhya&quot;, respectively, is a Sanskrit word that, depending on the context, means &#x27;to reckon, count, enumerate, calculate, deliberate, reason, reasoning by numeric enumeration, relating to number, rational&#x27;. In the context of ancient Indian philosophies, &quot;Samkhya&quot; refers to the philosophical school in Hinduism based on systematic enumeration and rational examination.

The word &quot;samkhya&quot; means &#x27;empirical&#x27; or &#x27;relating to numbers&#x27;. Although the term had been used in the general sense of metaphysical knowledge before, in technical usage it refers to the Samkhya school of thought that evolved into a cohesive philosophical system in early centuries CE. The Samkhya system is called so because &#x27;it &quot;enumerates&#x27;&quot; twenty five &quot;Tattvas&quot; or true principles; and its chief object is to effect the final emancipation of the twenty-fifth Tattva, i.e. the puruṣa or soul&#x27;.

==Philosophy==

===&quot;Puruṣa&quot; and &quot;Prakṛti&quot;===
Samkhya makes a distinction between two &quot;irreducible, innate and independent realities&quot;, &quot;Purusha&quot;, the witness-consciousness, and &quot;Prakṛti&quot;, &quot;matter&quot;, the activities of mind and perception. According to Dan Lusthaus,
Puruṣa is considered as the conscious principle, a passive enjoyer (&quot;bhokta&quot;) and the &quot;Prakṛti&quot; is the enjoyed (&quot;bhogya&quot;). Samkhya believes that the puruṣa cannot be regarded as the source of inanimate world, because an intelligent principle cannot transform itself into the unconscious world. It is a pluralistic spiritualism, atheistic realism and uncompromising dualism.

====&quot;Puruṣa&quot; – witness-consciousness====
&quot;Puruṣa&quot; is the witness-consciousness. It is absolute, independent, free, imperceptible, unknowable through other agencies, above any experience by mind or senses and beyond any words or explanations. It remains pure, &quot;nonattributive consciousness&quot;. &quot;Puruṣa&quot; is neither produced nor does it produce. No appellations can qualify &quot;Purusha&quot;, nor can it be substantialized or objectified. It &quot;cannot be reduced, can&#x27;t be &#x27;settled&#x27;&quot;. Any designation of &quot;Purusha&quot; comes from &quot;Prakriti&quot;, and is a limitation. Unlike Advaita Vedanta, and like Purva-Mīmāṃsā, Samkhya believes in plurality of the &quot;Puruṣas&quot;. However, while being multiple, &quot;Puruṣas&quot; are considered non-different because their essential attributes are the same.

====&quot;Prakṛti&quot; - cognitive processes====

&quot;Prakṛti&quot; is the first cause of the world of our experiences. Since it is the first principle (&quot;tattva&quot;) of the universe, it is called the &quot;pradhāna&quot; (chief principle), but, as it is the unconscious and unintelligent principle, it is also called the &quot;jaḍa&quot; (unintelligent). It is composed of three essential characteristics (&quot;triguna&quot;s). These are:
* &quot;Sattva&quot; – poise, fineness, lightness, illumination, and joy;
* &quot;Rajas&quot; – dynamism, activity, excitation, and pain;
* &quot;Tamas&quot; – inertia, coarseness, heaviness, obstruction, and sloth.

Unmanifested &quot;Prakriti&quot; is infinite, inactive, and unconscious, with the three gunas in a state of equilibrium. When this equilibrium of the &quot;guṇas&quot; is disturbed then unmanifest &quot;Prakṛti&quot;, along with the omnipresent witness-consciousness, &quot;Purusha&quot;, gives rise to the manifest world of experience. &quot;Prakriti&quot; becomes manifest as twenty-three &quot;tattvas&quot;: intellect (buddhi, mahat), ego (ahamkara) mind (&quot;manas&quot;); the five sensory capacities; the five action capacities; and the five &quot;subtle elements&quot; or &quot;modes of sensory content&quot; (&quot;tanmatras&quot;: form (&quot;rūpa&quot;), sound (&quot;shabda&quot;), smell (&quot;gandha&quot;), taste (&quot;rasa&quot;), touch (&quot;sparsha&quot;)), from which the five &quot;gross elements&quot; or &quot;forms of perceptual objects&quot; emerge (earth (prithivi), water (jala), fire (Agni), air (Vāyu), ether (Ākāsha)). &quot;Prakriti&quot; is the source of our experience; it is not &quot;the evolution of a series of material entities,&quot; but &quot;the emergence of experience itself&quot;. It is description of experience and the relations between its elements, not an explanation of the origin of the universe.

All &quot;Prakriti&quot; has these three &quot;guṇas&quot; in different proportions. Each &quot;guṇa&quot; is dominant at specific times of day. The interplay of these &quot;guṇa&quot; defines the character of someone or something, of nature and determines the progress of life. The Samkhya theory of &quot;guṇa&quot; was widely discussed, developed and refined by various schools of Indian philosophies. Samkhya&#x27;s philosophical treatises also influenced the development of various theories of Hindu ethics.

Thought processes and mental events are conscious only to the extent they receive illumination from &quot;Purusha&quot;. In Samkhya, consciousness is compared to light which illuminates the material configurations or &#x27;shapes&#x27; assumed by the mind. So intellect, after receiving cognitive structures from the mind and illumination from pure consciousness, creates thought structures that appear to be conscious. Ahamkara, the ego or the phenomenal self, appropriates all mental experiences to itself and thus, personalizes the objective activities of mind and intellect by assuming possession of them. But consciousness is itself independent of the thought structures it illuminates.

===Liberation or &quot;mokṣa&quot;===

Samkhya school considers &quot;moksha&quot; as a natural quest of every jiva. The Samkhyakarika states,

Samkhya regards ignorance (avidyā) as the root cause of suffering and bondage (&quot;Samsara&quot;). Samkhya states that the way out of this suffering is through knowledge (viveka). &quot;Mokṣa&quot; (liberation), states Samkhya school, results from knowing the difference between &quot;Prakṛti&quot; (avyakta-vyakta) and &quot;Puruṣa&quot; (jña). More specifically, the &quot;Puruṣa&quot; that has attained liberation is to be distinguished from a &quot;Puruṣa&quot; that is still bound on account of the liberated &quot;Puruṣa&quot; being free from its subtle body (synonymous with buddhi), in which is located the mental dispositions that individuates it and causes it to experience bondage.

&quot;Puruṣa&quot;, the eternal pure consciousness, due to ignorance, identifies itself with products of &quot;Prakṛti&quot; such as intellect (buddhi) and ego (ahamkara). This results in endless transmigration and suffering. However, once the realization arises that &quot;Puruṣa&quot; is distinct from &quot;Prakṛti&quot;, is more than empirical ego, and that puruṣa is deepest conscious self within, the Self gains isolation (&quot;kaivalya&quot;) and freedom (&quot;moksha&quot;).

Though in conventional terms the bondage is ascribed to the &quot;Puruṣa&quot;, this is ultimately a mistake. This is because the Samkhya school (Samkhya karika Verse 63) maintains that it is actually &quot;Prakriti&quot; that binds itself, and thus bondage should in reality be ascribed to &quot;Prakriti&quot;, not to the &quot;Puruṣa&quot;:

Vacaspati gave a metaphorical example to elaborate the position that the &quot;Puruṣa&quot; is only mistakenly ascribed bondage: although the king is ascribed victory or defeat, it is actually the soldiers that experience it. It is then not merely that bondage is only mistakenly ascribed to the &quot;Puruṣa&quot;, but that liberation is like bondage, wrongly ascribed to the &quot;Puruṣa&quot; and should be ascribed to &quot;Prakriti&quot; alone.

Other forms of Samkhya teach that &quot;Mokṣa&quot; is attained by one&#x27;s own development of the higher faculties of discrimination achieved by meditation and other yogic practices. &quot;Moksha&quot; is described by Samkhya scholars as a state of liberation, where &quot;sattva guṇa&quot; predominates.

=== Epistemology ===

Samkhya considered &quot;Pratyakṣa&quot; or &quot;Dṛṣṭam&quot; (direct sense perception), &quot;Anumāna&quot; (inference), and &quot;Śabda&quot; or &quot;Āptavacana&quot; (verbal testimony of the sages or shāstras) to be the only valid means of knowledge or &quot;pramana&quot;. Unlike some other schools, Samkhya did not consider the following three &quot;pramanas&quot; to be epistemically proper: &quot;Upamāṇa&quot; (comparison and analogy), &quot;Arthāpatti&quot; (postulation, deriving from circumstances) or &quot;Anupalabdi&quot; (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof).
* Pratyakṣa (प्रत्यक्ष) means perception. It is of two types in Hindu texts: external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind. The ancient and medieval Indian texts identify four requirements for correct perception: &quot;Indriyarthasannikarsa&quot; (direct experience by one&#x27;s sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), &quot;Avyapadesya&quot; (non-verbal; correct perception is not through hearsay, according to ancient Indian scholars, where one&#x27;s sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else&#x27;s perception), &quot;Avyabhicara&quot; (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one&#x27;s sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and &quot;Vyavasayatmaka&quot; (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one&#x27;s failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe). Some ancient scholars proposed &quot;unusual perception&quot; as &quot;pramana&quot; and called it internal perception, a proposal contested by other Indian scholars. The internal perception concepts included &quot;pratibha&quot; (intuition), &quot;samanyalaksanapratyaksa&quot; (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and &quot;jnanalaksanapratyaksa&quot; (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a &#x27;topic of study&#x27; by observing its current state). Further, some schools considered and refined rules of accepting uncertain knowledge from &quot;Pratyakṣa-pranama&quot;, so as to contrast &quot;nirnaya&quot; (definite judgment, conclusion) from &quot;anadhyavasaya&quot; (indefinite judgment).
* Anumāna (अनुमान) means inference. It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason. Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of &quot;Anumana&quot;. In all except one Hindu philosophies, this is a valid and useful means to knowledge. The method of inference is explained by Indian texts as consisting of three parts: &quot;pratijna&quot; (hypothesis), &quot;hetu&quot; (a reason), and &quot;drshtanta&quot; (examples). The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts, state the ancient Indian scholars: &quot;sadhya&quot; (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and &quot;paksha&quot; (the object on which the &quot;sadhya&quot; is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if &quot;sapaksha&quot; (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if &quot;vipaksha&quot; (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies also state further epistemic steps. For example, they demand &quot;Vyapti&quot; - the requirement that the &quot;hetu&quot; (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in &quot;all&quot; cases, in both &quot;sapaksha&quot; and &quot;vipaksha&quot;. A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a &quot;nigamana&quot; (conclusion).
* Śabda (शब्द) means relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts. Hiriyanna explains &quot;Sabda-pramana&quot; as a concept which means reliable expert testimony. The schools which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly. He must cooperate with others to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other&#x27;s lives. This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through &quot;Sabda&quot; (words). The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the &quot;Sabda&quot; of Vedas. The disagreement between the schools has been on how to establish reliability. Some schools, such as Carvaka, state that this is never possible, and therefore &quot;Sabda&quot; is not a proper &quot;pramana&quot;. Other schools debate means to establish reliability.

=== Causality ===

The Samkhya system is based on Sat-kārya-vāda or the theory of causation. According to Satkāryavāda, the effect is pre-existent in the cause. There is only an apparent or illusory change in the makeup of the cause and not a material one, when it becomes effect. Since, effects cannot come from nothing, the original cause or ground of everything is seen as &quot;Prakṛti&quot;.

More specifically, Samkhya system follows the &quot;prakṛti-Parināma Vāda&quot;. &quot;Parināma&quot; denotes that the effect is a real transformation of the cause. The cause under consideration here is &quot;Prakṛti&quot; or more precisely &quot;Moola-Prakṛti&quot; (&quot;Primordial Matter&quot;). The Samkhya system is therefore an exponent of an evolutionary theory of matter beginning with primordial matter. In evolution, &quot;Prakṛti&quot; is transformed and differentiated into multiplicity of objects. Evolution is followed by dissolution. In dissolution the physical existence, all the worldly objects mingle back into &quot;Prakṛti&quot;, which now remains as the undifferentiated, primordial substance. This is how the cycles of evolution and dissolution follow each other. But this theory is very different from the modern theories of science in the sense that &quot;Prakṛti&quot; evolves for each Jiva separately, giving individual bodies and minds to each and after liberation these elements of &quot;Prakṛti&quot; merges into the &quot;Moola-Prakṛti&quot;. Another uniqueness of Sāmkhya is that not only physical entities but even mind, ego and intelligence are regarded as forms of Unconsciousness, quite distinct from pure consciousness.

Samkhya theorizes that &quot;Prakṛti&quot; is the source of the perceived world of becoming. It is pure potentiality that evolves itself successively into twenty four &quot;tattvas&quot; or principles. The evolution itself is possible because &quot;Prakṛti&quot; is always in a state of tension among its constituent strands or gunas – &quot;sattva&quot;, &quot;rajas&quot; and &quot;tamas&quot;. In a state of equilibrium of three gunas, when the three together are one, &quot;unmanifest&quot; &quot;Prakṛti&quot; which is unknowable. A &quot;guṇa&quot; is an entity that can change, either increase or decrease, therefore, pure consciousness is called nirguna or without any modification.

The evolution obeys causality relationships, with primal Nature itself being the material cause of all physical creation. The cause and effect theory of Samkhya is called &quot;Satkārya-vāda&quot; (&quot;theory of existent causes&quot;), and holds that nothing can really be created from or destroyed into nothingness – all evolution is simply the transformation of primal Nature from one form to another.

Samkhya cosmology describes how life emerges in the universe; the relationship between &quot;Purusha&quot; and &quot;Prakṛti&quot; is crucial to Patanjali&#x27;s yoga system. The strands of Samkhya thought can be traced back to the Vedic speculation of creation. It is also frequently mentioned in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and &quot;Yogavasishta&quot;.

== Historical development ==
Larson (1969) discerns four basic periods in the development of Samkhya:
# 8/9th c. BCE - 5th c. BCE: &quot;ancient speculations,&quot; including speculative Vedic hymns and the oldest prose Upanishads
# 4th.c. BCE-1st c. CE: proto-Samkhya speculations, as found in the middle Upanishads, the Buddhacarita, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Mahabharata
# 1st-10/11th c. CE: classical Samkhya
# 15th-17th c.: renaissance of later Samkhya

Larson (1987) discerns three phases of development of the term &quot;samkhya&quot;, relating to three different meanings:
# Vedic period and the Mauryan Empire, until the 4th and 3rd c. BCE: &quot;relating to number, enumeration or calculation.&quot; Intellectual inquiry was &quot;frequently cast in the format of elaborate enumerations; references to &quot;samkhya&quot; do not denote integrated systems of thought.
# 8th/7th c. BCE - first centuries CE: as a masculine noun, referring to &quot;someone who calculates, enumerates, or discriminates properly or correctly.&quot; Proto-samkhya, related to the early ascetic traditions,reflected in the &quot;Moksadharma&quot; section of the Mahabharata, the Bhagavad Gita, and the cosmological speculations of the Puranas. The notion of &quot;samkhya&quot; becomes related to methods of reasoning that result in liberating knowledge (&quot;vidya&quot;, &quot;jnana&quot;, &quot;viveka&quot;) that end the cycle of &quot;dukkha&quot; and rebirth. During this period, &quot;samkhya&quot; becomes explicitly related to meditation, spiritual practices, and religious cosmology, and is &quot;primarily a methodology for attaining liberation and appears to allow for a great variety of philosophical formulations.&quot; According to Larson, &quot;Samkhya means in the Upanishads and the Epic simply the way of salvation by knowledge.&quot; As such, it contains &quot;psychological analyses of experience&quot; that &quot;become dominant motifs in Jain and Buddhist meditation contexts.&quot; Typical Samkhya terminology and issues develop. While yoga emphasizes &quot;asanas&quot; breathing, and ascetic practices, &quot;samkhya&quot; is concerned with intellectual analyses and proper discernment, but &quot;samkhya&quot;-reasonong is not really differentiated from yoga. According to Van Buitenen, these ideas developed in the interaction between various &quot;sramanas&quot; and ascetic groups. Numerous ancient teachers are named in the various texts, including Kapila and Pancasikha.
# 1st c. BCE - first centuries CE: as a neuter term, referring to the beginning of a technical philosophical system. Pre-&quot;karika-&quot;Samkhya (ca. 100 BCE – 200 CE). This period ends with Ishvara Krishna&#x27;s (Iśvarakṛṣṇa, 350 CE) &quot;Samkhyakarika&quot;. According to Larson, the shift of Samkhya from speculations to the normative conceptualization hints—but does not conclusively prove—that Samkhya may be the oldest of the Indian technical philosophical schools (e.g. Nyaya, Vaisheshika and Buddhist ontology), one that evolved over time and influenced the technical aspects of Buddhism and Jainism.

===Ancient speculations===
The early, speculative phase took place in the first half of the first millennium BCE, when ascetic spirituality and monastic (&quot;sramana&quot; and &quot;yati&quot;) traditions came into vogue in India, and ancient scholars combined &quot;enumerated set[s] of principles&quot; with &quot;a methodology of reasoning that results in spiritual knowledge (&quot;vidya, jnana, viveka&quot;).&quot; These early non-Samkhya speculations and proto-Samkhya ideas are visible in earlier Hindu scriptures such as the Vedas, early Upanishads such as the Chandogya Upanishad, and the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;. However, these early speculations and proto-Samkhya ideas had not distilled and congealed into a distinct, complete philosophy.

====Ascetic origins====
While some earlier scholars have argued for Upanishadic origins of the Samkhya-tradition, and the Upanisads contain dualistic speculations which may have influenced proto-samkhya, other scholars have noted the dissimilarities of Shamkhya with the Vedic tradition. As early as 1898, Richard Karl von Garbe, a German professor of philosophy and Indologist, wrote in 1898,
Dandekar, similarly wrote in 1968, &#x27;The origin of the Sankhya is to be traced to the pre-Vedic non-Aryan thought complex&#x27;. Heinrich Zimmer states that Samkhya has non-Aryan origins.

Anthony Warder (1994; first ed. 1967) writes that the Samkhya and Mīmāṃsā schools appear to have been established before the Sramana traditions in India (500 BCE), and he finds that &quot;Samkhya represents a relatively free development of speculation among the Brahmans, independent of the Vedic revelation.&quot; Warder writes, &#x27;[Samkhya] has indeed been suggested to be non-Brahmanical and even anti-Vedic in origin, but there is no tangible evidence for that except that it is very different than most Vedic speculation – but that is (itself) quite inconclusive. Speculations in the direction of the Samkhya can be found in the early Upanishads.&quot;

According to Ruzsa in 2006, &quot;Sāṅkhya has a very long history. Its roots go deeper than textual traditions allow us to see,&quot; stating that &quot;Sāṅkhya likely grew out of speculations rooted in cosmic dualism and introspective meditational practice.&quot; The dualism is rooted in agricultural concepts of the union of the male sky-god and the female earth-goddess, the union of &quot;the spiritual, immaterial, lordly, immobile fertilizer (represented as the Śiva-liṅgam, or phallus) and of the active, fertile, powerful but subservient material principle (Śakti or Power, often as the horrible Dark Lady, Kālī).&quot; In contrast,

According to Ruzsa,
Burley argues for an ontegenetic or incremental development of Shamkya, instead of being established by one historical founder. Burley states that India&#x27;s religio-cultural heritage is complicated and likely experienced a non-linear development. Samkhya is not necessarily non-Vedic nor pre-Vedic nor a &#x27;reaction to Brahmanic hegemony&#x27;, states Burley. It is most plausibly in its origins a lineage that grew and evolved from a combination of ascetic traditions and Vedic &quot;guru&quot; (teacher) and disciples. Burley suggests the link between Samkhya and Yoga as likely the root of this evolutionary origin during the Vedic era of India. According to Van Buitenen, various ideas on yoga and meditation developed in the interaction between various &quot;sramanas&quot; and ascetic groups.

====Rig Vedic speculations====
The earliest mention of dualism is in the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, a text that was compiled in the late second millennium BCE., in various chapters.

At a mythical level, dualism is found in the Indra–Vritra myth of chapter 1.32 of the Rigveda. Enumeration, the etymological root of the word &quot;samkhya&quot;, is found in numerous chapters of the Rigveda, such as 1.164, 10.90 and 10.129. According to Larson, it is likely that in the oldest period these enumerations were occasionally also applied in the context of meditation themes and religious cosmology, such as in the hymns of 1.164 (Riddle Hymns) and 10.129 (Nasadiya Hymns). However, these hymns present only the outline of ideas, not specific Samkhya theories and these theories developed in a much later period.

The Riddle hymns of the Rigveda, famous for their numerous enumerations, structural language symmetry within the verses and the chapter, enigmatic word play with anagrams that symbolically portray parallelism in rituals and the cosmos, nature and the inner life of man. This hymn includes enumeration (counting) as well as a series of dual concepts cited by early Upanishads . For example, the hymns 1.164.2 - 1.164-3 mention &quot;seven&quot; multiple times, which in the context of other chapters of Rigveda have been interpreted as referring to both seven priests at a ritual and seven constellations in the sky, the entire hymn is a riddle that paints a ritual as well as the sun, moon, earth, three seasons, the transitory nature of living beings, the passage of time and spirit.

The chapter 1.164 asks a number of metaphysical questions, such as &quot;what is the One in the form of the Unborn that created the six realms of the world?&quot;. Dualistic philosophical speculations then follow in chapter 1.164 of the Rigveda, particularly in the well studied &quot;allegory of two birds&quot; hymn (1.164.20 - 1.164.22), a hymn that is referred to in the Mundaka Upanishad and other texts . The two birds in this hymn have been interpreted to mean various forms of dualism: &quot;the sun and the moon&quot;, the &quot;two seekers of different kinds of knowledge&quot;, and &quot;the body and the atman&quot;.
The emphasis of duality between existence (sat) and non-existence (asat) in the Nasadiya Sukta of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; is similar to the vyakta–avyakta (manifest–unmanifest) polarity in Samkhya. The hymns about Puruṣa may also have had some influence on Samkhya. The Samkhya notion of buddhi or mahat is similar to the notion of hiranyagarbha, which appears in both the &quot;Rigveda&quot; and the &quot;Shvetashvatara Upanishad&quot;.

====Early Upanishads====
The oldest of the major Upanishads (c. 900–600 BCE) contain speculations along the lines of classical Samkhya philosophy. The concept of ahamkara was traced back by Van Buitenen to chapters 1.2 and 1.4 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and chapter 7.25 of the &quot;Chāndogya Upaniṣad&quot;, where it is a &quot;cosmic entity,&quot; and not a psychological notion. Satkaryavada, the theory of causation in Samkhya, may in part be traced to the verses in sixth chapter which emphasize the primacy of sat (being) and describe creation from it. The idea that the three gunas or attributes influence creation is found in both Chandogya and Shvetashvatara Upanishads.

Yajnavalkya&#x27;s exposition on the Self in the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot;, and the dialogue between Uddalaka Aruni and his son Svetaketu in the &quot;Chandogya Upanishad&quot; represent a more developed notion of the essence of man (&quot;Atman&quot;) as &quot;pure subjectivity - i.e., the knower who is himself unknowable, the seer who cannot be seen,&quot; and as &quot;pure conscious,&quot; discovered by means of speculations, or enumerations. According to Larson, &quot;it seems quite likely that both the monistic trends in Indian thought and the dualistic samkhya could have developed out of these ancient speculations.&quot; According to Larson, the enumeration of tattvas in Samkhya is also found in Taittiriya Upanishad, Aitareya Upanishad and Yajnavalkya–Maitri dialogue in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.

===Proto classical samkhya===

====Buddhist and Jainist influences====
Jainism was re-organised in 9th century BCE and Buddhism had developed in eastern India by the 5th century BCE. It is probable that these schools of thought and the earliest schools of Samkhya influenced each other. According to Burely, there is no evidence that a systematic samkhya-philosophy existed prior to the founding of Buddhism and Jainism, sometime in the 5th or 4th century BCE. A prominent similarity between Buddhism and Samkhya is the greater emphasis on suffering (dukkha) as the foundation for their respective soteriological theories, than other Indian philosophies. However, suffering appears central to Samkhya in its later literature, which likely suggests a Buddhist influence. Eliade, however, presents the alternate theory that Samkhya and Buddhism developed their soteriological theories over time, benefiting from their mutual influence.

Likewise, the Jain doctrine of plurality of individual souls (jiva) could have influenced the concept of multiple purushas in Samkhya. However Hermann Jacobi, an Indologist, thinks that there is little reason to assume that Samkhya notion of Purushas was solely dependent on the notion of jiva in Jainism. It is more likely, that Samkhya was moulded by many ancient theories of soul in various Vedic and non-Vedic schools.
Larson, Bhattacharya and Potter state it to be likely that early Samkhya doctrines found in oldest Upanishads (700-800 BCE) provided the contextual foundations and influenced Buddhist and Jaina doctrines, and these became contemporaneous, sibling intellectual movements with Samkhya and other schools of Hindu philosophy. This is evidenced, for example, by the references to Samkhya in ancient and medieval era Jaina literature.

====Middle upanishads====
Samkhya and Yoga are mentioned together for first time in chapter 6.13 of the Shvetashvatra Upanishad, as &quot;samkhya-yoga-adhigamya&quot; (literally, &quot;to be understood by proper reasoning and spiritual discipline&quot;).

The Katha Upanishad (5th-1st c. BCE) in verses 3.10–13 and 6.7–11 describes a concept of puruṣa, and other concepts also found in later Samkhya. The &quot;Shvetashvatara Upanishad&quot; in chapter 6.13 describes samkhya with Yoga philosophy, and Bhagavad Gita in book 2 provides axiological implications of Samkhya, therewith providing textual evidence of samkhyan terminology and concepts. Katha Upanishad conceives the Purusha (cosmic spirit, consciousness) as same as the individual soul (Ātman, Self).

====Bhagavad Gita and Mahabharata====
The Bhagavad Gita identifies Samkhya with understanding or knowledge. The three gunas are also mentioned in the Gita, though they are not used in the same sense as in classical Samkhya. The Gita integrates Samkhya thought with the devotion (bhakti) of theistic schools and the impersonal Brahman of Vedanta.

The &quot;Mokshadharma&quot; chapter of Shanti Parva (Book of Peace) in the Mahabharata epic, composed between 400 BCE to 400 CE, explains Samkhya ideas along with other extant philosophies, and then lists numerous scholars in recognition of their philosophical contributions to various Indian traditions, and therein at least three Samkhya scholars can be recognized – Kapila, Asuri and Pancasikha. The 12th chapter of the &quot;Buddhacarita&quot;, a buddhist text composed in the early second century CE, suggests Samkhya philosophical tools of reliable reasoning were well formed by about 5th century BCE. According to Rusza, &quot;The ancient Buddhist Aśvaghoṣa (in his Buddha-Carita) describes Āḷāra Kālāma, the teacher of the young Buddha (ca. 420 B.C.E.) as following an archaic form of Sāṅkhya.&quot;

===Classical Samkhya===
According to Ruzsa, about 2,000 years ago &quot;Sāṅkhya became the representative philosophy of Hindu thought in Hindu circles&quot;, influencing all strands of the Hindu tradition and Hindu texts.

====Traditional credited founders====
Sage Kapila is traditionally credited as a founder of the Samkhya school. It is unclear in which century of the 1st millennium BCE Kapila lived. Kapila appears in Rigveda, but context suggests that the word means &#x27;reddish-brown color&#x27;. Both Kapila as a &#x27;seer&#x27; and the term &quot;Samkhya&quot; appear in hymns of section 5.2 in Shvetashvatara Upanishad (300 BCE), suggesting Kapila&#x27;s and Samkhya philosophy&#x27;s origins may predate it. Numerous other ancient Indian texts mention Kapila; for example, Baudhayana Grhyasutra in chapter IV.16.1 describes a system of rules for ascetic life credited to Kapila called &quot;Kapila Sannyasa Vidha&quot;. A 6th century CE Chinese translation and other texts consistently note Kapila as an ascetic and the founder of the school, mention Asuri as the inheritor of the teaching and a much later scholar named Pancasikha as the scholar who systematized it and then helped widely disseminate its ideas. Isvarakrsna is identified in these texts as the one who summarized and simplified Samkhya theories of Pancasikha, many centuries later (roughly 4th or 5th century CE), in the form that was then translated into Chinese by Paramartha in the 6th century CE.

====Samkhyakarika====
The earliest surviving authoritative text on classical Samkhya philosophy is the &quot;Samkhya Karika&quot; (c. 200 CE or 350–450 CE) of Īśvarakṛṣṇa. There were probably other texts in early centuries CE, however none of them are available today. Iśvarakṛṣṇa in his &quot;Kārikā&quot; describes a succession of the disciples from Kapila, through &quot;Āsuri and &quot;Pañcaśikha to himself. The text also refers to an earlier work of Samkhya philosophy called Ṣaṣṭitantra (science of sixty topics) which is now lost. The text was imported and translated into Chinese about the middle of the 6th century CE. The records of Al Biruni, the Persian visitor to India in the early 11th century, suggests Samkhyakarika was an established and definitive text in India in his times.

&quot;Samkhyakarika&quot; includes distilled statements on epistemology, metaphysics and soteriology of the Samkhya school. For example, the fourth to sixth verses of the text states it epistemic premises,

The most popular commentary on the Samkhyakarika was the Gauḍapāda Bhāṣya attributed to Gauḍapāda, the proponent of Advaita Vedanta school of philosophy. Other important commentaries on the karika were &quot;Yuktidīpīka&quot; (c. 6th century CE) and &quot;Vācaspati&quot;’s &quot;Sāṁkhyatattvakaumudī&quot; (c. 10th century CE).

====Yuktidipika====
Between 1938 and 1967, two previously unknown manuscript editions of &quot;Yuktidipika&quot; (ca. 600–700 CE) were discovered and published. &quot;Yuktidipika&quot; is an ancient review by an unknown author and has emerged as the most important commentary on the &quot;Samkhyakarika&quot;, itself an ancient key text of the Samkhya school. This commentary as well as the reconstruction of pre-&quot;karika&quot; epistemology and Samkhya emanation text (containing cosmology-ontology) from the earliest Puranas and &quot;Mokshadharma&quot; suggest that Samkhya as a technical philosophical system existed from about the last century BCE to the early centuries of the Common Era. &quot;Yuktidipika&quot; suggests that many more ancient scholars contributed to the origins of Samkhya in ancient India than were previously known and that Samkhya was a polemical philosophical system. However, almost nothing is preserved from the centuries when these ancient Samkhya scholars lived.

===Samkhya revival===

The 13th century text &quot;Sarvadarsanasangraha&quot; contains 16 chapters, each devoted to a separate school of Indian philosophy. The 13th chapter in this book contains a description of the Samkhya philosophy.

The &quot;Sāṁkhyapravacana Sūtra&quot; (c. 14th century CE) renewed interest in Samkhya in the medieval era. It is considered the second most important work of Samkhya after the karika. Commentaries on this text were written by Anirruddha (&quot;Sāṁkhyasūtravṛtti&quot;, c. 15th century CE), Vijñānabhikṣu (&quot;Sāṁkhyapravacanabhāṣya&quot;, c. 16th century CE), Mahādeva (vṛttisāra, c. 17th century CE) and Nāgeśa (&quot;Laghusāṁkhyasūtravṛtti&quot;). In his introduction, the commentator Vijnana Bhiksu stated that only a sixteenth part of the original Samkhya Sastra remained, and that the rest had been lost to time. While the commentary itself is no doubt medieval, the age of the underlying sutras is unknown and perhaps much older. According to Surendranath Dasgupta, scholar of Indian philosophy, Charaka Samhita, an ancient Indian medical treatise, also contains thoughts from an early Samkhya school.

== Views on God ==
Although the Samkhya school considers the Vedas a reliable source of knowledge, samkhya accepts the notion of higher selves or perfected beings but rejects the notion of God, according to Paul Deussen and other scholars, although other scholars believe that Samkhya is as much theistic as the Yoga school. According to Rajadhyaksha, classical Samkhya argues against the existence of God on metaphysical grounds. Samkhya theorists argue that an unchanging God cannot be the source of an ever-changing world and that God was only a necessary metaphysical assumption demanded by circumstances.

The oldest commentary on the Samkhakarika, the Yuktidīpikā, asserts the existence of God, stating:
&quot;We do not completely reject the particular power of the Lord, since he assumes a majestic body and so forth. Our intended meaning is just that there is no being who is different from prakrti and purusa and who is the instigator of these two, as you claim. Therefore, your view is refuted. The conjunction between prakrti and purusa is not instigated by another being.

A medieval commentary of Samkhakarika such as &quot;&quot; in verse no. 1.92 directly states that existence of &quot;Ishvara (God) is unproved&quot;. Hence there is no philosophical place for a creationist God in this system. It is also argued by commentators of this text that the existence of Ishvara cannot be proved and hence cannot be admitted to exist. However, later in the text, the commentator Vijnana Bhiksu clarified that the subject of dispute between the Samkhyas and others was the existence of an &quot;eternal&quot; Isvara. Samkhya did accept the concept of an &quot;emergent&quot; Isvara previously absorbed into Prakriti.

A key difference between the Samkhya and Yoga schools, state scholars, is that the Yoga school accepts a &#x27;personal, yet essentially inactive, deity&#x27; or &#x27;personal god&#x27;. However, Radhanath Phukan, in the introduction to his translation of the &quot;Samkhya Karika of Isvarakrsna&quot; has argued that commentators who see the unmanifested as non-conscious make the mistake of regarding Samkhya as atheistic, though Samkhya is equally as theistic as Yoga. A majority of modern academic scholars are of view that the concept of Ishvara was incorporated into the &quot;nirishvara&quot; (atheistic) Samkhya viewpoint only after it became associated with the Yoga, the Pasupata and the Bhagavata schools of philosophy. Others have traced the concept of the emergent Isvara accepted by Samkhya to as far back as the Rig Veda, where it was called Hiranyagarbha (the golden germ, golden egg). This theistic Samkhya philosophy is described in the Mahabharata, the Puranas and the Bhagavad Gita.

Chandradhar Sharma in 1960 affirmed that Samkhya in the beginning was based on the theistic absolute of Upanishads, but later on, under the influence of Jaina and Buddhist thought, it rejected theistic monism and was content with spiritualistic pluralism and atheistic realism. This also explains why some of the later Samkhya commentators, e.g. Vijnanabhiksu in the sixteenth century, tried to revive the earlier theism in Samkhya.

=== Arguments against Ishvara&#x27;s existence ===

According to Sinha, the following arguments were given by Samkhya philosophers against the idea of an eternal, self-caused, creator God:
* If the existence of karma is assumed, the proposition of God as a moral governor of the universe is unnecessary. For, if God enforces the consequences of actions then he can do so without karma. If however, he is assumed to be within the law of karma, then karma itself would be the giver of consequences and there would be no need of a God.
* Even if karma is denied, God still cannot be the enforcer of consequences. Because the motives of an enforcer God would be either egoistic or altruistic. Now, God&#x27;s motives cannot be assumed to be altruistic because an altruistic God would not create a world so full of suffering. If his motives are assumed to be egoistic, then God must be thought to have desire, as agency or authority cannot be established in the absence of desire. However, assuming that God has desire would contradict God&#x27;s eternal freedom which necessitates no compulsion in actions. Moreover, desire, according to Samkhya, is an attribute of prakṛti and cannot be thought to grow in God. The testimony of the Vedas, according to Samkhya, also confirms this notion.
* Despite arguments to the contrary, if God is still assumed to contain unfulfilled desires, this would cause him to suffer pain and other similar human experiences. Such a worldly God would be no better than Samkhya&#x27;s notion of higher self.
* Furthermore, there is no proof of the existence of God. He is not the object of perception, there exists no general proposition that can prove him by inference and the testimony of the Vedas speak of prakṛti as the origin of the world, not God.
Therefore, Samkhya maintained that the various cosmological, ontological and teleological arguments could not prove God.

== Influence on other schools ==

===Vaisheshika and Nyaya===

The Vaisheshika atomism, Nyaya epistemology may all have roots in the early Samkhya school of thought; but these schools likely developed in parallel with an evolving Samkhya tradition, as sibling intellectual movements.

=== Yoga ===

The Yoga school derives its ontology and epistemology from Samkhya and adds to it the concept of Isvara. However, scholarly opinion on the actual relationship between Yoga and Samkhya is divided. While Jakob Wilhelm Hauer and Georg Feuerstein believe that Yoga was a tradition common to many Indian schools and its association with Samkhya was artificially foisted upon it by commentators such as Vyasa. Johannes Bronkhorst and Eric Frauwallner think that Yoga never had a philosophical system separate from Samkhya. Bronkhorst further adds that the first mention of Yoga as a separate school of thought is no earlier than Śankara&#x27;s (c. 788–820 CE) Brahmasūtrabhaśya.

=== Tantra ===

The dualistic metaphysics of various Tantric traditions illustrates the strong influence of Samkhya on Tantra. Shaiva Siddhanta was identical to Samkhya in its philosophical approach, barring the addition of a transcendent theistic reality. Knut A. Jacobsen, Professor of Religious Studies, notes the influence of Samkhya on Srivaishnavism. According to him, this Tantric system borrows the abstract dualism of Samkhya and modifies it into a personified male–female dualism of Vishnu and Sri Lakshmi. Dasgupta speculates that the Tantric image of a wild Kali standing on a slumbering Shiva was inspired from the Samkhyan conception of prakṛti as a dynamic agent and Purusha as a passive witness. However, Samkhya and Tantra differed in their view on liberation. While Tantra sought to unite the male and female ontological realities, Samkhya held a withdrawal of consciousness from matter as the ultimate goal.

According to Bagchi, the Samkhya Karika (in karika 70) identifies Sāmkhya as a Tantra, and its philosophy was one of the main influences both on the rise of the Tantras as a body of literature, as well as Tantra sadhana.

===Advaita Vedanta===

The Advaita Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara called &quot;Samkhya&quot; as the &#x27;principal opponent&#x27; (&quot;pradhana-malla&quot;) of the Vedanta. He criticized the &quot;Samkhya&quot; view that the cause of the universe is the unintelligent &quot;Prakriti&quot; (&quot;Pradhan&quot;). According to Shankara, the Intelligent Brahman only can be such a cause. He considered &quot;Samkhya&quot; philosophy as propounded in Samkhyakarika to be inconsistent with the teachings in the Vedas, and considered the dualism in Samkhya to be non-Vedic. In contrast, ancient Samkhya philosophers in India claimed Vedic authority for their views.

<text>Mīmāṁsā (Sanskrit: मीमांसा; IAST: Mīmāṃsā) is a Sanskrit word that means &quot;reflection&quot; or &quot;critical investigation&quot; and thus refers to a tradition of contemplation which reflected on the meanings of certain Vedic texts. This tradition is also known as Pūrva-Mīmāṁsā because of its focus on the earlier (&quot;pūrva&quot;) Vedic texts dealing with ritual actions, and similarly as Karma-Mīmāṁsā due to its focus on ritual action (&quot;karma&quot;). It is one of six Vedic &quot;affirming&quot; (āstika) schools of Hindu philosophy. This particular school is known for its philosophical theories on the nature of Dharma, based on hermeneutics of the Vedas, especially the Brāḥmanas and samhitas. The Mīmāṃsā school was foundational and influential for the Vedāntic schools, which were also known as Uttara-Mīmāṁsā for their focus on the &quot;later&quot; (&quot;uttara&quot;) portions of the Vedas, the Upanishads. While both &quot;earlier&quot; and &quot;later&quot; Mīmāṃsā investigate the aim of human action, they do so with different attitudes towards the necessity of ritual praxis.

Mīmāṁsā has several sub-schools, each defined by its pramana. The Prabhākara sub-school, which takes its name from the seventh-century philosopher Prabhākara, described the five epistemically reliable means to gaining knowledge: &quot;pratyakṣa&quot; or perception; &quot;anumāna&quot; or inference; &quot;upamāṇa&quot;, comparison and analogy; &quot;arthāpatti&quot;, the use of postulation and derivation from circumstances; and &quot;shabda&quot;, the word or testimony of past or present reliable experts. The Bhāṭṭa sub-school, from philosopher Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, added a sixth means to its canon; &quot;anupalabdhi&quot; meant non-perception, or proof by the absence of cognition (e.g., the &quot;lack&quot; of gunpowder on a suspect&#x27;s hand)

The school of Mīmāṃsā consists of both non-theistic and theistic doctrines, but the school showed little interest in systematic examination of the existence of Gods. Rather, it held that the soul is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active spiritual essence, and focused on the epistemology and metaphysics of &quot;Dharma&quot;. For the Mīmāṃsā school, &quot;Dharma&quot; meant rituals and social duties, not &quot;Devas&quot;, or Gods, because Gods existed only in name. The Mīmāṃsakas also held that Vedas are &quot;eternal, author-less, [and] infallible&quot;, that Vedic &quot;vidhi&quot;, or injunctions and mantras in rituals are prescriptive &quot;kārya&quot; or actions, and the rituals are of primary importance and merit. They considered the Upaniṣads and other texts related to self-knowledge and spirituality as subsidiary, a philosophical view that Vedānta disagreed with.

While their deep analysis of language and linguistics influenced other schools of Hinduism, their views were not shared by others. Mīmāṃsakas considered the purpose and power of language was to clearly &quot;prescribe&quot; the proper, correct and right. In contrast, Vedāntins extended the scope and value of language as a tool to also &quot;describe&quot;, &quot;develop&quot; and &quot;derive&quot;. Mīmāṁsakās considered orderly, law driven, procedural life as central purpose and noblest necessity of Dharma and society, and divine (theistic) sustenance means to that end.

The Mīmāṁsā school is a form of philosophical realism. A key text of the Mīmāṁsā school is the Mīmāṁsā Sūtra of Jaimini.

==Terminology==
Mīmāṃsā (IAST), also romanized Mimansa or Mimamsa, means &quot;reflection, consideration, profound thought, investigation, examination, discussion&quot; in Sanskrit. It also refers to the &quot;examination of the Vedic text&quot; and to a school of Hindu philosophy that is also known as (&quot;prior&quot; inquiry, also ), in contrast to (&quot;posterior&quot; inquiry, also ) – the opposing school of Vedanta. This division is based on classification of the Vedic texts into &#x27;, the early sections of the Veda treating of mantras and rituals (Samhitas and Brahmanas), and the &#x27; dealing with the meditation, reflection and knowledge of Self, Oneness, Brahman (the Upaniṣads). Between the &quot;Samhitas&quot; and &quot;Brahmanas&quot;, the Mīmāṃsā school places greater emphasis to the Brahmanas – the part of Vedas that is a commentary on Vedic rituals.

The word comes from the desiderative stem of √man (Macdonell, A. A, 1883, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary), from Proto-Indo-European *men- (“to think”). Donald Davis translates Mīmāṃsā as the &quot;desire to think&quot;, and in colloquial historical context as &quot;how to think and interpret things&quot;. In the last centuries of the first millennium BCE, the word Mīmāṃsā began to denote the thoughts on and interpretation of the Vedas, first as &quot;Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā&quot; for rituals portions in the earlier layers of texts in the Vedas, and as &quot;Uttara-Mīmāṃsā&quot; for the philosophical portions in the last layers. Over time, Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā was just known as the Mīmāṃsā school, and the Uttara-Mīmāṃsā as the Vedanta school.

Mīmāṃsā scholars are referred to as &quot;Mīmāṃsāka&quot;s.

==Darśana (philosophy) – central concerns==
Mīmāṁsā is one of the six classical Hindu &quot;darśanas&quot;. It is among the earliest schools of Hindu philosophies. It has attracted relatively less scholarly study, although its theories and particularly its questions on exegesis and theology have been highly influential on all classical Indian philosophies. Its analysis of language has been of central importance to the legal literature of India.

Ancient Mīmāṁsā&#x27;s central concern was epistemology (&quot;pramana&quot;), that is what are the reliable means to knowledge. It debated not only &quot;how does man ever learn or know, whatever he knows&quot;, but also whether the nature of all knowledge is inherently circular, whether those such as foundationalists who critique the validity of any &quot;justified beliefs&quot; and knowledge system make flawed presumptions of the very premises they critique, and how to correctly interpret and avoid incorrectly interpreting dharma texts such as the Vedas. It asked questions such as &quot;what is &quot;devata&quot; (god)?&quot;, &quot;are rituals dedicated to &quot;devatas&quot; efficacious?&quot;, &quot;what makes anything efficacious?&quot;, and &quot;Can it be proved that the Vedas, or any canonical text in any system of thought, is fallible or infallible (&quot;svatah pramanya&quot;, intrinsically valid)?, if so, how?&quot; and others. To Mīmāṁsā scholars, the nature of non-empirical knowledge and human means to it are such that one can never demonstrate certainty, one can only falsify knowledge claims, in some cases. According to Francis Clooney, the Mīmāṁsā school is &quot;one of the most distinctively Hindu forms of thinking; it is without real parallel elsewhere in the world&quot;.

The central text of the Mīmāṁsā school is Jamini&#x27;s &quot;Mīmāṁsā Sutras&quot;, accompanied by the historically influential commentary of Sabara and Kumarila Bhatta&#x27;s commentary (&quot;Ślokavārttika&quot;) on Sabara&#x27;s commentary. Together, these texts develop and apply the rules of language analysis (such as the rules of contradiction), asserting that one must not only examine injunctive propositions in any scripture but also examine the alternate related or reverse propositions for better understanding. They suggested that to reach correct and valid knowledge it is not only sufficient to demand proof of a proposition, it is important to give proof of a proposition&#x27;s negative as well as declare and prove one&#x27;s preferred propositions. Further, they asserted that whenever perception is not the means of direct proof and knowledge, one cannot prove such non-empirical propositions to be &quot;true or not true&quot;, rather one can only prove a non-empirical proposition is &quot;false, not false, or uncertain&quot;.

For example, Mīmāṁsakas welcome not only the demand for proof of an injunctive proposition such as &quot;agnihotra ritual leads one to heaven&quot;, but suggest that one must examine and prove alternate propositions such as &quot;ritual does not lead one to heaven&quot;, &quot;something else leads one to heaven&quot;, &quot;there is heaven&quot;, &quot;there is no heaven&quot; and so on. Mīmāṁsā literature states that if satisfactory, verifiable proof for all of such propositions cannot be found by its proponents and its opponents, then the proposition needs to be accepted as a part of a &quot;belief system&quot;. Beliefs, such as those in the scriptures (Vedas), must be accepted to be true unless its opponents can demonstrate the proof of the validity of their own texts or teacher(s) these opponents presume to be &quot;prima facie justified&quot;, and until these opponents can demonstrate that the scriptures they challenge are false. If they do not try to do so, it is hypocrisy; if they try to do so, it can only lead to an infinite regress, according to Mīmānsākas. Any historic scripture with widespread social acceptance, according to Mīmāṁsāka, is an activity of communication (&quot;vyavaharapravrtti&quot;) and is accepted as authoritative because it is socially validated practice unless perceptually verifiable evidence emerges that proves parts or all of it as false or harmful.

Mīmāṁsākas were predominantly concerned with the central motivation of human beings, the highest good, and actions that make this possible. They stated that human beings seek &quot;niratisaya priti&quot; (unending ecstatic pleasure, joy, happiness) in this life and the next. They argued that this highest good is the result of one&#x27;s own ethical actions (&quot;dharma&quot;), that such actions are what the Vedic sentences contain and communicate, and therefore it important to properly interpret and understand Vedic sentences, words and meaning. Mīmāṁsā scholarship was centrally concerned with the philosophy of language, how human beings learn and communicate with each other and across generations with language in order to act in a manner that enables them to achieve that which motivates them. The Mīmāṁsā school focussed on &quot;dharma&quot;, deriving ethics and activity from the &quot;karma-kanda&quot; (rituals) part of the Vedas, with the argument that ethics for this life and efficacious action for &quot;svarga&quot; (heaven) cannot be derived from sense-perception, and can only be derived from experience, reflection and understanding of past teachings.
&lt;poem&gt;
In every human activity, the motivating force to perform an action is his innate longing for &quot;priti&quot; (pleasure, happiness),
whether at the lowest level or the highest level.
At the highest level, it is nothing but an unsurpassed state of &quot;priti&quot;,
which is ensured only by performing ethical actions.
&lt;/poem&gt;
– Sabara, 2nd century Mīmānsā scholar
According to Daniel Arnold, Mīmāṁsā scholarship has &quot;striking affinities&quot; with that of William Alston, the 20th century Western philosopher, along with some notable differences. The Mīmāṁsākas subjected to a radical critique, more than two thousand years ago, states Francis Clooney, the notions such as &quot;God,&quot; the &quot;sacred text,&quot; the &quot;author&quot; and the &quot;anthropocentric ordering of reality&quot;.

==Epistemology==
In the realm of epistemological studies, subsequent Mīmāṃsākas scholars have made significant contributions. Unlike the Nyaya or the Vaisheshika systems, the branch of Mīmāṃsā recognizes five means of valid knowledge (Skt. &quot;pramāṇa&quot;). In addition to these, the sub-school of Mīmāṃsā acknowledges a sixth means, namely &quot;anuapalabdhi&quot;, akin to the Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism. The following are the six epistemically reliable means of gaining knowledge:

===Pratyaksa===
&quot;Pratyakṣa&quot; (प्रत्यक्ष means perception. It is of two types in Mīmānsā and other schools of Hinduism: external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind. The ancient and medieval Indian texts identify four requirements for correct perception: &quot;Indriyarthasannikarsa&quot; (direct experience by one&#x27;s sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), &quot;Avyapadesya&quot; (non-verbal; correct perception is not through hearsay, according to ancient Indian scholars, where one&#x27;s sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else&#x27;s perception), &quot;Avyabhicara&quot; (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one&#x27;s sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and &quot;Vyavasayatmaka&quot; (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one&#x27;s failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe). Some ancient scholars proposed &quot;unusual perception&quot; as &quot;pramana&quot; and called it internal perception, a proposal contested by other Indian scholars. The internal perception concepts included &quot;pratibha&quot; (intuition), &quot;samanyalaksanapratyaksa&quot; (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and &quot;jnanalaksanapratyaksa&quot; (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a &#x27;topic of study&#x27; by observing its current state). Further, some schools of Hinduism considered and refined rules of accepting uncertain knowledge from &quot;Pratyakṣa-pramana&quot;, so as to contrast &quot;nirnaya&quot; (definite judgment, conclusion) from &quot;anadhyavasaya&quot; (indefinite judgment).

===Anumana===
&quot;Anumāṇa&quot; (अनुमान) means inference. It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason. Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of &quot;Anumana&quot;. In all except one Hindu philosophies, this is a valid and useful means to knowledge. The method of inference is explained by Indian texts as consisting of three parts: &quot;pratijna&quot; (hypothesis), &quot;hetu&quot; (a reason), and &quot;drshtanta&quot; (examples). The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts, state the ancient Indian scholars: &quot;sadhya&quot; (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and &quot;paksha&quot; (the object on which the &quot;sadhya&quot; is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if &quot;sapaksha&quot; (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if &quot;vipaksha&quot; (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies also state further epistemic steps. For example, they demand &quot;Vyapti&quot; – the requirement that the &quot;hetu&quot; (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in &quot;all&quot; cases, in both &quot;sapaksha&quot; and &quot;vipaksha&quot;. A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a &quot;nigamana&quot; (conclusion).

===Upamana===
&quot;Upamāṇa&quot; means comparison and analogy. Some Hindu schools consider it as a proper means of knowledge. &quot;Upamana&quot;, states Lochtefeld, may be explained with the example of a traveller who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like a cow, but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later. The subject of comparison is formally called &quot;upameyam&quot;, the object of comparison is called &quot;upamanam&quot;, while the attribute(s) are identified as &quot;samanya&quot;. Thus, explains Monier Monier-Williams, if a boy says &quot;her face is like the moon in charmingness&quot;, &quot;her face&quot; is &quot;upameyam&quot;, the moon is &quot;upamanam&quot;, and charmingness is &quot;samanya&quot;. The 7th century text Bhaṭṭikāvya in verses 10.28 through 10.63 discusses many types of comparisons and analogies, identifying when this epistemic method is more useful and reliable, and when it is not. In various ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism, 32 types of &quot;Upanama&quot; and their value in epistemology are debated.

===Arthāpatti===
&quot;Arthāpatti&quot; (अर्थापत्ति) means postulation, derivation from circumstances. In contemporary logic, this &quot;pramāṇa&quot; is similar to circumstantial implication. As example, if a person left in a boat on a river earlier, and the time is now past the expected time of arrival, then the circumstances support the truth postulate that the person has arrived. Many Indian scholars considered this &quot;pramāṇa&quot; as invalid or at best weak, because the boat may have gotten delayed or diverted. However, in cases such as deriving the time of a future sunrise or sunset, this method was asserted by the proponents to be reliable. Another common example for &quot;arthāpatti&quot; found in the texts of Mīmāṃsā and other schools of Hinduism is, that if &quot;Devadatta is fat&quot; and &quot;Devadatta does not eat in the day&quot;, then the following must be true: &quot;Devadatta eats in the night&quot;. This form of postulation and deriving from circumstances is, claim the Indian scholars, a means to discovery, proper insight and knowledge. The Hindu schools that accept this means of knowledge state that this method is a valid means to conditional knowledge and truths about a subject and object in original premises or different premises. The schools that do not accept this method, state that postulation, extrapolation and circumstantial implication is either derivable from other &quot;pramāṇas&quot; or flawed means to correct knowledge, instead one must rely on direct perception or proper inference.

===Anupalabdhi===
&quot;Anupalabdhi&quot; (अनुपलब्धि), accepted only by Kumarila Bhatta sub-school of Mīmāṃsā, means non-perception, negative/cognitive proof. &quot;Anupalabdhi pramana&quot; suggests that knowing a negative, such as &quot;there is no jug in this room&quot; is a form of valid knowledge. If something can be observed or inferred or proven as non-existent or impossible, then one knows more than what one did without such means. In the two schools of Hinduism that consider &quot;Anupalabdhi&quot; as epistemically valuable, a valid conclusion is either &quot;sadrupa&quot; (positive) or &quot;asadrupa&quot; (negative) relation – both correct and valuable. Like other &quot;pramana&quot;, Indian scholars refined &quot;Anupalabdi&quot; to four types: non-perception of the cause, non-perception of the effect, non-perception of object, and non-perception of contradiction. Only two schools of Hinduism accepted and developed the concept &quot;non-perception&quot; as a &quot;pramana&quot;. The schools that endorsed &quot;Anupalabdi&quot; affirmed that it as valid and useful when the other five &quot;pramanas&quot; fail in one&#x27;s pursuit of knowledge and truth.

&quot;Abhava&quot; (अभाव) means non-existence. Some scholars consider &quot;Anupalabdi&quot; to be same as &quot;Abhava&quot;, while others consider &quot;Anupalabdi&quot; and &quot;Abhava&quot; as different. &quot;Abhava-pramana&quot; has been discussed in ancient Hindu texts in the context of &quot;Padārtha&quot; (पदार्थ, referent of a term). A &quot;Padartha&quot; is defined as that which is simultaneously &quot;Astitva&quot; (existent), &quot;Jneyatva&quot; (knowable) and &quot;Abhidheyatva&quot; (nameable). Specific examples of &quot;padartha&quot;, states Bartley, include &quot;dravya&quot; (substance), &quot;guna&quot; (quality), &quot;karma&quot; (activity/motion), &quot;samanya/jati&quot; (universal/class property), &quot;samavaya&quot; (inherence) and &quot;vishesha&quot; (individuality). &quot;Abhava&quot; is then explained as &quot;referents of negative expression&quot; in contrast to &quot;referents of positive expression&quot; in &quot;Padartha&quot;. An absence, state the ancient scholars, is also &quot;existent, knowable and nameable&quot;, giving the example of negative numbers, silence as a form of testimony, &quot;asatkaryavada&quot; theory of causation, and analysis of deficit as real and valuable. &quot;Abhava&quot; was further refined in four types, by the schools of Hinduism that accepted it as a useful method of epistemology: &quot;dhvamsa&quot; (termination of what existed), &quot;atyanta-abhava&quot; (impossibility, absolute non-existence, contradiction), &quot;anyonya-abhava&quot; (mutual negation, reciprocal absence) and &quot;pragavasa&quot; (prior, antecedent non-existence).

===Shabda===
&quot;Shabda&quot; (शब्द) means relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts. Hiriyanna explains &quot;Sabda-pramana&quot; as a concept which means reliable expert testimony. The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly. He must rely on others, his parent, family, friends, teachers, ancestors and kindred members of society to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other&#x27;s lives. This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through &quot;Sabda&quot; (words). The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the &quot;Sabda&quot; of reliable sources. The disagreement between the schools of Hinduism has been on how to establish reliability. Some schools, such as Charvaka, state that this is never possible, and therefore &quot;Sabda&quot; is not a proper pramana. Other schools debate means to establish reliability.

=== Svatah Pramanya ===
The doctrine of svatah pramanya in Mīmāṃsā emphasizes accepting appearances as they are. It holds that since a cognition initially appears true, it should be accepted as true unless there is concrete evidence to the contrary. If no such evidence ever appears, the cognition is considered genuinely true.

===Relation to Vedanta school===
An interesting feature of the Mīmāṃsā school of philosophy is its unique epistemological theory of the intrinsic validity of all cognition as such. It is held that all knowledge is &quot;ipso facto&quot; true (Skt. &quot;svataḥ prāmāṇyavāda&quot;). Thus, what is to be proven is not the truth of a cognition, but its falsity. The Mīmāṃsākas advocate the self-validity of knowledge both in respect of its origin (&quot;utpatti&quot;) and ascertainment (&quot;jñapti&quot;). Not only did the Mīmāṃsākas make a very great use of this theory to establish the unchallengeable validity of the Vedas, but later Vedantists also drew freely upon this particular Mīmāṃsā contribution.

==Metaphysics and beliefs==
The core tenets of are ritualism (orthopraxy) and anti-asceticism. The central aim of the school is elucidation of the nature of &quot;dharma&quot;, understood as a set ritual obligations and prerogatives to be performed properly.

=== Apaurusheya ===
The term Apaurusheya, central to the Mīmāṃsā school, asserts that the Vedas are not of human origin. Instead, they are considered uncreated, without any specific author, and self-validating in their authority. Jaimini explains in his fifth Mīmāṃsā Sutra that the relationship between words and their meanings in the Vedas is primordial, meaning it has existed since the beginning of time.

===Non-theism===
Mīmāṃsā theorists decided that the evidence allegedly proving the existence of God was insufficient. They argue that there was no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there was no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a God to validate the rituals. Mīmāṃsā argues that the Gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the &quot;mantras&quot; that speak their names. To that regard, the power of the mantras is what is seen as the power of Gods.

===&quot;Dharma&quot;===
Dharma as understood by Pūrva Mīmāṃsā can be loosely translated into English as &quot;virtue&quot;, &quot;morality&quot; or &quot;duty&quot;. The Pūrva Mīmāṃsā school traces the source of the knowledge of dharma neither to sense-experience nor inference, but to verbal cognition (i.e. knowledge of words and meanings) according to Vedas. In this respect it is related to the Nyāya school, the latter, however, accepts only four sources of knowledge (&quot;pramāṇa&quot;) as valid.

The Pūrva Mīmāṃsā school held dharma to be equivalent to following the prescriptions of the Saṃhitās and their Brāhmaṇa commentaries relating the correct performance of Vedic rituals. Seen in this light, Pūrva Mīmāṃsā is essentially ritualist (orthopraxy), placing great weight on the performance of karma or action as enjoined by the Vedas.

===Relation to Vedānta===
Emphasis of Yajnic Karmakāṇḍas in Pūrva Mīmāṃsā is erroneously interpreted by some to be an opposition to Jñānakāṇḍa of Vedānta and Upaniṣads. Pūrva Mīmāṃsā does not discuss topics related to Jñānakāṇḍa, such as salvation (&quot;mokṣa&quot;), but it never speaks against mokṣa. Vedānta quotes Jaimini&#x27;s belief in Brahman as well as in mokṣa:

In Uttara-Mīmāṃsā or Vedānta (4.4.5–7), Bāḍarāyaṇa cites Jaimini as saying (ब्राह्मेण जैमिनिरूपन्यासादिभ्यः) &quot;(The mukta Puruṣa is united with the Brahman) as if it were like the Brahman, because descriptions (in Śruti etc) prove so&quot;.

In Vedānta (1.2.28), Bāḍarāyaṇa cites Jaimini as saying that &quot;There is no contradiction in taking Vaishvānara as the supreme Brahman&quot;.

In 1.2.31, Jaimini is again quoted by Bāḍarāyana as saying that the nirguna (attribute-less) Brahman can manifest itself as having a form.

In 4.3.12, Bādarāyana again cites Jaimini as saying that the mukta Purusha attains Brahman.

In Pūrva Mīmāṃsā too, Jaimini emphasises the importance of faith in and attachment to the Omnipotent Supreme Being Whom Jaimini calls &quot;The Omnipotent Pradhaana&quot; (The Main):

Pūrva Mīmāṃsā 6.3.1: &quot;sarvaśaktau pravṛttiḥ syāt tathābhūtopadeśāt&quot; (सर्वशक्तौ प्रवृत्तिः स्यात् तथाभूतोपदेशात्). The term &quot;upadeśa&quot; here means instructions of the śāstras as taught. We should tend towards the omnipotent supreme being. In the context of Pūrva Mīmāṃsā 6.3.1 shown above, next two sutras becomes significant, in which this Omnipotent Being is termed as &quot;pradhāna&quot;, and keeping away from Him is said to be a &quot;doṣa&quot;, hence all beings are asked to get related (&quot;abhisambandhāt&quot; in tadakarmaṇi ca doṣas tasmāt tato viśeṣaḥ syāt pradhānenābhisambandhāt; Jaimini 6, 3.3) to the &quot;Omnipotent Main Being&quot; (api vāpy ekadeśe syāt pradhāne hy arthanirvṛttir guṇamātram itarat tadarthatvāt; Jaimini 6, 3.2). Karma-Mīmāṃsā supports the Vedas, and Rgveda says that one Truth is variously named by the sages. It is irrelevant whether we call Him as Pradhāna or Brahman or Vaishvānara or Shiva or God.

==History==
The school for some time in the Early Middle Ages exerted near-dominant influence on learned Hindu thought, and is credited as a major force contributing to the decline of Buddhism in India, but it has fallen into decline in the High Middle Ages and today is all but eclipsed by Vedanta.

<doc id="307384" wikidata="Q116971" url="?curid=307384" title="Mohawk people">
<text>The Mohawk, also known by their own name,  (), are an Indigenous people of North America and the easternmost nation of the Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois Confederacy (also known as the Five Nations or later the Six Nations).

Mohawk are an Iroquoian-speaking people with communities in southeastern Canada and northern New York State, primarily around Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. As one of the five original members of the Iroquois Confederacy, the Mohawk are known as the Keepers of the Eastern Door who are the guardians of the confederation against invasions from the east.

Today, Mohawk people belong to the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne, Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte First Nation, Mohawks of Kahnawà:ke, Mohawks of Kanesatake, Six Nations of the Grand River, and Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, a federally recognized tribe in the United States.

At the time of European contact, Mohawk people were based in the valley of the Mohawk River in present-day upstate New York, west of the Hudson River. Their territory ranged north to the St. Lawrence River, southern Quebec and eastern Ontario; south to greater New Jersey and into Pennsylvania; eastward to the Green Mountains of Vermont; and westward to the border with the Iroquoian Oneida Nation&#x27;s traditional homeland territory.

== Mohawk communities==
Members of the Kanienʼkehá:ka people now live in settlements in northern New York State and southeastern Canada.
Many Kanienʼkehá:ka communities have two sets of chiefs, who are in some sense competing governmental rivals. One group are the hereditary chiefs (), nominated by Clan Mother matriarchs in the traditional Mohawk fashion. Mohawks of most of the reserves have established constitutions with elected chiefs and councilors, with whom the Canadian and U.S. governments usually prefer to deal exclusively. The self-governing communities are listed below, grouped by broad geographical cluster, with notes on the character of community governance found in each.

* Northern New York:
** Kanièn:ke (Ganienkeh) &quot;Place of the flint&quot;. Traditional governance.
** Kanaʼtsioharè:ke &quot;Place of the washed pail&quot;. Traditional governance.
* Along the St Lawrence in Quebec:
** Ahkwesáhsne (St. Regis, New York and Quebec/Ontario, Canada) &quot;Where the partridge drums&quot;. Traditional governance, band/tribal elections.
** Kahnawà:ke (south of Montréal) &quot;On the rapids&quot;. Canada, traditional governance, band/tribal elections.
** Kanehsatà:ke (&quot;Oka&quot;) &quot;Where the snow crust is&quot;. Canada, traditional governance, band/tribal elections.
** Tioweró:ton (Sainte-Lucie-des-Laurentides, Quebec). Canada, shared governance between Kahnawà꞉ke and Kanehsatà꞉ke.
* Southern Ontario:
** Kenhtè꞉ke (Tyendinaga) &quot;On the bay&quot;. Traditional governance, band/tribal elections.
** Wáhta (Gibson) &quot;Maple tree&quot;. Traditional governance, band/tribal elections.
** Ohswé:ken &quot;Six Nations of the Grand River&quot;. Traditional governance, band/tribal elections. Mohawks form the majority of the population of this Iroquois Six Nations reserve. There are also Mohawk Orange Lodges in Canada.

Given increased activism for land claims, a rise in tribal revenues due to establishment of gaming on certain reserves or reservations, competing leadership, traditional government jurisdiction, issues of taxation, and the Canadian &quot;Indian Act&quot;, Mohawk communities have been dealing with considerable internal conflict since the late 20th century.

== Language ==
The Mohawk language, or its native name, Kanyen&#x27;kéha, is a Northern Iroquoian language. Like many Indigenous languages of the Americas, Mohawk is a polysynthetic language. Written in the Roman alphabet, its orthography was standardized in 1993 at the Mohawk Language Standardization Conference.

== Name ==

In the Mohawk language, the Mohawk people call themselves the Kanienʼkehá꞉ka (&quot;people of the flint&quot;). The Mohawk became wealthy traders as other nations in their confederacy needed their flint for tool making. Their Algonquian-speaking neighbors (and competitors), the people of &quot;Muh-heck Haeek Ing&quot; (&quot;food area place&quot;), the Mohicans, referred to the people of Ka-nee-en Ka as &quot;Maw Unk Lin&quot;, meaning &quot;bear people&quot;. The Dutch heard and wrote this term as &quot;Mohawk&quot;, and also referred to the Kanienʼkehá꞉ka as &quot;Egil&quot; or &quot;Maqua&quot;.

The French colonists adapted these latter terms as &quot;Aignier&quot; and &quot;Maqui&quot;, respectively. They also referred to the people by the generic &quot;Iroquois&quot;, a French derivation of the Algonquian term for the Five Nations, meaning &quot;Big Snakes&quot;. The Algonquians and Iroquois were traditional competitors and enemies.

==History==
=== First contact with European settlers ===
In the upper Hudson and Mohawk Valley regions, the Mohawks long had contact with the Algonquian-speaking Mohican people who occupied territory along the Hudson, as well as other Algonquian and Iroquoian peoples to the north around the Great Lakes. The Mohawks had extended their own influence into the St. Lawrence River Valley, which they maintained for hunting grounds.

The Mohawk likely defeated the St. Lawrence Iroquoians in the 16th century, and kept control of their territory. In addition to hunting and fishing for centuries the Mohawks cultivated productive maize fields on the fertile floodplains along the Mohawk River, west of the Pine Bush.

On June 28, 1609, a band of Hurons led Samuel De Champlain and his crew into Mohawk country, the Mohawks being completely unaware of this situation. De Champlain made it clear he wanted to strike the Mohawks down after their raids on the neighboring nations. On July 29, 1609, hundreds of Hurons and many of De Champlain&#x27;s French crew fell back from the mission, daunted by what lay ahead. Sixty Huron Indians, De Champlain, and two Frenchmen saw some Mohawks in a lake near Ticonderoga; the Mohawks spotted them as well. De Champlain and his crew fell back, then advanced to the Mohawk barricade after landing on a beach. They met the Mohawks at the barricade; 200 warriors advanced behind four chiefs. They were equally astonished to see each other— De Champlain surprised at their stature, confidence, and dress; the Mohawks surprised by De Champlain&#x27;s steel cuirass and helmet. One of the chiefs raised his bow at Champlain and the Indians. Champlain fired three shots that pierced the Mohawk chiefs&#x27; wooden armor, killing them instantly. The Mohawks stood in shock until they started flinging arrows at the crowd. A brawl began and the Mohawks fell back seeing the damage this new technology dealt on their chiefs and warriors. This was the first contact the Mohawks had with Europeans. This incident also sparked the Beaver Wars.

=== Beaver Wars ===

In the seventeenth century, the Mohawk encountered both the Dutch, who went up the Hudson River and established a trading post in 1614 at the confluence of the Mohawk and Hudson Rivers, and the French, who came south into their territory from New France (present-day Quebec). The Dutch were primarily merchants and the French also conducted fur trading. During this time the Mohawk fought with the Huron in the Beaver Wars for control of the fur trade with the Europeans. Their Jesuit missionaries were active among First Nations and Native Americans, seeking converts to Catholicism.

In 1614, the Dutch opened a trading post at Fort Nassau, New Netherland. The Dutch initially traded for furs with the local Mohican, who occupied the territory along the Hudson River. Following a raid in 1626 when the Mohawks resettled along the south side of the Mohawk River, in 1628, they mounted an attack against the Mohican, pushing them back to the area of present-day Connecticut. The Mohawks gained a near-monopoly in the fur trade with the Dutch by prohibiting the nearby Algonquian-speaking peoples to the north or east to trade with them but did not entirely control this.

European contact resulted in a devastating smallpox epidemic among the Mohawk in 1635; this reduced their population by 63%, from 7,740 to 2,830, as they had no immunity to the new disease. By 1642 they had regrouped from four into three villages, recorded by Catholic missionary priest Isaac Jogues in 1642 as Ossernenon, Andagaron, and Tionontoguen, all along the south side of the Mohawk River from east to west. These were recorded by speakers of other languages with different spellings, and historians have struggled to reconcile various accounts, as well as to align them with archeological studies of the areas. For instance, Johannes Megapolensis, a Dutch minister, recorded the spelling of the same three villages as Asserué, Banagiro, and Thenondiogo. Late 20th-century archeological studies have determined that Ossernenon was located about 9 miles west of the current city of Auriesville; the two were mistakenly conflated by a tradition that developed in the late 19th century in the Catholic Church.

While the Dutch later established settlements in present-day Schenectady and Schoharie, further west in the Mohawk Valley, merchants in Fort Nassau continued to control the fur trading. Schenectady was established essentially as a farming settlement, where the Dutch took over some of the former Mohawk maize fields in the floodplain along the river. Through trading, the Mohawk and Dutch became allies of a kind.

During their alliance, the Mohawks allowed Dutch Protestant missionary Johannes Megapolensis to come into their communities and teach the Christian message. He operated from the Fort Nassau area for about six years, writing a record in 1644 of his observations of the Mohawk, their language (which he learned), and their culture. While he noted their ritual of torture of captives, he recognized that their society had few other killings, especially compared to the Netherlands of that period.

The trading relations between the Mohawk and Dutch helped them maintain peace even during the periods of Kieft&#x27;s War and the Esopus Wars, when the Dutch fought localized battles with other native peoples. In addition, Dutch trade partners equipped the Mohawk with guns to fight against other First Nations who were allied with the French, including the Ojibwe, Huron-Wendat, and Algonquin. In 1645, the Mohawk made peace for a time with the French, who were trying to keep a piece of the fur trade.

During the Pequot War (1634–1638), the Pequot and other Algonquian Indians of coastal New England sought an alliance with the Mohawks against English colonists of that region. Disrupted by their losses to smallpox, the Mohawks refused the alliance. They killed the Pequot &quot;sachem&quot; Sassacus who had come to them for refuge, and returned part of his remains to the English governor of Connecticut, John Winthrop, as proof of his death.

In the winter of 1651, the Mohawk attacked on the southeast and overwhelmed the Algonquian in the coastal areas. They took between 500 and 600 captives. In 1664, the Pequot of New England killed a Mohawk ambassador, starting a war that resulted in the destruction of the Pequot, as the English and their allies in New England entered the conflict, trying to suppress the Native Americans in the region. The Mohawk also attacked other members of the Pequot confederacy, in a war that lasted until 1671.

In 1666, the French attacked the Mohawk in the central New York area, burning the three Mohawk villages south of the river and their stored food supply. One of the conditions of the peace was that the Mohawk accept Jesuit missionaries. Beginning in 1669, missionaries attempted to convert Mohawks to Christianity, operating a mission in Ossernenon 9 miles west of present-day Auriesville, New York until 1684, when the Mohawks destroyed it, killing several priests.

Over time, some converted Mohawk relocated to Jesuit mission villages established south of Montreal on the St. Lawrence River in the early 1700s: Kahnawake (used to be spelled as &quot;Caughnawaga&quot;, named for the village of that name in the Mohawk Valley) and Kanesatake. These Mohawk were joined by members of other Indigenous peoples but dominated the settlements by number. Many converted to Roman Catholicism. In the 1740s, Mohawk and French set up another village upriver, which is known as Akwesasne. Today a Mohawk reserve, it spans the St. Lawrence River and present-day international boundaries to New York, United States, where it is known as the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation.

Kateri Tekakwitha, born at Ossernenon in the late 1650s, has become noted as a Mohawk convert to Catholicism. She moved with relatives to Caughnawaga on the north side of the river after her parents&#x27; deaths. She was known for her faith and a shrine was built to her in New York. In the late 20th century, she was beatified and was canonized in October 2012 as the first Native American Catholic saint. She is also recognized by the Episcopal and Lutheran churches.

After the fall of New Netherland to England in 1664, the Mohawk in New York traded with the English and sometimes acted as their allies. During King Philip&#x27;s War, Metacom, &quot;sachem&quot; of the warring Wampanoag Pokanoket, decided to winter with his warriors near Albany in 1675. Encouraged by the English, the Mohawk attacked and killed all but 40 of the 400 Pokanoket.

From the 1690s, Protestant missionaries sought to convert the Mohawk in the New York colony. Many were baptized with English surnames, while others were given both first and surnames in English.

During the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the Mohawk and Abenaki First Nations in New England were involved in raids conducted by the French and English against each other&#x27;s settlements during Queen Anne&#x27;s War and other conflicts. They conducted a growing trade in captives, holding them for ransom. Neither of the colonial governments generally negotiated for common captives, and it was up to local European communities to raise funds to ransom their residents. In some cases, French and Abenaki raiders transported captives from New England to Montreal and the Mohawk mission villages. The Mohawk at Kahnawake forcibly adopted numerous young women and children to add to their own members, having suffered losses to disease and warfare. For instance, among them were numerous survivors of the more than 100 captives taken in the Deerfield raid in western Massachusetts. The minister of Deerfield was ransomed and returned to Massachusetts, but his daughter was forcibly adopted by a Mohawk family and ultimately assimilated and married a Mohawk man.

During the era of the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years&#x27; War), Anglo-Mohawk partnership relations were maintained by men such as Sir William Johnson in New York (for the British Crown), Conrad Weiser (on behalf of the colony of Pennsylvania), and Hendrick Theyanoguin (for the Mohawk). Johnson called the Albany Congress in June 1754, to discuss with the Iroquois chiefs repair of the damaged diplomatic relationship between the British and the Mohawk, along with securing their cooperation and support in fighting the French, in engagements in North America.

===American Revolutionary War===
During the second and third quarters of the 18th century, most of the Mohawks in the Province of New York lived along the Mohawk River at Canajoharie. A few lived at Schoharie, and the rest lived about 30 miles downstream at the Tionondorage Castle, also called Fort Hunter. These two major settlements were traditionally called the Upper Castle and the Lower Castle. The Lower Castle was almost contiguous with Sir Peter Warren&#x27;s Warrensbush. Sir William Johnson, the British Superintendent of Indian Affairs, built his first house on the north bank of the Mohawk River almost opposite Warrensbush and established the settlement of Johnstown.

The Mohawk were among the four Iroquois people that allied with the British during the American Revolutionary War. They had a long trading relationship with the British and hoped to gain support to prohibit colonists from encroaching into their territory in the Mohawk Valley. Joseph Brant acted as a war chief and successfully led raids against British and ethnic German colonists in the Mohawk Valley, who had been given land by the British administration near the rapids at present-day Little Falls, New York.

A few prominent Mohawk, such as the sachem Little Abraham (Tyorhansera) at Fort Hunter, remained neutral throughout the war. Joseph Louis Cook (Akiatonharónkwen), a veteran of the French and Indian War and ally of the rebels, offered his services to the Americans, receiving an officer&#x27;s commission from the Continental Congress. He led Oneida warriors against the British. During this war, Johannes Tekarihoga was the civil leader of the Mohawk. He died around 1780. Catherine Crogan, a clan mother and wife of Mohawk war chief Joseph Brant, named her brother Henry Crogan as the new Tekarihoga.

In retaliation for Brant&#x27;s raids in the valley, the rebel colonists organized Sullivan&#x27;s Expedition. It conducted extensive raids against other Iroquois settlements in central and western New York, destroying 40 villages, crops, and winter stores. Many Mohawk and other Iroquois migrated to Canada for refuge near Fort Niagara, struggling to survive the winter.

===After the Revolution===
After the American victory, the British ceded their claim to land in the colonies, and the Americans forced their allies, the Mohawks and others, to give up their territories in New York. Most of the Mohawks migrated to Canada, where the Crown gave them some land in compensation. The Mohawks at the Upper Castle fled to Fort Niagara, while most of those at the Lower Castle went to villages near Montreal.

Joseph Brant led a large group of Iroquois out of New York to what became the reserve of the Six Nations of the Grand River, Ontario. Brant continued as a political leader of the Mohawks for the rest of his life. This land extended 100 miles from the head of the Grand River to the head of Lake Erie where it discharges. Another Mohawk war chief, John Deseronto, led a group of Mohawk to the Bay of Quinte. Other Mohawks settled in the vicinity of Montreal and upriver, joining the established communities (now reserves) at Kahnawake, Kanesatake, and Akwesasne.

On November 11, 1794, representatives of the Mohawk (along with the other Iroquois nations) signed the Treaty of Canandaigua with the United States, which allowed them to own land there.

The Mohawks fought as allies of the British against the United States in the War of 1812.

===20th century to present===
In 1971, the Mohawk Warrior Society, also Rotisken’rakéhte in the Mohawk language, was founded in Kahnawake. The duties of the Warrior Society are to use roadblocks, evictions, and occupations to gain rights for their people, and these tactics are also used among the warriors to protect the environment from pollution. The notable movements started by the Mohawk Warrior Society have been the Oka Crisis blockades in 1990 and the Caledonia Ontario, Douglas Creek occupation of a construction site in summer of 2006.

On May 13, 1974, at 4:00 a.m, Mohawks from the Kahnawake and Akwesasne reservations repossessed traditional Mohawk land near Old Forge, New York, occupying Moss Lake, an abandoned girls camp. The New York state government attempted to shut the operation down, but after negotiation, the state offered the Mohawk some land in Miner Lake, where they have since settled.

The Mohawks have organized for more sovereignty at their reserves in Canada, pressing for authority over their people and lands. Tensions with the Quebec Provincial and national governments have been strained during certain protests, such as the Oka Crisis in 1990.

In 1993, a group of Akwesasne Mohawks purchased 322 acres of land in the Town of Palatine in Montgomery County, New York which they named &quot;Kanatsiohareke&quot;. It marked a return to their ancestral land.

===Mohawk ironworkers in New York===

Mohawks came from Kahnawake and other reserves to work in the construction industry in New York City in the early through the mid-20th century. They had also worked in construction in Quebec. The men were ironworkers who helped build bridges and skyscrapers, and who were called skywalkers because of their seeming fearlessness. They worked from the 1930s to the 1970s on special labor contracts as specialists and participated in building the Empire State Building. The construction companies found that the Mohawk ironworkers did not fear heights or dangerous conditions. Their contracts offered lower than average wages to the First Nations people and limited labor union membership. About 10% of all ironworkers in the New York area are Mohawks, down from about 15% earlier in the 20th century.

The work and home life of Mohawk ironworkers was documented in Don Owen&#x27;s 1965 National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;High Steel&quot;. The Mohawk community that formed in a compact area of Brooklyn, which they called &quot;Little Caughnawaga&quot;, after their homeland, is documented in Reaghan Tarbell&#x27;s &quot;Little Caughnawaga: To Brooklyn and Back&quot;, shown on PBS in 2008. This community was most active from the 1920s to the 1960s. The families accompanied the men, who were mostly from Kahnawake; together they would return to Kahnawake during the summers. Tarbell is from Kahnawake and was working as a film curator at the George Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum of the American Indian, located in the former Custom House in Lower Manhattan.

Since the mid-20th century, Mohawks have also formed their own construction companies. Others returned to New York projects. Mohawk skywalkers had built the World Trade Center buildings that were destroyed during the September 11 attacks, helped rescue people from the burning towers in 2001, and helped dismantle the remains of the building afterwards. Approximately 200 Mohawk ironworkers (out of 2,000 total ironworkers at the site) participated in rebuilding the One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. They typically drive the 360 miles from the Kahnawake reserve on the St. Lawrence River in Quebec to work the week in lower Manhattan and then return on the weekend to be with their families. A selection of portraits of these Mohawk ironworkers were featured in an online photo essay for &quot;Time Magazine&quot; in September 2012.

==Contemporary issues==
=== Gambling ===
Both the elected chiefs and the Warrior Society have encouraged gambling as a means of ensuring tribal self-sufficiency on the various reserves or Indian reservations. Traditional chiefs have tended to oppose gaming on moral grounds and out of fear of corruption and organized crime. Such disputes have also been associated with religious divisions: the traditional chiefs are often associated with the Longhouse tradition, practicing consensus-democratic values, while the Warrior Society has attacked that religion and asserted independence. Meanwhile, the elected chiefs have tended to be associated (though in a much looser and general way) with democratic, legislative and Canadian governmental values.

On October 15, 1993, Governor Mario Cuomo entered into the &quot;Tribal-State Compact Between the St. Regis Mohawk First Nation and the State of New York&quot;. The compact allowed the Indigenous people to conduct gambling, including games such as baccarat, blackjack, craps and roulette, on the Akwesasne Reservation in Franklin County under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA).
According to the terms of the 1993 compact, the New York State Racing and Wagering Board, the New York State Police and the St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Gaming Commission were vested with gaming oversight. Law enforcement responsibilities fell under the state police, with some law enforcement matters left to the community. As required by IGRA, the compact was approved by the United States Department of the Interior before it took effect. There were several extensions and amendments to this compact, but not all of them were approved by the U.S. Department of the Interior.

On June 12, 2003, the New York Court of Appeals affirmed the lower courts&#x27; rulings that Governor Cuomo exceeded his authority by entering into the compact absent legislative authorization and declared the compact void  On October 19, 2004, Governor George Pataki signed a bill passed by the State Legislature that ratified the compact as being &quot;nunc pro tunc&quot;, with some additional minor changes.

In 2008 the Mohawk Nation was working to obtain approval to own and operate a casino in Sullivan County, New York, at Monticello Raceway. The U.S. Department of the Interior disapproved this action although the Mohawks gained Governor Eliot Spitzer&#x27;s concurrence, subject to the negotiation and approval of either an amendment to the current compact or a new compact. Interior rejected the Mohawks&#x27; application to take this land into trust.

In the early 21st century, two legal cases were pending that related to Native American gambling and land claims in New York. The State of New York has expressed similar objections to the Dept. of Interior taking other land into trust for federally recognized &#x27;tribes&#x27;, which would establish the land as sovereign Native American territory, on which they might establish new gaming facilities. The other suit contends that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act violates the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution as it is applied in the State of New York. In 2010 it was pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York.

==Culture==

===Social organization===
The main structures of social organization are the clans (). The number of clans vary among the Haudenosaunee; the Mohawk have three: Bear (), Turtle (), and Wolf (). Clans are nominally the descendants of a single female ancestor, with women possessing the leadership role. Each member of the same clan, across all the Six Nations, is considered a relative. Traditionally, marriages between people of the same clan are forbidden. Children belong to their mother&#x27;s clan.

===Religion===
Traditional Mohawk religion is mostly Animist. &quot;Much of the religion is based on a primordial conflict between good and evil.&quot; Many Mohawks continue to follow the Longhouse Religion.

In 1632 a band of Jesuit missionaries now known as the Canadian Martyrs led by Isaac Jogues was captured by a party of Mohawks and brought to Ossernenon (now Auriesville, New York). Jogues and company attempted to convert the Mohawks to Catholicism, but the Mohawks took them captive, tortured, abused and killed them. Following their martyrdom, new French Jesuit missionaries arrived and many Mohawks were baptized into the Catholic faith. Ten years after Jogues&#x27; death Kateri Tekakwitha, the daughter of a Mohawk chief and Tagaskouita, a Roman Catholic Algonquin woman, was born in Ossernenon and later was canonized as the first Native American saint. Religion became a tool of conflict between the French and British in Mohawk country. The Reformed clergyman Godfridius Dellius also preached among the Mohawks.

===Traditional attire===
Historically, the traditional hairstyle of Mohawk men, and many men of the other groups of the Iroquois Confederacy, was to remove most of the hair from the head by plucking (not shaving) tuft by tuft of hair until all that was left was a smaller section, that was worn in a variety of styles, which could vary by community. The women wore their hair long, often dressed with traditional bear grease, or tied back into a single braid.

In traditional dress women often went topless in summer and wore a skirt of deerskin. In colder seasons, women wore a deerskin dress. Men wore a breech cloth of deerskin in summer. In cooler weather, they added deerskin leggings, a deerskin shirt, arm and knee bands, and carried a quill and flint arrow hunting bag. Women and men wore puckered-seam, ankle-wrap moccasins with earrings and necklaces made of shells. Jewelry was also created using porcupine quills such as Wampum belts. For headwear, the men would use a piece of animal fur with attached porcupine quills and features. The women would occasionally wear tiaras of beaded cloth. Later, dress after European contact combined some cloth pieces such as wool trousers and skirts.

===Marriage===
The Mohawk Nation people have a matrilineal kinship system, with descent and inheritance passed through the female line. Today, the marriage ceremony may follow that of the old tradition or incorporate newer elements, but is still used by many Mohawk Nation marrying couples. Some couples choose to marry in the European manner &quot;and&quot; the Longhouse manner, with the Longhouse ceremony usually held first.

== Longhouses ==
Replicas of 17th-century longhouses have been built at landmarks and tourist villages, such as Kanata Village, Brantford, Ontario, and Akwesasne&#x27;s &quot;Tsiionhiakwatha&quot; interpretation village. Other Mohawk Nation Longhouses are found on the Mohawk territory reserves that hold the Mohawk law recitations, ceremonial rites, and Longhouse Religion (or &quot;Code of Handsome Lake&quot;). These include:
* Ohswé꞉ken (Six Nations) First Nation Territory, Ontario holds six Ceremonial Mohawk Community Longhouse.
* Wáhta First Nation Territory, Ontario holds one Ceremonial Mohawk Community Longhouse.
* Kenhtè꞉ke (Tyendinaga) First Nation Territory, Ontario holds one Ceremonial Mohawk Community Longhouse.
* Ahkwesásne First Nation Territory, which straddles the borders of Quebec, Ontario and New York, holds two Mohawk Ceremonial Community Longhouses.
* Kaʼnehsatà꞉ke First Nation Territory, Quebec holds one Ceremonial Mohawk Community Longhouses.
* Kahnawà꞉ke First Nation Territory, Quebec holds three Ceremonial Mohawk Community Longhouse.
* Kanièn꞉ke First Nation Territory, New York State holds one Ceremonial Mohawk Community Longhouse.
* Kanaʼtsioharà꞉ke First Nation Territory, New York State holds one Ceremonial Mohawk Community Longhouse.

<text>The Greenback Party (known successively as the Independent Party, the National Independent Party and the Greenback Labor Party) was an American political party with an anti-monopoly ideology which was active from 1874 to 1889. The party ran candidates in three presidential elections, in 1876, 1880 and 1884, before it faded away.

The party&#x27;s name referred to the non-gold backed paper money, commonly known as &quot;greenbacks&quot;, that had been issued by the North during the American Civil War and shortly afterward. The party opposed the deflationary lowering of prices paid to producers that was entailed by a return to a bullion-based monetary system, the policy favored by the Republican and Democratic parties. Continued use of unbacked currency, it was believed, would better foster business and assist farmers by raising prices and making debts easier to pay.

Initially an agrarian organization associated with the policies of the Grange, the organization took the name Greenback Labor Party in 1878 and attempted to forge a farmer–labor alliance by adding industrial reforms to its agenda, such as support of the 8-hour day and opposition to the use of state or private force to suppress union strikes. The organization faded into obscurity in the second half of the 1880s, with its basic program reborn shortly under the aegis of the People&#x27;s Party, commonly known as the &quot;Populists&quot;. Later, during the early 20th century, parts of the agenda from both parties were accomplished by the Progressives.

==Organizational history==

===Background===

The American Civil War of 1861 to 1865 greatly affected the financial system of the United States of America, creating vast new war-related expenditures while disrupting the flow of tax revenue from the Southern United States, organized as the Confederate States of America. The act of Southern secession prompted a brief and severe business panic in the North and a crisis of public confidence in the Federal government. The government&#x27;s initial illusions of a quick military victory proved ephemeral and in the wake of Southern victories the federal government found it increasingly difficult to sell the government bonds necessary to finance the war effort.

Two 1861 bond sales of $50 million each conducted through private banks went without a hitch, but bankers found the market for the 7.3% securities soft for a third bond issue. A general fear arose that the country&#x27;s gold supply was inadequate and that the nation would soon leave the gold standard. In December runs on deposits began in New York City, forcing banks there to disburse a substantial part of their hard metal reserves. On December 30, 1861, New York banks suspended the redemption of their banknotes with gold. This spontaneous action was followed shortly by banks in other states suspending payment on their own banknotes and the U.S. Treasury itself suspending redemption of its own Treasury notes. The gold standard was thus effectively suspended.

United States Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase had already anticipated the coming financial crisis, proposing to Congress the establishment of a system of national banks, each empowered to issue banknotes backed not with gold but with federal bonds. This December 1861 proposal was initially ignored by Congress, which in February 1862 decided instead to pass the First Legal Tender Act, authorizing the production of not more than $150 million of these legal tender United States Notes. Two additional issues were deemed necessary, approved in June 1862 and January 1863, so that by the end of the war some $450 million of this non-gold-backed currency was in circulation.

The new United States Notes were popularly known as &quot;greenbacks&quot; due to the vibrant green ink used on the reverse side of the bill. A dual currency system emerged in which this fiat money circulated side by side with ostensibly gold-backed currency and gold coin, with the value of the former bearing a discount in trade. The greatest differential in value of these currencies came in 1864, when the value of a gold dollar equaled $1.85 in greenback currency.

Congress finally enacted Treasury Secretary Chase&#x27;s National Bank plan in January 1863, creating a yet another form of currency, also backed by government bonds rather than gold and redeemable in United States Notes. This non-gold-based currency became the functional equivalent of greenbacks in circulation, further expanding the money supply.

With the production of consumer goods impacted by the conversion of factories to wartime production and the expansion of the money supply, the United States of America experienced a period of protracted inflation during the Civil War. Between the years 1860 and 1865, the cost of living nearly doubled. As is the case in all inflationary periods, there were winners and losers created by the significant fall in currency value, with banks and creditors receiving less real value from the loans repaid by debtors. Pressure began to build in the financial industry for a rectification of the weak currency situation.

A change of heads at the Treasury Department in March 1865 proved the occasion for a change of course in American monetary policy. New Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCulloch not only declared himself sympathetic to the banking industry&#x27;s desire for restoration of a gold-based currency, but he declared the resumption of gold payments to be his primary aim. In December 1865, McCulloch formally sought approval from Congress to retire the greenback currency from circulation, a necessary first step towards restoration of the gold standard. In response, Congress passed the Contraction Act of 1866, calling for the withdrawal of $10 million in United States Notes within the first 6 months and an addition $4 million per month thereafter. Substantial contraction of the physical money supply followed.

About $44 million in greenback currency was successfully withdrawn from circulation before a recession in 1867 helped fuel opposition in Congress to the deflationary redemption program. In February 1868, Congress terminated the Redemption Act and a state of what is today known as gridlock emerged, during which Congress refused to either formally leave the gold standard or to redeem its non-gold currency in circulation. Secretary of the Treasury of the Grant administration George S. Boutwell formally abandoned the contraction policy and embraced the ongoing state of political inertia.

Currency policy emerged as a hot topic in national politics, with politically active farmers and representatives of the fledgling national trade union movement endorsing a weak greenback-type currency as conducive to the needs of these groups as debtors. A looser currency supply was seen as a way of breaking the perceived stranglehold on the national economy held by banks and wealthy industrialists. Chief among these supporters of so-called &quot;Greenbackism&quot; was the National Labor Union (NLU), established in 1866. This and other groups began to turn to political action in 1870 in an effort to advance their political agenda, with an August 1870 convention calling for the establishment of the National Labor Reform Party.

Joining organized labor were the organized farmers in the form of the Patrons of Husbandry, commonly known as the Grange. Established in 1867, the Grange concerned itself with the monopoly power exerted by railroads, which used various aggressive pricing mechanisms for its own benefit against the farmers who shipped commodities over its lines. When the Grangers turned to politics around the start of the 1870s, railroad price reform was chief on its agenda, with currency reform making it easier for debtors to repay their loans a distinctly lesser concern.

The Greenback Party would be an alliance of organized labor and reform-minded farmers intent on toppling the political hegemony of the industrial- and banking-oriented Republican Party which ruled the North during the Reconstruction period.

===1873 economic crisis and response===

The late 1860s and early 1870s were a time of frenetic railway construction and associated land speculation. Rather than a managed system of national railroad construction through public works or leaving the construction of lines strictly to market forces, Congress attempted to spur the growth of the industry through the grant of enormous tracts of public lands to privately owned railway companies. In May 1869, the First transcontinental railroad across the North American continent was completed, bringing many localities to within reach of a national market for the first time.

A frenzy to complete additional railway lines to open up new frontier areas for development followed, a situation in which the United States government and the great railroad companies of the day maintained a common interest. In an effort to speed such development, Congress granted cash loans and some 129 million acres (52.2 million hectares) of publicly owned land to subsidize construction.

A great part of this massive stockpile of land needed to be converted into cash by the railways to finance their building activities, since railroad construction was a costly undertaking. New settlement had to be attracted to the virgin lands west of the Missouri River, which had been previously regarded by the public as worthless to the needs of agriculture due to insufficiencies of the soil as well as the arid climate. Millions of advertising dollars were spent by the railway companies promoting the agricultural development of the land which they had to sell. Populations skyrocketed and marginal lands were sold and settled.

In 1873, the economic bubble burst. The Panic began with a crisis in the overextended railroad industry, when the brokerage house Jay Cooke &amp; Company found itself unable to sell enough Northern Pacific Railroad bonds to meet its financial obligations, leading to a default on loans and setting off a financial chain reaction. Runs began on banks, causing a series of bank failures, and manufacturers shuttered their production, laying off workers. Dozens of marginal railroads went bankrupt while unemployment skyrocketed. A lengthy depression ensued, continuing through 1878.

Pressure was placed on Congress to alleviate the business crisis through reinflation of the currency, pitting railroad promoters and the iron industry against Eastern bankers and the merchant elite, who favored a stable, gold-based currency. Although those favoring currency expansion won the day in Congress, which passed an Inflation Bill calling for a $46 million boost in output of National Bank notes that would raise the ceiling on unbacked currency back to $400 million, the legislation was vetoed by President Grant on April 22, 1874.

The next Congress moved in the other direction, with the Republican leadership making use of steamroller tactics in order to finally resolve the dual currency situation through passage of the Specie Payment Resumption Act. Under the plan the government would accumulate a sufficient gold reserve over the next several years through the sale of interest-bearing bonds for gold, using the accumulated metal to redeem the greenback currency on January 1, 1879. This deflationary move further tightened the already contracting economy, moving currency reform higher on the list of objectives of politically minded farmers.

With the Democratic Party still discredited in the minds of many Northerners for its pro-Southern orientation and the Republican Party dominated by pro-gold interests, conditions had become ripe for the emergence of a new political organization to challenge the political hegemony of the two established parties of American politics.

===Establishment===

The Greenback Party emerged gradually from the consolidation of like-minded state-level political organizations of differing names. According to historian Paul Kleppner, the origin of the Greenback Party is to be found in the state of Indiana, where early in 1873 a group of reform-minded farmers and political activists declared themselves free of the two established parties and established themselves as the Independent Party. One of the founding members, John C. Wilde, is cited several times in a northern Michigan newspaper from 1898 explaining the reasons for the beginning of the Party. The group nominated a slate for statewide office, running on a platform which called for expansion of the national currency. (In Wisconsin in the same year, a short-lived Reform Party, also called Liberal Reform Party or People&#x27;s Reform Party, a coalition of Democrats, reform-minded Republicans, and Grangers secured the election of William Robert Taylor as Governor of Wisconsin for a two-year term, as well as a number of state legislators, but it never formed a coherent organization.)

The Indiana Independent organization cast its eyes upon a broader existence the following year, issuing a convention call in August 1874 urging all &quot;greenback men&quot; to assemble at Indianapolis in November to form a new national political party. The result of this call was an undelegated gathering of individuals held in November in Indianapolis which was more akin to an organizational conference than a formal convention. No new party was formally established, but a governing Executive Committee was named for the prospective &quot;National Independent Party&quot;, with the body assigned the task of composing a declaration of principles and issuing another call for a formal founding convention.

Several regional conventions took place in 1875, merging the activities of local political parties towards a single end. Most of those attending these initial gatherings were farmers or lawyers, with few urban wage workers or trade union officials — the union movement having been shattered and atomized following the Panic of 1873.

The party nominated its first national ticket at a convention held in Indianapolis, Indiana in May 1876. The party&#x27;s platform focused upon repeal of the Specie Resumption Act of 1875 and the renewed use of non-gold-backed United States Notes in an effort to restore prosperity through an expanded money supply. The convention nominated New York economics pamphleteer Peter Cooper as its presidential standard-bearer.

Cooper declared to the convention:

The Greenback movement argued that the previous effort of using an unbacked currency had been sabotaged by monied interests, which had prevailed upon Congress to restrict the functionality of the notes — declaring them unsuitable for the payment of taxes or national debt. This inevitably depreciated the value of the unbacked currency when circulated side by side with fully functional gold-backed notes, the Greenback movement argued. Moreover, this differential in values was exploited by speculators, who purchased unbacked currency at a severe discount with gold-backed notes and then pressured Congress into redemption of the same at a 1-to-1 rate — thereby netting the speculator a tidy profit.

The Greenback Party of 1876 drew the support almost exclusively from farmers — few urban workmen cast ballots for the Greenback ticket. The situation changed somewhat in the summer of 1877, however, when a strike movement erupted across the country, leading to the suppression of local strike actions by Federal troops and a radicalization of workers. A myriad of local political organizations, independent not only of the Republican and Democratic Parties but also of the fledgling Greenback Party sprung up around the country, concentrated in the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York.

===Development===

In the late 1870s, the party controlled local government in a number of industrial and mining communities and contributed to the election of 21 members in the United States Congress independent of the two major parties. The movement found particular success at the 1874 elections in Wisconsin, California, Iowa and Kansas.

This led the &quot;Chicago Weekly Tribune&quot; to state that the movement offered, &quot;an opportunity to accomplish something for the country at large — not for the farmers merely, but for all who live by their industry, as distinguished from those who live by politics, speculations and class-legislation.&quot; Frustrated by their inability to get Democrats or Republicans to adopt inflationary monetary policy, southern and western leaders of monetary reform met in Indianapolis and proposed the creation of a new political party for currency reform. They would meet again in Cleveland to formally launch the Greenback Party in 1875. The Greenbackers condemned the National Banking System, created by the National Banking Act of 1863, the harmonization of the silver dollar (Coinage Act of 1873 was in fact the &quot;Crime of &#x27;73&quot; to Greenback), and the Resumption Act of 1875, which mandated that the U.S. Treasury issue specie (coinage or &quot;hard&quot; currency) in exchange for greenback currency upon its presentation for redemption beginning on January 1, 1879, thus returning the nation to the gold standard. Together, these measures created an inflexible currency controlled by banks rather than the federal government. Greenbacks contended that such a system favored creditors and industry to the detriment of farmers and laborers.

In 1880, the Greenback Party broadened its platform to include support for an income tax, an eight-hour day, and allowing women the right to vote. Ideological similarities also existed between the Grange (The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry) and the Greenback movement. For example, both the Grange and the GAP favored a national graduated income tax and proposed that public lands be given to settlers rather than sold to land speculators. The town of Greenback, Tennessee, was named after the Greenback Party about 1882.

The party seems to have made use of slightly different official names in some states, with the organization appearing on the ballot in the November 1880 Sacramento, California city election as the &quot;Greenback Labor and Socialist Party&quot;.

Among its national spokesmen, although not the best known, was Thomas Ewing, Jr., a noted Free State advocate in Kansas before the civil war, a controversial major general of Union forces during the war, and a Republican turned Democrat after the Grant Administration. His national debates on Greenback monetary policy led the party&#x27;s growth and influence as spokesmen against the post-war redevelopment of monopolistic gold-based capitalism. Ewing&#x27;s advice to Andrew Johnson had helped point the administration towards an anti-gold-standard Treasury department.

Ewing served in Congress from 1877 to 1881 during the Hayes administration as a leading spokesman for those national politicians who wanted the nation&#x27;s money supply used to expand commerce and fund westward expansion of the nation, not repay in gold the interest on civil war bonds Eastern bankers had bought to fund much of the civil war effort but whose antebellum lending practices to the South had helped slavery flourish. His 1875 national debates with hard money New York Governor Stewart L. Woodford set the stage for a rapid but brief rise in party national influence.

===Decline and dissolution===

The Greenback Party was in decline throughout the entire Grover Cleveland administration. In the election of 1884, the party failed to win any House seats outright, although they did win one seat in conjunction with Plains States Democrats, James B. Weaver, as well as a handful of other seats by endorsing the Democratic nominee.

In the election of 1886, only two dozen Greenback candidates ran for the House, apart from another six who ran on fusion tickets. Again, Weaver was the party&#x27;s only victory. Much of the Greenback news in early 1888 took place in Michigan, where the party remained active.

In early 1888, it was not clear if the Greenback Party would hold another national convention. The 4th Greenback Party National Convention assembled in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 16, 1888. There were so few delegates who attended that no actions were taken. On August 16, 1888, George O. Jones, chairman of the national committee, called a second session of the national convention. The second session of the national convention met in Cincinnati on September 12, 1888. Only seven delegates attended. Chairman Jones issued an address criticizing the two major parties, and the delegates made no nominations. With the failure of the convention, the Greenback Party ceased to exist.

===Legacy===

Many Greenback activists, including 1880 Presidential nominee James B. Weaver, later participated in the Populist Party. By the middle of the 1880s, Greenback Labor nationally was losing its labor-based support, in part as a result of craft union voluntarism and in part as a result of Irish defections back to the Democratic Party.

Historian Paul Kleppner has observed that one of the traditional functions of third parties in the American political system has been the raising of new issues, the testing of their viability amongst the electorate, and the pressuring of established political parties to appropriate these issues as part of their own electoral agenda. In this the Greenback Party and the People&#x27;s Party which followed it were ultimately successful, moving the Democratic Party to espouse looser monetary policy and an ultimate abandonment of the gold standard.

<text>Hägar the Horrible is the title and main character of an American comic strip created by cartoonist Dik Browne and syndicated by King Features Syndicate. It first appeared on February 4, 1973 (in Sunday papers) and the next day in daily newspapers, and was an immediate success. Following Browne&#x27;s retirement in 1988, his son Chris Browne (May 16, 1952–February 5, 2023) continued the strip until his own death, with artwork by Gary Hallgren. , &quot;Hägar&quot; is distributed to 1,900 newspapers in 56 countries and translated into 12 languages. The strip is a caricature commenting on modern-day life in the United States through a loose interpretation of Viking Age Scandinavian life.

==Overview==
&quot;Hagar the Terrible&quot; was the nickname given to the late Dik Browne by his sons; Browne adapted the name to &quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot; for the purposes of alliteration. After his death, Dik Browne&#x27;s sons changed the title of the strip to &quot;Dik Browne&#x27;s Hägar the Horrible&quot; in tribute. The name is pronounced &quot;Hay-gar&quot; according to Chris Browne.

Hägar (sometimes written &quot;Hagar&quot;) is a shaggy, scruffy, overweight, red-bearded Viking. He regularly raids England and sometimes France. Animation-industry writer Terence J. Sacks notes the juxtaposition of contrary qualities that make Hägar endearing to the reader: &quot;Hägar&#x27;s horned helmet, rough beard and shaggy tunic make him look somewhat like a caveman or Opera-Viking, but you also know Hägar has a soft underbelly occasionally exposed.&quot;

===Setting and format===
The strip is set in the Middle Ages in an unnamed coastal village somewhere in Norway. Hägar&#x27;s Norwegian lineage was revealed at least once in a daily strip (July 18, 1984). Hamlet asks Hägar if he can tell people they&#x27;re Norwegian. Hägar replies that it isn&#x27;t necessary: &quot;It might sound like bragging.&quot;

Although anachronisms occur, they are not deliberate mainstays of the strip, as in other period burlesque strips like &quot;The Wizard of Id&quot;. The strip follows a standard gag-a-day daily format with an extended color sequence on Sundays.

Much of the humor centers around Hägar&#x27;s interactions with his longship crew, especially &quot;Lucky Eddie&quot; (when on voyages or during periodic sacking and looting raids). Sometimes the humor would be at the tavern with the other Vikings, or Hagar dealing with his family, who are not like stereotypical Vikings. Supporting characters include his overbearing, nagging and occasionally jealous wife, Helga; their brilliant and sensitive son, Hamlet; their pretty but domestically hopeless daughter, Honi; Helga&#x27;s pet duck, Kvack; Hägar&#x27;s loyal and clever dog, Snert, and other secondary, recurring characters.

===Illustration style===
&quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot; uses a clear, sparse editorial-style line drawing, with minimal foreground or background detail, shading or embellishment. Observers argue this is likely derived from Dik Browne&#x27;s experience as a courtroom illustrator and illustrator of maps of important World War II battles before 1942, plus his experience as an illustrator (Staff Sergeant) attached to a U.S. Army Engineer unit where he drew technical diagrams, maps, and other documents requiring very clear depictions. Before &quot;Hägar&quot;, Browne was best known for co-creating the comic strip &quot;Hi and Lois&quot; with his partner, &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; creator Mort Walker. Browne was reportedly the real-life inspiration for the character Plato, the intellectual private in &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot;.

===Cast of characters===
Dik Browne based the characters on his family. His son Chris said, &quot;And he was a big man like me. He was three hundred pounds and six feet two and had a flaming red beard.&quot;
* Hägar the Hörrible: the slovenly, overfed Viking protagonist. Hägar is both a fierce warrior and a family man with the same problems as your average modern suburbanite. One running gag involves his exceptionally poor personal hygiene; for example, his annual bath (July 14) is a time of national rejoicing and celebrations. Another source of comedy is Hägar&#x27;s simplistic, childlike cluelessness, often finding himself at odds with his more sensible family members. Much to Hägar&#x27;s chagrin, on the few occasions where he behaves maturely (such as helping Helga in daily tasks or displaying self-control of his titanic appetite), the other characters are often caught off guard, since they are more accustomed to his bumbling and childish attitude. The most notable example was when Helga demanded that Hägar speak the truth at least one time, Hägar agrees and does so, something that pleasantly surprises even God himself, who promptly makes angels play the trumpets in celebration of this &quot;miracle&quot;. 
* Helga: Hägar&#x27;s large-framed, bossy housewife, dressed in operatic, Brünnhilde-like blonde braids and helmet. She is the quintessential maternal &quot;over-mothering&quot; figure. Helga bickers with Hägar over his poor habits—such as forgetting to wash his hands after pillaging, or not wiping his feet before entering the hovel. She is often seen trying to teach her old-fashioned values to her daughter Honi, though Honi never truly &quot;gets&quot; it. Her formidable appearance is based on that of a Wagnerian Valkyrie.
* Lucky Eddie: Hägar&#x27;s first mate, best friend, and lieutenant in Viking raids. Contrary to popular depictions of Vikings as brawny macho warriors, Eddie is a short, skinny, chinless, awkward, and naïve weakling. The ironically-named &quot;Lucky&quot; Eddie is, in fact, so unlucky he can be crushed by a stray rainbow. He wears a funnel rather than a helmet on his head, which he always keeps on because he&#x27;s afraid of squirrels. Unlike Hägar, Eddie is educated enough to be able to read and speak in other languages—though paradoxically this does not give him much advantage over other Vikings or his enemies.
* Hamlet: Hägar and Helga&#x27;s intelligent, clean, obedient, and studious young son is almost always seen reading a book. He shows no interest in becoming a Viking. He wants to be a dentist, which makes him the shame of the family to Hägar, though Helga and Honi are more tolerant and encourage his education. Even when Hägar forces him to practice his Viking skills, he&#x27;s shown to be terrible at them. He is the victim of his would-be girlfriend Hernia&#x27;s unrequited affection. 
* Honi: Hägar and Helga&#x27;s beloved, beautiful, sweet, cheerful 16-year-old daughter—dressed as a young Valkyrie with a winged helmet, metallic breastplate and a long skirt made of chainmail. Honi takes after Hägar&#x27;s side of the family, a fact that her boyfriend Lute sometimes finds intimidating. She&#x27;s a Viking warrior like her father, her weapons of choice are a spear and shield. However, she&#x27;s clueless about traditional &quot;girlish&quot; things, and tends to be overdramatic. Helga is constantly trying to marry her off, as she&#x27;s seen as an &quot;old maid&quot; in their backward community. She was romantically involved with Lute the balladeer from the very beginning, and is the only character that can endure his terrible singing.
* Lute: an inept bard/minstrel/troubadour who can neither play, sing in tune nor rhyme properly, although Lute remains totally oblivious to everyone else&#x27;s perception, and considers himself quite the talent. He is Honi&#x27;s boyfriend, though Honi is in control of their relationship (similar to Helga and Hägar); they are perpetually engaged though they still haven&#x27;t married. His name is in reference to the stringed instrument of the same name, which he is often seen playing (albeit poorly). They broke up.
* Hernia: a young, tomboyish girl deeply infatuated with the sensitive Hamlet, though her love is unrequited, often to her comically melodramatic dismay.
* Snert: Hägar&#x27;s dog; Snert is supposed to be a bird/hunting dog, but the reader gets the impression that most of the time he just doesn&#x27;t feel like working. Snert understands everything Hägar tells him, but usually refuses to do what he&#x27;s told. Sometimes Snert is depicted as having a &quot;wife&quot; and a couple of puppies, but they hardly play any role in the comic. Snert wears a (miniature) Viking helmet like everyone else in Hägar&#x27;s household—including the pets. Snert barks with a Viking accent (&quot;voof&quot;).
* Kvack: the family&#x27;s German duck. Kvack is Helga&#x27;s friend and confidante; she will usually spy on Hägar and quack loudly whenever he does something he&#x27;s not supposed to, such as having another hogshead of &quot;Glögg&quot; or &quot;Wiffleberry wine&quot;, Hägar&#x27;s frequently-imbibed beverages. Obviously, Hägar doesn&#x27;t like Kvack at all, and would like to get rid of her. Being a German duck, Kvack &quot;quacks&quot; with an accent. Later in the strip, she brought home a litter of ducklings, which Helga &quot;mothers&quot; as if they were human grandchildren.
*Dr. Zook: a cowled, druid-like &quot;physician&quot; who gives primarily nutritional and psychiatric advice, and is a notorious and dangerous quack. He wears a hood that conceals his face except for his long nose which sticks out. On a few occasions, his face has at least partially been seen.
*Helga&#x27;s Father: a geriatric Viking whose beard reaches the floor, with a taste for young women.
*Helga&#x27;s Mother: a stereotypically shrewish mother-in-law, with antlers on her helmet.
*The Tax Collector: The King&#x27;s officious emissary. In a running gag, he occasionally shows up accompanied by a soldier with a battle-axe, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re here to collect a special one-time tax for the King.&quot; Which, of course, happens every time Hagar earns so much as a penny.
*Mr. Giggles: a torturer who torments captives by forcible tickling.
*Koyer the Lawyer: an unpleasant but effective barrister.
*The Executioner: often accompanies the Tax Collector.
*Brother Olaf: a monk who unsuccessfully explains to Hägar the concept of sin.
Other recurring minor characters include an unnamed psychic or soothsayer, whom Honi and Hägar regularly consult, a balding waiter at Helga&#x27;s favorite restaurant, &quot;The King of England&quot;, and various Anglo-Saxon raiders who serve as Hägar&#x27;s friends and rivals, such as Dirty Dirk and Mean Max.

An example of one strip highlighting Hägar&#x27;s good intentions but cluelessness: Hägar returns from looting Paris with a present for his wife, Helga. He tells her it was ripped off a tub in a palace. He then turns on the faucet and eagerly encourages her to watch. When nothing happens, Hägar comments, &quot;That&#x27;s funny, when I turned it on in the palace, water came out.&quot;

==Licensing==

*For a brief time in the 1970s, &quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot; had its own brand of sponsored soda, &quot;Sunday Funnies Cola&quot;, which featured Hägar strips printed on the side of the can. It was considered a marketing failure.
*From 1981 until the mid-1990s, a representation of Hägar served as the mascot for the Cleveland State University Vikings.
*In the UK in the late 1980s, Hägar and other characters from the strip were used to advertise Skol Lager beer, produced in Great Britain by Allied Breweries. Hägar appeared on billboards and in a series of popular television commercials. The TV spots were animated and mainly black and white, as per the daily newspaper comic strip, although the actual product always appeared in color.
* From 1989 to 1991, Hägar would once again be used in a soft drink endorsement in a series of radio and TV ads for Mug Root Beer, to far greater success than the Sunday Funnies Cola campaign. Most of the TV ads for Mug were the same ads that had premiered for Skol Lager in the UK, albeit recolored and redubbed to refer to root beer rather than beer.
*In the early 1990s, Hägar was used in print ads for the IBM RISC System/6000 desktop workstation. &quot;The ads equated the machine&#x27;s unprecedented desktop power with that of the conquering hordes.&quot;

=== TV guest appearances ===
Hägar made his first animated appearance in a brief sketch paired with an interview with creator Dik Browne in the special &quot;The Fantastic Funnies&quot; broadcast on CBS May 15, 1980. 
Scott Beach (uncredited) provided the voice while the animation was produced by Bill Melendez and Lee Mendelson.

A live-action Hägar sketch was included in the special &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day Sunday Funnies&quot; broadcast May 8, 1983 on NBC.

=== TV special ===
On November 1st, 1989, an animated television special, &quot;Hägar the Horrible: Hägar Knows Best&quot;, produced by Hanna-Barbera, aired on CBS, based on the strip&#x27;s first plotline in 1973. Hägar returns home from two years of battles—and faces a major culture shock. His son Hamlet has flunked from the Viking Academy, and his daughter Honi is dating a minstrel named Lute instead of Olaf, because unlike Lute, Olaf is a true Viking. Hägar blames Helga for allowing Honi to date Lute and being okay with Hamlet reading books and doing homework. Hägar breaks up Honi and Lute, and trains Hamlet in archery and other Viking venues in a single day. However, after seeing how unhappy his children have become, as well as other Vikings calling Honi and Hamlet weird, Hägar immediately takes charge and sets things right again, with Helga as his somewhat silent, but kind, supporter.
The special starred the voices of Peter Cullen as Hägar, Lainie Kazan as Helga, Lydia Cornell as Honi, Josh Rodine as Hamlet, Jeff Doucette as Lucky Eddie, Don Most as Lute and Frank Welker as Snert, the Narrator, and the Viking Academy&#x27;s Principal.
It is available on DVD within the &quot;Advantage Cartoon Mega Pack&quot; set.

=== Movie project ===
&quot;Variety&quot; reported in 2003 that Abandon Pictures had acquired the film rights to the comic strip and planned a live-action theatrical feature based on the character. In late 2014, Chris Browne confirmed that a deal was made with Sony Pictures to produce a film based on the character.

=== Animated sitcom ===
On November 10, 2020, it was announced a CGI animated series co-produced by King Features and The Jim Henson Company is currently in the works. The series will be animated by Henson Digital Puppetry Studio.

=== Video games ===
&quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot;, a scrolling platform game, was released by Kingsoft for the Amiga in 1991. It was ported to Commodore 64 for the German market.

<doc id="307387" wikidata="Q6942180" url="?curid=307387" title="Music of Michigan">
<text>The music of Michigan is composed of many different genres. The city of Detroit has been one of the most musically influential and innovative cities for the past 50 years, whether in Michigan or anywhere else in the United States. Impressively, for 48 straight years (1959–2007) a greater Michigan-area artist has produced a chart-topping recording. Michigan is perhaps best known for three developments: early punk rock (or proto-punk), Motown, and techno.

Michigan musicians with a #1 Billboard Hot 100 hit include artists from the 1950s: Guy Mitchell (Rockabilly genre) and Bill Haley (of Bill Haley &amp; His Comets); from the 1960s: Del Shannon, The Supremes, The Marvelettes, The Temptations, The Four Tops, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, &quot;The Prince of Soul&quot;; Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Aretha Franklin, &quot;The Queen of Soul&quot; (d. 2018); Mary Wells, Tommy James and the Shondells, and ? and the Mysterians; from the 1970s: Al Green, The Spinners, Grand Funk Railroad, and The Knack; from the 1980s: Madonna, &quot;The Queen of Pop&quot;, Bob Seger, and Ray Parker Jr.; from the 1990s: Aaliyah, &quot;The Queen of Urban Pop&quot;; from the 2000s: Eminem (who has had 10 consecutive #1 albums from &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; in 2000 to &quot;Music to Be Murdered By&quot; in 2020). Eminem was the best-selling artist of the 2000s.

Other Detroit musicians with a #1 album on the Billboard 200 include Kid Rock with &quot;Rock n Roll Jesus&quot; in 2007; Jack White of The White Stripes, with 3 albums (&quot;Blunderbuss&quot; in 2012, &quot;Lazaretto&quot;, and &quot;Boarding House Reach&quot;; Jack White&#x27;s group The Raconteurs also had a #1 album); Big Sean, with 3 consecutive #1 albums, including &quot;Dark Sky Paradise&quot; in 2015; and NF, from northern Michigan, with 2 #1 albums, including one in 2018. Eminem&#x27;s groups D12 and Bad Meets Evil have also had #1 albums. Dej Loaf is the latest hip-hop singer to make national waves. Mike Posner is another notable example. His debut album, &quot;31 Minutes to Takeoff&quot; (2010), includes the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top 10 single &quot;Cooler than Me&quot; as well as the top 20 single &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot;. In 2016 he released his second album, &quot;At Night, Alone.&quot; A remix of his 2015 single &quot;I Took a Pill in Ibiza&quot; from the album peaked in the top 10 on the charts in 27 countries around the world, including hitting number one in many and the top five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States. He has written songs for a great number of fellow artists, and is a member of the alternative hip-hop duo Mansionz. Alice Cooper, &quot;The Godfather of Shock Rock,&quot; had a #1 Billboard 200 album with the hard rock &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot; in 1973. Additionally, the new-age classic rock band Greta Van Fleet, from Frankenmuth, have been nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2019 and won the Best New Artist award from the 2017 Loudwire Music Awards.

==Indigenous music==
==Classical==
Classical music and the arts in Michigan have long been supported by the auto industry and the auto magnates who became rich from it. The Detroit Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1914, is the premier orchestra in the state and performs at Orchestra Hall in Detroit. The Symphony runs the Detroit Youth Symphony, the Elaine Lebenbom Competition for female composers and shares its campus with Detroit&#x27;s performing arts high school. The Sphinx Music Competition for young black and Latino classical musicians is based in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. Interlochen Center for the Arts is an arts and music boarding school in Northern Michigan and also provides summer camps as does the Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp. In 2006, Leonard Slatkin and the University of Michigan School of Music Symphony won a Grammy for &quot;Songs Of Innocence And Of Experience&quot;. Paul Smith, who was born in Calumet, was a composer named a Disney Legend and worked on many Disney films and animations, including &quot;Snow White&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, and &quot;Bambi&quot;. Notable contemporary Michigan classical composers include James Hartway and Augustus O. Hill.

The Detroit Opera House is the site of 4 or 5 fully staged operas yearly as well as a dance series. The opera &quot;Margaret Garner&quot; (by Richard Danielpour and Toni Morrison) was sponsored by and debuted at Detroit. Another work debuted by the Michigan Opera Theatre was &quot;Cyrano&quot; by the company&#x27;s director David DiChiera.

==Folk==
Folklorist Ivan Walton, who taught at the University of Michigan, collected the songs of Great Lakes sailors.

Duane Starcher recorded &quot;Woods and Water: Folk songs from Michigan History&quot;, released in 1965 on Western Michigan University Aural Press. 

The Ark is a folk music venue in Ann Arbor in existence since 1965.

==Blues==
Detroit has had a thriving blues scene (see Detroit blues) for some time, including most famously John Lee Hooker.

==Jazz==
Jazz artists born in Detroit include pianists Tommy Flanagan, Hugh Lawson, Barry Harris, Roland Hanna, Kenny Cox, pianist and composer Alice Coltrane, pianist and vibraphonist Terry Pollard, drummers Louis Hayes, Eddie Locke, Oliver Jackson, Roy Brooks, Frank Gant, Gerald Cleaver, Pheeroan akLaff, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, guitarist Kenny Burrell, trombonist Curtis Fuller, French horn player Julius Watkins, saxophonists J. R. Monterose, Faruq Z. Bey, James Carter, Kenny Garrett, baritone saxophonist Pepper Adams, double bassist Doug Watkins, trumpeter Donald Byrd, harpist Dorothy Ashby, violinist Regina Carter, and singers Sheila Jordan, Della Reese, Barbara Dane, and Dianne Reeves. Drummer Elvin Jones, trumpeter Thad Jones, and pianist Geri Allen were born in Pontiac. Singer Betty Carter was born in Flint. Double-bassist Ron Carter was born in Ferndale.

The Detroit International Jazz Festival was founded in 1980 and features free outdoor concerts in venues in the city.

==R&amp;B/Soul==
Fortune Records was a pre-Motown, Detroit-based, independent record label that specialized in soul, doo-wop, rockabilly, gospel, blues and rock and roll. It was owned by Jack and Devora Brown, a husband and wife business team who would operate the label with help from their son, Sheldon Brown. The label&#x27;s biggest stars included John Lee Hooker, Nolan Strong, Andre Williams and Nathaniel Mayer.
The label would release more than 800 vinyl records before stopping original releases in the 1970s. While Fortune never made it to Motown&#x27;s height of fame, artists like the late Nolan Strong proved to be influential. In his autobiography, Smokey Robinson named Strong as one of his biggest and earliest influences. Andre Williams and Nathaniel Mayer both had career resurgences in the 2000s garage rock scene. Bands like Reigning Sound, Goober &amp; the Peas, and The Black Keys have all cited Fortune artists as influential.

Detroit&#x27;s Motown Records dominated soul music for many years. Musicians included Stevie Wonder, The Temptations, Aretha Franklin (buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Detroit, where The Four Tops are also buried; besides &quot;Respect&quot;, she had another #1 Hot 100 hit with &quot;I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)&quot; in 1987), Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, Martha &amp; the Vandellas, Smokey Robinson, Mary Wells (#1 with &quot;My Guy&quot;), The Supremes and The Jackson 5. All of these artists had a #1 Billboard Hot 100 hit, except Martha &amp; the Vandellas. The Supremes had 12 #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits. The Temptations had 4 #1 Hot 100 hits. Stevie Wonder had 10 #1 Hot 100 hits. Led by Berry Gordy, Motown revolutionized soul and made Detroit one of the American centers of musical innovation. Although many who have never lived in the region incorrectly associate certain music from Michigan as being Detroit-oriented, Motown&#x27;s productions were, in reality, among the limited number of recorded works actually linked to the city itself. Many Motown recordings originated in the city, and many Motown artists were from the city of Detroit, or migrated to the immediate area.

Ready for the World formed in Flint in 1982. They had a Billboard Hot 100 #1 song with &quot;Oh Sheila&quot; in 1985.

==Country==
Country music, especially in the Metro Detroit area, is massively popular in Michigan. Some of the state&#x27;s most well-known country artists include Kid Rock, Uncle Kracker, and Josh Gracin.

==Pop==
1960s pop-rock singer Del Shannon came from Coopersville, near Grand Rapids. He had the #1 Billboard Hot 100 hit &quot;Runaway&quot; in 1961.

Singer Madonna, born Madonna Ciccone in Bay City, later living in the Rochester area (and attending the University of Michigan), rose to be considered the &quot;Queen of Pop&quot; by many. Her long career began in the early 1980s and she continues to top charts today. Madonna had 12 #1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, including &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, from 1984.
Mike Posner, from Oakland County, had the popular song &quot;I Took a Pill in Ibiza&quot; in 2016.

==Rock==

Hank Ballard was an early rock and roll artist born in Detroit, who had success with the 1954 song &quot;Work with Me, Annie&quot;. In 1955, Detroit-native Bill Haley ushered in the rock and roll era with the release of &quot;Rock Around The Clock&quot;. Detroit was a center of the 1960s rock scene, with such legendary bands as The Amboy Dukes (featuring guitarist Ted Nugent), The Bob Seger System, ? and the Mysterians, the MC5, Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels (&quot;Devil With a Blue Dress On&quot;), and Tommy James and the Shondells (&quot;Crimson and Clover&quot;). In the 1970s, Bob Seger, Ted Nugent, Alice Cooper, and Grand Funk Railroad (from Flint, who had a #1 Hot 100 hit with &quot;We&#x27;re an American Band&quot; in 1973) were popular rock stars. The Hideout and other teen clubs in the Detroit suburbs during the mid-1960s were a hotbed for such influential groups as the Fugitives, The Pleasure Seekers/Cradle, the Subterraneans (featuring Detroit native Glenn Frey), and the Underdogs. The Rationals and The Prime Movers formed in Ann Arbor, Unrelated Segments formed in Taylor, Luv&#x27;d Ones formed in Niles, and The JuJus formed in Grand Rapids.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, punk rock pioneers like the MC5 and The Stooges (from Ann Arbor, with lead singer Iggy Pop, born in Muskegon) came from southeastern Michigan. Iggy Pop attended the University of Michigan. These performers had incendiary lyrics and outrageous, highly physical live shows. The Grande Ballroom in Detroit was an important venue for these groups. Saginaw/Bay City&#x27;s ? and the Mysterians, who had a Billboard #1 hit in 1966 with &quot;96 Tears&quot;, are widely credited as influencing many later garage punk bands; the Mysterians&#x27; sound melded Tex-Mex influences and James Brown-style soul. The Dogs formed in 1969, influenced by the MC5 and The Stooges, and were active in the Detroit, New York, and LA proto-punk scenes. Death, from Detroit, was active from 1971 to 1976, with a self-released limited single in 1976 being their only release until 2009, when Drag City began releasing the band&#x27;s unreleased 1970s demo recordings and surviving members reformed the group. 
Rodriguez, from Detroit, began his career in the early 1970s and gained a following in South Africa and Australia. Searching for Sugar Man is a film that documented his life and career. 

In the late 1970s, Detroit had a small new wave scene that included The Romantics (&quot;What I Like About You&quot;) and Sonic&#x27;s Rendezvous Band, who played at a converted supper club called Bookie&#x27;s. The new wave rock scene of the late 1970s also included vinyl record releases by the film-influenced Cinecyde, whose label Tremor Records released singles, EPs, and LPs by the group and many other local, like-minded artists. The Ann Arbor-based group Destroy All Monsters began as an art-oriented experimental group but soon evolved into a hard rock band with a psychedelic edge, prominently due to the presence of Ron Asheton (The Stooges) and Michael Davis (MC5). Vocalist Niagara, a founding group member, would also gain notoriety for her film noir-influenced graphic pop art in later years.

In the 1980s, rock bands that had minor to major attention and/or critical acclaim include The Romantics, Glenn Frey, Discipline, His Name Is Alive, Adrenalin, Seduce, Madam X, and Halloween.

The 1980s also saw Marshall Crenshaw from the Detroit suburb of Berkley, attain fame with his releases on Warner Bros. and an appearance as Buddy Holly in the film &quot;La Bamba&quot;. His 1981 recording, &quot;Someday, Someway&quot;, made the Top 40 in both Billboard and Cash Box in 1982. The Gories are a garage punk band formed in 1986 in Detroit. The trio consists of Mick Collins (of The Dirtbombs), Dan Kroha (of The Demolition Doll Rods), and Peggy O&#x27;Neill. The group originally broke up in 1992, but have reunited since 2009.

In the 1990s, East Lansing band The Verve Pipe rose to brief stardom with the hit &quot;The Freshman&quot;, and Sponge, from Detroit, had moderate national success with a dual-guitar sound reminiscent of the MC5. Romeo native Kid Rock gained national prominence in 1999 with his album &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot; which melded his background as a rapper with other influences from Detroit-based musicians and genres (e.g., Bob Seger, Ted Nugent, and Motown). Uncle Kracker and alternative metal band Taproot also had success in the early 2000s. 

The first decade of the 21st century also saw a further revival of the Detroit garage rock sound, typified by bands such as The White Stripes, The Von Bondies, Gore Gore Girls, The GO 
and The Detroit Cobras.

Notable post-hardcore bands include Chiodos, from Davison; I See Stars, from Warren; For the Fallen Dreams, from Lansing; La Dispute, from Grand Rapids; Gone By Sunset, from Sterling Heights; Famous Last Words, from Petoskey; Flint metalcore bands It Lies Within and King 810; We Came as Romans, from Troy; and I Prevail, from Southfield.

Notable alternative/indie rock bands include Frankenmuth&#x27;s Greta Van Fleet had a No. 3 album on the Billboard 200 in 2018, The People&#x27;s Temple from Lansing, Whirlwind Heat from Grand Rapids, The Hounds Below from Ferndale, and Pop Evil from North Muskegon. 
===Indie===
Jad Fair was born in Coldwater. His Name is Alive and Thunderbirds Are Now! are from Livonia. Windy &amp; Carl are from Dearborn. Wolf Eyes formed in Ann Arbor. Magdelene Rose was born in Flint. Darcy Moran and her live band are all from Metro-Detroit. Multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens was born in Detroit and moved to Petoskey (far northern Lower Peninsula) at age 9. Stevens&#x27; music has allusions and influences from all over the state. He released a state-themed baroque pop album, &quot;Michigan&quot;, in 2003. Sufjan Stevens attended Hope College in Holland. Tally Hall was formed in Ann Arbor with 4 of the 5 members growing up there.

===Hardcore===

The hardcore punk scene had arrived by 1981, and included Detroit bands Negative Approach and Degenerates, as well as Necros, Violent Apathy, Spite (Kalamzaoo), Meatmen, and Crucifucks (Lansing). Tesco Vee, of the Meatmen, launched the first Midwest hardcore record label, Touch &amp; Go. Tesco also helped form an alliance between the Detroit scene and Minor Threat and other Washington, D.C. bands.

==Electronic Music==
Techno was primarily developed in basement studios by &quot;The Belleville Three&quot;, a cadre of African-American men, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, and Juan Atkins, who were attending college at the time near Detroit. Influenced heavily by George Clinton&#x27;s Parliament-Funkadelic, Germany&#x27;s Kraftwerk, and the house music coming out of Chicago at the time, they created a new genre of percussive, entirely synthetic electronic dance music.

In the 1990s, a fusion of Miami bass, techno, and hip-hop called ghettotech arose in Detroit. Some notable artists were DJ Assault and DJ Godfather. Since May 2000, Detroit has also been the home of the hugely popular Detroit Electronic Music Festival and related festivals.

The west coast of Michigan hosts the eight-day Electric Forest Festival each summer since 2008, which features famous EDM DJs and jam bands.

==Hip hop==

In the mid-late 1980s, Awesome Dre and the Hard Core Committee, along with Prince Vince and the Hip Hop Force, were among the first wave of Detroit artists, with Awesome Dre becoming the first to go national with videos receiving regular spins on &quot;Yo! MTV Raps&quot;. Also in the mid-late 1980s came others like D the Great, Detroit&#x27;s Most Wanted, Suavey Spy, Mike Fresh, Ace Lee, Eveready Crew, Esham, J to The D, and Silveree. Some of these acts continued into the 1990s, which saw the emergence of others local hip-hop artists such as AWOL, Smiley, Kaos &amp; Mystro, The DBGz, Goon Squad, Playskule, Bombshell, and Boss; MF 911 followed. Undoubtedly, Michigan&#x27;s most famous hip hop star is Eminem. Eminem has had 4 #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits, including &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; from the film &quot;8 Mile&quot; in 2002. Also from Detroit is his group D12; an artist once under his label, Obie Trice; and another former associate, Royce Da 5&#x27;9&quot;. Other performers include Phat Kat, Danny Brown, Insane Clown Posse, One Be Lo, Guilty Simpson, MaGestik LeGend, The Definition, the late J Dilla and his former group Slum Village, and producer and artist Black Milk. Aaliyah (d. 2001), from Detroit, had a #1 Hot 100 hit with &quot;Try Again&quot; in 2000. She had a #1 album in 2001 after her death with &quot;Aaliyah (album)&quot;. Aaliyah had 4 #1 songs on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart including Are You That Somebody? in 1998. Neighboring Flint made significant contributions to hip hop throughout the 1990s, with artists like MC Breed, Top Authority, and The Dayton Family. Since 2011, Big Sean and Dej Loaf are spearheading a national hip-hop sound for Detroit, with up-and-comers like Che (Formally Detroit Che), whose 2014 BET Hip-Hop Awards Cypher with Lil Mama garnered her national recognition.

<text>According to the Book of Genesis, Hagar was an Egyptian slave, a handmaiden of Sarah (then known as &quot;Sarai&quot;), whom Sarah gave to her own husband Abram (later renamed Abraham) as a wife to bear him a child. Abraham&#x27;s firstborn son, through Hagar, Ishmael, became the progenitor of the Ishmaelites, generally taken to be the Arabs. Various commentators have connected her to the Hagrites (sons of Agar), perhaps claiming her as their eponymous ancestor. Hagar is alluded to, although not named, in the Quran, and Islam considers her Abraham&#x27;s second wife.

== Life ==
=== Abraham and Hagar ===
According to the Bible, Hagar was the Egyptian slave of Sarai, Abram&#x27;s wife (whose names later became Sarah and Abraham). Sarai had been barren for a long time and sought a way to fulfill God&#x27;s promise that Abram would be father of many nations, especially since they had grown old, so she offered Hagar to Abram to be his concubine.

Hagar became pregnant, and tension arose between the two women. Genesis states that Sarai despised Hagar after she had conceived and &quot;looked with contempt&quot; on her. Sarai, with Abraham&#x27;s permission, eventually dealt harshly with Hagar and so she fled.

Hagar fled into the desert on her way to Shur. At a spring en route, an angel appeared to Hagar, who instructed her to return to Sarai and submit to her mistress. Then she was told to call her son Ishmael. Afterward, Hagar referred to God as &quot;El Roi&quot; (variously &quot;god of sight&quot;; &quot;god saw me&quot;; &quot;god who appears&quot;). She then returned to Abram and Sarai, and soon gave birth to a son, whom she named as the angel had instructed.

There is mention of Hagar in the Quran without naming her, which does not declare her a free woman but as a maid of Sarah or Abraham named Hajar.

=== Hagar cast out ===

Later, Sarah gave birth to Isaac, and the tension between the women returned. At a celebration after Isaac was weaned, Sarah found the teenage Ishmael mocking her son (Genesis 21:9). She was so upset by the idea of Ishmael inheriting their wealth that she demanded that Abraham send Hagar and her son away. She declared that Ishmael would not share in Isaac&#x27;s inheritance. Abraham was greatly distressed, but God told Abraham to do as his wife commanded because God&#x27;s promise would be carried out through Isaac; Ishmael would be made into a great nation as well because he was Abraham&#x27;s offspring. Abraham brought Hagar and Ishmael out together. Abraham gave Hagar bread and water then sent them into the wilderness of Beersheba. She and her son wandered aimlessly until their water was completely consumed. In a moment of despair, she burst into tears. God heard her son crying and came to rescue them. The angel opened Hagar&#x27;s eyes and she saw a well of water. He also told Hagar that God would &quot;make a great nation&quot; of Ishmael. Hagar found her son a wife from Egypt and they settled in the Desert of Paran.

The Quranic narrative slightly differs from the Biblical account: it is God alone who commands Abraham to take Hagar and Ishmael down to the desert, later Mecca, and leave them there. Due to the scarcity of water in the desert, it did not take long for both mother and son to suffer from a great thirst, and so Hagar ran between the hills of Safa and Marwah in search of water for her son. After the seventh run between the two hills, an angel appeared before her. He helped her and said that God heard Ishmael cry and would provide them with water, and Hagar found the sacred Zamzam Well. Mecca was later known for its perfection and abundant water and an Arab tribe called the Banu Jurhum settled there with Hagar and her son Ishmael, because of the presence of the water.

==Religious views==
===Rabbinical commentary===

Rabbinical commentators asserted that Hagar was Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter. The midrash Genesis Rabbah states it was when Sarah was in Pharaoh&#x27;s harem that he gave her his daughter Hagar as servant, saying: &quot;It is better that my daughter should be a servant in the house of such a woman than mistress in another house&quot;. Sarah treated Hagar well, and induced women who came to visit her to visit Hagar also. However Hagar, when pregnant by Abraham, began to act superciliously toward Sarah, provoking the latter to treat her harshly, to impose heavy work upon her, and even to strike her (ib. 16:9).

Some Jewish commentators identify Hagar with Keturah (), the woman Abraham married after the death of Sarah, stating that Abraham sought her out after Sarah&#x27;s death. It is suggested that Keturah was Hagar&#x27;s personal name, and that &quot;Hagar&quot; was a descriptive label meaning &quot;stranger&quot;. This interpretation is discussed in the Midrash and is supported by Rashi, Judah Loew ben Bezalel, Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz, and Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura. Rashi argues that &quot;Keturah&quot; was a name given to Hagar because her deeds were as beautiful as incense (hence: ), and/or that she remained chaste from the time she was separated from Abraham— derives from the Aramaic word &quot;restrained&quot;. The contrary view (that Keturah was someone other than Hagar) is advocated by the Rashbam, Abraham ibn Ezra, David Kimhi, and Nachmanides. They were listed as two different people in the genealogies in the Book of Chronicles (1 Chronicles 1:29–33).

==Rabbanic Literature==
According to the Midrash (Gen. R. xlv.), Hagar was the daughter of Pharaoh, who, seeing what great miracles God had done for Sarah&#x27;s sake (Gen. xii. 17), said: &quot;It is better for Hagar to be a slave in Sarah&#x27;s house than mistress in her own.&quot; In this sense Hagar&#x27;s name is interpreted as &quot;reward&quot; (&quot;Ha-Agar&quot; = &quot;this is reward&quot;). She was at first reluctant when Sarah desired her to marry Abraham, and although Sarah had full authority over her as her handmaid, she persuaded her, saying. &quot;Consider thyself happy to be united with this saint.&quot; Hagar is held up as an example of the high degree of godliness prevalent in Abraham&#x27;s time, for while Manoah was afraid that he would die because he had seen an angel of God (Judges xiii. 22), Hagar was not frightened by the sight of the divine messenger (Gen. R. l.c.). Her fidelity is praised, for even after Abraham sent her away she kept her marriage vow, and therefore she was identified with Keturah (Gen. xxv. 1), with allusion to (Aramaic, &quot;to tie&quot;; Gen. R. lxi.). Another explanation of the same name is &quot;to adorn,&quot; because she was adorned with piety and good deeds (l.c.). It was Isaac who, after the death of Sarah, went to bring back Hagar to the house of his father; the Rabbis infer this from the report that Isaac came from Beer-lahai-roi, the place which Hagar had named (Gen. xvi. 14, xxiv. 62; Gen. R. lx.; see commentaries ad loc.).

Other homilies, however, take an unfavorable view of Hagar&#x27;s character. Referring to the report that when she had conceived she began to despise her mistress, the Rabbis say that she gossiped about Sarah, saying: &quot;She is certainly not as godly as she pretends to be, for in all the years of her married life she has had no children, while I conceived at once&quot; (Gen. R. xlv.; Sefer ha-Yashar, Lek Leka). Sarah took revenge (Gen. xvi.) by preventing her intercourse with Abraham, by whipping her with her slipper, and by exacting humiliating services, such as carrying her bathing-materials to the bath (l.c.);she further caused Hagar by an evil eye to miscarry, and Ishmael, therefore, was her second child, as is inferred from the fact that the angel prophesied that she would bear a child (Gen. xvi. 11), while it had been narrated before that she was pregnant (Gen. xvi. 4). It is further inferred, from the words &quot;she went astray&quot; (Gen. xxi. 14, Hebr.), that as soon as she had reached the wilderness she relapsed into idolatry, and that she murmured against God&#x27;s providence, saying: &quot;Yesterday thou saidest: &#x27;I will multiply thy seed exceedingly&#x27; [Gen. xvi. 10]; and now my son is dying of thirst.&quot; The fact that she selected an Egyptian woman as her son&#x27;s wife is also counted against her as a proof that her conversion to Judaism was not sincere, for &quot;throw the stick into the air, it will return to its root&quot; (Gen. R. liii., end). This Egyptian wife is explained in the Targum of pseudo-Jonathan to refer to Khadijaand Fatima, the widow and the daughter of Mohammed (see Zunz, &quot;G. V.&quot; 2d ed., p. 288, note a).

===Christianity===
In the New Testament, Paul the Apostle made Hagar&#x27;s experience an allegory of the difference between law and grace in his Epistle to the Galatians. Paul links the laws of the Torah, given on Mount Sinai, to the bondage of the Israelite people, implying that it was signified by Hagar&#x27;s condition as a bondswoman, while the &quot;free&quot; heavenly Jerusalem is signified by Sarah and her child. The Biblical Mount Sinai has been referred to as &quot;Agar&quot;, possibly named after Hagar.

In addition, in the story of the Samaritan woman at the well the author of the Gospel of John alludes to the ancient story of Hagar to &quot;transports meaning from one text to another&quot;. Similar to the way that Hagar names God &quot;The God Who Sees&quot;, the Samaritan woman gives Jesus a name &quot;by saying, &#x27;I know that Messiah is coming,&#x27; and Jesus confirms, &#x27;I am he, the one who is speaking to you.&#x27;&quot;

Augustine of Hippo referred to Hagar as symbolizing an &quot;earthly city&quot;, or sinful condition of humanity: &quot;In the earthly city (symbolised by Hagar) [...] we find two things, its own obvious presence and the symbolic presence of the heavenly city. New citizens are begotten to the earthly city by nature vitiated by sin but to the heavenly city by grace freeing nature from sin.&quot; This view was expounded on by medieval theologians such as Thomas Aquinas and John Wycliffe. The latter compared the children of Sarah to the redeemed, and those of Hagar to the unredeemed, who are &quot;carnal by nature and mere exiles&quot;.

The story of Hagar demonstrates that survival is possible even under harshest conditions.

===Islam===

Hājar or Haajar () is the Arabic name used to identify the wife of Abraham (Arabic: ) and the mother of Ishmael (Arabic: ). Although not mentioned by name in the Qur&#x27;an, she is referenced and alluded to via the story of her husband. She is a revered woman in the Islamic faith.

According to Muslim belief, she was the Egyptian wife of Ibrāhīm. She eventually settled in the Desert of Paran with her son Ismā&#x27;īl. Hājar is honoured as an especially important matriarch of monotheism, as it was through Ismā&#x27;īl that Muhammad would be born.

Some Modern Muslim scholars are of the opinion that she was never a handmaid of Sarah, rather she was a princess of Egypt who willingly followed Abraham and later married him. They further argue that Hagar and Ishmael were not cast out as claimed by Biblical narrative, but they were settled at Makkah (Paran) for the sake of Allah.

Neither Sarah nor Hājar is mentioned by name in the Qur&#x27;an, but the story is traditionally understood to be referred to in a line from Ibrāhīm&#x27;s prayer in Surah Ibrahim (14:37): &quot;I have settled some of my family in a barren valley near your Sacred House.&quot; While Hājar is not named, the reader lives Hājar&#x27;s predicament indirectly through the eyes of Ibrāhīm. She is also frequently mentioned in the .

According to the , a collection of tales about the prophets, Hājar was the daughter of the King of Maghreb, a descendant of Islamic prophet Salih. Her father was killed by Pharaoh Dhu l-&#x27;arsh (, meaning &quot;he/master of the throne&quot;) and she was captured and taken as a slave. Later, because of her royal blood, she was made mistress of the female slaves and given access to all of Pharaoh&#x27;s wealth. Upon conversion to Ibrāhīm&#x27;s faith, the Pharaoh gave Hājar to Sarah who gave her to Ibrāhīm. In this account, the name &quot;Hājar&quot; (called in Arabic) comes from (Arabic: ), the Arabic for &quot;here is your recompense&quot;.

According to another tradition, Hājar was the daughter of the Egyptian king, who gave her to Ibrāhīm as a wife, thinking Sarah was his sister. According to Ibn Abbas, Ismā&#x27;īl&#x27;s birth to Hājar caused strife between her and Sarah, who was still barren. Ibrāhīm brought Hājar and their son to a land called Paran-aram or (Faran in Arabic, in latter days held to be the land surrounding Mecca). The objective of this journey was to &quot;resettle&quot; rather than &quot;expel&quot; Hājar. Ibrāhīm left Hājar and Ismā&#x27;īl under a tree and provided them with water. Hājar, learning that God had ordered Ibrāhīm to leave her in the desert of Paran, respected his decision. The Muslim belief is that God tested Ibrāhīm by ordering this task.

Hājar soon ran out of water, and Ismā&#x27;īl, an infant by that time, began to cry from hunger and thirst. Hājar panicked and ran between two nearby hills, Al-Safa and Al-Marwah, repeatedly in search for water. After her seventh run, an angel appeared over the location of the Zamzam and then hit the ground with his heel (or his wing) and caused a miraculous well to spring out of the ground. This is called the Zamzam Well and is located a few metres from the Kaaba in Mecca.

The incident of her running between the Al-Safa and Al-Marwah hills is remembered by Muslims when they perform their pilgrimage (Hajj) at Mecca. Part of the pilgrimage is to run seven times between the hills, in commemoration of Hājar&#x27;s courage and faith in God as she searched for water in the desert (which is believed to have then miraculously appeared from the Zamzam Well), and to symbolize the celebration of motherhood in Islam. To complete the task, some Muslims also drink from the Zamzam Well and take some of the water back home from pilgrimage in memory of Hājar.

===Baháʼí traditions===
According to the Baháʼí Faith, the Báb was a descendant of Abraham and Hagar, and God made a promise to spread Abraham&#x27;s seed. The Baháʼí Publishing House released a text on the wives and concubines of Abraham and traces their lineage to five different religions.

==Arts and literature==

Many artists have painted scenes from the story of Hagar and Ishmael in the desert, including Pieter Lastman, Gustave Doré, Frederick Goodall and James Eckford Lauder. William Shakespeare refers to Hagar in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; Act II Scene 5 line 40 when Shylock says &quot;What says that fool of Hagar&#x27;s offspring, ha?&quot; This line refers to the character Launcelot, whom Shylock is insulting by comparing him to the outcast Ishmael. It also reverses the conventional Christian interpretation by portraying the Christian character as the outcast.

Hagar&#x27;s destitution and desperation are used as an excuse for criminality by characters in the work of Daniel Defoe, such as Moll Flanders, and the conventional view of Hagar as the mother of outcasts is repeated in Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s play &quot;Zapolya&quot;, whose heroine is assured that she is &quot;no Hagar&#x27;s offspring; thou art the rightful heir to an appointed king.&quot;

In the 19th century a more sympathetic portrayal became prominent, especially in America. Edmonia Lewis, the early African-American and Native American sculptor, made Hagar the subject of one of her most well-known works. She said it was inspired by &quot;strong sympathy for all women who have struggled and suffered&quot;. In novels and poems Hagar herself, or characters named Hagar, were depicted as unjustly suffering exiles. These include the long dramatic poem &quot;Hagar&quot; by Eliza Jane Poitevent Nicholson (pen name Pearl Rivers), president of the National Woman&#x27;s Press Association; &quot;Hagar in the Wilderness&quot; by Nathaniel Parker Willis, the highest-paid magazine writer of his day; and &quot;Hagar&#x27;s Farewell&quot; by Augusta Moore. In 1913 this was joined by the overtly feminist novel &quot;Hagar&quot;, by the American Southern socialist and suffragist Mary Johnston. Hall Caine gave the name &quot;A Son of Hagar&quot; to 1885 book set in contemporary England and dealing with the theme of illegitimacy.

A similarly sympathetic view prevails in more recent literature. The novel &quot;The Stone Angel&quot; by Margaret Laurence has a protagonist named Hagar married to a man named Bram, whose life story loosely imitates that of the biblical Hagar. A character named Hagar is prominently featured in Toni Morrison&#x27;s novel &quot;Song of Solomon&quot;, which features numerous Biblical themes and allusions. In the 1979 novel Kindred, by Octavia Butler, the protagonist Dana has an ancestor named Hagar (born into slavery) whom we meet towards the end of the novel, as part of Dana&#x27;s time travel back to Maryland in the 19th century. Hagar is mentioned briefly in Salman Rushdie&#x27;s controversial novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, where Mecca is replaced with &#x27;Jahilia&#x27;, a desert village built on sand and served by Hagar&#x27;s spring. Hagar is mentioned, along with Bilhah and Zilpah, in Margaret Atwood&#x27;s &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, a dystopian novel which centres around the women whose duty it is to produce children for their masters, assuming the place of their wives in a rape ceremony based upon the biblical passage. In the recent book of nonfiction, &quot;The Woman Who Named God: Abraham&#x27;s Dilemma and the Birth of Three Faiths&quot;, by Charlotte Gordon provides an account of Hagar&#x27;s life from the perspectives of the three monotheistic religions, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. In 2019, Nyasha Junior published a book on Hagar entitled &quot;Reimaging Hagar: Blackness and Bible&quot; which provides a reception history of Hagar that focuses on interpretations of Hagar as a black woman and particularly those interpretations of Hagar that are made by African Americans.

==Contemporary influence==
===Israel===
Since the 1970s, the custom has arisen of giving the name &quot;Hagar&quot; to newborn female babies. The giving of this name is often taken as a controversial political act, marking the parents as being supporters of reconciliation with the Palestinians and the Arab world, and is frowned upon by many, including nationalists and the religious. The connotations of the name were represented by the founding of the Israeli journal &quot;Hagar: Studies in Culture, Polity and Identities&quot; in 2000.

===African Americans===
Several black American feminists have written about Hagar, comparing her story to those of slaves in American history. Wilma Bailey, in an article entitled &quot;Hagar: A Model for an Anabaptist Feminist&quot;, refers to her as a &quot;maidservant&quot; and &quot;slave&quot;. She sees Hagar as a model of &quot;power, skills, strength and drive&quot;. In the article &quot;A Mistress, A Maid, and No Mercy&quot;, Renita J. Weems argues that the relationship between Sarah and Hagar exhibits &quot;ethnic prejudice exacerbated by economic and social exploitation&quot;.

===Assisted reproduction===
Hagar bearing a child for an infertile woman is an example of what is now called surrogacy or contractual gestation, except in Hagar&#x27;s case she had no choice in the matter. Critics of this and other assisted reproductive technologies have used Hagar in their analysis. As early as 1988, Anna Goldman-Amirav in &quot;Reproductive and Genetic Engineering&quot; wrote of Hagar within &quot;the Biblical &#x27;battle of the wombs&#x27; [which] lay the foundation for the view of women, fertility, and sexuality in the patriarchal society&quot;.

<text>Texas Woman&#x27;s University (TWU) is a public coeducational university in Denton, Texas, with two health science center-focused campuses in Dallas and Houston. While TWU has been fully co-educational since 1994, it is the largest state-supported university primarily for women in the United States. The university is part of the Texas Woman&#x27;s University System. It offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in 60 areas of study across six colleges.

==History==

In the late nineteenth century, several Texas-based groups (including the Texas Press Women&#x27;s Association, the Texas Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs, the Grange, and the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union) began advocating for the creation of a state-supported women&#x27;s college focused on a practical education, including domestic skills young women would need to prepare as wives and mothers. In 1901, after the state Democratic Party adopted the idea as a platform in the upcoming election, the college&#x27;s establishment was authorized by the Texas Legislature. Originally named the &quot;Texas Industrial Institute and College for the Education of White Girls of the State of Texas in the Arts and Sciences&quot;, it opened in Denton in 1902 with a class of 186 students and 14 faculty. With three women on its inaugural board of regents, they became the first women to sit on the governing board of a Texas university. The school was soon renamed the &quot;Girls Industrial College&quot; in 1903 and conferred its first degrees the following year. In 1905, the name changed again to the &quot;College of Industrial Arts&quot; and expanded its programs to include liberal arts, fine arts, and sciences.

Upon its founding, the school was primarily focused on educating rural and small town women seeking vocational training. Since many areas of the state lacked comprehensive high schools, the first two years of CIA&#x27;s curriculum were preparatory; students enrolling with a high school diploma were automatically admitted to the college as juniors. With its home extension program and summer school, the school was the first in Texas to offer instruction in home economics, supplying an overwhelming majority of the state&#x27;s high school teachers in home economics in the early twentieth century. In 1914, CIA implemented its first four-year college curriculum, and the first bachelor&#x27;s degrees were conferred in 1915. By 1929, the college had expanded its programs sufficiently to be accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, the American Association of University Women, and the Association of American Universities, and it began offering its first master&#x27;s degrees in 1930. In 1934, the school underwent another name change to the &quot;Texas State College for Women (TSCW)&quot; to reflect its growing reputation as a premiere institution of higher education for women in the state.

Despite the social and cultural limitations for professional women at the time, the college pioneered several academic programs to meet the needs of a growing postwar economy in Texas and built a national reputation for its programs and research in textiles, food, and nutrition, awarding the college&#x27;s first doctoral degrees in 1953. In 1950, it also developed the first nationally accredited nursing program in the state, opening at the original Parkland Hospital in downtown Dallas in 1954, and joining the Oak Ridge Institute for Nuclear Studies in the 1960s, receiving a series of research grants from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to study the health effects on humans in space flights. In 1956, it established the first building in Texas dedicated solely to the instruction of library sciences. Finally, in 1957, the school changed its name for the fourth time to &quot;Texas Woman&#x27;s University&quot;, and expanded its health sciences programs to a campus in Houston in 1960.

The college also enjoyed a close relationship with Texas A&amp;M University in College Station in the early and mid-twentieth century. As the only gender segregated public colleges in Texas at the time, the schools generated considerable media attention for their institutional-supported fraternizing at major sporting and social events; for several decades, a &quot;Tessie&quot; was named the &quot;Aggie Sweetheart&quot; at A&amp;M&#x27;s football rivalry matchup. The practice fizzled in the 1970s when each school began admitting both male and female students, although the schools do still collaborate in several academic and service programs.

Like most non-HBCU institutions in Texas, the school originally admitted only white students. The university integrated in 1961, admitting its first African-American student, Alsenia Dowells, to study nursing; while Dowells only attended for one year, six more black women enrolled the following year. The university currently boasts a 20% black student population and is also designated as a Hispanic-serving institution, and a member of Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, with more than 25% of its full-time student population identifying as Hispanic or Latina. After nearly six decades as a school for women, TWU began admitting men into its health sciences graduate school in 1972 in response to pending litigation at other universities regarding the Equal Protection Clause. In 1994, in anticipation of changing protocols of single-gender institutions across the United States, the school opened all of its programs to qualified men.

Despite being a co-educational university since 1972, TWU remains overwhelmingly women, with approximately 90% of the student body being such, and it continues to place a heavy emphasis on meeting the educational needs of women. It remains unique among Texas higher education institutions by requiring all undergraduates, regardless of their proposed major or degree, to take three credit hours of multicultural women&#x27;s studies in order to graduate.

=== Denton Campus ===

The university&#x27;s flagship Denton campus consists of 270 acres in Denton, Texas, located approximately forty miles northwest of Dallas. Upon the university&#x27;s founding, the Old Main Building was constructed in 1902 and housed all of the school&#x27;s academic programs and students. The first dormitory opened in 1907, and a second classroom building was constructed in 1911.

During the Great Depression, college president L.H. Hubbard used funds available through the federal Works Projects Administration and Public Works Administration to expand the campus infrastructure, which doubled instructional space, improved local roads and sidewalks, and established regional landmarks such as the Little Chapel in the Woods. In 1938, the campus was gifted the Pioneer Woman statue by the state legislature, commissioned to Leo Friedlander to commemorate the Texas Centennial. A second period of expansion in the 1960s and 1970s established several of the university&#x27;s current campus footprint with more than twenty instructional and administrative buildings. The first system Chancellor, Ann Stuart, was named in 1999 and grew enrollment by 85% and constructed new facilities for the growing kinesiology programs.

Carine M. Feyten was inaugurated as the second Chancellor and the 11th President of Texas Woman&#x27;s University on November 10, 2014. The inaugural theme, “Moving Beyond the Inflection Point: Pioneers for a New Era,” expresses the optimism and determination of the university to reach even greater heights of achievement. Feyten has presided over a third period of significant student growth. Because of the corresponding need for significant facilities expansion, the University had to close down land it previously allowed the community to utilize as a public golf course Another change was moving the student center from Brackenridge Hall (originally the site of the dorm of a same name) into Hubbard Hall, which had originally been built as the central campus dining facility by then President L.H. Hubbard to honor his wife, Bertha Altizer Hubbard

The Denton campus also houses five residence halls, all of which are currently co-educational, including Guinn Hall, the tallest building in Denton.

=== Dallas Campus ===
The T. Boone Pickens Institute of Health Sciences in Dallas is based in the Southwestern Medical District, which also houses Parkland Hospital, Children&#x27;s Medical Center Dallas, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The nursing program began on what is now the Dallas campus. It additionally houses programs in occupational therapy, physical therapy and an MBA. Both a general MBA and a concentration specifically focused on health care are offered. On January 18, 2024, Monica Christopher was named the inaugural president of the Dallas campus, replacing the campus manager.

=== Houston Campus ===
The Houston Campus is located in the heart of the Texas Medical Center district, near the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Texas Children&#x27;s Hospital. It contains TWU&#x27;s Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Nutrition &amp; Food Sciences, Health Care Administration, and MBA programs. Monica Williams became the inaugural Houston Campus President on August 26, 2024 

==Academics==

With more than 500 full-time faculty, approximately 75% of classes have 30 students or fewer. Nationally recognized programs include those in nursing, multicultural and gender studies, library science and information studies, and occupational therapy.
The university is divided into six colleges:
#College of Arts and Sciences provides the bulk of undergraduate instruction and presently is subdivided into Social Sciences and Historical Studies; Language, Culture, and Gender Studies, School of the Arts and Design, School of the Sciences, School of Social Work, Psychology and Philosophy; and General Studies 
#College of Business offers undergraduate programs in accounting, business, business administration, finance, human resource management, management, and marketing, and graduate programs in business administration, healthcare administration, and health systems management.
#College of Health Sciences is supported at the Denton, Houston, and Dallas campuses and includes the Schools of Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy, the School of Health Promotion and Kinesiology, the Department of Communication Sciences and Oral Health, and the Department of Nutrition &amp; Food Sciences.
#College of Nursing was established in 1954, growing to become the second-largest in Texas and one of the largest in the country, offering programs at the baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, and doctoral level. Its doctoral program is the fifth oldest in the United States and remains the largest in the world. In addition to the Bachelor of Science program for students with no prior degree, the college offers a weekend program for students who already have a bachelor&#x27;s degree; the College also has a Registered Nurse to Baccalaureate program (RN to BSN) and a Registered Nurse to Master&#x27;s Program (RN to MS). With campuses in Houston and Dallas, admission is very competitive with the cut-off GPA frequently at 4.0.
#College of Professional Education encompasses Teacher Education, Human Development, Family Studies, and Counseling Literacy and Learning, and the School of Library and Information Studies.
#Graduate School functions as a distinct university component. The Graduate School processes graduate admissions to the university and subsequent academic affairs, including degrees in a variety of programs.

==The Woman&#x27;s Collection==

The second floor of Blagg-Huey Library houses the Woman&#x27;s Collection. Established in 1932 at the suggestion of then-college president L.H. Hubbard, the collection is one of the largest and oldest collections of materials about American women&#x27;s history in the United States. In 1979, it was designated by the Texas legislature to house the official history of women in the state.

Currently, the Woman&#x27;s Collection features one of the largest repositories of women in aviation in the world, housing the official collections of Women Airforce Service Pilots of World War II, the Whirly-Girls International Helicopter Pilots, Women Military Aviators, Association of Women Airline Mechanics, International Society of Women Airline Pilots, and the Air Race Classic, as well as many of its individual members&#x27; collections. Other major archives include the Culinary History and Cookbook Collections, which showcase culinary arts from around the world, and is one of the largest collections in the United States with more than 60,000 books, pamphlets, and menus; the Texas Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame established by the Texas Governor&#x27;s Commission on Women; and the university&#x27;s archives.

The Woman&#x27;s Collection is also the official repository for hundreds of organizations, agencies, and conferences in Texas and the southwest concerned with women&#x27;s rights, agency, and status. It is currently the official archive for the Texas Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs, Texas Association of Women&#x27;s Clubs (formerly Texas Federation of Colored Women&#x27;s Clubs), Philanthropic Educational Organization, Texas Federation of Business and Professional Women, and the Texas chapters of the American Association of University Women and Delta Kappa Gamma, as well as the permanent home for 1981 exhibit about Texas women&#x27;s history produced by the Texas Foundation for Women&#x27;s Resources.

Individual collection highlights include Hilda Gloria Tagle, the first Latina federal judge; Dora Dougherty Strother, aviation psychologist, engineer, and the first woman to fly the B-29 Superfortress; Sarah Weddington, the lead counsel in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, a three-term legislator in the Texas House of Representatives, and an advisor to President Carter who had also regularly taught/lectured at Texas Woman&#x27;s University; and Jean Ross Howard Phelan, aviation lobbyist and founder of the Whirly-Girls.

Many well-known women regularly visit Texas Woman&#x27;s University, including Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and U.S. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, who had previously participated in leadership conferences. Major General Mary Saunders (Ret.), who graduated from TWU in 1970 and became the highest-ranking African-American woman in the United States Air Force, previously served as director of the university&#x27;s Leadership Institute.

Denton campus guests have also included Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, Gloria Steinem, Frances &quot;Sissy&quot; Farenthold, Maya Angelou, and Oprah Winfrey, who visited the campus in 1998 and 2005. Other historic campus visits include readings, performances, and lectures by Edna St. Vincent Millay and Amelia Earhart.

==Centers==
The Institute for Women&#x27;s Health, launched in 1993 as the Center for Research on Women&#x27;s Health, focuses on the health of women and girls in Texas through partnerships with other academic institutions, government agencies, and community organizations. Its programming includes exercise, sports, and nutrition services to students, as well as the greater Denton and Houston communities.

The Jane Nelson Institute for Women&#x27;s Leadership was established in 2018 as a hub to educate Texans, especially young women and girls, about women about leadership, business, politics, and public life. It houses:

* the Center for Women in Government, previously known as the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy.
* the Center for Women Entrepreneurs, launched in 2015, to help create and nurture women-owned businesses in the state through business advising, funding, networking, training, and resources.

It also offers certification programs to qualify as a minority-owned business, including historically disadvantaged populations, underutilized zones, LGBT-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, veteran woman-owned, and woman-owned. 
* the Center for Student Leadership, which coordinates educational programs, professional development opportunities, and scholarships

==Attractions==
===Little Chapel in the Woods===
Built in 1939 and dedicated by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, the Little Chapel in the Woods has been named one of Texas&#x27; most outstanding architectural achievements by the Texas Society of Architects. Designed by leading American architect and Denton resident O&#x27;Neill Ford, recruits from the National Youth Administration constructed the building, while more than 300 students in the college&#x27;s fine arts programs designed and created the building&#x27;s artwork, including the stained glass windows, lighting, woodwork, doors, ceiling beams, and flooring. The stained glass windows depict scenes of &quot;Women Ministering to Human Needs&quot; including nursing, teaching, speech, literature, service, dance, and music. The Chapel is open to the public daily and remains a popular destination for recitals, baptisms, and weddings. The original bridal book contains thousands of names of couples who were married between 1939 and 1979 and is currently on display at the Blagg-Huey Library.

=== Texas Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame ===

Hubbard Hall, the former central dining facility, housed the Texas Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame from 1984 until 2018. It is now on the 2nd floor of the Blagg-Huey Library. Created in 1984 by the Texas Governor&#x27;s Commission on Women, the state-established exhibit honors Texas women who make significant public contributions to the state. Inductees include Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, First Ladies Barbara Bush and Lady Bird Johnson, Governor Ann Richards, Texas First Lady Anita Perry, Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Oveta Culp Hobby, Olympic gold medalist Sheryl Swoopes, astronauts Mae Jemison and Sally Ride, entertainer Selena Quintanilla-Perez, and businesswoman Mary Kay Ash.

===Texas First Ladies Historic Costume Collection===
Established in 1940, the historic costume collection contains original dresses predating Texas statehood by First Ladies of the Texas Republic, as well as those worn by Texas First Ladies to the Governor&#x27;s Inaugural Ball and gowns donated by Presidential First Ladies Mamie Eisenhower, Lady Bird Johnson, Barbara Bush, and Laura Bush. As of 2018, the collection consists of 47 gowns, of which 21 are on a rotating display in the Administration Conference Tower. Each dress has been loaned or donated by various sources to the University, with most dresses and their preservation costs through donations from Texas chapters of Daughters of the American Revolution, the Denton Benefit League, or directly from the First Ladies themselves.

==Athletics==

The university originally offered sports through the Women&#x27;s Recreation Association, joining the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women in 1969 in seven sports: basketball, volleyball, field hockey, tennis, badminton, swimming, and track. Known as the &quot;Tessies,&quot; the school won its first national title at the CIAW National Intercollegiate Track and Field Championship that same year.

In 1979, TWU became the Pioneers; after the CIAW ceased operations in 1982, the university officially joined the NCAA Division II. The Pioneers currently compete in the Lone Star Conference, but only in women&#x27;s sports; the gymnastics team competes in the Division I Midwest Independent Conference. Current competitive programs include:

* Basketball
* Dance
* Soccer
* Volleyball
* Softball
* Gymnastics

<text>Illinois, including Chicago has a wide musical heritage. Chicago is most famously associated with the development of electric (or Chicago-style) blues music. Chicago was also a center of development for early jazz and later for house music, and includes a vibrant hip hop scene and R&amp;B. Chicago also has a thriving rock scene that spans the breadth of the rock genre, from huge stadium-filling arena-rock bands to small local indie bands. Chicago has had a significant historical impact on the development of many rock subgenres including power pop, punk rock, indie rock, emo rock, pop punk, and alternative rock.

Illinois musicians with a number-one &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit include artists from the 1950s: Sam Cooke (&quot;The King of Soul,&quot; d.1964); from the 1960s: The Buckinghams; from the 1970s: Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, The Chi-Lites, The Staple Singers, The Emotions, Minnie Riperton, Styx; from the 1980s: Chicago, Cheap Trick, REO Speedwagon, Survivor, Richard Marx; from the 1990s: R. Kelly; from the 2000s: Kanye West, Twista, Plain White T&#x27;s; from the 2020s: Polo G with &quot;Rapstar&quot;. Most of these artists are from Chicago, with soul singers Sam Cooke, Mavis Staples, Minnie Riperton, and R. Kelly hailing from the South Side. In addition, Chicago musicians with a number-one album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 include bands The Smashing Pumpkins with &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; in October 1995, Disturbed with five number-one consecutive albums from 2002 to 2015 from &quot;Believe&quot; to &quot;Immortalized&quot;, and Fall Out Boy with four number-one albums such as &quot;American Beauty/American Psycho&quot; in 2015; and rappers Common with &quot;Finding Forever&quot; in 2007, Lupe Fiasco with &quot;Lasers&quot; in 2011, Juice Wrld (d.2019 in Chicago) with two number-one albums including &quot;Death Race for Love&quot; in 2019, and Lil Durk with a number-one solo album in 2022. Also, Curtis Mayfield (d.1999) had a number-one &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album with the &quot;Superfly&quot; soundtrack in 1972. Composer Richard A. Whiting 1891-1938

==Indigenous music==
==Blues==

Chicago blues music was developed as black musicians influenced by Delta blues joined the post-World War II migration to the burgeoning industrial city from the deep south, and, seeking a way to be heard in the raucous clubs, turned to electric guitar and other forms of amplified music. The result was a tough, gritty sound that directly led to the creation of rock and roll. As the style developed, artists added more instruments and diversification of styles. Key early Chicago blues artists included Howlin&#x27; Wolf (buried in Hillside, IL near Chicago), Willie Dixon, Bo Diddley and Muddy Waters (d.1983). Chicago would continue to be a hotbed of activity in this genre, with artists including Buddy Guy, Koko Taylor (d.2009), Junior Wells, Son Seals, and others calling the city home and performing regularly.

==Jazz==

Chicago was the first important center of jazz as it left the city of its birth, New Orleans, Louisiana. The name &quot;jazz&quot; (and its early variations &quot;jass&quot; or &quot;jas&quot;) may have first been applied to the music in Chicago in the 1910s, as such hot New Orleans bands as Tom Brown&#x27;s made a hit up north. New Orleans pioneers together with enthusiastic younger musicians from the Midwest gathered in Chicago. The result has sometimes been called &quot;Chicago Style&quot;. The saxophone first became a significant instrument in jazz in Chicago, and the city remained the most vibrant and advanced center of the music through the 1920s.

Famous jazz musicians originally from Illinois include trumpeter Miles Davis (from Alton, Illinois near St. Louis), clarinetist Benny Goodman &quot;The King of Swing&quot;, Gene Krupa, Lee Sims, Ramsey Lewis, and Herbie Hancock, while singers Nat King Cole (d.1965) and Dinah Washington (d.1963) grew up in Chicago. One of early jazz&#x27;s great groups, the Austin High Gang, originated from the western suburbs of Chicago. Sinyan Shen, internationally known for his Shanghai classical repertoire and Shanghai jazz performances based on tonal interests and just intervals, is based in Chicago.

==Folk music==
Burl Ives, hailing from downstate Illinois (and attended Eastern Illinois University), helped popularize folk music, with releases beginning in the 1940s (One of his most enduring hits is &quot;A Holly Jolly Christmas&quot; from 1964).

Chicago was a focal point for the folk music boom of the 1960s and early 1970s.

Another gay bar, Oz, soon opened and began catering to the burgeoning hardcore punk scene as local bands like Naked Raygun, Big Black, Strike Under and, most famously, The Effigies, formed. The next wave of Chicago hardcore was more pure hardcore, as opposed to incorporating many different influences, and included Articles of Faith and Rights of the Accused.

<text>The Arme Planante À Charges Éjectables or Apache ( , ) is a French-developed, air-launched, anti-runway cruise missile manufactured by MBDA France. The SCALP EG missile is based on it, notably featuring similar aerodynamics and stealth. However, the latter has a different propulsion system and carries a single high-penetration warhead instead of the Apache&#x27;s cluster submunitions.

<text>Maurice is a novel by E. M. Forster. A tale of homosexual love in early 20th-century England, it follows Maurice Hall from his schooldays through university and beyond. It was written in 1913–1914 and revised in 1932 as well as 1952–1960 (each version differs from one another in the novel&#x27;s last part). Forster was an admirer of the poet, philosopher, socialist, and early gay rights activist Edward Carpenter and, following a visit to Carpenter&#x27;s home at Millthorpe, Derbyshire in 1913, was inspired to write &quot;Maurice.&quot; The cross-class relationship between Carpenter and his working-class partner, George Merrill, presented a real-life model for that of Maurice and Alec Scudder.

Although Forster showed different versions of the novel to a select few of his trusted friends (among them Siegfried Sassoon, Lytton Strachey, Edward Carpenter, Christopher Isherwood, Xiao Qian and Forrest Reid) throughout the decades, it was published only posthumously, in 1971. Forster did not seek to publish it during his lifetime, believing it to have been unpublishable during that period owing to public and legal attitudes to same-sex love. A note found on the manuscript read: &quot;Publishable, but worth it?&quot; Forster was determined that his novel should have a happy ending, but also feared that this would make the book liable to prosecution while male homosexuality remained illegal in the UK.

There has been speculation that Forster&#x27;s unpublished manuscript may have been seen by D. H. Lawrence and influenced his 1928 novel &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover,&quot; which also involves a gamekeeper becoming the lover of a member of the upper classes.

The novel has been adapted by James Ivory and Kit Hesketh-Harvey as the 1987 Merchant Ivory Productions film &quot;Maurice,&quot; for the stage, and as a 2007 BBC Radio 4 Classic Serial by Philip Osment.

==Plot summary==
Maurice Hall, age fourteen, discusses sex and women with his prep-school teacher Ben Ducie just before Maurice progresses to his public school. Maurice feels removed from the depiction of marriage with a woman as the goal of life.

After returning home, Maurice learns that George, the servant boy whom Maurice used to play with, had left and becomes heartbroken without knowing why. One night, Maurice dreams of a friend who could sacrifice everything for him and vice versa, a friend who would last his whole life.

Some years later, while studying at Cambridge, Maurice befriends a fellow student, Clive Durham. Clive introduces him to ancient Greek writings about same-sex love, including Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;, and after a short time the two begin a romantic but completely platonic relationship—at the one-sided demand of Clive, who&#x27;s a Hellenistic intellectual—which continues until they have left university.

After visiting Greece, Clive falls ill; on recovery, he ends his relationship with Maurice, professing he is heterosexual and marrying a woman. Maurice is devastated, but he becomes a stockbroker, in his spare time helping to operate a Christian mission&#x27;s boxing gym for working-class boys in the East End. Around the same time, Maurice realizes Clive&#x27;s incompatibility with him and comes to terms with their relationship as one that would never satisfy his physical desires, and one that would end badly for both.

He makes an appointment with a hypnotist, Mr. Lasker Jones, in an attempt to &quot;cure&quot; himself. Lasker Jones refers to his condition as &quot;congenital homosexuality&quot; and claims a 50 per cent success rate in curing this &quot;condition&quot;. After the first appointment, it is clear that the hypnotism has failed.

Maurice is invited to stay with the Durhams on their estate after Clive gets married; there works a young under-gamekeeper, Alec Scudder, who becomes interested in Maurice but whom Maurice was completely—though unconsciously—attracted to at first sight. During his stay, Maurice also realizes he has already stopped having feelings for Clive. One night, a despairing Maurice calls out in the darkness to the &quot;friend&quot; from his childhood dream. Believing that Maurice is calling for him, Alec climbs to his window with a ladder and the two make love. 

After their first night together, Maurice panics over giving his first time to an uneducated lower-class man and fears he will be exposed or blackmailed by Alec. He goes to Lasker Jones one more time but the hypnotism fails even more than the first time. On the way home, Maurice finally accepts himself as a homosexual but resolves to stick to his class.

Meanwhile, wounded by Maurice&#x27;s refusal to answer his letters and treating him as just a servant for sexual service, Alec resorts to threatening Maurice in order to get his attention. Maurice finally agrees to meet with Alec at the British Museum in London. They discuss the situation and their respective misunderstandings, but it soon becomes clear that they are in love with each other after both have become tired of hurting each other.

They spend another night together at a hotel. In the morning Alec tells Maurice that he is emigrating to Argentina with his family. Maurice asks Alec to stay with him and indicates that he is willing to give up his social and financial position, as well as his job to live and work with Alec. Alec tells him that will not work but only ruin them both and leaves. After initial torment, Maurice decides to bid Alec farewell at Southampton. He is taken aback when Alec does not show up at the port but immediately realizes what that means. 

In a hurry, Maurice makes for the Durhams&#x27; estate, where the two lovers were supposed to have met before in a boathouse at the request of Alec in his letters. There, he finds Alec, who assumes Maurice had received the telegram Alec had sent to him. Alec had changed his mind and intends to stay with Maurice, telling him that they &quot;shan&#x27;t be parted no more&quot;.

Maurice visits Clive and outlines what has happened with Alec in order to say goodbye to Clive and to his old life. Clive is left speechless and unable to comprehend. Maurice leaves to be with Alec, and Clive never sees him again.

===Original ending===
In the original manuscripts, Forster wrote an epilogue concerning the post-novel fate of Maurice and Alec that he later discarded because it was unpopular among those to whom he showed it. This epilogue can still be found in the Abinger edition of the novel, which also contains a summary of the differences between various versions of the novel.

The Abinger reprint of the epilogue retains Maurice&#x27;s original surname of Hill. (Although the surname had been chosen for the character before geophysicist Maurice Hill was even born, it certainly could not be retained once the latter had become a Fellow of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, Forster&#x27;s own College. It might, of course, have been changed before that time.)

The epilogue contains a meeting between Maurice and his sister Kitty some years later. Alec and Maurice have by now become woodcutters. It dawns upon Kitty why her brother disappeared. This portion of the novel underlines the extreme dislike that Kitty feels for her brother. The epilogue ends with Maurice and Alec in each other&#x27;s arms at the end of the day and discussing seeing Kitty and resolving that they must move on to avoid detection or a further meeting.

==Reception==
Critical reception in 1971 was at best mixed. C. P. Snow in &quot;The Financial Times&quot; found the novel &quot;crippled&quot; by its &quot;explicit purpose&quot;, with the ending &quot;artistically quite wrong&quot; (a near universal criticism at the time). Walter Allen in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; characterised it as &quot;a thesis novel, a plea for public recognition of the homosexual&quot;, which Forster had &quot;wasted&quot; himself doing, instead of an autobiographical work. For Michael Ratcliffe in &quot;The Times,&quot; it was &quot;the least poetic, the least witty, the least dense and the most immediately realistic of the six novels&quot;. Philip Toynbee in &quot;The Observer&quot; found the novel &quot;deeply embarrassing&quot; and &quot;perfunctory to the point of painful incompetence&quot;, prompting him to question &quot;whether there really is such a thing as a specifically homosexual sensibility&quot;. Toynbee went on to state that he could &quot;detect nothing particularly homosexual about &quot;Maurice&quot; other than it happens to be about homosexuals&quot;.

Somewhat more positively, Paddy Kitchen in &quot;The Times Educational Supplement&quot; thought that the novel &quot;should be taken on the terms it was conceived and not as some contender to... &quot;Howards End&quot;&quot;. In delineating &quot;a moral theme&quot;, Forster was in Kitchen&#x27;s view &quot;the ideal person&quot;. V.S. Pritchett in &quot;The New Statesman&quot; found the character of Alec &quot;a good deal better drawn&quot; than Mellors in &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;, although found the dull Maurice, shorn of Forster&#x27;s &quot;intelligence and sensibility&quot;, to be hardly believable. Cyril Connolly in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; found &quot;considerable irony&quot; in the fact that it is Maurice, not Clive, the &quot;sensitive young squire&quot; who &quot;turns out to be the incurable&quot;.

For George Steiner in &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; the modest achievement of &quot;Maurice&quot; served to magnify the greatness of &quot;A Passage to India&quot;:
Subtlest of all is Forster’s solution of the problem of &#x27;physical realization.&#x27; In &quot;Maurice&quot;, this basic difficulty had lamed him. Unlike Gide or Lawrence, he had found no sensuous enactment adequate to his vision of sex. Gesture recedes in a cloying mist. The mysterious outrage in the Marabar caves is a perfect solution. Though, as the rest of the novel will show, &#x27;nothing has happened&#x27; in that dark and echoing place, the force of sexual suggestion is uncompromising. As only a true writer can, Forster had found his way to a symbolic action richer, more precise than any single concrete occurrence.

==Adaptations==
The novel was made into a film &quot;Maurice&quot; (1987), directed by James Ivory and starring James Wilby as Maurice, Hugh Grant as Clive, and Rupert Graves as Alec.

A stage adaptation, written by Roger Parsley and Andy Graham, was produced by SNAP Theatre Company in 1998 and toured the UK, culminating with a brief run at London&#x27;s Bloomsbury Theatre. Shameless Theatre Company staged another production in 2010 at the Above the Stag Theatre in London. Above the Stag staged it again in September/October 2018, as part of the theatre&#x27;s first season in their new premises. It was directed by James Wilby. The US premiere opened on 24 February 2012 at the New Conservatory Theatre Center in San Francisco.

A retelling and continuation of the novel by William di Canzio, titled &quot;Alec&quot;, was published in 2021.

<doc id="307406" wikidata="Q17108603" url="?curid=307406" title="Music of Minnesota">
<text>The music of Minnesota began with the native rhythms and songs of Indigenous peoples, the first inhabitants of the lands which later became the U.S. state of Minnesota. Métis fur-trading voyageurs introduced the chansons of their French ancestors in the late eighteenth century. As the territory was opened up to white settlement in the 19th century, each group of immigrants brought with them the folk music of their European homelands. Celtic, German, Scandinavian, and Central and Eastern European song and dance remain part of the vernacular music of the state today.

Ethnic music has influenced and developed into modern folk music, and American musical genres such as gospel music, blues and jazz also are part of the state&#x27;s musical fabric. Musicians, such as the Andrews Sisters and Bob Dylan, often started in Minnesota but left the state for the cultural capitals of the east and west coasts, but in recent years the development of an active music industry in Minneapolis has encouraged local talent to produce and record at home. The city&#x27;s most influential contributions to American popular music happened in the 1980s, when the city&#x27;s music scene &quot;expanded the state&#x27;s cultural identity&quot; and launched the careers of acclaimed performers like the multi-platinum pop singer Prince. The Replacements and Hüsker Dü set off the national alternative rock boom of the 1990s. In the 1990s and 2000s, the Twin Cities played a role in the national hip hop scene with artists such as Atmosphere and Brother Ali.

The Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra was founded in the early 1900s, and by the 1930s it had attained international stature in performance and recording. Since renamed the Minnesota Orchestra, it regained much of its former renown in the first decade of the 21st century. Classical music &quot;aficianados&quot; also enjoy and support the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, the only full-time chamber orchestra in the nation. Choral groups and community ensembles are located in many communities. The state&#x27;s educational system provides comprehensive programs in music education. The nation&#x27;s largest public radio network provides classical and other music programming regionally and to the nation, and independent public stations program a variety of college, folk, and new music.

== History ==
The music of Minnesota has its roots with the music of Indigenous peoples of the area. Traditional arrangements are generally based around vocal, percussive and dance music; Dakota folk songs can be celebratory, martial or ceremonial. Early European settlers (French and Métis voyageurs) brought French chansons, which they sang while traveling along their fur trade routes. These songs were described by one visitor as &quot;light, airy &amp; graceful&quot;, and were often adapted to the rhythm of their paddles while canoeing. Later European settlers also brought with them traditional folk and classical music, especially choral and Christian-themed music, opera, and varieties of ethnic folk music including Slavic and Scandinavian styles. Modern-day traditional dance music is based mostly around schottisches, polkas and waltzes with instrumentation including fiddle, mandola, accordion and banjo.

The first singing school in Minnesota opened in St. Anthony (now part of Minneapolis) in 1851. The Plymouth Congregational Church of Minneapolis began a singing group in 1857, followed by the first such club for women only, the Lorelei Club (later the Ladies&#x27; Thursday Musical Chorus), in 1892.
Thousands of Norwegians settled in Minnesota in the last half of the 19th and first quarter of the 20th century. Subcultures formed based around village of origin (&quot;bygde&quot;), and then formed organizations to maintain their home dialect and musical traditions. These organizations held annual meetings (&quot;stevne&quot;) which featured folk dancing, singing, fiddling and poetry. In the late 1860s, male choirs with Norwegian and Swedish singers formed in cities and Lutheran colleges in Minnesota. These choirs sang a variety of popular and patriotic songs, hymns and folk tunes. In the 1880s, these choirs inspired the organization of singing societies that sponsored music festivals; in 1886, five singing clubs joined to become the Union of Scandinavian Singers, and the Norwegian Singers Association of America has met biannually since 1910.

The end of the 19th century also saw the foundation of two long-running music groups, the Thursday Musical Chorus and the Apollo Men&#x27;s Musical Group. Two of the most important Minnesota musical institutions were founded in the early 20th century, namely the MacPhail School of Violin (1907, later becoming the MacPhail Center for Music) and the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (1903, later the Minnesota Orchestra).

Minneapolis became a home for vaudeville comedy known as &quot;bondkomik&quot; (rustic humor), which featured multi-act plays, dances, songs and monologues. Vaudeville shows usually ended with social dancing. Minneapolis&#x27; most famous performers were the Norwegian-descended Eleonora and Ethel Olson and Ernest and Clarence Iverson (Slim Jim &amp; the Vagabond Kid), and Swedish immigrant Hjalmar Peterson, whose company dominated the stage for two decades before the Great Depression. General enthusiasm for Scandinavian musicals diminished in the face of intense propaganda and agitation toward foreign influence following the end of World War I, a process which was accelerated by the economic decline of the 1930s, and by the outbreak of World War II. Rural and regional dance music slowly died out, and became largely unknown. During this era, however, the &quot;Leikarring&quot; movement (song-dances without instrumental accompaniment) began. &quot;Leikarring&quot; celebrated national Norwegian folk dance and song through musical societies like Minnesota&#x27;s &quot;Norrona Leikarring&quot;.

== Education ==

Minnesotan law provides that public elementary and middle schools offer at least three and require at least two courses in the following four arts areas: dance, music, theater and visual arts. Public high schools must offer at least three and require at least one of the following five arts areas: dance, media arts, music, theater or visual arts. Students may take music at the elementary and middle school ages, and many choose to take the subject as an elective in high school, where schools often organize marching bands, choruses and other performance opportunities. The Perpich Center for Arts Education is a school of choice which draws students from across the state, and has an extensive modern and classical music education program.

The MacPhail Center for Music employs instructors from all over the world, who teach classes on 35 different instruments, the Suzuki method, and art therapy, to more than 7,200 students each year at 45 locations.

Higher education in music is an important part of the programs at several of Minnesota&#x27;s universities, including the University of Minnesota, which offers the Bachelor of Music degree in music education, therapy or performance, and graduate degrees in education, conducting and musicology. The School of Music also offers masters and doctorate degrees. The Duluth campus offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts in musical theatre. McNally Smith College of Music, a college of contemporary music based in Saint Paul, offered Bachelor of Music degrees in music performance, recording technology, and music business, and Associates Degrees and diploma programs in recording technology as well as the nation&#x27;s first diploma in hip hop. McNally Smith College of Music closed in December 2017 due to a lack of funds.

== Venues ==
Large venues for popular national music acts in Minnesota include the Target Center, Xcel Energy Center, and US Bank Stadium. Northrop Auditorium on the University of Minnesota&#x27;s main campus has a capacity of about 3,000, and hosts a variety of music and arts events. Among these is the University of Minnesota Marching Band&#x27;s annual indoor concert series, which have been performed at the venue since 1961. The Armory and Roy Wilkins Auditorium also fill the need for mid-sized arenas at capacities of roughly 8,000 and 5,000 respectively.

Classical music is heard at Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis, a 2,500-seat auditorium &quot;justly renowned for its rich, lively acoustics&quot;, and St. Paul&#x27;s 1,900-seat Ordway Center for the Performing Arts. Older traditional theaters seating about 2,000 include Orpheum Theatre, Pantages Theatre, and State Theatre, all in Minneapolis, and the Ordway Center. The Guthrie Theater holds over 1,000, and The Cedar Cultural Center can seat 465.
First Avenue, an influential music club in downtown Minneapolis, was opened as &quot;The Depot&quot; in 1970, and went through several name changes until it became &quot;First Avenue &amp; 7th Street Entry&quot; in 1980. Its history of launching renowned acts such as Prince solidifies its importance in the current local scene and in Minnesota music history.
The owners of First Avenue also operate the Palace Theatre in St. Paul.

Mid-sized clubs also comprise a large part of the Twin Cities music scene. One popular club is the Myth Nightclub (Also referred to as Myth Live) in Maplewood, a suburb of St. Paul. Numerous bands/artists have performed there including Akon, All American Rejects, Fall Out Boy, Lifehouse, Maroon 5, Melt-Banana, and many more renowned bands. Others include the Cabooze and the Amsterdam Bar &amp; Hall, all of which host all-ages shows as long as they meet local curfew laws (Although some may be listed as 15+ or 16+ for legal liability reasons involving hardcore dancing and other forms of moshing). A notable St. Paul venue that serves local musicians is Minnesota Music Cafe; opened in 1997 it continues to offer live music 7 days a week.

Youth music venues, many of which operate as youth centers by day, include The Garage in Burnsville, Depot Coffee House in Hopkins, Enigma Teen Center in Shakopee, and on some occasions the Apple Valley Teen Center. Also, a few venues catering to crowds of all ages, now gone, are remembered as significant to the Twin Cities music scene. These include the Foxfire Coffee Lounge in downtown Minneapolis and the Fireball Espresso Café in Falcon Heights, St. Paul.

Other defunct but historically important venues include the Pence Opera House, the Coffeehouse Extempore or Extemporé, Jay&#x27;s Longhorn Bar, and the Uptown Bar. The Prom Ballroom and Treasure Inn in Saint Paul and the Marigold Ballroom and the Flame Cafe in Minneapolis featured prominent jazz, rock, country and other bands in the mid-20th century.

Outside of the Twin Cities Metro Area important venues include the NorShor Theatre in Duluth, Chisholm&#x27;s Ironworld U.S.A. (renamed the Minnesota Discovery Center), the Mayo Civic Center in Rochester, the Verizon Center in Mankato, and Ralph&#x27;s Corner, for many years one of the premier indie rock clubs in the Fargo-Moorhead area. These venues are often played by hard rock bands such as Halestorm and Avenged Sevenfold that tend to draw more in &quot;B-Markets&quot;.

== Radio ==

AMPERS is a state-wide association of independently-owned noncommercial stations that play music by local artists. These stations include KAXE, KBEM-FM, KFAI, KMOJ, KMSU, KMSK, KQAL, KSRQ, KUMM, KUOM (Radio K), KVSC, WDSE-FM and WTIP.

Minnesota Public Radio&#x27;s KCMP &quot;The Current&quot; also plays the music of Minnesota artists.

==Recording studios and record stores==
Minneapolis has been home to several important recording studios. The first studio in the state was Kay Bank, established by Amos Heilicher (who with his brother Daniel did &quot;rack jobbing&quot;, jukebox distribution, and owned the Musicland chain), Vern Bank, and studio engineer Bruce Swedien in 1955. The studio recorded hits from The Trashmen (&quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot;), Dave Dudley (&quot;Six Days on the Road&quot;), The Underbeats, The Chancellors, The High Spirits, and The Castaways (&quot;Liar, Liar&quot; in 1965). Kay Bank helped popularize Soma Records and a distinctive style based on using three-track recording and echo effects.

Herb Pilhofer and Tom Jung worked at Kay Bank before founding the world&#x27;s first digital recording studio, Sound 80 in 1969. Sound 80 recorded numerous artists over the years, ranging from Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; to works from Dave Brubeck. The studio now is the headquarters of Orfield Laboratories, whose anechoic chamber, is labeled the world&#x27;s &quot;quietest room&quot; by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as of 2012. Orfield lab also achieved the designation for their friends at Sound 80 as &quot;the world&#x27;s first digital recording studio&quot; in the 2006 Guinness World Records. The two main studios are still fully intact, and they are filed for historic designation by the State and the Federal Government.

Other important studios in Minneapolis include the Dove studio, which released several cult classic psychedelic and garage rock recordings in the 1960s, Blackberry Way, founded by Paul Stark, who would later co-found the Twin/Tone record label. ESP Woody McBride&#x27;s record label &quot;Communique&quot; and its subsidiaries &quot;Sounds&quot; and &quot;Head in the Clouds&quot; had released 100 records by 1998.

Prince&#x27;s Paisley Park Studios was used both by Prince and for outside music production by artists such as Madonna, Boy George, the Fine Young Cannibals and Paula Abdul. The facility was also used for commercial production purposes like TV spots and movies, including 1993&#x27;s &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot;. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis founded Flyte Tyme on Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis in 1985 and then moved to a complex in Edina, Minnesota, before relocating to Santa Monica, California, in 2004.

Flowers Studio in Minneapolis, founded in 1998 by the late Ed Ackerson, leader of the alternative rock bands Polara and the 27 Various, has hosted many notable musicians including the Jayhawks, The Replacements, Motion City Soundtrack, Golden Smog, and Soul Asylum.

The Twin Cities are home to a vibrant independent record store scene, including Treehouse Records (previously known as &quot;Oar Folkjokeopus&quot; and &quot;North Country Music&quot;), the Electric Fetus (also in Duluth and Saint Cloud), and Cheapo. Let It Be Records, although its storefront has closed, still sells vinyl in occasional public sales and by mail order. The now-defunct Northern Lights Music (and before it, Harpo&#x27;s/Hot Licks) also carried many local and alternative artists during the 80s and 90s on Hennepin above 6th Street on Block E and at other metro locations in St. Paul&#x27;s Midway, on White Bear Avenue (St. Paul) and Burnsville. The downtown Minneapolis Northern Lights store later moved to the former location of Music City, a longtime retail music store, at 700 Hennepin Avenue. The Midway Northern Lights location survives today as &quot;Urban Lights&quot; under different ownership, specializing in urban/funk/rap.

==Genres==
===Classical, choral and opera===

Minnesota is home to many active classical music organizations old and new.

Orchestral music in Minnesota is anchored by two major professional orchestras in the Twin Cities, several in other urban centers, and numerous other ensembles. The Minnesota Orchestra was founded in 1903 as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra. Although it was among the first to perform on the radio and to record, it initially was not known as one of the country&#x27;s great orchestras. In the 1930s, Eugene Ormandy transformed it into an excellent ensemble and expanded its repertory, making it the most-recorded orchestra in the United States, and giving it an international reputation. Other illustrious conductors included Dimitri Mitropoulos and Antal Dorati. Osmo Vänskä, a Finnish conductor, music director since 2003, took the orchestra into its second century. Its live performances and recordings in a program of the complete works of Ludwig van Beethoven have been received with enthusiasm, the group has been called &quot;brilliant&quot;, and a critic has stated the musicians are enjoying &quot;their first golden age&quot; since the days of Ormandy and Mitropoulos. Another critic wrote for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; of a concert in 2010 and its &quot;uncanny, wrenching power, the kind you hear once or twice a decade&quot; and thought that that day the Minnesota Orchestra was &quot;the greatest orchestra in the world&quot;. The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra is the only full-time professional chamber orchestra in the country, and also tours and records. Professional orchestral ensembles outside the Twin Cities include the Duluth Superior Symphony Orchestra and the Rochester Symphony Orchestra and Chorale.

The Twin Cities&#x27; oldest major choral society is The Bach Society of Minnesota (f. 1932). &quot;The New York Times International Datebook&quot; calls the Christmas performance of the St. Olaf College choir &quot;one of the five significant global holiday events&quot;. Another major choral ensemble, VocalEssence, has done much to expand the national choral repertoire, with artistic director Philip Brunelle commissioning more than 100 new works for chorus.

For 42 years until 1986, the Metropolitan Opera was in seasonal residence at Northrop Auditorium during its spring tour. Opera is now staged by the Minnesota Opera, co-founded as Center Opera by Dominick Argento in 1963, as part of the Walker Art Center. With an early reputation as &quot;progressive (and) &#x27;alternative&#x27;&quot;, the Minnesota Opera began to include traditional works in its repertory when it merged with Saint Paul Opera in 1975. Today, the Twin Cities are home to other groups such as the Picnic Operetta, Really Spicy Opera, An Opera Theatre, Journey North Opera, Raison d&#x27;Etre Opera, while Duluth is home to Lyric Opera of the North. 

The proliferation of church, amateur, and professional choirs in Minnesota has given the state the nickname &quot;Land of 10,000 Choirs&quot;. The Minnesota Boychoir (f. 1962) is the oldest continuously operating Boys Choir in Minnesota and is currently under the leadership of Mark Johnson. The Boychoir has been involved with the Minnesota Orchestra, The Orpheum Theatre, The Zion dance company, as well as other regional and international tours. 

=== Film Scores ===
In addition to numerous composers and recording artists participating in film scoring, the Twin Cities are home to the annual Film Score Fest (f. 2014), which showcases new original, short films and their soundtracks through live orchestral performances.

=== Folk ===

Minnesota is home to many ethnic groups, who brought with them the folk music of their homelands. When these immigrants settled in rural farming areas, their communities retained Old World social and religious patterns that gave a context for music performance. These ethnic communities frequently settled near each other, in Minnesota and in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, North Dakota and South Dakota, and their musical and cultural identities blurred. Norwegians and Swedes frequently lived near each other in Minnesota, and Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian music merged into Scandinavian music. This music is perceived as a type of old-time music, which also developed from the area&#x27;s German, Irish, English, Polish, Czech, and other Northern and Central European musics.
Norwegian folk dance (&quot;bygdedanser&quot;) includes participatory social dances and dances performed for an audience like &quot;springar&quot;, &quot;gangar&quot; and &quot;halling&quot;. The Norwegian &quot;gammeldans&quot; tradition, and those of other ancestries, continues in ethnic communities in Minnesota, where waltzes, schottisches or &quot;reinlander&quot;, and polkas are newer forms of old-time music. Vocal music includes short poetic songs called &quot;stev&quot;, emigrant ballads which expressed nostalgia for Norway and express hope, despair and loss about life in the United States. By the 1930s the Finnish epic &quot;Kalevala&quot; was still read and sometimes sung.

For those whose social life centered on churches where music was prohibited by the Pietist and other movements, music was sometimes done at home or disguised as a game. For others, secular, socialist and temperance halls became the community center where bands could include women. Musical accompaniment includes the accordion, violin, guitar, bass guitar, piano, harmonica, organ, banjo and mandolin. The Norwegian Hardanger fiddle or &quot;hardingfele&quot; tradition almost died out during the 1970s and then experienced a resurgence.
Bob Dylan, a Duluth native, became the first major mainstream solo star from Minnesota in the 1960s, known for his unique lyricism and folk-rock style. He spent a brief period in Minneapolis during 1959–1961, attending the University of Minnesota, where he played shows at the Ten O&#x27;Clock Scholar on the West Bank of the University of Minnesota Minneapolis campus. He was associated with Dinkytown, a bohemian area near the campus, where he listened to a wide variety of folk and blues. As of 2007, Dylan maintained a home in Minnesota. Bob Dylan the &quot;King of Folk-Rock&quot; had 5 #1 albums on the Billboard 200 from 1974 to 2009, including &quot;Planet Waves&quot; in &#x27;74.

The city&#x27;s local folk scene produced a few well-known performers in the 1960s, besides Dylan who spent much of his early career based in New York, including the guitarist Leo Kottke and the trio Koerner, Ray &amp; Glover. Folk music continues to be a major part of the Minnesota music scene, and is broadcast by the &quot;Prairie Home Companion&quot;, a radio show hosted by author Garrison Keillor; the Red House record label is the most influential local label for folk, and releases records by Ostroushko and Greg Brown, among others. Boiled in Lead who formed during the 1980s are still performing.

===Gospel===
Minnesota is a creative center of the gospel music tradition. Robert Robinson, a musical treasure who has been called &quot;the Pavarotti of Gospel&quot; and whose voice has been called &quot;too big for radio&quot;, is the executive and artistic director of the Twin Cities Community Gospel Choir, which &quot;Minnesota Monthly&quot; said is the state&#x27;s most-decorated gospel group.

Produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the Sounds of Blackness won three Grammy Awards for their music and have performed three times for audiences of 1 billion: at the 1994 World Cup, the 1996 Summer Olympics and the 1998 World Figure Skating Championships. Former Sounds of Blackness lead Ann Nesby has top-five hits on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Songs charts and is the grandmother of American Idol finalist Paris Bennett.

===Blues===

The blues tradition has been practiced in Minnesota for decades, notably by Lazy Bill Lucas and Percy Strother who lived and performed in Minneapolis. Willie Murphy, who replaced Willie Walker in Willie &amp; The Bees was named &quot;one of the three charter members of the Minnesota Music Hall of Fame, along with Bob Dylan and Prince,&quot; according to &quot;Blues on Stage&quot;, who added, &quot;the Minnesota Music Association has given more nominations and awards to Willie and his groups than anyone else&quot;.

Other players gained loyal fans. Called &quot;The Voice&quot; by Tony Glover, Doug Maynard and his band backed Bonnie Raitt in 1982. Until he died at age 40, Maynard could &quot;break a note into two and three parts simultaneously so that it sounded like he was harmonizing with himself&quot;. Larry Hayes, formerly of the Lamont Cranston Band, wrote &quot;Excusez Moi Mon Cheri&quot; which The Blues Brothers recorded. James Samuel &quot;Cornbread&quot; Harris, who collaborated with Augie Garcia and is the father of Jimmy Jam, is one of the area&#x27;s senior players.

===Jazz===

Jazz has been alive in the state since World War II when the Andrews Sisters from Minneapolis recorded the song &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy&quot; which Bette Midler covered decades later. Local radio host Leigh Kamman covered jazz for more than sixty years, with vintage recordings and interviews with jazz artists.

Pamela Espeland of &quot;MinnPost.com&quot; has chronicled many of the 3,500 live jazz performances in the Twin Cities during 2009. Pianist Ethan Iverson and bassist Reid Anderson join Happy Apple drummer David King in The Bad Plus, who have performed during Christmas for ten years at the Dakota Jazz Club, a well-known local jazz venue. Composer and pianist Carei Thomas recently celebrated his 70th birthday at the Walker Art Center.

&quot;No list of Minnesota music would be complete without mention of jazz great Jeanne Arland Peterson and her five children, Linda, Billy, Ricky, Patty, and Paul, as well as grandson Jason, who recently celebrated 22 years of performing their holiday shows.&quot; Dave Koz said, &quot;There is no family in the world quite like the Petersons. First of all, there&#x27;s like 700 of &#x27;em, and each one is more talented than the rest.&quot;

Born, raised and residing in Minnesota, guitarist Reynold Philipsek performs gypsy jazz music as a solo artist, and with Minnesota gypsy jazz acts East Side, The Twin Cities Hot Club, and Sidewalk Café.

Maria Schneider, born in Windom, is a composer and bandleader who studied music theory and composition at the University of Minnesota.

Other musicians that live and play in Minnesota:

* Anthony Cox
* Eric Gravatt
* Leslie Vincent

=== Soul/R&amp;B ===

Minneapolis became noted as a center for rhythm and blues (R&amp;B) in the 1980s, when the multi-talented star Prince (d. 2016) rose to fame. The city had little history in African American popular music, such as R&amp;B, until Prince made his debut in 1978, eventually achieving five #1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 with &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot;, &quot;Kiss&quot;, &quot;Batdance&quot; and &quot;Cream&quot;. Prince also had eight #1 hits on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart from 1979 to 1991. He became the architect of the Minneapolis sound, a funk, rock and disco-influenced style of R&amp;B, and inspired a legion of subsequent performers, including the Prince-related acts The Time, Wendy &amp; Lisa and Vanity 6. Curtiss A, who opened for Prince the first time Prince played First Avenue in 1980, at first thought that it was nice of Prince to let him open and then later realized: &quot;You know: &#x27;You guys think this is the top thing in town? Well, here: Minneapolis got a brand new bag.&#x27;&quot;

Prince fired Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis from funk group The Time in 1983 because their production career began overtaking their roles in the band. Their Flyte Tyme Productions began to gain national attention, and excelled at mainstream urban contemporary music, which had often been shunned by critics. The pair&#x27;s first mainstream breakthrough was Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Control&quot; in 1986, which propelled her career and spawned numerous projects seeing the writing/production team work with artists as varied as Twin Cities acts Mint Condition, Alexander O&#x27;Neal and Sounds of Blackness, to internationally-established acts Michael Jackson, New Edition, Boyz II Men, Patti LaBelle, and Human League. Morris Day gained R&amp;B hits &quot;Oak Tree&quot; and &quot;Color of Success&quot; in 1985. Also in 1985, Jesse Johnson&#x27;s Revue had R&amp;B hits &quot;Be Your Man&quot; and &quot;Can You Help Me&quot; and Johnson produced Ta Mara &amp; the Seen&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Dance&quot; that same year.

In 1980, Steven Greenberg and Cynthia Johnson, recording as Lipps Inc. at Sound 80, recorded &quot;Funkytown&quot;, which reached #1 on both the U.S. and disco charts. The song became a cultural touchstone; Homer Simpson of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; said the song moved him like few others, and the song turned into the biggest seller in the history of the PolyGram label. During the mid-1980s, eight children of the Wolfgramm family became The Jets, who enjoyed eight top 10 hits. In 1998, Minneapolis R&amp;B group Next had a #1 Hot 100 hit with &quot;Too Close&quot;.

=== Rock ===

Rock and roll has a long history in the state. Garcia is remembered from the 1950s as the godfather of Minnesota rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. Called by &quot;Billboard&quot; &quot;one of the top 10 most consistent chartmakers ever&quot;, Bobby Vee, who had 38 songs in the Hot 100 charts, continued to tour with his sons, The Vees, until he died. From the 1960s, a series of psychedelic and garage rock singles have become collector&#x27;s items, including work of Mankato, Minnesota&#x27;s The Gestures, The Litter&#x27;s &quot;Action Woman&quot;, &quot;Faces&quot; by T. C. Atlantic and &quot;Trip Thru Hell&quot; by the C. A. Quintet. &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot; by The Trashmen reached #4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1963, &quot;Liar, Liar&quot; by The Castaways charted at number 12 in 1965, and the song &quot;Evil Woman (Don&#x27;t Play Your Games With Me)&quot; by the Minneapolis hard rock band Crow made the Billboard Top 20 in 1969.

While attending the University of Minnesota in the late 1970s, Yanni played keyboards and synthesizers in several Twin Cities rock bands. He joined the band Chameleon in the early 1980s and enjoyed moderate regional commercial success before embarking on his solo new-age music career.

Largely only known locally for new wave, The Suburbs were released under the local Twin/Tone Records label in 1978, and opened shows for Iggy Pop and The B-52&#x27;s. The Suicide Commandos helped to galvanize a punk, new-wave community based at first out of Jay&#x27;s Longhorn Bar.

Prior to the evolution of punk in the 1970s, there was little rock and roll tradition from Minneapolis, which author Steven Blush attributed to a lack of anything to &quot;rebel against&quot;, noting that it was Minneapolis&#x27; friendly atmosphere that made future hardcore punk musicians &quot;crazy and rebellious&quot;. &quot;Every A&amp;R person in New York was present at CBs while The Replacements joyously flushed the set down the toilet, doing nothing but fractions of other people&#x27;s songs,&quot; said Peter Jesperson who recorded them for Twin/Tone.
In the mid-1970s, local musicians in the Minneapolis area began producing popular and innovative acts. Many signed to major record labels, and by the mid-1980s, some had achieved national prominence. The first female rock bands, Vixen from Saint Paul went on to success in Los Angeles and from Minneapolis, Têtes Noires released three albums. The hardcore punk scene grew with The Replacements and Hüsker Dü, who started too early to profit from, but were pivotal in, the development of alternative rock. The Replacements, who &quot;might be the most legendary&quot; Minnesota rock musicians, eventually achieved some limited mainstream success, which led to member Paul Westerberg&#x27;s solo career, while Hüsker Dü started on local Reflex Records and became the first hardcore outfit to sign to a major label. Soul Asylum was originally a Minneapolis hardcore band called Loud Fast Rules, who played with bands like Willful Neglect, Man Sized Action, Rifle Sport and Breaking Circus; they mixed funk and thrash metal with other influences. The Twin Cities rock scene came to national prominence by 1984, when the &quot;Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s critics poll, Pazz and Jop, named three Minneapolis recordings among the top ten of the year: Prince&#x27;s &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, The Replacements&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot;, and Hüsker Dü&#x27;s &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;.

The late 1980s saw new sounds coming out of the state, when two singles from electronic band Information Society, &quot;What&#x27;s On Your Mind? (Pure Energy)&quot; and &quot;Walking Away&quot;, were MTV favorites. The Jayhawks are a long-lived country-roots rock band who started in the mid-1980s. Another group to form about the same time was Babes in Toyland, an early quasi-riot grrl band. Many groups of the 1980s and 1990s eventually split up, and a number of other bands formed from the remnants. Bob Mould left Hüsker Dü after it imploded in 1988, to head Sugar and do solo projects. Trip Shakespeare eventually transformed into Semisonic, who gained popularity in the late 1990s with the song &quot;Closing Time&quot;. Other prominent, recent rock acts from Minnesota include slowcore band Low and indie folk/bluegrass band Trampled by Turtles, both from Duluth, experimental rock band Cloud Cult and indie rockers Tapes &#x27;n Tapes, both from Minneapolis.
In the 2000s, Minnesota produced a number of acts such as Motion City Soundtrack, Owl City, Quietdrive, Sing It Loud and some metal and hardcore acts such as For All Those Sleeping, After the Burial, Write This Down and Four Letter Lie. Some of these acts like Motion City Soundtrack and Owl City went on to have minor mainstream success, Owl City gained a #1 Hot 100 hit with &quot;Fireflies&quot; in 2009. Emo pop-punk acts, such as Tiny Moving Parts, have been published in &quot;Alternative Press.&quot;

=== Hip hop ===
The Twin Cities region is home to a thriving underground hip hop scene, due largely to the presence of Rhymesayers Entertainment. Rhymesayers&#x27; artists, including Eyedea &amp; Abilities, Brother Ali, Los Nativos, Musab, and, most notably, Atmosphere, began to receive national attention in the late 1990s.

Heiruspecs won &quot;City Pages&quot; &quot;Best Live Artist&quot; in 2004, and in the same year Doomtree won &quot;Best Hip Hop Artist&quot;. For the past several years, through 2008, the scene owed some of its success to the annual Twin Cities Celebration of Hip Hop sponsored by Yo! The Movement and the website D. U. Nation. In 2014 Manny Phesto was given &quot;Best MN Releases&quot; title by Pitchfork Media and was credited by XXL with getting Ghosface Killah and Action Bronson to agree on something. In 2019, Lizzo had a #1 Hot 100 hit with &quot;Truth Hurts&quot;. &quot;

=== Electronic dance music ===
Two locally and internationally-recognized Minneapolis electronic dance music artists are Woody McBride and Freddy Fresh (who walks a line with hip hop).
==Music about Minnesota==
Several composers and performers have featured the state in their works. Classical composer Ferde Grofe depicted Minnesota in his Mississippi Suite. John Philip Sousa wrote &quot;Foshay Tower-Washington Memorial March&quot; for the dedication of the Foshay Tower in 1929. Sonja Thompson recorded &quot;Dan Patch Two-Step&quot;, and Vern Sutton, Charlie Maguire, Peter Ostroushko and Ann Reed have recorded songs celebrating the Minnesota State Fair. Tom Waits released two songs about Minneapolis, &quot;Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis&quot; (&quot;Blue Valentine&quot; 1978) and &quot;9th &amp; Hennepin&quot; (&quot;Rain Dogs&quot; 1985). In 1987, The Silencers released &quot;A Letter from St. Paul&quot;. In 1997, The Mountain Goats released a song entitled &quot;Minnesota&quot; on their album &quot;Full Force Galesburg&quot;. Lucinda Williams recorded &quot;Minneapolis&quot; (&quot;World Without Tears&quot; 2003). In 1975, Northern Light reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts when they released a song titled &quot;Minnesota&quot; that sang the praises of the state&#x27;s natural beauty. In 2012, Ben Kyle released a song titled &quot;Minneapolis&quot; that illustrates the close relationship between St. Paul and Minneapolis.

<text>.nl is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the Netherlands. It is one of the most popular ccTLDs with over six million registered .nl domains .

When cwi.nl was registered by Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica on 1986-05-01, .nl became the first active ccTLD outside the United States.

==Registry==
Since 31 January 1996, .nl domains are registered by the (SIDN, in English: Foundation for Internet Domain Registration Netherlands), based in Arnhem. Most registrars are ISPs, IT service bureaus and media service bureaus, but several large enterprises with many brand names have also become a registrar, or participant as SIDN calls them, which is a quite uncommon phenomenon in the domain name industry. Registrars have to pay SIDN a fee for each domain since 1 April 1996, until then registration was free. SIDN does not deal directly with registrants. In the early days, most of the registrants were universities and research departments of large companies, such as .

==Second-level domains==
Official second-level domains do not exist. A number of companies have taken the opportunity to register domains like co.nl and com.nl, using them to sell third-level domains. These are not affiliated with SIDN.

Individuals were allowed to register a second-level .nl domain since 2003. As a forerunner, individuals were allowed to register a third-level domain since 2000. Such &#x27;personal domains&#x27; had the form of . They never became popular, and registration has been suspended since 2006. Because there were only around 500 of such domains registered, in contrast to about 5 million second-level domains, SIDN announced the discontinuance of personal domains as of 2008 on 4 July 2007.

==Technical limitations==
Unlike the majority of top level domains, .nl requires each nameserver to use a unique IP address. There must be at least two nameservers set, meaning at least two different IP addresses must be used. Other TLDs with this requirement are .ca and .cn.

==Other country-code TLDs under the Kingdom of Netherlands==
* .an – ccTLD for the former multi-nation Netherlands Antilles federation
* .aw – ccTLD for Aruba
* .bq – ccTLD for the Caribbean Netherlands (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba)
* .cw – ccTLD for Curaçao
* .sx – ccTLD for Sint Maarten

<doc id="307408" wikidata="Q1495775" url="?curid=307408" title="Primary and secondary gain">
<text>Primary gain and secondary gain, and more rarely tertiary gain, are terms used in medicine and psychology to describe the significant subconscious psychological motivators patients may have when presenting with symptoms. If these motivators are recognized by the patient, and especially if symptoms are fabricated or exaggerated for personal gain, then this is instead considered malingering. The difference between primary and secondary gain is that with primary gain, the reason a person may not be able to go to work is because they are injured or ill, whereas with secondary gain, the reason that person is injured or ill is so that they cannot go to work.

==Primary gain==
Primary gain produces positive internal motivations. For example, a patient might feel guilty about being unable to perform some task. If a medical condition justifying an inability is present, it may lead to decreased psychological stress. Primary gain can be a component of any disease, but is most typically demonstrated in conversion disorder — a psychiatric disorder in which stressors manifest themselves as physical symptoms without organic causes, such as a person who becomes blind after seeing a murder. The &quot;gain&quot; may not be particularly evident to an outside observer.

==Secondary gain==
Secondary gain can also be a component of any disease, but is an external motivator. If a patient&#x27;s disease allows them to miss work, avoid military duty, obtain financial compensation, obtain drugs, avoid a jail sentence, etc., these would be examples of a secondary gain. For instance, an individual having household chores completed by someone else because they have stomach cramps would be a secondary gain. In the context of a person with a significant psychiatric disability, this effect is sometimes called &quot;secondary handicap&quot;.

==Tertiary gain==
Tertiary gain, a less well-studied process, is the benefit that a third-party receives from the patient&#x27;s symptoms. It includes gaslighting wherein a person, such as a family member or healthcare worker for financial or other reasons, manipulates a patient into believing that they are ill. Tertiary gain can also be received when, for example, a pharmaceutical company runs advertisements to convince viewers they have symptoms which require treatment with the company&#x27;s drug.

<doc id="307413" wikidata="Q312517" url="?curid=307413" title="Condor (airline)">
<text>Condor, legally incorporated as Condor Flugdienst [[GmbH]], is a German airline based in Neu Isenburg, Hesse. It was established in 1955 with Frankfurt Airport as its main base. Condor offers scheduled and charter flights and operates, from Germany, medium-haul flights to the Mediterranean Basin and the Canary Islands as well as long-haul flights to destinations in Africa, Asia, North America, South America and the Caribbean. Whereas medium-haul flights are operated from many German airports and Zurich, long-haul flights usually depart from Frankfurt, with a few charter services operated from Düsseldorf and Munich.

The airline was originally established as Deutsche Flugdienst [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]] on 21 December 1955. Its initial fleet consisted of three 36-passenger Vickers VC.1 Viking aircraft, the airline&#x27;s first tourist-oriented flight commenced on 29 March 1956. In 1961, Deutsche Flugdienst took over its rival Condor-Luftreederei and subsequently adopted Condor Flugdienst GmbH as its operating name. During 1966, Condor launched its first long-haul flights. By this time, the airline had a majority market share of Germany&#x27;s tourism air travel market. During the 1990s, Condor was restructured and merged with other businesses to become an integrated tourism concern known as C&amp;N Touristik.

In 2000, the Condor shares held by Lufthansa were acquired by both Thomas Cook AG and Thomas Cook Group. On 4 February 2013, Thomas Cook Group announced that Thomas Cook Airlines, Thomas Cook Airlines Belgium, and Condor would be merged into a single operating segment of the Thomas Cook Group, Thomas Cook Group Airlines.

On 23 September 2019, Condor&#x27;s parent company Thomas Cook Group filed bankruptcy; however, Condor received a bridge loan from the German government to remain in operation, as a subsidiary of Thomas Cook. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a planned acquisition of the airline by Polish Aviation Group, owner of LOT Polish Airlines, fell through. In May 2021, a majority stake in the airline was acquired by Attestor, a British investment firm.

==History==



===1955–1979: Establishment and early years===
Condor was founded on 21 December 1955 as &quot;Deutsche Flugdienst GmbH&quot;. Its initial ownership was divided between the German shipping company Norddeutscher Lloyd (27.75%), trans-Atlantic shipping firm Hamburg America Line (27.75%), German flag carrier airline Deutsche Lufthansa (26%), and railway company Deutsche Bundesbahn (18.5%). Deutsche Flugdienst&#x27;s initial fleet consisted of three 36-passenger Vickers VC.1 Viking aircraft; they were based at Frankfurt Airport, which was also a prominent Lufthansa hub at that time. On 29 March 1956, the airline&#x27;s first tourist-oriented flight commenced, a pilgrimage flight to the Holy Land. Within its first year of operation, destinations such as Majorca and the Canary Islands were added to the airline&#x27;s flight schedule.

Between 1959 and 1960, Lufthansa bought out the other shareholdings, acquiring sole ownership of Deutsche Flugdienst. In 1961, Deutsche Flugdienst took over its rival Condor-Luftreederei (which had been founded in 1957 by Oetker), subsequently changing its name to &quot;Condor Flugdienst GmbH&quot;, thus introducing the &quot;Condor&quot; name with Lufthansa. During the following year, Condor Flugdienst GmbH had a 63.3% market share of Germany&#x27;s tourism air travel market, transporting a total of 66,000 passengers in that year; Majorca was by far the most popular destination, attracting 36,000 tourists.

The following decade was an era of considerable growth for Condor. During 1966, the company launched its first long-haul flights, reaching destinations such as Thailand, Sri Lanka, Kenya and the Dominican Republic. In 1971, Condor became the first leisure-oriented airline in the world to adopt the Boeing 747, which was the worlds’ biggest aircraft during the era. By 1973, Condor&#x27;s fleet consisted of a total of 14 Boeing airliners: Two Boeing 747s, two Boeing 707s and ten Boeing 727s.

===1980–1999: Expansion and restructuring===
During 1989, the firm launched &quot;Condor Flüge Individuell&quot; (later known as &quot;Condor Individuell&quot;); this venture leveraged its individual seat business to sell airline seats to members of the public directly. According to a Condor spokesman, the airline was selling around 15% of its tickets itself. During the early 1990s, production company Südflug, a wholly owned subsidiary of Condor, was integrated into the airline. This change brought both the Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 jetliners into Condor&#x27;s service; being configured with two-class cabins, Condor became the first tourism airline to introduce a separate, more comfortable class upon its aircraft.

During 1995, Condor expanded its shareholdings in other ventures. &quot;Condor-Touristik-Verbund&quot; held a 30% stake in &quot;alpha Holding GmbH&quot;, 37.5% of the shares in &quot;Kreutzer Touristik GmbH&quot;, wholly owned &quot;Fischer Reisen GmbH&quot;, and a 10% stake in &quot;Öger Tours GmbH&quot;. The airline also assumed ownership of the 40% stake held by parent airline Lufthansa in SunExpress, a Turkish charter airline; its ownership of the firm would subsequently be extended to 50%.

1996 was &quot;Condor Flugdienst GmbH&quot;&#x27;s 40th anniversary; to mark the occasion, American artist James Rizzi redecorated a Boeing 757 as a flying work of art, which was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Rizzi-Bird&quot;. In the latter half of that year, the company became the launch customer for the Boeing 757-300, having placed twelve firm orders for the variant. To increase operational flexibility, Condor frequently trained its pilots so that they could operate both the Boeing 757 and 767 without any restrictions.

During 1998, the airline established &quot;Condor Berlin GmbH&quot;, a wholly owned subsidiary headquartered at Berlin Schönefeld Airport. This new entity was a low-cost carrier intended to compete with rivals such as Aero Lloyd and Air Berlin; Condor estimated that its subsidiary&#x27;s costs ought to be about 20% lower than the parent company&#x27;s own. That same year, Condor placed orders for six Airbus A320-200 airliners, the most technologically modern short-haul aircraft in the world at that time; that airline would subsequently operate twelve aircraft of the type in its fleet.

The late 1990s was dominated by industrial consolidation efforts. Condor&#x27;s parent airline, Lufthansa, opted to break ties with Hapag-Lloyd to link up with German retailer Karstadt and &quot;NUR&quot;, its tour operator; this led to the creation of the jointly owned &quot;C&amp;N Touristik&quot;, bringing together Germany&#x27;s largest holiday airline with tour operations. Thus, Condor became an integrated tourism concern.

===2000–2009: Transition to Thomas Cook ownership===
From 2000 onwards, the Condor shares held by Lufthansa were gradually acquired by both Thomas Cook AG and Thomas Cook Group. The process of transforming Condor from a Lufthansa subsidiary to a part of Thomas Cook (along with Thomas Cook Airlines, Thomas Cook Airlines Belgium and Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia began with the rebranding as Thomas Cook powered by Condor on 1 March 2003. A new livery was introduced, featuring the Thomas Cook logo on the aircraft tail and the word &quot;Condor&quot; written in the font used by Thomas Cook Airlines. On 23 January 2004, Condor became part of Thomas Cook AG and returned to the &quot;Condor&quot; brand name. By December 2006, the remaining Lufthansa shares only amounted to 24.9 percent.

On 20 September 2007, shortly after having taken over LTU International, Air Berlin announced its intention to acquire Condor in a share swap deal. It was intended to buy the 75.1 percent of Condor shares held by Thomas Cook, with the remaining Lufthansa assets being acquired in 2010. In return, Thomas Cook would take up 29.99 percent of the Air Berlin stock. However, on 11 September 2008, this plan was abandoned.

===2010–2020: Rise and fall of Thomas Cook Group Airlines===
In December 2010, Thomas Cook Group chose the Airbus A320 family as preferred short-medium haul aircraft type for its airlines, with a review concerning the long-haul aircraft scheduled for 2011.

On 17 September 2012, the airline signed a codeshare agreement with the Mexican low-cost carrier, Volaris.
On 12 March 2013, Condor and the Canadian airline WestJet agreed on an interline partnership which will offer customers connecting flights to/from 17 destinations in Canada. This agreement expands the network of both airlines, allowing passengers to connect beyond each airline&#x27;s own network.

On 4 February 2013, the Thomas Cook Group announced that Thomas Cook Airlines, Thomas Cook Airlines Belgium, and Condor would merge into a single operating segment of the Thomas Cook Group, Thomas Cook Group Airlines. On 1 October 2013, the Thomas Cook Group began presenting itself under the new unified brand symbol. The aircraft of the Thomas Cook Group Airlines also had the new logo: the Sunny Heart added to their tails and were re-painted in the new corporate color scheme grey, white, and yellow. On the aircraft, the Sunny Heart on the tail is meant to symbolize the unification of airline brands and tour operators within the entire Thomas Cook Group.

Condor refurbished the cabins on all of its Boeing 767-300 long-haul aircraft. All economy class and premium economy class seats were replaced with new seats from ZIM Flugsitz GmbH. Condor kept its successful Premium Economy Class with more legroom and added services. The new Business Class seats (Zodiac Aerospace) offer fully automated, angled-lie-flat seats capable of inclining to an angle of 170 degrees with a bed length of . The airline added seats in its new Business Class section from 18 to 30 seats on three of its Boeing 767 aircraft. New in-flight entertainment includes personal screens for all passengers throughout all three classes of service. Condor will implement the RAVE IFE technology of Zodiac In-flight Entertainment. On 27 June 2014, Condor completed the cabin refurbishment for all of its long-haul Boeing 767 aircraft.

In early 2017, Condor&#x27;s CEO Ralf Teckentrup introduced a plan to cut operating costs by €40 million, because of the €14 million operating cost loss and the €1.4 billion revenue drop. The passenger numbers also dropped by 6%. Condor had also planned new routes to the United States for San Diego, New Orleans, and Pittsburgh; all flights are operated by the 767-300ER.

On 25 September 2019, Condor secured additional credit facilities of €380 million to keep flying, despite the collapse of Thomas Cook Group. On the same day, a Frankfurt court authorised investor protection measures to allow Condor to be restructured. On 1 December 2019, the Frankfurt district formally opened these proceedings under the &quot;Schutzschirmverfahren&quot; (protective shield proceedings) clause with the liquidator, , requesting creditors to register their claims with him by 8 January 2020.

On 24 January 2020, Condor announced that PGL Polish Aviation Group would be buying Condor and the deal was expected to close in April 2020 once antitrust approvals are obtained. With this deal, PGL was expected to repay the bridge loan from Germany in full. Condor would have continued to operate under their current brand and management. However, on 2 April 2020 it was announced that the sale to LOT Polish Airlines had fallen through.

===2021-present===
On 20 May 2021, Attestor Capital acquired 51% of the airline and announced that it would provide €200 million of equity capital and a further €250 million to modernise Condor&#x27;s long-haul fleet. In July 2021, the European Commission approved a €525.3 million aid package offered by the German government. On 28 July 2021, the airline announced an order of 16 Airbus A330-900 to replace its current fleet of Boeing 767-300ER. The order was later expanded to 18 aircraft, and then again to 21 aircraft.

In April 2022, Condor announced a major change to its corporate design including a revised logo and an entirely new aircraft livery composed of distinctive stripes in bold colors over the entire fuselage, replacing the former Thomas Cook design. On 25 July 2022, the airline announced an order of 13 Airbus A320neo and 28 Airbus A321neo to replace its existing fleet of Airbus A320 family and Boeing 757-300. On 19 December 2022, Condor received its first of overall 21 Airbus A330-900 in Frankfurt to renew its entire long-haul fleet. The aircraft&#x27;s first revenue flight took off on 27 December to Mauritius. The second aircraft followed only a few days later on 30 December 2022.

In December 2024, Condor announced it would terminate all flights to destinations in Cuba (to Havana, Varadero and Holguin) in 2025, citing receding demand while issues with the local infrastructure had increased in recent years. Shortly after, Condor also announced it would terminate flights to six of its North American destinations (San Antonio, Phoenix, Baltimore, Minneapolis, Halifax and Edmonton).

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 17 October 1958, a Deutsche Flugdienst (as the airline was called at that time) Vickers VC.1 Viking (registered D-BELA) on a cargo flight had to carry out a forced landing near Zele in Belgium due to an engine fire. Upon impact, the aircraft caught fire and was destroyed, but all three crew members on board survived.
* On 31 July 1960, a Deutsche Flugdienst Convair CV-240 (registered D-BELU) en route from Frankfurt to Rimini experienced failures in both engines upon approaching Rimini Airport. The pilots had to carry out an emergency landing short of the runway, which resulted in the death of one passenger (out of thirty, with additional four crew members on board) and the aircraft being written off.
* On 20 July 1970, a Condor Boeing 737-100 (registered D-ABEL) which was approaching Reus Airport, collided with a privately owned Piper Cherokee light aircraft (registration EC-BRU) near Tarragona, Spain. The Piper subsequently crashed, resulting in the death of the three persons on board. The Condor Boeing suffered only minor damage, and there were no injuries among the 95 passengers and 5 crew members.
* On 2 January 1988 at 19:18 local time, Condor Flugdienst Flight 3782, a Boeing 737-200 (registered D-ABHD) on a chartered service from Stuttgart to İzmir, crashed into a hill near Seferihisar whilst approaching Adnan Menderes Airport, killing all 11 passengers and 5 crew members on board. Wrong use of navigation aids and lack of adherence to company procedures especially in respect of crew coordination were given as causes for the accident.
* On 24 June 1992, a Condor Boeing 767-300 (registered D-ABUZ) took a wrong turn after departing Porlamar Airport in Venezuela on a charter flight back to Germany, resulting in an overflight of mountainous terrain at a low altitude. The aircraft hit a TV mast on top of El Copey (with , the second highest peak on Isla Margarita) with its left wing. The wing was substantially damaged (but could later be repaired), and the pilots managed to return to Porlamar Airport, without any of the 251 passengers and 12 crew members on board being injured.
* On 2 December 2015, a Condor Airbus A321-200, registration D-AIAF, was being towed at Berlin&#x27;s Schönefeld Airport when the left wing struck a light tower. The tower collapsed and fell on the aircraft tearing open a section of fuselage of the cockpit injuring a technician in the cockpit. The aircraft was repaired and put back into service.

<text>Cognitive ontology is ontology (study of being) which begins from features of human cognition directly, as opposed to its collective summary which is reflected in language. The more radical forms of it challenge also the central position of mathematics as &quot;just another language&quot; which biases human cognition. Perceptual psychology is a very closely related field, as it studies the limits of what humans &quot;can&quot; perceive. Barry Smith is perhaps the principal developer of this field, and has also developed the related topic of naïve physics.

<text>Josef Erich Zawinul ( &quot;&quot;; 7 July 1932 – 11 September 2007) was an Austrian jazz and jazz fusion keyboardist and composer. First coming to prominence with saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, Zawinul went on to play with Miles Davis and to become one of the creators of jazz fusion, a musical genre that combined jazz with rock. He co-founded the groups Weather Report and The Zawinul Syndicate. He pioneered the use of electric piano and synthesizer, and was named &quot;Best Electric Keyboardist&quot; twenty-eight times by the readers of &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Zawinul grew up in Vienna, Austria. Accordion was his first instrument. When he was six or seven, he studied clarinet, violin, and piano at the Vienna Conservatory (Konservatorium Wien). During the 1950s he was a staff pianist for Polydor. He worked as a jazz musician with Hans Koller, Friedrich Gulda, Karl Drewo, and Fatty George. In 1959 he moved to the U.S. to attend Berklee College of Music, but a week later he received a job offer from Maynard Ferguson, so he left school and went on tour. He then accompanied Dinah Washington. He spent most of the 1960s with Cannonball Adderley. During this time, he wrote &quot;Mercy, Mercy, Mercy&quot;, &quot;Walk Tall&quot; and &quot;Country Preacher&quot;, and played electric piano. As recounted in Zawinul&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, &quot;It was uncommon then for a black bandleader like Adderley to hire a white sideman like Mr. Zawinul and touring could be problematic. &#x27;I often had to sit in the bottom of the car when we drove through certain parts of the South,&#x27; Mr. Zawinul said in a 1997 interview with Anil Prasad of &quot;Innerviews&quot; magazine. But, he added, with characteristic bravado, &#x27;Those kinds of things never fazed me; I wanted to play music with the best, and I could play on that level with the best.&#x27;&quot;

At the end of the decade, Zawinul recorded with Miles Davis on &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; and &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, as Davis established the genre of jazz fusion by combining jazz with rock.

===With Weather Report===
In 1970, Zawinul founded Weather Report with Wayne Shorter. Their first two years emphasized a relatively open, group improvisation format similar to what Miles Davis was doing in a more rock oriented format. However, Zawinul started making changes with their third album, &quot;Sweetnighter&quot;. Funk elements such as bass guitar and wah-wah pedal began to be introduced to the band&#x27;s sound. With the fourth album, &quot;Mysterious Traveller&quot;, the musical forms were composed similar to classical music, and the combination of jazz harmonies with 1970s groove helped move the band into its most commercially successful period.

The band&#x27;s biggest commercial success came from Zawinul&#x27;s composition &quot;Birdland&quot; on the 1977 album &quot;Heavy Weather&quot;, which peaked at number 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop albums chart. &quot;Birdland&quot; is one of the most recognizable jazz pieces of the 1970s, recorded by The Manhattan Transfer, Quincy Jones, Maynard Ferguson, and Buddy Rich among others. The song won him three Grammys.

Weather Report was active until the mid-1980s, with Zawinul and Shorter remaining the sole constant members through multiple personnel shifts. Shorter and Zawinul went separate ways after recording &quot;Sportin&#x27; Life&quot;, but it was discovered they had to do one more album to fulfill their contract with CBS Records. &quot;This Is This!&quot; therefore became the band&#x27;s final album.

In 1991, Zawinul was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music and on this occasion performed with a group consisting of Matthew Garrison, Torsten de Winkel, Abe Laboriel Jr. and Melvin Butler.

=== With The Zawinul Syndicate ===

The Zawinul Syndicate was a jazz fusion band formed in 1988. It evolved out of Weather Report.
Their style could be described as a combination of unusual grooves, driving and swinging rhythms and many borrowings from different music cultures.

Zawinul himself stated that he gave the band its name due to a syndicate bearing more resemblance to a family than &quot;just&quot; a band.

After the death of Zawinul in 2007, several members of the Zawinul Syndicate decided to reform and perform Zawinul&#x27;s music live under their shortened name the Syndicate.

Several major members of the Syndicate over the years include Scott Henderson, Bobby Thomas Jr, Linley Marthe, Paco Sery, Manolo Badrena, Nathaniel Townsley, Sabine Kabongo, Gary Poulson, Richard Bona, and Victor Bailey.

=== Stories of the Danube ===

Zawinul also wrote a symphony, called &quot;Stories of the Danube&quot;, which was commissioned by the Brucknerhaus, Linz. It was first performed as part of the &quot;Linzer Klangwolke&quot; (a large-scale open-air broadcast event), for the opening of the 1993 Bruckner Festival in Linz. In its seven movements, the symphony traces the course of the Danube from Donaueschingen through various countries ending at the Black Sea. It was recorded in 1995 by the Czech State Philharmonic Orchestra, Brno, conducted by Caspar Richter.
=== Death ===
Zawinul became ill and was hospitalized in his native Vienna on 7 August 2007, after concluding a five-week European tour. He died a little over a month later from a rare form of skin cancer (Merkel cell carcinoma) on 11 September 2007. He was cremated at Feuerhalle Simmering and his ashes buried in Vienna Central Cemetery. His wife Maxine had died earlier the same year. They were survived by their sons Erich, Ivan, and Anthony.

<doc id="307431" wikidata="Q3282433" url="?curid=307431" title="The Road Ahead (Gates book)">
<text>The Road Ahead is a book written by Bill Gates, co-founder and former CEO of Microsoft; Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft executive; and former Microsoft vice president Peter Rinearson. Published in November 1995, then substantially revised about a year later, &quot;The Road Ahead&quot; summarized the implications of the personal computing revolution and described a future profoundly changed by the arrival of a global information superhighway.

Gates received a $2.5-million advance for his book and money from subsidiary rights sales; all his proceeds were donated to &quot;encourage the use of technology in education administered through the National Foundation for the Improvement of Education,&quot; a foundation created by the National Education Association.

==Content differences between hardback and trade editions==
The hardback edition saw the Internet as one of the &quot;important precursors of the information highway...suggestive of [its] future&quot; (p. 89); he noted that the &quot;popularity of the Internet is the most important single development in the world of computing since the IBM PC was introduced in 1981&quot; (p. 91) but &quot;today&#x27;s Internet is not the information highway I imagine, although you can think of it as the beginning of the highway&quot;: the information highway he envisioned would be as different from the Internet as the Oregon Trail was to Interstate 84. (p. 95)

The revised edition was published in October 1996 as a trade paperback, with the subtitle &quot;Completely revised and up-to-date.&quot;.

Both editions came with a CD-ROM that contained the text of the book and supplemental information. The hardback was published by Viking, and the paperback by Penguin, an affiliate of Viking. Numerous publishers around the world produced translated versions of the book.

==Collaborators==
One of Gates&#x27; coauthors, Nathan Myhrvold, was a computer scientist and Microsoft vice president who for a time oversaw Microsoft&#x27;s research efforts and later co-founded Intellectual Ventures, an intellectual property company. The other co-author, Peter Rinearson, was a Pulitzer Prize winner and entrepreneur who later founded and sold an Internet company and became a Microsoft vice president.

==Quotes==
* &quot;Anyone expecting an autobiography or a treatise on what it&#x27;s like to have been as lucky as I have been will be disappointed.&quot; (p. xiii)
* &quot;Computers are great because when you&#x27;re working with them you get immediate results that let you know if your program works. It&#x27;s feedback you don&#x27;t get from many other things.&quot; (p. 2)
* &quot;Corporations will redesign their nervous systems to rely on the networks that reach every member of the organization and beyond into the world of suppliers, consultants and customers.&quot; (1996: 153)
* &quot;We&#x27;ll find ourselves in a new world of friction, overhead capitalism, in which market information will be plentiful and transaction costs low. It will be a shopper&#x27;s heaven&quot; (1996: 181).
* &quot;The obvious mathematical breakthrough would be development of an easy way to factor large prime numbers.&quot; (p. 265)

==Publicity==

The publisher&#x27;s $1 million promotional budget was one of its largest ever, rivaling that given to &quot;My American Journey&quot;, an autobiography of Gen. Colin Powell also released at the time. The first excerpts from the book were published on November 19 by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in the United Kingdom (only a few months after Microsoft, in a Windows 95 promotion, &quot;paid for an entire daily press run of &quot;The Times&quot; and gave it away to readers&quot;) and in the November 27th, edition of &quot;Newsweek&quot;. Accompanying the publicity was a &quot;one-day lay down&quot;, a &quot;very expensive marketing technique&quot; where a book is placed on sale in multiple countries on the same day (November 24, in this case), giving the book &quot;an almost sure shot at the No. 1 spot on best-seller lists.&quot; &quot;The Road Ahead&quot; got a first printing of 850,000 books in North America and several hundred thousand overseas.

It was early enough in the history of the World Wide Web that &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought it newsworthy to report that Gates was going to &quot;conduct on-line forums to promote the book&quot; and Penguin had created a &quot;Bill Gates web site on the Internet (http://www.penguin.com/roadahead), which will feature information and an audio clip about the book, printed excerpts and quotes from reviews, as well as information about the CD-ROM.&quot;

Gates publicized the book&#x27;s release during a five-day tour of Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington, London and Paris, which included appearances on &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;Talking with David Frost&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot;, the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, MTV, &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, and &quot;The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;The Road Ahead&quot; occupied the top spot on &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; bestseller list for over seven weeks in late 1995 and early 1996, and sold 2.5 million copies.

A reviewer at &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; (and coauthor of &quot;Gates: How Microsoft&#x27;s Mogul Reinvented an Industry and Made Himself the Richest Man in America&quot;, a 1993 biography of Gates), called Gates&#x27; coverage of the Internet &quot;weakest of all&quot; the topics Gates covered, saying the &quot;World Wide Web receives just four index citations and is treated as a functional appendage of the Internet (rather than its driving force), and both come off as a subset of the Information Highway, a term Gates uses with abandon.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; review called the book &quot;bland and tepid&quot; and reading &quot;as if it had been vetted by a committee of Microsoft executives&quot;; it is &quot;little more than a positioning document, sold in book form with accompanying CD-ROM and designed mainly to advance the interests of the Microsoft Corporation.&quot; It also said that Gates &quot;has been caught flat-footed by [the Internet&#x27;s] sudden emergence&quot; and saying the book is &quot;part of Mr. Gates&#x27;s extensive effort to force his way back into the game before it&#x27;s too late.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine, in a December 1995 article about Gates in general rather than his book, said:
Gates is as fearful as he is feared, and these days he worries most about the Internet, Usenet and the World Wide Web, which threaten his software monopoly by shifting the nexus of control from stand-alone computers to the network that connects them. The Internet, by design, has no central operating system that Microsoft or anybody else can patent and license. And its libertarian culture is devoted to open—that is to say, nonproprietary—standards, none of which were set by Microsoft. Gates moved quickly this year to embrace the Net, although it sometimes seemed he was trying to wrap Microsoft&#x27;s long arms around it.

The club has played at Alyn Park since they were founded in 1929.

==History==
Mold Alexandra was formed in 1929. Several teams had previously been established in the town including Mold Town which folded a year after Alexandra was founded. Alexandra joined the Mold, Deeside and Buckley League for the 1930–31 season, playing its first competitive fixture on 30 August 1930, defeating Oakenholt St David&#x27;s 5–3. The club went on to win the North Wales Junior Cup in its first season and the Flintshire Amateur League in its second.

Alexandra joined the West Cheshire Association Football League in 1937 before joining the Welsh National League Wrexham Area after the Second World War. The club remained in the division for more than 40 years. The 1980s proved to be a successful decade for the club as it won the Welsh National League on two occasions and won several regional cup competitions. As a result, Alexandra were invited to join the newly formed Cymru Alliance in 1990. In its two seasons in the league, Alexandra finished outside the top 10 on both occasions.

In 1992, the League of Wales was formed as the top tier of senior football in Wales. Alexandra was one of the 20 founding members of the league and played its first match against Inter Cardiff, losing 1–0. Alexandra was temporarily suspended from the league after failing to meet ground regulation requirements but the club was able to rectify the problems and were reinstated, finishing the season in 13th position. The club suffered financial difficulties in its following two seasons and were relegated from the League of Wales on the final day of the 1994–95 season after losing 7–3 to Ton Pentre.

The club returned to the Cymru Alliance for three seasons, but were relegated again in 1998. The club chose to drop to Division One of the Wrexham Area League, taking the place of the club&#x27;s reserve side. Alexandra won promotion to the Premier Division of the regional league in its first season and returned to the Cymru Alliance in 2002. The club spent the following 15 years moving between the Cymru Alliance and the Premier Division of the Wrexham Area League.

<doc id="307442" wikidata="Q585149" url="?curid=307442" title="Marylebone Cricket Club">
<text>Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) is a cricket club founded in 1787 and based since 1814 at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground, which it owns, in St John&#x27;s Wood, London, England. The club, formerly the governing body of cricket, retains considerable global influence.

In 1788, the MCC took responsibility for the laws of cricket, issuing a revised version that year. Changes to these Laws are now determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC), but the copyright is still owned by MCC. When the ICC was established in 1909, it was administered by the secretary of the MCC, and the president of MCC automatically assumed the chairmanship of ICC until 1989.

For much of the 20th century, commencing with the 1903–04 tour of Australia and ending with the 1976–77 tour of India, MCC organised international tours on behalf of the England cricket team for playing Test matches. On these tours, the England team played under the auspices of MCC in non-international matches. In 1993, its administrative and governance functions were transferred to the ICC and the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB).

MCC teams are essentially &quot;ad hoc&quot; because they have never taken part in any formal competition but have always held first-class status when playing against first-class opposition.

The current president of the club is Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury, former governor of the Bank of England, who succeeded Mark Nicholas on 1 October 2024.

== History and role ==

The origin of MCC was as a gentlemen&#x27;s club that had flourished through most of the 18th century, including, at least in part, an existence as the original London Cricket Club, which had played at the Artillery Ground through the middle years of the century. Many of its members became involved with the Hambledon Club through the 1770s and then, in the early 1780s, had returned to the London area where the White Conduit Club had begun in Islington. It is not known for certain when the White Conduit was founded but it seems to have been after 1780 and certainly by 1785. According to Sir Pelham Warner, it was formed in 1782 as an offshoot from a West End convivial club called the &quot;Je-ne-sais-quoi&quot;, some of whose members frequented the White Conduit House in Islington and played matches on the neighbouring White Conduit Fields, which had been a prominent venue for cricket in the 1720s. Arthur Haygarth said in &quot;Scores and Biographies&quot; that &quot;the Marylebone Club was founded in 1787 from the White Conduit&#x27;s members&quot; but the date of the formation of the White Conduit &quot;could not be found&quot;.

This gentlemen&#x27;s club, which was multi-purpose, had a social meeting place at the &quot;Star and Garter&quot; on Pall Mall. It was the same club that was responsible for drafting the Laws of Cricket at various times, most notably in 1744 and 1774, and this lawgiving responsibility was soon to be vested in the MCC as the final repose of these cricketing gentlemen. When the White Conduit began, its leading lights were George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea (1752–1826) and the Hon. Colonel Charles Lennox (1764–1819), later succeeding as the 4th Duke of Richmond. White Conduit was nominally an exclusive club that only &quot;gentlemen&quot; might play for, but the club did engage professionals and one of these was Thomas Lord, a man who was recognised for his business acumen (becoming a successful wine merchant) &quot;as well as his bowling ability&quot;.

The new club might have continued except that White Conduit Fields was an open area allowing members of the public, including the rowdier elements, to watch the matches and to voice their opinions on the play and the players. The White Conduit gentlemen were not amused by such interruptions and decided to look for a more private venue of their own. Winchilsea and Lennox asked Lord to find a new ground and offered him a guarantee against any losses he may suffer in the venture. Lord took a lease from the Portman Estate on some land at Dorset Fields where Dorset Square is now sited; and the ground was prepared and opened in 1787. It was initially called the New Cricket Ground, perhaps because it was off what was then called &quot;the New Road&quot; in Marylebone, when the first known match was played there on 21 May but, by the end of July, it was known as &quot;Lord&#x27;s&quot;. As it was in Marylebone, the White Conduit members who relocated to it soon decided to call themselves the &quot;Mary-le-bone Club&quot;. The exact date of MCC&#x27;s foundation is lost but seems to have been sometime in the late spring or the summer of 1787. On 10 &amp; 11 July 1837, a South v North match was staged at Lord&#x27;s to commemorate the MCC&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. Warner described it as &quot;a Grand Match to celebrate the Jubilee of the Club&quot; and reproduced the full scorecard.

On 25 April 1787, the London &quot;Morning Herald&quot; newspaper carried a notice: &quot;The Members of the Cricket Club are desired to meet at the &quot;Star and Garter&quot;, Pall Mall, on Mon., April 30. Dinner on table exactly at half past five o&#x27;clock. N.B. The favour of an answer is desired&quot;. The agenda is unknown but, only three weeks later on Saturday, 19 May, the &quot;Morning Herald&quot; advertised: &quot;A grand match will be played on Monday, 21 May in the New Cricket Ground, the New Road, Mary-le-bone, between eleven Noblemen of the White Conduit Club and eleven Gentlemen of the County of Middlesex with two men given, for 500 guineas a side. The wickets to be pitched at ten o&#x27;clock, and the match to be played out&quot;. No post-match report has been found but, as G. B. Buckley said, it was &quot;apparently the first match to be played on Lord&#x27;s new ground&quot;.

A total of eight matches are known to have been played at Lord&#x27;s in 1787, one of them a single wicket event. The only one which featured the Mary-le-bone Club took place on Monday, 30 July. It was advertised in &quot;The World&quot; on Friday, 27 July 1787: &quot;On Monday, 30 July will be played (at Lord&#x27;s) a match between 11 gentlemen of the Mary-le-bone Club and 11 gentlemen of the Islington Club&quot;. Buckley stated that &quot;this is the earliest notice of the Marylebone Club&quot;. As with the inaugural match at Lord&#x27;s, no post-match report of the inaugural MCC match has been found.

==Grounds==

There have been three Lord&#x27;s grounds: the original on the Portman Estate and two on the Eyre Estate. All three sites lie to the west of Regent&#x27;s Park. Thomas Lord leased the original ground, now referred to as Lord&#x27;s Old Ground, from the Portman Estate in 1787 and MCC played there until 1810 when Lord, after objecting to a rent increase, decided on termination of the lease to lift his turf and move out. Over 200 matches are known to have been played there, mostly involving MCC and/or Middlesex. The Old Ground was on the site now occupied by Dorset Square which is east of Marylebone Station and west of Baker Street. To commemorate the association, a plaque was unveiled in Dorset Square on 9 May 2006 by Sir Andrew Strauss.

Lord had been aware some years before 1810 that the Portman Estate intended to let the site on building leases which would command the much higher rent of over £600 per annum. On 15 October 1808, he rented two fields in the North Bank area of the St John&#x27;s Wood Estate, which belonged to Richard Eyre, a local landowner after whom Eyre&#x27;s Tunnel on the Regent&#x27;s Canal was named. Rental on the Eyre site was only £54 per annum for a term of eighty years and free of both land tax and tithe.

The new ground was ready for use in 1809 and so Lord had two grounds at his disposal for the 1809 and 1810 seasons. The North Bank ground was sub-let to St John&#x27;s Wood Cricket Club which eventually merged with MCC. Lord officially took over his second ground on 8 May 1811 by re-laying there his turf from the Old Ground. He did this so that &quot;the noblemen and gentlemen of the MCC should be able to play on the same footing as before&quot;. According to Warner, however, the relocation was unpopular with many MCC members and, as a result, the club played no matches there in either 1811 or 1812. This may have been so, but cricket generally was in decline at the time because of the Napoleonic Wars. The Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (the ACS) holds that &quot;(from) 1810 to 1814 the game was all but dead&quot;, largely because of the war and &quot;the very real threat of civil unrest in England&quot;. The second venue is now generally known as Lord&#x27;s Middle Ground. In the three years that Lord controlled it, only six matches are known to have taken place there and just three of these (all in 1813) involved MCC. The Middle Ground&#x27;s exact location is uncertain but it is understood to have been in North Bank at the north end of Lisson Grove and that the Regent&#x27;s Canal has been cut through it. This means that it was partially on the canal route and somewhere in the area now bounded by Lisson Grove (the B507) to south-west, Lodge Road to north-west, Park Road (the A41) to north-east and the Regent&#x27;s Canal to south-east. It was less than from the site of the modern Lord&#x27;s ground.

Lord was forced to abandon the Middle Ground because of the canal construction. The decision on the route was made by Parliament in 1813. Lord, via his protégé Lord Frederick Beauclerk, approached the Eyre family who agreed to lease him another plot nearby in St John&#x27;s Wood, but at an increased rent of £100 per annum. Lord accepted and again removed and relaid his turf in time for the start of the 1814 season. This third ground was the present Lord&#x27;s, now home to MCC for over 200 years.

===Other grounds===
From 1996 to 2008, the MCC played nine first class matches and three list A matches against touring sides at grounds other than Lords:

* Denis Compton Oval, Shenley, Hertfordshire: (1996–1999)

** 2002 vs Sri Lanka (first class)
* The Racecourse, Durham: (2007–2008)

** 2008 vs Bangladesh A (list A)

==&quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;==

MCC is the body responsible for, and remains the copyright holder of, the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;. Its Laws Sub-Committee is responsible for debating and drafting changes to the Laws, with the Main Committee then voting on any changes proposed.

==Membership==

MCC has 18,000 full members and 5,000 associate members. Members have voting rights and can use the Pavilion and other stands at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground to attend all matches played there.

The club&#x27;s members did not allow female membership up until 1998, with club ballots on the change not achieving the two-thirds majority amongst the membership required for implementation. The move to change was spearheaded by Rachael Heyhoe Flint who applied as &quot;R Flint&quot; to slip into the male-only application system. When Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie, a longstanding supporter of women&#x27;s membership, took on the presidency of MCC in 1996 he led a two-year campaign to convince the membership to vote in favour of change. In September 1998 a 70% majority of members voted to allow female membership, so ending 212 years of male exclusivity, and 10 honorary life members were immediately admitted, including Heyhoe Flint. Until this time, The Queen, the club&#x27;s patron, was the only woman (other than domestic staff) permitted to enter the Pavilion during play. In February 1999, five women were invited to join as playing members.

In order to join the waiting list of candidates for membership one must obtain the vote (of which each full member has one a year) of three members, and the additional sponsorship of a person on the List of MCC Sponsors (which consists of members of all MCC Sub-Committees; MCC Committee; MCC Out-Match Representatives; and the Current, Past and Designate President). As the demand for membership always outstrips supply each year, there continues to be a substantial waiting list for Full Ordinary Membership, currently around 27 years. There are, however, ways to lessen the time it takes to become a full member: one may qualify as a Playing Member, or Out-Match Member (although this carries none of the privileges of membership, apart from being able to play for the club).

In addition, membership rules allow a certain number of people each year to be elected ahead of their turn; beneficiaries have included Mick Jagger and in 2018 the Prime Minister, Theresa, &quot;now&quot; Lady May. MCC also grants limited honorary membership to people who have had distinguished cricket careers. The club recognises achievement in women&#x27;s cricket with, for example, Charlotte Edwards an inductee in the 2010s.

==Controversies==
In 2005 the club was criticised (including by a few of its own members) for siding with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) over the latter&#x27;s decision to award television rights for Test cricket to British Sky Broadcasting, thus removing Test cricket from terrestrial television. The then Secretary and Chief Executive of MCC, Roger Knight, represented the club on the board of the ECB and was party to this decision, prior to which Test cricket had been shown free to viewers on British television for more than half a century.

MCC decided to allow members and other spectators to continue to bring limited amounts of alcoholic drinks into the ground at all matches. The ICC, was attempting to implement a ban on this practice at all international matches around the world. MCC opted to write to the ICC on an annual basis to seek permission for members and spectators to import alcohol into Lord&#x27;s.

The Secretary &amp; Chief Executive of the club has a place on the administrative board of the England and Wales Cricket Board and it is reported that Keith Bradshaw (Secretary &amp; Chief Executive 2006–11) may have influenced the removal from office of England Coach Duncan Fletcher in April 2007.

In 2012, MCC made headlines over a redevelopment plan, &quot;Vision for Lord&#x27;s&quot;, that would have increased capacity but included construction of residential flats on some of the MCC site. Internal strife over the process of making a decision on the proposal led to the resignation of former Prime Minister Sir John Major from the Main Committee.

In 2022, Guy Lavender, Secretary &amp; Chief Executive of MCC, announced that the annual one-day Oxford v Cambridge and Eton v Harrow matches, both of which have been played at Lord&#x27;s since the early 19th century, would no longer be held at the ground, so as to make room in the fixture list for the finals of competitions for all universities and schools in pursuit of greater diversity. Following opposition from a majority of its membership, the club decided that the matches would continue to be held at Lord&#x27;s until at least 2023 to allow time for further consultation. In March 2023 it was announced that the fixtures would continue to be played at Lord&#x27;s until at least 2027, following which there would be a review and a possible vote in 2028 on whether the matches should remain at Lord&#x27;s.

During the second test of the 2023 Ashes series at Lord&#x27;s, the MCC apologised to Cricket Australia and suspended three members for confronting Australia national cricket team players walking through the members&#x27; area. Video emerged of MCC members shouting abuse at Australian players after Jonny Bairstow was stumped under controversial circumstances, despite the dismissal being fair and legal.

==Matches==
MCC men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams play domestic matches throughout the spring and summer against teams from universities, schools, the Armed Forces and invitational teams such as the Duchess of Rutland&#x27;s XI. The men&#x27;s team tour internationally four times per year, and the women&#x27;s team tour every other year.

==Coaching==

MCC has long had a deep involvement in coaching cricket. The club&#x27;s head coach leads an extensive operation involving the running of an indoor-cricket school and a team of coaches in England and around the world. The club has traditionally produced a coaching manual, the &quot;MCC Cricket Coaching Book&quot;, a bible for cricket skills, and runs training programmes for young cricketers, including many at its Lord&#x27;s Indoor Centre. MCC continues to tour around England, playing matches against various state and private schools. This tradition has been followed since the 19th century. The club has other sporting interests with both a real tennis and a squash court on site at Lord&#x27;s, and golf, chess, bridge and backgammon societies.

==Club colours==
From the beginning of the 20th century, MCC organised the England cricket team and, outside Test matches, the touring England team officially played as &quot;MCC&quot; up to and including the 1976/77 tour of India. The England touring team wore the distinctive red and yellow stripes of the Marylebone Cricket Club as their colours for the last time on the tour to New Zealand in 1996/97.

The true provenance of MCC&#x27;s colours is (and probably will remain) unsubstantiated, but its players often turned out sporting sky blue (&quot;qv.&quot; Eton or Cambridge) until well into the 19th century. The club eventually settled on the now well-recognised colours of scarlet and gold, or in other parlance &quot;egg and bacon&quot;. One purported theory is that MCC adopted these colours from J&amp;W Nicholson &amp; Co&#x27;s gin after the company&#x27;s chairman, MCC benefactor William Nicholson (1825–1909), secured the club&#x27;s position at Lord&#x27;s with a loan. A more likely theory, which chimes with the club&#x27;s origins, is that MCC borrowed its colours from the livery colours (racing) of a founding patron, the Duke of Richmond, Lennox and Gordon, of Goodwood-fame.

==Image==
Often viewed as too traditional, the club continues its modernising mission before the public and media, partly because it remains a citadel for tradition in a fast-changing landscape and partly because it has made a concerted move towards image-improvement. &quot;It would be overstating things to claim that the MCC has come full circle,&quot; admitted Andrew Miller at the beginning of October 2008, &quot;but at a time of massive upheaval in the world game, the... NW8&#x27;s colours cease to represent everything that is wrong with cricket, and instead have become a touchstone for those whose greatest fear is the erosion of the game&#x27;s traditional values.&quot;

==Legal status==
Before 2013 the MCC was a private members&#x27; club (meaning that it had the status of an unincorporated association); this status had several limitations. Since an unincorporated association is not a legal entity, it could not own property (such as Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground itself) in its own name. It could not sue anybody, or indeed be sued (any legal action had to be taken against the Secretary &amp; Chief Executive personally). In the event that a claim was successful, the committee and even the members themselves would have had to fund any financial shortfall. The club therefore called a Special General Meeting in June 2012 to consider petitioning The Queen in Council to incorporate the club by Royal Charter. The Royal Charter removed many of the barriers and simplified the administration of the club.

Resulting from the petition, in December 2012 the club was granted a Royal Charter, two previous attempts having been unsuccessful. As a result, the club became an incorporated association and is now able to hold assets, including the Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground, in its own name instead of via a custodian trustee. It also meant that the individual members, as the club&#x27;s owners, no longer have a potential liability should the club ever get into serious financial trouble.

==MCC Universities==
From 2005 the MCC funded six university cricket academies known as the MCC Universities (MCCUs), which had previously been funded (from 2000) by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). (Prior to 2010 they were known as the University Centres of Cricketing Excellence, or UCCEs.) These were based at Cambridge, Cardiff, Durham, Leeds/Bradford, Loughborough and Oxford, and incorporated a total of thirteen universities. From 2012 all six MCCUs held first-class status. Each MCCU played a trio of matches against professional county sides at the beginning of each season, with first-class status conferred on the first two of these matches. In 2018, the MCC and ECB announced that the ECB would be resuming responsibility for funding the university centres from 2020 and would run a tender process for new cities to join the scheme. The change was also said to be likely to result in more T20 cricket in the programme. Despite the ECB having resumed funding, the university teams continue to use the MCC University names.

==Officers of the club==
Presidents serve a twelve-month term and cannot normally serve two terms in succession. Notable exceptions occurred during World War I and World War II. In 1914, Lord Hawke was appointed president and was asked to remain in the post till the end of the Great War. As a result, Hawke was MCC President for five years from 1914 to 1918 inclusive and was succeeded in 1919 by the former Hampshire slow left-arm bowler Henry Forster, who shortly afterwards was raised to the peerage as Lord Forster. Throughout the war, Lord&#x27;s was used for military purposes, including training and recreation. Problems frequently arose but, in &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; view, Hawke was &quot;the greatest help in giving wise counsel towards their solution&quot;.

Hawke&#x27;s tenure was exceeded by that of Stanley Christopherson who was appointed in 1939 and remained &quot;in situ&quot; for seven years until 1945 before being succeeded by General Sir Ronald Adam.

In his &quot;Barclays World of Cricket&quot; essay about the MCC Presidency, E. W. Swanton stated that &quot;there is no pretence of democracy about it&quot; commenting on how few were untitled up to the Second World War. As he observed, membership of the aristocracy was a more important factor than any cricketing prowess. This observation did indeed reflect societal change, although the Duke of Edinburgh, the Earl of Home, Lord Cowdrey and Sir Tim Rice all became President of MCC in the latter half of the 20th century. In the 21st century there have been MCC Presidents who as players were wholly professional: Tom Graveney, Derek Underwood, Mike Gatting and Matthew Fleming. The 2018–19 President, Anthony Wreford, nominated Kumar Sangakkara as his successor in May 2019; Sangakkara became MCC&#x27;s first non-British President.

Each President is required to nominate their successor at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) which takes place during his/her term of office. The club chairman and the treasurer serve a three-year term. Both are appointed by the committee (but subject to approval of the voting members). Both can serve terms in succession. The secretary and chief executive (a joint role) is the senior employee of the club and is appointed solely by the MCC committee.

The committee consists of the above officers plus the chairmen of any other committees that may exist at the time of any meeting plus twelve elected members. Elected committee members are appointed for a three-year term. An elected committee member cannot be re-elected upon retirement unless there is a gap of at least one year between terms of office.

<doc id="307443" wikidata="Q1853504" url="?curid=307443" title="List of lieutenant governors of the North-West Territories">
<text>This is a list of historical lieutenant governors of the North-West Territories, Canada. The position of Lieutenant Governor lasted from the acquisition of Rupert&#x27;s Land and the North-Western Territory in 1869 to the creation of Alberta and Saskatchewan in 1905.

Since the establishment of Saskatchewan and Alberta from the Territories&#x27; most populated regions, the territory had no lieutenant governor. Instead, a commissioner represents the federal government and acts as the representative of the King. Yukon was carved out of the North-West Territories in 1898 and has had its own commissioners since then.

<text>The Battle of Landen, also known as Battle of Neerwinden took place on 29 July 1693, during the Nine Years&#x27; War near Landen, then in the Spanish Netherlands, now part of Belgium. A French army under Marshal Luxembourg defeated an Allied force led by William III.

By 1693, all combatants were struggling with the financial and material costs of the conflict. Hoping to end the war with a favourable negotiated peace, Louis XIV of France decided first to improve his position by taking the offensive. Having achieved local superiority in numbers, Luxembourg attacked the main Allied army, which was holding positions around Landen.

Most of the fighting took place on the Allied right, which the French assaulted three times before finally breaking through. Although forced to abandon their guns, most of the Allied army retreated in good order as the French were too exhausted to initiate a pursuit.

Although the French forced the Allies from the field, as with the Battle of Steenkerque the previous year, both sides suffered heavy casualties and Louis failed to achieve the decisive result that would force the Allies to negotiate peace. William quickly replaced his losses and in 1694 achieved numerical superiority in Flanders for the first time in the war.

==Background==
Since the outbreak of the Nine Years&#x27; War in 1689, the French generally held the advantage in the Spanish Netherlands, but failed to achieve a decisive victory or divide the Grand Alliance. By 1693, the strategic situation seemed to be moving in favour of the Allies. However, all sides were now struggling with the cost of the war and catastrophic famine caused by the Little Ice Age. These factors made military operations more problematic, especially due to an increase in the average size of armies from 25,000 in 1648 to over 100,000 by 1697, levels unsustainable for pre-industrial economies.

Fighting a multi-front war on his own, Louis XIV of France was keen to reach a negotiated peace, but sought to improve his position before doing so. When the 1693 campaigning season began, Louis took the offensive in the Rhineland, Flanders and Catalonia. When the attack in Germany proved unexpectedly successful, in early June Luxembourg was ordered to reinforce it with 28,000 of his own troops and prevent the Allies doing the same. He was also ordered to capture Liège, the capital of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège.

Luxembourg increased his field force to 116,000 by stripping garrisons from towns throughout Maritime Flanders, including Dunkirk and Ypres. On 9 June, he embarked on a series of marches, simultaneously threatening Liège, Huy and Charleroi. Maximilian of Bavaria, Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, insisted on covering all three, forcing the Allies to divide their forces. However, despite his numerical superiority, Luxembourg was not strong enough to besiege Liège and keep the main Allied force at bay. To further stretch French resources, William sent 15,000 men under Ferdinand Willem of Wurttemberg into Artois, and on 18 July, the latter broke through the lines of the Scheldt near Dottignies.

In response, Luxembourg ordered Villeroy to take Huy, which surrendered on 23 July. William increased the Liège garrison to 17,000, while his remaining troops established a line running in a rough semicircle from Eliksem on the right, to Neerwinden on the left. This position provided flexibility of response, but their ability to manoeuvre was restricted by the Little Geete River, three kilometres to the rear.

Seeing an opportunity, Luxembourg reversed his route, and after a forced march of 30 kilometres, arrived at Landen in the early evening of 28 July. Since the Allied army was outnumbered by 70,000 to 50,000, he assumed William would link up with Würtemberg before risking battle. Although notified of the French approach by mid-afternoon, William decided to hold his ground despite being advised to slip across the river at night. Factors behind this decision included lack of cavalry to cover an orderly retreat, while the small battlefield would prevent Luxembourg making full use of his superior numbers.

The Allies hastily constructed earthworks running between Laar and Neerwinden, containing 80 of their 91 pieces of heavy artillery. While less effective against infantry attack or artillery bombardment, these provided protection from the superior French cavalry. In the centre, the open ground between Neerwinden and Neerlanden was solidly entrenched, with the village of Rumsdorp on the centre-left as an advance post. The left rested on Landen brook and was the hardest to attack.

Maximilian commanded the Allied right, with the centre led by William himself, and Henry Casimir II the left. These were drawn up in conventional formation, with the infantry in front and cavalry to the rear. Luxembourg concentrated his main assault force of 28,000 men against the Allied right, while his centre and right under Villeroy and Prince de Conti respectively conducted simultaneous attacks to prevent William reinforcing his right. A strong force of infantry and dragoons was designated to attack Rumsdorp. In this formation his tightly packed French lines in the centre were, however, optimal targets for Allied artillery.

==Battle==
===Artillery duel and the first French assault===
The artillery duel probably started between 6:00 and 7:00. The army of the Dutch Republic always possessed very large amounts of artillery and the Allied artillery regiments were better equipped than those of the French. The duel thus went largely in favour of the Allies and they inflicted terrible destruction on the French. With about 150 artillery pieces in total, it was very intense. In a letter to the Prince of Condé the Prince de Conti wrote: 

Count Solms, general of the Allied infantry, was mortally wounded in this phase of the battle. Somewhere between 8 and 9 a.m. the French began their attack on Laar and Neerwinden. Three assault columns, consisting of 28 battalions, launched a furious attack; Berwick in the middle stormed Neerwinden, while to his left the Lieutenant-General Rubantel and to his right the Lieutenant-General De Montchevreuil, supported his attack. Laar was soon captured, but things went less well for the French in Neerwinden. Here the French had to take every part of the village separately and the defenders fought with great bravery. Berwick managed to gain ground only slowly. While this was going on, French cavalry, after conquering Laar, pushed across the Laar Brook and attacked the Spanish cavalry, which it overran. But the French were in turn thrown back across the stream with great losses. This attack, however, caused the gunners of English battery on the heights behind Laar to evacuate their position without receiving orders to do so.

Berwick penetrated through to the edge of Neerwinden, but Rubantel and Montchevreuil, were unable to keep advancing on beside him, and, in the face of the great fire directed by the defender at their flanks, deviated more and more towards the centre of the village and finally retreated behind Berwick. This would become fatal to them. A counterattack by the Elector of Bavaria on the flanks of Rubantel and Montchevreuil forced them both out of the village and then Berwick&#x27;s corps, after which Laar was also recaptured. This important counterattack, carried out with the help of English battalions from the centre sent by William III, restored the original allied lines. The French had suffered very heavy losses, Montchevreuil had been killed and Berwick captured.

Shortly after the commencement of the attack on Neerwinden and Laar, the French center made an attempt to breach the fortified line of the Allies. However, this effort was quickly abandoned. The foremost line of the French cavalry, comprising the elite Maison du Roi, advanced as if to storm it, but encountered a formidable gunfire, prompting a hasty retreat.

A little later, the French also attacked Rumsdorp and Neerlanden. Rumsdorp was taken by them, but their attack on the entrenched line behind it was repulsed. East of the Landen Brook, dismounted dragoons stormed Neerlanden, penetrated it twice, but were thrown back each time. Here the fight took on a ferocity that was not at all in Luxemburg&#x27;s intention. The Dutch artillerymen had switched to canister shot and were killing hundreds of French troops. The streets became clogged with piles of corpses and wounded soldiers. Both William and Luxembourg rushed to this wing. William with reinforcments, while Luxembourg expressed his displeasure and ordered that they should fall back and stick to holding the outer fence of Rumsdorp. Luxembourg then returned to his left wing, where the battered troops of the assault on Neerwinden were gathered. He reorganised and reinforced this wing with 7,000 men from his general reserve and ordered a second attack on Laar and Neerwinden, this time led by the Prince de Conti.

===Second French assault===
This second attack took much the same course as the first. Again, Laar was taken first; in Neerwinden the defender fought behind hedges and walls and from the houses with great courage and perseverance, without however being able to prevent de Conti from slowly penetrating to the northern edge of the village. Here, however, the defenders (under which the English First Foot Guards, the Scots Guards and a battalion of Dutch Blue Guards) again held their ground through great effort. Again William III rushed in with English battalions to the action, and counterattacked. With the exception of the south-western edge, Neerwinden was recaptured after a long and bloody battle and then Laar too. The stubbornness with which 44 French and probably 33 German and English battalions, 30,000 to 40,000 men in all, fought here in a confined space and a short distance caused very heavy losses on both sides.

Midday was approaching and Luxembourg was still far from accomplishing his intended goal. His subordinates advised him, in view of the sinking courage of his troops and the great losses his infantry had suffered, to break off the fight. But Luxembourg decided otherwise. He still had 20 battalions of infantry in reserve, including seven battalions of the Maison du Roi, the elite of the French army, and his cavalry of 30,000 men was still almost intact.

===Third French assault and breakthrough===
Luxembourg took 7,000 infantry from his centre and left wing for a third attack on the allied right. He ordered an attack with the entire infantry at once, while personally leading the attack on Laar and Neerwinden. William again moved additional English units to meet this threat, but this could not prevent the villages from finally both falling into French hands after very heavy fighting. They were helped in this by the depletion of the defenders&#x27; ammunition. The cavalry of the Maison du Roi immediately charged the discouraged Hanoverian cavalry, but were checked by several battalions of Dutch infantry whom William had brought up from the Allied centre. The Dutch were in turn forced to retreat by an attack of the French and Swiss Guards. This gave the other French troops in the vicinity of Neerwinden the opportunity to break through the entrenchments of the Allies.

At the same time as the assault on Neerwinden and Laar de Feuquières ordered French infantry from Rumsdorp to secure a passage through the Allied centre, which had been largely deserted. He then brought up his cavalry to form up on the other side of the Allied entrenchments. Around this moment the Dutch artillerymen ceased their fire and retreated. Probably to avoid falling into the hands of the advancing enemy.

This French breakthrough happened around 15:00 and an hour later William ordered the Allies to retreat over the Geete. Doing so they abandoned most of their artillery which was entrenched and could not be withdrawn in time. There were by now 125 squadrons behind the allied lines and the battle had dissolved into a hand-to-hand combat of 30,000 to 40,000 horsemen clashing in a space of less than three square kilometres. This quickly took on the characteristics of a rearguard action. Maximilian of Bavaria and his German and Spanish cavalry were swiftly overwhelmed and forced to retreat across the Gete. The charges of the Dutch and English cavalry, under the personal leadership of William, were more successful. William led a number of cavalry charges himself, was nearly captured, but succeeded in slowing the French down and gained time for his pursued troops to scramble across the river. Although the retreat on the right was carried out in disarray, both William and Maximilian managed to get to safety.

The Dano-Dutch left wing under Hendrik Casimir fared better in their retreat, despite the strong resistance they faced. During their retreat his troops faced not only the enemy infantry in Rumsdorp and Attenhoven, but also the majority of the 125 French squadrons under Feuquières, which surrounded them from all sides. They however managed to fight their way through the French over a distance of about 7 kilometres and crossed the Geete in good order. Another Nine battalions of Dutch and Danish infantry under brigadier François Nicolas Fagel who were cut off close to Rumsdorp fought a stubborn rearguard action, but also crossed the river in good order. A few hundred allied horsemen had drowned trying to cross the Geete, but, supported by several British units holding positions around the bridge most of the army had reached the other side of the river by 17:00 and continued their retreat, undisturbed by the French cavalry.

== Aftermath ==
Whereas usually French generals announced their victories with much detail and praise, this time Luxembourg sent only a summary message to the king. Landen might have been a crushing victory if the simultaneous attacks he ordered on the Allied left and centre had gone as planned. As it was, both sides suffered heavy casualties. However, estimated casualties varied widely. The French themselves claimed to have lost between 7,000 and 8,000 men, which was strongly disputed by the Allies. French officer De la Colonie also came to a different conclusion and wrote that they had lost 18,000 to 20,000 men: Estimates of Allied losses range from 8,000 to 18,000 killed and wounded, with another 1,500 or 2,000 captured. A visitor to the area in 1707 noted the fields were still scattered with the bones of the dead.

William had a silver medal struck to celebrate his success in &#x27;saving Liege&#x27; and escaping with the bulk of his troops. This was partly propaganda to counter the Battle of Lagos on 27 June, when the French intercepted a large Anglo-Dutch convoy and inflicted serious commercial damage, but there was also truth to the claim. Luxembourg&#x27;s infantry was so battered that he indeed had to refrain from besieging Liège, while the return of Württemberg&#x27;s corps meant that the Allies were able to replace their losses within days. A mutiny even broke out in the French army in which entire regiments rioted and demanded payment of back pay in threatening fashion. Louis XIV sent money and ordered Luxembourg to return to the French border to reassure the troops that they did not have to fight another battle. For these reasons it has been suggested by some writers that the battle was actually a strategic victory for William.

The fact that William was able to save Liège and Maastricht from an attack, and the success of the Duke of Württemberg&#x27;s raid in French Flanders meant that the 1693 campaign could be seen as overall Allied success. Still, the loss of Namur in 1692 followed by the defeat at Landen was evidence to William and Anthonie Heinsius, the Dutch Grand Pensionary, that the numerical inferiority of the Allies made it difficult to effectively protect the Spanish Netherlands. As a result, the Anglo-Dutch armies grew significantly in the following years, allowing William and the Allied army to assume the offensive and gain the initiative. Huy was recaptured in 1694 and Namur the next year. 

Although Luxembourg has been criticised for failing to exploit his victory, his troops were exhausted, while the poor harvests of previous years meant a lack of forage for the horses and baggage train needed to pursue his opponents. The problem was so acute that capturing the Allied artillery proved a mixed blessing, as the French scarcely had sufficient to move their own. To still make something of the campaign Louis ordered Luxembourg to besiege the strategically unimportant but strong town of Charleroi. Its 4,000 strong Spanish garrison resisted for a month, but surrendered on the 13th of October, having lost more than half of its strength. Landen would be Luxembourg&#x27;s last battle as he died in January 1695, depriving Louis of his best general.

==Legacy==
The Irish Brigade fought on the French side and suffered severe losses; including the Irish Jacobite hero Patrick Sarsfield, who was mortally wounded during an attack on the village of Neerwinden.

Laurence Sterne&#x27;s famous 1759 picaresque novel &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; contains various references to the Nine Years&#x27; War, mostly the 1695 Second Siege of Namur. However, Corporal Trim refers to the Battle of Landen as follows:

&quot;Your honour remembers with concern, said the corporal, the total rout and confusion of our camp and army at the affair of Landen; every one was left to shift for himself; and if it had not been for the regiments of Wyndham, Lumley, and Galway, which covered the retreat over the bridge Neerspeeken, the king himself could scarce have gained it – he was press&#x27;d hard, as your honour knows, on every side of him...&quot;

It is during this battle that, seeing the French determination to gain the high ground in spite of the murderous Allied bombardment, William is alleged to have exclaimed &quot;Oh! That insolent nation!&quot;.

<doc id="307452" wikidata="Q465099" url="?curid=307452" title="American Independent Party">
<text>The American Independent Party (AIP) is an American political party that was established in 1967. The American Independent Party is best known for its nomination of Democratic then-former Governor George Wallace of Alabama, who carried five states in the 1968 presidential election running against Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey on a populist, hard-line anti-Communist, pro-&quot;law and order&quot; platform, appealing to working-class white voters. Wallace was best known for his staunch segregationist stances. In 1976, the party split into the modern American Independent Party and the American Party. From 1992 until 2008, the party was the California affiliate of the national Constitution Party. Its exit from the Constitution Party led to a leadership dispute during the 2008 election.

==History==
===Wallace campaign and early history===

In 1967, the AIP was founded by Bill Shearer and his wife, Eileen Knowland Shearer. It nominated George C. Wallace (Democrat) as its presidential candidate and retired U.S. Air Force General Curtis E. LeMay (Republican) as the vice-presidential candidate. Wallace ran on every state ballot in the election, though he did not represent the American Independent Party in all fifty states: in Connecticut, for instance, he was listed on the ballot as the nominee of the &quot;George Wallace Party.&quot; The Wallace/LeMay ticket received 13.5 percent of the popular vote and 46 electoral votes from the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and Alabama. No third-party candidate has won more than one electoral vote since the 1968 election.

In 1969, representatives from forty states established the American Party as the successor to the American Independent Party. In some places, such as Connecticut, the American Party was constituted as the American Conservative Party. (The modern American Conservative Party, founded in 2008, is unrelated to the Wallace-era party.) In March 1969, the party ran a candidate in a special election in Tennessee&#x27;s 8th congressional district in northwestern Tennessee, where Wallace had done well the previous November, to replace Congressman Robert &quot;Fats&quot; Everett, who had died in office. Their candidate, William J. Davis, out-polled Republican Leonard Dunavant, with 16,375 votes to Dunavant&#x27;s 15,773; but the race was carried by moderate Democrat Ed Jones, with 33,028 votes (47% of the vote).

The party flag, adopted on August 30, 1970, depicts an eagle holding a group of arrows in its left talons, over a compass rose, with a banner which reads &quot;The American Independent Party&quot; at the eagle&#x27;s base.

The American Party had gained ballot access in Tennessee in 1970 as the result of George Wallace&#x27;s strong (second-place) showing in the state in 1968, easily crossing the 5 percent threshold required, and held a primary election which nominated a slate of candidates including businessman Douglas Heinsohn for governor. However, neither Heinsohn nor any other candidate running on the American Party line achieved the 5 percent threshold in the 1970 Tennessee election, and it likewise failed to do so in 1972, meaning that the party lost its newfound ballot access, which as of 2021 it has never regained.

In 1972, the American Party nominated Republican Congressman John G. Schmitz of California for president and Tennessee author Thomas Jefferson Anderson, both members of the John Birch Society, for vice president, winning the party over 1.1 million votes, the highest vote share the party has ever achieved since Wallace&#x27;s run. That year, Hall Lyons, a petroleum industry executive and former Republican, ran as the AP nominee in Louisiana for the United States Senate but finished last in a four-way race dominated by the Democratic nominee, J. Bennett Johnston, Jr.

===After the 1976 split===
In 1976, the American Independent Party split into the more moderate American Party, which included more northern conservatives and Schmitz supporters, and the American Independent Party, which focused on the Deep South. Both parties have nominated candidates for the presidency and other offices. Neither the American Party nor the American Independent Party has had national success, and the American Party has not achieved ballot status in any state since 1996.

In the early 1980s, Bill Shearer led the American Independent Party into the Populist Party. From 1992 to 2008, the American Independent Party was the California affiliate of the national Constitution Party, formerly the U.S. Taxpayers Party, whose founders included the late Howard Phillips.

===2007 leadership dispute===
A split in the American Independent Party occurred during the 2008 presidential campaign, with one faction recognizing Jim King as chairman of the AIP with the other recognizing Ed Noonan as chairman. Noonan&#x27;s faction claims the old AIP main website while the King organization claims the AIP&#x27;s blog. King&#x27;s group met in Los Angeles on June 28–29, elected King to state chair. Ed Noonan&#x27;s faction, which included 8 of the 17 AIP officers, held a convention in Sacramento on July 5, 2008. Issues in the split were U.S. foreign policy and the influence of Constitution Party founder Howard Phillips on the state party.

The King group elected to stay in the Constitution Party and supported its presidential candidate, Chuck Baldwin. It was not listed as the &quot;Qualified Political Party&quot; by the California Secretary of State and Baldwin&#x27;s name was not printed on the state&#x27;s ballots. King&#x27;s group sued for ballot access and their case was dismissed without prejudice.

The Noonan group voted to pull out of the Constitution Party and join a new party called America&#x27;s Party, put together by perennial candidate and former United Nations Ambassador Alan Keyes as a vehicle for his own presidential campaign. Since Noonan was on record with the California Secretary of State as (outgoing) party chairman, Keyes was added to the state ballots as the AIP candidate. This group elected Markham Robinson as its new chair at the convention.

===Presidential tickets===
Following the split within the American Independent Party into factions led by Jim King and Ed Noonan, the Noonan faction has maintained control over the party&#x27;s operations and ballot access in California. The party did not nominate Chuck Baldwin, the 2008 Constitution Party presidential candidate, nor Virgil Goode, the 2012 nominee, and both candidates were unable to secure independent positions on the California presidential ballot.

== California membership issues ==
In 2016, approximately 3% of California&#x27;s 17.2 million voters were registered with the American Independent Party (AIP), ranking it as the third-largest political party in the state by registration, following the Democratic (43%) and Republican (28%) parties and those who registered as &quot;no party preference&quot; (24%).

However, it has long been proposed by political analysts that the party, which has received very few votes in recent California elections, maintains its state ballot status because people join the American Independent Party mistakenly believing that they are registering as &quot;independent&quot; voters. 

A 2016 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; investigation suggested that a significant number of voters registered with the AIP may have done so under the misconception that they were registering as independent, unaffiliated voters, which is officially designated as &quot;no party preference&quot; in California. A poll of voters registered with the AIP indicated that a majority may not have intended to register with the party. The investigation highlighted potential confusion caused by the party&#x27;s name. 

A 2016 poll conducted of California voters registered with the AIP showed that 73% identify themselves as &quot;no affiliation&quot; and 3% identify themselves as &quot;undecided.&quot; Upon learning the AIP platform, 50% of registered AIP voters wanted to leave the AIP. A &quot;Times&quot; review of voting records revealed a wide array of Californians have fallen victim to this error, including celebrities such as Sugar Ray Leonard, Demi Moore, Emma Stone, and Kaley Cuoco. Similarly, in 2008, Jennifer Siebel, then-fiancée of San Francisco&#x27;s former Democratic mayor Gavin Newsom, attempted to change her party affiliation from Republican to unaffiliated, but &quot;checked the American Independent box thinking that was what independent voters were supposed to do.&quot;

This confusion results in accidentally registered AIP members being unable to vote in presidential primary elections and, in prior years, in all partisan primary elections other than those of the AIP. A number of California registrars of voters had expressed concern over the confusion that the party&#x27;s name causes. Kim Alexander, president of the nonpartisan California Voter Foundation, said that the California voter form was &quot;confusing and somewhat misleading.&quot; However, since the advent of the &quot;top-two&quot; blanket primary in California in 2012, all voters may participate in non-presidential primary elections where nominations for public office are to be made. Presidential nominations and elections of members of party county central committees are still restricted to voters registered in the party where such contests are held, but a party may choose to allow voters with No Party Preference to vote in their presidential primary. In addition, voters are able to re-register to the party of their choosing on election day via election day registration, mitigating the issue further.

<text>Romanian literature () is the entirety of literature written by Romanian authors, although the term may also be used to refer to all literature written in the Romanian language or by any authors native to Romania.

==Old Romanian literature==
The development of Romanian literature has taken place in parallel with that of the rich Romanian folklore – lyric, epic, dramatic and didactic – which continues in modern times. Romanian oral literature includes doine (lyric songs), &quot;balade&quot; (ballads), hore (dance songs), colinde (carols), &quot;basme&quot; (fairy tales), &quot;snoave&quot; (anecdotes), &quot;vorbe&quot; (proverbs), and &quot;ghicitori&quot; (riddles). The folk pastoral ballad &quot;Miorița&quot; is one of the best known examples of Romanian folk literature.

===Medieval Slavonic literature===

The Script of Old Church Slavonic began to be used in the territories of current day Romania as early as the 10th Century, with the oldest surviving manuscripts being dated as far back as the 12th Century. The earliest dated texts in Slavonic, originally from Wallachia and Moldavia, consist of a series of Religious Songs by Nicodim &amp; Filotei and a Hagiographical text by Grigore Țamblâc, all being dated between 1385 and 1391. Also by the 15th century many copies of medieval Slavonic texts have been created by the scribes of the Danubian Principalities.

In the meantime numerous Slavonic and Greek translations of popular medieval romances were in circulation across the Danubian Principalities, like the Alexander Romance and Barlaam and Josaphat.

Particularly of note is &quot;The Teachings of Neagoe Basarab to his son Theodosie:&quot; a series of teachings on morality and politics, written between 1519 and 1521, by the Wallachian Lord Neagoe Basarab, a work written in the spirit of the Renaissance and considered one of the oldest great works of Southeastern European literature.

===Beginning of writing and publishing in Romanian===

The earliest surviving document in Romanian that can be precisely dated is Neacșu&#x27;s Letter written in 1521, to the &quot;jude&quot; (&quot;judge and mayor&quot;) of Brașov, Hans Benkner.

The earliest books in Romanian were translated from Slavonic religious texts in the 15th century. &quot;Psaltirea Hurmuzaki&quot;, &quot;Codicele Voronețean&quot;, &quot;Psaltirea Voronețeană&quot;, &quot;Psaltirea Scheiană&quot;, and others are religious texts from Moldavia that carry evidence of being translations of manuscripts written in the other languages in the Banat-Hunedoara area.

The first book printed in the Danubian Principalities was a Slavonic religious book, printed in 1508 at Dealu Monastery. The first book printed in the Romanian language was a Protestant catechism of Deacon Coresi in 1559, printed by Filip Moldoveanul. Other translations from Greek and Slavonic books were printed later in the 16th century. Dosoftei, a Moldavian Bishop, in 1673, published the first Romanian metrical psalter, the earliest collection of poems written in Romanian.

Early efforts to publish the Bible in Romanian started with the 1582 printing in the small town of Orăștie of the so-called &quot;Palia de la Orăștie&quot; – a translation of the first books of the Old Testament – by Deacon Șerban (a son of the above-mentioned Deacon Coresi) and Marien Diacul (Marien the Scribe). &quot;Palia&quot; was translated from Latin by Bishop Mihail Tordaș &quot;et al.&quot;, the translation being checked for accuracy using Hungarian translations of the Bible.

The entire Bible was not published in Romanian until the end of the 17th century, when the Metropolitanate&#x27;s Press of Bucharest printed &quot;Biblia de la București&quot; (&quot;The Bucharest Bible&quot;) in 1688, compiled by the Greceanu Brothers.

In Transylvania, there was also an attestation of the explicit use of a Latin model, with the appearance of the first Romanian dictionary, &quot;Dictionarium Valachico-Latinum&quot; (Caransebeș, about 1650), while the first grammar of the Romanian language written in Latin was &quot;Institutiones linguae Valachicae&quot; (Crișana, circa 1770).

=== Humanism ===

The first appearances of humanism in Moldavia and Wallachia were in the 16th century with the likes of Luca Stroici and Petru Cercel, but it took another century for these ideas to fully flourish. This delay can be attributed to the continuation of Byzantine culture in the Danubian Principalities, or to the different social classes compared to Western Europe.

During the 17th century via Poland and its Jesuit schools, having as representatives the likes of Grigore Ureche, Miron Costin, and Ion Neculce with their chronicles on the history of Moldavia. Following the example of Petro Movilă&#x27;s Kyiv Colegium, the Lords Matei Basarab and Vasile Lupu established Neoclassical schools such as the Schola Graeca et Latina and the Iași Colegiu.

The most significant Romanian humanist was Dimitrie Cantemir, who wrote histories of Wallachia, Moldavia and the Ottoman Empire, and philosophical and religious treaties such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Indescribable Image of Sacred Science&quot;, and &quot;The Little Compendium of Logic&quot;. He also wrote the Roman à clef &quot;A Hieroglyphic History&quot; in 1705.

===Enlightenment===
In 18th century Transylvania, throughout the Blaj Schools of Inocențiu Micu-Klein, a Latinist and Enlightenment movement, the Școala Ardeleană emerged, producing philological studies of the Romantic origin of the Romanian language. Among the many works on Romanian history and the Romanian language by Samuil Micu-Klein, Gheorghe Șincai and Petru Maior, the &quot;Heroic-comic-satiric Poem&quot; &quot;Țiganiada&quot; by Ion Budai-Deleanu, can also be found, promoting democratic and enlightenment ideals.

In Wallachia and Moldavia, the Enlightenment can be seen in the Poems and Prose of Iancu Văcărescu, Costache Conachi, and Dinicu Golescu.

==National awakening==

In 1829, in Wallachia, Ion Heliade Rădulescu founded the first Romanian-language Newspaper, Curierul Românesc, and cofounded the Philharmonic Society which later created the National Theatre of Bucharest. Albina Românească, a similar publication to Curierul Românesc was started contemporaneously by Gheorghe Asachi in Moldavia.

===Pașoptism===
In the 1800s, the revolutionary ideas of nationalism spreading in Europe were also circulating among Romanians who desired national independence from the Ottoman Empire. These nationalistic attitudes led to the revolutions of 1821 and 1848. These ideas were mainly propagated by Mihail Kogălniceanu&#x27;s publication, Dacia Literară, which was adapting French Romanticism to Romanian writing with the purpose of creating an original national literature.

The works of these writers, later dubbed Pașoptists (after the Revolution of 1848), have been shown not only to contain Romantic but also Neoclassical and Realist traits. Vasile Alecsandri was a prolific writer, contributing to Romanian literature with poetry, prose, the &quot;Chirița&quot; plays (1850–1875), historical dramas such as &quot;Despot Vodă&quot; (1879), and collections of Romanian folklore. Also, taking inspiration from history, Constantin Negruzzi wrote the novella Alexandru Lăpușneanul (1840). Other Pașoptist writers include Vasile Cârlova, Grigore Alexandrescu, Anton Pann, and Alecu Donici.

===Junimea===
The literary circle Junimea, founded in Iași in 1863 by Titu Maiorescu, Petre P. Carp, Vasile Pogor, Theodor Rosetti and Iacob Negruzzi began publishing the magazine &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot; in1867, which eventually became the most important Romanian language literary publication in the 2nd half of the 19th century and 1st half of the 20th century. Through his links with Junimea, literary critic Titu Maiorescu set the direction of synchronizing Romanian literature both with other European literary movements and with Romanian folklore.

Many outstanding Romanian writers, including George Coșbuc and Barbu Ştefănescu Delavrancea, published their works in &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot;. 

Other notable authors of this era are Nicolae Bălcescu, Dimitrie Bolintineanu, Alecu Russo, Nicolae Filimon, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Alexandru Odobescu, Grigore Alexandrescu and Petre Ispirescu.

===The beginnings of the Romanian novel===
The first Romanian novel is considered to be &quot;Manoil&quot; (published in 1855) by Dimitrie Bolintineanu (if one excludes from the definition of novel the allegorical literary work &quot;Istoria ieroglifică&quot; by Dimitrie Cantemir, which was written between 1703 – 1705). Bolintineanu also published the novel Elena (1862). However these two novels are largely forgotten, although they are considered relevant from the point of view of describing Romanian society in the mid-19th century. Nicolae Filimon is considered the father of the Romanian novel, having written the influential novel &quot;Ciocoii vechi și noi&quot; (1863).

===The great classics===

Among the many writers of Junimea, four are considered to be the Great Classics of Romanian Literature: the poet Mihai Eminescu, the satirist Ion Luca Caragiale, Ioan Slavici, and Ion Creangă.

Mihai Eminescu is considered by many critics to be the most important and influential Romanian poet. His lyrical poetry has its roots in Romanian folklore intertwined with Kantian and Schopenhauer&#x27;s philosophy and Buddhist cosmology. Among his greatest poems are the romantic poems &quot;Floare Albastră&quot; (1872) and &quot;Luceafărul&quot;, as well as the series of five philosophical poems called &quot;Letters&quot; (1881–1890).

Ioan Slavici is one of the best known Romanian novella writers. His works can be categorized as Realist Bildungsromans. They are mainly set in Transylvania and have Moralistic psychological undertones. His most famous works are the novellas &quot;Moara cu noroc&quot; and &quot;Popa Tanda&quot;, and the novel &quot;Mara&quot;.

Ion Luca Caragiale, wrote some of the best Romanian comedies, sketches and farces. Among his best known plays are &quot;O Noapte Furtunoasă&quot; (1879), &quot;O Scrisoare Pierdută&quot; (1884), and &quot;D-ale Carnavalului&quot; (1885).

Ion Creangă wrote personalized retellings of folkloric tales, of which some of the best known are &quot;Povestea lui Harap Alb&quot; (1877), &quot;Păcală&quot; (1880), and &quot;Făt-Frumos fiul Iepei&quot; (1877). Of further note are his autobiographical memoirs from &quot;Amintiri din copilarie&quot;.

===Sămănătorism and Poporanism===

From 1901 to 1910, through the activity of the publication &quot;Sămănătorul&quot;, founded by George Coșbuc and Alexandru Vlahuță, and later under the editorial watch of historian Nicolae Iorga, a new literary movement formed. A movement concentrated on preserving traditional values and idealising rural life, a continuation Eminescu&#x27;s Romanticism.

Among &quot;Sămănătorul&quot;&#x27;s authors were George Coșbuc a poet, translator, teacher, and journalist, best known for his verses describing, praising and eulogizing rural life, author of Pașa Hasan, Nunta Zamfirei and Moartea lui Fulger; but also Alexandru Vlahuță, Octavian Goga, Duiliu Zamfirescu, Ștefan O. Iosif, Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, Ion Agârbiceanu and Alexandru Macedonski. Although Goga and Agârbiceanu have become later associated with Poporanism and the publication, Viața Românească.

==Interbellum literature==

After achieving national unity in 1918, Romanian literature entered what can be called a golden age, characterized by two opposite literary movements, Traditionalism and Modernism, and by the development of the Romanian novel. The interwar period of Romanian literature was a very rich and creative time, with numerous literary works being published during that period, addressing a variety of themes, including historical novels, novels depicting rural life, war, romantic love, social class and existential themes .

Traditional society and recent political events influenced works such as Liviu Rebreanu&#x27;s &quot;Răscoala&quot; (&quot;The Uprising&quot;, 1932), which was inspired by the 1907 Romanian Peasants&#x27; Revolt, and &quot;Pădurea Spânzuraților&quot; (&quot;Forest of the Hanged&quot;), published in 1922 and inspired by Romanian participation in World War I. Rebreanu&#x27;s novel &quot;Ion&quot;, published in 1920, presents the life of peasants and intellectuals in early twentieth century Transylvania, and is said to be the most read Romanian novel. The dawn of the modern novel can be seen in Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu&#x27;s &quot;Concert din muzică de Bach&quot; (&quot;A Bach Concert&quot;), Camil Petrescu&#x27;s &quot;Ultima noapte de dragoste, întâia noapte de război&quot; (&quot;The Last Night of Love, the First Night of War&quot;) and Mateiu Caragiale’s &quot;Craii de Curtea-Veche (&quot;&quot;The Rakes of Old Court&quot;). George Călinescu is another complex personality of Romanian literature: novelist, playwright, poet, literary critic and historian, essayist, journalist. He published authoritative monographs about Eminescu and Creangă, and a monumental (almost 1,000 pages in quarto) history of Romanian literature from its origin to the time of his writing (1941). He is also the author of the novel &quot;Enigma Otliei&quot; (&quot;The Enigma of Otilia&quot;).
An important realist writer was Mihail Sadoveanu, who wrote mainly novels which took place at various times in the history of Moldova. But probably the most important writers were Tudor Arghezi, Lucian Blaga, and Mircea Eliade. Arghezi revolutionized Romanian poetry 50 years after Eminescu, creating new pillars for the modern Romanian poem. Blaga, one of the country&#x27;s most important artistic personalities, developed through his writings a complex system of philosophy, still not perfectly understood today. Eliade is today considered the greatest historian in the field of religions. His novels reveal a mystical, pre-Christian symbolism paving the way for contemporary Romanian art.

Born in Romania, Tristan Tzara, a poet and essayist, is the main founder of Dada, a nihilistic revolutionary movement in the arts, and may have been responsible for its name (Romanian for &quot;Yes yes&quot;). Later he abandoned nihilism for Surrealism and Marxism. For the first time in its history, Romanian culture was fully connected to Western culture, while Dadaism is the first Romanian artistic and literary movement to become international. Dadaism and Surrealism are fundamental parts of the avant-garde, the most revolutionary form of modernism. The Romanian &quot;avant garde&quot; is very well represented by Ion Minulescu, Gherasim Luca, Urmuz, Perpessicius, Tristan Tzara, Grigore Cugler, Geo Bogza, Barbu Fundoianu, Gellu Naum, Ilarie Voronca, and Ion Vinea. Max Blecher was a novelist whose life was cut short by health problems.

George Bacovia was a symbolist poet. While he initially belonged to the local Symbolist movement, his poetry came to be seen as a precursor of Romanian Modernism. Some important literary figures of this period were also active in other domains. Vasile Voiculescu was a Romanian poet, short-story writer, playwright, and physician. Ion Barbu was a poet, as well as an important mathematician.

Cezar Petrescu was a journalist, novelist, and children&#x27;s writer. He is especially remembered for his children&#x27;s book &quot;Fram, ursul polar&quot; (&quot;Fram, the polar bear&quot;; the circus animal character was named after &quot;Fram&quot;, the ship used by Fridtjof Nansen on his expeditions). Elena Farago was also a children&#x27;s writer and poet.

Ion Agârbiceanu was a writer, as well as a politician, theologian and Greek-Catholic priest. Gala Galaction was another writer, who was also an Eastern Orthodox clergyman and theologian.

Other literary figures of this era include Mihail Sebastian, Ionel Teodoreanu, Panait Istrati, Gib Mihăescu, Anton Holban, Otilia Cazimir, Ion Pillat and George Topîrceanu.

==Postbellum Literature==

Marin Preda is an important post-World War II Romanian novelist. His novel, &quot;Moromeții&quot; (&quot;The Moromete Family&quot;), describes the life and difficulties of an ordinary peasant family in pre-war Romania, and later during the advent of Communism in Romania. His most important book remains &quot;Cel mai iubit dintre pământeni&quot; (&quot;The Most Beloved of Earthlings&quot;), a cruel description of communist society. Zaharia Stancu published his first important novel, &quot;Desculț&quot; (Barefoot), in 1948. Both Preda and Stancu depicted rural life in Southern Romania (both writers were born in Teleorman County).

Some of the most important poets are Nichita Stănescu, Marin Sorescu, Ana Blandiana, Leonid Dimov, and Ștefan Augustin Doinaș. An important novelist of this era was Radu Tudoran. Mircea Nedelciu was a short-story writer, novelist, essayist and literary critic.

Outside Romania, Eugène Ionesco and Emil Cioran represented the national spirit at the highest level. Ionesco is one of the foremost playwrights of the Theatre of the Absurd. Beyond ridiculing the most banal situations, Ionesco&#x27;s plays depict in a tangible way the solitude of humans and the insignificance of one&#x27;s existence. Cioran was a writer and philosopher.

<text>Avaya LLC(), formerly Avaya Inc., is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Morristown, New Jersey, that provides cloud communications and workstream collaboration services. The company&#x27;s platform includes unified communications and contact center services. In 2019, the company provided services to 220,000 customer locations in 190 countries.

==History==
In 1995, AT&amp;T Corporation renamed their subsidiary AT&amp;T Technologies to Lucent Technologies and spun it off in 1996. Lucent subsequently spun off units of its own in an attempt to restructure its struggling operations.

Avaya Inc. was spun off from Lucent as its own company in 2000 (Lucent merged with Alcatel SA in 2006, becoming Alcatel-Lucent, which was purchased in turn by Nokia in 2016). Avaya Inc. were listed on the NYSE using the symbol AV from 2000 to 2007. In October 2007, Avaya Inc. was acquired for $8.2 billion by Sierra Holdings Corp owned by two private-equity firms, TPG Capital and Silver Lake Partners. On June 6, 2011 Sierra Holdings Corp. was renamed Avaya Holdings Corp.

On November 19, 2014, Avaya was confirmed as the naming rights partner for the San Jose Earthquakes&#x27; new stadium, officially called Avaya Stadium, paying $20 million over a 10-year deal.

On January 19, 2017, Avaya Inc. and related affiliates including Avaya Holdings Corp. petitioned for protection from creditors during reorganizing under Chapter 11 bankruptcy. A restructuring plan for Avaya Holdings Corp. agreed upon during mediation was given effect by the court&#x27;s order November 28, 2017.

In December 2017, Avaya requested a federal judge to reduce their commitment to the Earthquakes&#x27; stadium name agreement. After Avaya vacated their naming rights, the venue was renamed Earthquakes Stadium in 2020 and PayPal Park in 2021 after PayPal bought the naming rights.

On December 15, 2017, trading in Avaya Holdings Corp. shares listed on the NYSE began under the symbol AVYA.

On February 14, 2023, Avaya once again petitioned for protection from creditors during restructuring under Chapter 11 with a restructuring plan already agreed on with their creditors. On February 15, 2023 the NYSE announced that shares of Avaya no longer qualified for listing on the New York Exchange and would cease to be traded there. Although the proposed restructuring plan would wipe out the shares, several securities dealers announced that they would begin making a market in Avaya shares effective February 16, 2023 using the symbol AVYAQ and trading &#x27;over the counter&#x27;, i.e. a securities dealer is a counterparty of each trade. On May 1, 2023, Avaya Holdings Corp. completed its financial restructuring, emerging from bankruptcy owned by its former creditors as the private company Avaya LLC.

==Acquisitions and partnerships==
Since 2001, Avaya has sold and acquired several companies. Through Nortel&#x27;s bankruptcy proceedings, assets related to their Enterprise Voice and Data business units were auctioned. Avaya placed a $900 million bid, and was announced as the winner of the assets on September 14, 2009. In 1985, Performance Engineering Corporation (later PEC Solutions) was formed to offer technology services to government customers. On June 6, 2005, Nortel acquired PEC Solutions to form Nortel PEC Solutions. On January 18, 2006, Nortel PEC Solutions was renamed Nortel Government Solutions. On December 21, 2009, Avaya acquired Nortel&#x27;s government business as part of the company&#x27;s assets sale.

In October 2019, Avaya entered into a strategic partnership with RingCentral and together, introduced a new unified communications as a service solution called Avaya Cloud Office (&quot;ACO&quot;). RingCentral also contributed $500 million to be the exclusive provider of the new Avaya UCaaS offering.

==Locations and customers==
Avaya&#x27;s headquarters are at 350 Mt. Kemble Avenue, Morristown, New Jersey 07960 US. In 2020, the company had a presence in approximately 190 countries.

The company claims that its cloud services are utilized by over 90% of the Fortune 100 organizations. Avaya enterprise customers include Apple, AT&amp;T, Dell, CVS Health, as well as government organizations.

Avaya sponsors the IAUG users&#x27; group and training programs for IT professional certification in the use of Avaya&#x27;s products.

Avaya provides business related equipment for its customers such as cameras, collaboration units, conference phones, headsets, IP phones, room systems, Vantage, and wireless handsets. These devices are compatible with various options for the three services provided to its customers as Avaya Cloud Office, Avaya Spaces, and Avaya UCaaS.

==Patents==
Avaya has over 4,400 patents and patents pending. In January 2021, the company disclosed it had received its 600th patent for Contact Center technologies, which was granted for AI in &quot;chatbot socialization.&quot;

<doc id="307462" wikidata="Q4305784" url="?curid=307462" title="Mudhif">
<text>A Mudhif ( &quot;al-muḍīf&quot;) is a traditional reed house made by the Ahwari people (also known as Marsh Arabs) in the swamps of southern Iraq. In the traditional Ahwari way of living, houses are constructed from reeds harvested from the marshes where they live. A mudhif is a large ceremonial house, paid for and maintained by a local sheik, for use by guests or as a gathering place for weddings, funerals, etc.

==Description==
Mudhif structures have been one of the traditional types of structures built by the Arabs of the marshlands in southern Iraq for at least 5,000 years. A carved elevation of a typical mudhif, dating to around 3,300 BCE was discovered at Uruk, and is now in the British Museum.

A mudhif is a special type of &quot;sarifa&quot;; a structure made from reeds which grow naturally in the marshlands and is used by the village sheik as a guest-house. Other types of reed dwelling, such as a &quot;raba&quot; (with entrances at both ends and used as a family dwelling) or a &quot;bayt&quot; (strictly a single-room dwelling) are typically smaller than a mudhif and may be used for residential and other purposes.

Each village sheik had a mudhif capable of accommodating at least ten persons. The number of arches used in a mudhif is dictated by the tribe and family group. Sometimes the mudhif was decorated with additional bundles of reeds, arranged in decorative patterns, placed on the façade, to serve as a tribal identifier. The entrance to the mudhif always faces Mecca.
The English writer, Gertrude Bell, wrote a description of a mudhif in a letter to her father:
==Construction==
In the construction of a mudhif, reeds are bundled and woven into thick columns; larger and thicker reeds are bent across and tied to form parabolic arches which make up the building&#x27;s spine. These arches are strengthened by the pre-stressing of the columns, as they are initially inserted into the soil at opposing angles. A series of arches define the building&#x27;s form. Long cross beams of smaller bundled reeds are laid across the arches and tied. Woven mats of reeds form the building envelope. Some of the mats are woven with perforations like a mesh to allow light and ventilation.

The front and back walls are attached to two large vertical bundled reed columns and are also made from woven mats. Mudhif need to be rebuilt every ten years.

===Reeds as a construction material===
The most common type of reed used for the construction of marshland mudhif is &quot;ihdri.&quot; Reed has properties which make it an ideal building material – it has a high concentration of silica which makes it water resistant, unattractive for insects and other pests and an excellent thermal and acoustic insulating material. It is an inexpensive material and it is both flexible and durable as a construction material, which encourages creativity.

==Use==
A mudhif is used as a guest house or for ceremonial occasions, and may not be used for any other purpose. When a guest enters a mudhif, he or she will be welcomed by the village sheik, escorted to their proper place and offered refreshments such as highly sweetened coffee in a ritualised ceremony.

==Recent developments==
In the 1980s, some half a million Arabs lived in the marshes. However, from around 1993, Saddam Hussein began to drain the marshes in an attempt to destroy the life and culture of the southern Arabs. Following Hussein&#x27;s defeat in 2003, Arab communities began to dig up the dykes, re-flooding the marshes and resuming their traditional way of life.

<text>The Andean Community (, CAN) is a free trade area with the objective of creating a customs union comprising the South American countries (Andean states) of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. The trade bloc was called the Andean Pact until 1996 and came into existence when the Cartagena Agreement was signed in 1969. Its headquarters are in Lima, Peru.

The Andean Community has 113 million inhabitants over an area of approximately 3,800,000 km2. Its GDP has gone up to US$745.300 billion in 2005, including Venezuela, which was a member at the time. Its estimated PPP of GDP for 2011 amounts to US$902.86 billion, excluding Venezuela.

==Membership==

The original Andean Pact was founded in 1969 by Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. In 1973 the pact gained its sixth member, Venezuela. In 1976 however, its membership was again reduced to five when Chile withdrew. Venezuela announced its withdrawal in 2006, reducing the Andean Community to four member states.

Recently, with the new cooperation agreement with Mercosur, the Andean Community gained four new associate members: Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. These four Mercosur members were granted associate membership by the Andean Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in an enlarged session with the Commission (of the Andean Community) on 7 July 2005. This moves reciprocates the actions of Mercosur which granted associate membership to all the Andean Community nations by virtue of the Economic Complementarity Agreements (Free Trade agreements) signed between the CAN and individual Mercosur members.

== Relationship with other organizations ==

The Andean Community and Mercosur comprise the two main trading blocs of South America. In 1999, these organizations began negotiating a merger with a view to creating a &quot;South American Free Trade Area&quot; (SAFTA). On 8 December 2004, the Andean Community (CAN) signed a cooperation agreement with Mercosur and they published a joint letter of intention for future negotiations towards integrating all of South America in a Union of South American Nations (USAN), patterned after the European Union.

During 2005, Venezuela decided to join Mercosur. Venezuela&#x27;s official position first appeared to be that, by joining Mercosur, further steps could be taken towards integrating both trade blocs. CAN Secretary General Allan Wagner stated that the Venezuelan Foreign Minister Alí Rodríguez had declared that Venezuela did not intend to leave the CAN, and its simultaneous membership to both blocs marked the beginning of their integration.

However some analysts interpreted that Venezuela might eventually leave the CAN in the process. As Colombia and Peru signed free trade agreements with the United States, in protest the Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez indeed announced in April 2006 his country&#x27;s withdrawal from the CAN, stating that the Community is &quot;dead&quot;. Officials in Colombia and Peru expressed their disagreement with this view, as did representatives from Venezuela&#x27;s industrial sector (Conindustria).

In spite of this announcement, Venezuela still had not formally completed all the necessary withdrawal procedures. According to Venezuela&#x27;s Commerce Minister María Cristina Iglesias, the entire process was going to take up five years. Until then, Venezuela and its partners would remain bound by the effects of the community&#x27;s preexisting commercial agreements.

During a visit to Colombia in August 2007, President Hugo Chávez was asked by the presidents of Ecuador and Bolivia to rejoin the Andean Community, and he responded that he would agree. Meanwhile, at that time the Mercosur&#x27;s relations with Venezuela were weakening as Mercosur was not agreeing with some of the Hugo Chávez&#x27;s proposals.

Eventually Venezuela achieved the full membership of the Mercosur in 2012, making the Mercosur bigger in number of members than the CAN for the first time.

In addition to CAN, Bolivia is also a member of the WTO, UNASUR, and ALBA. Its attitude is considered crucial to relations between UNASUR and ALBA specifically, says Marion Hörmann, since Bolivia is traditionally seen as a mediator between the Andean countries and the rest of South America.

Furthermore, on 7 December 2012, the Bolivian nation was accepted by the Mercosur countries to start the incorporation protocols to achieve the Mercosur full membership in a matter of 4 years, receiving the proclamation of an &quot;accessing member&quot;, and further consolidating itself as a strategic geopolitical nation.

==Free flow of people==
Since 1 January 2005, the citizens of the member countries can enter the other Andean Community member states without the requirement of a visa. Travellers should present the authorities their national ID cards.

Visitors to Venezuela will have to present their passports; they will then receive the Andean Migration Card (&quot;Tarjeta Andina de Migración&quot;), in which the time of temporary residence in the country is stated.

===Andean passport===

The Andean passport was created in June 2001 pursuant to &quot;Decisión 504&quot;. This stipulates the issuing of a passport based on a standard model which contains harmonised features of nomenclature and security. The passport is effective in Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela and Bolivia (Bolivia since early 2006).

<doc id="307467" wikidata="Q737207" url="?curid=307467" title="RealVideo">
<text>RealVideo, also spelled as Real Video, is a suite of proprietary video compression formats developed by RealNetworks — the specific format changes with the version. It was first released in 1997 and was at version 15. RealVideo is supported on many platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris, and several mobile phones.

RealVideo is usually paired with RealAudio and packaged in a RealMedia (.rm) container. RealMedia is suitable for use as a streaming media format, that one is viewed while it is being sent over the network. Streaming video can be used to watch live television since it does not require downloading the entire video in advance.

==Technology==
The first version of RealVideo was announced in 1997 and was based on the H.263 format. At the time, RealNetworks issued a press release saying they had licensed Iterated Systems&#x27; ClearVideo technology and were including it as the RealVideo Fractal Codec. However, support for ClearVideo quietly disappeared in the next version of RealVideo.

RealVideo continued to use H.263 until RealVideo 8 when the company switched to a proprietary video format. RealVideo codecs are identified by four-character codes. RV10 and RV20 are the H.263-based codecs. RV30 and RV40 are RealNetworks&#x27; proprietary H.264-based codecs. These identifiers have been the source of some confusion, as people may assume that RV10 is RealVideo version 10 when it is the first version of RealVideo. RealVideo 10 uses RV40.

RealVideo can be played from a RealMedia file or streamed over the network using the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP), a standard protocol for streaming media developed by the IETF. However, RealNetworks uses RTSP only to set up and manage the connection. The actual video data is sent with their own proprietary Real Data Transport (RDT) protocol. This tactic has drawn criticism because it made it difficult to use RealVideo with other player and server software. However, the open-source MPlayer project has now developed software capable of playing the RDT streams.

To facilitate real-time streaming, RealVideo (and RealAudio) normally uses constant bit rate encoding, so that the same amount of data is sent over the network each second. Recently, RealNetworks has introduced a variable bit rate form called RealMedia Variable Bitrate (RMVB). This allows for better video quality, however, this format is less suited for streaming because it is difficult to predict how much network capacity a certain video stream will need. Video with fast motion or rapidly changing scenes will require a higher bit rate. If the bit rate of a video stream increases significantly, it may exceed the speed at which data can be transmitted over the network, leading to an interruption in the video.

RealNetworks says that the RealVideo and RealAudio codecs are not available in source code under the RPSL license. Source code is available only under RCSL license for commercial porting to non-supported processors and operating systems. While RealNetworks owns most of the intellectual property for RealVideo and RealAudio, RealNetworks has licensed third-party technology for certain aspects of those codecs. RealNetworks claims that it does not have the right to license that technology under an open-source license.

==RealVideo Players==

The official player for RealVideo is RealNetworks RealPlayer SP, currently at version 15, and is available for various platforms including Windows, Macintosh, and Linux. Several other players exist, including MPlayer and Media Player Classic. Many of these rely on the dynamically linked libraries (DLLs) from the official RealPlayer to play the video, and thus require RealPlayer to be installed (or at least its DLLs, if not the actual player). However, FFmpeg&#x27;s libav* libraries (and its DirectShow counterpart ffdshow) can play RealVideo and do not require RealPlayer or any parts thereof.

The latest version of RealPlayer that can run on Windows 9x is RealPlayer 8; but this version can be easily modified to play RealPlayer 9 and 10 files, by the manual addition of just three .dll files (codecs and plugins), from Microsoft&#x27;s free distribution of RealPlayer 10, that are not included in RealPlayer 8 Basic.

RealNetworks has also developed the open-source Helix player, however support for RealVideo in the Helix Project is limited because RealNetworks is still keeping the codecs proprietary.

RealPlayer does not record RealVideo streams, and RealNetworks has advertised this feature to content owners such as broadcasters, film studios, and music labels, as a means of discouraging users from copying video. However, other software exists which can save the streams to files for later viewing. Such copying, known as time-shifting, is legal in most countries.

==Video compression formats and codec versions==
RealVideo files are compressed using several different video compression formats. Each video compression format is identified by a four-character code. Below is a list of the video compression formats and the version in which each was introduced:

===RV10===
* , : RealVideo 1.0, based on H.263 (included with RealPlayer 5)

===RV20===
* : RealVideo G2 and RealVideo G2+SVT, also based on h.263 (included with RealPlayer 6). SVT (Scalable Video Technology) is a feature that allows for decoding at a lower framerate (frame-skipping) on low-end machines.

===RV30===

* : RealVideo 8, suspected to be based largely on an early draft of H.264 (included with RealPlayer 8)

===RV40===

* : RealVideo 9, suspected to be based on H.264 (included with RealPlayer 9)
* : RealVideo 10, aka RV9 EHQ (included with RealPlayer 10). This refers to an improved encoder for the RV9 format that is fully backward compatible with RV9 players – the format and decoder did not change, only the encoder did. As a result, it uses the same FourCC.

===RV60===
* : RealMedia HD (RealVideo 11), suspected to be based on HEVC (included with RealPlayer 18). In April 2018, RealNetworks posted test results of encoder speed and compression efficiency. Their tests compared RealMedia HD to HEVC, H.264, and VP9 encoders. Results claimed RealMedia HD provided higher compression than HEVC at higher perceived quality levels. RealMedia HD was also purportedly faster than x265 and VP9 at comparable complexity settings.

The newest version of RealPlayer can play any RealVideo file, as can programs using FFmpeg. Other programs may not support all video compression formats. In addition to decoder code for up to RV50, FFmpeg also contains open-source code for RV10 and RV20 encoders.

<doc id="307469" wikidata="Q47591" url="?curid=307469" title="Byzantine architecture">
<text>Byzantine architecture is the architecture of the Byzantine Empire, or Eastern Roman Empire, usually dated from 330 AD, when Constantine the Great established a new Roman capital in Byzantium, which became Constantinople, until the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453. There was initially no hard line between the Byzantine and Roman Empires, and early Byzantine architecture is stylistically and structurally indistinguishable from late Roman architecture. The style continued to be based on arches, vaults and domes, often on a large scale. Wall mosaics with gold backgrounds became standard for the grandest buildings, with frescos a cheaper alternative.

The richest interiors were finished with thin plates of marble or coloured and patterned stone. Some of the columns were also made of marble. Other widely used materials were bricks and stone. Mosaics made of stone or glass tesserae were also elements of interior architecture. Precious wood furniture, like beds, chairs, stools, tables, bookshelves and silver or golden cups with beautiful reliefs, decorated Byzantine interiors.

Early Byzantine architecture drew upon earlier elements of Roman and Greek architecture. Stylistic drift, technological advancement, and political and territorial changes meant that a distinct style gradually resulted in the Greek cross plan in church architecture. Civil architecture continued Greco-Roman trends; the Byzantines built impressive fortifications and bridges, but generally not aqueducts on the same scales as the Romans.

This terminology was introduced by modern historians to designate the medieval Roman Empire as it evolved as a distinct artistic and cultural entity centered on the new capital of Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) rather than the city of Rome and its environs. Its architecture dramatically influenced the later medieval architecture throughout Europe and the Near East.

==Characteristics==


When the Roman Empire became Christian (after having extended eastwards) with its new capital at Constantinople, its architecture became more sensuous and ambitious. This new style with exotic domes and richer mosaics would come to be known as &quot;Byzantine&quot; before it traveled west to Ravenna and Venice and as far north as Moscow. Most of the churches and basilicas have high-riding domes, which created vast open spaces at the centers of churches, thereby heightening the light. The round arch is a fundamental of Byzantine style. Magnificent golden mosaics with their graphic simplicity brought light and warmth into the heart of churches. Byzantine capitals break away from the Classical conventions of ancient Greece and Rome with sinuous lines and naturalistic forms, which are precursors to the Gothic style.

In the same way the Parthenon is the most impressive monument for Classical religion, Hagia Sophia remained the iconic church for Christianity. The temples of these two religions differ substantially from the point of view of their interiors and exteriors. For Classical temples, only the exterior was important, because only the priests entered the interior, where the statue of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated was kept. The ceremonies were held outside, in front of the temple. Instead, Christian liturgies were held inside the churches.

==Columns==
Byzantine columns are quite varied, mostly developing from the classical Corinthian, with the ornamentation undercut with drills, and fluted shafts almost entirely abandoned. The block of stone was left rough as it came from the quarry, and the sculptor evolved new designs to his own fancy, so that one rarely meets with many repetitions of the same design. One of the most remarkable designs features leaves carved as if blown by the wind; the finest example being at the 7th-century Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki). Those in the Cathedral of Saint Mark, Venice (1071) specially attracted John Ruskin&#x27;s fancy. Others appear in Sant&#x27;Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna (549).

The column in San Vitale, Ravenna (547) shows above it the dosseret required to carry the arch, the springing of which was much wider than the abacus of the column. On eastern columns the eagle, the lion and the lamb are occasionally carved, but treated conventionally.

There are two types of columns used at Hagia Sophia: Composite and Ionic. The Composite column that emerged during the Late Byzantine Empire, mainly in Rome, combines the Corinthian with the Ionic. Composite columns line the principal space of the nave. Ionic columns are used behind them in the side spaces, in a mirror position relative to the Corinthian or Composite orders (as was their fate well into the 19th century, when buildings were designed for the first time with a monumental Ionic order). At Hagia Sophia, though, these are not the standard imperial statements. The columns are filled with foliage in all sorts of variations. In some, the small, lush leaves appear to be caught up in the spinning of the scrolls – clearly, a different, nonclassical sensibility has taken over the design.

The columns at Basilica of San Vitale show wavy and delicate floral patterns similar to decorations found on belt buckles and dagger blades. Their inverted pyramidal form has the look of a basket.

==Overview of extant monuments==
Buildings increased in geometric complexity, brick and plaster were used in addition to stone in the decoration of important public structures, classical orders were used more freely, mosaics replaced carved decoration, complex domes rested upon massive piers, and windows filtered light through thin sheets of alabaster to softly illuminate interiors. Most of the surviving structures are sacred, with secular buildings having been destroyed.

===Early architecture===

Prime examples of early Byzantine architecture date from the Emperor Justinian I&#x27;s reign and survive in Ravenna and Istanbul, as well as in Sofia (the Church of St Sophia). One of the great breakthroughs in the history of Western architecture occurred when Justinian&#x27;s architects invented a complex system providing for a smooth transition from a square plan of the church to a circular dome (or domes) by means of pendentives.

In Ravenna, the longitudinal basilica of Sant&#x27;Apollinare Nuovo, and the octagonal, centralized structure of the church of San Vitale, commissioned by Emperor Justinian but never seen by him, was built. Justinian&#x27;s monuments in Istanbul include the domed churches of Hagia Sophia and Hagia Irene(both discussed in more detail below), but there is also an earlier, smaller church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (locally referred to as &quot;Little Hagia Sophia&quot;), which might have served as a model for both in that it combined the elements of a longitudinal basilica with those of a centralized building.

Other structures include the ruins of the Great Palace of Constantinople, the innovative walls of Constantinople (with 192 towers) and Basilica Cistern (with hundreds of recycled classical columns). A mosaic in the church begun by the Ostrogoths, San Apollinare in Nuovo in Ravenna, depicts an early Byzantine palace.

Hagios Demetrios in Thessaloniki, Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on Mount Sinai, Jvari Monastery in present-day Georgia, and three Armenian churches of Echmiadzin all date primarily from the 7th century and provide a glimpse on architectural developments in the Byzantine provinces following the age of Justinian.

Remarkable engineering feats include the 430 m long Sangarius Bridge, the pointed arch of Karamagara Bridge, as well as the dome of the Church of Hagia Sophia.

=== Middle Byzantine architecture ===
In the Macedonian dynasty, it is presumed that Basil I&#x27;s votive church of the Theotokos of the Pharos and the &quot;Nea Ekklesia&quot; (both no longer existent) served as a model for most cross-in-square sanctuaries of the period, including the Cattolica di Stilo in southern Italy (9th century), the monastery church of Hosios Lukas in Greece (c. 1000), Nea Moni of Chios (a pet project of Constantine IX), and the Daphni Monastery near Athens (c. 1050). All three of the later churches display the important shifts in architectural design that occurred following the end of Iconoclasm, when architectural design and decoration became more standardized.

The Hagia Sophia church in Ochrid (present-day North Macedonia), built in the First Bulgarian Empire in the time of Boris I of Bulgaria, and eponymous cathedral in Kiev (present-day Ukraine) testify to a vogue for multiple subsidiary domes set on drums, which would gain in height and narrowness with the progress of time.

==== Comnenian and Paleologan periods ====
In Istanbul and Asia Minor the architecture of the Komnenian period is almost non-existent, with the notable exceptions of the Elmali Kilise and other rock sanctuaries of Cappadocia, and of the Churches of the Pantokrator and of the Theotokos Kyriotissa in Istanbul. Most examples of this architectural style and many of the other older Byzantine styles only survive on the outskirts of the Byzantine world, as most significant and ancient churches and buildings were in Asia Minor. During World War I, almost all churches that ended up within the Turkish borders were destroyed or converted into mosques. Some were abandoned as a result of the Greek and Christian genocides from 1915 to 1923. Similar styles can be found in countries such as Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Russia, Serbia and other Slavic lands, as well as in Sicily (Cappella Palatina) and Veneto (St Mark&#x27;s Basilica, Torcello Cathedral).

In Middle Byzantine architecture &quot;cloisonné masonry&quot; refers to walls built with a regular mix of stone and brick, often with more of the latter. The exterior of the 11th- or 12th-century Pammakaristos Church in Istanbul is an example, though it is even more renowned for Late Byzantine additions discussed below.

=== Late Byzantine architecture ===
The Paleologan period is well represented in a dozen former churches in Istanbul, notably St Saviour at Chora and St Mary Pammakaristos. Unlike their Slavic counterparts, the Paleologan architects never accented the vertical thrust of structures. As a result, the late medieval architecture of Byzantium (barring the Hagia Sophia of Trebizond) is less prominent in height.

The Church of the Holy Apostles (Thessaloniki) is cited as an archetypal structure of the late period with its exterior walls intricately decorated with complex brickwork patterns or with glazed ceramics. Other churches from the years immediately predating the fall of Constantinople survive on Mount Athos and in Mistra (e.g. Brontochion Monastery). That site also has preserved secular architecture such as the Palace of the Despots and several houses. 

In the late Byzantine period, c. 1310, a highly ornate parekklesion was added to the Pammakaristos Church in Constantinople for the tomb of Michael Glabas Tarchaniotes, a Byzantine aristocrat and general who lived c. 1235 to c. 1305–08. It displays the attenuated proportions favored in the late Byzantine era, as well as shifts in style in the mosaics&#x27; treatment of figures.

==Structural evolution==

As early as the building of Constantine&#x27;s churches in Palestine there were two chief types of plan in use: the basilican, or axial, type, represented by the basilica at the Holy Sepulchre, and the circular, or central, type, represented by the great octagonal church once at Antioch. 

Those of the latter type we must suppose were nearly always vaulted, for a central dome would seem to furnish their very purpose. The central space was sometimes surrounded by a very thick wall, in which deep recesses, to the interior, were formed, as at Church of St. George, Sofia, built by the Romans in the 4th century as a cylindrical domed structure built on a square base, and the noble Church of Saint George, Thessaloniki (5th century), or by a vaulted aisle, as at Santa Costanza, Rome (4th century); or annexes were thrown out from the central space in such a way as to form a cross, in which these additions helped to counterpoise the central vault, as at the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, Ravenna (5th century). The most famous church of this type was that of the Holy Apostles, Constantinople. Vaults appear to have been early applied to the basilican type of plan; for instance, at Hagia Irene, Constantinople (6th century), the long body of the church is covered by two domes.

At Saint Sergius, Constantinople, and San Vitale, Ravenna, churches of the central type, the space under the dome was enlarged by having apsidal additions made to the octagon. Finally, at Hagia Sophia (6th century) a combination was made which is perhaps the most remarkable piece of planning ever contrived. A central space of 100 ft (30 m) square is increased to 200 ft (60 m) in length by adding two hemicycles to it to the east and the west; these are again extended by pushing out three minor apses eastward, and two others, one on either side of a straight extension, to the west. This unbroken area, about 260 ft (80 m) long, the larger part of which is over 100 ft (30 m) wide, is entirely covered by a system of domical surfaces. Above the conchs of the small apses rise the two great semi-domes which cover the hemicycles, and between these bursts out the vast dome over the central square. On the two sides, to the north and south of the dome, it is supported by vaulted aisles in two stories which bring the exterior form to a general square.

At the Holy Apostles (6th century) five domes were applied to a cruciform plan; the central dome was the highest. After the 6th century there were no churches built which in any way competed in scale with these great works of Justinian, and the plans more or less tended to approximate to one type. The central area covered by the dome was included in a considerably larger square, of which the four divisions, to the east, west, north and south, were carried up higher in the vaulting and roof system than the four corners, forming in this way a sort of nave and transepts. Sometimes the central space was square, sometimes octagonal, or at least there were eight piers supporting the dome instead of four, and the nave and transepts were narrower in proportion.

If we draw a square and divide each side into three so that the middle parts are greater than the others, and then divide the area into nine from these points, we approximate to the typical setting out of a plan of this time. Now add three apses on the east side opening from the three divisions, and opposite to the west put a narrow entrance porch running right across the front. Still in front put a square court. The court is the atrium and usually has a fountain in the middle under a canopy resting on pillars. The entrance porch is the &quot;narthex&quot;. Directly under the center of the dome is the &quot;ambo&quot;, from which the Scriptures were proclaimed, and beneath the ambo at floor level was the place for the choir of singers. Across the eastern side of the central square was a screen which divided off the &quot;bema&quot;, where the altar was situated, from the body of the church; this screen, bearing images, is the &quot;iconostasis&quot;. The altar was protected by a canopy or &quot;ciborium&quot; resting on pillars. Rows of rising seats around the curve of the apse with the patriarch&#x27;s throne at the middle eastern point formed the synthronon. The two smaller compartments and apses at the sides of the bema were sacristies, the &quot;diaconicon&quot; and &quot;prothesis&quot;. The ambo and bema were connected by the &quot;solea&quot;, a raised walkway enclosed by a railing or low wall.

The continuous influence from the East is widely shown in the fashion of decorating external brick walls of churches built about the 12th century, in which bricks roughly carved into form are set up so as to make bands of ornamentation which it is quite clear are imitated from Cufic writing. This fashion was associated with the disposition of the exterior brick and stone work generally into many varieties of pattern, zig-zags, key-patterns etc.; and, as similar decoration is found in many Persian buildings, it is probable that this custom also was derived from the East. The domes and vaults to the exterior were covered with lead or with tiling of regional variety. The window and door frames were of marble. The interior surfaces were adorned all over by mosaics or frescoes in the higher parts of the edifice, and below with incrustations of marble slabs, which were frequently of very beautiful varieties, and disposed so that, although in one surface, the coloring formed a series of large panels. The better marbles were opened out so that the two surfaces produced by the division formed a symmetrical pattern.

== Legacy ==
===In the West===
Ultimately, Byzantine architecture in the West gave way to Carolingian, Romanesque, and Gothic architecture. But a great part of current Italy used to belong to the Byzantine Empire before that. Great examples of Byzantine architecture are still visible in Ravenna (for example Basilica di San Vitale which architecture influenced the Palatine Chapel of Charlemagne).

===In the East===

As for the East, Byzantine architectural tradition exerted a profound influence on early Islamic architecture, particularly Umayyad architecture. During the Umayyad Caliphate era (661-750), as far as the Byzantine impact on early Islamic architecture is concerned, the Byzantine arts formed a fundamental source to the new Muslim artistic heritage, especially in Syria. There are considerable Byzantine influences which can be detected in the distinctive early Islamic monuments in Syria (709–715). While these give clear reference in plan - and somewhat in decoration - to Byzantine art, the plan of the Umayyad Mosque has also a remarkable similarity with 6th- and 7th-century Christian basilicas, but it has been modified and expanded on the transversal axis and not on the normal longitudinal axis as in the Christian basilicas. The tile work, geometric patterns, multiple arches, domes, and polychrome brick and stone work that characterize Muslim and Moorish architecture were influenced heavily by Byzantine architecture.

===Post-Byzantine architecture in Eastern Orthodox countries===

In Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Serbia, Romania, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Ukraine, Russia and other Orthodox countries the Byzantine architecture persisted even longer, from the 16th up to the 18th centuries, giving birth to local post-Byzantine schools of architecture.

* In Medieval Bulgaria: The Preslav and Tarnovo architectural schools.
* In Medieval Serbia: Raška architectural school, Vardar architectural school and Morava architectural school.

===Neo-Byzantine architecture===

Neo-Byzantine architecture was followed in the wake of the 19th-century Gothic revival, resulting in such jewels as Westminster Cathedral in London, and in Bristol from about 1850 to 1880 a related style known as Bristol Byzantine was popular for industrial buildings which combined elements of the Byzantine style with Moorish architecture. It was developed on a wide-scale basis in Russia during the reign of Alexander II by Grigory Gagarin and his followers who designed St Volodymyr&#x27;s Cathedral in Kyiv, St Nicholas Naval Cathedral in Kronstadt, Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia, Saint Mark&#x27;s church in Belgrade and the New Athos Monastery in New Athos near Sukhumi. The largest Neo-Byzantine project of the 20th century was the Church of Saint Sava in Belgrade.

== Important Byzantine monuments ==

=== Hagia Irene ===

One of the less famous Byzantine churches is Hagia Irene. This church served as a model church for the more famous church, Hagia Sophia. Construction on the church began in the 4th century. This was the first church that was built in Constantinople, but due to its location, it was severely damaged by earthquakes and the Nika riots, and required repair several times. The Hagia Irene is defined by its large atrium, and is in fact the only surviving building of the Byzantine Empire to have such a feature.

==== Construction ====
Hagia Irene is composed mainly of three materials: stone, brick, and mortar. Bricks 70 cm x 35 cm x 5 cm were used, and these bricks were glued together using mortar approximately 5 cm thick. The building materials chosen for the construction of the church had to be lightweight, durable, and strong. Volcanic materials were chosen for this purpose, as volcanic concrete is very light and durable. Perhaps the most definite feature of the Hagia Irene is the strict contrast between the interior and exterior design. While the plain outside composed of stone and brick favors functionality, the interior is decorated in elaborate mosaics, decorative marble, and, in some places, covered in plaster. Another important characteristic of the church include two domes that follow one behind another, the first being a lower oval, and the second being a higher semi-circle.

==== History of Hagia Irene ====
Throughout history Hagia Irene has undergone several changes. There were multiple repairs due to the Nika riots and earthquakes. When the Ottomans took over Hagia Irene they repurposed it and made a few changes, but none as drastic as what was done to Hagia Sophia. Today, Hagia Irene is still standing and open to visitors as a museum. It is open everyday, except for Tuesdays.

Construction of Hagia Irene
=== Hagia Sophia ===
The most famous example of Byzantine architecture is the Hagia Sophia, and it has been described as &quot;holding a unique position in the Christian world&quot;, and as an architectural and cultural icon of Byzantine and Eastern Orthodox civilization. The Hagia Sophia held the title of largest church in the world until the Ottoman Empire sieged the Byzantine capital. After the fall of Constantinople, the church was used by the Muslims for their religious services until 1931, when it was reopened as a museum in 1935. Translated from Greek, the name Hagia Sophia means &quot;Holy Wisdom&quot;.

==== Construction of Hagia Sophia ====

The construction is a combination of longitudinal and central structures. This church was a part of a larger complex of buildings created by Emperor Justinian. This style influenced the construction of several other buildings, such as St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Hagia Sophia should have been built to withstand earthquakes, but since the construction of Hagia Sophia was rushed this technology was not implemented in the design, which is why the building has had to be repaired so many times due to damages from the earthquakes. The dome is the key feature of Hagia Sophia as the domed basilica is representative of Byzantine architecture. Both of the domes collapsed at different times throughout history due to earthquakes and had to be rebuilt.

==== History of Hagia Sophia ====
The original construction of Hagia Sophia was possibly ordered by Constantine, but ultimately carried out by his son Constantius II in 360. Constantine&#x27;s building of churches, specifically the Hagia Sophia, was considered an incredibly significant component in his shift of the centralization of power from Rome in the west to Constantinople in the east, and was considered the high-point of religious and political celebration. The construction of the final version of the Hagia Sophia, which still stands today, was overseen by Emperor Justinian. Between the rule of these two Emperors, Hagia Sophia was destroyed and rebuilt twice. Following its reconstruction, Hagia Sophia was considered the center of Orthodox Christianity for 900 years, until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans.

<text>Henri Gouraud (born 1944) is a French computer scientist. He is the inventor of Gouraud shading used in computer graphics. He is the great-nephew of general Henri Gouraud.

During 1964–1967, he studied at École Centrale Paris. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Utah College of Engineering in 1971, working with Dave Evans and Ivan Sutherland, with his dissertation titled &quot;Computer Display of Curved Surfaces&quot;.

In 1971, Gouraud made the first computer graphics geometry capture and representation of a human face in wire-frame model, and applied his shader to produce the famous human face images showing the effect of his shading, which were done using his wife Sylvie Gouraud as the model.

<doc id="307481" wikidata="Q1852517" url="?curid=307481" title="Dan Bern">
<text>Dan Bern (also known as Bernstein; born July 27, 1965) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, novelist, and painter. His music has been compared to that of Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, Bruce Springsteen, Phil Ochs and Elvis Costello.

He is a prolific composer, having written over one thousand songs. He wrote the novel &quot;Quitting Science&quot; (2004) under the pen name Cunliffe Merriwether and wrote the preface under his own name.

Bern describes his music as &quot;[u]ndefinable by genre, crossing over and through folk, rock, singer-songwriter, and kids music&quot; with sardonic, literary lyrics. He has toured with Ani DiFranco, The Who, and Roger Daltrey.

==Early life and education==
Dan Bern was born in Mount Vernon, Iowa.
He is of Lithuanian Jewish ancestry ; on a trip to Lithuania, he learned Bernstein was his family&#x27;s name before immigration to the United States.

Bern learned to play cello at age six, and the guitar at 14 or 16, after he heard his first Bob Dylan songs.

After college, he played seven open mics a week in Chicago and started to be invited to Chicago folk clubs such as The Earl of Old Town, Holstein&#x27;s and The No Exit.

==Career and themes==

Between 1997 and 2003, many of his tours and recordings featured a regular cast of backup musicians which he began calling the International Jewish Banking Conspiracy or IJBC, which Bern said was a tribute to the book &quot;Nigger&quot; by Dick Gregory.

Although a vein of social and political humor runs through even his earliest work, Bern&#x27;s songs became more explicitly political during the 2004 US presidential election campaign, with songs such as &quot;Bush Must Be Defeated&quot; and &quot;President&quot; highlighting his sometimes surreal political takes. His work often deals with his Lithuanian Jewish ancestry, as in songs like &quot;Lithuania.&quot; The name Bernstein is a reference to this ancestry; on a trip to Lithuania, he learned it was his family&#x27;s name before immigration to the United States. In 2004, Bern published the novel &quot;Quitting Science&quot; and, in 2012, &quot;Cleaver the Gronk&quot; under the pen name Cunliffe Merriwether.

&quot;New American Language&quot;, &quot;The Swastika EP&quot;, &quot;Fleeting Days&quot; and &quot;My Country II&quot; were all released under the &quot;Dan Bern &amp; the International Jewish Banking Conspiracy&quot; name. The IJBC featured longtime Bern producer and collaborator Wil Masisak on keyboards, drums, guitar, and bass; Eben &quot;Eby Brown&quot; Grace on guitar and pedal steel; Brian &quot;Slim Nickel&quot; Schey on bass and guitar; Paul Kuhn on cellocaster; Anna Phoebe on electric violin; and drummers Colin &quot;Spanky&quot; Mahoney and Jake Coffin.

In early 2007, Bern&#x27;s &quot;Breathe&quot; won in The 6th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Folk/Singer-Songwriter Album.

Bern&#x27;s songwriting skills were used in the 2007 biopic parody film &quot;Walk Hard&quot; where he helped write 16 songs for the movie. Many of these songs made the theatrical cut of the film including the Dylanesque &quot;Royal Jelly,&quot; and the melodic &quot;(Have You Heard the News) Dewey Cox Died.&quot; He continues to write songs for films, including &quot;Get Him to the Greek&quot; and &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot;. 

In 2009, 2010, and 2012, Bern played with &quot;Common Rotation&quot; from Los Angeles, California which consists of vocals, guitar, banjo, trumpet, saxophone, and other instruments. Their concert in September 2009 at the M Bar in Los Angeles, was released as a live album in the spring of 2010 called &quot;Live in Los Angeles&quot; with about half the songs Bern playing solo and the other half including Common Rotation.

Bern&#x27;s song &quot;One Dance&quot; was also included in Kasdan&#x27;s first film, &quot;Zero Effect&quot;. Bern wrote &quot;Swing Set,&quot; a duet with Emmylou Harris, for the off Broadway production of &quot;Family Week&quot; (directed by Jonathan Demme), and wrote the title song for Demme&#x27;s documentary &quot;Jimmy Carter: Man From Plains&quot;.

In 2012, Bern released two studio recordings of American roots music: &quot;Drifter,&quot; featuring a duet with Emmylou Harris, and &quot;Doubleheader,&quot; an 18-song tribute to baseball culled from close to 30 years of songwriting and recorded at Bob Weir&#x27;s TRI Studios in Marin County. &quot;Doubleheader&quot; features the song &quot;Johnny Sylvester Comes Back to Visit the Babe&quot;, in which he put words and music to the story of Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester. 

Bern has created two podcasts: &quot;10,000 Crappy Songs: A Musical Detective Story&quot;, a fictional radio drama featuring original music from Bern; and &quot;Hunkered in the Bunker&quot;, a series of free-form shows produced during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also produces an internet radio station, &quot;Radio Free Bernsteinn.&quot;

In 2020, Bern created the song &quot;Never-To-Be-Forgotten Kinda Year&quot; to soundtrack Reddit&#x27;s 2020 &quot;Year in Review&quot; video.
===Influence===
Bern&#x27;s song &quot;Talkin&#x27; Woody, Bob, Bruce, and Dan Blues,&quot; from the album &quot;Smartie Mine&quot;, offers a joking take on the influence of Dylan and Guthrie, presented in the style of a Guthrie or Dylan talking blues song, and containing a spoof of a Springsteen song as well. When asked about the similarity between himself and Dylan, he once quipped, &quot;I guess Bob Dylan was sort of the Dan Bern of the &#x27;60&#x27;s.&quot; 

==Personal life==

In 1991, he lived in Hollywood, taught tennis in Encino to make a living as a songwriter. The junior scouts from the major record companies “were coming around&quot;.
Bern is married to Danielle Lesniewski. They have a daughter, Lulu, who Bern listed as a collaborator and later the lead artist on several of his children&#x27;s albums. The family lived in Los Angeles until 2016 before moving eastward for family reasons. They now reside in New Mexico. 

An avid fan of sports and baseball in particular, Bern has written and recorded a number of sports-focused albums and songs, such as the tennis-centered &quot;Jack Kramer Wood Racket&quot; and the baseball albums &quot;Doubleheader, Rivalry,&quot; and &quot;Elly De La Cruz &amp; Other Stories&quot;, the latter of which was created &quot;especially for Reds fans.&quot; Bern also listens to the sports podcast The Tony Kornheiser Show &quot;religiously&quot; and began submitting his sports songs for the show to use on-air. After running through his existing library, he began writing songs specifically for the show; these are compiled in his &quot;Songs for Mr. Tony&quot; records.

<text>The Borough of Waverley is a local government district with borough status in Surrey, England. The borough contains the towns of Godalming, Farnham and Haslemere, as well as numerous villages, including the large village of Cranleigh, and surrounding rural areas. At the 2021 Census, the population of the borough was 128,200. The borough is named after Waverley Abbey, near Farnham. Large parts of the borough are within the Surrey Hills National Landscape. Its council, Waverley Borough Council, is based in Godalming.

The neighbouring districts are Guildford, Mole Valley, Horsham, Chichester, East Hampshire, Hart and Rushmoor.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered the area of four former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Farnham Urban District
*Godalming Municipal Borough
*Haslemere Urban District
*Hambledon Rural District
The new district was named after Waverley Abbey in the parish of Farnham, which was the earliest Cistercian monastery in Britain.

For the first six years of its existence, the council was based outside the district at the former Hambledon Rural District Council&#x27;s offices at Bury Fields in Guildford. In April 1980, the council moved to purpose-built headquarters at The Burys in Godalming, behind Godalming Borough Hall. The district was awarded borough status on 21 February 1984, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==

Waverley Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Surrey County Council. The whole borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

The council has shared a chief executive with neighbouring Guildford Borough Council since 2017.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2019, being run by a coalition of the Liberal Democrats, Farnham Residents, Labour and Greens. The same coalition continues to run the council following the 2023 election.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Waverley. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2003 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:
The Labour and Green councillors sit together as a group. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 50 councillors representing 24 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

==Geography==
Waverley&#x27;s landscape is influenced by its position within the landform of the Weald. It contains parts of the North Downs and the Greensand Ridge and large parts of the borough are within the Surrey Hills AONB. It has the most green space in absolute terms in Surrey at according to the central government-compiled Generalised Land Use database of January 2005, approximately half of which is woodland.

Blackheath Common, in the north of the borough, is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, as is the Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl in the south of the district.

==Demography==
A Legatum Prosperity Index published by the Legatum Institute in October 2016 showed Waverley as the most prosperous council area in the United Kingdom.

==Twinning==
* Mayen-Koblenz in Germany dates from 1977.

<text>Nufărul is a large &quot;satellite&quot; quarter (&quot;cartier&quot; in Romanian) on the eastern outskirts of Oradea, Bihor County, Romania. Like all other &quot;quarters&quot; of Oradea, Nufărul does not have an official boundary, nor does it have a local government (being governed by the Municipality of Oradea).

The name Nufărul means &quot;water lily&quot; in Romanian. The name for the quarter came from the fact, that, in this area, there are many water lilies, the area extending up until Băile Felix, the thermal resort, where there are beautiful lakes with water lilies.

==Infrastructure and services==
Nufărul is termed a &quot;satellite&quot; quarter because it is located at the edge of the Oradea municipality and contains a range of infrastructure similar to Oradea city centre, including a transport hub, supermarkets and other commercial infrastructure, and high-density apartment blocks.

After the Oradea city centre (&quot;Centru&quot;) and Rogerius, it is the third-largest district for business in Oradea. It is also one of the fastest-growing areas in Bihor county in terms of development and foreign investment, due to its location on the E60 Budapest–Bucharest highway, the quarter being the first point of contact with Oradea when arriving from Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, and other major Romanian cities.

A piece of trivia used as a sign of Nufărul&#x27;s rise as an important centre for foreign investment is that the quarter was the location of the second McDonald&#x27;s (McDrive) restaurant in the Municipality of Oradea.

However, despite having a wide range of infrastructure, Nufărul was, like Rogerius, built-up mainly during Romania&#x27;s Communist period, which ended as a result of the Romanian Revolution of 1989. For that reason, the quarter is said by many to lack the historical charm of central Oradea, instead being filled by planned and mostly unaesthetic Communist-era apartment blocks and buildings.

==Transport==
Nufărul is an important transport hub for the Oradea Transport Local network. The quarter is accessible by tram and bus from the city centre, and is a terminus for one of the city&#x27;s three tram lines, as well as various bus lines. It is also the gateway to Băile Felix, a well-known spa resort outside Oradea, with several shuttle bus connections to the resort.</text><links>
