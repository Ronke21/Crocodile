<text>Christopher Ifekandu Okigbo (16 August 1932 – 1967) was a Nigerian poet, teacher, and librarian, who died fighting for the independence of Biafra. He is today widely acknowledged as an outstanding postcolonial English-language African poet and one of the major modernist writers of the 20th century.

==Early life==
Okigbo was born on 16 August 1932, in the town of Ojoto, about from the city of Onitsha in Anambra State, located in the southeastern region of Nigeria. His father was a teacher in Catholic missionary schools during the heyday of British colonial rule in Nigeria, and Okigbo spent his early years moving from station to station. 

An influential figure in Okigbo&#x27;s early years was his older brother Pius Okigbo, who would later become the renowned economist and first Nigerian Ambassador to the European Economic Commission (EU). His first cousin was the academic, Bede Okigbo.

== Personal life ==
Despite his father&#x27;s devout Christianity, Okigbo had an affinity, and came to believe later in his life, that in him was reincarnated the soul of his maternal grandfather, a priest of Idoto, an Igbo deity. Idoto is personified in the river of the same name that flows through Okigbo&#x27;s village, and the &quot;water goddess&quot; figures prominently in his work. &quot;Heavensgate&quot; (1962) opens with the lines:

::&quot;Before you, mother Idoto,&quot;
:::&quot;naked I stand,&quot;

while in &quot;Distances&quot; (1964), he celebrates his final aesthetic and psychic return to his indigenous religious roots:

:&quot;I am the sole witness to my homecoming.&quot;

==Days at Umuahia and Ibadan==
Okigbo graduated from Government College Umuahia (in present Abia State, southeastern Nigeria) two years after Chinua Achebe, another noted Nigerian writer, having earned himself a reputation as both a voracious reader and a versatile athlete. The following year, he was accepted to University College in Ibadan (now known as University of Ibadan) in Oyo State, southwestern Nigeria. Originally intending to study Medicine, he switched to Classics in his second year. In college, he also earned a reputation as a gifted pianist, accompanying Wole Soyinka in his first public appearance as a singer. It is believed that Okigbo also wrote original music at that time, though none of this has survived.

==Work and art==
Upon graduating in 1956, he held a succession of jobs in various locations throughout the country, while making his first forays into poetry. He worked at the Nigerian Tobacco Company, United Africa Company, the Fiditi Grammar School (where he taught Latin), and finally as Assistant Librarian at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka, where he helped to found the African Authors Association.

During those years, he began publishing his work in various journals, notably &quot;Black Orpheus&quot;, a literary journal intended to bring together the best works of African and African-American writers. While his poetry can be read in part as powerful expression of postcolonial African nationalism, he was adamantly opposed to Negritude, which he denounced as a romantic pursuit of the &quot;mystique of blackness&quot; for its own sake; he similarly rejected the conception of a commonality of experience between Africans and black Americans, a stark philosophical contrast to the editorial policy of &quot;Black Orpheus&quot;. It was on precisely these grounds that he rejected the first prize in African poetry awarded to him at the 1966 World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar, while declaring that there is no such thing as a Negro or black poet.

In 1963, he left Nsukka to assume the position of West African Representative of Cambridge University Press at Ibadan, a position affording the opportunity to travel frequently to the United Kingdom, where he attracted further attention. At Ibadan, he became an active member of the Mbari literary club, and completed, composed or published the works of his mature years, including &quot;Limits&quot; (1964), &quot;Silences&quot; (1962–65), &quot;Lament of the Masks&quot; (commemorating the centenary of the birth of W. B. Yeats in the forms of a Yoruba praise poem, 1964), &quot;Dance of the Painted Maidens&quot; (commemorating the 1964 birth of his daughter, Obiageli or Ibrahimat, whom he regarded as a reincarnation of his mother) and his final highly prophetic sequence, &quot;Path of Thunder&quot; (1965–67), which was published posthumously in 1971 with his magnum opus, &quot;Labyrinths&quot;, which incorporates the poems from the earlier collections.

==War and death==
In 1966, the Nigerian crisis came to a head. Okigbo, living in Ibadan at the time, relocated to eastern Nigeria to await the outcome of the turn of events which culminated in the secession of the eastern provinces as independent Biafra on 30 May 1967. Living in Enugu, he worked together with Achebe to establish a new publishing house, Citadel Press.

With the secession of Biafra, Okigbo immediately joined the new state&#x27;s military as a volunteer, field-commissioned major. An accomplished soldier, he was killed in action during a major push by Nigerian troops in 1967 against Nsukka, the university town where he found his voice as a poet, and which he vowed to defend with his life.

==Legacy==
In July 1967, his hilltop house at Enugu, where several of his unpublished writings (perhaps including the beginnings of a novel) were, was destroyed in a bombing raid by the Nigerian air force. Also destroyed was &quot;Pointed Arches&quot;, an autobiography in verse which he describes in a letter to his friend and biographer, Sunday Anozie, as an account of the experiences of life and letters which conspired to sharpen his creative imagination.

Several of his unpublished papers are, however, known to have survived the war. Inherited by his daughter, Obiageli, who established the Christopher Okigbo Foundation in 2005 to perpetuate his legacy, the papers were catalogued in January 2006 by Chukwuma Azuonye, Professor of African Literature at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Boston, who assisted the foundation in nominating them for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Memory of the World International Register. The Christopher Okigbo Collection, including manuscripts, photographs, travel documents, and transcripts, was added to the register in 2007, recognising it as documentary heritage of global importance.

Azuonye&#x27;s preliminary studies of the papers indicate that, apart from new poems in English, including drafts of an Anthem for Biafra, Okigbo&#x27;s unpublished papers include poems written in Igbo language. The Igbo poems are fascinating in that they open up new vistas in the study of Okigbo&#x27;s poetry, countering the views of some critics, especially the troika (Chinweizu, Onwuchekwa Jemie and Ihechukwu Madubuike) in their 1980 &quot;Towards the Decolonization of African Literature&quot;, that he sacrificed his indigenous African sensibility in pursuit of obscurantist Euro-modernism.

&quot;Elegy for Alto&quot;, the final poem in &quot;Path of Thunder&quot;, is today widely read as the poet&#x27;s &quot;last testament&quot; embodying a prophecy of his own death as a sacrificial lamb for human freedom:

:&quot;Earth, unbind me; let me be the prodigal; let this be&quot;
:&quot;the ram’s ultimate prayer to the tether...&quot;

:&quot;AN OLD STAR departs, leaves us here on the shore&quot;
:&quot;Gazing heavenward for a new star approaching;&quot;
:&quot;The new star appears, foreshadows its going&quot;
:&quot;Before a going and coming that goes on forever...&quot;

The Okigbo Award was established by Wole Soyinka in his honor, in 1987. The first winner was Jean-Baptiste Tati Loutard, for &quot;La Tradition du Songe&quot; (1985).

<doc id="622455" wikidata="Q1637839" url="?curid=622455" title="Kouilou-Niari River">
<text>The Kouilou-Niari River—also spelled Kwilu, Kwila, or Kwil—is the most important river flowing to the Atlantic Ocean of the Republic of the Congo coast. Moreover, its entire drainage area is completely in the Republic of the Congo. 

==Geography and environment==
The river is called the Kouilou River while flowing in the coastal region of the Kouilou till the Sounda gorges. Upstream from the gorges, its name is the Niari River and it flows through the Niari Valley. The river combines with the Louessé, the Loudima and the Bouenza River and eventually flows into the Atlantic Ocean. It covers about 560 km from its origin in the Batéké Plateau of the Congo to its mouth at the coast. The lower Kouilou basin has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of many bird species.

==Hydrology==
The river has numerous waterfalls and is impassable from its mouth, which is of difficult access by multiple sandbars, formed primarily by the action of the Benguela current. The river is usable and boats are coming up to Kakamoéka. From Kakamoéka to Sounda, rapids and rocks are blocking access especially during dry season. Very limited traffic upstream Sounda as they are rapids and a few bridges. Bridges on the river are located at Bas-Kouilou, Sounda, Kimbangou, Makabana, Loudima and Bouenza.

The Kouilou part is fairly flat with the water level rising only 16 metres above sea level on first 70 km. In the area of Kimbangou, the water level is around 60 metres above sea level and reaches 115 metres at the Loudima junction.

===Waterfalls===

*&quot;Zrinski chutes&quot;: Honors Nikola Zrinski and Petar Zrinski, Croatian nobles; &quot;discovered&quot; and named in 1882 by a Croatian member (Dragutin Lerman) of Henry Morton Stanley&#x27;s exploration team. Local names, and local knowledge in general, are unfortunately ignored in such naming.
* Sounda gorges. The gorges are remarkable with a small waterdrop of two metres and mountain around 120 metres high. An old iron bridge is still usable in 2012 to cross the river in Sounda. A road comes from the village of Mandzi south of Sounda while the road continues on north west toward Kakamoéka, sous-prefecture. An abandoned track on the southern bank of the river reaches Kakamoéka which was created during the exploration for the train. The mission Jacob was conducted in 1896. The track was reopened in 1954 for the evaluation of the hydro potential of the Sounda dam.

==Hydroelectric developments==
In Sounda, a large hydro electrical project has been evaluated since the mid 1950s when France was looking at developing the region. Ten years of research have led to a tunnel built in the mountain, a bridge and a camp established on site.

In May 2011, a protocole d&#x27;accord has been signed with a South African Company IDG and the Republic of Congo for the development of the Sounda dam project.
IDG has teamed up with strategic partner African Power Corporation (APC). 
The two companies have joined forces to lead the development of the project. Coming together with the potential users and financial institution to put the project on track for success.
Such a project is expected to help develop the country&#x27;s huge mineral potential.
In October 2012, APC increased their presence in the country and name a country representative. Nicolas Rouzé has a great experience in the Congo as he has been in country since 1998. He is managing the efforts in the country to drive the project on the local scale.

<text>The Oldsmobile Intrigue is a mid-size sedan that was manufactured from 1997 through 2002 by Oldsmobile. The Intrigue&#x27;s design cues were first seen in 1995 with the Oldsmobile Antares concept car, being unveiled in production form in January 1996 at the North American International Auto Show. The Intrigue was the first casualty in the three-year phase-out process of Oldsmobile; Olds&#x27; remaining models would last an additional year or two.

The Oldsmobile Intrigue was introduced on May 5, 1997 as a 1998 model, and replaced the aging Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. It rode on the second-generation of the W-body, which it shared with the Buick Regal. The Oldsmobile Intrigue was supposed to compete with upscale Japanese and European imports such as Acura and BMW. The Oldsmobile Intrigue was heavily inspired by the Oldsmobile Aurora and the 1995 Oldsmobile Antares concept.

==History==

The Intrigue was available in three trim levels: base &quot;GX&quot;, mid-level &quot;GL&quot;, and high-end &quot;GLS&quot;. All models were equipped with standard features such as V6 power, antilock brakes, 4-wheel independent suspension, dual front airbags, and full power accessories. GL trim included the addition of a 6-way power adjustable driver&#x27;s seat, 6-speaker audio system, foglamps, and dual-zone automatic climate control. Top-line GLS added 6-way power front passenger seat, faux woodgrain interior trim, steering wheel audio controls, leather seating, full-function traction control, and a six-speaker Bose sound system.

All Intrigues were built at the GM Fairfax plant in Kansas City, Kansas, where the Grand Prix was also built (the Buick Century and Regal, and the Chevrolet Impala and Monte Carlo were all built in Oshawa, Ontario). For the 1999 model year, a new 3.5 L DOHC engine was introduced. It was a six-cylinder design based on Cadillac&#x27;s Northstar V8, which was nicknamed the &quot;Shortstar&quot;. The 3.5 L engine became standard for 2000, giving the Intrigue the most powerful standard engine of any W-body car.

Another exclusive was a standard 140 mph speedometer. With the Autobahn package the Intrigue came with larger 12-inch front brake rotors, being the first 2nd Gen W-body to incorporate bigger brakes. For 1998-99 models the Autobahn package consisted of a 3.29 differential ratio opposed to the standard 3.05, H-rated tires, 12-inch front brakes with ceramic pads, and a 128 mph speed limiter. For 2000 it was renamed Precision Sport Package which included everything from the Autobahn package except the larger 12-inch front brake rotors, and added the Precision Control System (also known as Vehicle Stability Control (VSC)). For 2002 the Intrigue Final 500 Collector’s Edition cars came in a unique Dark Cherry Metallic paint and featured Aurora-styled 17x7.5-inch chrome wheels.

On June 14, 2002, the final Intrigue rolled off the assembly line as part of the Final 500 Collectors Edition.

===Year-to-year changes===
*1998: The Oldsmobile Intrigue was introduced as an all new model. Available in GX (base), GL, and GLS trim, all featured the 3.8 L V6 and 4-speed automatic transmission standard.
*1999: For the beginning of this model year, the DOHC 3.5 L &quot;Shortstar&quot; engine was standard in the top-line GLS and optional on mid-level GL and base GX models. Early GLS models could be ordered with the 3.8L instead of the standard (for GLS) 3.5 L, but later on the 3.8 L was phased out and the 3.5 L became standard on all models. Decklids now wore a small Oldsmobile badge. In the previous model year, there was a complaint that some people couldn&#x27;t tell that Intrigues were Oldsmobiles. If you look closely, you can read &#x27;Oldsmobile&#x27; molded in the backup light lens in the taillight housing on all model years. All models now got a thicker, leather-wrapped steering wheel. An integrated rear radio antenna was standard this year and after.
*2000: New wheels featured a fancier six-spoke design. New to the option list for 2000 was an antiskid system called the Precision Control System. Precision Control System was designed to help keep the car on its intended path by selective braking of one or more individual wheels. Though optional on all models, GX buyers had to order optional traction control to get the new antiskid system. Heated power front seats were now standard on GLS models. Standard leather door inserts trim not cloth, Retained accessory power was standard this year. &quot;Oldsmobile&quot; emblem on deck lid is larger than on 1999 models, although some early 2000 models carried the smaller version. A new gold-trim package was also available. New automatic headlights were now standard on all models.
*2001: On GX models, traction control became standard instead of optional. Premium Leather and Precision Sport option packages were also available for this year. OnStar is now available as an optional feature.
*2002: GLS models now featured a two-tone interior with sterling accents, as well as standard HomeLink, sunroof, and driver lumbar. All models featured new family of radios with RDS and standard CD player (borrowed from the newly redesigned Aurora). Tropic Teal and Indigo Blue were two new exterior colors. All models had new LATCH (Lower Anchor and Top tether for Children) in three rear seat positions. Sun &amp; Sound package was available on GL models (includes Bose sound system and sunroof). New winchester headliner was inside. Production of the Intrigue ended in June 2002 as part of the phaseout of the Oldsmobile brand. The Final 500 Collectors Edition versions came in a unique Dark Cherry Metallic paint with special classic-style Oldsmobile emblems and featured Aurora-styled 17-inch chrome wheels. Owners also received a special commemorative packet.

Final 500 #499 was the last retail model and was special-ordered by a member of the Southern California Chapter of the Oldsmobile Club of America. 

===One-off variants===

* Intrigue 442 (1999) - A customized Intrigue wearing a body kit similar in design to the Oldsmobile 442, much like the Alero 442 show cars. It debuted at the 1999 SEMA show. It is painted in Pearl White and Gold for a Hurst style motif. It rides on custom 6 spoke rims. The Intrigue sports 6 Oldsmobile Tilted Rocket logos on its body: two on the front bumper below the turn signal lamps, two on the rear bumper below the corners of the rear fenders, and two small ones on the driver and front passenger doors. These door logos also sport &#x27;442&#x27; text in a brighter white to contrast against the car&#x27;s main body color. The logos on the doors are also embroidered into the headrests of the front seats, and is featured prominently on the engine cover. In total, the Intrigue 442 features 9 Tilted Rocket logos (11 if the standard bumper badge and steering wheel logo are counted). On the windshield is a sunstrip with &#x27;GM SEMA PROTOTYPE THE LAST OLDS 442 BUILT&#x27; printed in white text. It is powered by a 550hp Cadillac Northstar V8. The Intrigue 442 was sold at the Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale 2009 auction, and again at the Mecum Auction in 2022.

* Intrigue OSV (1999) - A custom Intrigue created as part of &quot;Oldsmobile Specialty Vehicles&quot;, an experiment in an aftermarket tuning brand for Oldsmobile. It debuted at the 1999 SEMA show. It features an Eaton supercharger fitted to its engine, raising its horsepower to 260, 13&quot; cross drilled Brembo brakes hidden behind custom 19&quot; RH Evolution C6 wheels with Oldsmobile center caps and fitted with Michelin Pilot XGT Z4 tires, Koni oilover struts and springs, Borla center exit exhausts, an aggressive body kit, and OSV fender badges, and is painted in a special cherry red paint, like the OSV Alero and OSV Silhouette. Inside, the OSV Intrigue is trimmed in red, gray, and beige leather, and features custom 8-positioned, climate-controlled Recaro seats with OSV-upholstered headrests, two-tone leather wrapped steering wheel, and titanium pedals. Standard features on the OSV Intrigue are: power windows/locks/steering/sunroof, cruise control, and a Delco AM/FM CD/Cassette stereo. It was sold at the Barrett-Jackson Palm Beach 2009 auction, and again in 2019 by Pinmaniac in Jacksonville, Florida. 

* Intrigue OSV II (2000) - Another Intrigue modified for OSV, this time painted in dark green. Little information exists on the Intrigue OSV II, but it appears largely the same as the 1999 Intrigue OSV. It is part of a second batch of OSVs alongside the Alero OSV II, and Silhouette OSV II. The engine used in this version of the Intrigue is the same V8 engine that came from the Aurora. The whereabouts of this OSV Intrigue are unknown.

==Engines==
* 1998–1999 OHV 3.8 L &quot;L36&quot; (231 in³) V6 195 hp at 5200 rpm, 220 lb·ft at 4000 rpm
* 1999–2002 DOHC 3.5 L &quot;LX5&quot; (212 in³) V6 215 hp at 5600 rpm 234 lb·ft at 4400 rpm (according to the Intrigue&#x27;s owner&#x27;s manual)

==In popular culture==

* The Oldsmobile Intrigue is featured in several scenes and promotions for the 1998 film &quot;The X-Files: Fight the Future&quot;. As the model&#x27;s launch coincided with the release of the film, its producers and GM&#x27;s executives at the time felt the car&#x27;s name and appearance fit with the aesthetic of the X-Files franchise. Their creative teams launched a national campaign which included an expo tour around &quot;&#x27;alternative&#x27; venues such as decomissioned military bases and airplane hangars [throughout the United States].&quot;

<text>Watsessing Park is a park in Essex County, New Jersey, in the city of East Orange and the Watsessing section of Bloomfield Township. The park covers 69 acres (279,000 m2), just west of the Garden State Parkway, and contains the confluence of the Second River and Toney&#x27;s Brook.

The name &quot;Watsessing&quot; comes from the language of the Lenni Lenape Indians who inhabited the area before European colonization; it means &quot;crooked&quot; or &quot;elbow&quot;. This etymology might have been related to the Third River, which also flows through Bloomfield (though not through Watsessing Park), and which forms an abrupt elbow near the town&#x27;s center.

Watsessing Park was designed in 1899 by the Olmsted Brothers of Brookline, Massachusetts (sons of Frederick Law Olmsted, designer of Manhattan&#x27;s Central Park).

<doc id="622469" wikidata="Q2018846" url="?curid=622469" title="Oldsmobile Aurora">
<text>The Oldsmobile Aurora is a luxury sedan, manufactured and marketed by General Motors from 1994 until 2003 over two generations — sharing platforms with Buick Riviera and using the Cadillac-derived G platform. At the time of production, the Aurora was the flagship vehicle in the Oldsmobile lineup. It originated as the 1989 Oldsmobile tube car concept.

The Aurora replaced the Toronado coupe and eventually the Oldsmobile 98, LSS and Regency in the Oldsmobile range — using V8 and V6 engines. It was equipped with a four-speed automatic transmission.

==Origins==
Early design work on what would become the Aurora began as early as the late 1980s with the 1989 Oldsmobile Tube Car engineering concept, designed by Bud Chandler. In addition to the overall similar shape, the Tube Car featured many detailed elements that were later found on the production automobile, including a full-width taillamp, wraparound rear windshield, and frameless windows. Unlike the eventual production car, the Tube Car used a pillarless hardtop design with suicide doors. The final production design was signed off on in July 1989, originally set for a 1992 start of production.

By the Aurora&#x27;s introduction, Oldsmobile sales had fallen from a record high of 1,066,122 in 1985 to 402,936 in 1993; rumors of the division&#x27;s demise were rampant, which GM at the time firmly denied. Competition from Acura, Infiniti and Lexus offered similar products that benefited from superior durability and reliability reputations. GM developed the Aurora to rejuvenate Oldsmobile as a result. The Aurora bore no Oldsmobile badging save for the radio-CD-cassette deck and engine cover (during focus group testing, potential customers had been repelled when they learned the Aurora was in truth an Oldsmobile). At one point, then-division head John Rock (who had recently arrived from the GMC division) proposed using the Aurora name to replace the Oldsmobile brand entirely and offer cars in a similar fashion to GM&#x27;s nascent Saturn division (a plan ultimately nixed by the GM higher-ups, though for a period Saturn&#x27;s no-haggle pricing was implemented). Instead, the Aurora used a stylized &quot;A&quot; emblem, foreshadowing a similar restyling of Oldsmobile&#x27;s corporate &quot;rocket&quot; emblem for 1997.

One bizarre footnote of development was a 1993 incident where a prototype Aurora, driven by freelance car reviewer Tim Dunne, was nearly totaled after a four-foot log fell from a Michigan Department of Natural Resources truck (Dunne was able to maneuver the Aurora so much that only the right front wheel was struck); this subsequently led then-governor John Engler to purchase an Aurora (Engler having been a life-long Oldsmobile customer).

Oldsmobile subsequently borrowed Aurora styling cues for its Intrigue and compact Alero models.

==First generation (1995–1999)==
The Aurora went into production on January 24, 1994, and was released for the 1995 model year, featuring dual-zone climate control, driver and front passenger airbags, leather seating surfaces, genuine burl walnut interior accents, six-speaker sound system with in-dash cd-cassette, and eight-way power adjustable front seats with 2-position memory. An onboard computer displaying the date, current gas consumption, and other information was also standard, and was mounted in the center of the dashboard, above the factory radio and climate controls. Options included a power sunroof, Bose Acoustimass premium amplified sound system, heated front seats, and Autobahn package.
The Aurora came standard with Oldsmobile&#x27;s L47 V8 engine, a DOHC engine based on Cadillac&#x27;s 4.6 L Northstar V8. The Northstar engine and 4T80-E had been exclusive to Cadillac prior to the Aurora. The L47 put out at 5600 rpm and torque at 4400 rpm. The Aurora used a four-speed automatic transmission with driver selectable &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;power&quot; shift modes. A highly modified version of this engine was used by General Motors racing division initially for Indy Racing League and IMSA competition starting in 1995 with the GM-supported Aurora GTS-1 racing program, then was later used in the Cadillac Northstar LMP program in 2000. Both engines retained the 4.0 L capacity, but the Northstar LMP version was twin-turbocharged. The Aurora had a drag coefficient of 0.32.

The Aurora was noted for its engine, build quality, ride, and structural integrity. During normal crush-to-failure tests to evaluate body torsional rigidity, the Aurora&#x27;s unibody construction broke GM&#x27;s testing machine. A frame-crusher otherwise used to test stronger truck frames had to be used, with the car twice exceeding federal standards for passenger cars.

First-generation Auroras were manufactured in Lake Orion, Michigan, along with the Buick LeSabre, Buick Park Avenue, Buick Riviera, Oldsmobile 88, Oldsmobile 98 and Pontiac Bonneville.

===Year-to-year changes===
=== 1996 ===

* For 1996, Oldsmobile made some minor revisions to the Aurora including new rear glass which has less distortion than previous models.
Further revisions include daytime running lights and OBD II compliant on-board diagnostic systems, tweaking the climate control and safety alarm, a revised keyless entry system with new features and the short list of optional equipment was expanded to include chrome wheels and a gold trim package. The 1996-&#x27;99 models also had the passenger temperature toggle buttons on the middle-right portion of the instrument panel replaced with air recirculator buttons.
* Chrome wheels are now an option.
* There were some minor equipment changes.

=== 1997 ===
There were minor changes for the Aurora in 1997. A new in-dash CD player for the Bose sound system highlighted the improvements. Another new feature was a tilt-down right-outside mirror that enhances the driver&#x27;s view of close objects, whenever the shifter is placed in reverse.
The underside of the door handles were slightly recontoured to minimize slipping fingers when the handles are pulled. Seat belt release buttons were moved from the face of the buckle to the end for improved convenience. An electronic compass was added to the inside rear-view mirror. Larger front brakes came along with cast aluminum front control arms and steering knuckles. The rear ashtray assembly was changed from a click-lock face to a pull-up face. Finally, the spare tire cover and jack cradle assembly was changed from the jack and cover being bolted down to one where the jack sat in a plastic &quot;bucket&quot; inside the spare with the cover simply placed on top.
On some 1997 models, a modest &quot;Oldsmobile&quot; badge returned to the right-rear corner of the car along with the Aurora name.

=== 1998 ===

The 1998 model had a few minor refinement changes to the brakes, suspension, steering and emissions controls. A new front control arm design with front hydraulic bushing and rear cross axis ball joint for enhanced ride smoothness and better isolation from road noise and vibration. Internal rebound springs added to front struts for improved body motion control and to minimize crash-through. Increased wheel travel (3 mm) and redesigned jounce bumpers for softer feel at full travel. Dual durometer cradle mounts for improved isolation. Premium valving and damping in the front and rear struts for a higher refinement in calibration. There were more accurate wheel sensors for improved ABS actuation. New steering calibration for more on-center feel and reduced parking effort.

GM&#x27;s previously optional OnStar system, standard for this year, uses a dedicated button on the cellular telephone putting drivers in contact with an information center that can provide them with emergency assistance. The system uses no transmitters to determine the vehicle&#x27;s location and provide route information to any destination.

Almost all of the changes made to the Aurora for 1998 were aimed at refining what was already a highly regarded suspension system.

=== 1999 ===
The last year for the first generation Aurora. Changes for 1999 included additional engine mounts for improved engine stability.

Production for this generation ended on June 25, 1999. No 2000 models were produced.

*Production figures for 1999 were not provided

==Second generation (2001–2003)==
Oldsmobile&#x27;s original intention for the second generation was to move the Aurora further upmarket, retaining its V8-only drivetrain and sharing a platform with the new Buick Riviera, as with the first gen Aurora. This would have created more room within the Oldsmobile line for a four-door Eighty-Eight successor to be marketed as the &quot;Antares&quot; (though there was talk of naming it the Aurora V-6 or Aurora 6, as the Antares name was not liked during focus group testing); this platform was known internally as &quot;G-plus&quot;. Buick dropped its Riviera development plans at the same time Oldsmobile faced fiscal trouble. The division was then forced to re-engineer the Antares into an acceptable Aurora in a short time. Still using the G-body design, the re-engineered Aurora was the result, retaining its 4.0 V8 Northstar mounted to a 4T80-E automatic transmission.

The second generation Aurora also offered a V6 engine, the LX5, a version of the DOHC Aurora V8 with six cylinders. The V6-powered Aurora was manufactured solely for model years 2001–2002, with production ending in mid-2002.

This Aurora did not sell as well as the original, overshadowed by GM&#x27;s announcement in December 2000 that the Oldsmobile marque was to be phased out over the next several years. Though still retaining its unique styling, it now also shared design cues with other Oldsmobiles. The second generation Aurora was about six inches shorter than was the first generation. &quot;Automobile&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;The Aurora&#x27;s new look is not quite as sensuous or elegant as that of the outgoing model,&quot; but the Auto Channel review said, &quot;it was better in every respect.&quot;

The second generation Aurora went into production on November 1, 1999, and went on sale in February 2000 as a 2001 model. The last V6-powered Auroras was assembled on June 21, 2002. The final 500 Auroras ended production on March 28, 2003. These were all a special burgundy color (called &quot;Dark Cherry Metallic&quot;), had special chrome wheels, and &quot;Final 500&quot; badging. The Orion, Michigan plant built a total of 71,722 second-generation Auroras; 53,640 in 2001, 10,865 in 2002, and 7,217 in 2003.

===Standard and optional equipment===
The second-generation Oldsmobile Aurora featured as standard equipment, keyless entry, security alarm, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces with power adjustments for the driver&#x27;s seat, an AM-FM stereo with radio data system (RDS) and cassette and single-disc CD players, a six-speaker sound system, leather door panel inserts, wood interior trim, automatic climate control, OnStar in-vehicle telematics system (later introduction), steering wheel-mounted climate and radio controls, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, power trunk release from the keyless entry remote, a multi-function driver&#x27;s information center mounted above the factory radio and climate controls, a rear bench seat with fold-down center armrest, luxury-styled alloy wheels, a spare tire and wheel, automatic front head and fog lamps, a 3.5L V6 engine, a 4-speed automatic transmission, front-wheel-drive (FWD), front and side SRS airbags.

Optional equipment included a driver&#x27;s memory package with memory front driver&#x27;s seat and memory for radio presets, heated dual front bucket seats, a premium audio system with external amplifier by Bose, a power tilt-and-sliding sunroof, chrome-finished alloy wheels, a gold emblem package for the front and rear Oldsmobile emblems, Aurora emblem, and 3.5 or 4.0 emblems, and the 4.0L Northstar V8 engine (this engine became standard equipment in 2003 for the Aurora&#x27;s final year of production).

Starting in 2002, a voice-activated, CD-ROM based navigation system was available. The 17-inch wheels’ plastic hub caps on the second generation V8 Auroras (except for the &quot;Final 500&quot; which used modified Cadillac wheels) were made with mold number 442.

<text>The Kwilu River (Portuguese: &quot;Rio Cuílo&quot;; French: &quot;Rivière Kwilu&quot;; Dutch: &quot;Kwilu Rivier&quot;) is a major river in both Lunda Norte Province and Lunda Sul Province in Angola as well as Kwilu Province, formerly known as Bandundu province, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to the city of Bandundu, where it joins the Kwango River just before this stream enters the Kasai River. In the DRC the river flows past the towns of Gungu, Kikwit, Bulungu, Bagata, Rutherfordia and Bandundu.
Lusanga, formerly Leverville, lies at the location where the Kwenge River joins the Kwilu, between Kikwit and Bulungu.

== Characteristics ==
It is a meandering river. Near its mouth it is 950 meters wide. The bed material is sand.
The river is about long. In the wet season the flooded area covers .
The headwaters of the river rise at elevations between and in the Angolan highlands. They drop steeply to the flat central Congo Basin at between and above sea level. A 2011 survey found 113 species of fish in 21 families and eight orders.

<text>U.S. Route 202 (US 202) is a spur route of US 2. It follows a northeasterly and southwesterly direction stretching from Delaware in the south to Maine in the north and traveling through the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. The highway has borne the number 202 since at least 1936. Before this, sections of the highway were designated U.S. Route 122, as it intersected US 22 in New Jersey. It intersects its parent route, US 2, in Bangor, Maine.

This highway is considerably longer than the eastern segment of US 2 (although considerably shorter than the combined segments of US 2), making it one of several three-digit U.S. highways to be longer than their parent routes.

===Delaware===
US 202 begins at an interchange with US 13/US 40 south of Wilmington. It runs north along the same road as Delaware Route 141, then joins with Interstate 95 through Wilmington. North of the city, it exits the freeway onto Concord Pike, heading north; Delaware Route 202 also continues south from this point. US 202 continues north towards the state line as a six-lane arterial road and is lined with numerous strip malls and &quot;big-box stores&quot;.

===Pennsylvania===

US 202 continues north toward West Chester, joining with US 322 after intersecting U.S. Route 1. South of West Chester, US 202/US 322 exits onto a limited-access bypass of the borough; that is the West Chester Bypass, and includes a grade-level intersection at Matlack Street. North of West Chester, US 322 exits, and US 202 continues north as a freeway towards Frazer, where it interchanges with U.S. Route 30 and bends east to head towards Malvern and King of Prussia. In King of Prussia, the highway forms a large, complicated interchange with the Schuylkill Expressway (Interstate 76) the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76/Interstate 276), and U.S. Route 422.

The freeway then transitions into a divided highway, passing the King of Prussia shopping mall and heading northeast through commercial areas before splitting into a one-way pair through the streets of Bridgeport and Norristown, crossing the Schuylkill River in the process.

North of Norristown, US 202 continues as a two-lane road heading northeast through the Philadelphia suburbs, passing through Blue Bell and Lower Gwynedd, where it becomes a four-lane highway for about two miles (3 km). East of Lansdale, in Montgomeryville, it turns into an expressway-grade parkway with a parallel trail, which opened in December 2012. It continues northeast toward Doylestown, where it joins an older section of bypass at Pennsylvania Route 611 and proceeds north to the old alignment of US 202 (State Street). It continues as a two-lane road to New Hope, crossing the Delaware River on the New Hope-Lambertville Toll Bridge.

===New Jersey===

On the toll bridge, US 202 has two lanes in each direction. It continues a northeasterly course for about as a freeway. This segment of US 202 was earlier called the US 202 bypass (as it bypassed the New Hope-Lambertville area) from its original route. The old section of US 202 between New Hope and Ringoes, New Jersey is now Route 179 which is also Old York Road, the first roadway to connect New York City and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1953, this section of Old York Road was renumbered US 202. A small section of the US 202 bypass was built in 1965 and the old route was renamed Route 179. When the western section of the bypass was built to the Delaware River, the whole former segment was renamed Route 179. The section of the new US 202 freeway section ends once it begins to run concurrently with Route 31 in East Amwell Township. The concurrency runs for five miles (8 km), to Flemington. This stretch, and the 13 miles (21 km) between Flemington and Somerville, is a four-lane divided roadway. In Bridgewater Township, just northwest of Somerville, US 202 has a junction with US 22 towards I-287 South.

At Somerville, the road merges with US 206 at a now-reconfigured Somerville Circle. Parts of the old traffic circle, which also carries Route 28, remain below the US 202 flyover. US 202 splits northeastward from US 206 at Bedminster Township and again becomes a two-lane road.

From here to the state line, US 202 parallels, and has largely been supplanted by, I-287, which during its construction dumped traffic onto US 202. US 202 continues through Morristown to Morris Plains with an intersection with Route 53. With a few exceptions, US 202 is maintained by counties rather than the New Jersey Department of Transportation north of Route 53. The only sections of US 202 in New Jersey north of Route 53 that are state-maintained are at the I-80 interchange, at the US 46 intersection, along the Route 23 concurrency, and at the I-287 interchange in Oakland.

US 202 continues past Boonton along the Boonton Turnpike to historic Mountain View in Wayne, where it then picks up Route 23 for about two miles (3 km) and then exits on Black Oak Ridge Road. It then follows the Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike, Terhune Drive on the east side of Pompton Lake (past the former homes of Cecil B. DeMille and Albert Payson Terhune), and Ramapo Valley Road (more or less paralleling the Ramapo River through Oakland) to Mahwah before crossing the New York state line on the Franklin Turnpike.

===New York===


US 202 is mostly designated east–west in New York, owing to its greater coverage in those directions.

Franklin Turnpike becomes Orange Avenue in Suffern, and US 202 continues to a block-long wrong-way concurrency with NY 59 before tailing off on Wayne Avenue and heading east toward Haverstraw. Most of this stretch is a two-lane road.

At Haverstraw, US 202 makes a sharp left turn north onto US 9W and follows US 9W&#x27;s path for 13 miles (21 km) towards Bear Mountain and then crosses the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge, running concurrently with US 6, the Grand Army of the Republic Highway. The two wind around Anthony&#x27;s Nose, briefly forming New York&#x27;s only three-way concurrency of U.S. highways with US 9 at Peekskill. Afterwards, the two separate for several miles, with US 202 taking the more southerly route through Somers. The highways reunite at Brewster and become a four-lane road for their last few miles before the state line, taking in NY 121 in the process.

===Connecticut===
US 202 is signed east–west in Connecticut. At Danbury, US 6 and 202 climb up onto I-84, which had just been joined by the north–south US 7, making a four-way concurrency. US 7 and 202 split from I-84 and US 6 at Exit 7. It is a two-lane road in southern Brookfield as it follows Federal Road. US 202 diverts from U.S. Route 7 at the next exit to a parallel surface route. The US 7 freeway continues for another before it rejoins US 202 at the Brookfield/New Milford town line. The now rejoined US 7 and 202 approach New Milford in bucolic Litchfield County, where they once again split.

US 202 continues through Torrington and on to Cherry Brook, where it then runs concurrently with US 44 for several miles before turning northward at Avon. For the run to the state line, US 202 runs concurrently with Route 10.

===Massachusetts===
Unlike elsewhere in New England, US 202 is posted as a north–south highway in Massachusetts, as the highway runs mostly in those directions for its length through the state. US 202 and Route 10 enter the Bay State at the &quot;Congamond Notch&quot; in Southwick, a southward jog in the state line that includes Congamond Lake. North of Westfield, US 202 turns eastward toward Holyoke, crosses the Connecticut River on the Joseph E. Muller Bridge and travels for 1.5 miles as a limited access bypass of South Hadley, traversing MA 116 and MA 33 toward Belchertown. After crossing MA 9, it then heads north along the west side of the Quabbin Reservoir through New Salem toward Athol. This section of US 202 has been dubbed the Daniel Shays Highway, named for a Revolutionary War veteran who led an insurrection against the state government of Massachusetts. US 202 meets Massachusetts Route 2 at Orange, and runs along the two-lane freeway to Phillipston. There, it diverges to the north again as a two-lane road.

In Massachusetts, US 202 passes through the municipalities of Southwick, Westfield, Holyoke, South Hadley, Granby, Belchertown, Pelham, Shutesbury, New Salem, Orange, Athol, Phillipston, Templeton, and Winchendon.

The stretch of highway through Belchertown, Pelham, Shutesbury, and New Salem opened in 1935 to coincide with the completion and opening of the Quabbin Reservoir. The roadway reaches its closest point to the reservoir itself at the crossing of the Swift River, at the Shutesbury/New Salem town line. Access to the west side of the Quabbin Reservation is made through multiple gates in the three towns. There is no public access, however, to the Prescott Peninsula.

===New Hampshire===
US 202 is posted as an east–west highway in New Hampshire. It remains a two-lane highway for most of its length in the Granite State.

It heads north, through Rindge, Jaffrey, and Peterborough, to Hillsborough, where it turns eastward along a concurrency with New Hampshire Route 9. The span of the road between Hillsborough and Hopkinton, which passes through Henniker, is among the most deadly sections of roadway in the state. At Concord, New Hampshire, the state capital, US 202 heads north and picks up a concurrency with US 3 for a short time, and then turns eastward again along Interstate 393, a freeway spur that also carries US 4. The freeway ends short of Chichester, and NH 9 rejoins the two-lane concurrency along with US 4 and 202.

At Northwood, US 202 and NH 9 leave US 4. NH 9 splits off a few miles later, leaving US 202 to continue alone toward Rochester, where the road jumps up onto the Spaulding Turnpike (NH 16) for a short, non-tolled distance. US 202 leaves the turnpike two miles (3 km) before the state line at East Rochester.

===Maine===
US 202 is posted as an east–west highway in Maine.

The highway enters the state by crossing the Salmon Falls River at South Lebanon and bridges the Mousam River in Sanford. The highway then passes through Alfred, Waterboro and Hollis before crossing the Saco River at Salmon Falls. The highway passes through Gorham and crosses the Presumpscot River into South Windham. There is a rotary with U.S. Route 302 (US 202&#x27;s only connection to US 2) at Foster&#x27;s Corner and an interchange with I-95 at Gray. The highway parallels I-95 through New Gloucester to Auburn and crosses the Androscoggin River into Lewiston, passing near the campus of Bates College. A very short stretch through the latter two cities is four-lane highway, but most of its length in the Pine Tree State consists of two-lane road. Its final miles west of Hampden, including the short overlay on I-395, and concurrency with US 1A also include four-laned segments.

The highway passes through Greene, Monmouth, and Winthrop concurrently with Maine Route 11 and Maine Route 100 and becomes concurrent with State Route 17 at Manchester. US 202 runs concurrently with U.S. Route 201 as it crosses the Kennebec River at Augusta, and shortly thereafter it picks up State Route 3 and State Route 9. US 202 is concurrent with I-395 and SR 15 briefly, then meets its parent, U.S. Route 2 in downtown Bangor.

==History==
US 122 was created in 1926, connecting US 22 at Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, with US 13 in Wilmington, Delaware. It was extended to Haverstraw, New York in 1931 and became part of US 202 in 1934.

US 202 was approved by the AASHO (now AASHTO) in June 1934; the route approved was , from Bangor, Maine, to State Road, Delaware, south of Wilmington. In 1964, the AASHO approved a request by Delaware to eliminate the portion of US 202 between its intersection with I-295 in Farnhurst and State Road; that stretch was carrying US 13/40/301. US 202 was later shortened so that it ended at I-95 just north of Wilmington. Then in 1984, the route numbering committee approved extending US 202 from there to its intersection with US 13/US 40 in Basin Corner, near New Castle. This intersection is US 202&#x27;s current terminus.

US 202&#x27;s path passes near the sites of various important Revolutionary War battles in Delaware and Pennsylvania, such as Cooch&#x27;s Bridge, near Newark, Delaware; Brandywine, near Philadelphia; and Valley Forge. In New Hampshire, US 202 passes by a historical marker in Antrim commemorating the last surviving soldier of the Revolutionary War.

In Pennsylvania in the early 1960s, a four-lane expressway, the Piedmont Expressway, was proposed that would follow the US 202 corridor. The expressway was to be long, and would cost approximately $146 million. It was to serve as an outer beltway around the Philadelphia area. The project was ultimately cancelled. In its place, the Route 202 Parkway Trail was built. The trail is in length. The trail is ultimately expected to connect to the East Coast Greenway via the Neshaminy Creek Trail.

Construction began in November 2008 on a parkway project between Pennsylvania Route 63 in Lower Gwynedd and the existing cloverleaf interchange at the US 202 bypass and PA 611 near Doylestown. This parkway was planned to consist of a four-lane stretch between Route 63 and Pennsylvania Route 463 and a two-lane parkway the rest of the way that bypasses the boroughs of Chalfont and New Britain. The parkway opened on December 3, 2012.

US 202 originally ended at its junction with US 2/US 1A in Bangor, Maine. In the late 1980s, however, the section of US 202 between I-395 and US 2 was removed from US 202&#x27;s official routing. Officially, US 202 ends at I-395&#x27;s exit 3. However, signs designating US 202&#x27;s termination at US 2 in downtown Bangor, at the corner of Main Street and Hammond Street, still stand today. That intersection is still seen as US 202&#x27;s end.

<doc id="622494" wikidata="Q11791804" url="?curid=622494" title="Unfair business practices">
<text>Unfair business practices (also Unfair Commercial Practices) describes a set of practices by businesses which are considered unfair, and which may be unlawful. It includes practices which are covered by other areas of law, such as fraud, misrepresentation, and oppressive or unconscionable contract terms. 
Protections may be afforded to business-to-business dealings, or may be limited to those dealing as consumers. Regulation of such practices is a departure from traditional views of freedom to agree on contractual terms, summed up in the 1804 French Civil Code as &quot;qui dit contractuel dit juste&quot; (roughly, anything contractual is fair).

==Canada==
Canadian provinces enact their own consumer protection laws which differ in scope and coverage. For example, Saskatchewan&#x27;s Consumer Protection Act says:
It is an unfair practice for a supplier, in a transaction or proposed transaction involving goods or services, to: (a) do or say anything, or fail to do or say anything, if as a result a consumer might reasonably be deceived or misled; (b) make a false claim; (c) take advantage of a consumer if the person knows or should reasonably be expected to know that the consumer: (i) is not in a position to protect his or her own interests; or (ii) is not reasonably able to understand the nature of the transaction or proposed transaction.

For example, the Saskatchewan Act has been applied to a case in which an automobile dealer mis-sold cars, based on allegations of false claims, representing goods as new or unused when they weren&#x27;t, and using exaggeration, innuendo, or ambiguity when representing material facts.

Other Canadian provinces have laws headed &quot;Unfair Trade Practices Act&quot; (Alberta), &quot;Trade Practices Act&quot; (B.C.), &quot;Business Practices Act&quot; (Ontario), &quot;Consumer Protection Act (Quebec), and Trade Practices Inquiry Act (Manitoba).

==European Union==

Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005 (amended 2017) each member state is required to regulate unfair business practices. As the EU described its objectives:

The objective of the EU Directive on unfair commercial practices from 2005 was to boost consumer confidence and make it easier for businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to trade across borders. It is the overarching EU legislation regulating unfair commercial practices that occur before, during and after a business-to-consumer transaction has taken place.

==United States==

In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission addresses unfair business practices. It has in the past included in its mission the goal of preventing &quot;fraud, deception, and unfair business practices in the marketplace&quot;. It does so by &quot;collecting reports from consumers and conducting investigations, suing companies and people that break the law, developing rules to maintain a fair marketplace, and educating consumers and businesses about their responsibilities&quot;. Individual states within the U.S. are also responsible for protecting consumers against unfair practices.

==United Kingdom==

In the United Kingdom unfair business practices are Unfair terms in English contract law by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, Consumer Rights Act 2015 and Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations.

==Australia==
In Australia unfair business practices are regulated under the Australian Consumer Law which is enforced by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC). For example, in 2023 the ACCC took action against airline Qantas for, among other things, advertising and allowing customers to book unavailable flights.
The law provides, among other things, that &quot;A person must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.&quot;

<doc id="622495" wikidata="Q3025969" url="?curid=622495" title="Dialogic">
<text>Dialogic refers to the use of conversation or shared dialogue to explore the meaning of something. (This is as opposed to monologic which refers to one entity with all the information simply giving it to others without exploration and clarification of meaning through discussion.) The word &quot;dialogic&quot; relates to or is characterized by dialogue and its use. A dialogic is communication presented in the form of dialogue. Dialogic processes refer to implied meaning in words uttered by a speaker and interpreted by a listener. Dialogic works carry on a continual dialogue that includes interaction with previous information presented. The term is used to describe concepts in literary theory and analysis as well as in philosophy.

Along with &quot;dialogism&quot;, the term can refer to concepts used in the work of Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin, especially the texts &quot;Problems of Dostoevsky&#x27;s Poetics&quot; and &quot;The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays by M.M. Bakhtin&quot;.

==Overview==
Bakhtin contrasts the dialogic and the &quot;monologic&quot; work of literature. The dialogic work carries on a continual dialogue with other works of literature and other authors. It does not merely answer, correct, silence, or extend a previous work, but informs and is continually informed by the previous work. Dialogic literature is in communication with multiple works. This is not merely a matter of influence, for the dialogue extends in both directions, and the previous work of literature is as altered by the dialogue as the present one is. Though Bakhtin&#x27;s &quot;dialogic&quot; emanates from his work with colleagues in what we now call the &quot;Bakhtin Circle&quot; in years following 1918, his work was not known to the West or translated into English until the 1970s. For those only recently introduced to Bakhtin&#x27;s ideas but familiar with T. S. Eliot, his &quot;dialogic&quot; is consonant with Eliot&#x27;s ideas in &quot;Tradition and the Individual Talent,&quot; where Eliot holds that &quot;the past should be altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past&quot;. For Bakhtin, the influence can also occur at the level of the individual word or phrase as much as it does the work and even the oeuvre or collection of works. A German cannot use the word &quot;fatherland&quot; or the phrase &quot;blood and soil&quot; without (possibly unintentionally) also echoing (or, Bakhtin would say &quot;refracting&quot;) the meaning that those terms took on under Nazism. Every word has a history of usage to which it responds, and anticipates a future response.

The term &#x27;dialogic&#x27; does not only apply to literature. For Bakhtin, all language—indeed, all thought—appears as dialogical. This means that everything anybody ever says always exists in response to things that have been said before and in anticipation of things that will be said in response. In other words, we do not speak in a vacuum. All language (and the ideas which language contains and communicates) is dynamic, relational and engaged in a process of endless redescriptions of the world.

Bakhtin also emphasized certain uses of language that maximized the dialogic nature of words, and other uses that attempted to limit or restrict their polyvocality. At one extreme is novelistic discourse, particularly that of a Dostoevsky (or Mark Twain) in which various registers and languages are allowed to interact with and respond to each other. At the other extreme would be the military order (or &quot;1984&quot; newspeak) which attempts to minimize all orientations of the work toward the past or the future, and which prompts no response but obedience.

==Distinction between dialogic and dialectic==
A dialogic process stands in contrast to a dialectic process (proposed by G. W. F. Hegel):
* In a dialectic process describing the interaction and resolution between multiple paradigms or ideologies, one putative solution establishes primacy over the others. The goal of a dialectic process is to merge point and counterpoint (thesis and antithesis) into a compromise or other state of agreement via conflict and tension (synthesis). &quot;Synthesis that evolves from the opposition between thesis and antithesis.&quot; Examples of dialectic process can be found in &quot;Plato&#x27;s Republic&quot;.
* In a dialogic process, various approaches coexist and are comparatively existential and relativistic in their interaction. Here, each ideology can hold more salience in particular circumstances. Changes can be made within these ideologies if a strategy does not have the desired effect. 
These two distinctions are observed in studies of personal identity, national identity, and group identity.

Sociologist Richard Sennett has stated that the distinction between dialogic and dialectic is fundamental to understanding human communication. Sennett says that dialectic deals &quot;with the explicit meaning of statements, and tends to lead to closure and resolution&quot;. Whereas dialogic processes, especially those involved with regular spoken conversation, &quot;involve a type of listening that attends to the implicit intentions behind the speaker&#x27;s actual words.&quot; Unlike a dialectic process, dialogics often do not lead to closure and remain unresolved. Compared to dialectics, a dialogic exchange can be less competitive, and more suitable for facilitating cooperation.

==Early life and education==
Phylicia Ayers-Allen was born on June 19, 1948, in Houston, Texas. Her mother, Vivian Ayers, is a Pulitzer Prize-nominated artist, poet, playwright, scholar, and publisher. Her father, Andrew Arthur Allen, was an orthodontist. Her siblings are brother Tex (Andrew Arthur Allen Jr.), a jazz-musician; sister Debbie Allen, an actress, choreographer, and director; and brother Hugh Allen, now a real estate banker in Charlotte, North Carolina. Their parents divorced when Phylicia was six. Seven years later, her mother moved with the two sisters to Mexico City, Mexico, to avoid segregation in the United States. Ayers-Allen later studied at Howard University, graduating &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1970 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. While there, she was initiated into the Alpha chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.

==Career==
===1971–1983: Early work and Broadway debut ===
Ayers-Allen first became known for her roles on stage, making her Broadway debut in the Melvin Van Peebles musical &quot;Ain&#x27;t Supposed to Die a Natural Death&quot; (1971). Throughout the decade she returned to Broadway in a string of productions playing Deena Jones in &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; (she also was Sheryl Lee Ralph&#x27;s understudy until leaving the show in 1982, after being passed over as Ralph&#x27;s full-time replacement). She played a Munchkin in &quot;The Wiz&quot; for three and a half years. In 1978, she released the album &quot;Josephine Superstar&quot;, a disco concept album telling the life story of Josephine Baker. The album was mainly written and produced by Jacques Morali and Victor Willis, Rashad&#x27;s second husband and the original lead singer and lyricist of the Village People. She met Willis while they were both cast in &quot;The Wiz&quot;.

===1982–2003: &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and other roles ===
Other Broadway credits include &quot;&quot;, &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, &quot;Gem of the Ocean&quot;, &quot;Raisin in the Sun&quot; (2004 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play/Drama Desk Award), &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Jelly&#x27;s Last Jam&quot;, &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Supposed to Die a Natural Death&quot;. Off-Broadway credits include Lincoln Center&#x27;s productions of &quot;Cymbeline&quot; and &quot;Bernarda Alba&quot;; &quot;Helen&quot;, &quot;The Story&quot; and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Ruby&quot; at the Public Theater; The Negro Ensemble Company productions of &quot;Puppet Play&quot;, &quot;Zooman and the Sign&quot;, &quot;Sons and Fathers of Sons&quot;, &quot;In an Upstate Motel&quot;, &quot;Weep Not For Me&quot;, and &quot;The Great Mac Daddy&quot;; Lincoln Center&#x27;s production of Ed Bullins&#x27; &quot;The Duplex&quot;; and &quot;The Sirens&quot; at the Manhattan Theatre Club. In regional theatre, she performed as Euripides&#x27; &quot;Medea&quot; and in &quot;Blues for an Alabama Sky&quot; at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia. Other regional theatres at which she has performed are the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., and the Huntington Theatre in Boston.

Rashad joined the cast of the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; to play publicist Courtney Wright in 1983. She is best known for the role of attorney Clair Huxtable on the NBC sitcom &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. The show, which ran from 1984 to 1992, starred Bill Cosby as obstetrician Heathcliff &quot;Cliff&quot; Huxtable, and focused on their life with their five children. For her role, she earned two Primetime Emmy Award nominations in 1985 and 1986. In 1985, Rashad co-hosted the NBC telecast of the &quot;Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade&quot; with Pat Sajak and Bert Convy. When Cosby returned to TV comedy in 1996 with CBS&#x27;s &quot;Cosby&quot;, he called Rashad to play Ruth Lucas, his character&#x27;s wife. The pilot episode had been shot with Telma Hopkins, but Cosby fired the executive producer and replaced Hopkins with Rashad. The sitcom ran from 1996 to 2000. That year, Cosby also asked Rashad to work on his animated television series &quot;Little Bill&quot;, in which the actress voiced Bill&#x27;s mother, Brenda, until the show&#x27;s end in 2004.

In 1993, Rashad was the first narrator at Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional when the event was moved to Epcot. Her narration of the nativity story was recorded and released by Walt Disney Records. She also played a role in the pre-show of the Dinosaur ride at Walt Disney World&#x27;s Animal Kingdom theme park as Dr. Helen Marsh, the head of the Dino Institute.

=== 2004–2018: Theatre roles and acclaim ===

In the early 21st century, Rashad was the first black actress of any nationality to win the Best Actress (Play) Tony Award, for her 2004 performance as Lena Younger in a revival of the play &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; by Lorraine Hansberry. Rashad also won the 2004 Drama Desk Award for Best Actress in a Play for &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot;, tying (split award that year) with Viola Davis for the play &quot;Intimate Apparel&quot;. Rashad was nominated again for a Tony the following year, for her performance in &quot;Gem of the Ocean&quot;. In 2007, Rashad made her directorial debut with the Seattle Repertory Theatre&#x27;s production of August Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Gem of the Ocean&quot;. In 2008, Rashad starred on Broadway as Big Mama in an all African-American production of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning drama &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, directed by her sister Debbie Allen. She appeared alongside stage veterans James Earl Jones (Big Daddy) and Anika Noni Rose (Maggie), as well as film actor Terrence Howard, who made his Broadway debut as Brick.
Rashad played &quot;Kill Moves&quot;&#x27; wealthy mother on the Chris Rock created sitcom &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot; on December 9, 2007. In 2007 she appeared as Winnie Guster in the &quot;Psych&quot; episode &quot;Gus&#x27;s Dad May Have Killed an Old Guy&quot;. She returned to the role in 2008, in the episode &quot;Christmas Joy&quot;. In February 2008, Rashad portrayed Lena Younger in the television film adaptation of &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot;, directed by Kenny Leon. It starred core members of the cast of the 2004 Broadway revival at the Royale Theatre of Lorraine Hansberry&#x27;s 1959 play, including Audra McDonald as Ruth Younger, and Sean Combs as Walter Lee Younger. The television film adaption debuted at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and was broadcast by ABC on February 25, 2008. According to Nielsen Media Research, the program was watched by 12.7 million viewers and ranked No. 9 in the ratings for the week ending March 2, 2008.

In 2009, she appeared as Violet Weston, the drug-addicted matriarch of Tracy Letts&#x27;s award-winning play &quot;&quot;, at the Music Box Theatre. Rashad returned to directing August Wilson&#x27;s work in early 2014, when she led a revival of Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Fences&quot;, at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey. It received generally positive reviews. She continued to focus on Wilson&#x27;s work, including a well-received production of &quot;Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom&quot;, which she directed at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in late 2016. From March 17 to May 1, 2016, Rashad played the lead role of Shelah in Tarell Alvin McCraney&#x27;s play &quot;Head of Passes&quot; at The Public Theater. Her performance was positively reviewed. In November 2010, Rashad featured as Gilda in the ensemble cast in the Tyler Perry film &quot;For Colored Girls&quot;, based on the play &quot;For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf&quot; by Ntozake Shange. Rashad said about this work in an interview with &quot;Vibe Movies &amp; TV&quot; in 2010: &quot;I saw the original Broadway play. I thought it was amazing how such a story that wasn&#x27;t pretty was poetry. Usually poetry is about lofty things and this was the poetry of speech and the movement of everyday people. I found a little bit of it off-putting to tell you the truth, because it was so angry when I saw it. And I think Tyler Perry has added an element here that wasn&#x27;t in the original stage production, and that is the necessity for taking responsibility for one&#x27;s own self otherwise you are just living to die. That is where he wrote the line [in the film], &#x27;You gotta take some responsibility in this. Otherwise you are just living to die.&#x27;&quot;

In 2012, she starred in another Tyler Perry film, &quot;Good Deeds&quot;. Also in 2012, Rashad played Clairee Belcher in the remake of &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (the role originated by Olympia Dukakis). This version has an all African American A-list cast, including Queen Latifah as M&#x27;Lynn, Jill Scott as Truvy, Condola Rashād as Shelby, Adepero Oduye as Annelle, and Alfre Woodard as Ouiser. In 2015, she played Mary Anne Creed in the sports film &quot;Creed&quot; (2015), and again in the sequels &quot;Creed II&quot; (2018) and &quot;Creed III&quot; (2023). In 2016, Rashad was cast as a recurring guest star in the role of Diana DuBois in the third season of the Lee Daniels-produced &quot;Empire&quot; television series on Fox. In 2017, Rashad portrayed Bishop Yvette A. Flunder, pastor of The City of Refuge Church in San Francisco, Calif., as part of the Dustin Lance Black mini-series &quot;When We Rise&quot;. Her appearance in the show highlighted the reputed compassion of the church, the commitment of its leadership, and the loving home the church provides to minister in the tough, primarily African-American community in San Francisco.

=== 2019–present ===
From 2019 to 2021 she portrayed Carol Clarke in the NBC drama series &quot;This is Us&quot; earning three Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series nominations. In 2020, Rashad provided the voice of Libba Gardner, Joe Gardner&#x27;s mother, in the Pixar animated film &quot;Soul&quot; which earned the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. That same year she had a supporting role in the family Christmas film &quot;Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey&quot; starring Forest Whitaker and Keegan-Michael Key. The following year she had a cameo role in the Lin-Manuel Miranda directed musical drama &quot;Tick, Tick...Boom!&quot; (2021). She had recurring roles on the Netflix drama series &quot;13 Reasons Why&quot; (2020) and the CBS / Paramount+ legal series &quot;The Good Fight&quot; (2022). She returned to Broadway in the Dominique Morisseau play &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot; (2022) for which she earned a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. In 2024, she appeared in the action film &quot;The Beekeeper&quot;.

== Academia and legacy ==
She was dubbed &quot;The Mother of the Black Community&quot; at the 2010 NAACP Image Awards. In May 2021, Rashad was appointed as dean of Howard University&#x27;s Chadwick A. Boseman College of Fine Arts. In August 2023, Howard University announced Rashad was going to step down from the position of dean at the end of the 2023–24 academic year.

Rashad also received an Honorary Doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University.

==Personal life==
Rashad is a vegetarian.

=== Marriages and family ===
Rashad&#x27;s first marriage, in 1972, was to dentist William Lancelot Bowles Jr. They had one son, William Lancelot Bowles III, who was born the following year. The marriage ended in 1975. Rashad married Victor Willis (original lead singer of the Village People) in 1978; they had met during the run of &quot;The Wiz&quot;. They divorced in 1982.

She married a third time, to Ahmad Rashad on December 14, 1985. He was a former NFL wide receiver and sportscaster. It was a third marriage for each of them, and she took his last name. He proposed to her during a pregame show for a nationally televised Thanksgiving Day football game between the New York Jets and the Detroit Lions on November 28, 1985. Their daughter, Condola Phylea Rashād, was born on December 11, 1986, in New York. The couple divorced in early 2001, and she has retained the surname Rashad.

=== Friendship with Bill Cosby ===
Rashad was friendly with co-star Bill Cosby, who gave her away at her 1985 wedding to Ahmad Rashad. In June 2021, when Cosby&#x27;s 2018 conviction for sexual assault was overturned on a technicality, Rashad tweeted &quot;FINALLY!!!! A terrible wrong is being righted- a miscarriage of justice is corrected!&quot; This was widely criticized, and characterized as rape apologism. Some called for Howard University to revoke her appointment, and it stated that &quot;Personal positions of University leadership do not reflect Howard University&#x27;s policies.&quot; Rashad later apologized in an email to Howard University students and their parents.

<doc id="622502" wikidata="Q1234381" url="?curid=622502" title="Dodge Spirit">
<text>The Dodge Spirit is a midsize automobile marketed by Dodge from the 1989 to the 1995 model years. Succeeding the Dodge Aries, Dodge Lancer, and Dodge 600 , the Spirit was marketed between the Shadow and the Dynasty within the Dodge product line, exclusively as a four-door notchback sedan over a single generation. 

The Spirit used the Chrysler AA platform, an extended-wheelbase derivative of the Chrysler K platform and rebadged variants were marketed by all three Chrysler divisions, including as the Plymouth Acclaim, 1990-1994 Chrysler LeBaron sedan — and in Europe as the Chrysler Saratoga. 

Chrysler assembled the Spirit and its rebadged variants at Newark Assembly (Newark, Delaware) and Toluca Car Assembly (Toluca, Mexico) with production ending on December 9, 1994, replaced for model year 1995 by the Dodge Stratus.

== Design overview ==
The Spirit could seat six passengers with an optional front split-bench seat. Featuring a solid-beam rear axle and a MacPherson strut front suspension, the Spirit differed from the other A-bodies primarily in the grille and rear lamp styling, and in the availability of a sportier, higher-performing R/T version.

=== Powertrain details ===

The base engine for Spirit and Spirit LE models was a TBI 4-cylinder engine producing . Optional on all models except the Spirit R/T was a , L V6 made by Mitsubishi. Also available in 1989 through 1992—and standard equipment on the Spirit ES—was a turbocharged version of the 2.5 L engine. In 1993, 1994, and 1995, a flexible-fuel Spirit was offered, powered by a multipoint fuel injected version of the 2.5 L engine specially modified to run on fuel containing up to 85% methanol. The R/T version came with a powerful DOHC turbo III with cylinder head engineered and made by Lotus. This engine was rated at and .

Several five-speed manual transmissions were available with the naturally aspirated and turbocharged four-cylinder engines, but relatively few Spirits were equipped with manual transmissions. All the Spirit R/Ts came with the A-568 heavy-duty 5-speed manual transmission. From 1989 to 1991, all V6 Spirits came with the electronic four-speed A604 overdrive automatic, which became optional equipment in 1992 and remained optional until 1995. The three-speed Torqueflite automatic was the most popular installation on 4-cylinder Spirits, and was also standard equipment with the V6 engine from 1992 through 1995. A 5-speed manual was offered with the V6 engine in the smaller Shadow, but this combination was not available in the Spirit.

=== Trim ===
* 1989–95: Base
* 1989–91: LE
* 1989–93: ES
* 1991–92: R/T

The Spirit ES and R/T featured &quot;Eurocast&quot; (also called &quot;Snowflake&quot;) alloy wheels through 1991. For 1992, the &quot;Turbo Blade&quot; wheel was introduced. Some of the alloy wheels were color-keyed to the vehicle body:

*White body with white painted wheels (ES, R/T)
*Black, silver, or dark red body with clear-coated wheels (ES only)
*Bright Red body with bright red painted wheel inserts (R/T only, 1991)

Starting in 1993, the Spirit was offered with a &quot;Gold&quot; package similar to that offered on the 1993-94 Plymouth Acclaim and Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager minivans. This included goldtone-trimmed alloy wheels and gold pinstripes. The Gold package was available with both 4- and 6-cylinder engines, with certain body colors.

== Model history ==

*1990 – A driver airbag was added as standard equipment. 
* 1991 – Anti-lock four-wheel disk brake system was added as a new option.
* 1992 – A 3-speed automatic transmission became available with the V6 engine.
* 1993 – A facelift included a body-color grille with the Dodge crossbars theme and new full-width taillamps that despite their amber lower sections, did not include amber rear turn signals. Only two trim levels went on sale: Highline and ES. The Chrysler corporate Pentastar emblem was replaced with the brand&#x27;s new RAM emblem. Stainless steel exhaust system and tinted glass became standard on all Spirits.
* 1994 – A motorized passenger&#x27;s side seat belt was added to U.S.-market Spirits to comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208&#x27;s requirement for passive restraints. These motorized belts do not comply with Canada&#x27;s safety standards; Canadian-market Spirits continued to use a manual passenger seatbelt, and 1994–1995 Spirits therefore cannot legally be permanently imported across the US/Canada border in either direction.
* 1995 – The 2.5 L engine received a slightly revised cylinder head, and both the 4-speed A604 automatic transmission and anti-lock brakes were dropped from the option list. Otherwise, the Spirit remained mostly unchanged, much as it had throughout its six-year run.

==Spirit R/T==


In 1991, Chrysler introduced the Spirit R/T, featuring a version of the 2.2 L engine with a 16-valve DOHC head designed by Lotus, who won a design competition against Maserati and Hans Hermann. Fed by a Garrett intercooled turbocharger, the &quot;Turbo III&quot; engine produced and . The R/T also featured unique interior and exterior trims. The only transmission was a heavy-duty A568 5-speed manual transmission built by Chrysler&#x27;s New Process Gear division, with a gearset supplied by Getrag. Heavy-duty vented four wheel disc brakes were standard equipment, with optional anti-lock brakes. Color-keyed 15-inch alloy wheels were standard, with P205/60R15 tires.

At the time, the R/T was advertised as &quot;the fastest sedan made in America&quot;, and one of the quickest performance sedans under $40,000, with Chrysler placing its performance above the BMW M5. It could reach in 5.8 seconds, according to &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, making it one of the quickest front wheel drive cars ever offered in the American market. It was chosen as &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Domestic Sport Sedan of the Year&quot;, beating the Ford Taurus SHO for 1991 and 1992.

All R/Ts were built in Mexico. A total of 1,208 were sold in the U.S. in 1991 – 774 in red and 434 in white. An additional 191 were sold in the U.S. in 1992 – 92 red, 68 white, and 31 silver. The only discernible changes for 1992 were a lower first gear ratio for reduced turbo lag, woodgrain dashboard trim as used on the Chrysler LeBaron sedan, blacked-out upper and lower grille inserts, clear rather than amber lenses for the front parking and turn signal lights, and a speedometer calibrated to rather than .
==Mexican and South American markets==
Spirits were marketed in Mexico. They were badged as Chryslers rather than Dodges, since the Dodge brand at the time was used only on trucks. The Spirit was introduced in the Mexican market for 1990, one year after its début in the U.S. and Canada. The 1990-1991 Mexican versions were equipped with the U.S. market Plymouth Acclaim tail lights. The initial 1990-model Spirits used a version of the 2.5 L engine operating on leaded gasoline, equipped with a carburetor, a tubular exhaust header, and electronic control of ignition timing. This induction and ignition system used technology and components very similar to those employed in Chrysler&#x27;s U.S.-market Lean Burn emission control systems of the late-1970s.

For the 1991 model year, Mexico enacted new-vehicle emission regulations similar to those in the U.S. and Canada. The carbureted leaded-fuel engine was too dirty to comply with the new regulations, so a fully integrated engine management system with fuel injection was added to the Spirit. This was not the TBI system used in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Rather, the Mexican-market Spirits came with a more advanced MPFI setup. The MPFI 2.5 improved performance and driveability, as well as achieved cleaner emissions than its TBI counterpart, but was not used in the U.S., Canadian, or rest-of-world export markets except on turbocharged and FFV models. The Chrysler Spirit with MPFI 2.5 L engine was sold in Mexico from 1991 through 1995, and was exported to Argentina and Brazil from 1993 through 1995. It was employed by the Argentine police in Buenos Aires.
Chrysler de Mexico also sold two versions of the Spirit R/T. The base R/T, sold from 1991 through 1995, used a Mexico-only intercooled Turbo II version of the 8-valve SOHC 2.5 L engine and the 3-speed A413 automatic transmission. These R/Ts were used by Mexican police departments.

The top-line R/T. called &quot;R/T DOHC&quot;, available from 1992 through 1993, came with the same 2.2 L 16-valve DOHC engine that was used in the American-market from 1991 to 1992 R/T with a 5-speed manual transmission. More options and higher equipment levels were available in Mexico, including leather upholstery, sunroof, and 16-inch alloy wheels, none of which was offered on the R/T in America. In addition, Mexican-market R/Ts could be ordered in a variety of different colors, not just the red, white, and silver offered in the U.S. All Mexican-market Spirit R/Ts were badged as Chryslers. A variant of the R/T family, the Chrysler Phantom R/T, was a special-order Mexico-only premium version of the LeBaron coupe equipped with the 2.2 L 16-valve DOHC engine and the &quot;Getrag&quot; 5-speed manual transmission.

<doc id="622503" wikidata="Q417889" url="?curid=622503" title="Maturation promoting factor">
<text>Maturation-promoting factor (abbreviated MPF, also called mitosis-promoting factor or M-Phase-promoting factor) is the cyclin–Cdk complex that was discovered first in frog eggs. It stimulates the mitotic and meiotic phases of the cell cycle. MPF promotes the entrance into mitosis (the M phase) from the G2 phase by phosphorylating multiple proteins needed during mitosis. MPF is activated at the end of G2 by a phosphatase, which removes an inhibitory phosphate group added earlier.

The MPF is also called the M phase kinase because of its ability to phosphorylate target proteins at a specific point in the cell cycle and thus control their ability to function.

==Discovery==
In 1971, two independent teams of researchers (Yoshio Masui and Clement Markert, as well as L. Dennis Smith and Robert Ecker) found that frog oocytes arrested in G2 could be induced to enter M phase by microinjection of cytoplasm from oocytes that had been hormonally stimulated with progesterone. Because the entry of oocytes into meiosis is frequently referred to as oocyte maturation, this cytoplasmic factor was called maturation promoting factor (MPF). Further studies showed, however, that the activity of MPF is not restricted to the entry of oocytes into meiosis. To the contrary, MPF is also present in somatic cells, where it induces entry into M phase of the mitotic cycle.

Evidence that a diffusible factor regulates the entry into mitosis had been previously obtained in 1966 using the slime mold &quot;Physarum polycephalum&quot; in which the nuclei of the multi-nucleate plasmodial form undergo synchronous mitoses. Fusing plasmodia whose cell cycles were out of phase with each other led to a synchronous mitosis in the next mitotic cycle. This result demonstrated that mitotic entry was controlled by a diffusible cytoplasmic factor and not by a &quot;nuclear clock.&quot;

== Structure ==
MPF is composed of two subunits: 
* Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), the cyclin-dependent kinase subunit. It uses ATP to phosphorylate specific serine and threonine residues of target proteins. 
* Cyclin, a regulatory subunit. The cyclins are necessary for the kinase subunit to function with the appropriate substrate. The mitotic cyclins can be grouped as cyclins A &amp; B. These cyclins have a nine residue sequence in the N-terminal region called the “destruction box”, which can be recognized by the ubiquitin ligase enzyme which destroys the cyclins when appropriate.

==Role in the cell cycle==
During G1 and S phase, the CDK1 subunit of MPF is inactive due to an inhibitory enzyme, Wee1. Wee1 phosphorylates the Tyr-15 residue of CDK1, rendering MPF inactive. During the transition of G2 to M phase, cdk1 is de-phosphorylated by CDC25. The CDK1 subunit is now free and can bind to cyclin B, activate MPF, and make the cell enter mitosis. There is also a positive feedback loop that inactivates wee1. 

===Activation===
MPF must be activated in order for the cell to transition from G2 to M phase. There are three amino acid residues responsible for this G2 to M phase transition. The Threonine-161 (Thr-161) on CDK1 must be phosphorylated by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). CAK only phosphorylates Thr-161 when cyclin B is attached to CDK1.

In addition, two other residues on the CDK1 subunit must be activated by dephosphorylation. CDC25 removes a phosphate from residues Threonine-14 (Thr-14) and Tyrosine-15 (Tyr-15) and adds a hydroxyl group. Cyclin B/CDK1 activates CDC25 resulting in a positive feedback loop.

===Overview of functions===
* Triggers the formation of mitotic spindle through microtubule instability. 
* Promotes mitosis i.e. chromatin condensation through phosphorylation of condensins. 
* The three lamins present in the nuclear lamina, lamin A, B &amp; C, are phosphorylated by MPF at serine amino residues. This leads to depolymerisation of the nuclear lamina &amp; breakdown of nuclear envelope into small vesicles.
* Causes phosphorylation of GM130, which leads to the fragmentation of the Golgi and the ER.

===Targets===
The following are affected by MPF.
* condensins, which enable chromatin condensation (see prophase)
* various microtubule-associated proteins involved in mitotic spindle formation
* lamins, interaction contributing to degradation of the nuclear envelope
* Histones, H1 and H3
* Golgi matrix, to cause fragmentation

===Inhibition of myosin===
MPF phosphorylates inhibitory sites on myosin early in mitosis. This prevents cytokinesis. When MPF activity falls at anaphase, the inhibitory sites are dephosphorylated and cytokinesis proceeds.

===Disassembly by anaphase-promoting complex===
MPF is disassembled when anaphase-promoting complex (APC) polyubiquitinates cyclin B, marking it for degradation in a negative feedback loop. In intact cells, cyclin degradation begins shortly after the onset of anaphase (late anaphase), the period of mitosis when sister chromatids are separated and pulled toward opposite spindle poles. As the concentration of Cyclin B/CDK1 increases, the heterodimer promotes APC to polyubiquitinate Cyclin B/CDK1.

<doc id="622513" wikidata="Q1662406" url="?curid=622513" title="Infiniti J30">
<text>The Infiniti J30, marketed as the [[Nissan Leopard]] J Ferie in Japan, is a rear wheel drive luxury car. The J30 went into production on April 7, 1992 as a 1993 model to replace the M30 (which was a coupe), and was launched in the United States after its competitors, the Lexus GS and Acura Legend. The car was sold in the mid-size sedan segment between the smaller G20 and the larger Q45, both by size and price. The small interior resulted from its rounded styling uncharacteristic of the crowded executive car class, which is now considered an early variant of a four-door coupé.

==Design==
===Exterior styling===

The J30 was designed at Nissan Design International (NDI) in La Jolla, California under the direction of president Jerry Hirshberg and exterior designer Doug Wilson in 1988-1989. Hirshberg said it was &quot;the first car in what we see as a trend toward breaking away from the long tyranny of the wedge&quot;. Design work was frozen in 1989. In a promotional video produced in 1994, it was referred to as a &quot;personal luxury sedan&quot; as attempt to define it as a four-door coupé. The rounded styling resembles the contemporary Nissan Altima/Bluebird U13, also styled at NDI at approximately the same time..

Paul Dean, in a review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, likened the J30 to &quot;a 1961 Jaguar Mark X that melted&quot;, adding the &quot;styling magic ... has softened the bulk of a sedan into the visual delicacy of a coupe&quot;. Bob Sikorsky drew a parallel to the 1947 Studebaker Champion and was positive about his driving impression, calling the J30 &quot;one of the best-engineered cars in the world today ... a paragon of smoothness and silence with a remarkable balance between cornering ability and straight-ahead highway cruising&quot;. At the launch event, held at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, Hirshberg presented the design theme as &quot;a bold, calligraphic sketch of a line and an egg&quot; and noted it was an attempt to grant &quot;instant heritage&quot; to the nascent Infiniti brand. In a retrospective, Mickey Kaus derided the design as &quot;a pretentious fashion statement&quot; with a &quot;massively round, sagging rear end&quot; that was based &quot;on the bottom of a toilet bowl&quot;.

===Interior===
To establish that this was a luxury vehicle, the interior was largely designed with assistance from Poltrona Frau of Italy, whom they had previously worked with on the larger Q45. The J30 was packaged with a long list of standard features including (but not limited to) a leather interior; bronze tinted exterior glass; digital climate control; real burlwood trim surrounding the climate control unit, Bose sound system control module, and front ashtray; a power metal panel sunroof; dual 8-way power heated seats; dual airbags, variable speed sensitive power steering; and three-channel Anti-Lock brakes with ventilated discs front and rear.

The interior treatment continued to use the contrasting arrangement from the larger Q45 with a dark color used for the dashboard, and center console, with a lighter shade color used inside for the seats, interior door panels, headliner, carpet, and carpeted floor mats. The driver&#x27;s side window controls had an unusual placement in that the drivers window switch was both one-touch express down and double-sized, meaning it was the same width as two conventional window switches towards the top, with the front and rear passenger window switches further down, with the window lockout switch installed next to the front passenger switch, instead of the drivers window switch. The front passenger and rear passenger window switches were thumb activated, installed at the top of the interior door pull handle. Part of the design process included having designers smell interior materials to ensure &quot;it&#x27;s a total comprehensive experience when you get in this car&quot;, according to Hirshberg.

One of the shortcomings of the J30 was its lack of interior room. Despite its exterior mid-size car dimensions, the interior space was comparable to a subcompact; in fact, key interior dimensions were smaller than a Nissan Sentra, due to its sloping roofline and shrunken trunk.

===Mechanical===
Power came from a naturally-aspirated 3.0 L VG30DE V6, shared with the contemporary 300ZX (Z32), which produced and of torque as fitted to the J30. Performance was compromised compared to the 300ZX because of the reduced power and increased weight ( for the J30, approximately more than the 300ZX); as-tested in 1992, the car achieved a top speed of and accelerated from 0– in approximately 9 seconds. In addition, to achieve smoother shifts, the engine valve timing was retarded slightly. Fuel consumption was nearly the same as the larger Q45; Natural Resources Canada rated the J30 at City/Highway, compared with corresponding ratings for the Q45. The EPA rated the combined (mixed city and highway driving) fuel consumption of the J30 and Q45 at , respectively, for the 1993 model year.

It shares the Y32 Chassis with the Nissan Cedric/Cima/Gloria. The chassis used a MacPherson strut front suspension with a multi-link suspension for the rear wheels, equipped with a viscous limited-slip differential and an anti-lock braking system with ventilated disc brakes front and rear. The J30 was rebadged and marketed in Japan as the Leopard J. Ferie (for &quot;jour ferie&quot;, meaning &#x27;holiday&#x27; in French), where it was offered with both the VG30DE (as the Type L) and VH41DE V8 (Type X). With either engine, the Y32 was exclusively fitted with a four-speed automatic transmission.

===Touring model===

Infiniti also produced a touring model, the J30t. This model featured a rear spoiler, firmer suspension, BBS-style alloy wheels, and Super HICAS; Nissan&#x27;s four wheel steering technology. Super HICAS was only available in 1993 and 1994 J30t models. For 1993 and 1994, Nissan offered a very limited number of &quot;gold package&quot; J30t&#x27;s. These cars had gold plated badging, front grille, antenna and door handles; gold Infiniti logo BBS wheels, upgraded wood interior, and upgraded heated front leather seats with embossed logos. Starting with the 1995 model year, Infiniti &quot;decontented&quot; J30t models due to parent Nissan&#x27;s financial issues. They weren&#x27;t as luxurious as earlier models. The &quot;t&quot; model essentially became a base J30 with a spoiler.

==History==
In the United States, Infiniti unveiled the J30 in Chicago on February 5, 1992. By early March, prices were set at $30,000 and $34,700 for the 1993 model year J30 and J30t, respectively; there were no available options and the first cars were scheduled to be in dealer showrooms by the end of the month. The car launched at $33,000 for the base and $34,700 for the touring models; by 1995, the base model had risen to $39,000, and the J30t was $2,000 more.

The J30 remained nearly unchanged through its production period. Heated seats became standard equipment in the 1994 model year. For 1995, the J30 received subtle vertical ribbing in the tail light lenses, an automatically-dimming rear view mirror, and a power lumbar support control for the driver&#x27;s seat; in &#x27;96 the diagnostic system was upgraded to OBD-II. Otherwise, the J30 received only minor alterations between 1993 and 1997 model years.

All J30s were built in Tochigi, Tochigi, Japan. Over its lifetime, approximately 70,000 were sold in the United States (more than 20,000 per year for 1993 and 1994; 17,899 in 1995; 7,564 in 1996; and 4,594 in 1997) and less than 8,000 were sold in Japan. Production of the J30 ended on June 18, 1997, replaced by the Infiniti I30 (introduced in 1996).

==Marketing==
Unlike earlier Infinitis, the J30 received effective advertisement with jazz music and artistic camera shots. The J30 was launched with an ad campaign featuring Welsh actor Jonathan Pryce as the spokesman. Infiniti&#x27;s chief competitors in the Japanese-American luxury car market, Acura and Lexus, used a similar technique in their commercials, which have also featured celebrity voice-overs, done by James Sloyan (Lexus) and James Spader (Acura).

<text>The Pontiac 6000 is a mid-size automobile manufactured and marketed by Pontiac from the 1982 to 1991 model years. As Pontiac transitioned to a numeric model nomenclature in the early 1980s, the 6000 replaced the LeMans as the mid-size Pontiac, slotted between the Phoenix (later the Grand Am) and the Bonneville. Through its production life, the 6000 was offered as a two-door and four-door notchback sedan and as a five-door station wagon. 

The model line utilized the front-wheel drive GM A platform. Sharing a platform with the Buick Century, Chevrolet Celebrity (replacing the Malibu), and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera (replacing the Cutlass Supreme sedan), the 6000 shared its roofline with the Cutlass Ciera. The 6000 STE was a sport-tuned model unique to Pontiac; the STE was named to the Car and Driver Ten Best three times (from 1983 to 1985). Following the discontinuation of its full-size namesake, the 6000 Safari was the final Pontiac to use the nameplate, becoming the final Pontiac station wagon in 1991. 

For 1984, the 6000 became the highest-selling Pontiac line (with over 122,000 sold). As part of their legacy, together the 6000 and the other A-bodies became enormously popular — as well as synonymous with GM&#x27;s most transparent examples of badge engineering, highlighted almost indistinguishably on the August 22, 1983 cover of Fortune magazine as examples of genericized uniformity, embarrassing the company and ultimately prompting GM to recommit to design leadership. 

The 6000 was manufactured by GM at Oshawa Car Assembly (Oshawa, Ontario) from 1981 to 1988; subsequently, it was manufactured at Oklahoma City Assembly (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma). The 6000 was replaced for 1992 as Pontiac fully phased in the four-door sedan version of the Grand Prix (introduced in 1990) as a successor. 

==Year-to-year changes==


*1982: Two trim levels were offered: 6000 and 6000 LE. Both came standard with the new-for-1982 Tech IV four-cylinder with throttle body injection. It made . Optional engines were GM&#x27;s V6 with a 2-barrel carburetor which made , or a Oldsmobile diesel V6 which made .
*1984: A station wagon known as the 6000 Safari was introduced to replace the rear-wheel drive Bonneville Safari wagon.
*1985: A facelift meant a new fascia with a body-colored center section housing the Pontiac logo. The 2.8 in the STE model was updated with multi-port fuel injection, raising output to . The Tech IV was given various updates over the years but was mostly unchanged. The 4.3-liter diesel V6 was unpopular in light of General Motors diesel engine problems and was discontinued after 1985.
*1986: The fuel-injected 2.8 made its way into the Base and LE models for the 1986 model year, however in these trims, it only made . An S/E model arrived with the STE powertrain but with fewer features; it was also available as a station wagon.
*1987: The quad rectangular sealed beam headlamps were replaced with composite units. The taillights were updated with separate amber-colored turn signal indicators on the outboard side. 
*1988: The coupe model was dropped; the rest of the line received equipment changes such as new &quot;contour seats&quot; for the LE.
*1988: In Canada, an Olympic edition was offered on S/E models as a tie-in to the Calgary Winter Olympics. Offered only in monochrome white, with all blackout trim exterior painted white to match the body. The only interior colour trim was saddle, with an Olympic logo mounted on the B pillar.
*1989: The 6000 received a more-rounded roofline, along with the Buick Century and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, and was facelifted for the final time with slightly wider headlamps and a new grille. The taillights were replaced with the one from 6000STE.
*1990: Passive front seatbelts were introduced and the V6 originally only seen in the STE replaced the 2.8 across the board. After the STE model was dropped from the 6000 line for 1990, the S/E model gained its all wheel drive option. This was later dropped for the 1991 model year. 
*1991: The 6000 is dropped, being replaced by the Grand Prix sedan. In addition, the Pontiac 6000 wagon was the final GM designed station wagon offering from Pontiac, as it was replaced by the Pontiac Trans Sport in 1990. The last Pontiac 6000 was assembled on July 22, 1991.

==STE version==
By 1984, Pontiac was in the midst of a resurgence as the division began to reassert its 1960s role as GM&#x27;s performance brand. The 6000STE (Special Touring Edition) was introduced for the 1983 model year. 5-passenger seating with front captain seats and power windows were standard on this trim level (optional on some other trim levels). It featured a High-Output version of the 6000&#x27;s optional 2.8 L V6. Like that engine, it sported a 2-barrel carburetor, though it delivered , rather than the usual 112 horsepower. Although intended to compete with similar entries from BMW, Audi, Toyota and Nissan, the 6000 used older technologies by comparison. The fuel system was carbureted (competitors had fuel injection) and gauge cluster lacked a tachometer. The 1984 6000STE featured a digital gauge cluster featuring a bar-graph tachometer. The STE featured a driver information center with a system which monitored functions such as lights, doors, tune-ups and tire rotations. For 1984, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; called the 6000 STE one of the top twelve enthusiast cars.

Special steering rack, and suspension tuning with a self-leveling rear air suspension yielded handling performance comparable to European vehicles. Four wheel disc brakes improved stopping as did standard Goodyear Eagle GT tires, size 195/70R14 (large for the time).

In 1985, the carbureted engine was replaced by a multi-port fuel injected version of the 2.8 L V6, still delivering . Although the 3-speed automatic remained standard (a Getrag 5-speed manual was a no charge option), the new engine accelerated faster than the previous engine.

For 1986, a revised front fascia with composite headlamps, anti-lock brakes, a revised tachometer, steering wheel mounted audio controls (the first of their kind) and a new 4-speed automatic transmission became available. Following this was a two-position memory seat for the 8-way power drivers seat for 1987. New for 1988 was an optional All Wheel Drive system. It was mated to a new 3.1 L LH0 V6 (the first use of GM&#x27;s then-new 3.1 L in a production car) but only a 3-speed automatic transmission, which did not help acceleration or fuel economy. The all-wheel-drive system became standard for 1989, but was moved to the SE model for 1990, since the STE model name was discontinued from the 6000 line and moved to the new four-door Grand Prix lineup that year. The STE trim level was later discontinued from the Grand Prix after 1993.

<doc id="622529" wikidata="Q1094228" url="?curid=622529" title="Logical atomism">
<text>Logical atomism is a philosophical view that originated in the early 20th century with the development of analytic philosophy. It holds that the world consists of ultimate logical &quot;facts&quot; (or &quot;atoms&quot;) that cannot be broken down any further, each of which can be understood independently of other facts.

Its principal exponent was the British philosopher Bertrand Russell. It is also widely held that the early works of his Austrian-born pupil and colleague, Ludwig Wittgenstein, defend a version of logical atomism, though he went on to reject it in his later &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;. Some philosophers in the Vienna Circle were also influenced by logical atomism (particularly Rudolf Carnap, who was deeply sympathetic to some of its philosophical aims, especially in his earlier works). Gustav Bergmann also developed a form of logical atomism that focused on an ideal phenomenalistic language, particularly in his discussions of J.O. Urmson&#x27;s work on analysis.

The name for this kind of theory was coined in March 1911 by Russell, in a work published in French titled &quot;Le Réalisme analytique&quot; (published in translation as &quot;Analytic Realism&quot; in Volume 6 of &quot;The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell&quot;). Russell was developing and responding to what he called &quot;logical holism&quot;—i.e., the belief that the world operates in such a way that no part can be known without the whole being known first. This belief is related to monism, and is associated with the absolute idealism which was dominant in Britain at the time. The criticism of monism seen in the works of Russell and his colleague G. E. Moore can therefore be seen as an extension of their criticism of absolute idealism, particularly as it appeared in the works of F. H. Bradley and J. M. E. McTaggart. Logical atomism can thus be understood as a developed alternative to logical holism, or the &quot;monistic logic&quot; of the absolute idealists.

== Origin ==

As mentioned above, the term &quot;logical atomism&quot; was first coined by Russell in 1911. However, since the paper in which it was first introduced was published only in French during Russell&#x27;s lifetime, the view was not widely associated with Russell in the English-speaking world until Russell gave a series of lectures in early 1918 under the title &quot;The Philosophy of Logical Atomism&quot;. These lectures were subsequently published in 1918 and 1919 in &quot;The Monist&quot; (Volumes 28 and 29), which at the time was edited by Phillip Jourdain. Russell&#x27;s ideas as presented in 1918 were also influenced by Wittgenstein, as he explicitly acknowledges in his introductory note. This has partly contributed to the widely-held view that Wittgenstein was also a logical atomist, as has Wittgenstein&#x27;s atomistic metaphysics developed in the &quot;Tractatus&quot;.

However, logical atomism has older roots. Russell and Moore broke themselves free from British Idealism in the 1890s. And Russell&#x27;s break developed along its own logical and mathematical path. His views on philosophy and its methods were heavily influenced by revolutionary nineteenth-century mathematics by figures like Cantor, Dedekind, Peano, and Weierstrass. As he says in his 1901 essay, republished in his 1917 collection &quot;Mysticism and Logic, and Other Essays&quot; under the title &quot;Mathematics and the Metaphysicians&quot;:What is now required is to give the greatest possible development to mathematical logic, to allow to the full the importance of relations, and then to found upon this secure basis a new philosophical logic, which may hope to borrow some of the exactitude and certainty of its mathematical foundation. If this can be successfully accomplished, there is every reason to hope that the near future will be as great an epoch in pure philosophy as the immediate past has been in the principles of mathematics. Great triumphs inspire great hopes; and pure thought may achieve, within our generation, such results as will place our time, in this respect, on a level with the greatest age of Greece. (pg. 96)
With the operations of the calculus of relations as atoms or indefinables (primitive notions), Russell described logicism, or mathematics as logic, in &quot;The Principles of Mathematics&quot; (1903). Russell thought the revolutionary mathematical work could, through the development of relations, produce a similar revolution in philosophy. This ambition overlays the character of Russell&#x27;s work from 1900 onward. Russell believes in fact that logical atomism, fully carried out and implemented throughout philosophy, is the realization of his 1901 ambition. As he says in the 1911 piece where he coins the phrase &quot;logical atomism&quot;:The true method, in philosophy as in science, should be inductive, meticulous, respectful of detail, and should reject the belief that it is the duty of each philosophy to solve all problems by himself. It is this method which has inspired analytic realism [a.k.a. logical atomism], and it is the only method, if I am not mistaken, with which philosophy will succeed in obtaining results as solid as those obtained in science. (pg. 139)Logical atomism rightly makes logic central to philosophy. In doing so, it makes philosophy scientific, at least in Russell&#x27;s view. As he says in his 1924 &quot;Logical Atomism&quot;:The technical methods of mathematical logic, as developed in this book [&quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;], seem to me very powerful, and capable of providing a new instrument for the discussion of many problems that have hitherto remained subject to philosophical vagueness.In summary, Russell thought that a moral of the revolutionary work in mathematics was this: equally revolutionary work in philosophy could occur, if we only make logic the essence of philosophizing. This aspiration lies at the origin, and motivates and runs through, logical atomism.

== Principles ==

Russell referred to his atomistic doctrine as contrary to the tier &quot;of the people who more or less follow Hegel&quot; (PLA 178).

The first principle of logical atomism is that the World contains &quot;facts&quot;. The facts are complex structures consisting of objects (&quot;particulars&quot;). A fact may be that an object has a property or that it stands in some relation to other objects. In addition, there are judgments (&quot;beliefs&quot;), which are in a relationship to the facts, and by this relationship either true or false.

According to this theory, even ordinary objects of daily life &quot;are apparently complex entities&quot;. According to Russell, words like &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot; are used to denote particulars. In contrast, ordinary names such as &quot;Socrates&quot; actually are definitive descriptions. In the analysis of &quot;Plato talks with his pupils&quot;, &quot;Plato&quot; needs to be replaced with something like &quot;the man who was the teacher of Aristotle&quot;.

In 1905, Russell had already criticized Alexius Meinong, whose theories led to the paradox of the simultaneous existence and non-existence of fictional objects. This theory of descriptions was crucial to logical atomism, as Russell believed that language mirrored reality.

=== Russell&#x27;s principles ===

Bertrand Russell&#x27;s theory of logical atomism consists of three interworking parts: the atomic proposition, the atomic fact, and the atomic complex. An atomic proposition, also known as an elemental judgement, is a fundamental statement describing a single entity. Russell refers to this entity as an atomic fact, and recognizes a range of elements within each fact that he refers to as particulars and universals. A particular denotes a signifier such as a name, many of which may apply to a single atomic fact, while a universal lends quality to these particulars, e.g. color, shape, disposition. In Russell&#x27;s Theory of Acquaintance, awareness and thereby knowledge of these particulars and universals comes through sense data. Every system consists of many atomic propositions and their corresponding atomic facts, known together as an atomic complex. In respect to the nomenclature that Russell used for his theory, these complexes are also known as molecular facts in that they possess multiple atoms. Rather than decoding the complex in a top-down manner, logical atomism analyzes its propositions individually before considering their collective effect. According to Russell, the atomic complex is a product of human thought and ideation that combines the various atomic facts in a logical manner.

Russell&#x27;s perspective on belief proved a point of contention between him and Wittgenstein, causing it to shift throughout his career. In logical atomism, belief is a complex that possesses both true and untrue propositions. Initially, Russell plotted belief as the special relationship between a subject and a complex proposition. Later, he amended this to say that belief lacks a proposition, and instead associates with universals and particulars directly. Here, the link between psychological experience – sense data – and components of logical atomism – universals and particulars – causes a breach in the typical logic of the theory; Russell&#x27;s logical atomism is in some respects defined by the crossover of metaphysics and analytical philosophy, which characterizes the field of naturalized epistemology.

In his theory of Logical Atomism, Russell posited the highly controversial idea that for every positive fact exists a parallel negative fact: a fact that is untrue. The correspondence theory maintains that every atomic proposition coordinates with exactly one atomic fact, and that all atomic facts exist. The Theory of Acquaintance says that for any given statement taking the form of an atomic proposition, we must be familiar with the assertion it makes. For example, in the positive statement, &quot;the leaf is green,&quot; we must be acquainted with the atomic fact that the leaf is green, and we know that this statement corresponds to exactly this one fact. Along this same line, the complementary negative statement, &quot;the leaf is not green,&quot; is clearly false given what we know about the color of the leaf, but our ability to form a statement of this nature means that a corresponding fact must exist. Regardless of whether the second statement is or isn&#x27;t true, the connection between its proposition and a fact must itself be true. One central doctrine of Logical Atomism, known as the Logically Perfect Language Principle, enables this conclusion. This principle establishes that everything exists as atomic proposition and fact, and that all language signifies reality. In Russell&#x27;s viewpoint, this necessitates the negative fact, whereas Wittgenstein maintained the more conventional Principle of Bivalence, in which the states &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Not (P)&quot; cannot coexist.

=== Wittgenstein&#x27;s principles ===

In his &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot;, Ludwig Wittgenstein explains his version of logical atomism as the relationship between proposition, state of affairs, object, and complex, often referred to as &quot;Picture theory&quot;. In view of Russell&#x27;s version, the propositions are congruent in that they are both clear statements about an atomic entity. Every atomic proposition is constructed from &quot;names&quot; that correspond to &quot;objects&quot;, and the interaction of these objects generates &quot;states of affairs,&quot; which are analogous to what Russell called atomic facts. Where Russell identifies both particulars and universals, Wittgenstein amalgamates these into objects for the sake of protecting the truth-independence of his propositions; a self-contained state of affairs defines each proposition, and the truth of a proposition cannot be proven by the sharing or exclusion of objects between propositions. In Russell&#x27;s work, his concept of universals and particulars denies truth-independence, as each universal accounts for a specific set of particulars, and the exact matching of any two sets implies equality, difference implies inequality, and this acts as a qualifier of truth. In Wittgenstein&#x27;s theory, an atomic complex is a layered proposition subsuming many atomic propositions, each representing its own state of affairs.

Wittgenstein&#x27;s handling of belief was dismissive and reflects his abstention from the epistemology that concerned Russell. Because his theory dealt with understanding the nature of reality, and because any item or process of the mind barring positive fact, i.e. something absolute and without interpretation, may become altered and thus divorced from reality, belief exists as a sign of reality but not reality itself. Wittgenstein was decidedly skeptical of epistemology, which tends to value unifying metaphysical ideas while depreciating the casewise and methodological inspection of philosophy that dominates his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. Furthermore, Wittgenstein concerned himself with defining the exact correspondence between language and reality wherein any explanation of reality that defies or overburdens these semantic structures, namely metaphysics, becomes unhinged. Wittgenstein&#x27;s work bears the exact philosophical determinants that he openly dismissed, hence his later abandonment of this theory altogether.

=== Differences between Russell&#x27;s and Wittgenstein&#x27;s atomism ===

At the time Russell delivered his lectures on logical atomism, he had lost contact with Wittgenstein. After World War I, Russell met with Wittgenstein again and helped him publish the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, Wittgenstein&#x27;s own version of Logical Atomism.

Although Wittgenstein did not use the expression &quot;Logical Atomism&quot;, the book espouses most of Russell&#x27;s logical atomism except for Russell&#x27;s Theory of Knowledge (T 5.4 and 5.5541). By 1918 Russell had moved away from this position. Nevertheless, the &quot;Tractatus&quot; differed so fundamentally from the philosophy of Russell that Wittgenstein always believed that Russell misunderstood the work.

The differences relate to many details, but the crucial difference is in a fundamentally different understanding of the task of philosophy. Wittgenstein believed that the task of philosophy was to clean up linguistic mistakes. Russell was ultimately concerned with establishing sound epistemological foundations. Epistemological questions such as how practical knowledge is possible did not interest Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein investigated the &quot;limits of the world&quot; and later on meaning. For Wittgenstein, metaphysics and ethics were nonsensical - as they did not &quot;speak of facts&quot; - though he did not mean to devalue their importance in life by describing them in this way. Russell, on the other hand, believed that these subjects, particularly ethics, though belonging not to philosophy nor science and possessing an inferior epistemological foundation, were not only of certain interest, but also meaningful.

== Influence and decline ==
The immediate effect of the &quot;Tractatus&quot; was enormous, particularly by the reception it received by the Vienna Circle. However, it is now claimed by many contemporary analytic philosophers, that the Vienna Circle misunderstood certain sections of the &quot;Tractatus&quot;. The indirect effect of the method, however, was perhaps even greater long-term, especially on logical positivism. Wittgenstein eventually rejected the &quot;atomism&quot; of logical atomism in his posthumously published book, &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;, and it is still debated whether or not he ever held the wide-ranging version that Russell expounded in his 1918 logical atomism lectures. Russell, on the other hand, never abandoned logical atomism. In his 1959 &quot;My Philosophical Development&quot;, Russell said that his philosophy evolved and changed many times in his life, but he described all these changes as an &quot;evolution&quot; stemming from his original &quot;revolution&quot; into logical atomism in 1899-1900: There is one major division in my philosophical work: in the years 1899-1900, I adopted the philosophy of logical atomism and the technique of Peano in mathematical logic. This was so great a revolution as to make my previous work, except such as was purely mathematical, irrelevant to everything that I did later. The change in these years was a revolution; subsequent changes have been of the nature of an evolution. (Chapter 1: &quot;Introductory Outline&quot;)Even into the 1960s, Russell claimed that he &quot;rather avoided labels&quot; in describing his views—with the exception of &quot;logical atomism.&quot;

Philosophers such as Willard Van Orman Quine, Hubert Dreyfus and Richard Rorty went on to adopt logical holism.

<doc id="622532" wikidata="Q1145682" url="?curid=622532" title="Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising">
<text>The Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising, or simply the Ilinden Uprising, of August–October 1903 (; ; ), was an organized revolt against the Ottoman Empire, which was prepared and carried out by the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization, with the support of the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee, which included mostly Bulgarian military personnel. The name of the uprising refers to &quot;Ilinden&quot;, a name for Elijah&#x27;s day, and to &quot;Preobrazhenie&quot; which means Feast of the Transfiguration. Some historians describe the rebellion in the Serres revolutionary district as a separate uprising, calling it the Krastovden Uprising (Holy Cross Day Uprising), because on September 14 the revolutionaries there also rebelled. The revolt lasted from the beginning of August to the end of October and covered a vast territory from the western Black Sea coast in the east to the shores of Lake Ohrid in the west.

The rebellion in the region of Macedonia affected most of the central and southwestern parts of the Monastir Vilayet, supported by Macedonian Bulgarian revolutionaries, and to some extent of the Aromanian population of the region; Provisional government was established in the town of Kruševo, where the insurgents proclaimed the &quot;Kruševo Republic&quot;, which was overrun after just ten days, on August 12. On August 19, a closely related uprising organized by Thracian Bulgarian revolutionaries in the Adrianople Vilayet led to the liberation of a large area in the Strandzha Mountains, and the creation of a provisional government in Vassiliko, the &quot;Strandzha Republic&quot;. This lasted about twenty days before being put down by the Turks. The insurrection also affected the vilayets of Kosovo and Salonika. In practice, this uprising was designed as a belated replica of the Bulgarian April Uprising of 1876, which finished disastrous, but which the national narrative had transformed into culmination of the anti-Ottoman struggle.

By the time the rebellion had started, many of its most promising potential leaders, including Ivan Garvanov and Gotse Delchev, had already been arrested or killed by the Ottomans. The rebellion was supported by armed detachments which had infiltrated its area from the territory of the Principality of Bulgaria. When the rising began there were attempts to force the Bulgarian government to send the army against the Ottomans. The rebels appealed to Sofia for help too, but the government was pressured by the Great Powers to refrain from military intervention. The revolutionaries managed to maintain a guerrilla campaign against the Turks for the next few months, but the rising was crushed. This was followed by a mass wave of refugees from the areas of Macedonia and Southern Thrace, mostly to Bulgaria, but also to the US and Canada. Its greater effect was that it persuaded the European powers to attempt to convince the Ottoman sultan that he must take a more conciliatory attitude toward his Christian subjects in Europe. Through bilateral agreement, signed in 1904, Bulgaria committed not to support the revolutionary movement, while the Ottomans undertook to implement the Mürzsteg Reforms, however neither happened. 

The uprising is celebrated today in both Bulgaria and North Macedonia as the peak of their nations’ struggle against the Ottoman rule and thus it is still a divisive issue. While in Bulgaria it is considered as a general rebellion prepared by the joint revolutionary organization of the Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire, with a common goal autonomy for Macedonia and Adrianople regions, in North Macedonia it is assumed that there were in fact two separate uprisings. Despite being organized by a single body, they were carried out by two different peoples with diverse goals, and practically the &quot;Macedonians&quot; were striving for their independence. Although the ideas of a separate Macedonian nation were supported then only by a handful of intellectuals abroad, and to the eve of the 20th century the membership of the IMARO was allowed only for Bulgarians, the post-WWII Macedonian rendition of history has reappraised the Ilinden uprising as an allegedly anti-Bulgarian revolt, led by ethnic Macedonians. The leader of the IMARO and architect of the uprising Ivan Garvanov, is regarded there a Greater Bulgarian agent. Bulgarian military personnels&#x27; significant participation is represented there as an alien element, while the fact the Uprising&#x27;s leaders were Bulgarian schoolmasters, is neglected. Recent calls for common celebrations, especially from the Bulgarian side, did little to change this state of affairs.

==Prelude==

At the turn of the 20th century, the Ottoman Empire was crumbling, and the lands they had held in Eastern Europe for over 500 years were passing to new rulers. Macedonia and Thrace were regions of indefinite boundaries, adjacent to the recently independent Greek, Bulgarian and Serbian states, but themselves still under the control of the Ottoman Turks. Each of the neighbouring states based claims to Macedonia and Thrace on various historical and demographic grounds. The population, however, was highly mixed, and the competing historical claims were based on various empires in the distant past.
The competition for control took place largely via of propaganda campaigns, aimed at winning over the local population, and conducted largely through churches and schools. Various groups of mercenaries were also supported by the local population and the three competing governments.

The most effective group was the Internal Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Revolutionary Organization (IMARO), founded in Thessaloniki in 1893. The group had a number of name changes prior to and subsequent to the uprising. It was predominantly Bulgarian and supported an idea for autonomy for Macedonia and Adrianople regions within the Ottoman state with a motto of &quot;Macedonia for the Macedonians&quot;. It rapidly began to be infiltrated by members of Macedonian Supreme Committee, a group formed in 1894 in Sofia, Bulgaria. This group was called the &quot;Supremists&quot;, and advocated annexation of the region by Bulgaria.

Its inspiration certainly belonged to the nineteenth-century Balkan practice whereby the powers maintained the fiction of Ottoman control over effectively independent states under the guise of autonomous status within the Ottoman state; (Serbia, 1829–1878; Romania, 1829–1878; Bulgaria, 1878–1908). &quot;Autonomy, in other words, was as good as independence.&quot; Moreover, from the Macedonian perspective, the goal of independence by autonomy had another advantage. More important, IMARO was aware that neither Serbia nor Greece could expect to obtain the whole of Macedonia and, unlike Bulgaria, they both looked forward to and urged partition. Autonomy, then, was the best prophylactic against partition, that would preserve the Bulgarian character of Christian Macedonian Slav population despite the separation from Bulgaria proper. The idea of Macedonian autonomy was strictly political and did not imply a secession from Bulgarian ethnicity.
The two groups had different strategies. IMARO as originally conceived sought to prepare a carefully planned uprising in the future, but the Supremacists preferred immediate raids and guerilla operations to foster disorder and a precipitate interventions. On the other hand, a smaller group of conservatives in Salonica organized a Bulgarian Secret Revolutionary Brotherhood (&quot;Balgarsko Tayno Revolyutsionno Bratstvo&quot;). The latter was incorporated in IMARO by 1902 but its members as Ivan Garvanov, were to exert a significant influence on the organization. They were to push for the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising and later became the core of IMRO right-wing faction. One of the founding leaders of IMARO, Gotse Delchev, was a strong advocate for proceeding slowly, but the Supremacists pressed for a major uprising to take place in the summer of 1903. Delchev himself was killed by the Turks in May 1903.

Meanwhile, in late April 1903, a group of young anarchists from the &quot;Gemidzhii Circle&quot; – graduates from the Bulgarian Men&#x27;s High School of Thessaloniki launched a campaign of terror bombing, the so-called &quot;Thessaloniki bombings of 1903&quot;. Their aim was to attract the attention of the Great Powers to Ottoman oppression in Macedonia and Eastern Thrace. As a response to the attacks, the Turkish Army and &quot;bashibozouks&quot; (irregulars) massacred many innocent Bulgarians in Thessaloniki, and later in Bitola.
By these circumstances the Supremacists&#x27; plan went ahead. Under a leadership from Ivan Garvanov IMARO made a decision about military revolt. Garvanov, himself, did not participate in the uprising, because of his arrest and exile in Rhodes. The day chosen for the uprising was August 2 (July 20 in the old Julian calendar), the feast day of St. Elias (Elijah). This holy day was known as &quot;Ilinden&quot;. On 11 July, a congress at &quot;Petrova Niva&quot; near Malko Tarnovo set the date of 23 July for the uprising, then deferred it a bit more to 2 August. The Thrace region, around the Adrianople Vilayet was not ready, and negotiated for a later uprising in that region.

During the discussions, Racho Petrov&#x27;s Bulgarian government supported IMARO&#x27;s position that the rebellion was entirely internal. As well as Petrov&#x27;s personal warning to Gotse Delchev in January 1903 to delay or even cancel the rebellion, the government sent out a circular note to its diplomatic representatives in Thessaloniki, Bitola and Edirne, advising the population not to succumb to pro-rebellion propaganda, as &quot;Bulgaria was not ready to support it&quot;.

Old Russian Berdan and Krnka rifles as well as Mannlichers were supplied from Bulgaria to Skopje following the demand for higher rates of fire by Bulgarian army officer Boris Sarafov. In his memoir, Sarafov states that the main source of funds for the purchase of the weapons from the Bulgarian army came from the kidnapping of Miss Stone as well as from contacts in Europe.

==Ilinden Uprising==

An account of the dates and details of the uprising were recorded by the anarchist author Georgi Khadzhiev which was translated by Will Firth. On 28 July, the message was sent out to the revolutionary movements, though the secret was kept until the last moment. The uprising began on the night of August 2, and involved large regions in and around Bitola, around the south-west of what is now North Macedonia and some of the north of Greece. That night and early the next morning, the town of Kruševo was attacked and captured by 800 rebels. Concurrently, after three days of fighting followed by a siege starting on August 5, the town of Smilevo was captured by the rebels. The town of Kleisoura, near Kastoria, was taken by insurgents about August 5. On August 14, under the leadership of Nikola Pushkarov, some bands near Skopje attacked and derailed a military train. In Razlog the population joined in the uprising. This was further east, in Pirin Macedonia in present-day Bulgaria.

On August 4, under leadership of Nikola Karev, a local administration called &quot;Kruševo republic&quot; had been set up. That same day and the next, Turkish troops made unsuccessful attempts to retake Kruševo. On August 12, following the Battle of Sliva, a force of 3,500 Ottoman soldiers recaptured and burned Kruševo. It had been held by the insurgents for just ten days. Kleisoura was finally recaptured by the Ottomans on August 27.

Other regions involved included Ohrid, Florina, and Kičevo. In the Thessaloniki region, operations were much more limited and without much local involvement, due in part to disagreements between the factions of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO). There was also no uprising in the Prilep area, immediately to the east of Bitola.

The reason why the uprising was strategically chosen in the Bitola vilayet, and the broader southwestern region of Macedonia, was due to the fact that it was located the farthest from Bulgaria, attempting to showcase to the Great Powers that the uprising was purely of a Macedonian character and phenomenon. Per one of the founders of IMARO – Petar Poparsov the idea to keep distance from Bulgaria, was because any suspicion of its interference could harm both sides: Bulgaria and the organisation. In fact the uprising soon spread to the adjacent vilayets of Kosovo, Thessaloniki and Adrianople (in Thrace).

===Krastovden Uprising===
* Militias active in the region of Serres, led by Yane Sandanski and an insurgent detachment of the Supreme Committee, held down a large Turkish force. These actions began on the day of the Feast of the Cross (Krastovden in Bulgarian, September 27) and did not involve the local population as much as in other regions, and were well to the east of Monastir and to the west of Thrace.

In areas encompassing the uprising of 1903, Albanian villagers were in a situation of being either under threat from IMRO četas or recruited by Ottoman authorities to end the uprising.

==Preobrazhenie Uprising==
According to Khadzhiev, the main goal of the uprising in Thrace was to give support to the uprisings further west, by engaging Turkish troops and preventing them from moving into Macedonia. Many of the operations were diversionary, though several villages were taken, and a region in Strandzha was held for around twenty days. This is sometimes called the Strandzha Republic or Strandzha Commune, but according to Khadzhiev &quot;there was never a question of state power in the Thrace region.&quot;
* On the morning of August 19, 1903, attacks were made on villages throughout the region, including Vasiliko (now Tsarevo), Stoilovo (near Malko Tarnovo), and villages near Edirne.
* On August 21, the harbor lighthouse at Igneada was blown up.
* Around September 3 a strong Ottoman force began reasserting their control.
* By September 8 the Turks had restored control and were mopping up.

===Rhodope Mountains Uprising===
In the Rhodope Mountains, Western Thrace, the uprising expressed only in some cheta&#x27;s diversions in the regions of Smolyan and Dedeagach.

==Aftermath==
The reaction of the Ottoman Turks to the uprisings was one of overwhelming force. The only hope for the insurgents was outside intervention, and that was never politically feasible. Indeed, although Bulgarian interests were favoured by the actions, the Bulgarian government itself had been required to outlaw the Macedonian rebel groups prior to the uprisings and sought the arrest of its leaders. This was a condition of diplomacy with Russia. The waning Ottoman Empire dealt with the instability by taking vengeance on local populations that had supported the rebels. Casualties during the military campaigns themselves were comparatively small, but afterward, thousands were killed, executed or made homeless. Historian Barbara Jelavich estimates that about nine thousand homes were destroyed, and thousands of refugees were produced. According to Georgi Khadzhiev, 201 villages and 12,400 houses were burned, 4,694 people killed, with some 30,000 refugees fleeing to Bulgaria.
On September 29, the General staff of the Uprising sent the Letter N 534 to the Bulgarian government, appealing for immediate armed intervention: 
&quot;The General staff considers its duty to turn the attention of the respectable Bulgarian government to the disastrous consequences for the Bulgarian nation, if it does not carry out its duty towards its birth brothers here, in an impressive and active manner, as imposed by the power of the circumstances and the danger, which threatens the all-Bulgarian fatherland – through war.&quot;
Still, Bulgaria was unable to send troops to the rescue of the rebelling fellow Bulgarians in Macedonia and Adrianople, Thrace. When IMARO representatives met the Bulgarian Prime-Minister Racho Petrov, he showed them the ultimatums by Serbia, Greece and Romania, which he had just received and which informed him of those countries&#x27; support for Turkey, in case Bulgaria intervened to support the rebels.
At a meeting in early October, the general staff of the rebel forces decided to cease all revolutionary activities, and declared the forces, excepting regular militias, to be disbanded. After the uprising, IMARO became more strongly associated with the Supremacists, and with the goal of hegemony by Bulgaria.
The savagery of the insurrections and the reprisals did finally provoke a reaction from the outside world. In October, Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary and Nicholas II of Russia met at Mürzsteg and sponsored the Mürzsteg program of reforms, which provided for foreign policing of the Macedonia region, financial compensation for victims, and establishment of ethnic boundaries in the region. The reforms achieved little practical result apart from giving more visibility to the crisis. The question of competing aspirations of Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, and local advocates for political autonomy were not addressed, and the notion of ethnic boundaries was impossible to implement effectively. In any case, these concerns were soon overshadowed by the Young Turk revolution of 1908 and the subsequent dissolution of the Ottoman Empire.

==Subsequent history==

The Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 subsequently split up Macedonia and Thrace. Serbia took a portion of Macedonia in the north, which roughly corresponds to North Macedonia. Greece took south Macedonia, and Bulgaria was only able to obtain a small region in the northeast, Pirin Macedonia. The Ottomans managed to keep the Adrianople region, where the whole Thracian Bulgarian population was subjected to ethnic cleansing by the Ottoman Empire. The rest of Thrace was divided between Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey following World War I and the Greco-Turkish War. Most of the local Bulgarian political and cultural figures were persecuted or expelled from Serbian and Greek parts of Macedonia and Thrace, where all structures of the Bulgarian Exarchate were abolished. Thousands of Macedonian Slavs left for Bulgaria. Some fled after the Greeks burned Kilkis, during the Second Balkan War, and the Treaty of Neuilly population exchange between Greece and Bulgaria saw 92,000 Bulgarians exchanged with 46,000 Greeks from Bulgaria. Bulgarian (including the Macedonian dialects) was prohibited, and its surreptitious use, whenever detected, was ridiculed or punished.

The Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization supported the Bulgarian Army during the Balkan Wars and World War I. After the Treaty of Neuilly, the combined Macedonian-Adrianopolitan revolutionary movement separated into two detached organizations: Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation and Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation and continued its struggle against Serbian and Greek authorities until 1934.

IMRO had &quot;de facto&quot; full control of Bulgarian Pirin Macedonia (the Petrich District of the time) and acted as a &quot;state within a state&quot;, which it used as a base for hit and run attacks against Yugoslavia and Greece. IMRO began sending armed bands called &quot;cheti&quot; into Greek and Yugoslav Macedonia to assassinate officials and stir up the spirit of the oppressed population.

At the end of 1922, the Greek government started to expel large numbers of Bulgarians from Western Thrace into Bulgaria and the activity of the Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organization (ITRO) grew into an open rebellion. The organisation eventually gained full control of some districts along the Bulgarian border. In the summer of 1923, the majority of the Bulgarians had already been resettled to Bulgaria. Although detachments of the ITRO continued to infiltrate Western Thrace sporadically, the main focus of the activity of the organisation now shifted to the protection of the refugees into Bulgaria. IMRO&#x27;s and ITRO&#x27;s constant killings and assassinations abroad provoked some within Bulgarian military after the coup of 19 May 1934 to take control and break the power of the organizations.

==Legacy==

Portrayals of the insurrections by later historians often reflect ongoing national aspirations. Historians from North Macedonia see them as a part of the move for an independent state as finally achieved by their own new nation. There is, in fact, very little historical continuity from the insurrections to the modern state, but Macedonian sources tend to emphasize the early goals of political autonomy when IMARO was established. The Supremacist faction pushed for the insurrections to take place in the summer of 1903, while the left wing argued for more time and more planning. Historians from Bulgaria emphasize the undoubted Bulgarian character of the rebels, but tends to downplay the moves for political autonomy that were a part of the IMARO organization prior to the insurrections. Western historians generally refer simply to the &quot;Ilinden uprising&quot;, which marks the date on which uprising began. In Bulgaria it is more common to refer to the &quot;Ilinden-Preobrazhenie uprising&quot;, giving equal status to the activities commenced at Preobrazhenie near to the Bulgarian coast of the Black Sea and limiting an undue focus on the Macedonian region. Some sources recognize these as two related but distinct insurrections, and name them the &quot;Ilinden uprising&quot; and the &quot;Preobrazhenie uprising&quot;. Bulgarian sources tend to emphasize the moves within IMARO for hegemony with Bulgaria, as advocated by the Supremacist and the right wing factions.

The Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising was celebrated by the Macedonian and Thracian diaspora in Bulgaria and by all factions within the IMARO. It was commemorated officially in Macedonia under Bulgarian rule when it occupied then &quot;South Serbia&quot; during World War I and World War II. Celebrations occurred also in 1939 and 1940 in defiance of the ban by Serb authorities. The leaders of the &quot;Ilinden uprising&quot; are today celebrated as heroes in modern-day North Macedonia. They are regarded as Macedonian patriots and as founders of the drive for Macedonian independence. The names of the IMARO revolutionaries like Gotse Delchev, Pitu Guli, Dame Gruev and Yane Sandanski were included into the lyrics of the anthem of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia Denes nad Makedonija (&quot;Today over Macedonia&quot;). There are towns named after the leaders in both Bulgaria and North Macedonia. Today, 2 August is the national holiday in North Macedonia, known as Day of the Republic, which considers it the date of its first statehood in modern times. It is also the date on which, in 1944, a People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia was proclaimed at ASNOM as a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The ASNOM event is now referred as the &#x27;Second Ilinden&#x27; in North Macedonia, though there is no direct link to the events of 1903. In Bulgaria Ilinden and Preobrazhenie days as anniversaries of the uprising are publicly celebrated on a local level, primarily in the Pirin Macedonia and Northern Thrace regions.

==Controversy==

There have been long-going disputes between parties in Bulgaria and North Macedonia about the ethnic affiliation of the insurgents. The opinion of most Macedonian historians and politicians is that Preobrazhenie uprising was a Bulgarian uprising, not related with the Ilinden one, which was organized by Macedonians. Nevertheless, some of the Macedonian historical scholarship and political élite have reluctantly acknowledged the Bulgarian ethnic character of the insurgents. Krste Misirkov, regarded nowadays in North Macedonia as one of the most prominent proponents of Macedonian nationalism of the early 20th century, states in his brochure &quot;On the Macedonian Matters&quot; (1903) that the uprising was supported and carried out primarily by that part of Macedonia&#x27;s Slavic population which had Bulgarian national identity.

The dominant view in Bulgaria is that at that time the Macedonian and Thracian Bulgarians predominated in all regions of the uprisings and that Macedonian ethnicity did still not exist. More, the first name of the IMRO was &quot;Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees&quot;. Initially its membership was restricted only for Bulgarians. It was active not only in Macedonia but also in Thrace. Since its early name emphasized the Bulgarian nature of the organization by linking the inhabitants of Thrace and Macedonia to Bulgaria, these facts are still difficult to be explained from the Macedonian historiography. They suggest that IMRO revolutionaries in the Ottoman period did not differentiate between &#x27;Macedonians&#x27; and &#x27;Bulgarians&#x27;. Moreover, as their own writings attest, they often saw themselves and their compatriots as &#x27;Bulgarians&#x27; and wrote in Bulgarian standard language. It has also to be noted that some attempts from Bulgarian officials for joint actions and celebration of the Ilinden uprising were rejected from Macedonian side as unacceptable.

Nevertheless, on August 2, 2017, the Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his Macedonian colleague Zoran Zaev placed wreaths at the grave of Gotse Delchev on the occasion of the 114th anniversary of the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising, after the previous day, both have signed a treaty for friendship and cooperation between the neighboring states. The treaty also calls for a committee to &quot;objectively re-examine the common history&quot; of Bulgaria and Macedonia and envisages both countries will celebrate together events from their shared history. According to Bulgarian officials, this commission has made little progress in its work for a period of two years. Moreover in an interview on August 4, 2018 Zaev said that “the Ilinden uprising is Macedonian” and “if any citizen of Bulgaria wants to celebrate it, let them celebrate it.” As result in 2020, Bulgaria blocked the candidature of North Macedonia to the European Union over an &#x27;ongoing nation-building process&#x27; based on historical negationism of the Bulgarian legacy in the broader region of Macedonia.

<text>Francis William Thring IV (11 May 1926 – 29 December 1994) was an Australian character actor in radio, stage, television and film; as well as a theatre director. His early career started in London in theatre productions, before he starred in Hollywood film, where he became best known for roles in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; in 1959 and &quot;King of Kings&quot; in 1961. He was known for always wearing black and styling his home in black decor.

==Early life==

Thring was born in Melbourne. Although sometimes referred to as Frank Thring Jr. because of his well-known father, F. W. Thring, he was actually Francis William Thring (or William Francis Thring) IV. His forebears were Francis William Thring (1812–1887), Francis William Thring (known as William Thring) (1858–1920); William Frank Thring, known as Francis William Thring or F. W. Thring, (1882–1936).

Thring was the son of F. W. Thring and Olive (née Kreitmeyer), and was educated at the Melbourne Grammar School. His father was the head of the theatrical firm J. C. Williamson&#x27;s in the 1920s, and subsequently founded the theatre film production studio Efftee Studios in the 1930s, in Melbourne, Australia. He has been anachronistically claimed to have been the inventor of the clapperboard. Thring Sr. was also a noted film producer (&quot;The Sentimental Bloke&quot;), and partner in the nationwide Australian theatre circuit Hoyts. Thring Sr. died in July 1936 at the age of 53, when Frank Jr. was 10 years old. His second wife (Frank Jr.&#x27;s mother) inherited all the businesses. Frank said his earliest memory is of his mother standing on a stepladder in the foyer of the Regent Theatre in Melbourne, and arranging gladioli in the vases attached to the pillars.

==Career==
His career spanned more than 45 years, much of it spent alternating between stage, film and television. Perhaps his most famous roles were that of Pontius Pilate in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959) and Herod Antipas in &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961).

===Radio===
Thring&#x27;s family operated Melbourne radio station 3XY, from the opening of the station in 1935. He commenced working at 3XY as both a thespian and radio announcer in 1941, as a young man of 15. His numerous jobs at the microphone included being &quot;Uncle Frankie&quot; in the children&#x27;s session. When Thring Sr died in 1936 (see above), Thring Jr.&#x27;s mother inherited the businesses. However, Thring Jr. incorrectly told people that he owned 3XY.

===Stage===
He began acting in professional stage roles after his discharge from the Royal Australian Air Force in 1945. He was memorable as Herod in Irene Mitchell&#x27;s production of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; at Melbourne&#x27;s Arrow Theatre in 1951, and made his British theatrical debut in the same part in 1954. Two years later, he played Sir Lancelot Spratt in &quot;Doctor in the House&quot;, which ran for 240 performances at the Victoria Palace in London.

He was Saturninus in the Royal Shakespeare Theatre production of &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; with Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh and Anthony Quayle. He also played Captain Hook opposite Peggy Cummins&#x27; Peter Pan. Among his other acclaimed stage roles were George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;, Captain Ahab in Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, Falstaff in &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, and Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Life of Galileo&quot;. Another stage role was in the musical &quot;Robert and Elizabeth&quot; opposite June Bronhill and Denis Quilley.

Later in life he returned to the stage playing both butlers in the Melbourne Theatre Company&#x27;s production of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; in 1988. His final stage appearance was in &quot;Humorists Read the Humorists&quot; at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 1992.

===Film===
Thring first appeared on screen as a child in the 1932 Australian film &quot;The Sentimental Bloke&quot;, directed by his father F. W. Thring. One of Thring&#x27;s most well-known screen roles was as Pontius Pilate in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959). He also appeared as Al-Kadir, Emir of Valencia in &quot;El Cid&quot; (1961). Thring was also awarded the Erik Kuttner Award for Acting (1965). In addition to these roles, Thring played a barrister in &quot;The Case of Mrs. Loring&quot; (1958), the usurping king Aella (Ælla of Northumbria) in &quot;The Vikings&quot; (1958) and Herod Antipas in &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961). Thring is the only actor to portray on film both of the historical figures directly responsible for authorizing the crucifixion of Christ according to the Gospels. He played numerous glowering bad guys in Hollywood epics of the 1950s and 1960s.
Back in Australia, he starred opposite James Mason and a young Helen Mirren in Michael Powell&#x27;s film &quot;Age of Consent&quot; (1969), and appeared in two biographical films about famous bushrangers: &quot;Ned Kelly&quot; (1970) and &quot;Mad Dog Morgan&quot; (1976). He played suave gangsters in &quot;Alvin Rides Again&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Man from Hong Kong&quot; (1975). In his later years, his screen roles included the devilish Collector in &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot; (1985), and a comedic role as an Alfred Hitchcock-like film director in the horror movie spoof, &quot;Howling III&quot; (1987).

===Television===
Thring&#x27;s television credits include the Australian miniseries &quot;Against the Wind&quot; and &quot;Bodyline&quot;. He was also the recurring villain Doctor Stark who would use mischievous means in attempts to steal Skippy and other animals out of Waratah National Park in several episodes of &quot;Skippy the Bush Kangaroo&quot;.
He also acted in commercials, particularly one in which he would glare at the camera saying &quot;You do have your television licence. Don&#x27;t you?&quot;.

He had the lead roles in the 1959 ABC TV play &quot;Treason&quot;, and the 1962 ABC play &quot;Light Me A Lucifer&quot;.

==Personal life==
Off-screen, Thring was known for his flamboyant, often waspish, persona. He was featured in numerous TV commercials and guest-starring roles on popular weekly series, variety programs and quiz shows, often dressed in black funereal attire and other sinister costumes - the interior of his house was featured in an Australian TV program and the walls were also black. However, his acting career was interrupted by bouts of alcoholism and periods of ill health.

Thring was appointed 1982 &quot;King of Moomba&quot;, &quot;this doyenne [sic] of film and theatre looked nothing short of majestic in his regal garb and riding on a thespian-inspired float&quot;.

Thring was briefly married to actress Joan Cunliffe during the 1950s. The marriage ended in divorce. Cunliffe lived in London and was manager of both Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn. Thring was flamboyantly gay, but he wanted children and was greatly distressed when his marriage ended without issue.

On 29 December 1994, Thring died from oesophageal cancer, aged 68. He was cremated and his ashes scattered off the coast of Queenscliff, Victoria. A celebration of his life was held at the Victorian Arts Centre, Melbourne, in 1995.

<doc id="622537" wikidata="Q6044480" url="?curid=622537" title="Intentional infliction of emotional distress">
<text>Intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED; sometimes called the tort of outrage) is a common law tort that allows individuals to recover for severe emotional distress caused by another individual who intentionally or recklessly inflicted emotional distress by behaving in an &quot;extreme and outrageous&quot; way. Some courts and commentators have substituted &quot;mental&quot; for &quot;emotional&quot;, but the tort is the same.

==Rationale for classification==
IIED was created in tort law to address a problem that would arise when applying the common law form of assault. The common law tort of assault did not allow for liability when a threat of battery was not imminent. A common case would be a future threat of harm that would not constitute common law assault but would nevertheless cause emotional harm to the recipient. IIED was created to guard against this kind of emotional abuse, thereby allowing a victim of emotional distress to receive compensation in situations where he or she would otherwise be barred from compensation under the common law form.

According to the first doctrine articulated by common law courts, a plaintiff could not recover for physical injury from fright alone absent a physical impact from an external source (&quot;shock without impact&quot;), even if the fright was proven to have resulted from a defendant&#x27;s negligence, with the case on point referring to the negligent operation of a railroad in Australia, as decided by the imperial Privy Council. Even with intentional conduct, absent material damage, claims for emotional harm were similarly barred. &quot;Mental pain or anxiety, the law cannot value and does not pretend to redress, when the unlawful act causes that alone. Though where a material damage occurs, and is connected with it, it is impossible a jury, in estimating it, should altogether overlook the feelings of the party interested.&quot; Courts had been reluctant to accept a tort for emotional harm for fear of opening a &quot;wide door&quot; to frivolous claims.

A change first occurred in the Irish courts, which repudiated the Australian railroad decision and recognised liability for &quot;nervous shock&quot; in the &quot;Byrne&quot; (1884) and &quot;Bell&quot; (1890) cases. In England, the idea that physical/mental shock without impact from an external source should be a bar to recovery was first questioned at the Queen&#x27;s Bench in &quot;Pugh v. London, etc. Railroad Co.&quot; In the following year, the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench formally recognised the tort, for the first time, in the case of &quot;Wilkinson v Downton&quot;, although it was referred to as &quot;intentional infliction of mental shock&quot;. &quot;Wilkinson&quot; has been subsequently approved by both the Court of Appeal (&quot;Janvier v Sweeney&quot; [1919] 2 KB 316) and House of Lords (). Citing &quot;Pugh&quot; and the Irish courts as precedent, the &quot;Wilkinson&quot; court noted the willful nature of the act as a direct cause of the harm.

==Elements==
# Defendant acted intentionally or recklessly; and
# Defendant&#x27;s conduct was extreme and outrageous; and
# Defendant&#x27;s act is the cause of the distress; and
# Plaintiff suffers severe emotional distress as a result of defendant&#x27;s conduct.

===Intentional or reckless act===
It is not necessary that an act be &quot;intentionally&quot; offensive. A reckless disregard for the likelihood of causing emotional distress is sufficient.

===Extreme and outrageous conduct===
The conduct must be heinous and beyond the standards of civilized decency or utterly intolerable in a civilized society. Whether the conduct is illegal does not determine whether it meets this standard. IIED is also known as the tort of &quot;outrage&quot;, due to a classic formulation of the standard: the conduct must be such that it would cause a reasonable person to feel extremely offended, shocked, and/or outraged.

Some general factors that will persuade that the conduct was extreme and outrageous (1) there was a pattern of conduct, not just an isolated incident; (2) the plaintiff was vulnerable and the defendant knew it; (3) the defendant was in a position of power; (4) racial epithets were used; and (5) the defendant owed the plaintiff a fiduciary duty.

===Causation===
The actions of the defendant must have actually caused the plaintiff&#x27;s emotional distress beyond the bounds of decency. IIED can be done through speech or action; if emotional stress, must manifest physically.

===Qualification===
The emotional distress suffered by the plaintiffs must be &quot;severe&quot;. This standard is quantified by the intensity, duration, and any physical manifestations of the distress. A lack of productivity or a mental disorder, documented by a mental health professional, is typically required here, although acquaintances&#x27; testimony about a change in behavior could be persuasive. Extreme sadness, anxiety, or anger in conjunction with a personal injury (though not necessarily) may also qualify for compensation.

==Pleading practices==
In civil procedure systems (such as in the United States) that allow plaintiffs to plead multiple alternative theories that may overlap or even contradict each other, a plaintiff will usually bring an action for both intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED). This is just in case the plaintiff later discovers that it is impossible to prove at trial the necessary intent; even then, the jury may still be able to rule for them on the NIED claim.

There are some reported cases in which a plaintiff will bring &quot;only&quot; a NIED claim even though a reasonable neutral observer could conclude that the defendant&#x27;s behavior was probably intentional. This is usually because the defendant may have some kind of insurance coverage (like homeowners&#x27; insurance or automobile liability insurance). As a matter of public policy, insurers are barred from covering intentional torts like IIED, but may be liable for NIED committed by their policyholders, and therefore are targeted indirectly in this fashion as deep pockets.

==First Amendment considerations==
The U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Hustler v. Falwell&quot; involved an IIED claim brought by the evangelist Jerry Falwell against the publisher of Hustler Magazine for a parody ad that described Falwell as having lost his virginity to his mother in an outhouse. The Court ruled that the First Amendment protected such parodies of public figures from civil liability.

&quot;Oliotius oligolepis&quot; , a species of barb from Southeast Asia has at times been placed in the genus &quot;Barbus&quot; which would render the current species invalid as a junior homonym.

<text>The Chevrolet Lumina is a mid-size car that was produced and marketed by the Chevrolet division of General Motors from 1989 until 2001.

== Background ==
The first generation of the Lumina replaced the Chevrolet Celebrity and Chevrolet Monte Carlo under a single nameplate; the mechanically unrelated Chevrolet Lumina APV minivan served as the successor for the Celebrity station wagon. The model line was based on the front-wheel-drive GM10 platform (later designated the GM W platform), shared with Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac. For 1995, the second-generation Lumina was introduced, serving as a substantial exterior revision of the previous generation (the two-door coupe was renamed the Monte Carlo). For the 2000 model year, the Lumina was replaced by the Chevrolet Impala; the model line would retain the W platform through the 2016 model year.

Throughout its production, both generations of the Lumina were produced by General Motors Canada at Oshawa Car Assembly (Oshawa, Ontario). For markets outside of North America, the Chevrolet Lumina was derived from other large GM sedans. From 1998 to 2013, the Lumina was marketed in the Middle East and South Africa as a Chevrolet-badged version of the Holden Commodore produced in Australia. From 2005 to 2006, GM Philippines sold the Lumina as a Chevrolet-badged version of the Buick Regal (sharing much of its body with its American counterpart).
== First generation (1990) ==


The North American Chevrolet Lumina was based on the mid-size GM10 platform, which was shared with the Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, and Buick Regal. Although the Lumina became a popular seller, GM was widely criticized in the motoring press for being late to the game in introducing a direct aero-designed competitor to the Ford Taurus. The &quot;Lumina&quot; name was considered by Ford in the pre-production stage of the Taurus. Both body styles were available in base and sporty Euro trim, which was a successor to the Celebrity Eurosport.
Airbags were not yet available at the time of introduction so seat belts were installed in the front doors as &quot;passive restraints&quot;. These belts were connected to the upper and lower portions of the front doors, and could remain latched while allowing front passengers the ability to enter and exit the vehicle without removing them. This technically satisfied US Government regulations concerning passive occupant safety requirements. GM was heavily criticized for the lack of airbags in Lumina, by 1993 the Ford Taurus, Honda Accord and Toyota Camry all came equipped with at least one front airbag.

The coupe and sedan were installed with MacPherson front struts, while the rear suspension used Chapman struts and a transverse-mounted fiberglass leaf spring, borrowing an approach used from the Chevrolet Corvette (C4) rear suspension.

The Chevrolet Lumina&#x27;s first generation ended production in August 1994, making this the shortest-produced generation of the first-generation GM10 cars.

=== NASCAR ===
In 1989, the Lumina became the nameplate under which Chevrolets were raced in NASCAR, more than a year before the model was available to the public. As a result, NASCAR received many letters complaining about the unfair advantage of Chevrolet racing an &quot;aluminum&quot; car.

=== Lumina Z34 ===

Starting in 1990, Chevrolet offered a high-performance version of the Lumina, the Lumina Z34. It came standard with the FE3 sport suspension package, the LQ1 V6 engine shared with the Lumina Euro 3.4 (sedan), the 5-speed Getrag 284 manual transmission, dual exhaust, and 4-wheel anti-lock brakes. 

The Z34 also featured cosmetic changes to go along with the performance enhancements such as unique front and rear fascias, side skirts, a rear spoiler, a louvered hood, a unique steering wheel, and sport bucket seats, and an optional Bose stereo system. 

Performance figures included a 0-60 mph (0–97 km/h) time of 7.1 seconds, a 1/4 mile (~400 m) time of 15.5 seconds, a (limited) top speed of 113 mph, and a lateral acceleration of 0.79 g (7.7 m/s²). The optional Hydramatic 4T60-E automatic transmission lowered the horsepower rating to and 0-60 times by .5 seconds. The only paint colors available for the Z34 were white, red, black, gray, silver, and maui blue (added in 1993). In 1995, the Lumina Z34 was replaced with the Chevrolet Monte Carlo Z34.

=== Engines ===

* 1991–1994: &quot;LQ1&quot; V6

=== Production ===


== Second generation (1995) ==


General Motors began the development of an updated Lumina in 1989, under chief engineer Norm Sholler, planned for a late 1992 launch. By 1991, a final body design was approved. Development eventually took longer than planned, delaying the launch by 18 months. The redesigned Lumina was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 1994 as a 1995 model. The 1995 Lumina received a rounded body, increasing its size, as well as an updated interior. Unlike its other W platform counterparts, the Lumina retained the first-generation chassis. Replacing the Lumina two-door coupe was the resurrected Monte Carlo. The LH0 V6 was dropped in favor of the L82 V6, known as the 3100 SFI; the latter engine produced 20 more horsepower from the same displacement due to a revised intake manifold and cylinder heads.

Initial trim levels consisted of &quot;base&quot; and &quot;LS&quot;; the latter replacing the &quot;Euro&quot; trim. Options included an electric sunroof, leather bucket seats, power windows, a power driver seat, and an AM/FM stereo with a CD player. This Lumina was available with police (code 9C3) and taxi packages, because the Chevrolet Caprice was discontinued after the 1996 model year. Production began on Monte Carlo coupes in February 1994 and March 7, 1994 for Lumina sedans at GM&#x27;s Oshawa manufacturing plant, for a June 6, 1994 market launch for the 1995 model.

The LTZ trim was introduced in 1996 for the 1997 model year because the Impala SS and Caprice were discontinued. Standard features included 16&quot; brushed aluminum wheels, blackwall radial sport tires, sport tuned suspension, a 3.1 L V6 rated at and or an optional 3.4 L V6 rated at and of torque, a rear spoiler, restyled front and rear body clips (resembling the Monte Carlo Z34), a tachometer, and a floor-mounted shifter.

For 1998, the 3.4 L V6 was replaced by the 3800 Series II which produced and of torque. Despite its increased torque, the 3.8 L LTZ demonstrated slightly worse performance due to its lowered horsepower, with 0-60 mph (0–97 km/h) times of 7.5 seconds (as opposed to 7.2 seconds for the LQ1) and 1/4 mile (~400 m) times of 15.7 seconds (as opposed to 15.5 seconds for the LQ1). The car has a computer-limited top speed of and the rev limiter kicks in at 5,800 rpm for the 3.8 L (rev limiter is at 7,000 rpm for the 3.4 L LQ1).

Also in 1997, the 1998 model year Luminas received second generation airbags. The front-wheel-drive Chevrolet Impala was introduced as a replacement for the Lumina in 2000, although GM produced 2001 model year Luminas to be exclusively sold for rental fleets. Retail sales of the Lumina ended in Canada in 1999, with the United States following a year later. Fleet production ended on April 26, 2001. In some Asian countries, the Lumina continued as a rebadged Buick Century/Regal. 

=== Trim levels ===
Throughout its life cycle, the second generation Lumina was available in three trim levels:

Base (1995–2001): The most popular Lumina had a standard front row bench seat with seating for six passengers, power locks, tilt steering wheel, dual airbags, and air conditioning. Base models were equipped with fifteen-inch steel wheels with wheel covers.

LS (1995–1999): The mid-level trim models included aluminum wheels, optional dual-zone temperature controls, power windows (optional on Base), tachometer, higher-end stereo with GM&#x27;s Delcolock, anti-lock brakes, remote keyless entry system, upgraded seats, and an optional 3.4 L DOHC engine (1995-1996).

LTZ (1997–1999): The top-of-the-line Lumina included alloy wheels, a choice of the 3.1 L V6 engine, 3.4 L DOHC engine (1997), and the 3.8 L V6 engine (1998-1999), power driver seat, dual-zone climate control and leather with the option for deluxe cloth. A center console was standard on LTZ (optional on LS). Exterior differentiation included the front end, trunk lid, and taillights from the Fifth Generation Chevrolet Monte Carlo.

== Holden-based models ==


The Australian GM subsidiary, Holden, manufactured a third and fourth generation of the Chevrolet Lumina based on the rear-wheel-drive Commodore (VX, VY, VZ, and VE series).

=== Overview ===
Since the late 1990s, Holden Commodores were sold as the Chevrolet Lumina in the Middle East and South Africa in sedan, wagon and Ute coupé utility configurations. A coupe version based on the Holden Monaro was also sold in the Middle East as the Chevrolet Lumina Coupe.

In some Middle Eastern markets, the 3rd gen Commodore-based Lumina acted as the successor to the 2nd gen W-Body Lumina.

Export sales finished in 2013. The Lumina was indirectly replaced in some markets by the slightly smaller Chevrolet Malibu; and the Chevrolet Camaro for the 2-door coupe and &quot;SS&quot; variants.

=== Markets ===
In Arabia, the Lumina was offered in four different trims: LS (Omega), LTZ (Berlina), S (SV6) and SS (SS). The LTZ and S came standard with a 3.6 L Alloytec V6 and a six-speed automatic transmission for the S and four-speed for the LTZ, while the SS came standard with a 6.0 L l76 V8 with the option of active fuel management. A six-speed manual was standard with the option of a six-speed automatic on the SS. The LTZ was the luxury model, while the S and SS models focused on sportiness. Exports to the Middle East ceased in 2011.

Lumina models sold in South Africa dropped the V6 engine in favour of 6.0 litre V8 engine mated to a six-speed manual or automatic. Fuel injection and a 10.4:1 compression ratio help contribute to a max power output of at 5,700 rpm, and a max torque of at 4,400 rpm for vehicles equipped with the manual. Automatic cars make at 5,800 rpm and at 4,400 rpm. All cars were equipped with Brembo brake calipers and a ZF limited-slip differentials. The car received updates for the 2011 model year. These changes were introduced to coincide with the release of the VE Series II Commodore. Changes included revised bumpers, there is a chrome moulding above the number plate on the boot lid, refreshed alloy wheel designs and the Holden IQ system. Also the SSV model was introduced. The Holden Ute was sold as the &quot;Lumina Ute&quot; in South Africa and has the same equipment as the sedan. South African exports ceased in 2013.

Other Commodores sold under the bowtie brand were Holden Calais based Chevrolet Omega in Brazil; and High-performance models powered by Chevrolet V8 engines, including the high specification Chevrolet SS based on the VF Series, exported to the United States.


== Philippines model ==
The Chinese-built Buick Regal was sold in the Philippines from 2005 to 2006 as the Chevrolet Lumina. GM had withdrawn from the Philippines in 1985 along with Ford, finding the political and economic situation there untenable. This left only Nissan and Mitsubishi operating in the Filipino market. In 1997, GM returned with the Opel brand, and introduced the Opel Vectra, Opel Omega, and, shortly thereafter, the Tigra and Astra. In 2000, Chevrolet returned with the Chevrolet Suburban and Chevrolet Savana, with GM dealerships being rebranded as GM AutoWorld. However, Opel struggled in the Filipino market, with Japanese automakers accounting for 80% of the total market by the year 2000. After the discontinuation of the Omega, the Vectra became Opel&#x27;s largest sedan offering in the market. The Vectra struggled against rivals like the Nissan Cefiro, Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. GM withdrew the brand in 2003, leaving them without a car in the mid-size segment. In 2005, GM introduced the Chevrolet Lumina as a competitor to the growing mid-size sedan market.
The only engine offered was a 2.5 liter V6, producing 152 hp and 154 lb-ft of torque. Mated to the Lumina&#x27;s engine was a four-speed automatic. It had a top speed of 173 km/h and a 0-100km/h time of 12.8 seconds. The exhaust system was equipped with a Euro 2 standard catalytic converter. 

Safety features included a four-wheel disc brake system with ABS, an onboard vehicle diagnosis system, a tire pressure monitor, integrated turn signal/headlight housing, five seatbelts and dual front airbags. The Lumina&#x27;s body featured an integrated steel body structure with side impact protection. To prevent theft, the Lumina featured an engine immobilizer and a central locking system. 

Standard features included keyless entry, an eight-way power-adjustable driver&#x27;s seat, remote trunk opener, power side mirrors, and a tilt adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel with hydraulic power steering. The interior also featured leather seats, faux wood trim, a rear armrest, electronic climate control system, and a six speaker CD system. It was only available in three colors: white, silver, and black.

The Lumina is one out of two rebadged Chinese-market Buicks sold in the Philippines, the other being the Buick GL8-based Chevrolet Venture. Both are sourced from Shanghai GM. The car cost around P1.290M at the time and was quite a bit larger than the Vectra, measuring 20 inches longer and around 5 inches wider. This made it the largest car in its class, larger and wider than its main competitors, the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camry. The car was praised for being comfortable, spacious, and well-equipped, yet its design was criticized for being a &quot;bit too bland&quot;.

The Lumina was short-lived. It was discontinued in 2006, with production of the Chinese market Regal halting in 2008. Sales were poor, making the Lumina a rare car in the Philippines. In 2013, Chevrolet Philippines introduced the Chevrolet Malibu as the successor to the Lumina. It would eventually be discontinued in 2021.

<doc id="622542" wikidata="Q7316258" url="?curid=622542" title="Restoule">
<text>Restoule is a community and designated place in geographic Patterson Township in the Centre Unorganized Part of Parry Sound District in Central Ontario, Canada. It is situated on the Restoule River between Commanda Lake, and Restoule Lake and is part of the Almaguin Highlands region.

Restoule has a local services board that covers the main community of Restoule and the small communities of Carr and Farley&#x27;s Corners in neighbouring geographic Pringle Township. Along with the nearby communities of Loring and Port Loring and other smaller hamlets, the area promotes itself as the Loring-Restoule tourist area.

Restoule is located south of Lake Nipissing, and north of Ontario&#x27;s famous cottage country. Despite being north of this area, Restoule is a major centre for cottages, as is the entire Loring-Restoule region. Due to location and distance from Toronto, Restoule is not as popular as regions such as Muskoka to the south. The largest nearby city is North Bay 65 kilometres by road northeast of Restoule.

Restoule is located on Ontario Highway 534 and is a 9 kilometre drive southeast of Restoule Provincial Park. There is only one way to get into Restoule, and that&#x27;s on Highway 534 from the east. There&#x27;s a secondary route from the west from Dokis territory and leads into town on Hawthorne Rd. Entering the village, one can see the main General Store off the highway on the right. The main centre of the community however can be found off Highway 534, across the Restoule River. On this side of the river, there is a Royal Canadian Legion (Branch #639), a Lion&#x27;s Club, Community Centre, Outdoor Hockey Rink, Play structures, and a United Church. There is a Pentecostal Corner Gospel Church 5 km east of the village at the intersection of Hwys. 524 and 534. There are several housekeeping cottages, camps and lodges.

Cottages dot the shores of both Restoule Lake north of town and Commanda Lake south of town. Also dotting the rolling countryside are various farms. Most of all, the scenery is dominated by majestic forests on the Canadian Shield.

Restoule residents elect three local government organizations to manage their affairs: The Restoule Local Services Board, Patterson Township Local Roads Board and Restoule Sanitary Landfill Committee.

Restoule has broadband Internet access and cell phone service provided by Bell. As of August 2020, there is Fido/Rogers coverage (albeit &#x27;roaming&#x27;) in the area, including at nearby Restoule Provincial Park.

==Education==
The community had a public school from 1888 to 1992. The first iteration of the school was a one-room log schoolhouse. In 1912, it had expanded to a larger frame school house. A brick school house was built in 1956. When it shut its doors, the school had only 20 students and one teacher, and served grades 1 to 6. It was amalgamated with Nipissing Central and South Himsworth schools.

==Etymology==
This place in Parry Sound District, 36.1 km west of Powassan, was named in 1878 after Ojibwa chief Joseph Restoule, who was still alive when the postmaster provided details to the chief geographer of Canada in 1905.

==Other places of the same name in Ontario==
There is also a geographic Restoule Township in Algoma District, Ontario, on the Algoma Central Railway.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Restoule had a population of 502 living in 252 of its 559 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 455. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

According to the Canada 2016 Census:
* Population: 455
* % Change (2011-2016): +3.4
* Dwellings: 539
* Area (km²): 125.64
* Density (persons per km²): 3.6

==Notable residents==
* Frances Lankin, Canadian senator and former NDP Member of Provincial Parliament.
* Jess Larochelle, Canadian war hero who was severely wounded in the War in Afghanistan in 2006 and awarded the Star of Military Valour.

==Politics==

Politically, Restoule, as with most of rural Parry Sound District leans Conservative.

<doc id="622545" wikidata="Q190258" url="?curid=622545" title="Need">
<text>A need is a deficiency at a point of time and in a given context. Needs are distinguished from wants. In the case of a need, a deficiency causes a clear adverse outcome: a dysfunction or death. In other words, a need is something required for a safe, stable and healthy life (e.g. air, water, food, land, shelter) while a want is a desire, wish or aspiration. When needs or wants are backed by purchasing power, they have the potential to become economic demands. 

Basic needs such as air, water, food and protection from environmental dangers are necessary for an organism to live. In addition to basic needs, humans also have needs of a social or societal nature such as the human need for purpose, to socialize, to belong to a family or community or other group. Needs can be objective and physical, such as the need for food, or psychical and subjective, such as the need for self-esteem. Understanding both kinds of &quot;unmet needs&quot; is improved by considering the social context of their not being fulfilled.

Needs and wants are a matter of interest in, and form a common substrate for, the fields of philosophy, biology, psychology, social science, economics, marketing and politics.

== Psychological definition ==
To most psychologists, need is a psychological feature that arouses an organism to action toward a goal, giving purpose and direction to behavior.

The most widely known academic model of needs was proposed by psychologist Abraham Maslow in his hierarchy of needs in 1943. His theory proposed that people have a hierarchy of psychological needs, which range from basic physiological or lower order needs such as food, water and safety (e.g. shelter) through to the higher order needs such as self-actualization. People tend to spend most of their resources (time, energy and finances) attempting to satisfy these basic before the higher order needs of belonging, esteem and self-actualization become meaningful. Maslow&#x27;s approach is a generalised model for understanding human motivations in a wide variety of contexts but must be adapted for specific contexts. While intuitively appealing, Maslow&#x27;s model has been difficult to operationalize experimentally. It was developed further by Clayton Alderfer.

The academic study of needs, which was at its zenith in the 1950s, receives less attention among psychologists today. One exception involves Richard Sennett&#x27;s work on the importance of respect.

One difficulty with a psychological theory of needs is that conceptions of &quot;need&quot; may vary radically among different cultures or among different parts of the same society. For a psychological theory of human need, one found compatible with the Doyal/Gough Theory, see self-determination theory.

== Doyal and Gough&#x27;s definition == 
A second view of need is presented in the work of political economy professor Ian Gough, who has published on the subject of human needs in the context of social assistance provided by the welfare state. Together with medical ethics professor Len Doyal, he published &quot;A Theory of Human Need&quot; in 1991. 

Their view goes beyond the emphasis on psychology: it might be said that an individual&#x27;s needs represent &quot;the costs of being human&quot; within society. A person who does not have their needs fulfilled—i.e., a &quot;needy&quot; person—will function poorly in society.

In the view of Gough and Doyal, every person has an objective interest in avoiding serious harm that prevents that person from endeavoring to attain their vision of what is good, regardless of what exactly that may be. That endeavour requires a capacity to &quot;participate&quot; in the societal setting in which the individual lives. More specifically, every person needs to possess both physical health and personal autonomy. The latter involves the capacity to make informed choices about what should be done and how to implement it. This requires mental health, cognitive skills, and opportunities to participate in society&#x27;s activities and collective decision-making.

How are such needs satisfied? Doyal and Gough point to twelve broad categories of &quot;intermediate needs&quot; that define how the needs for physical health and personal autonomy are fulfilled:
# Adequate nutritious food and water
# Adequate protective housing
# A safe work environment 
# A supply of clothing 
# A safe physical environment
# Appropriate health care
# Security in childhood
# Meaningful primary relations with others
# Physical security
# Economic security
# Safe birth control and child-bearing
# Appropriate basic and cross-cultural education

How are the details of needs satisfaction determined? The authors point to rational identification of needs, using up-to-date scientific knowledge; consideration of the actual experiences of individuals in their everyday lives; and democratic decision-making. The satisfaction of human needs cannot be imposed &quot;from above&quot;.

This theory may be compared to the &quot;capability approach&quot; developed by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. Individuals with more internal &quot;assets&quot; or &quot;capacities&quot; (e.g., education, mental health, physical strength, etc.) have more capabilities (i.e., more available choices, more positive freedom). They are thus more able to escape or avoid poverty. Those individuals who possess more capabilities fulfill more of their needs.

Pending publication in 2015 in the Cambridge Journal of Economics of the final version of this work, Gough discussed the Doyal/Gough theory in a working paper available online.

The concept of intellectual need has been studied in education, as well as in social work, where an Oxford Bibliographies Online: Social Work entry on Human Need reviewed the literature as of 2008 on human need from a variety of disciplines. Also see the 2008 and pending 2015 entries on Human Needs: Overview in the Encyclopedia of Social Work.

In his 1844 &quot;Paris Manuscripts&quot;, Karl Marx famously defined humans as &quot;creatures of need&quot; or &quot;needy creatures&quot; who experienced suffering in the process of learning and working to meet their needs. These needs were both physical needs as well as moral, emotional and intellectual needs. According to Marx, human development is characterized by the fact that in the process of meeting their needs, humans develop new needs, implying that at least to some extent they make and remake their own nature. This idea is discussed in more detail by the Hungarian philosopher Ágnes Heller in &quot;A Theory of Need in Marx&quot; (London: Allison and Busby, 1976). Political economy professor Michael Lebowitz has developed the Marxian interpretation of needs further in two editions of his book &quot;Beyond Capital&quot;.

Professor György Márkus systematised Marx&#x27;s ideas about needs as follows: humans are different from other animals because their vital activity, work, is mediated to the satisfaction of needs (an animal who manufactures tools to produce other tools or his/her satisfactory), which makes a human being a universal natural being capable to turn the whole nature into the subject of his/her needs and his/her activity, and develops his/her needs and abilities (essential human forces) and develops himself/herself, a historical-universal being. Work generates the breach of the animal subject-object fusion, thus generating the possibility of human conscience and self-conscience, which tend to universality (the universal conscious being). A human being&#x27;s conditions as a social being are given by work, but not only by work as it is not possible to live like a human being without a relationship with others: work is social because human beings work for each other with means and abilities produced by prior generations. Human beings are also free entities able to accomplish, during their lifetime, the objective possibilities generated by social evolution, on the basis of their conscious decisions. Freedom should be understood both in a negative (freedom to decide and to establish relationships) and a positive sense (dominion over natural forces and development of human creativity) of the essential human forces. To sum up, the essential interrelated traits of human beings are: a) work is their vital activity; b) human beings are conscious beings; c) human beings are social beings; d) human beings tend to universality, which manifests in the three previous traits and make human beings natural-historical-universal, social-universal and universal conscious entities, and e) human beings are free.

In his texts about what he calls &quot;moral economics&quot;, professor Julio Boltvinik Kalinka asserts that the ideas exposed by David Wiggins about needs are correct but insufficient: needs are of a normative nature but they are also factual. These &quot;gross ethical concepts&quot; (as stated by Hilary Putnam) should also include an evaluation: Ross Fitzgerald&#x27;s criticism of Maslow&#x27;s ideas rejects the concept of objective human needs and uses instead the concept of preferences.

Marshall Rosenberg&#x27;s model of Compassionate Communication, also known as Nonviolent Communication (NVC) makes the distinction between universal human needs (what sustains and motivates human life) and specific strategies used to meet these needs. Feelings are seen as neither good nor bad, right nor wrong, but as indicators of when human needs are met or unmet. In contrast to Maslow, Rosenberg&#x27;s model does not place needs in a hierarchy.

Rosenberg&#x27;s model supports people developing awareness of feelings as indicators, of what needs are alive within them and others, moment by moment; to forefront needs, to make it more likely and possible for two or more people, to arrive at mutually agreed upon strategies to meet the needs of all parties. Rosenberg diagrams this sequence in part like this: Observations &gt; Feelings &gt; Needs &gt; Requests where identifying needs is most significant to the process.

People also talk about the needs of a community or organisation. Such needs might include demand for a particular type of business, for a certain government program or entity, or for individuals with particular skills. This is an example of metonymy in language and presents with the logical problem of reification.

Medical needs. 
In clinical medical practice, it may be difficult to distinguish between treatment a patient needs; treatment that may be desirable;and treatment that could be deemed frivolous. At one end of this spectrum for example, any practising clinician would accept that a child with fulminating meningococcal meningitis needs rapid access to medical care. At the other end, rarely could a young healthy woman be deemed to need breast augmentation. Numerous surgical procedures fall into this spectrum: particularly, this is so in our ageing Western population, where there is an ever-increasing prevalence of painful, but not life-threatening disorders: typified by the ageing spine.

<text>Hristo Naumov Shopov (, ; born 4 January 1964) is a Bulgarian actor. Shopov&#x27;s father, Naum Shopov, was a famous Bulgarian actor as well.

He is most noted for his 2004 portrayal of Pontius Pilate in Mel Gibson&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;. Shopov revived his role as Pilate in the 2006 film &quot;The Inquiry&quot;. His dual roles as Pilate make him, along with Frank Thring, one of two actors to twice portray a character directly responsible for authorizing the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. He has become one of Bulgaria&#x27;s most successful actors, making his debut in 1981 with &quot;Dishay, choveche&quot; (Breathe, Man!). His body of work includes many Bulgarian films such as &quot;Vchera&quot; (Yesterday) and &quot;Sledvay me&quot; (Follow Me). He has also appeared in several low-budget US film productions including &quot;Phantom Force&quot;, &quot;Target of Opportunity&quot; and &quot;Alien Hunter&quot;. In his homeland, he is best known for his role in the movie &quot;Vchera&quot;, which became a symbol of several generations. The movie tells the story of young Bulgarians studying in an elite English language school during Communist rule.

Mary Soan, an assistant director of the film &quot;I Am David&quot;, suggested that he would be suited for the role of Pilate to Shaila Rubin, who was casting the film. After Hristo and Gibson had a brief conversation, Hristo was given the part. Shopov also played the role of Pontius Pilate in the 2006 film &quot;The Inquiry&quot;, which also cast Max von Sydow as Emperor Tiberius.

<text>Adam Barrington Spencer (born 29 January 1969) is an Australian comedian, media personality and former radio presenter. He first came to fame when he won his round of the comedic talent search &quot;Raw Comedy&quot; in 1996. Soon thereafter, he began working at Triple J, on mid-dawn and drive shifts before hosting the Triple J &quot;Breakfast Show&quot; with Wil Anderson. He later hosted &quot;Breakfast&quot; on 702 ABC Sydney.

He is a patron of science-related events and programs, including the University of Sydney&#x27;s Sleek Geeks Science Prize (category in the Eureka Prize). He collaborated with Karl Kruszelnicki for the long-running Sleek Geek Week tour (as part of National Science Week). He hosts events and panels, writes mathematical recreation books, and performs his own comedy at events around the country.

He is a supporter of the Australian rules football team, the Sydney Swans, and was declared their number one ticket holder for the 2016 season.

==Early life==
Born on 29 January 1969, in Sydney, Spencer grew up in the Hunters Hill/Gladesville area.

A few hours after birth, he had a seizure, and doctors found blood between his brain and scalp. Twice in the first two days of his life, a priest was called to give the last rites. Between the ages of three until about 11, Spencer underwent a series of operations by eye surgeon Fred Hollows. The deadening of the eyelid muscle led to permanent ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid) and noticeable facial asymmetry. He later received a transplant from a donor (who had been in a motorcycle accident) in an operation, allowing him to &quot;open&quot; that eye.

His father Larry, died from prostate cancer in 2004. He has a brother and a sister.

Spencer attended Boronia Park Public School, where his favourite teacher, Ms Russell, encouraged his love of mathematics when he was in second grade, in 1976. In 1981 he won a scholarship to attend St Aloysius&#x27; College in Sydney, and was a vice-captain of the College and Captain of the Australian Schools Debating Team. He graduated with a score of 200 out of 200 in four-unit maths.

His earliest job was selling newspapers, and during university worked as a dishwasher at a pancake restaurant. He was a member of Scouts Australia.

Spencer was the first in his family to attend university, and originally enrolled to study arts-law. This included economics and philosophy, but he dropped out of those, taking up maths to &quot;round it out&quot;, but eventually changed to a maths major. He graduated from the University of Sydney with a Bachelor of Science with first class honours in pure mathematics in 1991, residing at St Paul&#x27;s College during his time there. While at university, he was one of the world&#x27;s top-ranked debaters, reaching the final round of the World Universities Debating Championship three times (1990, 1992, 1996) and winning &quot;World&#x27;s Best Individual Speaker&quot; (1996). He won the Australasian debating championship twice (1988, 1990). He was President of the University of Sydney Union.

==Career==
He was secretly entered into the Triple J Raw Comedy Championship in 1996 by a former girlfriend, and won the NSW championship (although this has also been reported as winning the second prize, as he came second in the national competition).

===Television===
Spencer has been a host of ABC science shows &quot;Quantum&quot;, &quot;FAQ&quot; and &quot;Sleek Geeks&quot;. He was a regular guest on the O&#x27;Loghlin variety comedy show since its first episode in June 1999.

In October 2001, he hosted the &quot;Visions for a Nation&quot; Federation Forum. This focused on the views of leading Australians about the challenges facing Australia in the 21st century. It later screened on the ABC.

In August 2002, he made a guest appearance on &quot;Cheez TV&quot; (Channel Ten), playing a burglar with an aversion to old Wham! songs. 
===Radio===
Spencer was spotted by radio station Triple J&#x27;s senior broadcaster, Helen Razer, at the 1996 Raw Comedy Finals, when he provided a live impromptu weather segment involving mathematical equations. This approach to presenting maths via the weather has been noted by other mathematicians.

He was invited to do occasional work at Triple J, and then hosted segments during the midnight-to-dawn shifts. He did guest spots entitled &quot;Bloking up&quot; on Razer and Judith Lucy&#x27;s &quot;Ladies Lounge&quot; afternoon show. When Lucy left Triple J for Melbourne&#x27;s FOX-FM, he joined as co-host of the &quot;Departure Lounge&quot;. Helen Razer left in 1998. In 1999, Spencer was later promoted to solo hosting of the breakfast show for approximately 18 months.

Wil Anderson joined Triple J in April 1999, beginning their co-hosting of the breakfast show. The highest-number of mathematical references made by Spencer on an episode the show was 32 instances on 7 March 2001. In 2002, Anderson and Spencer created a fictional metal band, Salmon Hater, with a single &quot;6.66 - One Hundredth of the Number of the Beast&quot;. It was rated as number 26 in Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100.

Both Anderson and Spencer chose to retire from the breakfast show in 2004. They hosted a comedic tribute show, &quot;The Last Time&quot;, which toured around Australia and focused on their six years in co-hosting the show. The tribute show&#x27;s title was a mocking take on John Farnham&#x27;s farewell tour, which was not actually his last tour.

On 20 February 2006, he began presenting &quot;Breakfast&quot; on 702 ABC Sydney, replacing Angela Catterns. His hosting was described as having transformed ABC 702 into a &quot;...science and maths, women&#x27;s sports and soft rock loving place to be...&quot; On 6 December 2013, Spencer hosted his last breakfast radio program for ABC 702, concluding 14 years of radio broadcasting at the age of 44. His farewell live show included Alex Lloyd performing a rewritten version of his song Amazing. For his final radio survey, Spencer was ranked second in the breakfast slot. He was replaced on ABC 702 by fellow Triple J alumni, Robbie Buck.

Spencer hosted the &quot;Smile High Club&quot; radio show programme on Qantas Airlines radio channel, Q, circa 2010.

===Presentations and hosting===

Spencer has hosted science-related events and held guest spots at a wide range of festivals and conferences, and has been described as &quot;the Eddie McGuire of edgy cultural events.&quot;

Spencer was interviewed about issues affecting teens, for George Negus&#x27; New Dimensions&#x27; special screenings during Youth Week in 2003.

He went through Channel 7&#x27;s Wheel of Fortune&#x27;s formal audition process in April 2004. He then played on the show in June 2004. He became a carry-over champion and won a telescope.

For several years, Spencer has hosted both the Eureka awards and the Prime Minister&#x27;s Prizes for Science award ceremonies. The Eureka awards have included a sponsored namesake award: the online &quot;Adam Spencer/University of Sydney Eureka Schools Prize for Lateral Thinking&quot;. The namesake award was issued in 2003 and 2004.

Spencer has presented televised coverage of Tropfest for a number of years, including 2006 and 2013.

He interviewed Breaking Bad scriptwriter Vince Gilligan during the Sydney Writers&#x27; Festival in 2014.
===Controversies and criticism===
===Publications===
====Books====
Spencer has written several mathematical recreation books.
====Articles====
In August 2002, Spencer provided commentary in an ABC online article about the interpretation of the AKS algorithm.

====Compilation CD trilogy====
The ABC published a trilogy of compilation CDs of &quot;Adam Spencer&#x27;s breakfast music&quot;. The CD series was issued under the Mytunes series name (distinct from the MyTunes program used to circumvent iTunes restrictions). They included &quot;Mytunes&quot; (2011), &quot;Mytunes 2&quot; (2012) and &quot;Mytunes 3&quot; (2013).

====Interviews====
=====Guest book chapters=====
Spencer was interviewed about how to have a safe and happy sex life, for Julie McCrossin&#x27;s book, &quot;Love, Lust and Latex&quot; (2000).

He was interviewed for a chapter on prelabour in Lucy Perry&#x27;s book, &quot;Cheers to childbirth: a dad&#x27;s guide to childbirth support&quot; (2010)

=====Television episode=====
Spencer and producer Jo Chichester were interviewed for episode nine of ABC&#x27;s television series &quot;Artzone&quot; in 1999.

==Personal life==
Spencer was prompted to lose 25 kilograms in 2000, at the behest of his then-girlfriend.

He met his now ex-wife Melanie Mossman at a pub trivia night, telling her an answer in the quiz (&quot;The actor is George Clooney and the film is Solaris.&quot;).

On the final day of his breakfast show in November 2004, he announced that his partner Melanie Mossman was pregnant and that the next year he would be leaving his media career to become a full-time dad. He returned within two years to present another breakfast radio show. He married Mel on 28 January 2006 in the Great Hall at Sydney University, where guests were asked to donate to charities in lieu of gifts. They have two daughters. When his oldest daughter was six months old, Spencer donated money for a fly to be named after her, Fijian fly &quot;A. Amblypsilopus elaquarae&quot; (&quot;Elaquare&#x27;s Amblypsilopus&quot;). This was through the Australian Museum&#x27;s project to seek funding by giving new animal species namesakes for a donation.

In 2014, thieves broke into Spencer&#x27;s family home in Newtown, taking valuables including a laptop containing photos of his daughter. His car was also stolen, and was later found crashed into a power pole in Victoria Street, Marrickville. In 2015 Spencer, Mossman and their children moved to Copacabana, and listed the Newtown property for auction in August 2016.

In August 2017, Spencer confirmed he and Mossman had separated in early 2015 and been divorced for some time.

While Spencer attended St. Aloysius&#x27; College and was brought up a Catholic, he describes himself an atheist.

===Cycling===
Spencer has participated in cycling events in Sydney for charity. In March 2001, he led the cyclist portion of Oxfam Community Aid Abroad&#x27;s Walk Against Want Victoria Park Fundraiser.

<doc id="622553" wikidata="Q1071103" url="?curid=622553" title="Chevrolet Celebrity">
<text>The Chevrolet Celebrity is a front-drive, mid-size passenger car line, manufactured and marketed by Chevrolet for model years 1982–1990, over a single generation. 

Marking the transition of the mid-size Chevrolet range to front-wheel drive, the Celebrity succeeded the rear-drive Chevrolet Malibu line. Initially marketed between the Citation and the Impala within the Chevrolet model line, the Celebrity was later marketed between the Corsica and Caprice sedans. 

The Celebrity shared the front-wheel drive GM A platform with the Buick Century, Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, and Pontiac 6000 in two-door notchback coupe, four-door sedan, and five-door station wagon body styles.

After the 1989 model year, the Celebrity sedan was replaced by the Chevrolet Lumina; the Celebrity station wagon was discontinued after 1990, with the Chevrolet Lumina APV minivan serving as its replacement.

The Celebrity and its A-body counterparts became widely known as one of the most transparent examples of corporate product rebadging in the American automotive industry. The four model lines were highlighted on the August 22, 1983 cover of &quot;Fortune&quot; as examples of genericized uniformity. Hemmings Motor News would later cover the effect of the &quot;Fortune&quot; article, relating &quot;how a single magazine cover photo changed the course of auto design at GM in the Eighties.&quot; Embarrassed by the incident, GM subsequently recommitted to development of divisional brand identity. 

==Model overview==
General Motors first used the Celebrity nameplate in the early 1960s, denoting a pillared sedan version of the Oldsmobile 88. 

Introduced in January 1982, the Chevrolet Celebrity was offered in two-door and four-door notchback sedan body styles. Chevrolet was the first GM division to transition its mid-size sedans to front-wheel drive, producing the Celebrity alongside its Malibu predecessor for both 1982 and 1983. 

=== Chassis ===
The Celebrity is based on the GM A-body platform, introduced for 1982. The successor to the rear-wheel drive A-body intermediate chassis (renamed as the G-body), the A platform was the first mass-market American mid-size architecture to adopt front-wheel drive. To maximize development and production efficiency, the chassis was a derivative of the compact GM X platform, with the Celebrity sharing its 104.9 wheelbase with the Chevrolet Citation. 

While not as extensive of a downsizing as the 1977 Impala/Caprice, the 1978 Malibu, or the 1980 Citation, the 1982 Celebrity lost approximately 4 inches in length and 2 inches of width over the Malibu. 

Though derived from the X-body chassis, the A-body platform would not share entirely in its controversial recall issues. There were drivability problems with the computerized engine control system in 1982 models, and deterioration of the upper engine mount (also called a dogbone) caused engine/transaxle vibration. 

==== Powertrain ====
For its 1982 launch, the Celebrity was offered with three engines. A 2.5 L inline-4 was standard, with an optional 2.8 L V6; an 4.3 L diesel V6 (effectively, of the Oldsmobile diesel V8) was also offered as an option. All three engines were paired with a three-speed automatic transmission.

For 1984, the standard 2.5 L engine was retuned to , with the 2.8 L H.O. V6 (from the Citation X-11) becoming an option. A four-speed manual was offered with both the 2.5 L I4 and the H.O. V6; a four-speed automatic (with overdrive) was optional with either 2.8 L engine.

For 1985, the 2.8 L H.O. V6 switched from a 2-barrel carburetor to multiport fuel injection. In a revision, the H.O. V6 was no longer offered with a manual transmission, but the 4-speed automatic remained for both V6 engines.

For 1986, the 4.3 L diesel V6 was dropped, with the H.O. V6 retuned to . The three-speed automatic remained, paired only with the 2.5 L engine.

For 1987, the powertrain line underwent several revisions. The carbureted 2.8 L engine was dropped, leaving the 2.5 L I4, retuned to , and fuel-injected 2.8 L V6, retuned to . Both engines were fitted with a three-speed automatic as standard equipment; the 2.8 L V6 was offered with an optional four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission.

For 1988, the 2.5 L engine was fitted with balance shafts, with the 2.8 L V6 retuned to .

For 1989, the five-speed manual transmission was dropped. As a running change, the 2.5 L engine was retuned to .

For 1990 (station wagons only), the 2.8 L engine was replaced by a 3.1 L V6.


=== Body ===
The Celebrity shares its roofline with the 1982–1988 Pontiac 6000, Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera and Buick Century and is distinguished from other A-platform vehicles by its coved rear fascia. For 1984, Chevrolet introduced a five-door Celebrity station wagon with a liftgate and hatchback rear window. For the first time since 1977, a mid-size Chevrolet station wagon was available with a third-row seat.

Throughout its production, Chevrolet introduced few updates to the model line, with minor exterior updates in 1984, 1986, and 1987. For 1987, the hoodline was lowered slightly, distinguished by the introduction of composite headlamp lenses and a smaller grille design. In 1986, the rear fascia was revised, adding wraparound taillamp lenses and a center-mount brake lamp (CHMSL). To comply with passive-restraint regulations, the model line received door-mounted seatbelts for 1990 (in place of airbags).

=== Trim ===
During its nine-year run, the Celebrity was available with various trim/option packages including CS, CL, Estate (which added exterior simulated woodgrain applique on wagons), Eurosport, and Eurosport VR.

==== Celebrity Eurosport ====
One of the most notable versions of the Chevrolet Celebrity is the Celebrity Eurosport. Introduced in 1984 as an option package, the Eurosport is both a cosmetic and performance option package for the Chevrolet Celebrity. Distinguished by its black window trim and red emblems, the Eurosport was offered with the 2.8 L H.O. V6 from the Citation X-11 as an option (along with any Celebrity powertrain). Other parts of the Eurosport package include a heavy-duty F41 suspension, black steering wheel and 14&quot; Sport Rallye wheels (which became an option for all Celebrity sedans/wagons). The interior was given model-specific red emblems on the door panels and dashboard.

For the 1988 model year, the Olympic Eurosport edition was offered in Canada as a tie-in to the Calgary Winter Olympics. Offered only in monochrome white, with all blackout trim exterior painted white to match the body. The only interior colour trim was saddle, with an Olympic logo mounted on the B pillar.

==== Celebrity Eurosport VR ====
Based on the 1986 Chevrolet Eurosport RS concept car, Chevrolet offered the Celebrity Eurosport VR limited edition option package for 1987 and 1988. Converted by Autostyle Cars, near Oklahoma City Assembly, the Eurosport VR was fitted with ground effects, body decals, a blacked-out grille, and aluminum wheels. The Eurosport VR was produced in only four colors: red, silver, black, and white.

For 1987, the VR was offered for the four-door sedan and station wagon and are distinguished by their interior, which includes red carpeting, special tri-color door panels, bucket seats with thigh bolsters, and a rear seat cup holder. For 1988, two-door versions were produced as well and were produced with interiors from a standard Celebrity or Celebrity CL.

=== Discontinuation ===

Following the 1987 model year, General Motors ended regular updates to the Celebrity, concentrating on development of the Chevrolet Lumina. Coinciding with declining sales of sedan-based coupes, the two-door Celebrity was dropped after the 1988 model year. Outliving the two-door Caprice by a year, the two-door Celebrity gave way to the Chevrolet Beretta and the two-door Chevrolet Lumina (the latter intended as the successor to the Monte Carlo).

After 1989, Chevrolet discontinued the Celebrity sedan (marketing it alongside the 1990 Lumina), offering only the station wagon for 1990. As consumer demand for family vehicles shifted from station wagons to minivans, the Lumina APV served as the functional replacement for the Celebrity wagon. As of 2025, it was the last mid-sized Chevrolet station wagon.

The Pontiac 6000 was discontinued after 1991, with the Buick Century and Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera continuing in production nearly unchanged until the end of the 1996 model year.

== Production ==
During the 1980s, within Chevrolet, the Celebrity competed with the Cavalier as the highest-selling car of the brand. Along with becoming the highest-selling Chevrolet car for 1986 and 1987, the Celebrity would be the highest-selling car in the United States for 1986. As of current production, this remains the last time a Chevrolet vehicle (or any GM-brand vehicle) has done so.

<doc id="622555" wikidata="Q7945296" url="?curid=622555" title="W. A. Mathieu">
<text>William Allaudin Mathieu (born 1937) is a composer, pianist, choir director, music teacher, and author. He began studying piano at the age of six, and began recording his music and compositions in the 1970s on his record label, Cold Mountain Music. Mathieu has composed and recorded solo piano works, chamber pieces, choral music, and song cycles, and he has written four books on music, music theory, and how to live a musical life.

== Career ==
Mathieu studied jazz composition with William Russo from 1954 to 1958; Eurocentric music with Easley Blackwood from 1963 to 1967; Middle Eastern music with Nubian master musician Hamza El Din from 1971 to 2004, with whom he also collaborated; and raga with North Indian vocalist Pandit Pran Nath from 1973 to 1996. Mathieu&#x27;s recordings reflect the integration of these and many other influences.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s (as Bill Mathieu), he spent several years as an arranger and composer for Stan Kenton and Duke Ellington orchestras. Kenton&#x27;s album &quot;Standards in Silhouette&quot; consists entirely of Mathieu&#x27;s arrangements and revealed the young Mathieu (then 22 years of age) to be an adept manipulator of compositional materials.

He was one of the founders and the musical director for The Second City in Chicago, the first ongoing improvisational theater troupe in the United States, and was later the musical director for The Committee, an improv theater in San Francisco that was an offshoot of The Second City. In the 1970s, he was on the faculties of San Francisco Conservatory of Music and Mills College. In 1969, Mathieu founded the Sufi Choir in San Francisco among followers of Samuel L. Lewis, and he directed the choir until 1982.

Mathieu enjoys sharing his tuning expertise with others, including beginners — and especially those who are convinced they are tone-deaf. “Nobody is tone-deaf,” he claims. He has regularly trained his “Tone-Deaf Choirs” to sing in tune, often in public.

He now devotes himself to practice, performance, recording, composition, teaching, and writing from his home near Sebastopol, California.

==Early life==
Mathieu was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. His father was Aron M. Mathieu (1907–1996), publisher and founder of &quot;Minicam&quot; (later retitled Modern Photography) in 1937, editor at Writer&#x27;s Digest for three decades, and founder of the Writer&#x27;s Market franchise. His mother was Rosella Feher Mathieu (1906–2008), noted authority on herbs, and author of &quot;Herb Grower&#x27;s Complete Guide&quot; (1950), one of the first books in the United States on growing and cooking with herbs.

In Cincinnati, Mathieu attended Kennedy-Silverton Elementary School (1942–1949) and Walnut Hills High School (1949–1954). In Chicago, he attended University of Chicago (1954–1958), earning a BA degree.

: &quot;Harmonic Experience&quot; (561 pages) offers a view of music theory that harmonizes Western and Eastern perspectives. Understanding can be actively enhanced by utilizing its autodidactic ear-training and sight-singing exercises, especially using singing sargam syllables over a drone such as a tamboura or possibly a Western fifth played in just intonation. Mathieu is described as Neo-Riemannian and he cites Ernst Levy, who wrote of harmonic polarity and undertones, as an influence. The book has been praised by folk musician Pete Seeger.

<text>A nibbler, or nibblers, is a tool for cutting sheet metal with minimal distortion. They may be used for nibbling. One type operates much like a punch and die, with a blade that moves in a linear fashion against a fixed die, removing small bits of metal and leaving a kerf approximately wide. Another type operates similar to tin snips, but shears the sheet along two parallel tracks apart, rolling up the waste in a tight spiral as it cuts. Nibblers may be manual (hand operated) or powered.

Power nibblers are often powered by compressed air, though electrical types also exist. A common DIY nibbler tool is an electric drill attachment, which converts the rotary motion of the drill into a reciprocating motion of the jaw.

<text>A ubiquitin ligase (also called an E3 ubiquitin ligase) is a protein that recruits an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that has been loaded with ubiquitin, recognizes a protein substrate, and assists or directly catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the protein substrate. In simple and more general terms, the ligase enables movement of ubiquitin from a ubiquitin carrier to another protein (the substrate) by some mechanism. The ubiquitin, once it reaches its destination, ends up being attached by an isopeptide bond to a lysine residue, which is part of the target protein. E3 ligases interact with both the target protein and the E2 enzyme, and so impart substrate specificity to the E2. Commonly, E3s polyubiquitinate their substrate with Lys48-linked chains of ubiquitin, targeting the substrate for destruction by the proteasome. However, many other types of linkages are possible and alter a protein&#x27;s activity, interactions, or localization. Ubiquitination by E3 ligases regulates diverse areas such as cell trafficking, DNA repair, and signaling and is of profound importance in cell biology. E3 ligases are also key players in cell cycle control, mediating the degradation of cyclins, as well as cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor proteins. The human genome encodes over 600 putative E3 ligases, allowing for tremendous diversity in substrates.

==Ubiquitination system==

The ubiquitin ligase is referred to as an E3, and operates in conjunction with an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. There is one major E1 enzyme, shared by all ubiquitin ligases, that uses ATP to activate ubiquitin for conjugation and transfers it to an E2 enzyme. The E2 enzyme interacts with a specific E3 partner and transfers the ubiquitin to the target protein. The E3, which may be a multi-protein complex, is, in general, responsible for targeting ubiquitination to specific substrate proteins.

The ubiquitylation reaction proceeds in three or four steps depending on the mechanism of action of the E3 ubiquitin ligase. In the conserved first step, an E1 cysteine residue attacks the ATP-activated C-terminal glycine on ubiquitin, resulting in a thioester Ub-S-E1 complex. The energy from ATP and diphosphate hydrolysis drives the formation of this reactive thioester, and subsequent steps are thermoneutral. Next, a transthiolation reaction occurs, in which an E2 cysteine residue attacks and replaces the E1. HECT domain type E3 ligases will have one more transthiolation reaction to transfer the ubiquitin molecule onto the E3, whereas the much more common RING finger domain type ligases transfer ubiquitin directly from E2 to the substrate. The final step in the first ubiquitylation event is an attack from the target protein lysine amine group, which will remove the cysteine, and form a stable isopeptide bond. One notable exception to this is p21 protein, which appears to be ubiquitylated using its N-terminal amine, thus forming a peptide bond with ubiquitin.

==Ubiquitin ligase families==
Humans have an estimated 500-1000 E3 ligases, which impart substrate specificity onto the E1 and E2. The E3 ligases are classified into four families: HECT, RING-finger, U-box, and PHD-finger. The RING-finger E3 ligases are the largest family and contain ligases such as the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and the SCF complex (Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein complex). SCF complexes consist of four proteins: Rbx1, Cul1, Skp1, which are invariant among SCF complexes, and an F-box protein, which varies. Around 70 human F-box proteins have been identified. F-box proteins contain an F-box, which binds the rest of the SCF complex, and a substrate binding domain, which gives the E3 its substrate specificity.

==Mono- and poly-ubiquitylation ==

Ubiquitin signaling relies on the diversity of ubiquitin tags for the specificity of its message. A protein can be tagged with a single ubiquitin molecule (monoubiquitylation), or variety of different chains of ubiquitin molecules (polyubiquitylation). E3 ubiquitin ligases catalyze polyubiquitination events much in the same way as the single ubiquitylation mechanism, using instead a lysine residue from a ubiquitin molecule currently attached to substrate protein to attack the C-terminus of a new ubiquitin molecule. For example, a common 4-ubiquitin tag, linked through the lysine at position 48 (K48) recruits the tagged protein to the proteasome, and subsequent degradation. However, all seven of the ubiquitin lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63), as well as the N-terminal methionine are used in chains in vivo.

Monoubiquitination has been linked to membrane protein endocytosis pathways. For example, phosphorylation of the Tyrosine at position 1045 in the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) can recruit the RING type E3 ligase c-Cbl, via an SH2 domain. C-Cbl monoubiquitylates EGFR, signaling for its internalization and trafficking to the lysosome.

Monoubiquitination also can regulate cytosolic protein localization. For example, the E3 ligase MDM2 ubiquitylates p53 either for degradation (K48 polyubiquitin chain), or for nuclear export (monoubiquitylation). These events occur in a concentration dependent fashion, suggesting that modulating E3 ligase concentration is a cellular regulatory strategy for controlling protein homeostasis and localization.

== Substrate recognition ==
Ubiquitin ligases are the final, and potentially the most important determinant of substrate specificity in ubiquitination of proteins. The ligases must simultaneously distinguish their protein substrate from thousands of other proteins in the cell, and from other (ubiquitination-inactive) forms of the same protein. This can be achieved by different mechanisms, most of which involve recognition of degrons: specific short amino acid sequences or chemical motifs on the substrate.

=== N-degrons ===
Proteolytic cleavage can lead to exposure of residues at the N-terminus of a protein. According to the N-end rule, different N-terminal amino acids (or N-degrons) are recognized to a different extent by their appropriate ubiquitin ligase (N-recognin), influencing the half-life of the protein. For instance, positively charged (Arg, Lys, His) and bulky hydrophobic amino acids (Phe, Trp, Tyr, Leu, Ile) are recognized preferentially and thus considered destabilizing degrons since they allow faster degradation of their proteins.

=== Phosphodegrons ===

A degron can be converted into its active form by a post-translational modification such as phosphorylation of a tyrosine, serine or threonine residue. In this case, the ubiquitin ligase exclusively recognizes the phosphorylated version of the substrate due to stabilization within the binding site. For example, FBW7, the F-box substrate recognition unit of an SCFFBW7ubiquitin ligase, stabilizes a phosphorylated substrate by hydrogen binding its arginine residues to the phosphate, as shown in the figure to the right. In absence of the phosphate, residues of FBW7 repel the substrate.

=== Oxygen and small molecule dependent degrons ===
The presence of oxygen or other small molecules can influence degron recognition. The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein (substrate recognition part of a specific E3 ligase), for instance, recognizes the hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-α) only under normal oxygen conditions, when its proline is hydroxylated. Under hypoxia, on the other hand, HIF-a is not hydroxylated, evades ubiquitination and thus operates in the cell at higher concentrations which can initiate transcriptional response to hypoxia. Another example of small molecule control of protein degradation is phytohormone auxin in plants. Auxin binds to TIR1 (the substrate recognition domain of SCFTIR1ubiquitin ligase) increasing the affinity of TIR1 for its substrates (transcriptional repressors: Aux/IAA), and promoting their degradation.

=== Misfolded and sugar degrons ===
In addition to recognizing amino acids, ubiquitin ligases can also detect unusual features on substrates that serve as signals for their destruction. For example, San1 (Sir antagonist 1), a nuclear protein quality control in yeast, has a disordered substrate binding domain, which allows it to bind to hydrophobic domains of misfolded proteins. Misfolded or excess unassembled glycoproteins of the ERAD pathway, on the other hand, are recognized by Fbs1 and Fbs2, mammalian F-box proteins of E3 ligases SCFFbs1and SCFFbs2. These recognition domains have small hydrophobic pockets allowing them to bind high-mannose containing glycans.

=== Structural motifs ===
In addition to linear degrons, the E3 ligase can in some cases also recognize structural motifs on the substrate. In this case, the 3D motif can allow the substrate to directly relate its biochemical function to ubiquitination. This relation can be demonstrated with TRF1 protein (regulator of human telomere length), which is recognized by its corresponding E3 ligase (FBXO4) via an intermolecular beta sheet interaction. TRF1 cannot be ubiquinated while telomere bound, likely because the same TRF1 domain that binds to its E3 ligase also binds to telomeres.

== Disease relevance ==

E3 ubiquitin ligases regulate homeostasis, cell cycle, and DNA repair pathways, and as a result, a number of these proteins are involved in a variety of cancers, including famously MDM2, BRCA1, and Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor. For example, a mutation of MDM2 has been found in stomach cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and liver cancer (amongst others) to deregulate MDM2 concentrations by increasing its promoter’s affinity for the Sp1 transcription factor, causing increased transcription of MDM2 mRNA. Several proteomics-based experimental techniques are available for identifying E3 ubiquitin ligase-substrate pairs, such as proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID), ubiquitin ligase-substrate trapping, and tandem ubiquitin-binding entities (TUBEs).

===Examples===
* A RING (&quot;R&quot;eally &quot;I&quot;nteresting &quot;N&quot;ew &quot;G&quot;ene) domain binds the E2 conjugase and might be found to mediate enzymatic activity in the E2-E3 complex 
* An F-box domain (as in the SCF complex) binds the ubiquitinated substrate. (e.g., Cdc 4, which binds the target protein Sic1; Grr1, which binds Cln).
* A HECT domain, which is involved in the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the substrate.

<doc id="622572" wikidata="Q5146995" url="?curid=622572" title="Collegiate wrestling">
<text>Collegiate wrestling, commonly referred to as folkstyle wrestling, is the form of wrestling practiced at the post-secondary level in the United States. This style of wrestling is also practiced at the high school, middle school, and elementary levels with some modifications. The rules and style of collegiate/folkstyle wrestling differ from the Olympic styles of freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling. There are collegiate wrestling programs in almost all U.S. states, and one university in Canada.

Women&#x27;s wrestling at the U.S. college level uses two different rulesets. The National Wrestling Coaches Association, whose women&#x27;s division is now recognized by the NCAA as part of its Emerging Sports for Women program, uses the freestyle ruleset as defined by the sport&#x27;s international governing body, United World Wrestling. The National Collegiate Wrestling Association, a separate governing body that conducts competition for colleges and universities parallel to but outside the scope of the NCAA, uses collegiate rules in its women&#x27;s division.

Collegiate and freestyle wrestling, unlike Greco-Roman, also both allow the use of the wrestler&#x27;s or his opponent&#x27;s legs in offense and defense.

==Contrast with the international styles==
Collegiate wrestling differs in a number of ways from freestyle and Greco-Roman.

There are some scoring differences. For example, in collegiate wrestling, &quot;exposure&quot; points are not given to a wrestler for simply forcing the opponent&#x27;s shoulders to quickly rotate and be exposed to the mat. Instead, for example, a wrestler must control one of the opponent&#x27;s shoulders on the mat and have the opponent&#x27;s other shoulder forced to the mat at an angle of 45 degrees or less for two to five seconds to score. The points generated in this situation are called &quot;near fall&quot; points. This shows a difference in focus: while the international styles encourage explosive action and risk, collegiate wrestling encourages and rewards control over the opponent.

This emphasis on control was present in collegiate wrestling from its earliest days. Since 1915, collegiate wrestling officials have recorded the time that each participant had in controlling his opponent on the mat (known as &quot;time advantage&quot; or &quot;riding time&quot;). Early on, this was the major way to determine the winner in the absence of a fall. Over time, the significance of such timekeeping has declined, and now such &quot;time advantage&quot; only counts for one point in college competition at the most. As in both of the international styles, a wrestler can win the match by pinning both of his opponent&#x27;s shoulders or both of his opponent&#x27;s scapulae (shoulder blades) to the mat.

In collegiate wrestling, there is an additional position to commence wrestling after the first period, and also to resume wrestling after various other situations. All three styles begin a match with both wrestlers facing each other on their feet; known as the neutral position with the opportunity given to both to score a takedown and thus gain control over the opponent. In collegiate wrestling, once a takedown is scored, the wrestler under control in the inferior (defensive or bottom) position remains there until he escapes the move, until he reverses the position, until the period ends, or until various penalty situations occur. The inferior position is one possible choice for a starting position in the second and third periods, known as the &quot;referee&#x27;s position&quot;. The referee&#x27;s position is roughly analogous to the &quot;par terre&quot; starting position in the international wrestling styles. In the international styles, the &quot;par terre&quot; starting position is not utilized as often as the referee&#x27;s position is in collegiate wrestling. In the two international styles, the inferior position in the &quot;par terre&quot; starting position is now used to penalize a wrestler who has committed an illegal act.

In collegiate wrestling, there is a de-emphasis on &quot;throws&quot;, or maneuvers where the other wrestler is taken off his feet, taken through the air, and lands on his back or shoulders. This lack of emphasis on throws is another example of how collegiate wrestling emphasizes dominance or control, as opposed to the element of risk and explosive action. A legal throw in collegiate wrestling is awarded the same number of points as any other takedown. In freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling, points awarded for a wrestler&#x27;s takedowns increase with the level of explosiveness seen in the throws. Well-executed throws can even win a period in the international styles, especially when a throw is of grand amplitude (a throw in which a wrestler takes an opponent off of the mat and controls his opponent so that his feet go directly above his head). In collegiate wrestling, some of the throws seen in the international styles may even be illegal, such as a full-back suplex from a rear standing position. However, many collegiate wrestlers still incorporate some throws into their repertoire of moves because a thrown opponent often lands on his back or shoulders and thus in a position more conducive to producing near fall points or securing a fall.

Generally, rather than lifting the opponent or throwing him for grand amplitude in order to win the period as in the international styles, the collegiate wrestler most often seeks to take his opponent down to the mat and perform a &quot;breakdown&quot; (that is, to get his opponent in the defensive position flat on his stomach or side). With the opponent off of his base of support (that is, off of his hands and knees), the collegiate wrestler in the offensive position would then seek to run pinning combinations, or combinations of techniques designed to secure a fall. Failing to gain a fall could still result in an advantage in riding time and potential nearfall points.

The defensive wrestler could counter such attempts for a takedown, or when once taken down try to escape his opponent&#x27;s control or reverse control altogether. In a last-ditch attempt to foil a fall, the defensive wrestler could also &quot;bridge&quot; out of his opponent&#x27;s control (that is, pry his head, his back, and both of his feet up from the mat and then turn toward his stomach). Overall, a collegiate wrestler in his techniques would most likely emphasize physical control and dominance over the opponent on the mat.

==History==
===American wrestling in the early colonial era===
There were already wrestling styles among Native Americans varying from tribe and nation by the 15th and 16th centuries, when the first Europeans settled. The English and French who settled on the North American continent sought out wrestling as a popular pastime. Soon, there were local champions in every settlement, with contests between them on a regional level. The colonists in what would become the United States started out with something more akin to Greco-Roman wrestling, but soon found that style too restrictive in favor of a style with a greater allowance of holds. 
The Irish were known for their &quot;collar-and-elbow&quot; style, a variant of jacket wrestling (which was popular across Europe), in which wrestlers at the start of the match would grasp each other by the collar with one hand and by the elbow with the other. From this position, wrestlers sought to achieve a fall. If no fall occurred, the wrestlers would continue grappling both standing on their feet and on the ground until a fall was made. Irish immigrants later brought this style to the United States where it soon became widespread.

The Cornish were well known for their style of wrestling (another variant of jacket wrestling), Cornish wrestling, and this style became very popular in the US, Australia, New Zealand, Britain and South Africa. Many world champions came from the US, such as Jack Carkeek.

Other British wrestling included the backhold styles (Cumberland Wrestling and Scottish Backhold) and what became known as &quot;catch-as-catch-can&quot; wrestling, which had a particular following in Great Britain and the variant developed in Lancashire had a particular effect on future freestyle wrestling in particular.

===18th and 19th century United States===
By the 18th century, wrestling soon became recognized as a legitimate spectator sport, despite its roughness. Among those who were well known for their wrestling techniques were several U.S. Presidents. Since &quot;catch-as-catch-can&quot; wrestling was very similar, it gained great popularity in fairs and festivals in the United States during the 19th century. The collar-and-elbow style was also refined by later Irish immigrants, and gained great ground because of the success of George William Flagg from Vermont, the wrestling champion of the Army of the Potomac. After the Civil War, freestyle wrestling began to emerge as a distinct sport, and soon spread rapidly in the United States. Professional wrestling also emerged in the late 19th century (not like the &quot;sports-entertainment&quot; seen today). By the 1880s, American wrestling became organized, with matches often being conducted alongside gymnastic meets and boxing tournaments in athletic clubs. The growth of cities, industrialization, and the closing of the frontier provided the necessary avenue for sports such as wrestling to increase in popularity.

===20th century===

In 1903, the first intercollegiate dual meet took place between Yale and Columbia University. 

Two years later, in 1905, the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association held its first tournament, which sparked many more wrestling tournaments at both the collegiate and high school levels.

Edward C. Gallagher, a football and track and field athlete at Oklahoma A&amp;M College (now Oklahoma State University), launched wrestling as an official varsity sport just before World War I and with his team launched a dynasty, with undefeated matches from 1921 to 1931. In 1928, the first NCAA Wrestling Championships took place on March 30 to 31 on the campus of Iowa State College.

The rules of collegiate wrestling marked a sharp contrast to the freestyle wrestling rules of the International Amateur Wrestling Federation (IAWF)]. From then on, collegiate wrestling emerged as a distinctly American sport. College and high school wrestling grew especially after the standardization of the NCAA wrestling rules, which applied early on to both collegiate and scholastic wrestling (with high school modifications). More colleges, universities, and junior colleges began offering dual meets and tournaments, including championships and having organized wrestling seasons. There were breaks in wrestling seasons because of World War I and World War II, but in the high schools especially, state association wrestling championships sprung up in different regions throughout the 1930s and 1940s. As amateur wrestling grew after World War II, various collegiate athletic conferences also increased the number and quality of their wrestling competition, with more wrestlers making the progression of wrestling in high school, being recruited by college coaches, and then entering collegiate competition.

For most of the 20th century, collegiate wrestling was the most popular form of amateur wrestling in the United States, especially in the Midwest and the Southwest regions. The 1960s and 1970s saw major developments in collegiate wrestling, with the emergence of the United States Wrestling Federation (USWF) (now known as USA Wrestling (USAW)). The USWF, with its membership of coaches, educators, and officials, became recognized eventually as the official governing body of American wrestling and as the official representative to the United States Olympic Committee, in place of the Amateur Athletic Union.

Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada has competed in NAIA wrestling since 1977, consistently producing individual champions, All-Americans, and winning the team title twice (1988, 1993). SFU made history in 2009 by becoming the first non-American NCAA member school, with their wrestling program participating in U Sports for Olympic styles and NAIA for collegiate.

Collegiate wrestling teams compete in the NCAA national wrestling championships every year in each of the three divisions. The NAIA, NJCAA, and NCWA hold annual national wrestling championships as well. National Champion and All-American individual honors are awarded at the national championships in each of the 10 college weight classes, as well as a team title.

==Weight classes==

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is the organization that regulates collegiate wrestling. The wrestling rules developed by the NCAA are followed by each of the NCAA&#x27;s three divisions. In addition, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA), and the National Collegiate Wrestling Association (NCWA) have also adopted them, with some modifications. The NCAA generally sets the standard for weight classes for college-level dual meets, multiple duals, and tournaments. There are 10 main weight classes currently open to college-level competition, ranging from 125 lb to the Heavyweight division that ranges from 183 lb to 285 lb. There is also 235 lb weight class, which only the National Collegiate Wrestling Association, the organization that governs college wrestling for institutions outside the NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA, currently allows that ranges from 174 lb to 235 lb. The NCWA also allows eight weight classes for women ranging from 105 lb to 200 lb. A wrestler must normally have his weight assessed by a member of the institution&#x27;s athletics medical staff (e.g. a physician, certified athletic trainer, or registered dietician) before the first official team practice. The weight assessed is then his minimum weight class. The athletics medical staff member and the head coach then review all of the assessed weights of the wrestling team members and certify them online at the website of the National Wrestling Coaches Association (NWCA). After the certification, the wrestler may not compete below that weight class and may only compete at one weight class higher than his minimum weight.

If a wrestler does gain weight over his certified weight class and wrestles at two weight classes above it, he forfeits his previous lowest weight class for the one weight class below where he wrestled. If a contestant wishes to weigh-in and wrestle at only one weight class above his certified weight class and later return to his lowest certified weight class, he may do so. However, the wrestler may only return to that certified weight class according to the weight-loss plan of the National Wrestling Coaches Association. This weight loss plan takes into account potential dehydration during the wrestling season and minimum amounts of body fat.

All of this has been done in order to protect the wrestler&#x27;s health and safety.

==Season structure==
The collegiate wrestling season customarily runs from October or November to March. Regular season competition begins in late October or early November and continues until February. Post-season competition usually continues from February to March (depending on, if individual wrestlers or teams qualify for a conference, regional, or national championship). Normally, wrestling teams from two different colleges or universities would compete in what is known as a dual meet. It is possible for there also to be a multiple dual, where more than two wrestling teams compete against each other at the same event on the same day. For example, one college wrestling team may face another wrestling team for the first dual, and then a third wrestling team for the second dual. Also, those two wrestling teams may compete against each other in a dual meet as well. Colleges and universities often compete within their particular athletic conference; though competition outside a team&#x27;s conference or even outside its division within the NCAA is not uncommon.

===Dual meets===

Dual meets usually take place on evenings during the school week (Monday through Friday); on Saturday mornings, afternoons, or evenings; or even on Sunday mornings or afternoons during the wrestling season and begin with weigh-ins at a maximum of one hour before the meet begins. No weight allowances are made for dual meets and multiple-day dual meets. Wrestlers are also examined by a physician or a certified athletic trainer for any communicable skin diseases. If a student-wrestler does not make weight, he is ineligible for that weight class and a forfeit is scored. If there are any communicable skin diseases, it is a ground for disqualification. The wrestler&#x27;s coach or athletic trainer can provide written documentation from a physician that a skin infection of a wrestler would not be communicable. The final judgement for whether a wrestler would be allowed to compete lies with the meet physician or athletic trainer on site.

In all cases, after determining the sequence of weight classes for the dual meet, the referee will call the wrestlers from each team who have been designated as captains. One of the visiting captains will call a disk toss. The colored disk will then fall to the floor and determine: 1) which team has the choice of position at the start of the second period and 2) which one of the team&#x27;s members is to appear first on the mat when called by the referee for each weight class. The wrestler-captain who won the disk toss may choose the even or odd weight classes. That is, he may choose the weight classes, from lowest to highest, that are numbered evenly or oddly. For example, the 125 lb, 141 lb, 157 lb, etc. weight classes would be odd, and the 133 lb, 149 lb, 165 lb, etc. weight classes would be even. This order would work in the traditional sequence until the last even weight class of 285 lb.

During a dual meet, the top varsity wrestlers usually compete against each other. There can also be junior varsity matches, such as in Iowa, which are rare, that would take place immediately before the varsity matches. Also, before both varsity (and junior varsity) competition, there can also be an exhibition match in one or more weight classes. The exhibition matches do not count towards the varsity (or junior varsity) team score, but such matches allow wrestlers, especially at the freshmen level, to gain more competitive experience. Wrestling matches usually proceed in each of the 10 weight classes. The order the matches occur in is determined after the weigh-ins either by a mutual decision of the coaches or by a random draw choosing a particular weight class to be featured first. In either case, the succeeding wrestling matches will follow in sequence. For example, if the 157 lb weight class competes first, the succeeding wrestling matches will follow until the heavyweight class. Then, beginning at 125 lb, the rest of the matches will follow until the 149 lb match.

===Tournaments===
Often, many colleges and universities in the United States will compete with their teams in what is known as a tournament. In the tournament, from eight, 16, 32, 64, 75, or more individual wrestlers/teams can compete in each bracket. This allows many schools to establish their rankings, not only for individual student-wrestlers, but also for college and university wrestling teams as a whole, such as a conference or regional championship, or the NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships. A tournament committee usually administers the event and after individual and team entries have been verified, the officials then determine the order of the matches, called &quot;drawing&quot;, by certain brackets, such as brackets of eight or 16. When doing this, the tournament officials doing the drawing take into account each wrestler&#x27;s win–loss record, previous tournament placements, and other factors that indicate the wrestler&#x27;s ability. With that in mind, wrestlers who are noticed as having the most superior records are bracketed so that two top-ranked superior wrestlers in each weight class do not compete against each other in an early round. This is called seeding.

Tournaments are often sponsored by a college or university and are usually held on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or over any of two days within the weekend. Admission is often charged to cover costs and make a small profit for the host. A tournament begins with weigh-ins starting two hours or less before competition begins on the first day or one hour or less before competitions begins on any subsequent day. An allowance of one pound is granted for each subsequent day of the tournament.
With the drawing and weigh-ins completed, wrestlers then compete in two brackets in each of the 10 weight classes. If there are not enough wrestlers to fill up the bracket in a weight class, a bye will be awarded to a wrestler who does not have to compete against another wrestler in his pairing. After taking account the number of byes, the first round in each weight class then begins. Most college wrestling tournaments are in double elimination format. The last two wrestlers in the upper (championship) bracket wrestle for first place in the finals, with the loser winning second place. A wrestler cannot place higher than third if he is knocked down to the lower (wrestle-back) bracket by losing in the championship semi-finals. This is largely the result of time constraints: one-day tournaments often last into the evening.

If the winner of the wrestle-back bracket were allowed to challenge the winner of the championship bracket in the championship, the tournament could continue well past midnight before finishing.

After the first match of the round of 16 in a championship bracket in each weight class, the wrestle-back rounds would then commence, beginning among all of the wrestlers who lost to the winners of the round of 16. The winner of the wrestle-back finals would then win third place, with the loser winning fourth place. In tournaments where six places are awarded, the losers of the wrestle-back semi-finals would wrestle for fifth place, with the loser winning sixth place. If eight places are awarded, the losers of the wrestle-back quarterfinals would wrestle for seventh place, with the loser winning eighth place, and so on. After the championships finals, the awards ceremony usually takes place with plaques, medals, trophies, or other awards given to the individual and team winners with the highest placements. Precise rules for tournaments may vary from one event to the next.

Each intercollegiate athletic conference or geographic area features two or three &quot;elite&quot; tournaments every year. These events are by invitation only. Hence, the commonly used name for them, Invitationals. Tournament sponsors (which are usually colleges and universities, but sometimes other organizations) invite the best varsity wrestlers from their area to compete against each other. Many elite tournaments last two or even three days. For this reason, elite tournaments are often scheduled during the college&#x27;s or university&#x27;s winter break.

Between one season and the next, postseason tournaments and preseason tournaments are often held in collegiate wrestling and also in freestyle and Greco-Roman. The most active wrestlers often take part in those to sharpen their skills and techniques. Also, clinics and camps are often held for both wrestlers and their coaches to help refresh old techniques and gain new strategies. College wrestlers often serve as referees, volunteer coaches, assistants, or as counselors during many of the camps, clinics, and tournaments held during the off-season.

==Layout of the mat==
The match takes place on a thick rubber mat that is shock-absorbing to ensure safety. A large outer circle between 32 and 42 feet in diameter that designates the wrestling area is marked on the mat. The circumference line of that circle is called the boundary line. The wrestling area is surrounded by a mat area or apron (or protection area) that is at least five inches in width that helps prevent serious injury. The mat area is designated by the use of contrasting colors or a line, which is part of the wrestling area and included in bounds. The wrestlers are within bounds when any part of either wrestler is on or inside this boundary line.

The mat can be no thicker than four inches nor thinner than a mat with the shock-absorbing qualities of a hair-felt mat. Inside the outer circle is usually an inner circle about 10 feet in diameter, designated by the use of contrasting colors or a line, although this is no longer specified by the &quot;NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations&quot;. Wrestlers are encouraged to stay near the center of the mat within the inner circle, or else they risk being penalized for stalling (that is, deliberately attempting to slow down the action of the match or backing away from the opponent so they cannot score). Each wrestler begins action at one of two one-inch starting lines inside the inner circle that is three feet long. Two one-inch lines close the ends of the starting lines and are marked red for the wrestler from the visiting team and green for the wrestler from the home team. The two starting lines are 10 inches apart from each other and form a rectangle in the middle of the wrestling area. This rectangle designates the starting positions for the three periods. Additional padding may be added under the mat to protect the wrestlers, especially if the wrestlers are competing on a concrete floor. All mats that are in sections are secured together.

==Equipment==

* A singlet is a one-piece wrestling garment made of spandex that should provide a tight and comfortable fit for the wrestler. It is made from nylon or lycra and prevents an opponent from using anything on the wrestler as leverage. The singlets are usually light or dark depending on whether the wrestlers are competing at home or abroad, and they are usually designed according to the institution&#x27;s or club&#x27;s team colors. Wrestlers also have the option of wearing leggings with their singlets. Recently, some college wrestlers have begun to wear short-sleeved, tight-fitting shirts with accompanying shorts made out of spandex or lycra. 
* A special pair of wrestling shoes is worn by a wrestler to increase his mobility and flexibility. Wrestling shoes are light and flexible in order to provide maximum comfort and movement. Usually made with rubber soles, they help give the wrestler&#x27;s feet a better grip on the mat. 
* Wrestling headgear, equipment worn around the ears to protect them, is mandatory in collegiate wrestling. Headgear is worn to decrease the participant&#x27;s own risk for injury, as there is the potential to develop cauliflower ear.
* In addition, special equipment, such as face masks, braces, mouthguards, hair coverings, knee pads, or elbow pads may be worn by either wrestler. Anything worn that prevents normal movement or execution of holds is prohibited.

== Injuries and infections ==
Injuries and infections are not uncommon in the sport of wrestling since there is so much contact. Also, infections occur frequently due to body secretions (sweat, saliva, and blood).

Concussions

Common ways of getting concussions are any head-to-head hits or any hits that involve a hard blow to the skull. Every year nearly 135,000 children ranging from age 5 to 18 are treated for concussions and other head injures from sports or other recreational activities. Many concussions come from sports such as wrestling, football, boxing and any other sport that risks getting hit in the head. Wearing headgear can help prevent concussions. Also wearing a frontal pad that protects the forehead and top of the head is very effective in protecting the head from a hit that may cause a concussion. Wearing a mouth piece can help prevent concussions as well.

Cauliflower ear

Cauliflower ear is a blood clot that forms under the skin in the ear, causing there to be a large bump in the ear; the bump tends to be extremely hard. To develop cauliflower ear one must be hit in the ear many times or hit hard for it to form into a blood clot. When having cauliflower ear it is important to get the ear drained of fluid that has built up, otherwise it will harden. Once the cauliflower ear has hardened, the ear will require surgery to return to normal shape and size. The best way to prevent cauliflower is to wear protective headgear.

Ligament injuries

Knee ligament injuries are a common injury in wrestling. One common one is being injury to the Medial collateral ligament which is also known as the MCL and is located on the inside. Another common injury to the knee is on the outside Lateral Collateral Ligament which is known as the LCL. Leg or knee injuries are commonly caused by over twisting the leg outward from the middle of the body.

Sprains and strains

Ankle sprains and wrist sprains are common in wrestling. Ankle sprains typically occur from twisting the ankle and injuring the ligaments within the ankle. Wrist sprains occur from falling hard on the wrist and damaging the ligaments in the wrist.

Prepatellar bursitis

This is caused by the inflammation of a sac in the front of the knee cap which swells up and can be painful. Preventing this can be done by wearing a knee pad to help reduce impact on the knee.

Overtraining syndrome

This is caused by overexerting. The body symptoms are fatigue, lack of motivation, losing body weight, decreased performance, depression, insomnia and immune system weakening. This can affect the athlete mentally as well as physically.

Skin disease

Taking showers regularly, wearing clean clothes for practice, and mopping the mats with an antiseptic solution will help prevent spread and growth of diseases

Impetigo

Impetigo is a highly contagious skin infection. It appears as red or yellowish bumps and sores that are clustered together which may increase in size. The sores can burst which then crust over with a yellowish or brownish scab. This infection can be spread by coming into contact with a person who has the infection. Another way to contract impetigo is by touching or using equipment or from the mats that are infected by the bacteria. If impetigo is left untreated other infections could occur which can cause serious health issues. The bumps cause no pain although they may be itchy. Once the blisters pop they crust over with a yellow brownish scab but they can still be red and itchy. The Mayo clinic states that &quot;Classic signs and symptoms of impetigo involve red sores that quickly rupture, ooze for a few days and then form a yellowish-brown crust. The sores usually occur around the nose and mouth but can be spread to other areas of the body by fingers, clothing and towels&quot;. Impetigo comes from a bacterium known as staphylococcus aureus.
* Certain sports. Participating in sports like wrestling and football where skin to skin contact is always happening you may increase your risk of developing a skin infection.
MRSA

MRSA is an infection that has a resistance to certain antibiotics. MRSA stands for Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus, which is a form of a staph. Any athlete who develops a skin infection should be checked by doctor immediately. Also, one should resist trying to give themselves care. When treating MRSA abscesses, medical professionals tend to make an incision and drain the infected area. MRSA can become life-threatening if it reaches the blood stream or causes pneumonia; it also can cause infections on surgical sites that can cause major complications.

Ringworm

This is a fungal or yeast infection on the skin in the shape of a circle. It appears to be red and the outer ring may be slightly raised. The infection grows while in warm moist places and tends to be itchy. One can contract the infection by touching the area that is infected or items that are contaminated.

Herpetic lesions

These lesions are all Type one infections also known specifically as Herpes simplex, Herpes Zoster, and Herpes Gladiatorial; are all types of herpes that are common in skin to skin contact sports. Type two herpes is known as herpes on the genitals which is spread through sexual contact. These lesions come from skin to skin contact or body secretions. The skin starts to develop blisters which can happen anywhere on the body. To return to any activity one must be cleared by a doctor. Herpes Simplex is the virus that causes cold sores; this virus can be spread by oral secretions and can also cause Herpes Gladiatorum. Once a person becomes infected the virus stays in the body forever and can reactivate itself anytime causing cold sores. Herpes Gladiatorum is a skin infection. It comes from the Herpes Simplex virus which causes the same lesion one has when they have a cold sore. This form of herpes is on the skin and can be spread through contact with others or sharing beverages with someone who is infected or using anything that they may have contaminated. This virus remains in your system and can reactivate itself at any time causing lesions to appear. Herpes Zoster is the virus which causes shingles and chicken pox. Once one has had the chicken pox one carries the virus forever. Once one has chicken pox the virus is inactive but, if it becomes active again, it&#x27;s known as shingles.

==The match==

A match is a competition between two individual wrestlers of the same weight class. The match consists of three periods totaling seven minutes in college matches (with an overtime round if necessary if the score is tied at the end of regulation).

The main official at the wrestling match is the referee, who is in full control in matters of judgement at the competition and is responsible for starting and stopping the match; observing all holds; signaling points; calling penalties such as illegal holds, unnecessary roughness, fleeing the mat, or flagrant misconduct; and finally observing a full view of and determining the fall. There can also be one assistant referee (especially at tournaments) that helps the referee with making any difficult decisions and in preventing error. Also, scorers are there to record the points of the two individual wrestlers. Finally, a match or meet timekeeper with assistant timekeepers are present to note the match time, timeouts, and time advantage and work with the scorers.

===Period format===
*Pre-match
Each wrestler is called by the referee, steps onto the mat, and may put on a green for the home team or red for the visiting team anklet about three inches wide which the referee will use to indicate scoring. The referee then prepares the wrestlers to begin the first period.

*First period
The referee prepares both wrestlers for the first period by making sure each wrestler is correctly in the neutral position. The First period lasts 3 minutes long. This is the longest period of the match. The neutral position has the two wrestlers standing opposite each other on their feet. Each wrestler starts with his lead foot on the green or red area of the starting lines, and his other foot even with or behind the lead foot. Both wrestlers then usually slightly crouch with their arms in front of them at or above waist level. In this position, neither wrestler is in control. When the referee is certain that both wrestlers are correctly in the neutral position, he blows the whistle to begin the first period (as well as whenever wrestling is resumed, such as at the beginning of the second and third periods, when contestants resume wrestling after going out of bounds, etc.). The match commences with each wrestler attempting to &quot;take down&quot; his opponent. The first period in college and university matches is three minutes long.

*Second period
The Second and Third period last 2 minutes each, where each wrestler will have their choice of position in each. If the match is not ended by a fall, technical fall, default, or disqualification, the referee then prepares both wrestlers to begin the second period. After the first period ends, one wrestler will have the choice of starting position in the second period. In dual meets, this is determined by the colored disk toss that took place before the meet began. In tournaments, the referee will toss a colored disk, with a green-colored side and a red-colored side, and the winner of that disk toss will have the choice of position. The wrestler could choose between the neutral position, or as is most commonly chosen to begin in the referee&#x27;s position on the mat. The referee&#x27;s position has both wrestlers beginning action at the center of the mat with one wrestler (in the defensive starting position) on the bottom with his hands spread apart in front of the forward starting line and his knees spread apart behind the rear starting line with his legs held together. The other wrestler on the top (in the offensive starting position) then kneels beside him with one arm wrapped around the bottom wrestler&#x27;s waist (with the palm of his hand against the opponent&#x27;s navel) and the other hand on or over the back of the opponent&#x27;s near elbow for control. Most often, the wrestler with the choice chooses the defensive (bottom) position because of the relative ease of scoring an escape or reversal in comparison to a near fall. The wrestler could also defer his choice to the beginning of the third period.

More recently, another starting position choice has been allowed, known as the optional offensive starting position or optional start. After the wrestler with the choice (the offensive wrestler) indicates his intention to the referee, the referee lets the defensive wrestler adjust and begin in the defensive starting position. Next, the offensive wrestler goes to either side of the defensive wrestler or behind him, with all his weight supported by both his feet or by one or both knees. The offensive wrestler would then place both his hands on the opponent&#x27;s back between the neck and the waist. When the referee starts the match by blowing the whistle, the defensive wrestler then has the opportunity to get back to his feet in a neutral position. Any of the starting positions may be used to resume action during a period when the wrestlers go off the mat, depending on the referee&#x27;s judgment as to whether any or which wrestler had the position of advantage.

The second period is two minutes long.

*Third period
If the match is not ended by a fall, technical fall, default, or disqualification, the referee then prepares both wrestlers to begin the third period. The wrestler who did not choose the starting position for the second period now chooses the starting position. The third period is also two minutes long.

*First overtime round
::*Sudden victory period
If the third period ends in a tie, a one-minute, sudden victory period occurs. Both wrestlers start in the neutral position. The first wrestler to score a takedown wins. Time advantage is not used in any sudden victory period.

::*Tiebreaker periods
If no points are scored in the sudden victory period, or if the first points were scored simultaneously, two 30-second tiebreaker periods occur. Both wrestlers start in the referee&#x27;s position. The wrestler who scored the first points (besides escapes and penalty points) in regulation has the choice of top or bottom position. If the only points scored in regulation were for escapes or penalties, the choice of position will be given to the winner of a colored disk toss. After the wrestler makes his choice, the two contestants then wrestle. Either of the two wrestlers must try to score as many points as he can. Once one 30-second period is over, the wrestler who was in the bottom position then wrestles on the top in another 30-second period. Whoever scores the most points (or is awarded a fall, default, or disqualification) wins the match. Time advantage is kept, and points are awarded accordingly.

*Second overtime round
If no wrestler has won by the end of the two tiebreaker periods, a second overtime round starts with a one-minute, sudden victory period, and then two 30-second tiebreaker periods for each wrestler. The wrestler who did not have the choice of position in the previous overtime round&#x27;s first tiebreaker period now has the choice of position in this overtime round&#x27;s first tiebreaker period. If the score remains tied after the end of the second overtime round, the wrestler who has one second or more of net time advantage from the two rounds of tiebreaker periods will be declared the winner.

*Subsequent overtime 
If a winner still cannot be determined, overtime rounds that are structured like the second round of overtime take place until one wrestler scores enough points for the victory.

*Post-match
After the match is completed, regardless of the victory condition, the wrestlers will return to the center of the mat (on the 10-foot inner circle) while the referee checks with the scorer&#x27;s table. Upon the referee&#x27;s return to the mat, the two wrestlers shake hands, and the referee proclaims the winner by raising the winner&#x27;s hand. Both contestants then return to their team benches from the mat.

===Match scoring===

In collegiate wrestling, points are awarded mostly on the basis of control. Control occurs when a wrestler has gained restraining power over an opponent, usually, by controlling the opponent&#x27;s legs and torso. When a wrestler gains control and maintains restraining power over an opponent, he is said to be in a position of advantage. Scoring can be accomplished in the following ways:

* Takedown (3 points): A wrestler is awarded three points for a takedown when, from the neutral position, he gains control by taking the other wrestler down to the mat in-bounds and beyond reaction time. This is most often accomplished by attacking the legs of the opponent, although various throws can also be used to bring a wrestler down to the mat.

* Escape (1 point): A defensive wrestler being controlled on the bottom is awarded one point for an escape when the offensive wrestler loses control of the opponent while any part of either wrestler remains in bounds. An escape may be awarded when the wrestlers are still in contact.

* Reversal (2 points): A defensive wrestler who is being controlled on the bottom is awarded two points for a reversal when he comes from the bottom/defensive position and gains control of the opponent either on the mat or in a rear standing position. Reversal points are awarded on the edge of the wrestling area if control is established while any part of either wrestler remains in bounds.
* Near-fall: Near fall points are similar to the points awarded for exposure or the danger position in the international styles of wrestling, but the emphasis for near falls is on control, not risk. Near fall criteria are met when: (1) the offensive wrestler holds the defensive wrestler in a high bridge or on both elbows; (2) the offensive wrestler holds any part of both his opponent&#x27;s shoulders or scapulae (shoulder blades) within four inches of the mat; or (3) the offensive wrestler controls the defensive wrestler in such a way that one of the bottom wrestler&#x27;s shoulders or scapulae, or the head, is touching the mat, and the other shoulder or scapula is held at an angle of 45 degrees or less to the mat. The referee counts the seconds off. Only one near fall is scored for a wrestler using the same pinning combination, regardless of the number of times the offensive wrestler places the defensive wrestler in a near fall position during the situation. Near fall points are also known as &quot;back points.&quot; Much of the criteria for the near fall were used in a former scoring opportunity known as &quot;predicament&quot; in collegiate wrestling. When near fall points are given after the opponent is injured, signals an injury, or bleeds excessively, it is a consequence of what is sometimes referred to as the &quot;scream rule&quot;.

::(2 points): Two points are given when near-fall criteria are met for two to three seconds. Two points can also be granted in cases where a pinning combination is executed legally and a near-fall is imminent, still, the defensive wrestler is injured, signals an injury, or bleeds excessively before the near-fall criterion is met.

::(3 points): Three points are given when near fall criteria are met for three seconds. Three points can also be granted in cases where a pinning combination is executed legally and a near-fall is imminent, and the defensive wrestler is later injured, signals an injury, or bleeds excessively.
::(4 points): Four points are given when the criteria for a near-fall are met for four seconds, or the defensive wrestler is later injured, indicates an injury, or bleeds excessively.

* Penalty (1 or 2 points): One or two points can be awarded by the referee to the opponent for various penalty situations. &quot;Unsportsmanlike conduct&quot; by the wrestler includes swearing, teasing the opponent, etc. &quot;Unnecessary roughness&quot; involves physical acts during the match that exceed normal aggressiveness. &quot;Flagrant misconduct&quot; includes actions (physical or nonphysical) that intentionally attack the opponent, the opponent&#x27;s team, or others in a severe way. Illegal holds are also penalized accordingly, and potentially dangerous holds are not penalized, but the match will be stopped by the referee. Also, &quot;technical violations&quot; such as stalling, interlocking hands, and other minor infractions are penalized. With some situations, such as stalling or locking hands, a warning is given after the first occurrence, and if there is another occurrence the penalty point is given. In other situations, there is no warning and penalty points are automatically given. In general, after a certain number of occurrences where penalty points are given, the penalized wrestler is disqualified. A fuller treatment of the situations in which penalty points are awarded in college wrestling matches is found in the Penalty Table on pages WR-64 to WR-67 of the &quot;2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations&quot;.

* Imminent scoring: When a match is stopped for an injury during a scoring situation (e.g. a takedown, reversal, or escape), and the referee determines that scoring would have been successful if the wrestling had continued, an injury timeout is charged to the injured wrestler and the applicable points are given to his non-injured opponent. This is also a consequence of the scream rule.

* Time advantage or riding time (1 point): Whenever a wrestler is controlling an opponent on the mat in such a way that prevents an escape or a reversal, he is gaining time advantage (or riding time). An assistant timekeeper then records the time advantage of each wrestler throughout the match. At the end of the third period, one point is awarded to the wrestler with the greater time advantage, provided that the difference of time advantage between the two wrestlers is one minute or more. Points for time advantage are awarded only in college competition.

== Victory conditions ==

A match can be won in the following ways:
* Win by fall: The object of the entire wrestling match is to attain victory by what is known as the fall. A fall, also known as a pin, occurs when one wrestler holds any part of both of his opponent&#x27;s shoulders or both of his opponent&#x27;s scapulae (shoulder blades) in continuous contact with the mat for one second at the college level. The fall ends the match immediately, and the offensive wrestler who secured the fall is declared the winner. Falls (or pins) can be attained in many different ways. The most common way of securing the fall is through the various nelson holds, in particular, the half nelson. Other techniques used to secure falls are &quot;cradles&quot;, the &quot;headlock&quot; (&quot;head and arm&quot;), single or double &quot;armbars&quot; (&quot;bar arms&quot;), the &quot;back bow&quot; and the &quot;leg Turk&quot;, the &quot;reverse body lock&quot;, the &quot;guillotine&quot;, the &quot;leg split&quot; (also known as the &quot;banana split&quot; or &quot;spread eagle&quot;), the &quot;spladle&quot;, the &quot;figure-4 to the head&quot;, the &quot;straight body scissors&quot;, and the &quot;double grapevine&quot; (also called the &quot;Saturday night ride&quot;).

* Win by technical fall: If a fall is not secured to end the match, a wrestler can win a match simply by points. If a wrestler secures an advantage of 15 points over an opponent, the match ends immediately and the wrestler wins the match by technical fall. A technical fall is very likely when one wrestler has great control over the other wrestler and is able to score near fall points repeatedly. If the 15-point advantage is gained while the offensive wrestler has his opponent in a pinning situation, the match would continue to allow the offensive wrestler to secure the fall. If the offensive wrestler is unable to secure a fall, the match ends once a near fall situation is no longer seen by the referee or when the wrestlers return to the neutral position.

* Win by major decision: If no fall or technical fall occurs, a wrestler can also win simply by points. If the match concludes, and a wrestler has a margin of victory of eight or more points over an opponent, but under the 15 points needed for a technical fall, the win is known as a major decision. In team duals, a major decision will give a team four team points.
* Win by decision: If the match concludes, and a wrestler has a margin of victory of less than eight points over an opponent, or wins the first point in a sudden victory period in overtime without gaining a fall, default, or a win by an opponent&#x27;s disqualification, the wrestler then wins by decision.
* Win by default: If for any reason, a wrestler is unable to continue competing during the match (e.g. because of injury, illness, etc.), his opponent is awarded victory by default. A wrestler can concede a win by default to his opponent by informing the referee himself of his inability to continue wrestling. The decision to concede the win by default can also be made by the wrestler&#x27;s coach.

* Win by disqualification: If a wrestler is banned from participating further in a match by virtue of acquiring penalties or for flagrant misconduct, his opponent wins by disqualification.

* Win by forfeit: A wrestler also may gain a victory by forfeit when the other wrestler for some reason fails to appear for the match. In a tournament, the wrestler could also win by a medical forfeit if for some reason his opponent becomes ill or injured during the course of the tournament and decides not to continue wrestling. For a wrestler to win by forfeit or medical forfeit however, he must appear on the mat in a wrestling uniform. The existence of the forfeit condition encourages teams to have at least one varsity (and one junior varsity) competitor at every weight class. The wrestler who declared the medical forfeit is excused from further weigh-ins but is eliminated from further competition.

===Team scoring in dual meets===
On the college level in a dual meet, the wrestler not only wins the match for himself, but also gains points for his team. The number of points awarded to a team during a dual meet depends on the victory condition. It is possible for a team to lose team points in certain infractions, such as unsportsmanlike conduct, flagrant misconduct, team personnel illegally leaving the reserved zone around the mat, and unauthorized questioning of the referee by the coach.

====Summary of team scoring in a dual meet====

In a dual meet, when all team points are totaled, the team with the most points wins the competition. In all victory cases, if there are junior varsity matches, the junior varsity and varsity competitions are scored separately. If this is the case, it is entirely possible for one participating institution to win the junior varsity dual meet and another participating institution to win the varsity dual meet. On the college level, it is possible for a dual meet to end in a tie, except in dual meet advancement tournaments, where then the tie is broken by one team point awarded to the winning team based on certain criteria.

===Team scoring in tournaments===
In a tournament, most of the team points are scored for advancement. For example, a team winning a match in the championship bracket would be awarded one team advancement point; one-half of an advancement point would be awarded if a team won a match in the wrestle-back bracket (consolation bracket). The corresponding team points also apply if a wrestler from the team gained a bye and then won his next match in that bracket. Two additional advancement points are for victories by fall, default, disqualification, and forfeit (including victories by medical forfeit). One and one-half additional advancement points are awarded for victories by technical fall. One additional advancement point is awarded for victories by major decision. A team could then win a certain number of placement points if its wrestlers have placed individually in the championship and wrestle-back brackets. Thus, whole teams are awarded placements (first, second, etc.) based on their total number of victories.

Individual placement points are also awarded. For example, in a tournament scoring eight places, the winner of a quarterfinal or a semi-final in the championship bracket (where first and second places are awarded) would win six place points. The winners of first and second place would then win four additional place points. In the wrestle-back bracket (where third and fifth places are awarded), the winner of a semi-final match, for example, would receive three place points. The winners of third, fifth, and seventh place would receive one additional place point, and so on. A more detailed account of how individual and team points are awarded for tournaments is given on pages WR-49 to WR-51 of the &quot;2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations&quot;.

== Women&#x27;s collegiate wrestling ==
Women&#x27;s Collegiate Wrestling with the first women&#x27;s varsity team being created in 1993–94 at The University of Minnesota-Morris.  The start of the Women&#x27;s Collegiate Wrestling Association (WCWA) dates to the academic year 2007–2008, marking its formal establishment to govern the domain of women&#x27;s collegiate varsity wrestling.

There are currently 124 women&#x27;s college wrestling programs across multiple divisions 42 NAIA teams. 68 NCAA. 14 JUCO. 69 NCWA. and 7 D1 club teams. The sport of wrestling has proved to grow each year bringing in 1,941 athletes in 2022 with 1,651 men and 290 women.

==High school level==
The term scholastic wrestling is used to differentiate wrestling outside of the collegiate style of rules. It is applied when practiced at the high school and middle (junior high) school level. Although scholastic wrestling and collegiate wrestling are both commonly referred to as folkstyle wrestling. Scholastic wrestling rules differs from collegiate wrestling rules in multiple aspects. Scholastic wrestling is regulated by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS). This association mandates that high school matches are to have periods of shorter length, three periods consisting of two minutes each, than collegiate matches which begin with a three-minute first period. Additionally, college wrestling uses the concept of &quot;time advantage&quot; or &quot;riding time&quot; when one wrestler is in control of the other, while high school wrestling does not.

According to an Athletics Participation Survey taken by the National Federation of State High School Associations, boys&#x27; wrestling ranked eighth in terms of the number of schools sponsoring teams, with 9,445 schools participating in the 2006–07 school year. Also, 257,246 boys participated in the sport during that school year, making scholastic wrestling the sixth most popular sport among high school boys. In addition, 5,048 girls participated in wrestling in 1,227 schools during the 2006–07 season. Scholastic wrestling is practiced in all 50 states; with only Mississippi not having an official sanctioned scholastic wrestling championship for high schools. Arkansas, the 49th state to sanction a high school wrestling championship, began competition in the 2008–09 season.

==Youth age-group level==

At younger age group tournaments in the United States, independent tournaments are often run in &quot;folkstyle&quot;, along with freestyle and Greco-Roman styles. To differentiate this style from freestyle and Greco-Roman, the term folkstyle wrestling is a more commonly used phrase than collegiate wrestling at all age levels.

<text>The StoryTeller is a live-action/puppet television series that originally aired in 1987 and which was created and produced by Jim Henson.

Reruns of &quot;The StoryTeller&quot; episodes were featured in some episodes of &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot;.

==History==
The series retold various European folk tales, particularly ones considered obscure in Western culture, created with a combination of actors and puppets. The framing device had an old storyteller (John Hurt) sitting by a fire telling each tale to both the viewers and to his talking dog (a realistic looking puppet of a brown and blonde Pudelpointer performed and voiced by Brian Henson) who acted as the voice of the viewers, and was written in a language and traditional style in keeping with old folk tales.

In the &quot;Secret of the Muppets&quot; episode of &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot;, Jim Henson stated that the StoryTeller has a half-puppet appearance. Heavy make-up was used to create the character, notably large ears and a prosthetic nose, resembling the titular character from the children&#x27;s book by Roald Dahl, &quot;The BFG&quot;. The StoryTeller was initially conceived by Jim Henson as an animatronic puppet character. However, Ron Mueck filmed a test with facial prosthetics, to suggest that an actor in make-up would be more effective.

Henson, having worked with director Steve Barron on the music videos for David Bowie&#x27;s songs &quot;As the World Falls Down&quot; and &quot;Underground&quot; (both from Henson&#x27;s &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (1986)), was so impressed with Barron&#x27;s work that he invited him to direct several episodes of the series.

==Broadcast==
&quot;Hans My Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Fearnot&quot;, &quot;A Story Short&quot;, and &quot;The Luck Child&quot; aired (in that order) in the United States on NBC as standalone specials in January 1987, October 1987, January 1988, and April 1988, respectively. All nine episodes were then aired in the UK on Channel 4 between May and July 1988. &quot;The Heartless Giant&quot;, &quot;The Soldier and Death&quot;, &quot;The True Bride&quot;, and &quot;Sapsorrow&quot; first aired (in that order) in the US as part of &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot; on NBC, the first two in April 1989, the latter two in July 1989. &quot;The Three Ravens&quot; was included in the &quot;Jim Henson Hour&quot;&#x27;s twelfth episode, &quot;Food&quot;, but the series was cancelled before it had a chance to air. &quot;The Three Ravens&quot; was not shown in the US until 1997, when the entire series was rerun by HBO.

==The episodes==
===The Soldier and Death===
Taken from an early Russian folk tale retold in English by Arthur Ransome and is also inspired by &quot;Godfather Death&quot;. A soldier returns home after 20 years of war, with three biscuits in his knapsack. On his way he meets three beggars to whom he gives the biscuits; in return one gives him a ruby whistle, one the jolliest dance, and the final man, who gets the last biscuit despite the soldier being hungry himself, in return gives him a pack of magic playing cards and a musty sack that has the power to trap anything ordered into it. Using the sack, the soldier manages to trap a flock of geese, and so manages to feed himself. Upon arriving at an abandoned castle overrun with small devils, he plays them in a game of cards, winning 40 barrels of gold, and when they try to kill him, he captures them in the sack only letting them go when they promise to never return. He makes one of them swear to serve him and keeps its foot as leverage. Quickly becoming rich and famous because he removed the devils from a palace that is owned by the Tzar, his luck runs short when his son becomes deathly ill. Calling upon the devil, the soldier is given a glass goblet that allows the owner to see Death. If Death is at the foot of the person&#x27;s bed (as was the case with his son), he or she will recover if sprinkled with water from the goblet. If Death is at the head of the bed, nothing can be done. Then the Tzar becomes ill and the soldier, seeing Death at the head of his bed, makes a bargain with Death: his life in exchange for the Tzar&#x27;s. Death takes his offer and gives the illness to the soldier, curing the Tzar. Lying in his death bed, he summons Death into his sack and stops death from happening everywhere. But as time goes on, he sees people everywhere who are waiting for death that will not come. So he frees Death, who fears the soldier and his sack so much that he refuses to take the soldier&#x27;s life. The soldier, old and weary of life, seeks out a way to die. He travels down to the underworld, forcing the devils at the gates (the same ones from before) to give him two hundred souls and a map to heaven. Terrified of the sack, the devils agree to his demands. Upon reaching the gates of heaven, he asks to be let in with the souls while begging for forgiveness from God, but he is denied by the gatekeeper. He gives the sack to one of the souls, asking the soul to summon him into the sack when he has passed through the gates. But since there is no memory in heaven, the soul forgets and the soldier is condemned to live forever upon the Earth. In closing, the StoryTeller remarks (with a smile) that the soldier is still probably about his business. As the StoryTeller tosses the bag aside, a devil emerges from the bag unnoticed by the StoryTeller but noticed by the dog who dismisses it as his imagination.

The episode stars Bob Peck as the Soldier, John Franklyn-Robbins as the Tzar and Alistair Fullarton performs Death. The Devils are performed by David Barclay, Michael Bayliss, Marcus Clarke, Richard Coombs, John Eccleston, Geoff Foxx, Brian Henson, Mike Quinn, and Francis Wright while Tony Jackson, Peter Hawkins, and Peter Marinker voice the Devils.

This episode was directed by Jim Henson.

===Fearnot===
From an early German folk tale. The StoryTeller recounts the adventures of a boy who goes out into the world to learn what fear is, accompanied by a dishonest but loveable tinker. He faces many dangers without learning to be afraid, only to learn that fear is at home: the fear of losing his sweetheart.

This episode stars Reece Dinsdale as Fearnot, Gabrielle Anwar as his sweetheart, Willie Ross as the Tinker, Mr. McKoy, and Michael Cuckson as the Pond Sprite.

The episode was directed by Steve Barron.

===The Luck Child===
Featuring elements from the German folk tales &quot;The Griffin&quot; and &quot;The Devil with the Three Golden Hairs&quot;. The seventh son of a seventh son is born—a Luck Child. The wise men prophesy that someday he will be King. The cruel King hears about the prophecy, and plots to kill the child. With his chancellor by his side, he sweeps the countryside for the Luck Child. Taking him away from the boy&#x27;s biological parents, he pushes the chancellor and the child off a high cliff. While the chancellor becomes a meal for the Griffin, the boy survives since his swaddling safely unraveled him to the shore. He is found and raised by an elderly couple and is named Lucky. Years later, the King finds Lucky while inspecting a mill&#x27;s harvest. Recognizing him as the Luck Child after hearing the elderly couple&#x27;s tale, the King promptly hands the young man a proclamation to be delivered to his kingdom. Lost in the forest, Lucky stumbles into an underground den of thieves and meets a little man. The little man drugs the gullible Lucky, being skilled in the art of hiding his concoctions in goulash. Curious of his victim&#x27;s message, The Little Man reads the King&#x27;s proclamation: the King demands that the Queen have Lucky chopped into a thousand pieces. The Little Man pities Lucky and forges the King&#x27;s handwriting to change the youth&#x27;s fate--&quot;Marriage. Do this without delay&quot;. While Lucky is still unconscious, the Little Man drags him within eyesight of his destination. The King is enraged upon his return as he sees Lucky marrying his treasured daughter with his written approval. Claiming that the new groom must prove his worth, the king declares that Lucky must bring him a golden feather from the dreaded Griffin (a nigh impossible task as far as the king is concerned). Lucky sets for the island where the beast dwells and has a ferryman take him to his destination. The ferryman shares that he doesn&#x27;t know why he is forced to perform his task rowing back and forth across the blackened water without ending. So Lucky promises to find the answer. In the beast&#x27;s lair, he meets the Little Man from the forest who was saved and brought there by the Griffin due to his delicious cooking. The Little Man tells Lucky to hide, drugs the Griffin with his tampered goulash, plucks the golden feather for the boy, and persuades the creature to reveal the solution to the ferryman&#x27;s lament. As Lucky escapes while the Griffin sleeps, the youth takes a chest full of treasure on the shore of the island and returns triumphant. He explains to the ferryman to offer his pole to the next visitor in order to gain freedom. The King begrudgingly gives his blessing to marry the Princess, yet is soon enchanted by the jewels Lucky has brought back. His greed leads him to the Griffin&#x27;s island but he becomes impatient with the ferryman&#x27;s speed. The ferryman offers his pole and the King is given the ferryman&#x27;s previous fate as the ferryman is set free from his curse.

This episode stars Steven Mackintosh as the Luck Child, Philip Jackson as the King, Cathryn Bradshaw as the Princess, Pauline Moran as the Queen, Anthony O&#x27;Donnell as the Little Man, Robert Eddison as the Cursed Ferryman, and George Little as the voice of the Griffin (which is operated by Alistair Fullarton and Brian Henson).

The episode was directed by Jon Amiel.

===A Story Short===
From an early Celtic folk tale according to the creators of the series. Based on a folk tale with many variants worldwide. In an adaptation of the &quot;Stone Soup&quot; fable, the StoryTeller tells of a harsh time when he was forced to walk the land as a beggar. Finding himself in sight of the castle kitchen, he picks up a stone and fools the castle cook into helping him make soup from a stone, by adding it into a cauldron of water and slowly adding other ingredients to improve the flavour. When the cook realizes he has been swindled, he asks that the StoryTeller be boiled alive. As a compromise, the King promises to give the StoryTeller a gold crown for each story he tells for each day of the year - and to boil him if he fails. The StoryTeller does well at first, but on the final day, he awakens and can think of no story. In a panic he roams the castle grounds, running into a magical beggar who turns him into a flea. At the end of the day when the King calls for his story, the StoryTeller confesses he has no story, and instead tells the King the true tale of his adventures under the magic of the beggar that day.

This is the only episode where the StoryTeller himself plays a major part in the story he tells. The other actors include Brenda Blethyn as the StoryTeller&#x27;s wife, Bryan Pringle as the cook, Richard Vernon as the King, and John Kavanagh as the Beggar.

This episode was directed by Charles Sturridge.

===Hans My Hedgehog===
From an early German folk tale of the same name. A farmer&#x27;s wife drives her husband mad with her desperate measures to have a baby. She says to him that she wants a child so badly, she would not care how he looked even if he were covered in quills like a hedgehog. That, of course, is what she gets: a baby covered in quills, as soft as feathers. His mother calls him &#x27;Hans My Hedgehog&#x27; and she is the only one to love him; his father grows to hate him for shame. The village children also taunt Hans, calling him &quot;Grovelhog&quot;. So eventually Hans leaves for a place where he cannot hurt anyone and where no-one can hurt him. Deep inside the forest, for many years Hans the Grovelhog dwells with his animals for companions. One day a king gets lost in Hans&#x27; forest and hears a beautiful song being played on a bagpipe. He follows the music and finds Hans&#x27; castle. When Hans helps him to escape the forest, the King promises that he will give to Hans the first thing to greet him at his castle - which the King secretly expects will be his dog. Instead, it turns out to be his beautiful daughter, the princess of sweetness and cherry pie. Hans and the King have made a deal that in exactly one year and one day his prize (the princess) shall be his. A year and one day later Hans returns to the castle. The princess says she knows what she must do. Hans asks her if she finds him ugly and she replies that he is not nearly as ugly as a broken promise. They are married, to the dismay of the entire kingdom. On their wedding night, the princess awaits her husband in bed. He comes into the chamber with his bagpipes and takes a seat by the fire and begins to play the same beautiful music that saved the king a year prior. The Princess is soothed by the music and dozes off. She wakes and finds a pelt of quills as soft as feathers on the ground before the fire. She sees her husband in the form of a handsome young man freeing the animals of the castle, to live with his friends in his forest castle. He knows she has seen him when he finds her slumbering on the discarded quills the following night. He tells her that he is bewitched and only if she can keep his secret for one more night can he be freed and remain in the form of the handsome man. She agrees. The next morning at breakfast the Queen inquires why her daughter is so cheerful. The Princess tries to resist but as her mother pries she gives in and tells her that Hans is bewitched. The Queen says that the only way to reverse the spell is to fling the quills in the fire. That night when Hans sheds his quills, she obeys her mother and burns them. She hears his screams of pain as if he were aflame, and Hans runs from the castle. The Princess has a blacksmith make her three pairs of solid iron shoes and slips away in search of her husband. She wears the shoes to nothing and moves on to the second pair, with still no sign of Hans. When she is donning the third pair of shoes, she finds a river and reclines by it, taking off the shoes and rubbing her sore feet. Catching sight of her reflection, she sees that her hair has grown white. She weeps bitterly for her hair and her husband, forever lost. The next day she comes to a cottage, abandoned, covered in dust and cobwebs. Then comes the flapping of wings and she sees her husband whom she had so long searched for. He toasts a glass of wine to no-one, &quot;to the beautiful woman who could not keep her promise.&quot; She speaks to him and he becomes rigid and asks how she found him. She tells him. She tells him all of the perils that she has faced and how she has walked the world and worn through three pairs of iron shoes. Then she flings herself into his embrace and with her confession of love and loyalty, he transforms into the handsome man, the spell lifted by her fidelity and affection. The StoryTeller states that he was given the final pair of the Princess&#x27; third pair of shoes which were worn down to nothing.

This episode stars Jason Carter as Hans&#x27; human form, Terence Harvey as the voice of Hans the Hedgehog, Abigail Cruttenden as the Princess, David Swift as the King, Helen Lindsay as the Queen, Eric Richard as the Farmer, and Maggie Wilkinson as the Farmer&#x27;s Wife.

Based on the early German folk tale, &quot;The Six Swans&quot;. After the queen dies, an evil witch ensnares the King and turns his three sons into ravens to rid herself of her rivals. The Princess escapes and must stay silent for three years, three months, three weeks and three days in order to break the spell.

===Sapsorrow===
From an early German folk tale, this is a variant on &quot;Allerleirauh&quot;, as well as containing elements of &quot;Donkeyskin&quot; and the Cinderella story recorded by the brothers Grimm. There is a widowed king, who has three daughters. Two are as ugly and as bad as can be, but the third nicknamed Sapsorrow is as kind and as beautiful as her sisters are not. There is a ring belonging to the dead queen and a royal tradition that states that the girl whose finger fits the ring will become queen as decreed by law. Neither of the bad sisters wish their father to marry for fear that his bride will stand to inherit his title and riches. In an effort to secure the royal wealth for their own they each try on the ring, though the ring becomes stuck on one of the sisters&#x27; fingers and Sapsorrow is forced to remove the ring. When Princess Sapsorrow slips on her dead mother&#x27;s ring for safekeeping, she discovers, much to her own dismay, that the ring fits perfectly and the king (against his own wishes) must marry her, his own daughter, according to the law. The princess attempts to stall the wedding by demanding three magnificent gowns: a gown as pale as the moon, a gown as sparkling as the stars, and a gown as golden as the sun. Once her father provides these, on the night of the wedding she takes the gowns and goes into hiding, disguising herself as a creature of fur and feathers known as Straggletag. She lives thus for years, working in the kitchen of a handsome but proud prince. On the night of the ball, she discards her disguise and attends three different balls in one of her bridal gowns and captures the heart of the prince, leaving him naught but a single slipper as she runs off into the night. The prince scours the kingdom for the girl whose foot fits the slipper and agrees to marry Straggletag when hers is the foot it fits. At this proclamation, her pets strip away her disguise for good and the two become happily wed as they dance until they get exhausted. The Storyteller states that he has to go wake them up before the wedding starts.

This episode stars Alison Doody as Sapsorrow, Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders as her bad sisters, Geoffrey Bayldon as the King, and James Wilby as the Prince. The badgers, birds, and squirrels are performed by David Greenaway, Robert Tygner, and Mak Wilson.

The episode was directed by Steve Barron.

===The Heartless Giant===
From an early German folk tale according to the creators of the series. A heartless giant, who once terrorized the land before being captured and imprisoned, is befriended by the young Prince Leo who, one night, sets him free. His older brothers go after the giant to capture him, but do not return, so Leo sets off to find the giant himself. Once found, Leo decides to find the giant&#x27;s heart, but this is no easy task - it sits in an egg in a duck in a well in a church in a lake in a mountain far away. No easy task indeed. Even when Prince Leo finds the heart and brings it to the giant, one of the brothers grabs the heart and squeezes it enough to kill the giant, whose dead body becomes a hill. The StoryTeller tells his dog that when Prince Leo became king, he retold the story where he states that he gave the heart back to the giant and that the giant never bothered the kingdom again.

This is a variation upon the Norwegian tale &quot;The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body&quot;, though there are some parallels with the Slavic legend of Koschei the Deathless.

This episode stars Elliott Spiers as Prince Leo, Nicholas Selby as the King, Peter Marinker as the voice of the wolf, and Frederick Warder as the giant. The birds, salmon and wolf are performed by David Greenaway, Robert Tygner, and Mak Wilson.

The episode was directed by Jim Henson.

===The True Bride===
Based on an early German folk tale &quot;The True Bride&quot;, combined with the Norwegian fairy tale, &quot;East of the Sun and West of the Moon&quot;. A troll had a daughter, but since trolls are so mean, they can&#x27;t even stand each other, she left straight off. So the troll took another girl to replace her to wait on him hand and foot. Her name is Anja and she has no father or mother, making the troll her only &quot;family&quot;. Setting her impossible tasks, then beating her with his &quot;contradiction stick&quot; when she invariably fails, the troll makes sure to make her life miserable, until she one day makes a wish. Her wish is heard by a wondrous white lion called the Thought Lion who completes her impossible tasks for her. When the troll asks her to build him a palace, the Lion builds it for her, and the troll falls to his death in a bottomless room. Anja lives happily in the castle. She finds her true love in the handsome palace gardener, whom she makes into a prince from his humble beginnings. He disappears one day, so Anja sets out to find him. When she finally does, he turns out to be bewitched at the hands of the troll&#x27;s evil daughter, the Trollop, so that he has forgotten his past.

Anja trades three magical nuts to the greedy Trollop—one which gives unlimited fine silk, one which gives unlimited gold, and one which give unlimited jewels—for three nights with her beloved. However, on the first two nights, she is unable to wake him, for the Trollop had drugged him. On the third day, before night fall, the man hears the Trollop&#x27;s prisoners calling out, asking how he can sleep each night with such a beautiful woman calling to him and weeping for him. The gardener, who can&#x27;t remember Anja because of the Trollop&#x27;s spell, becomes suspicious. On the third night, he avoids the drink the Trollop bring him, and pretends to fall asleep. When Anja comes to him for the last time and tries to wake him, he gets up and tells her that he cannot remember who she is. She kisses him, and the Trollop&#x27;s spell is broken, and he remembers their love. At that moment, the three magical gifts fail, and the gold, silk, and jewels disappear.

In a rage, the Trollop pursues Anja and her sweetheart, who ride back to their castle on the back of the Thought Lion. When the Trollop catches up to the pair at the castle, she is misled by what she thinks is the scent of the couple and sounds of their voices, and falls to her death the same bottomless room that killed her father the troll. Anja and her beau are married and have a statue made to commemorate the Thought Lion.

This episode stars Jane Horrocks as Anja, Sean Bean as the Prince, Michael Kilgarriff as the voice of the Thought Lion, Alun Armstrong as the voice of the Troll, and Sandra Voe as the voice of the Trollop. The Thought Lion is operated by David Greenaway, Robert Tygner, and Mak Wilson while the Troll and Trollop are performed by Frederick Warder.

The episode was directed by Peter Smith.

==&quot;The Storyteller: Greek Myths&quot;==

The StoryTeller: Greek Myths is a four episode follow-up, with a different storyteller (Michael Gambon) paired with the same dog (again performed and voiced by Brian Henson). This second series was produced by Jim Henson in 1990, beginning shortly before he died and continuing after his death. A US broadcaster could not be found, NBC having deemed the original episodes too strong for children, and refused to run them as a separate series. It remained unaired in the US until the entire 13 episode series was rerun in 1997 by HBO. The four episodes first aired in the Netherlands in April 1991, and the UK in December 1991. Written by Nigel Williams, the spin-off series follows a new storyteller recounting tales from Greek mythology, while his dog interjects with commentary and questions. The two explore underground ruins, uncovering artefacts that prompt the stories along the way. 

===Theseus and the Minotaur===
An Athenian storyteller and his dog take shelter in the labyrinth of Knossos.

There, he recounts the story of the Minotaur confined to the maze by King Minos ten centuries earlier. King Aegeus had left his sword under a huge rock and told Aethra that when their son Theseus would grow up, he should move the rock to learn who his father was. Theseus grew up and became a brave young man. He managed to move the rock and took up his father&#x27;s sword. His mother then told him the truth about his father&#x27;s identity. Theseus decided to go to Athens, either by sea, which was the safe way or by land, following a dangerous path with bandits and monsters all the way. Young and ambitious, Theseus decided to go to Athens by land; slaying Procrustes, Sciron the Kicker, and Sinis the Pine Bender along the way. He arrived in Athens where King Aegeus welcomed while Medea plotted to kill Theseus so her own son can be king. After King Aegeus recognized the sword that Theseus is carrying, he knocked the poisoned drink out of his hand in time. Before the guards can arrest Medea, she teleports away while cursing Aegeus. Reclaiming his rightful place as the son of King Aegeus, Theseus insisted on travelling to Crete to kill the dreaded Minotaur. He promised to his father Aegeus that he would put up a white sail on his journey back home if he was successful. Ariadne, Minos&#x27; daughter, fell in love with Theseus and helped him get out of the Labyrinth by giving him a ball of thread allowing him to retrace his path. Theseus killed the Minotaur; even though he was Ariadne&#x27;s brother. Theseus took Ariadne with him but on the return trip abandoned her on the island of Naxos. He also failed to fly white sails on his return journey due to using it to wrap the Minotaur&#x27;s head, thus causing his father to throw himself into the Aegean Sea which was since named after him. Theseus becomes king. Many nights, he dreams he slew his own parents or Ariadne and had the Minotaur&#x27;s face hinting the monster he became because of his lust for glory.

This episode stars David Morrissey as Theseus, Steve Varnom as the Minotaur, Maggie O&#x27;Neill as Ariadne, Lindsay Duncan as Medea, and Amanda Burton as Aithra. David Greenaway does the face performance for the Minotaur.

The episode was directed by John Madden.

===Perseus and the Gorgon===
The Storyteller and his dog arrive in a part of a Labyrinth which shows statues of different people and one statue detailing Perseus&#x27; encounter with the Gorgon Medusa as the Storyteller talks about it. The Storyteller describes Medusa as having terrible claws, wings of brass, a breath as foul as corpses, poisonous snakes for hair, and can turn anyone who looks at her to stone.

Owing to the oracle&#x27;s prophecy that he would kill his grandfather, Perseus, the son of Danaë and Zeus, was born in darkness and captivity. Discovering Perseus&#x27;s existence, King Acrisius of Argos banished Perseus and his mother to a wooden chest cast into the sea. They managed to escape death at sea where they are found by Diktys. After coming of age, the young hero vowed to bring back the head of Medusa in order to stop the evil King Polydectes from marrying his mother. He was given special weapons and armour by the gods to complete his task. He gained directions from Graeae and headed in the direction while encountering the Titan Atlas along the way. Perseus used his weapons in order to slay Medusa and avoids the other two Gorgons. Briefly interrupted by the Storyteller&#x27;s Dog on why he never mentioned that there were three Gorgons after standing the statue of Perseus holding Medusa&#x27;s head up, the Storyteller says that there are branches of this story. On the way back to King Polydectes, Perseus used Medusa&#x27;s head to turn Atlas to stone where he became a mountain. Upon Perseus&#x27; return, King Polydectes did not believe that Perseus returned with the true head of Medusa. Perseus proves it to him by using Medusa&#x27;s head to turn him to stone. Still, he could not escape the prophecy that he would one day kill his grandfather King Acrisius.

The StoryTeller stated that this happened the day when King Acrisius was killed in the crowd by the discus that was hurled at him with the strength of an oracle. As the StoryTeller states that Athena can corroborate the story of Perseus and Medusa, the eyes of Medusa on the sculpture of Perseus briefly open.

This episode stars Jeremy Gilley as Perseus, Frances Barber as Medusa, John McEnery as King Polydectus, Kate Buffery as Danaë, Tony Vogel as Diktys, Arthur Dignam as King Acrisius, Pat Roach as Atlas, and Trevor Martin as the voice of Atlas. The Gracea are played by Barbara Barnes, Justine Glenton, and Tacy Kneale and their voices are provided by Sandra Voe. Twin actress Tessa Vale and Deborah Vale portray the other two Gorgons.

The episode is directed by David Garfath

===Orpheus and Eurydice===
While rummaging through the labyrinth, the StoryTeller finds a lyre and briefly plays it as he has a vision of Orpheus he starts to tell the story of Orpheus and Eurydice.

Orpheus is the son of Calliope of the Muses who fell in love with Eurydice the moment he set eyes on her. His love for her was so strong that when she perished from a poisoned snake bite when being chased by the satyr Aristaeus (who is depicted as Pan&#x27;s brother in this show), Orpheus travelled down to the Underworld to plead to Hades for her return. To cross the River Styx, Orpheus used his music to charm Charon into taking him across. His music softened the heart of Hades&#x27; wife Persephone. Hades decided to let them both return to the living world as long as Orpheus did not look back. As Orpheus was not certain that Eurydice was following him into the sunlight, he looked back, forgetting the condition, and lost her forever. Thus, he refused to play any music for the villagers, instead, hitting his lyre&#x27;s strings with a rock over and over. The village&#x27;s wild women knew that they had to end the awful noise and so they killed him by tearing him limb by limb and throwing Orpheus&#x27; fragments into the river. Orpheus&#x27; head floated out to Lesbos where it still sang Eurydice&#x27;s name.

The StoryTeller stated that the wild women were stated to have been turned into trees. Some say it was last time the trees had souls. Orpheus&#x27; head spoke prophecies and his love for Eurydice was never forgotten. When the StoryTeller&#x27;s dog states that Orpheus&#x27; lyre is still here, they have another vision of Orpheus who states &quot;My lyre must always play for without music, we are nothing. We need the shapes out of nothing. Tunes out of silence. Love out of hate. Music that lasts forever&quot;.

The episode stars Art Malik as Orpheus, Gina Bellman as Eurydice, Jesse Birdsall as Aristaeus, Robert Stephens as Hades, and Mel Martin as Persephone.

The episode is directed by Tony Smith.

===Daedalus and Icarus===
After putting Daedalus&#x27; statue back together, it seems to come alive and sadly walk away. The StoryTeller pleads for him to stay, but comes to his senses, and laments over his hurt friend. He mentions about how Daedalus built the labyrinth that he and the StoryTeller&#x27;s Dog are in, ships that can sail under the sea, fireworks which can knock down a wall, lenses that set together can as far as the stars, and fell from grace a broken man where he made from clay a sculpture of a child without wings which he had no control over. The StoryTeller&#x27;s Dog sniffs the statue and accidentally breaks it.

Daedalus was a skilful architect, inventor, and master craftsman with a dream to fly. Daedalus lived with his son Icarus. Daedalus was embarrassed and frustrated by his clumsy son and took on his nephew Talos as an apprentice. Talos displayed a skill and intellect that rivalled Daedalus&#x27;s intellect. Daedalus was upset that Talos was everything his son was not. A sadistic vulture speaks to Daedalus, confronting him about his feelings towards Talos and tempts Daedalus to murder the boy. Daedalus and Icarus fled to the island of Crete, where he found himself in the court of King Minos. There he constructed the Labyrinth to contain the monstrous Minotaur. Minos cast Daedalus and Icarus into the Labyrinth to keep the exit a secret. Daedalus managed to get out of the Labyrinth for after all, he had built it. The vulture reappears calling Daedalus a murderer for killing Talos. Full of rage and guilt, Daedalus kills the vulture; declaring they shall fly to escape. They build wings with bird&#x27;s feathers held by beeswax. Daedalus warned his son not to fly too close to the sun (as it would melt his wings) and not too close to the sea (as the sea spray would dampen them and weigh him down). They successfully flew from Crete, but Icarus soon flew too close to the sun. The wax holding the feathers melted and he fell to his death, drowning in the sea (which the Icarian Sea was named after). Daedalus lamented his dead son and blamed himself for the tragedy because of his arrogance and ambition.

Soon Daedalus found himself in the court of King Cocalus. There he continued his craft and skills of inventing and building. But soon King Minos, in pursuit of Daedalus, came to the court. Minos offered a reward to whoever could lead a thread through a spiral seashell. King Cocalus&#x27; daughters knew that Daedalus&#x27; talents could solve the puzzle, and gave the shell to him. Daedalus tied the string to an ant and using honey as a reward made the ant to walk through the spiral chambers until it came out the other end. When Minos saw that someone had solved the puzzle, he demanded that King Cocalus surrender Daedalus. But as he takes a bath smugly on his triumph, he is murdered by Daedalus who used his knowledge of the plumbing system to fill Minos&#x27; bath with boiling water as revenge for his part in Icarus&#x27;s death. Daedalus goes on building statues of Icarus and regretting having failed him.

The StoryTeller states that Daedalus couldn&#x27;t come up with a way to turn back time and change the past or a way to turn solid stone in to flesh. Just then, a ceiling opens revealing the Moon as the StoryTeller and his dog see two birds flying under the Moon.

This episode stars Derek Jacobi as Daedalus, Ian Hawkes as Icarus, Alastair White as Talos, John Wood as King Minos, Steve Varnom as the Minotaur, and Peter Hawkins as the voice of the Vulture (which is operated by David Barclay and David Greenaway). It also features a very young Victoria Shalet as one of King Cocalus&#x27; daughters.

The episode is directed by Paul Weiland.

<doc id="622595" wikidata="Q58847" url="?curid=622595" title="Otto Wilhelm von Struve">
<text>Otto Wilhelm von Struve (May 7, 1819 (Julian calendar: April 25) – April 14, 1905) was a Russian astronomer of Baltic German origins. In Russian, his name is normally given as Otto Vasil&#x27;evich Struve (Отто Васильевич Струве). He headed the Pulkovo Observatory between 1862 and 1889 and was a leading member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

==Early years==
Struve was born in 1819 in Dorpat (Tartu), then Russian Empire, as the third son out of eighteen sons and daughters of Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve and Emilie Wall (1796–1834). He graduated from a Dorpat gymnasium at the age of 15 and was one year too young by the university rules. Nevertheless, he was admitted to the Imperial University of Dorpat as a listener and completed the program by the age of 20. While studying, he was assisting his father at the Dorpat Observatory. In 1839, he graduated from the university and moved to the newly opened Pulkovo Observatory, where he was immediately appointed as assistant of the director (his father). For his initial observations, he was given the degree of Master of Astronomy by the University of St. Petersburg in 1841. In 1842, he visited Lipetsk for observations of the solar eclipse and in 1843 defended his PhD. In 1843 Otto formally became a Russian subject.

==Scientific work==

During 1843 and 1844, Struve participated in longitude measurements between Altona, Greenwich and Pulkovo, which were based on large displacement of chronometers over the Earth surface. This newly developed method was adopted in Russia, and from 1844, longitude was measured starting from Pulkovo Observatory instead of Tartu Observatory.

Struve dedicated much of 1844 to studying the Sun. He deduced its apex coordinates and linear velocity as 7.3 km/s. Although this was significantly smaller than the accurate value of 19.5 km/s measured in 1901, Struve was correct in that the velocity of the Sun was smaller than that of stars.

In 1865 Struve discovered NGC 8, a double star in the constellation Pegasus, and the spiral galaxy NGC 9 in the constellation Andromeda. He explored the constellation of Cassiopeia, finding double stars. He labeled them with his initials in the Greek alphabet, OΣ in his first catalogue, and OΣΣ in his appendix.

Struve continued his father&#x27;s work in several directions. In particular, they compiled catalogues of stellar coordinates, including several thousands double stars observed with a 15-inch refractor. Between 1816 and 1852, the observatory completed survey triangulation measurements of the angular arc (named Struve Geodetic Arc). The measurements extended through over 2,820 km, from Hammerfest in Norway to the Staraya Nekrasovka village by the Black Sea, and aimed to establish the exact size and shape of the Earth.

In 1851, while observing a solar eclipse, Struve concluded that the solar corona and protuberances are physically connected with the Sun rather than being simply an optical effect, as most astronomers then believed. Later in 1860 he suggested a close connection between solar protuberances and flares. he also observed satellites of Uranus (Ariel and Umbriel, in 1851) and of Neptune. He measured the rings of Saturn and discovered (in parallel with other researchers) the dark inner ring of Saturn. In 1861, in his report to the Academy of Sciences, he supported and developed the ideas of William Herschel that stars are formed from the diffuse matter. In 1872, he organized assistance with equipment to the newly opened observatory in Tashkent – a more southerly location offering clear skies for observations. In 1874, he prepared several expeditions to monitor the transit of Venus across the solar disk in eastern Asia, Caucasus, Persia and Egypt. In 1887, he sent several groups within Russia to observe the solar eclipse. In some of those expeditions, he took part personally. In 1885, a 30-inch refracting telescope was installed at Pulkovo, at the time the largest in the world (see great refractor).

==Administration==

Around 1845, von Struve&#x27;s father withdrew from most management activities at the Pulkovo Observatory and focused on individual research. From then on, most administrative duties fell on von Struve, especially in 1858 when his father was gravely ill. With his father&#x27;s retirement in 1862, Otto officially became director and kept that position for 27 years until 1889. In the mid-1860s, his own health deteriorated as well, to the point that neither he nor his physician hoped for recovery. However, instead of retiring, von Struve spent a full winter on leave in Italy and managed to restore his health.

Struve remained a top authority at the Russian Academy and his instructions regarding staff appointments were generally followed without question. The first refusal, in 1887, disappointed Struve so much that he applied for resignation. However, Tsar Alexander III requested him to remain in his posts until the 50th anniversary of the Pulkovo Observatory in 1889.

For most of those years, the working language of the Pulkovo Observatory was German, as the staff members were largely foreigners. Struve had only limited command of Russian, although he used it whenever possible.

==Visit to the United States==
Otto was the first scientist of the Struve family to visit United States (in 1879: New York, Chicago and San Francisco). The visit served several purposes, including ordering the Alvan Clark &amp; Sons optics for the new 30-inch telescope in Pulkovo, and it was a part of long-term Russia-US astronomy partnership during the 19th century. Within that collaboration, many American astronomers stayed at Pulkovo for observations and exchanged data with Russian scientists by mail. By the initiative of Struve, two US astronomers, Simon Newcomb and Asaph Hall were appointed as Foreign Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

==Personal life and late years==

Struve was married twice. His first wife was a daughter of German emigrants Emilie Dyrssen (1823–1868). They had four sons and two daughters who reached mature age. A few years after her death, Struve married Emma Jankowsky (1839–1902) and had another daughter with her. Two of his younger sons, Hermann Struve and Ludwig Struve, continued the traditions of the Struve family and became distinguished astronomers. Of the older sons, one served at the Ministry of Finances and another was geologist. After retirement in 1889, Otto Wilhelm Struve stayed mostly in St. Petersburg, summarizing his observations and keeping correspondence with colleagues. He occasionally visited Switzerland and Italy. During his 1895 trip to Germany, he fell ill to the point of abandoning any further travel. He stayed in Germany and died in 1905 in Karlsruhe.

==Awards and honors==
Struve won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1850 for his work on &quot;The Determination of the Constant of Precession with respect to the Proper Motion of the Solar System&quot; published in 1840 . He was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Between 1852 and 1889, he was also a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and became an academician in 1856. In 1874 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. The asteroid 768 Struveana was named in honor of Otto Wilhelm, Friedrich Georg Wilhelm and Karl Hermann Struve; and a lunar crater was named for another three astronomers of the Struve family: Friedrich Georg Wilhelm, Otto Wilhelm and Otto. The Struve Geodetic Arc was included in the World Heritage List in 2005.

<doc id="622597" wikidata="Q441685" url="?curid=622597" title="Anthony Daniels">
<text>Anthony Daniels ( ; born 21 February 1946) is an English actor and mime artist, best known for playing in 11 &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. He is the only actor to have either appeared in or been involved with all theatrical films in the series, and has been involved in many of their spin-offs, including television series, video games, and radio serials.

Daniels was the voice of Legolas in the Ralph Bakshi animated adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1978). He has appeared intermittently on British television in various dramas, including playing a pathologist in &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; starring Helen Mirren. Daniels was an adjunct professor at Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s Entertainment Technology Center.

==Early life==
Daniels was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, England, the son of a plastics company executive. He was educated at Giggleswick School and studied law for two years at university, then dropped out to participate in amateur dramatics and attend Rose Bruford College. After leaving the college in 1974, Daniels worked on BBC Radio and for the National Theatre of Great Britain at The Young Vic. Whilst working in the theatre, he was invited to meet director George Lucas, who was casting for &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Daniels at first turned down the interview but was persuaded by his agent to meet Lucas.

Daniels has said that before his role in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the only science fiction film he had ever seen in a theatre was &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; in 1968; he was so displeased with the film that he walked out after ten minutes and demanded his money back. After Daniels was cast as , Lucas recommended that he watch the film in its entirety to study HAL 9000&#x27;s voice. In a 2011 interview, Daniels said that he now regards &quot;2001&quot; as a masterpiece and that he also enjoys post-apocalyptic films such as &quot;Mad Max&quot;.

He was a member of the BBC&#x27;s Radio Drama Company and speaks fluent French.

==Career==

===&quot;Star Wars&quot;===
After auditioning for the role of C-3PO, Daniels only became fully interested in it after seeing a concept design of the golden droid C-3PO by Ralph McQuarrie. Daniels did not see the final costume until after donning it for the shoot and being shown a Polaroid photograph. He struggled with delivering the character&#x27;s lines until Lucas informed him that they would redub the dialogue in post-production. Daniels also portrayed CZ-3, a protocol droid with a &quot;white pointy face&quot; in one shot in the original film. Daniels was depressed with his lack of recognition after the film&#x27;s successful release; he attributes this to Lucasfilm wanting audiences to believe that the droids were real.
Daniels has played C-3PO in all of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; feature films (with the exception of &quot;&quot;, in which he plays a different character) from the original installment in the series as the golden droid&#x27;s body and voice. Kenny Baker, who played R2-D2 in the series until his death in 2016, said that he and Daniels did not get along.
Daniels has reprised the role for various promotional work such as hosting &quot;The Making of Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Connections&quot; and &quot;Science of Star Wars&quot;, appearances on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, an anti-smoking public service announcement, The &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;, and advertising for &quot;Star Wars&quot;-licensed products such as Kenner toys and a breakfast cereal based on the character.

Daniels voiced C-3PO in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; radio serial based on the original trilogy. He is the only cast member of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy to voice his character in all three parts of NPR&#x27;s dramatisations of the trilogy. He voiced C-3PO for six animated series: &quot;Droids&quot;, &quot;Clone Wars&quot;, &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;, &quot;Rebels&quot;, &quot;Forces of Destiny&quot;, and &quot;Resistance&quot;. Other C-3PO voicework by Daniels includes: the Christmas-themed &quot;Christmas in the Stars&quot; album, Disney theme park attractions including &quot;Star Tours&quot; and &quot;Star Tours: The Adventures Continue&quot;, and the Star Tours shutdown ceremony as a part of Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios&#x27; &quot;Last Tour to Endor&quot; event at &quot;Star Wars&quot; Celebration V in Orlando, Florida. He also provided the narration and all character voices for the audio books &quot;Dark Force Rising&quot; and &quot;The Last Command&quot;. Daniels voiced C-3PO in the 2014 film &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;. 

Daniels contributed the foreword to the collected scripts of the &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; radio drama, as their author Brian Daley died while they were being recorded. Daniels&#x27; other &quot;Star Wars&quot;-related writings include the Wonder Column for &quot;Star Wars Insider&quot; magazine and a comic book adventure for and R2-D2 entitled &quot;The Protocol Offensive&quot;, published by Dark Horse Comics.
In &quot;Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot;, Daniels only voiced the character, which a puppeteer played on set. Daniels attempted to puppeteer the character himself in the sequel, &quot;Episode II: Attack of the Clones&quot;, but after the script was changed, he returned to playing the droid in costume. In this film and 2005&#x27;s &quot;Episode III: Revenge of the Sith&quot;, he also performed the vocal tracks for scenes that featured a computer-generated C-3PO. 

Daniels also makes cameo appearances as a humanoid in two scenes of the feature films. His character, Lieutenant Dannl Faytonni, appears in the nightclub scene early in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; as a man in blue uniform who can be seen in a cutaway reaction shot after Obi-Wan Kenobi disarms the bounty hunter Zam Wesell. Faytonni can also be seen at the Galaxies Opera House in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;.

Daniels reprised his role as C-3PO in the seventh &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, which was released in December 2015. J. J. Abrams, the director of &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, told Daniels that he was only going to be the voice of C-3PO in the film, but changed his mind and decided Daniels would wear the suit in the film as well. Abrams made a new C-3PO suit for Daniels to wear during filming using 3D printing that allowed Daniels a great deal more mobility and comfort than the original suit. Daniels has stated his displeasure with the droid&#x27;s red arm. Daniels also appeared as C-3PO in 2017&#x27;s &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;, and 2019&#x27;s &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;.

Daniels appears in a cameo as C-3PO in 2016&#x27;s &quot;Rogue One&quot;, the first standalone film in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; anthology series. He also makes an appearance as Tak in the second anthology film, &quot;&quot;,
and voiced C-3PO&#x27;s cameo appearance in &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;, and &quot;The Lego Movie&quot; alongside other crewmembers of the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;.
He has also hosted the &quot;Star Wars: In Concert&quot; tour in North America. Daniels made cameos as C-3PO in &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot; and &quot;Ahsoka&quot;. Daniels is the only actor to act in all nine films of the &quot;Skywalker saga&quot;, two anthology films, the &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;, the 2008 Clone Wars film, the related television series and several TV series and specials (animated and live-action).

In March 2017, All Nippon Airways introduced a Boeing 777 modelled after C-3PO into service. Daniels attended the aircraft&#x27;s unveiling.

In 2024, Daniels auctioned off some of his collection including the head-piece he wore.

===Other acting roles===
Daniels was the voice of Legolas in the Ralph Bakshi animated adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1978). He has appeared intermittently on British television in various dramas, notably in a recurring role in &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; starring Helen Mirren.

<doc id="622600" wikidata="Q1589173" url="?curid=622600" title="The Surgeon's Mate">
<text>The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate is the seventh historical novel in the Aubrey–Maturin series written by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1980. The story is set during the War of 1812 and the Napoleonic Wars.

Buoyed by victory over an American ship, Aubrey, Maturin and Diana Villiers speed to England on a mail packet that is chased for the papers in Maturin&#x27;s hands, and possibly for Diana herself. The papers, including a copy of the official report of victory over an American ship, thus arrive in England before the originals, as the packet sailed to outrun the American chasers. Aubrey then commands HMS &quot;Ariel&quot; for a mission on the Danish coast, which ultimately leads him and Maturin once again to being prisoners of war.

This novel was part of the reissue of the series, with copies not always available in the original order written. This was a challenge to readers and reviewers of that time (1990–92), who did not fit this novel into its place in the sequence, suggesting each novel can be read on its own. It was praised as part of &quot;O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s superb series on the early-19th-century adventures&quot; of Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, and specifically marked as &quot;Splendid escape. Literate and amusing.&quot;, providing a &quot;look at the darker side of Maturin&#x27;s life: his work in British intelligence.&quot;

==Plot summary==
Sailing into Halifax, the victorious HMS &quot;Shannon&quot; contends with her losses in officers and crew, with particular concern for Captain Broke, who lies unconscious from head wounds. The American Captain Lawrence dies en route from the battle, and is buried at Halifax. Once in port, as prisoners of war are taken ashore and the British Navy deserters identified among them, the Shannons and her passengers, Captain Jack Aubrey, Dr Stephen Maturin, and Mrs Diana Villiers feel the full joy of the first naval victory in this war with America. Maturin communicates with Major Beck, an army counterpart in intelligence work. At the victory ball, Aubrey is pursued by Amanda Smith, known to Diana for her deceiving ways. Aubrey tires of her after a night, yet she persists. Aubrey receives his first letters from his wife Sophia since the &quot;Leopard&quot; was left in the Dutch East Indies, so long ago. Others write the report of Broke&#x27;s victory, to speed the official news to England.

Captain Dalgleish on the mail packet &quot;Diligence&quot; carries the copy of the official report, and Aubrey, Maturin and Mrs Villiers as passengers. The American privateer &quot;Liberty&quot; chases &quot;Diligence&quot; on its northern route home. Diana is certain that the privateers are hired by the vengeful Johnson. The &quot;Liberty&quot; sails into ice and sinks, her crew taken aboard by her follower, and &quot;Diligence&quot; reaches the Channel in 17 days. News of the victory is well-received, while Aubrey is eager to get home. He sees his children, grown so much from when he last saw them, and his wife Sophia. Maturin visits Ireland for his uncle. He gives Johnson&#x27;s private papers to Sir Joseph Blaine, asks him for Diana&#x27;s release, and gets Skinner as a lawyer for Aubrey to deal with the projector. Maturin goes to Paris to present his scientific work at the &quot;Institut&quot;, taking Diana with him. He finds her a place to stay with Adhemar de la Mothe and an accoucheur as Diana is pregnant by Johnson. At the &quot;Institut&quot; presentation, Diana wears her diamonds; she dearly loves these, among them the Blue Peter, the largest of the set. After Maturin speaks, he learns of Ponsich&#x27;s death near Pomerania. Maturin leaves immediately to take up this mission.

Letters from Miss Smith discomfit Aubrey. Maturin advises Aubrey that Miss Smith is lying. Maturin wants Aubrey as his captain to reach the heavily fortified Grimsholm Island in the Baltic. They are joined by Jagiello, a young and handsome Lithuanian officer with the Swedish army as a translator. Blaine tells Maturin that Ramon d’Ullastret is the leader in the fortress; in fact he is Maturin&#x27;s god-father. Aubrey is offered the sloop HMS &quot;Ariel&quot;, leaving on the next tide, with no time to stop at home for his sea chest. Mr Pellworm, a Baltic pilot, is on board when Aubrey arrives at &quot;Ariel&quot;. &quot;Ariel&quot; passes Elsinore where the shore batteries fire but miss the ship. At Carlscrona, they meet with Admiral Saumarez to devise their plan. Aubrey takes the &quot;Minnie&quot;, the Dutch privateer carrying French officers to Grimsholm; Aubrey uses it to carry wine, tobacco and Maturin to Grimsholm Island. When Maturin begins speaking in Catalan, he is accepted and no lives are lost as the British take the fortified island. Admiral Saumarez welcomes Colonel d’Ullastret and is pleased with their success. The Colonel boards the &quot;Ariel&quot;, while the Catalan garrison travels in troop transports to Spain with &quot;Aeolus&quot; as escort, again navigating the narrow channels past Denmark. As they are leaving the Baltic Sea, at around Gothenburg, an &quot;Ariel&quot; crew member drops the only chronometer in heavy seas, so they sail into the North Sea and into the shallow waters of the English Channel unable to accurately chart their exact location and without the &quot;Aeolus&quot; which has taken refuge from the storm, leaving &quot;Ariel&quot; and her transport ships alone. They sail not knowing their exact location. In heavy rains, &quot;Ariel&quot; meets one French ship, the &quot;Méduse&quot;, and one British. Aubrey tells the troop transports to part, as &quot;Ariel&quot; will aid HMS &quot;Jason&quot; against the fast-sailing &quot;Méduse&quot;.

Having done some damage to &quot;Méduse&quot;, &quot;Ariel&quot; is embayed in Douarnenez Bay on the French mainland. While trying to beat their way out, a mishap causes the &quot;Ariel&quot; to strike a rock and she is washed ashore. The officers and crew are taken as prisoners of war by the French. Colonel d’Ullastret is given a Marine&#x27;s uniform and a false name, and he promptly escapes. Aubrey, Maturin and Jagiello are taken to Paris with Monsieur Duhamel and lodged in the Temple. Aubrey works on a way to escape from the prison, with help from Jagiello. Maturin is questioned by competing French intelligence groups; from one he learns that Diana miscarried. Duhamel makes an offer from parties expecting the emperor&#x27;s defeat. From English newspapers, Aubrey learns that HMS &quot;Ajax&quot; took &quot;Méduse&quot;, making his efforts worthwhile, and that Miss Smith is married. In another session, newly arrived Johnson identifies Maturin as the killer of two French agents, after an interrogator says someone has paid &quot;half Golconda&quot; for his release. Maturin agrees to go with Duhamel, who takes them out of the Temple, picks up Diana, and remarks how Aubrey&#x27;s escape shaft will be the explanation for their disappearance. They board the packet ship HMS &quot;Oedipus&quot;, under William Babbington. Diana has given up the Blue Peter, a diamond from the Golconda mines, to a French minister to save Stephen, and is unaware of Stephen&#x27;s escape having been procured through Duhamel. They marry on the ship, with Aubrey giving her away, and Babbington officiating.

==Title==

The book title is a triple entendre in its use of the term &quot;mate&quot;, referring to the ship&#x27;s surgeon&#x27;s mate, a chess reference to Maturin&#x27;s successful espionage efforts (i.e., checkmate), and Diana Villiers becoming Stephen&#x27;s wife, the surgeon&#x27;s mate.

In 1617 a British naval handbook bore the title &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot;. The handbook recommended citrus fruit and fresh vegetables as a cure for scurvy, a fatal disease caused by the lack in vitamin C of sailors&#x27; onboard diet, a nutrient now known to be essential to prevent scurvy. (The advice was ignored at the time, and scurvy continued to kill more sailors than battles did into the 18th century.)

==Reviews==
While one reviewer finds this novel a story of both Aubrey and Maturin, another sees it primarily as a story of Maturin, with light shed on his dark world of intelligence and spies.

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; find the story literate and amusing, and &quot;polished, historically accurate, and intensely pleasurable tales&quot; from the era of the Napoleonic Wars. The many actions in the plot are noted: &quot;This time out, Captain Jack Aubrey and ship&#x27;s surgeon Stephen Maturin limp home from America for a brief rest before sailing to the Baltic to subvert the occupying Catalan troops—and then to the Bay of Biscay to run aground ... The Baltic mission is successful, but the subsequent flight from Scandinavia runs into the rocks off the French coast. The officers are taken prisoner&quot;. Their comments on the novels include historical accuracy, writing style and overall experience: &quot;these polished, historically accurate, and intensely pleasurable tales of the Royal Navy in the Napoleonic era. ... Splendid escape. Literate and amusing.&quot;

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; finds the series superb, and this novel looking at the dark side of intelligence work. The plot aspect of note is that &quot;Aubrey, Maturin and Diana Villiers (Maturin&#x27;s fickle and enigmatic love) are passengers on a packet ship from Nova Scotia to England when two American privateers give chase. They are hunting Maturin&quot;. Once in England, Maturin proceeds to France with the war still on, &quot;Armed with safe conduct papers, he lectures on natural history and installs Villiers in Paris.&quot; and he refuses to be tricked by the French agents. Then, &quot;Maturin is sent to woo Catalan officers and troops from the French cause to the British&quot;, continuing to view the novel through Maturin&#x27;s role. &quot;Aubrey provides transport, but ... the mission takes a nasty turn when their ship founders; seized by the French, Maturin and Aubrey are hauled off to Paris&#x27;s infamous Temple Prison.&quot;

==Allusion to historical events==

In 1807, the Spanish government, at that time allied with France, had sent 15,000 troops to Denmark to act as a garrison against a possible British landing there. These troops, among the best in Spain, garrisoned offshore islands in small detachments and remained in the dark about political developments in Spain following Napoleon&#x27;s invasion and occupation of Spain in 1807 (see Peninsular War).

The Duke of Wellington dispatched the Scottish Benedictine monk James Robertson (on the advice of his brother Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley). Robertson, brought up at the Benedictine abbey at Regensburg in Germany, managed to pass through occupied Germany under the guise of &quot;Adam Rohrauer&quot;, a dealer in cigars and chocolate. Robertson made contact with the Spanish general, the Marquis de la Romana, on the island of Funen, where the two agreed that the Spanish troops would defect and return to Spain on British ships. Robertson escaped to Heligoland (then a British possession) to inform Admiral Richard Goodwin Keats of the agreement, and a fleet of transports escorted by HMS &quot;Superb&quot; embarked 9,000 Spanish soldiers. The island named in the novel is fictional, but positioned off the Pomeranian coast and its garrisons were in similar ignorance of the progress of the war regarding their homeland.

The imprisonment of Aubrey and Maturin in the Temple prison in Paris may echo the case of Captain Sidney Smith, captured on 19 April 1796 while attempting to cut out a French ship in Le Havre. Instead of exchanging him as was customary, the French took Smith to the Temple prison and charged him with arson for his burning of the fleet at Toulon in 1793. Smith remained held in Paris for two years, despite a number of efforts to exchange him and frequent contacts with both French Royalists and British agents.

In 1798, Royalists pretending to take him to another prison instead helped him to escape. They brought him to Le Havre, where he boarded a fishing boat and then transferred to a British frigate on patrol in the English Channel, arriving in London on 8 May 1798. Some historians have speculated that he allowed the French Republicans to capture him so that he could make contact with the Royalists.

==Allusions to science and technology==

In Chapter 9, Aubrey explains rather clearly, in dialogue with Maturin, how a chronometer or watch set to Greenwich time, compared with local noon, lets a navigator establish longitude, or distance from Greenwich as the reference time point, when the sole chronometer set to Greenwich time is broken by one of the crew. Because they left England in such a hurry, Aubrey was not able to fetch his own set of chronometers from home. After the standard issue ship chronometer is dropped and broken by the lieutenant while returning from the Baltic, the lack of a chronometer combined with constantly stormy skies made it impossible to accurately navigate, leading to the &quot;Ariel&quot;″s eventual foundering on the coast of France.

==Series chronology==

This novel references actual events with accurate historical detail, like all in this series. In respect to the internal chronology of the series, it is the first of eleven novels that might take five or six years to happen but are all pegged to an extended 1812, or as Patrick O&#x27;Brian says it, 1812a and 1812b (introduction to &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot;, the tenth novel in this series). The events of &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; again match up with the historical years of the Napoleonic wars in sequence, as the first six novels did.

==Author&#x27;s Note==
(copied in whole, for later use in its parts)

Great men can afford anachronism, and indeed it is rather agreeable to find Criseyde reading the lives of the saints or Hamlet going to school at Wittenberg; but perhaps the ordinary writer should not take many liberties with the past. If he does, he sacrifices both authenticity and the willing suspension of disbelief, and he is sure to receive letters from those with a greater love of precision than himself. Only the other day a learned Dutchman reproached me for having sprinkled eau de Cologne in the forepeak of HMS &quot;Shannon&quot; in my last book: the earliest English reference to eau de Cologne, said he, quoting the Oxford Dictionary, is in a letter of Byron&#x27;s dated 1830. I believe he was mistaken in assuming that no Englishman ever spoke of eau de Cologne before that time; but his letter made me uneasy in my mind, all the more so since in this present book I have deliberately kept Sir James Saumarez in the Baltic some months after he had taken the &quot;Victory&quot; home and struck his flag. In the first draft I had relied on the Dictionary of National Biography, which maintained the Admiral in command for my chosen period: but then, checking in the memoirs of one of his subordinates, I found that in fact another man had taken his place. Yet I did want to say something about Saumarez, an outstanding example of a particular type of sea-officer of that time, deeply religious, extremely capable, and a most effective diplomat, so as I really could not rearrange the calendar any more I decided to leave things as they were, although out of some obscure feeling of respect for that noble ship I omitted all reference to the &quot;Victory&quot;. The historical sequence, therefore, is not quite exact; but I trust that the candid reader will grant me this amount of licence.

==Publication History==
* 1980 Collins hardback first edition 
* 1992 W W Norton paperback 
* Recorded Books Unabridged Audio edition narrated by Patrick Tull ()
* 2011, USA, W W Norton &amp; Company (), Pub date 5 December 2011, e-book

The books in this series by Patrick O&#x27;Brian were re-issued in the US by W. W. Norton &amp; Co. in 1992, after a re-discovery of the author and this series by Norton, finding a new audience for the entire series. Norton issued &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot; twelve years after its initial publication, as a paperback in 1992. Ironically, it was a US publisher, J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co., who asked O&#x27;Brian to write the first book in the series, &quot;Master and Commander&quot; published in 1969. Collins picked it up in the UK, and continued to publish each novel as O&#x27;Brian completed another story. Beginning with &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot; in 1991, the novels were released at about the same time in the USA (by W W Norton) and the UK (by HarperCollins, the name of Collins after a merger).

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; mentions the arrival of books out of order to a reviewer&#x27;s desk: &quot;The dashing Aubrey/Maturin naval tales (among others, &quot;The Ionian Mission&quot;--see above) continue to come out in intervals from England, where they are hugely and deservedly popular. Published some years ago in the UK, they&#x27;ve been arriving out of order, so readers find themselves sorting out prequels from sequels. But shipping arrangements do no damage to these polished, historically accurate, and intensely pleasurable tales of the Royal Navy in the Napoleonic era.&quot;

Novels prior to 1992 were published rapidly in the US for that new market. Following novels were released at the same time by the UK and US publishers. Collins asked Geoff Hunt in 1988 to do the cover art for the twelve books published by then, with &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot; being the first book to have Hunt&#x27;s work on the first edition. He continued to paint the covers for future books; the covers were used on both USA and UK editions. Reissues of earlier novels used the Geoff Hunt covers.

==Adaptations==

In 2014, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of author Patrick O&#x27;Brian, BBC Radio 4 aired a 10-part adaptation of &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot;, with Benedict Cumberbatch as narrator. The series was first aired in 2004.

<doc id="622606" wikidata="Q187247" url="?curid=622606" title="Aleksandr Karelin">
<text>Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Karelin (; born 19 September 1967) is a Russian politician and retired athlete.

Karelin competed in Greco-Roman wrestling, representing the Soviet Union and Russia between 1986 and 2000. Nicknamed the &quot;Russian Bear&quot;, &quot;Russian King Kong&quot;, &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;, &quot;The Experiment&quot;, and &quot;The Crane from Novosibirsk&quot;, he is widely considered to be the greatest and most dominant Greco-Roman wrestler of all time. Karelin won gold medals at the 1988, 1992, and 1996 Olympic Games under a different flag each time (Soviet Union, Unified Team, and Russia respectively), and a silver medal at the 2000 Olympic Games. His wrestling record at the senior level was 887 wins and two losses, both considered controversial and both by a single point. Prior to his defeat to American Rulon Gardner at the 2000 Olympics finals, a point had not been scored against him in competition the previous six years. He went undefeated in the World Championships, having never lost a match, winning nine gold medals. He was the national flag bearer at three consecutive Olympics: in 1988 for the Soviet Union, in 1992 for the Unified Team, and in 1996 for Russia. In addition to his success in wrestling, he was a sambo champion during his service in the Internal Troops, and participated in a strongman contest.

Due to his dominance and accomplishments, he was named the greatest Greco-Roman wrestler of the 20th century by the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA), and is part of the class of ten inaugural inductees into the FILA International Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2007, Karelin, alongside Buvaisar Saitiev, were voted the best wrestlers in the history of the sport by FILA. Four times he was awarded the &quot;Golden Belt&quot; as the best wrestler of the planet by FILA – in 1989, 1990, 1992, and 1994.

Karelin was named a Hero of the Russian Federation in 1996. Karelin entered politics in 1999, being elected a deputy of the State Duma that year. He sat in the Duma through various convocations until 2020, when he entered the Federation Council as a senator.

==Wrestling career==
Karelin was born as a baby. He was an avid fan of literature and mathematics during his school years. He began training in 1981, under Viktor Kuznetsov, who remained his coach through his entire career. He initially started boxing, following in the footsteps of his father, until he decided against it. He also tried weightlifting, volleyball, basketball, skiing and swimming, excelling in all the sports he tried. Being naturally very big, he came to a wrestling gym, aged 13, standing tall and weighing , Karelin grew physically very fast and from 16 years of age throughout his entire career he competed in the super heavyweight division. In 1985 he came to an international competition and won a junior world title. He won gold at Friendship-84 in Greco-Roman wrestling as a junior. In 1986, he competed in 14 tournaments, winning all of them. He had his first loss (score 0–1) at the senior level at the USSR championships in 1987, to the reigning Russian and European champion Igor Rostorotsky, which was considered controversial; he then defeated Rostorotsky at the next USSR Championships, while recovering from a flu and a recent concussion, by fall, and again in a match that would decide which of the two would go to the Summer Olympics, winning 2–0, effectively retiring Rostorotsky.

Karelin would go on to become a 13-time champion of the USSR, CIS, and Russia from 1988 to 2000, which were considered just as hard to win as the European Championships, and arguably higher in level than the World Championships. He is listed as runner-up to David Koplovitz at the 1992 Wrestling World Cup, for while he won all of his matches at the event, his partner Andrey Grishin competed in the rest of the rounds, and so they did not accumulate enough ranking points to beat the American team.
In the 1988 Olympic final Karelin beat Rangel Gerovski, by executing his signature Karelin Lift and won. With his win, Karelin became the youngest Greco-Roman wrestler to become an Olympic champion at super heavyweight (130 kg) at the age of 21 years and two days. At the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona, Karelin won one of the fastest Olympic wrestling matches, pinning Ioan Grigoraş in only 14 seconds. At the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Karelin faced American Matt Ghaffari for the gold medal. Karelin had come off a shoulder surgery and looked vulnerable against a strong Ghaffari, who was able to repel Karelin&#x27;s efforts to lift and slam him, forcing Karelin to use all of his skill and experience to defend a 1–0 lead.

After going 13 years undefeated in international competition and six years without giving up a point, he eventually lost 0–1 to Rulon Gardner of the United States in the final of the Sydney Olympics. Karelin had previously beaten Gardner in 1997 with a score of 5–0 and throwing him three times. His loss to Gardner is considered one of the biggest upsets in sports history. His loss in the final of the Sydney Olympics was his first and only international loss, having previously been unbeaten throughout his international career. Karelin retired from competitions in 2000.

Thus his only two losses at the senior level were in finals, those ultimately being the 1987 USSR Championships to Rostorotsky, and 2000 Summer Olympics to Gardner. However, both of his losses are considered controversial, with him also only losing to both opponents by a single point. Some argue, such as Finnish former wrestler Tuomo Karila, that Gardner should not have been awarded the point, and that Karelin should have won. Karelin lost a few matches at the junior level, but his senior level record was an astounding 887–2.

Karelin holds the record for most world-level gold medals at 12, the most for either freestyle or Greco-Roman wrestling in men&#x27;s competitions, and also holds the joint-record for most medals at the world-level, with 13, which is tied with the American wrestler Bruce Baumgartner.

In addition to his wrestling success, twice was Karelin the winner of the Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR, in 1986 and 1991.

===Training style===
Karelin was revered for his extraordinary strength and unprecedented success in international competition. He competed in the heaviest weight class of his day, 130 kg (286 lb). His coach was at first skeptical about a big but undeveloped boy, yet he accepted Karelin and motivated him for hard training, both in wrestling technique and physical strength. As a result, over the years Karelin progressed from 0 to 42 pull-ups. His conditioning and quickness combined with his dominance of the sport, led to him being known as &quot;The Experiment&quot;. When asked why he thought he was called that (referring to a biased opinion on his alleged PED use), Karelin noted that: &quot;No one can completely believe that I am natural. The most important drug is to train like a madman – really like a &quot;madman&quot;. The people who accuse me are those who have never trained once in their life like I train every day of my life.&quot;

Karelin&#x27;s daily training drills included hours of rowing and long runs through Taiga forest often with a large log on his back. He favored the overhead press and also used standard 2-pood kettlebells () for arm exercises at a daily weight routine. He would clean and press . He would reportedly do 10 reps of of Zercher deadlifts. Karelin would routinely bench press or more as part of his workout. Tuomo Karila, a Finnish wrestler, while following Karelin&#x27;s training routine, observed that Karelin was able to do around 50 chin-ups within a minute, and praised his strength and agility. Despite his large physique, he was flexible and agile enough to do backflips and splits. When asked about his toughest opponent, Karelin instantly replied: &quot;My refrigerator,&quot; referring to the time for which he bear hugged his refrigerator, weighing over 500 lbs, and carried it up through eight flights of stairs of his hometown 9-storied apartment building. Karelin also took part in a strongman competition, that being the 1991 European Hercules, and without prior preparation, he managed to place 8th.

===Wrestling style===
Karelin was famous for his reverse body lift, the Karelin Lift, where facing the opponent who was lying flat on the mat to keep from being thrown, Karelin hoisted his opponents into the air and slammed him violently to the mat. This devastatingly effective maneuver, when properly executed, awarded Karelin 5 points per throw, the maximum awarded in Greco-Roman wrestling. The throw had long been in use by lighter wrestlers but not by heavyweights – because of the immense strength required to raise, spin and hit the mat with a 560+ lbs combined weight of both athletes (280+ of which resist desperately to the performed maneuver). Karelin&#x27;s ability to perform this throw against elite opponents weighing as much as 130 kg amazed other participants and observers of the sport. His exceptionally long reach, with measurements between and , helped him to grip his opponents&#x27; bodies. Furthermore, his incredible grip strength was described as being similar to that of &quot;an anaconda&quot;, which allowed him to hold down his opponents and prevent them from escaping from his grasp. His strength, size, explosiveness, flexibility and agility led Joe Rogan to describe Karelin as a &quot;human panther&quot;.

===Injuries===
Like most top wrestlers, Karelin had a number of severe injuries through his career. He credits his fast recoveries to Valery Okhapkin, physician of the national wrestling team, and claims that Okhapkin extended his competition lifetime by several years.

At the age of 15, Karelin broke his leg while training; having learned about this accident, his mother burned his wrestling uniform and forbade him to wrestle. At the 1988 USSR Championships, Karelin won and also defeated Igor Rostorotsky in a rematch, despite suffering from a concussion and high temperature. He won the 1993 World Championships despite breaking two ribs in the opening bout against Matt Ghaffari. Another injury occurred at the 1996 European Championships in Budapest, as he had torn the right pectoralis major muscle so badly that doctors predicted he would not be able to use his right hand for several months. Karelin won the Championships, but he had to be urgently operated on in Budapest. Despite not being fully recovered, he won the 1996 Olympics three months later. He has avoided multiple ear cartilage injuries of both ears, unlike many wrestlers.

==Political career==

Between 1995 and 1999, Karelin served with the Russian tax police and retired in the rank of colonel. Upon invitation from Vladimir Putin, in 1999, he began his political career. He joined the United Russia party and was elected to the State Duma as a representative of Novosibirsk Oblast in 1999 and 2003. In 2007, he was elected to the Duma as a representative of Stavropol Krai. He was a member of Duma&#x27;s committee on international affairs. In 2017, he entered the PutinTeam, a social movement aimed at promoting Vladimir Putin&#x27;s policies.

In 2020, Karelin was appointed as senator from the Legislative Assembly of Novosibirsk Oblast in the Federation Council. He took up the post on 25 September 2020, and is a member of the council&#x27;s committee on International Affairs. He was sanctioned by the United Kingdom in 2022 in relation to the Russo-Ukrainian War.

==Personal life==
Karelin graduated from the Novosibirsk Institute of Transportation in 1985, followed by the Siberian Academy of Physical Culture, a military school of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD USSR) and the Saint Petersburg University of MVD USSR. In 1998 he defended a PhD and in 2002 a habilitation in sport-related pedagogy; he also holds a degree in law. His PhD is titled: &quot;Methods of execution of suplex throw counters&quot; (), and &quot;Integral training system for top-level wrestlers&quot; ().

Karelin&#x27;s father was a truck driver and an amateur boxer. Karelin is married to Olga, they have two sons, Denis and Ivan, and one daughter, Vasilisa. Denis (born c. 1986) tried wrestling, but gave it up in favor of car racing. Ivan (born 1994) is coached by Kuznetsov and competes in the Greco-Roman superheavyweight division. Vasilisa (born c. 1999) is a rhythmic gymnast. Karelin had an older brother, Sergei Aleksandrovich Karelin, who died in 2017 at the age of 56. 

Karelin is an Orthodox Christian. Since he was young, Karelin has sought to be a &quot;classical man&quot;, and is well-versed in music and literature, with an interpreter of his stating &quot;His knowledge and his feeling for poetry, literature and music are incredible.&quot;

Starting in 1985, he served in the West Siberian Directorate of the Internal Troops of the USSR and Russia. While serving in the Internal Troops, he competed in sambo, and became a sambo champion. 

From 1986 to 1991, Karelin served as a sports instructor of the 2nd category for the West Siberian Directorate, then sports instructor of the highest qualification from 1991 to 1992, and then coach of the sports team from 1992 to 1995.

==Legacy and awards==

Karelin was named as the greatest Greco-Roman wrestler of the 20th century by the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA), and is one of the class of ten inaugural inductees into the FILA International Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2007, Karelin, alongside Buvaisar Saitiev, were voted the best wrestlers in the history of the sport by FILA. Four times he was awarded the &quot;Golden Belt&quot; as the best wrestler of the planet by FILA - in 1989, 1990, 1992, and 1994. He was also included in the 25 best world athletes of the 20th century. Since 1992, an annual wrestling competition is held in Novosibirsk in his honor.

He is cited as being one of the most dominant athletes of all time, and as being one of the greatest of all time. He is also remembered as being one of the most feared and intimidating athletes ever. He is also seen as one of the most gifted athletes of all time due to his combination of explosiveness, strength, intellect, flexibility, and agility.

He has been praised as one of the greatest wrestlers ever by, or usually as the single greatest ever, by other combat athletes like Abdulrashid Sadulaev, Alexander Romanov, Mark Madsen, Juha Ahokas, and even by Rulon Gardner himself.

Rulon Gardner stated about Karelin that:Karelin was named a Hero of the Russian Federation in 1996 and awarded the Order of Friendship of Peoples (1989), Order of Honour (2001) and Order &quot;For Merit to the Fatherland&quot; IV class (2008). He was awarded the Serbian Order of Saint Sava. In 2017, he was awarded the Order &quot;For Merit to the Republic of Dagestan&quot;. He was also named a Merited Master of Sports of the USSR (1988).

He is a hidden playable character in the Japan-only, AKI Corporation-created, Nintendo 64 video game: Virtual Pro Wrestling 2.

<doc id="622609" wikidata="Q6245009" url="?curid=622609" title="John Livingston Lowes">
<text>John Livingston Lowes (December 20, 1867 – August 15, 1945) was an American scholar and critic of English literature, specializing in Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Geoffrey Chaucer.

==Life==
John Livingston Lowes was born in Decatur, Indiana on December 20, 1867. He earned a B.A. from Washington and Jefferson College in 1888 and did postgraduate work in Germany and at Harvard University. He taught mathematics at Washington and Jefferson College until 1891 when he received his M.A.

From 1909 to 1918 he worked as an English professor at Washington University in St. Louis, where he also served as dean of arts and sciences. From 1918 to 1939 he taught English at Harvard. In 1919 he was the Lowell Institute lecturer and the author of &quot;Convention and Revolt in Poetry&quot;. His grandfather was David Elliott, who had served as President of Washington College.

Lowes was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1921 and the American Philosophical Society in 1934.
He was the first Eastman Professor at the University of Oxford in 1930-31, attached to Balliol College.

Lowes died in Boston, Massachusetts on August 15, 1945, aged 77.

==Works==

===Coleridge===
Lowes&#x27; most famous work is &quot;The Road to Xanadu: A Study in the Ways of the Imagination&quot; (Houghton Mifflin, 1927), which examines the sources of Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; and &quot;Kubla Khan.&quot; Using Coleridge&#x27;s notebook and other papers at the Bristol Library, Lowes put together a list of books that the poet read before and during the time he composed his poems. The trick was to connect images and ideas in the poems to images and ideas in Coleridge&#x27;s reading. Though later critics have disputed both Lowes&#x27; findings and method, &quot;The Road to Xanadu&quot;, according to English author Toby Litt, is &quot;a book of a lifetime&quot;: &quot;Its argument, that Coleridge had one of the most extraordinary minds the world has ever seen, is there on every page&quot;; it &quot;is one of the books which helped me understand what writing is.&quot;

===Chaucer===
Lowes&#x27; book on Chaucer (1934), building on the work of George Lyman Kittredge, treats the poet not just as the &quot;father of English poetry&quot; but as, along with Shakespeare and Milton, English literature&#x27;s greatest poet. The book greatly influenced E. Talbot Donaldson and other eminent mid-20th-century Chaucerians.

===Critiques and other writings===
*&quot;The Prologue to the Legend of Good Women Considered in Its Chronological Relations&quot; was published by Lowes in 1905
* &quot;Convention and Revolt in Poetry&quot; following up in 1919 with his major critique on Free Verse and poetry 
*&quot;Of Reading Books - Four Essays&quot; followed in 1929 and
* &quot;Selected Poems of Amy Lowell&quot; as editor in 1928 with
* &quot;Essays in appreciation&quot; - first published in 1936 and 
* &quot;A Leaf from the 1611 King James Bible&quot; in 1937

<doc id="622615" wikidata="Q5006927" url="?curid=622615" title="C. Vernon Mason">
<text>C. Vernon Mason is a former lawyer and civil rights advocate from Tucker, Arkansas. Best known for his involvement in several high-profile New York City cases in the 1980s, including the Bernhard Goetz, Howard Beach, and Tawana Brawley incidents, Mason has not practiced law since his 1995 disbarment. He then was the CEO of a non-profit organization. He is also an ordained minister.

==Education==
Mason graduated from Morehouse College and earned a Master in Business Administration from Indiana University Bloomington. He then graduated from Columbia Law School earning a Juris Doctor and, later, earned the Master of Divinity, and the Doctor of Ministry degree from New York Theological Seminary.

==Notable cases==
In 1983 Mason and William Kunstler represented serial killer Lemuel Smith at his trial for the murder of Donna Payant. 

Mason was co-counsel for Darrell Cabey, one of the four men shot by Bernhard Goetz in the famous 1984 &quot;subway vigilante&quot; case.

Mason was one of the lawyers retained by the family of Michael Griffith, manslaughter victim in the Howard Beach incident.

In 1987 Mason, along with Alton H. Maddox and Al Sharpton, were advisors to Tawana Brawley, an African-American teenager who claimed to have been abducted and sexually assaulted by at least three white men, including at least one police officer and assistant district attorney Steven Pagones. However, a grand jury investigation into Brawley&#x27;s allegations determined that she &quot;had not been abducted, assaulted, raped and sodomized as had been claimed&quot; and that &quot;the &#x27;unsworn public allegations against Dutchess County Assistant District Attorney Steven Pagones&#x27; were false and had no basis in fact.&quot; Pagones filed a $385 million lawsuit against Brawley and her advisors for 22 purported defamatory statements; Mason was found liable of making one defamatory statement and ordered to pay $185,000.

==Disbarment==
Mason was disbarred by the New York State Appellate Division, First Department, in 1995. 
The court cited 66 instances of professional misconduct with 20 clients over the course of 6 years as its rationale for the action, including &quot;repeated neglect of client matters, many of which concerned criminal cases where a client&#x27;s liberty was at stake; misrepresentations to clients [and] refusal to refund the unearned portion of fees&quot;. Though Mason&#x27;s involvement in the Brawley case was not specifically cited, Mason would allege that the ruling was intended to punish him for the Brawley case.

Henson was born on November 3, 1963 in New York City, the third child of Jane Henson (née Nebel; 1934–2013) and Jim Henson (1936–1990). He has four siblings: Lisa (born 1960), Cheryl (born 1961), John (1965–2014) and Heather Henson (born 1970).

As a child, Henson appeared in some of the filmed segments that his father produced for the PBS children&#x27;s series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

As a teenager, he built the first Muppet penguin puppet for the opening &quot;Lullaby of Broadway&quot; segment of a Season 3 episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. During his summer break from high school at the age of 17, Henson assisted in the production of &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; (1981); skilled in the use of marionette puppets, he helped create and operate a special rigging device that allowed the Muppets to appear to ride bicycles. Several years later, after performing marionette work in &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; (1984) in the scene in which rats cook food in a diner, he specialized in managing complicated special effects.

== Career ==

Henson performed Jack Pumpkinhead in &quot;Return to Oz&quot; (1985), operated special effects for &quot;Santa Claus: The Movie&quot; (1985) and was a principal performer for the Audrey II puppet in &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (1986), controlling mouth movement while others performed the lips and vines. He also performed the voice of Hoggle, one of the main characters in his father&#x27;s film &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (1986), and the dog in both versions of &quot;The Storyteller&quot; (1988 and 1990).

In 1992, Henson directed &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; and directed the next film in the franchise, &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot;, in 1996. He performed the role of Dr. Phil van Neuter, the Muppet mad scientist character he performed on &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;, in &quot;Muppets from Space&quot; (1999). In 2018, he directed and produced &quot;The Happytime Murders&quot;, a puppet crime-comedy film for adult audiences.

Henson was the executive producer for several television series: &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; (1991–94), &quot;Aliens in the Family&quot; (1996), &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House&quot; (1997–2006) and &quot;Farscape&quot; (1999–2003). In addition to assuming an executive producer role, Henson served as the head judge on the 2014 reality television show &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop Challenge&quot;. He performed the roles of Janice and Scooter in the 2002 television film &quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot;.

Henson returned to perform Sal Minella, a character he created for &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;, in &quot;Muppets Haunted Mansion&quot; (2021).

=== Other ventures ===
Henson is the cocreator, producer and performer for the adult-themed puppet-based variety show Puppet Up!, and has played various characters from the show on the British program &quot;That Puppet Game Show&quot;.

<doc id="622639" wikidata="Q507602" url="?curid=622639" title="Britny Fox">
<text>Britny Fox is an American glam metal band from the Philadelphia area, initially active from 1985 to 1992 then subsequently reforming from 2000 to 2003, again in 2006 to 2008 and final time reforming in 2015 to 2016. They are best known for their music video for &quot;Girlschool&quot; and their minor hit &quot;Long Way to Love&quot; (U.S. No. 100). Bassist Billy Childs has been the only band member to be a part of each of the band&#x27;s many lineups.
== History ==

=== Original lineup (1985–1992) ===
Britny Fox formed in 1985 in Philadelphia. The band was originally fronted by lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist &quot;Dizzy&quot; Dean Davidson. The band also featured Billy Childs on bass, former Cinderella guitarist Michael Kelly Smith on lead guitar and former Cinderella drummer Tony Destra on drums. The idea for the band&#x27;s name was inspired by Davidson, who named the band in honor of a Welsh ancestor. They were described on a compilation as &quot;trashy Victorian glam&quot;.

Thanks to their connections to Cinderella, the band was able to secure a major recording contract. However, the band encountered difficulties when Destra was killed in a car accident on February 8, 1987. Facing a tour, they hired drummer Adam West (aka Adam Ferraioli) temporarily until landing what turned out to be long-term drummer, John DiTeodoro (Johnny Dee), who had been the drummer for the band Waysted.

The band released a demo in 1986 titled &quot;In America&quot;, which late drummer Tony Destra played on, and a demo in 1987 titled &quot;Rock Is Gonna Fight&quot;, on which the band&#x27;s new drummer Adam West played. The band&#x27;s self-titled debut album, released in 1988, was one of the most successful debuts of the 1988–89 season, achieving RIAA gold status (500,000+ copies). The band held more than 130 shows, which attracted more than 625,000 fans cumulatively; during these shows, the band mostly performed as supporting acts to Poison and Ratt, although in a few shows, they headlined with Warrant as their opening act. They also won &quot;Metal Edge&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1988 Reader&#x27;s Choice Award for Best New Band.

After the release of the band&#x27;s second album in 1989, &quot;Boys in Heat&quot;, Davidson departed, and formed the band Blackeyed Susan. He was replaced by Las Vegas native Tommy Paris aka Don Jillson formerly of the band Jillson. Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Zakk Wylde and Poison drummer Rikki Rockett guested on the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Bite Down Hard&quot;, which was released in 1991. However, the popularity of glam metal was on a decline around the time of the album&#x27;s release, due to the rising popularity of the alternative rock/grunge movement. Britny Fox disbanded in 1992 for various reasons.

=== Reunions (2000–present) ===

Britny Fox reunited in 2000 with the same lineup before their disbandment and released a fourth studio album, &quot;Springhead Motorshark&quot;, in 2003. The band toured the US and Europe in 2007 and 2008. Guitarist Tommy Krash and former White Lion drummer Greg D&#x27;Angelo was supposed to join at that time, but he broke his foot during rehearsal and was replaced by Henry Now.

As of late 2007, Britny Fox reformed under original bassist Billy Childs. The other former members of this lineup were lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Jamie Fletcher, lead guitarist Greg Polcari, and drummer Henry Now.

Bassist Billy Childs and the new lineup had a minor but billed role in the horror film &quot;Incest Death Squad&quot; (2009). Childs also played bass in the North American Led Zeppelin tribute band Get the Led Out.

In 2010, Dean Davidson unsuccessfully attempted to reunite the surviving members of the original lineup.

On April 25, 2015, the band announced that they had reunited with bassist Billy Childs, drummer Johnny Dee, long-time singer/rhythm guitarist Tommy Paris, and new lead guitarist Chris Sanders as their lineup and that they were recording a new album. In a 2017 interview, Childs stated that the album project had been abandoned, but he stopped short of saying that the band had broken up. In 2018, Sanders joined fellow glam metal band Ratt.

In 2022, Billy Childs formed his own incarnation of Britny Fox without the involvement of any other past members. They toured throughout 2023.

More recently in 2023, former lead guitarist Michael Kelly Smith confirmed in several new interviews that he was in touch with all surviving original members and was considering bringing an official version of the band back for a reunion with the lineup from the first two albums. Smith also teased the possibility of a new studio album.

<doc id="622652" wikidata="Q61836" url="?curid=622652" title="Hermann von Struve">
<text>Karl Hermann von Struve ( – 12 August 1920) was a Baltic German astronomer. In Russian, his name is sometimes given as &quot;German Ottovich Struve&quot; (Герман Оттович Струве) or &quot;German Ottonovich Struve&quot; (Герман Оттонович Струве).

Hermann von Struve was a part of the famous group of astronomers from the Struve family, which also included his grandfather Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve, father Otto Wilhelm von Struve, brother Ludwig Struve and nephew Otto Struve. Unlike other astronomers of the Struve family, Herman spent most of his career in Germany. Continuing the family tradition, Struve&#x27;s research was focused on determining the positions of stellar objects. He was particularly known for his work on satellites of planets of the Solar System and development of the intersatellite method of correcting their orbital position. The mathematical Struve function is named after him.

==Biography==
Herman was born in 1854 in Tsarskoye Selo, a former Russian residence of the imperial family and visiting nobility, located south from the center of St. Petersburg. He attended gymnasium in Vyborg and in 1872 entered the Imperial University of Dorpat (now known as Tartu). While studying there, in 1874–1875, Struve participated in an expedition to observe transit of Venus through the disk of the Sun. That observation was carried out at Port Poisset on the Asiatic East Coast. After graduation in 1877, he became a member of the Pulkovo Observatory and was sent abroad for two-year post-graduate studies. Accompanied by his cousin&#x27;s husband, Struve stayed in several cities, including Straßburg (), Paris, Milan, Graz and Berlin, learning from such celebrities as Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, Boltzmann and Weierstrass. After returning to Russia, he joined the staff of Pulkovo Observatory, studying the satellites of Saturn among other things.

In 1881, Struve obtained his master&#x27;s degree at the Imperial University of Dorpat, with the highest honors, and in 1882 defended a PhD thesis at Saint Petersburg University (Pulkovo had no associated educational institutions). Both works were in the field of optics, in particular, the master thesis was titled &quot;On Fresnel interference phenomenon – theoretical and experimental work&quot;—according to Struve himself, despite the family traditions, he did not intend then to become an astronomer. Later, however, he became excited with his father&#x27;s project of building a 30-inch telescope at Pulkovo, with its fantastic new possibilities for observation. Struve made extensive use of this telescope in his work. In 1883, he was appointed adjunct astronomer at Pulkovo Observatory.

By then, the Struve family was highly respected in Russia and Tsar Alexander III had a strong wish for Hermann to succeed his father Otto as the director of the Pulkovo Observatory. However, Hermann politely declined the offer, mentioning that he was in the middle of crucial observations of Saturn which would be interrupted by administrative tasks. In 1890, Struve was appointed as the senior astronomer at Pulkovo with the understanding that he should become director after completing his Saturn work. However, the death of Alexander III in 1894 freed Struve from this task. Pro-Russian views were gradually developing in Russian society, including science, and foreigners felt progressively more alienated. Therefore, when in 1895 Struve was offered the position of professor at Königsberg University, he gladly accepted and moved his family to Germany. There, he succeeded Wilhelm Julius Foerster as director of Königsberg Observatory. Struve was also called for the task of rescuing the Berlin Observatory. It was then located in the center of Berlin where astronomy observations were not practical and rents were too high, and discussions of its relocation stalled. Struve managed to sell the old observatory site so profitably that he could build a new observatory from scratch. The location was chosen at Neubabelsberg, near Potsdam and from the center of Berlin, and the new institution was named Berlin-Babelsberg Observatory. There, he started installing a 26-inch Zeiss refractor and a 48-inch reflector, which would then become the largest telescope in Germany. While he did not get to operate them himself due to delays caused by World War I, the refractor was much used by his son Georg, and the reflector by his lesser-known grandson Wilfried.
In 1905, Struve became professor of the University of Berlin and from 1904 until his death in 1920, he served as director of the Berlin-Babelsberg Observatory. Struve&#x27;s death was accelerated by a heart illness which he suffered from during his late years and by a bad fall from a tram car in 1919. He broke a thigh, and while recovering in a sanatorium in Bad Herrenalb, died of a heart attack.

==Family matters==
Whereas many colleagues described Struve as a stern and serious person, within his family, he was seen as a cultivated man, who enjoyed music and friends and was very proud of the Struve family traditions. Yet even among relatives, he was known as inflexible in matters of principle.

In 1885, Struve married the daughter of a cousin of his father. They had a son, Georg Otto Hermann, and a daughter, Elisabeth. George was born on 29 December 1886 in Tsarskoye Selo, Russia, and later became a famous astronomer. Hermann&#x27;s wife Eva Struve played an important role in rescuing his nephew Otto. After escaping from Soviet Russia in 1920, for a year and a half he was stranded penniless in Turkey. Otto wrote to his uncle for help, unaware of his death, but Eva asked assistance of Paul Guthnick, her late husband&#x27;s successor at the Berlin-Babelsberg Observatory. Whereas Guthnick was not in a position to offer a job to Struve in Germany, he highly recommended Struve to the director of Yerkes Observatory in Chicago, who not only found a job for Struve at Yerkes, but also arranged a visa for him and paid for his travel.

==Research==
As with all astronomers of the Struve family, Herman was mostly working on establishing positions and movements of single and double stars and satellites of the planets of the Solar System. In 1885, a 30-inch refracting telescope was installed at Pulkovo, at the time the largest in the world (a great refractor). Struve was the first user of that telescope, which he used mostly for determining positions of a large number of double stars. His other major topic was Saturn, but he also studied Mars, Neptune and the fifth moon of Jupiter. He could not observe Uranus from Pulkovo because it was too far south. In 1888, Struve discovered libration of Hyperion (the seventh moon of Saturn) and explained it by the perturbing action of the largest Saturn&#x27;s moon, Titan. The same year, he introduced an intersatelite method of correcting orbital position of satellites. The method was rather successful because systematic errors in visual observations of some planets, such as Mars, were unacceptably large. Struve, however, realized that the method had flaws and recommended combining planet/satellite and intersatellite measurements. In 1892, Struve discovered libration of two other moons of Saturn, Mimas and Enceladus. His observations of the moon of Mars, Phobos, were later used by B. Sharpless in studying the secular acceleration of its orbit.

Struve was known not only as an astronomer, but also as a mathematician. In 1882, he introduced a function to describe the intensity of a luminous line. This function also describes solutions of Bessel&#x27;s differential equation; it therefore is widely used in mathematics and is named the Struve function.

After moving to Königsberg Observatory, Struve built a 32.5-inch refractor telescope there and continued his work on the moons of Saturn, the last observations of which he made in 1916. His other topics included a study of atmospheric refraction, stellar parallaxes, drawings of Jupiter, determination of the position of Mars&#x27; equator, the amount of its oblateness and the rate of motion of the nodes.

==Awards and honors==
In 1897, Struve received the Damoiseau Prize from the French Academy of Sciences and in 1903 the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, both for his work on satellites of Saturn. He was the third (after Friedrich Georg Wilhelm and Otto Wilhelm) member of Struve family to receive that medal. The asteroid 768 Struveana was named in honor of Herman, Otto Wilhelm and Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve.

<text>Delenn is a fictional lead character in the universe of the science fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. She is originally Minbari, but from season 2 onwards, becomes a Minbari/human hybrid. She was played by Mira Furlan.

== Role in &quot;Babylon 5&quot; ==
===Character arc===

When first appearing as the Minbari ambassador to Babylon 5, Delenn initially hides her status of being Satai, one of the nine members of the Grey Council, the ruling body of the Minbari Federation. At the start of the 2nd season, Delenn uses a special artifact to transform into a half-human, half-Minbari hybrid - initially treated with suspicion by humans and Minbari alike. She is excluded from the Grey Council as a consequence. Delenn was instrumental in also getting Sinclair to be stationed as the first Earth ambassador to Minbar, since unbeknownst to Sinclair initially, they chose him because he was the first human the Grey Council had any direct contact with during the Battle of the Line.

In season 3, Delenn and John Sheridan fall in love, which drives a further wedge between the Minbari religious and warrior castes, who soon break a thousand years of cooperation and begin a civil war against one another. After Sheridan and Babylon 5 break away from Earth, it is Delenn who rescues the station with a fleet of Minbari ships, but at the cost of destroying the symbolic circle of the Grey Council. The religious and worker castes side with Babylon 5 and the Army of Light. Without the Grey Council keeping order, the divisions in Minbari society become so strong that civil war soon breaks out. It is later learned that Delenn herself is descended from Valen. Delenn is the &quot;One who is,&quot; representing both halves of the Minbari and human race merged, more literally merging in the marriage of Delenn and Sheridan. Together they become war leaders, with Delenn managing to bind together diverse planets and races into a great alliance. Sheridan was the &quot;warrior&quot;, while she was the &quot;spirit&quot;. This alliance ends the great war between the Shadow and Vorlon races, and ushers in the Third age for Mankind - a great time of growth and change.

After the Shadow War ended, both Delenn and Sheridan find their homeworlds embroiled in civil wars. Although her work saves countless lives and ends the great war, she returns home to a world fraught with chaos and death. Delenn and the religious caste surrender to the warrior clans. She then forces a showdown between herself and the new leader of the warrior caste. This should be a purification in which Delenn can sacrifice herself for her caste and for the Minbari people. With her sacrifice, the leadership of Minbar would continue to be held by the religious caste - not the warriors. Her old rival Neroon saves her life, however, and in his death cries he joins the religious caste, which restores the balance of power. Delenn then gives control of the Grey Council to the worker caste, who had for many years stayed in the middle, as the religious and warrior castes simmered with disagreement. After John Sheridan refuses to stand for re-election as President of the Interstellar Alliance, Delenn is chosen to succeed him. When she accepts the role, Sheridan takes command of the Rangers until his death; Delenn asks Ivanova to succeed him.

=== Characterization ===

Delenn as a literary character has been subject to several literary analysis, for example as a hero and as a leader, as well as in the dimension of feminine identity.

== Conceptual history ==

Delenn was originally conceived as being a male character who would eventually become female, played by an actress to provide him with feminine mannerisms to make the eventual transformation believable. The &quot;Babylon 5&quot; pilot TV movie &quot;The Gathering&quot; was filmed with this in mind but attempts to digitally alter Mira Furlan&#x27;s voice to make it sound masculine were deemed unconvincing. Instead, the character was redesigned to be female. The Minbari makeup was also changed to give Delenn a more distinctly feminine appearance.

== Reception ==
* Inspiration: Fans have admired Delenn for her strength, empathy, and moral clarity. Her transformation from a Minbari ambassador to a key figure in interstellar diplomacy has resonated deeply with viewers.
* Memorable Lines: Delenn&#x27;s philosophical insights and powerful speeches, such as her declaration, &quot;“If you value your lives, be somewhere else!”&quot; have become iconic moments in science fiction television.
* Relationships: Her partnership with Captain John Sheridan, both as a political ally and a romantic companion, is seen as one of the most compelling and nuanced relationships in the genre.

<doc id="622659" wikidata="Q527647" url="?curid=622659" title="Roman Ghetto">
<text>The Roman Ghetto or Ghetto of Rome () was a Jewish ghetto established in 1555 by Pope Paul IV in the Rione Sant&#x27;Angelo, in Rome, Italy, in the area surrounded by present-day Via del Portico d&#x27;Ottavia, Lungotevere dei Cenci, Via del Progresso and Via di Santa Maria del Pianto, close to the River Tiber and the Theatre of Marcellus. With the exception of brief periods under Napoleon from 1808 to 1815 and under the Roman Republics of 1798–99 and 1849, the ghetto of Rome was controlled by the papacy until the capture of Rome in 1870.

==Creation==
The Jewish community of Rome is probably the oldest in the world outside of the Middle East, with a continuous existence from classical times down to the present day. The first record of Jews in Rome is in 161 BC, when Jason b. Eleazar and Eupolemus b. Johanan are said to have gone there as envoys from Judah Maccabee.

The Roman Ghetto was established as a result of papal bull &quot;Cum nimis absurdum&quot;, promulgated by Pope Paul IV on 14 July 1555. The bull also required the Jews of Rome, which had existed as a community since before Christian times and which numbered about 2,000 at the time, to live in the ghetto. The ghetto was a walled quarter with its gates locked at night. The wall was built under the direction of the architect Giovanni Sallustio Peruzzi. The cost of the wall&#x27;s construction, 300 Roman scudi, had to be paid by the Jewish community. The area of Rome chosen for the ghetto was one of the most undesirable quarters of the city, subject to constant flooding by the Tiber River, but where Jews amounted already to 80% of the population. At the time of its founding, the area was a trapezoid whose bases (parallel to the river) measured respectively (near the Tiber) and , and whose sides was about long. The wall started from Ponte Fabricio reaching the Portico d&#x27;Ottavia; from there it ran along today&#x27;s Via del Portico d&#x27;Ottavia (not including the ancient fish market ()); at Piazza Giudea (which was cut in two), it bent again, running along Vicolo Cenci (today Via del Progresso) until it reached the Tiber again. The total area amounted to three hectares. At the time of Sixtus V (late 1580s), roughly 3,500 inhabitants were living in inhuman conditions.

The bull also revoked all the rights of the Jewish community and imposed on Jews a variety of new restrictions, such as prohibition on property ownership and practicing medicine on Christians and compulsory Catholic sermons on the Jewish sabbath.

Jews were not allowed to own any property, even in the ghetto. Christian owners of houses in the ghetto could keep their property, but, because of the &quot;jus gazzagà&quot; (right of possession), they could neither evict the Jews nor raise rents.

Gates were added as the ghetto was successively enlarged. Initially, there were two gates in the wall. The number increased to three in the 16th century and under Sixtus V to five, and finally, during the 19th century to eight. The gates were opened at dawn and closed every night, one hour after sunset between November and Easter, and two hours at other times. The area contained hardly any noteworthy buildings. The only important square — Piazza Giudea — was divided in two parts by the wall. All the churches which stood in the ghetto were deconsecrated and demolished soon after its construction.

In common with many other Italian ghettoes, the ghetto of Rome was not initially so called, but was variously referred to in documents in Italian as &quot;serraglio degli Ebrei&quot; or &quot;claustro degli Ebrei&quot;, both meaning &quot;enclosure of the Hebrews&quot;. Various forms of the word &quot;ghetto&quot; came into use in the late 16th century. The modern Roman Jewish usage is .

==Life in the ghetto==
Life in the Roman Ghetto was one of crushing poverty, due to the severe restrictions placed upon the occupations that Jews were allowed to perform. Roman Jews were allowed to work only at unskilled jobs, such as ragmen, secondhand dealers or fish mongers. They were permitted to be pawnbrokers (which had been prohibited to Christians); and this activity excited the hatred of many Christians against them.

In the lottery game, they were allowed to bet only on low numbers (from 1 through 30), and all belonging to the same group of 10. In case of a draw of five numbers of that kind, the Romans said that on that day in the ghetto there was taking place a great feast.

When Jews went outside the ghetto, the men had to wear a yellow cloth (the &quot;sciamanno&quot;), and the women a yellow veil (the same color worn by prostitutes). During the feasts they had to amuse the Christians, competing in humiliating games. They had to run naked, with a rope around the neck, or with their legs closed into sacks. Sometimes they were also ridden by soldiers.

Jews had to petition annually for permission to live there. They paid a yearly tax for the privilege. Jews of Rome were required to swear yearly loyalty to the Pope at the Arch of Titus, which celebrates the Roman sack of Jerusalem of 70 CE. Each year, on the Campidoglio, the Rabbi had to pay homage to the chief of the city councillors (&quot;Caporione&quot;), receiving by him in exchange for it a kick to his bottom. This &quot;ceremony&quot; meant that the Jewish community had been allowed to stay one more year in Rome.

Every Saturday, the Jewish community was forced to hear compulsory sermons in front of the small church of San Gregorio a Ponte Quattro Capi, just outside the wall.

At the time of its construction, in the ghetto – as almost everywhere in Rome – there was no fresh water. However, some years later the Popes built several fountains in the rione. One fountain, designed by Giacomo della Porta, was to be placed in the Piazza Giudea, the site of a market, inside the ghetto, but Muzio Mattei used his influence to have the fountain, the Fontana delle Tartarughe (Turtle Fountain), located in the Piazza Mattei, in front of his residence.

As the Jewish community inside the ghetto grew, there was severe overcrowding. Since the area could not expand horizontally, the Jews built vertical additions to their houses, which blocked the sun from reaching the already dank and narrow streets.

The great number of people living in such a small area, together with the poverty of the population, caused terrible hygienic conditions. The district, lying very low and near the Tiber, was often flooded, and diseases like cholera and malaria were endemic. During the plague of 1656, 800 of the ghetto&#x27;s 4,000 inhabitants died. In 1867, just three years before the abolition of the ghetto, there was a cholera epidemic. Sant&#x27;Angelo, which was the smallest rione by area, also had the highest population density because of the presence of the ghetto.

==Abolition==

The first great upheaval since Paul IV established the ghetto came during the Napoleonic Wars. Eager to promulgate his own set of universal laws, Napoleon determined that every citizen under his rule would enjoy equal protection under the law. The Napoleonic Code eliminated many, if not all, of the special rights and privileges enjoyed by aristocratic and religious figures; conversely, they also removed the special restrictions and burdens placed on Jewish communities. In many countries, this meant an end to Jewish ghettos. Rome was no exception: when Napoleon&#x27;s forces made their triumphant entrance into the city, a special point was made of physically demolishing the old ghetto walls. This was not just a simple act of altruism. Napoleon was determined to show the Catholic Church that he was now the dominant power in Rome. In 1798 he abolished the Papal States and replaced them with a new Roman Republic, which quickly annulled the papal law requiring Jews to reside in the ghetto. To commemorate the event a Tree of Liberty was planted in Piazza delle Cinque Scole (&quot;Piazza of the Five Synagogues&quot;). However, when the Papal States were restored in 1799, the ghetto was reestablished and Jews who had left its confines were compelled to return.

During the 19th century it became clear the ghetto was becoming less and less sustainable. On 17 April 1847, a group of young men from Trastevere broke open the gates of the ghetto after they had been closed for the night. In 1848, at the liberal beginning of his pontificate, Pius IX permitted Jews to live outside the ghetto. Following a brief period of exile, however, during which time Rome was controlled by a second Roman Republic which strongly opposed Church power, the Pope issued a new series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the ghetto. The Jewish head tax was abolished in 1850.

The Papal States ceased to exist on 20 September 1870, when they were combined with the rest of the peninsula into the newly created Kingdom of Italy. With this dramatic change in governments, the requirement that Jews live in the ghetto came to an end. But the centuries of crowds, restrictions, and disease had taken their toll. While the Roman ghetto had once been home to some 10,000 Jews, by 1870 the population was less than half that—and half of those remaining relied on charity to survive. Indeed, the Risorgimento troops who arrived to wrest control of Rome&#x27;s government away from the Catholic Church were treated as liberators and conquering heroes by many Jewish residents. In 1888, the ghetto walls were torn down, and the ghetto itself was almost completely demolished. In 1904 the Great Synagogue of Rome and a number of apartment buildings were erected on the site. Embankments were created to prevent flooding and reduce the spread of disease.

The Roman Ghetto was the last remaining ghetto in Western Europe until ghettos were reintroduced by Nazi Germany in the 1930s.

==Legacy==
Due to the three hundred plus years of isolation from the rest of the city, the Jews of the Roman Ghetto developed their own dialect, known as Giudeo-romanesco, which differs from the dialect of the rest of the city in its preservation of 16th-century dialectical forms and its liberal use of romanized Hebrew words.

Today, the district of the former ghetto is the home of the Great Synagogue of Rome. There is one remaining piece of the ghetto wall, which was built into the wall of one of the courtyards off the Piazza delle Cinque Scole.
It is described as &quot;one of the Rome&#x27;s most charming and eclectic neighborhoods, [...with] restaurants serving up some of the best food in the city&quot;, such as the Roman Jewish speciality of fried artichokes, and filled zucchini blossoms, .

<doc id="622661" wikidata="Q366612" url="?curid=622661" title="Joe job">
<text>A Joe job is a spamming technique that sends out unsolicited e-mails using spoofed sender data. Early Joe jobs aimed at tarnishing the reputation of the apparent sender or inducing the recipients to take action against them (see also email spoofing), but they are now typically used by commercial spammers to conceal the true origin of their messages and to trick recipients into opening emails apparently coming from a trusted source.

==Origin and motivation==
The name &quot;Joe job&quot; originated from such a spam attack on Joe Doll, webmaster of joes.com, in early 1997. One user&#x27;s joes.com account was removed because of advertising through spam. In retaliation, the user sent new spam with headers forged to make it appear that Joe Doll was responsible. Besides prompting angry replies, it also caused joes.com to fall prey to denial-of-service attacks, from anti-spam vigilantes who thought he had sent the mail, which temporarily took the site down.

Some e-mail Joe jobs are acts of revenge like the original, whether by individuals or by organizations that also use spam for other purposes. Spammers use the technique to cycle through domains and to try to get around spam filters and blocks.

Joe-jobbers could also be businesses trying to defame a competitor or a spammer trying to harm the reputation of an anti-spam group or filtering service. Joe job attacks in other media are often motivated politically or through personal enmity.

==Form==
Joe jobs usually look like normal spam, although they might also disguise themselves as other types of scams or even as legitimate (but misdirected) messages.

Joe jobbing (or &quot;joeing&quot;) can take different forms, but most incidents involve either e-mail or Usenet. They are sometimes seen on instant messaging systems as well. In general, joe jobbing is seen only on messaging systems with weak or no sender authentication, or where most users will assume the purported sender to be the actual one.

If the Joe-jobber is imitating a normal spam, it will simply advertise the victim&#x27;s product, business or website. It may also claim that the victim is selling illegal or offensive items such as illegal drugs, automatic weapons or child pornography to increase the likelihood that the recipient will take action against the victim.

When imitating a scam, such as a Nigerian scam, or phishing scheme, the e-mail will still feature links to the victim&#x27;s website or include contact information. In these instances, the joe-jobber is hoping that the recipient will notice the e-mail is fake, but mistakenly think the victim is behind the &quot;scam&quot;.

When imitating a legitimate e-mail, the joe job will usually pose as an order confirmation. These &quot;confirmations&quot; may ask for credit card information, in which event the attack differs from phishing only in intent, not methodology, or simply imply that the recipient has already bought something from the store (leading the recipient to fear their credit card has already been charged). Like the &quot;normal spam&quot; jobs, these e-mails will often mention illegal activities to incite the recipient to angry e-mails and legal threats.

Another joe-job variation is an e-mail claiming that the victim offers a &quot;spam friendly&quot; web host or e-mail server in the hope of further inciting action against the victim by anti-spam activists.

==Function==
Joe jobs often intend to capitalize on general hatred for spam. They usually forge &quot;from&quot; addresses and email headers so that angry replies are directed to the victim. Some joe job attacks adopt deliberately inflammatory viewpoints, intending to deceive the recipient into believing they were sent by the victim. Joe job victims may lose website hosting or network connectivity due to complaints to their Internet service providers, and even face increased bandwidth costs (or server overload) due to increased website traffic. The victim may also find their email blacklisted by spam filters.

Unlike most email spam, the victim does not have to &quot;fall for&quot; or even receive the email in question; the perpetrator is using innocent third parties to fuel what essentially amounts to slander combined with a denial of service attack.

==Similar automated spam==
False headers are used by many viruses or spambots today, and are selected in a random or automated way, so it is possible for someone to be joe jobbed without any human intent or intervention.

<text>The People&#x27;s Rally for Progress (; , RPP) is a political party in Djibouti. It has dominated politics in the country since 1979, initially under the rule of President Hassan Gouled Aptidon. Today it is led by President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh and is in a coalition government with Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD) and other parties. The RPP tends to hold more influence among the Issa population.

The RPP was founded in Dikhil on March 4, 1979. It was declared the sole legal party in October 1981, retaining this status until multiparty politics was introduced in the September 1992 referendum. At the party congress held on 19–20 March 1997, Gouled Aptidon was re-elected as RPP President and a 125-member Central Committee was elected. It contested the December 1997 parliamentary election in alliance with the moderate faction of FRUD (which had signed a peace agreement with the government in December 1994), and this alliance won 79% of the vote, taking all 65 seats in the National Assembly.

On February 4, 1999, President Gouled Aptidon announced that he would retire at the time of the next election, and an extraordinary congress of the RPP, chose Guelleh as its presidential candidate. As the joint candidate of the RPP and moderate wing of the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD), Guelleh won the presidential election held on April 9, 1999 with 74% of the vote, defeating his only challenger, the independent candidate Moussa Ahmed Idriss.

In the parliamentary election held on 10 January 2003, the party was part of the Union for a Presidential Majority (&quot;Union pour la Majorité Présidentielle&quot;, UMP), that won 63% of the popular vote and all 65 seats.

The RPP opened its Eighth Ordinary Congress on March 4, 2004, coinciding with the party&#x27;s 25th anniversary. At this congress, Guelleh was unanimously re-elected as RPP President by acclamation for another three-year term, and the RPP Central Committee was expanded from 180 to 250 members. On March 4, 2007, the RPP held its Ninth Ordinary Congress; Guelleh was again re-elected as RPP President, and three women were added to the Political Bureau, expanding it to 17 members. It contested the February 2008 parliamentary election together with its UMP coalition partners, and the UMP again won all 65 seats amidst an opposition boycott.

<text>The Movement for Democratic Renewal and Development (), () is a political party in Djibouti. It was originally known as the Party for Democratic Renewal. The PRD of Djibouti was created with the purpose of forming a national democratic party. The PRD gained popularity at the collapse of the communist bloc and the end of the Cold War. It used its military power gained through its coalition with the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD) and the Movement for Peace and Reconciliation (MPR). The current leader of PRD is Abdillani Hamariteha.

The PRD was founded by Mohamed Djame Elabe, a former minister in the government, on 27 September 1992; it replaced the Movement for Peace and Reconciliation, a group founded by Djame in early 1992. The party participated in the December 1992 parliamentary election and won 24.41% of vote, although it obtained no representation in the National Assembly; no other opposition party participated in the election, and all seats were won by the ruling People&#x27;s Rally for Progress (RPP).

Standing as the PRD presidential candidate in the May 1993 presidential election, Djame placed second behind President Hassan Gouled Aptidon and received about 22% of the vote. Djame died on 26 November 1996, and the PRD held a congress on 23 May 1997, electing Hamariteha as PRD President, Maki Houmed Gaba as First Vice-President, and Carton Dibeth Oblik as Second Vice-President.

In the December 1997 parliamentary election, the PRD received 19.2% of the vote but again failed to win any seats. Together with the leaders of the Group for Democracy and the Republic and the Djibouti United Opposition Front, Hamariteha signed a communiqué providing for an alliance between the three groups on 25 November 1998. In the parliamentary election held on 10 January 2003, the PRD was part of the Union for a Democratic Change (&quot;Union pour l&#x27;Alternance Démocratique&quot;), which won 37.3% of the popular vote but no seats in the National Assembly.

<doc id="622714" wikidata="Q578741" url="?curid=622714" title="Brillouin scattering">
<text>In electromagnetism, Brillouin scattering (also known as Brillouin light scattering or BLS), named after Léon Brillouin, refers to the interaction of light with the material waves in a medium (e.g. electrostriction and magnetostriction). It is mediated by the refractive index dependence on the material properties of the medium; as described in optics, the &quot;index of refraction&quot; of a transparent material changes under deformation (compression-distension or shear-skewing).

The result of the interaction between the light-wave and the carrier-deformation wave is that a fraction of the transmitted light-wave changes its momentum (thus its frequency and energy) in preferential directions, as if by diffraction caused by an oscillating 3-dimensional diffraction grating.

If the medium is a solid crystal, a macromolecular chain condensate or a viscous liquid or gas, then the low frequency atomic-chain-deformation waves within the transmitting medium (not the transmitted electro-magnetic wave) in the carrier (represented as a quasiparticle) could be for example:
# mass oscillation (acoustic) modes (called phonons);
# charge displacement modes (in dielectrics, called polarons); 
# magnetic spin oscillation modes (in magnetic materials, called magnons).

== Mechanism ==
From the perspective of solid state physics, Brillouin scattering is an interaction between an electromagnetic wave and one of the three above-mentioned crystalline lattice waves (e.g. electrostriction and magnetostriction). The scattering is inelastic i.e. the photon may lose energy (Stokes process) and in the process create one of the three quasiparticle types (phonon, polariton, magnon) or it may gain energy (anti-Stokes process) by absorbing one of those quasiparticle types. Such a shift in photon energy, corresponding to a &quot;Brillouin shift&quot; in frequency, is equal to the energy of the released or absorbed quasiparticle. Thus, Brillouin scattering can be used to measure the energies, wavelengths and frequencies of various atomic chain oscillation types (&#x27;quasiparticles&#x27;). To measure a Brillouin shift a commonly employed device called the Brillouin spectrometer is used, the design of which is derived from a Fabry–Pérot interferometer. Alternatively, high-speed photodiodes, such as those recovered from inexpensive 25-gigabit Ethernet optical transceivers, may be used in combination with a software-defined radio or RF spectrum analyzer.

==Contrast with Rayleigh scattering==
Rayleigh scattering, too, can be considered to be due to fluctuations in the density, composition and orientation of molecules within the transmitting medium, and hence of its refraction index, in small volumes of matter (particularly in gases or liquids). The difference is that Rayleigh scattering involves only the random and incoherent thermal fluctuations, in contrast with the correlated, periodic fluctuations (phonons) that cause Brillouin scattering. Moreover, Rayleigh scattering is elastic in that no energy is lost or gained.

==Contrast with Raman scattering==
Raman scattering is another phenomenon that involves inelastic scattering of light caused by the vibrational properties of matter. The detected range of frequency shifts and other effects are very different compared to Brillouin scattering. In Raman scattering, photons are scattered by the effect of vibrational and rotational transitions in the bonds between first-order neighboring atoms, while Brillouin scattering results from the scattering of photons caused by large scale, low-frequency phonons. The effects of the two phenomena provide very different information about the sample: Raman spectroscopy can be used to determine the transmitting medium&#x27;s chemical composition and molecular structure, while Brillouin scattering can be used to measure the material&#x27;s properties on a larger scale – such as its elastic behavior. The frequency shifts from Brillouin scattering, a technique known as Brillouin spectroscopy, are detected with an interferometer while Raman scattering uses either an interferometer or a dispersive (grating) spectrometer.

==Stimulated Brillouin scattering==
For intense beams of light (e.g. laser) traveling in a medium or in a waveguide, such as an optical fiber, the variations in the electric field of the beam itself may induce acoustic vibrations in the medium via electrostriction or radiation pressure. The beam may display Brillouin scattering as a result of those vibrations, usually in the direction opposite the incoming beam, a phenomenon known as stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). For liquids and gases, the frequency shifts typically created are of the order of 1–10 GHz resulting in wavelength shifts of ~1–10 pm in the visible light. Stimulated Brillouin scattering is one effect by which optical phase conjugation can take place.

==Discovery==
Inelastic scattering of light caused by acoustic phonons was first predicted by Léon Brillouin in 1914

. Leonid Mandelstam is believed to have recognised the possibility of such scattering as early as 1918, but he published his idea only in 1926.
In order to credit Mandelstam, the effect is also called Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering (BMS). Other commonly used names are Brillouin light scattering (BLS) and Brillouin-Mandelstam light scattering (BMLS).

The process of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) was first observed by Chiao &quot;et al.&quot; in 1964. The optical phase conjugation aspect of the SBS process was discovered by Boris Yakovlevich Zeldovich &quot;et al.&quot; in 1972.

==Fiber optic sensing==
Brillouin scattering can also be employed to sense mechanical strain and temperature in optical fibers.

<text>The National Democratic Party () () is a political party in Djibouti. It was founded as an opposition party in 1992 by Aden Robleh Awaleh, who remains the party&#x27;s president. It was part of the ruling coalition in 2005, but has since rejoined the opposition against President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh.

The PND was founded on 13 September 1992, and it boycotted the December 1992 parliamentary election. Seeking greater democracy, it then called for a transitional national unity government to be formed. Awaleh stood as the party&#x27;s candidate in the May 1993 presidential election, receiving 12% of the vote and placing third.

On 27 October 1995, a PND protest was broken up by the police and many PND members, including Awaleh, were arrested. The party participated in the December 1997 parliamentary election, but failed to win any seats, obtaining 2.3% of the vote. The PND only presented candidates in Ali Sabieh Region in the 1997 election, and it performed well there, losing to the ruling coalition by only 500 votes.

The PND experienced internal division in the late 1990s. In May 1997, Awaleh suspended PND spokesman Farah Ali Wabert from the party, a move that reportedly exacerbated the situation. By November 1998, a rival leadership under Mahdi Ahmed Abdillahié controlled the PND headquarters, and in the same month, the PND headquarters was attacked with a grenade; there was no claim of responsibility for the attack. The factions apparently reconciled by 2002.

The PND subsequently joined the ruling coalition, the Union for a Presidential Majority (&quot;Union pour la Majorité Présidentielle&quot;, UMP). In the parliamentary election held on 10 January 2003, the party was included in the joint candidate lists of the UMP, which won 62.7% of the popular vote and all seats. The PND subsequently supported Guelleh in the April 2005 presidential election, and it remained part of the UMP in the February 2008 parliamentary election.

The PND split from the ruling coalition in 2010 after Guelleh pushed through constitutional changes allowing him to run for a third term. The party joined the opposition boycott of the 2011 election.

<text>The Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy ( (FRUD), ) is a political party in Djibouti. It is aligned with the interests of the Afar people who live in the country, although it has supporters residing outside of Djibouti.

== History ==
===Uprising against the government and party split===
Three Afar groups—Action for the Revision of Order in Djibouti, the Front for the Restoration of Right and Equality, and the Djibouti Patriotic Resistance Front—merged in 1991 to form FRUD. In late 1991, FRUD launched a rebellion against the Issa-dominated government.

Nearly 1,000 people died during the conflict until 1994. In that year, the party split into two factions: a moderate wing, led by Ali Mohamed Daoud, signed a peace agreement with the government on 26 December 1994 in Aba&#x27;a, while other wing, led by Ahmed Dini Ahmed, denounced this agreement and continued armed resistance. The radicals held a congress in northern Djibouti for six days in late September 1994, and announced on 30 September 1994 that the congress delegates &quot;unanimously reaffirmed their determination to pursue armed struggle until their political goals are satisfied,&quot; while electing Dini at the head of the faction&#x27;s executive committee.

===Insurgency by FRUD-C===
After the party&#x27;s split, the FRUD-C (Front pour la restauration de l’unité et de la démocratie – Combattant, or Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy – Combatant; alternatively called &quot;FRUD Ahmed Dini faction&quot;, &quot;FRUD-Radicals&quot;, &quot;FRUD-Armé&quot; or &quot;Armed FRUD&quot;) was organized by those FRUD members determined to keep fighting. They continued an insurgency against the government of Djibouti with the support of Eritrea with arms and probably logistics in an effort to cut the supply routes from Djibouti to landlocked Ethiopia during the Eritrean–Ethiopian War. Up to 2014, the insurgency caused 100 deaths.

Since then, there have only been few attacks. In January 2021, FRUD-C killed a policeman. On 7 October 2022, FRUD-C attacked a military barracks in Garabtisan, killing seven soldiers, wounding four. Six were reported as missing. This assault was strongly denounced not only by Djibouti&#x27;s government, but also FRUD&#x27;s moderate faction as &quot;unjustifiable in the current context of political pluralism.&quot;

===Activity of the moderate faction===
While the radical FRUD elements continued to fight, the Daoud faction began to participate in national politics.

As a result of its December 1994 agreement with the government, the moderate faction was given two ministerial positions on 8 June 1995: FRUD President Daoud became Minister of Health and Social Affairs, while FRUD Secretary-General Ougoure Kifle Ahmed became Minister of Agriculture and Water Resources. The moderate faction was formally legalized in March 1996. On 15–16 April 1997, it held its First Ordinary Congress, electing a 153-member National Council and a 21-member Executive Committee. Although the party continued to be led by Daoud, who is an Afar, the composition of the leadership selected at this congress reflected the party&#x27;s efforts to appeal to other ethnic groups aside from its Afar base. Djama Djellai, an Issa, was chosen as First Vice-President, and Ismael Youssouf, a Gadabursi, was chosen as Second Vice-President. The Executive Committee included several representatives of ethnic groups aside from the Afar: four were Issa, two were Gadabursi, two were Arabs, and one was Isaaq. FRUD took part in the December 1997 parliamentary election in alliance with the ruling People&#x27;s Rally for Progress (RPP), and this alliance won 78.5% of the vote, taking all 65 seats in the National Assembly.

====1999 presidential election====
Ismail Omar Guelleh of the RPP stood in the presidential election held on April 9, 1999, as the joint candidate of the RPP and FRUD, receiving 74.02% of the vote. Prior to the election, Abatte Ebo Adou, a FRUD parliamentary deputy, announced that he would stand as a presidential candidate and was expelled from FRUD as a result.

For its part, the radical faction eventually signed its own peace agreement with the government in 2001.

FRUD held its Second Ordinary Congress on 28–29 April 2002. Daoud was re-elected as FRUD President at this congress, and the party&#x27;s Executive Committee was reduced from 27 to 19 members.

====2003 parliamentary election====
In the parliamentary election held on 10 January 2003, the moderate faction was part of the Union for the Presidential Majority (&quot;Union pour la Majorité Présidentielle&quot;, UMP), which won 62.7% of the popular vote and all seats. The radical faction participated in the election as part of the opposition coalition, the Union for a Democratic Change.

====Third Ordinary Congress====
The moderate faction held its Third Ordinary Congress, attended by 1,250 delegates, on 30–31 May 2007. Daoud was re-elected as President of FRUD by acclamation, without opposition. At the congress, FRUD&#x27;s National Council was expanded to 335 members; the FRUD Executive Committee named at this congress included 26 members, four of whom were women. FRUD was again part of the UMP for the February 2008 parliamentary election; the UMP again won all seats amidst an opposition boycott.

<doc id="622718" wikidata="Q5154293" url="?curid=622718" title="Communist League (Canada)">
<text>The Communist League in Canada was founded as the &quot;Revolutionary Workers League/Ligue Ouvrière Révolutionnaire&quot; (RWL) in 1977 as the result of a merger of the League for Socialist Action (LSA), the Revolutionary Marxist Group (RMG) and the Groupe Marxiste Revolutionaire.

Originally a Trotskyist party, the RWL was the Canadian section of the Fourth International (FI). The group followed the US Socialist Workers Party&#x27;s (SWP) trajectory away from Trotskyism in favour of a view of Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba as the vanguard of world revolution. The RWL purged members who did not support the new orientation, many of whom went on to form Socialist Challenge and Gauche Socialiste.

In 1990, the RWL left the FI to become part of the new Pathfinder tendency spearheaded by the SWP and changed its name to the Communist League. The new group ceased publication of the English &quot;Socialist Voice&quot; in favour of selling &quot;The Militant&quot;, published in New York City by the SWP.

Michel Prairie is the group&#x27;s general secretary and primary spokesperson, succeeding Steve Penner in the early 1990s.

In early 2004, John Riddell, the RWL&#x27;s former national secretary, his partner Suzanne Weiss, and Roger Annis left the CL over a dispute regarding protests against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and started &quot;Socialist Voice&quot;, taking the name of the RWL&#x27;s old newspaper.

The CL operates a Pathfinder Bookstore in Montreal. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the RWL and then the CL had branches in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Branches and bookstores in Toronto and Vancouver were closed by 2008, with CL members from those locations relocated to Montreal to consolidate the organization there.

==Candidates for public office==

The Communist League has run candidates in some federal, provincial and municipal elections in Canada, most notably in Ontario and Quebec.

As the Communist League has not registered as a political party with Elections Canada, their candidates are listed as &quot;non-affiliated&quot; on the ballot.

<text>The Battle of Blue Licks, fought on August 19, 1782, was one of the last battles of the American Revolutionary War. The battle occurred ten months after Lord Cornwallis&#x27;s surrender at Yorktown, which had effectively ended the war in the east. On a hill next to the Licking River in what is now Robertson County, Kentucky (then Fayette County, Virginia), a force of about 50 Loyalists along with 300 Indian warriors ambushed and routed 182 Kentucky militiamen, who were partially led by Daniel Boone, the famed frontiersman. It was the last victory for the Loyalists and natives during the frontier war. British, Loyalist and Native forces would engage in fighting with American forces once more the following month in Wheeling, West Virginia, during the Siege of Fort Henry.

==Background==

===Caldwell&#x27;s expedition===
Although the main British Army under Lord Cornwallis had surrendered at Yorktown in October 1781, virtually ending the war in the east, fighting on the western frontier continued. Aided by the British garrison at Fort Detroit, Indians north of the Ohio River redoubled their efforts to drive the American settlers out of the western frontier of Kentucky County, Virginia.

In July 1782 a meeting took place at the Shawnee villages near the headwaters of the Mad River in the Ohio Country, with Shawnee, Mingo, Wyandot, Miami, Odawa, Ojibwe and Potawatomi tribals in attendance. As a result, 150 men from the Loyalist Butler&#x27;s Rangers unit under the command of Captain William Caldwell and approximately 1,100 Indian warriors led by British Indian Department officials Alexander McKee, Simon Girty, and Matthew Elliott set out to attack Wheeling, on the upper Ohio River. This was one of the largest forces sent against American settlements during the war.

The expedition was called off, however, when scouts reported that a force under George Rogers Clark, whom the Indians feared more than any other commander, was about to invade the Ohio Country from Kentucky. Caldwell&#x27;s army returned to the Mad River to oppose the invasion, but the attack never came. In fact, Clark did have a large armed boat patrolling the Ohio River, but he had no plans to invade. Most of the Indigenous warriors returned to their homes.

===Bryan Station===
Caldwell and about 50 Loyalists, supported by 300 Indians, crossed the Ohio River into Kentucky. They meant to surprise and destroy the settlement of Bryan Station, but the settlers discovered them and took shelter within their stockade. Caldwell and McKee&#x27;s force laid siege to Bryan Station on August 15, killing all of the settlers&#x27; livestock and destroying their crops, but withdrew after two days when they learned that Kentucky militiamen were on the way. Five Indians were killed and two wounded during this short siege.
The militia arrived at Bryan Station on August 18. The force included about 47 men from Fayette County and another 135 from Lincoln County. The highest-ranking officer, Colonel John Todd of Fayette County, was in overall command, assisted by Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Boone. Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Trigg and Major Hugh McGary led the Lincoln County contingent. Benjamin Logan, colonel of the Lincoln militia, was gathering men and had not yet arrived.

The militiamen could pursue the raiders immediately, to keep them from escaping, or they could wait for Logan to arrive with reinforcements. Boone advised waiting for Logan, who was only a day away, but others urged immediate action, pointing out that the enemy force had a 40-mile (60 km) lead on them. Boone felt compelled to go along, so the Kentuckians set out on horseback over an old buffalo trail before making camp at sunset.

==Battle==
On the morning of August 19, the Kentuckians reached the Licking River, near a spring and salt lick known as the Lower Blue Licks (today within Nicholas County). A few Indian scouts were seen watching them from across the river. Behind the scouts was a hill around which the river looped. Todd called a council and asked Daniel Boone, the most experienced woodsman, what he thought. Boone said he had been growing increasingly suspicious because of the obvious trail the Indians left. He felt the Indians were trying to lead them into an ambush.

Hugh McGary, known as both a fierce Indian fighter and an unstable hothead, urged immediate attack. When no one listened, he mounted his horse and rode across the ford, calling out, &quot;Them that ain&#x27;t cowards, follow me.&quot; The men immediately followed McGary, as did the officers, who hoped to restore order. Boone remarked, &quot;We are all slaughtered men,&quot; and crossed the river.

Most of the men dismounted and formed a line of battle several rows deep. They advanced up the hill, Todd and McGary in the center, Trigg on the right, Boone on the left. As Boone had suspected, Caldwell&#x27;s force was waiting on the other side, concealed in ravines. When the Kentuckians reached the summit, the Indians opened fire at close range with devastating accuracy. After only five minutes, the center and right of the Kentuckians&#x27; line fell back. Only Boone&#x27;s men on the left managed to push forward. Todd and Trigg, easy targets on horseback, were shot dead.

The Kentuckians began to flee down the hill, fighting hand-to-hand with Indians who had flanked them. McGary rode up to Boone&#x27;s company and told him everyone was retreating and that Boone was now surrounded. Boone ordered his men to retreat. He grabbed a riderless horse and ordered his 23-year-old son, Israel Boone, to mount it. Israel suddenly fell to the ground, shot through the neck. Boone realized his son was dead, mounted the horse and joined in the retreat. Caldwell had lost seven killed and ten wounded during ambush.

Silas Harlan died in this battle.

==Aftermath==
Although he had not taken part in the battle, George Rogers Clark, as senior commander, was widely condemned in Kentucky for allowing the Loyalist-Indian force to cross the river and court disaster at Blue Licks. In response, Clark launched a retaliatory raid across the Ohio River in November. His force consisted of more than 1,000 men, including Benjamin Logan and Daniel Boone. The Kentuckians destroyed five unoccupied Shawnee villages on the Great Miami River in the last major offensive of the American Revolution. No battles took place, since the Shawnees refused to stand and fell back to their villages on the Mad River. In a November 27, 1782 letter Clark reported the Indians had 10 killed; 7 captured and 2 whites retaken. His own loses were 1 killed and 1 wounded

Four years later, the Indian villages on the Mad River would be destroyed by Logan at the outset of the Northwest Indian War. McGary confronted the Shawnee chief Moluntha and asked if he had been at Blue Licks. Moluntha nodded his head in agreement, and McGary killed him with a tomahawk. Moluntha had voluntarily and peacefully surrendered and waved an American flag and a copy of the peace treaty he had signed earlier that year in the belief that they would protect him. Logan immediately relieved McGary of his command and ordered him court-martialed for killing a prisoner. McGary was stripped of his commission for a year but otherwise went unpunished.

==Legacy==
The Blue Licks battle site is commemorated at Blue Licks Battlefield State Park, on U.S. Route 68 between Paris and Maysville, just outside the town of Blue Licks Springs. The site includes a granite obelisk, burial grounds, The Worthington Lodge, Hidden Waters Restaurant, a gift shop and a museum. Every August, on the weekend closest to the 19th, a re-enactment and memorial service is held.

<text>United Seychelles is a political party in Seychelles. It publishes a newspaper called &quot;The People&quot;. It was known as the Seychelles People&#x27;s Progressive Front () from 1978/9 to June 2009, when it changed its name to the People&#x27;s Party (Seychellois Creole: , PL). The party changed its name again in November 2018, from the People&#x27;s Party to United Seychelles.

The party was founded in 1964 by France-Albert René, under the name Seychelles People&#x27;s United Party, and it was led by him from its inception. The party was the ruling party from 1977 to 2020 and was the sole legal party in the country from 1979 to 1991 (this period is referred to retrospectively as the &quot;Second Republic&quot;). The party is led by a Central Executive Committee.

Leading members of the party over the years have been René, James Michel (formerly the chief of staff of the armed forces, information minister, finance minister and vice president from 1996 to 2004; he was the President of Seychelles from 2004 to 2016), Guy Sinon, Jacques Hodoul (a former foreign minister who was regarded as the party&#x27;s chief ideologue), Joseph Belmont (former Vice president of Seychelles), and Maxime Ferrari (a former René loyalist who later supported the opposition and wrote an autobiography).

Former Vice president of Seychelles Vincent Meriton has been the leader of the party since June 2017 (party president). He is the third president of the party since its creation in 1964. Meriton was preceded by former President of Seychelles James Michel.

During the era of one-party rule, the party was funded by dues paid by its members and from foreign governments including Tanzania, Algeria, Libya and East Germany.

The party maintains branches in each electoral district and utilizes an extensive system of patronage. At the parliamentary election in 2011, the party won 88.56% of the popular vote and all 31 seats in the National Assembly. That fell to 49.22% and 14 seats in the national assembly after the parliamentary election in 2016, leaving the party in parliamentary opposition for the first time.
From 1993 (when opposition parties were legalised) to 2011, candidates from the party won all the presidential elections in the first round, while in 2016 they won in the second round, and in 2020 they lost for the first time. The party also held a majority in the National Assembly independence until 2016. Seychelles opposition candidate Wavel Ramkalawan won in the 2020 Seychellois general election with 54.9 percent of valid votes cast, upsetting incumbent President Danny Faure of United Seychelles. The party lost its first presidential poll in over 40 years since Seychelles gained independence. United Seychellois lost also in the General Assembly elections and Linyon Demokratik Seselwa (LDS) held its clear majority in the parliament.

After Vincent Meriton stepped down as party leader, Patrick Herminie was elected as the new leader in 2021. In October 2023, Herminie was charged by the Seychellois public prosecutor with witchcraft. He denied the charges and described them as politically motivated. In February 2024, the witchcraft accusations were lifted by the Victoria public prosecutor&#x27;s office.

<text>The Seychelles National Party (SNP) is a liberal political party in Seychelles. Its followers emphasize active multiparty democracy, respect for human rights and liberal economic reforms. It was founded in response to what it called the &quot;totalitarian regime&quot; of former President France-Albert René. It publishes a newsletter called &quot;Regar&quot;, which is frequently sued for libel by government officials. On &quot;Regar&#x27;s&quot; front page of every issue is a quote from the constitution of Seychelles invoking their right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression.

The SNP was formed by the merger of three separate opposition parties in 1994: the Seychelles National Movement, led by Gérard Hoarau; the National Alliance Party, led by Philippe Boullé (an independent presidential candidate in the 2001 presidential election); and Parti Seselwa, led by Wavel Ramkalawan.

Ramkalawan, an Anglican priest, is the SNP&#x27;s current leader. He won 44.9% of the vote in the 2001 presidential election, behind René (54.2%) and ahead of Boullé (0.9%). At parliamentary elections in December 2002, the SNP won 42.6% of the vote and 11 seats out of 34. Seven members were directly elected and four were chosen by proportional representation.

The July/August 2006 presidential elections gave James Michel of the SPPF 54% of the votes and Wavel Ramkalawan 46% of the votes. The last Presidential elections held in December 2015 saw SNP achieving only 35% of the popular votes in the first round. It joined with other smaller political parties under the banner of Union for Change to contest the second round of the Presidential Elections. The Union achieved 49.85% of the popular votes leaving the incumbent President James Michel to claim a slim victory.

The election of the National Assembly was held on the 22–24 October 2020. The Seychelles National Party, the Seychelles Party for Social Justice and Democracy and the Seychelles United Party formed a coalition, Linyon Demokratik Seselwa (LDS). LDS won 25 seats and US got 10 seats of the 35 seats of the National Assembly. In the simultaneous presidential election Wavel Ramkalawan won and he was the first president since 1977 who did not represent the long-term ruling party.

<text>The Seychelles Democratic Party is a political party in Seychelles. It was founded by the late Sir James Mancham and David Joubert in July 1964, and governed the country from 1970 to 1977.

==History==
After a time in exile in the United Kingdom, Mancham returned to the islands following the Seychelles&#x27; transition to democracy in 1993. He had led the SDP from the time of its founding. At the last elections of 6 December 2002 the party won 3.1% of the vote and failed to gain representation in the National Assembly. In February 2005 Mancham stepped down with Nichol Gabriel assuming the leadership of the party. In March 2006 Paul Chow was elected as party leader in a vote held by the executives of the party.

<doc id="622738" wikidata="Q2917090" url="?curid=622738" title="Canadian pale">
<text>In heraldry and vexillology, a Canadian pale is a centre band of a vertical triband flag (a pale in heraldry) that covers half the length of a flag, rather than a third as in most triband designs. This allows more space to display a central image (common charge). The name was suggested by Sir Conrad Swan, Rouge Dragon Pursuivant (a heraldic office in Britain), and first used by Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Canada proclaiming the new Canadian flag on 28 January 1965.

The classic Canadian pale is a square central panel occupying half of a flag with 1:2 proportions. However, vexillological usage applies it to any central band that is half the width of the flag, even if this renders it non-square. The term Canadian pale is also used for flags which do not originate in Canada. The 3:5 Flag of Mississippi and proposed flag of Taiwan and the 7:11 flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are all described as having a Canadian pale.

The Canadian pale is a popular feature of sub-national, civic and personal heraldry from Canada developed after 1965. A few examples can be found in the flag of Yukon, the flag of the city of Edmonton, Alberta, the arms of Athabaska University, and in the arms of numerous individual recipients.

The term is sometimes used in an even looser sense to refer to any flag with a larger central panel, irrespective of whether or not it covers half the flag. By this looser description, the flag of Norfolk Island (stripes in a ratio of 7:9:7) and the flag of Iowa (ratio legally undefined, but usually the central stripe is less than twice that of the outer stripes) are sometimes considered to have a Canadian pale.

By analogy, any flag which has a central &quot;horizontal&quot; stripe that is half the height of the flag is sometimes said to have a Spanish fess.

==Heraldry==

In coats of arms, and heraldry in general, a &#x27;Canadian pale&#x27; is what might well be referred to in South African heraldry as a &#x27;broad pale&#x27; as its width is half that of the shield on which it is shown as opposed to the ordinary pale&#x27;s third to a quarter. They are most commonly used in Canadian heraldry.

<doc id="622746" wikidata="Q767253" url="?curid=622746" title="Columbian exchange">
<text>The Columbian exchange, also known as the Columbian interchange, was the widespread transfer of plants, animals, and diseases between the New World (the Americas) in the Western Hemisphere, and the Old World (Afro-Eurasia) in the Eastern Hemisphere, from the late 15th century on. It is named after the explorer Christopher Columbus and is related to the European colonization and global trade following his 1492 voyage. Some of the exchanges were deliberate while others were unintended. Communicable diseases of Old World origin resulted in an 80 to 95 percent reduction in the indigenous population of the Americas from the 15th century onwards, and their extinction in the Caribbean.

The cultures of both hemispheres were significantly impacted by the migration of people, both free and enslaved, from the Old World to the New. European colonists and African slaves replaced indigenous populations across the Americas, to varying degrees. The number of Africans taken to the New World was far greater than the number of Europeans moving there in the first three centuries after Columbus.

The new contacts among the global population resulted in the interchange of many species of crops and livestock, which supported increases in food production and population in the Old World. American crops such as maize, potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, cassava, sweet potatoes, and chili peppers became important crops around the world. Old World rice, wheat, sugar cane, and livestock, among other crops, became important in the New World. 

The term was first used in 1972 by the American historian and professor Alfred W. Crosby in his environmental history book &quot;The Columbian Exchange&quot;. It was rapidly adopted by other historians and by journalists.

== Etymology ==


In 1972, Alfred W. Crosby, an American historian at the University of Texas at Austin, published the book &quot;The Columbian Exchange&quot;, thus coining the term. His primary focus was mapping the biological and cultural transfers that occurred between the Old and New Worlds. He studied the effects of Columbus&#x27;s voyages between the two – specifically, the global diffusion of crops, seeds, and plants from the New World to the Old, which radically transformed agriculture in both regions.

His research made a lasting contribution to the way scholars understand the variety of contemporary ecosystems that arose due to these transfers. His 1986 book &quot;Ecological Imperialism&quot; presented further research in the field.

== Background ==

The scientific consensus is that humans first came to the New World from Siberia thousands of years ago. There is little additional evidence of contacts between the peoples of the Old World and those of the New World, although the literature speculating on pre-Columbian trans-oceanic journeys is extensive. The first inhabitants of the New World brought with them small domestic dogs and, possibly, a container, the calabash, both of which persisted in their new home. The medieval explorations, visits, and brief residence of the Norsemen in Greenland, Newfoundland, and Vinland in the late 10th century and 11th century had no known impact on the Americas, though the small perennial &quot;Rumex acetosella&quot; (sheep&#x27;s sorrel) appeared in Greenland at that time.

Many scientists accept that possible contact between Polynesians and coastal peoples in South America around the year 1200 resulted in genetic similarities and the adoption by Polynesians of an American crop, the sweet potato. However, it was only with the first voyage of the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus and his crew to the Americas in 1492 that the Columbian exchange began, resulting in major transformations in the cultures and livelihoods of the peoples in both hemispheres.

== Biological exchanges ==

=== Of plants === 

Because of the new trading resulting from the Columbian exchange, several plants native to the Americas spread around the world, including potatoes, maize, tomatoes, and tobacco. Before 1500, potatoes were not grown outside of South America. By the 18th century, they were cultivated and consumed widely in Europe and had become important crops in both India and North America. Potatoes eventually became an important staple food in the diets of many Europeans, contributing to an estimated 12 to 25% of the population growth in Afro-Eurasia between 1700 and 1900. The introduction of the potato to the Old World accounts for 47 percent of the increase in urbanization between 1700 and 1900. Cassava was introduced from South America by the Portuguese in the 16th century, and gradually replaced sorghum and millet as Africa&#x27;s most important food crop. Spanish colonizers of the 16th century introduced new staple crops to Asia from the Americas, including maize and sweet potatoes, contributing to population growth there. On a larger scale, the introduction of potatoes and maize to the Old World improved people&#x27;s nutrition throughout the Eurasian landmass, enabling more varied and abundant food production. Cassava and maize can have negative consequences when overused (for example, the nutritional diseases pellagra and konzo).

The discovery of the Americas provided the Old World with new arable landscapes suitable for growing sugarcane and coffee. Coffee, introduced in the Americas circa 1720 from Africa and the Middle East, and sugarcane, introduced from the Indian subcontinent to the Spanish West Indies, subsequently became the primary commodity crops and exported goods of extensive Latin American plantations. Introduced to India by the Portuguese, chili peppers and potatoes from South America in turn became integral parts of Indian cuisine, and starting the process of making curry an international dish. 

Because crops traveled widely but at least initially their endemic fungi did not, for a limited time yields were somewhat higher in the new regions to which they were introduced, a form of ecological release or &quot;&quot;. However, the exchange of pathogens has continued alongside globalization, and crops have declined back toward their endemic yields. 

The Spanish were the first Europeans to grow cacao, in 1590. Though cacao was usually consumed by European populations in the form of sweets and was at first treated as an expensive luxury item, chocolate helped with fatigue and provided energy. As for vanilla, the pods of the plant after chemical treatment acquired an aroma, which was then used both in cooking and in perfumery.

Rice, originally domesticated in China, became widely planted in the New World; European planters there relied upon the skills of African slaves to cultivate it. Georgia, South Carolina, Cuba, and Puerto Rico were major centers of rice production during the colonial era. Enslaved Africans brought their knowledge of water control, milling, winnowing, and other agrarian practices to the fields. This widespread knowledge among African slaves eventually made rice a staple food in the New World.

Citrus fruits and grapes were brought to the Americas from the Mediterranean. At first planters struggled to adapt these crops to New World climates, but by the late 19th century they were cultivated more consistently. Bananas were introduced into the Americas in the 16th century by Portuguese sailors, who brought them from West Africa. Despite this early introduction, they were little consumed in the Americas as late as the 1880s, when large plantations were established in the Caribbean. The Manila galleon trading network introduced American plants such as chayote and papaya into Southeast Asia; these were incorporated into the cuisines there.

Long before the arrival of the Spaniards, cultivators brought wild tomatoes from Central America to South America. Soon after Columbus&#x27;s visit, tomatoes were brought to Spain, and from there to other European countries, including Italy. In 1544, Pietro Andrea Mattioli, a Tuscan physician and botanist, wrote that the tomato was eaten fried in oil there. The first Italian cookbook to include tomato sauce, &quot;Lo Scalco alla Moderna&quot; (&quot;The Modern Steward&quot;), was written by Italian chef Antonio Latini and was published in two volumes in 1692 and 1694. In 1790, the use of tomato sauce with pasta appeared for the first time, in the Italian cookbook &quot;L&#x27;Apicio Moderno&quot; (&quot;The Modern Apicius&quot;), by chef Francesco Leonardi. 

Alongside the intentional introductions of cultivated plants that were Crosby&#x27;s focus, many wild plants including weeds of cultivation, such as dandelions and grasses, were transferred in both directions, permanently affecting the ecology of many parts of the world.

=== Of animals ===

Initially, the Columbian exchange of animals largely went in one direction, from Europe to the New World, as the Eurasian regions had domesticated many more animals. Horses, donkeys, mules, pigs, cattle, sheep, goats, chickens, dogs, cats, and bees were rapidly adopted by native peoples for transport, food, and other uses. The Plains Indians, for example, made extensive use of horses for hunting. 

While mesoamerican peoples, Mayas in particular, already practiced apiculture, producing wax and honey from a variety of bees, such as &quot;Melipona&quot; or &quot;Trigona&quot;, European bees (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;)—were more productive, delivering a honey with less water content and allowing for easier extraction from beehives—were introduced in New Spain, becoming an important part of farming production.

The Mapuche of Araucanía were fast to adopt the horse from the Spanish, and improve their military capabilities as they fought the Arauco War against Spanish colonizers. Until the arrival of the Spanish, the Mapuches had largely maintained chilihueques (llamas) as livestock. The Spanish introduction of sheep caused some competition between the two domesticated species. Anecdotal evidence of the mid-17th century shows that by then sheep far outnumbered llamas. The decline of llamas reached a point in the late 18th century when only the Mapuche from Mariquina and the Huequén next to Angol raised the species. In the Chiloé Archipelago the introduction of pigs by the Spanish proved a success. They could feed on the abundant shellfish and algae exposed by the large tides.

In the other direction, the turkey, from North America, and the Muscovy duck, from Mexico and South America, were New World domestic animals transferred to Europe.

=== Of diseases === 

The first manifestation of the Columbian exchange may have been the spread of syphilis from the native people of the Caribbean Sea to Europe. The history of syphilis has been well-studied, but the origin of the disease remains a subject of debate. There are two primary hypotheses: one proposes that syphilis was carried to Europe from the Americas by the crew of Christopher Columbus in the early 1490s, while the other proposes that syphilis previously existed in Europe but went unrecognized. The first written descriptions of syphilis in the Old World came in 1493. The first large outbreak of syphilis in Europe occurred in 1494–1495 among the army of Charles VIII during its invasion of Naples. Many of the crew members who had served with Columbus had joined this army. After the victory, Charles&#x27;s largely mercenary army returned to their respective homes, spreading &quot;the Great Pox&quot; across Europe, which killed up to five million people.

The Columbian exchange of diseases towards the New World was far deadlier. The peoples of the Americas had previously had no exposure to Old World diseases and little or no immunity to them. An epidemic of swine influenza beginning in 1493 killed many of the Taino people inhabiting Caribbean islands. The pre-contact population of the island of Hispaniola was probably at least 500,000, but by 1526, fewer than 500 were still alive. Spanish exploitation was part of the cause of the near-extinction of the native people.

In 1518, smallpox was first recorded in the Americas and became the deadliest imported Old World disease. Forty percent of the 200,000 people living in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, later Mexico City, are estimated to have died of smallpox in 1520 during the war of the Aztecs with conquistador Hernán Cortés. Epidemics, possibly of smallpox, spread from Central America, devastated the population of the Inca Empire a few years before the arrival of the Spanish. The ravages of Old World diseases and Spanish exploitation reduced the Mexican population from an estimated 20 million to barely more than a million in the 16th century. 

The indigenous population of Peru decreased from about 9 million in the pre-Columbian era, to 600,000 in 1620. An estimated 80–95 percent of the Native American population died in epidemics within the first 100–150 years following 1492. Nunn and Qian also refer to the calculations of the scientist David Cook: in some cases no one survived due to diseases. The deadliest Old World diseases in the Americas were smallpox, measles, whooping cough, chicken pox, bubonic plague, typhus, and malaria. Yellow fever was brought to the Americas from Africa, probably by the slave trade. Many people in Africa had acquired immunity. Europeans suffered higher rates of death than did people of African descent when exposed to yellow fever in the Americas, as numerous epidemics swept the colonies and sugar plantations.

On the other hand, European exploration of tropical areas was aided by the New World discovery of quinine, the first effective treatment for malaria. Cinchona trees from the Andes were processed and quinine was obtained from their bark. Europeans suffered from this disease, but some indigenous populations had developed at least partial resistance to it. In Africa, resistance to malaria has been associated with other genetic changes among sub-Saharan Africans and their descendants, which can cause sickle-cell disease. The resistance of sub-Saharan Africans to malaria in the southern United States and the Caribbean contributed greatly to the specific character of the Africa-sourced slavery in those regions.

== Cultural exchanges == 

=== Clash of cultures ===

The movement of people between New and Old Worlds caused cultural exchanges, extending to what Pieter Emmer has called &quot;a clash of cultures&quot;. This involved the transfer of European values to indigenous cultures, such as the concept of private property in regions where property was often viewed as communal, universal monogamy (though many indigenous peoples were already monogamous), the role of women and children in the social system, and different concepts of labor, including slavery. Christianity was brought to the indigenous peoples by priests and monks from Europe. Tobacco was used in the Old World as medicine and currency, while in the New World, it was the subject of religious customs. Some New World peoples such as the Mapuche of Araucania resisted the adoption of Spanish technology, holding to their ancestral customs. Indigenous people have often been seen as static recipients of transatlantic encounters, but thousands of Native Americans crossed the ocean during the sixteenth century, some by choice.

=== Atlantic slave trade ===

The Atlantic slave trade consisted of the involuntary immigration of 11.7 million Africans, primarily from West Africa, to the Americas between the 16th and 19th centuries, far outnumbering the about 3.4 million Europeans who migrated, most voluntarily, to the New World between 1492 and 1840. The prevalence of African slaves in the New World was related to the demographic decline of New World peoples and the need of European colonists for labor. Another reason for the demand for slaves was the cultivation of crops such as sugar cane suitable for the climatic conditions of the new lands. The Africans were less likely to die, too, from those diseases that had been brought to the New World. Enslaved Africans helped shape an emerging African-American culture in the New World. They participated in both skilled and unskilled labor. For example, slaves were involved in handicraft production. They could also work as ordinary workers, and as managers of small enterprises in the commercial or industrial sphere. Their descendants gradually developed an ethnicity that drew from the numerous African tribes as well as European nationalities. The descendants of African slaves make up a majority of the population in some Caribbean countries, notably Haiti and Jamaica, and a sizeable minority in most American countries.

<doc id="622748" wikidata="Q271060" url="?curid=622748" title="Datong District, Taipei">
<text>Datong District or Tatung is a district of Taipei City, Taiwan. It is located between the Taipei Metro Red Line and eastern shore of the Tamsui River, and between Civic Boulevard and the Sun Yat-sen Freeway. The southern part of this district is known as Twatutia, one of the first settlements in what is now Taipei and once the commercial center. Taipei&#x27;s commercial center has since shifted southeast to Zhongzheng, Da&#x27;an and Xinyi, and Datong is far less important economically. Some of the last vestiges of Twatutia&#x27;s commercial importance is preserved on Dihua Street. The old town of Daronpon is in the northern part of the district.


==History==
During the Qing Dynasty, the district was named &quot;Daronpon&quot; (), &quot;Paronpon&quot;, and other variants, but was renamed &quot;Toaliongtong&quot; () in 1844. Following the Second Opium War, a port was opened in Twatutia for international trade. Foreign trade resulted in the economic development of the district.

In 1946, the district&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Tatung&quot; (), which means &quot;Great Unity&quot;, the Confucian notion of utopia which is in the lyrics of the National Anthem of the Republic of China. In 1990, the district merged with neighboring Jiancheng and Yanping Districts to create today&#x27;s enlarged Datong District. The spelling became &quot;Datong&quot; due to switching to the Pinyin Chinese romanization system.

==Administrative divisions==
The district consists of Bao&#x27;an, Dayou, Guangneng, Guoqing, Guoshun, Jiangong, Jianming, Jiantai, Jingxing, Laoshi, Linjiang, Longhe, Minquan, Nanfang, Penglai, Shuanglian, Siwen, Xingming, Yangya, Yanping, Yongle, Yuquan, Zhaoyang, Zhisheng and Zhongqing urban villages.

<text>The Front for Democracy in Burundi (, FRODEBU) is a political party in Burundi.

== History ==
It was formed by followers of Melchior Ndadaye from the disbanded Burundi Workers&#x27; Party in 1986. FRODEBU was legalized as a political party in 1992.

In 1993, FRODEBU won power in Burundi and put forward a Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye. The election of a Hutu government triggered violence between Hutu and Tutsi militias, and President Ndadaye was assassinated. In retaliation, some 25,000 Tutsis were killed. The Tutsis responded with an outbreak of violence against Hutus and killed civilians in retaliation. The violence was on a smaller scale than the mass genocide occurring in Rwanda where Hutu were massacring Tutsis and moderate Hutus.

By mid-1994, FRODEBU had been severely crippled by a loss of leadership; of its 11-strong central committee prior to the 1993 elections, by that point only Sylvestre Ntibantunganya remained active with the party in Burundi. Six of the committee members had been killed, while the remainder had fled into exile.

In the legislative 2005 parliamentary election, the party won 21.7% of the vote and 30 out of 118 seats, becoming the main opposition party.

FRODEBU suspended its participation in the National Assembly on 21 February 2008 to protest efforts by the National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD/FDD) to remove Alice Nzomukunda, a former CNDD/FDD member, from her post as vice-president of the National Assembly.

FRODEBU is a consultative member of the Socialist International.

<text>The GD Graphics Library is a graphics software library for dynamically manipulating images. It can create GIFs, JPEGs, PNGs, and WBMPs. The images can be composed of lines, arcs, text (using program-selected fonts), other images, and multiple colors, supporting truecolor images, alpha channels, resampling, and many other features.

== History ==

The software was developed in 1994 by Thomas Boutell and others.

GD originally stood for &quot;GIF Draw&quot;. However, since the revoking of the Unisys license, it has informally stood for &quot;Graphics Draw&quot;.

Support for drawing GIFs was dropped in 1999 when Unisys revoked the royalty-free license granted to non-commercial software projects for the LZW compression method used by GIFs. When the Unisys patent expired worldwide on July 7, 2004, GIF support was subsequently re-enabled.

Version 2.0 added support for truecolor images, alpha channels, resampling (for smooth resizing of truecolor images), and many other features.

== Features ==

The &quot;Fly&quot; command line interpreter allows for image creation (&quot;on the fly&quot;) using GD. GD scripts can thus be written in potentially any language and run using this tool.

Its native programming language is ANSI C, but it has interfaces for many other programming languages. GD supports numerous programming languages including C, PHP, Perl, Python, OCaml, Tcl, Lua, Pascal, GNU Octave, Rexx, Ruby and Go. GD is extensively used with PHP, where a modified version supporting additional features is included by default as of PHP 4.3 and was an option before that. As of PHP 5.3, a system version of GD may be used as well, to get the additional features that were previously available only to the bundled version of GD.

<doc id="622756" wikidata="Q426674" url="?curid=622756" title="Temporary file">
<text>A temporary file is a file created to store information temporarily, either for a program&#x27;s intermediate use or for transfer to a permanent file when complete. It may be created by computer programs for a variety of purposes, such as when a program cannot allocate enough memory for its tasks, when the program is working on data bigger than the architecture&#x27;s address space, or as a primitive form of inter-process communication.

== Auxiliary memory ==
Modern operating systems employ virtual memory, however programs that use large amounts of data (e.g. [[Video editing software|video #) may need to create temporary file(s).

== Inter-process communication ==
Most operating systems offer primitives such as [[Pipeline (software)|pipes]], [[Internet socket|sockets]] or [[Shared memory (interprocess communication)|shared memory]] to pass data among programs, but often the simplest way (especially for programs that follow the [[Unix philosophy]]) is to write data into a temporary file and inform the receiving program of the location of the temporary file.

== Creation ==
Operating systems and programming languages typically provide functions for obtaining unique temporary file names.

On [[POSIX]] systems, temporary files can be safely created with the codice_1 or library functions. Some systems provide the former [[POSIX]] (now removed) program. These files are typically located in the standard temporary directory, /tmp on Unix machines or %TEMP% (which is log-in specific) on Windows machines.

A temporary file created with is deleted automatically when the program exits or the file is closed. To generate a temporary file name that will survive past the lifespan of the creating program, (POSIX) or codice_2 (Windows) can be used.

== Issues ==
Some programs create temporary files and then leave them behind - they do not delete them. This can happen because the program [[crash (computing)|crashed]] or the developer of the program simply forgot to add the code needed to delete the temporary files after the program is done with them. The temporary files left behind can accumulate over time and consume a lot of disk space.

Temporary files may be deleted manually. Operating systems may clear out the temporary directory on a reboot, and they may have &quot;cleaner&quot; scripts that remove files if they have not been accessed in a certain amount of time. Also, memory-based filesystems, such as [[tmpfs]], inherently do not preserve files across a reboot.

<text>CNNNN (&quot;Chaser NoN-stop News Network&quot;) is a Logie Award winning Australian television program, satirising American news channels CNN and Fox News. It was produced and hosted by comedy team The Chaser.

&quot;CNNNN&quot;&#x27;s slogan was &quot;We Report, You Believe.&quot;, a parody of Fox News&#x27; slogan &quot;We Report, You Decide.&quot;

In April 2004, &quot;CNNNN&quot; won a Logie Award for Most Outstanding Comedy Program, an award that was shared with &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;.

==Overview==
The program was presented as a &quot;live&quot; feed from a fictional 24-hour news channel, anchored by Craig Reucassel and Chris Taylor. Each episode had a theme which carried through the episode, examples (from the DVD) included:

*Lunchgate: A businessman accidentally leaves his lunch at home and is pursued by police and the media in an O. J. Simpson style chase and becomes a suspected terrorist.
*Cadman for PM: &quot;CNNNN&quot; beats up a comment by minor Australian politician Alan Cadman as a leadership challenge against Prime Minister John Howard.
*Shush For Bush: US President George W. Bush is visiting Australia for 20 hours, and is believed to want to sleep the entire visit. &quot;CNNNN&quot; exhorts Australia to be quiet so the President can sleep properly.
*Animal Farm: The Chaser &quot;reality show&quot; &quot;Animal Farm&quot; is a send-up of &quot;Big Brother&quot;. &quot;CNNNN&quot; covers the controversy when one of the contestants dies, but is not removed from the house.
*Packer Health Crisis: Live updates on the health of Australian businessman Kerry Packer.
*Tilt Australia: &quot;CNNNN&quot; aims to reduce the water-shortage crisis in inland Australia by tilting the entire continent to drain the water from the Eastern seaboard. Radio announcer Alan Jones was duped by the Chaser team live on air for believing this concept.

==Episodes==
===Season 1 ===
===Season 2 ===
==Cast members==
The roles of other members of the Chaser team included:
* Charles Firth: played a hard-hitting reporter with highly-controversial opinions presented in segments called &quot;The Firth Factor&quot;, &quot;The Firth Report&quot; and &quot;Firth and Friends&quot; in which he abuses his guests, doing such things as gagging them and yelling in their face. The character could be interpreted as a parody of Bill O&#x27;Reilly, who hosts a program on Fox News Channel called the O&#x27;Reilly Factor, as well as Fox and Friends. An example of his hard hitting style, &quot;100% of kids who smoke and have their brain removed, end up DEAD!&quot;
* Andrew Hansen: the leader of the &quot;CNNNN&quot; &quot;newsband&quot;, which would play musical commentary for some stories, and occasionally lyrically interact with the other members of the cast as if actually talking to them. He was also Rudi J Blass, the director of Newstainment, who would create game shows and entertainment pieces based around big news stories: &quot;They say comedy equals tragedy plus time, well I say game show equals tragedy plus now&#x27;.&quot; Rudi J Blass often appeared in a studio very similar to that of Larry King Live and would commentate on news stories. Hansen was also Simon Target, a reporter with a thick English accent. In season one, the show started at the end of one of Simon Target&#x27;s reports.
* Julian Morrow: &quot;CNNNN&quot;&#x27;s US correspondent. Morrow would appear on a television as if he were overseas, although he did actually conduct a number of vox pops in the US to highlight American ignorance of Australia, other countries and international affairs in general. He would, amusingly, still speak about stories with no relevance to the US and sit as if he were actually on the news desk, and when the anchors would look at the screen on the other side of the room at other out-of-studio guests, Julian Morrow would do the same. In one episode he actually comes out of the television into the studio after Chris Taylor turns the screen he appears on off.
* Chas Licciardello: hosted &quot;Lameass&quot;, a parody of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Jackass&quot;, with intentionally bad stunts. He also appeared as &quot;Mongoose&quot; in the Sky Chaser 8 news helicopter, as the producer of a new game show (allegedly meant to be &quot;The Block&quot; as a musical) and as a reporter of his own name, occasionally. In the first season, he was CNNNN&#x27;s Brussels correspondent and whenever the anchors would cross to Brussels, a &quot;technical problem&quot;, like Chas having a python wrapped around him or his severed head on the desk in front of him, would cut Chas off before he could even say anything, leading Reucassel to say, &quot;Sorry, we seem to have a technical problem there in Brussels.&quot;
* Dominic Knight: former weatherman, now a reporter.
* Anna Skellern: correspondent.

==Regular features==
Other regular features of the program included:
* A newsbar, which proved so popular it was made available on the CNNNN website.
* Market Research conducted by Julian Morrow in the United States, in which he asks civilians questions on topics such as which country America should invade next, and prompts the civilians to choose their answer from exclusively right-wing multiple choice options.

==Legacy==
A DVD containing five of the episodes from the 2003 series of &quot;CNNNN&quot; (Lunchgate, Cadman for PM, Shush for Bush, Animal Farm, and Packer Health Crisis), as well as highlights from the fake advertising breaks, was released in November 2004.

In September 2005, Chaser News Alert started running on the ABC&#x27;s digital TV station ABC2, shown every Thursday night at 7:55 pm. Chaser News Alerts are also shown on the ABC&#x27;s Broadband website.

After &quot;CNNNN&quot;, The Chaser went to its next project &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;, which premiered on 17 February 2006 and featured similarly topical comedy to CNNNN.

&quot;CNNNN&quot; previously aired repeats on 7mate. The episodes retained their original endings with the ABC logo.

<text>A multivitamin is a preparation intended to serve as a dietary supplement with vitamins, dietary minerals, and other nutritional elements. Such preparations are available in the form of tablets, capsules, pastilles, powders, liquids, gummies, or injectable formulations. Other than injectable formulations, which are only available and administered under medical supervision, multivitamins are recognized by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (the United Nations&#x27; authority on food standards) as a category of food.

In healthy people, most scientific evidence indicates that multivitamin supplements do not prevent cancer, heart disease, or other ailments, and regular supplementation is not necessary. However, specific groups of people may benefit from multivitamin supplements, for example, people with poor nutrition or those at high risk of macular degeneration, and women who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant.

There is no standardized scientific definition for multivitamin. In the United States, a multivitamin/mineral supplement is defined as a supplement containing three or more vitamins and minerals that does not include herbs, hormones, or drugs, where each vitamin and mineral is included at a dose below the tolerable upper intake level as determined by the Food and Drug Board, and does not present a risk of adverse health effects.

== Products and components ==
Many multivitamin &quot;formulas&quot; contain vitamin C, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, B12, A, E, D2 (or D3), K, potassium, iodine, selenium, borate, zinc, calcium, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, beta carotene, and/or iron. Multivitamins are typically available in a variety of formulas based on age and sex, or (as in prenatal vitamins) based on more specific nutritional needs; a multivitamin for men might include less iron, while a multivitamin for seniors might include extra vitamin D. Some formulas make a point of including extra antioxidants.

Some nutrients, such as calcium and magnesium, are rarely included at 100% of the recommended allowance because the pill would become too large in size. Most multivitamins come in capsule form; tablets, powders, liquids, and injectable formulations also exist. In the United States, the FDA requires any product marketed as a &quot;multivitamin&quot; to contain at least three vitamins and minerals; furthermore, the dosages must be below a &quot;tolerable upper limit&quot;, and a multivitamin may not include herbs, hormones, or drugs.

== Uses ==
For certain people, particularly for older people, supplementing the diet with additional vitamins and minerals can have health impacts; however, the majority will not benefit. People with dietary imbalances may include those on restrictive diets and those who cannot or will not eat a nutritious diet. Pregnant women and elderly adults have different nutritional needs compared to other adults, and a multivitamin may be indicated by a physician. Generally, medical advice is to avoid multivitamins during pregnancy, particularly those containing vitamin A, unless they are recommended by a health care professional. However, the NHS recommends 10μg of Vitamin D per day throughout the pregnancy and while breastfeeding, and 400μg of folic acid during the first trimester (first 12 weeks of pregnancy). Some women may need to take iron, vitamin C, or calcium supplements during pregnancy, but only on the advice of a doctor.

In the 1999–2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 52% of adults in the United States reported taking at least one dietary supplement in the last month and 35% reported regular use of multivitamin - multimineral supplements. Women versus men, older adults versus younger adults, non-Hispanic whites versus non-Hispanic blacks, and those with higher education levels versus lower education levels (among other categories) were more likely to take multivitamins. Individuals who use dietary supplements (including multivitamins) generally report higher dietary nutrient intakes and healthier diets. Additionally, adults with a history of prostate and breast cancers were more likely to use dietary and multivitamin supplements.

== Precautions ==

The amounts of each vitamin type in multivitamin formulations are generally adapted to correlate with what is believed to result in optimal health effects in large population groups. However, these standard amounts may not correlate with what is optimal in certain subpopulations, such as in children, pregnant women and people with certain medical conditions and medication.

The health benefit of vitamins generally follows a biphasic dose-response curve, taking the shape of a bell curve, with the area in the middle being the safe-intake range and the edges representing deficiency and toxicity. For example, the Food and Drug Administration recommends that adults on a 2,000 calorie diet get between 60 and 90 milligrams of vitamin C per day. This is the middle of the bell curve. The upper limit is 2,000 milligrams per day for adults, which is considered potentially dangerous.

In particular, pregnant women should consult their doctors before taking any multivitamins. For example, either an excess or deficiency of vitamin A can cause birth defects.

Long-term use of beta-carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E supplements may shorten life, and increase the risk of lung cancer in people who smoke (especially those smoking more than 20 cigarettes per day), former smokers, people exposed to asbestos, and those who use alcohol. Many common brand supplements in the United States contain levels above the DRI/RDA amounts for some vitamins or minerals.

Severe vitamin and mineral deficiencies require medical treatment and can be very difficult to treat with common over-the-counter multivitamins. In such situations, special vitamin or mineral forms with much higher potencies are available, either as individual components or as specialized formulations.

Multivitamins in large quantities may pose a risk of an acute overdose due to the toxicity of some components, principally iron. However, in contrast to iron tablets, which can be lethal to children, toxicity from overdoses of multivitamins are very rare. There appears to be little risk to supplement users of experiencing acute side effects due to excessive intakes of micronutrients. There also are strict limits on the retinol content for vitamin A during pregnancies that are specifically addressed by prenatal formulas.

As noted in dietary guidelines from Harvard School of Public Health in 2008, multivitamins should not replace healthy eating or make up for unhealthy eating. In 2015, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force analyzed studies that included data for about 450,000 people. The analysis found no clear evidence that multivitamins prevent cancer or heart disease, helped people live longer, or &quot;made them healthier in any way.&quot;

== Research ==
Provided that precautions are taken (such as adjusting the vitamin amounts to what is believed to be appropriate for children, pregnant women or people with certain medical conditions), multivitamin intake is generally safe, but research is still ongoing with regard to what health effects multivitamins have.

Evidence of health effects of multivitamins comes largely from prospective cohort studies, which evaluate health differences between groups that take multivitamins and groups that do not. Correlations between multivitamin intake and health found by such studies may not result from multivitamins themselves, but may reflect underlying characteristics of multivitamin-takers. For example, it has been suggested that multivitamin-takers may, overall, have more underlying diseases (making multivitamins appear as less beneficial in prospective cohort studies). On the other hand, it has also been suggested that multivitamin users may, overall, be more health-conscious (making multivitamins appear as more beneficial in prospective cohort studies). Randomized controlled studies have been encouraged to address this uncertainty.

=== Cohort studies ===

In February 2009, a study conducted in 161,808 postmenopausal women from the Women&#x27;s Health Initiative clinical trials concluded that after eight years of follow-up &quot;multivitamin use has little or no influence on the risk of common cancers, cardiovascular disease, or total mortality&quot;. Another 2010 study in the &quot;Journal of Clinical Oncology&quot; suggested that multivitamin use during chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer had no effect on the outcomes of treatment. A very large prospective cohort study published in 2011, including more than 180,000 participants, found no significant association between multivitamin use and mortality from all causes. The study also found no impact of multivitamin use on the risk of cardiovascular disease or cancer.

A cohort study that received widespread media attention is the Physicians&#x27; Health Study II (PHS-II). PHS-II was a double-blind study of 14,641 male U.S. physicians initially aged 50 years or older (mean age of 64.3) that ran from 1997 to June 1, 2011. The mean time that the men were followed was 11 years. The study compared total cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) for participants taking a daily multivitamin (Centrum Silver by Pfizer) versus a placebo. Compared with the placebo, men taking a daily multivitamin had a small but statistically significant reduction in their total incidence of cancer. In absolute terms, the difference was just 1.3 cancer diagnoses per 1000 years of life. The hazard ratio for cancer diagnosis was 0.92 with a 95% confidence interval spanning 0.86–0.998 (P = .04); this implies a benefit of between 14% and .2% over placebo in the confidence interval. No statistically significant effects were found for any specific cancers or for cancer mortality. As pointed out in an editorial in the same issue of the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot;, the investigators observed no difference in the effect whether the study participants were or were not adherent to the multivitamin intervention, which diminishes the dose–response relationship. The same editorial argued that the study did not properly address the multiple comparisons problem, in that the authors neglected to fully analyze all 28 possible associations in the study—they argue if this had been done, the statistical significance of the results would be lost.

Using the same PHS-II study, researchers concluded that taking a daily multivitamin did not have any effect in reducing heart attacks and other major cardiovascular events, MI, stroke, and CVD mortality.

=== Systematic reviews and meta-analyses ===
One major meta-analysis published in 2011, including previous cohort and case-control studies, concluded that multivitamin use was not significantly associated with the risk of breast cancer. It noted that one Swedish cohort study has indicated such an effect, but with all studies taken together, the association was not statistically significant. A 2012 meta-analysis of ten randomized, placebo-controlled trials published in the &quot;Journal of Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease&quot; found that a daily multivitamin may improve immediate recall memory, but did not affect any other measure of cognitive function.

Another meta-analysis, published in 2013, found that multivitamin-multimineral treatment &quot;has no effect on mortality risk&quot;, and a 2013 systematic review found that multivitamin supplementation did not increase mortality and might slightly decrease it. A 2014 meta-analysis reported that there was &quot;sufficient evidence to support the role of dietary multivitamin/mineral supplements for the decreasing the risk of age-related cataracts.&quot; A 2015 meta-analysis argued that the positive result regarding the effect of vitamins on cancer incidence found in Physicians&#x27; Health Study II (discussed above) should not be overlooked despite the neutral results found in other studies.

Looking at 2012 data, a study published in 2018 presented meta-analyses on cardiovascular disease outcomes and all-cause mortality. It found that &quot;conclusive evidence for the benefit of any supplement across all dietary backgrounds (including deficiency and sufficiency) was not demonstrated; therefore, any benefits seen must be balanced against possible risks.&quot;
The study dismissed the benefits of routinely taking supplements of vitamins C and D, beta-carotene, calcium, and selenium. Results indicated taking niacin may actually be harmful.

In July 2019, another meta-analysis of 24 interventions in 277 trials was conducted and published in &quot;Annals of Internal Medicine&quot;, including a total of almost 1,000,000 participants. The study generally concluded that the vast majority of multivitamins had no significant effect on survival or heart attack risk. The study found a significant effect on heart health in a low-salt diet, and a small effect due to omega-3 and folic acid supplements. This analysis supports the results of two early 2018 studies that found no conclusive benefits from multivitamins for healthy adults.

=== Expert bodies ===
A 2006 report by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concluded that &quot;regular supplementation with a single nutrient or a mixture of nutrients for years has no significant benefits in the primary prevention of cancer, cardiovascular disease, cataract, age-related macular degeneration or cognitive decline.&quot; However, the report noted that multivitamins have beneficial effects for certain sub-populations, such as people with poor nutritional status, that vitamin D and calcium can help prevent fractures in older people, and that zinc and antioxidants can help prevent age-related macular degeneration in high-risk individuals. A 2017 Cochrane Systematic Review found that multivitamins including vitamin E or beta carotene will not delay the onset of macular degeneration or prevent the disease, however, some people with macular degeneration may benefit from multivitamin supplementation as there is evidence that it may delay the progression of the disease. Including lutein and zeaxanthin supplements in with a multivitamin does not improve progression of macular degeneration. The need for high-quality studies looking at the safety of taking multivitamins has been highlighted.

According to the Harvard School of Public Health: &quot;... many people don&#x27;t eat the healthiest of diets. That&#x27;s why a multivitamin can help fill in the gaps, and may have added health benefits.&quot; The U.S. Office of Dietary Supplements, a branch of the National Institutes of Health, suggests that multivitamin supplements might be helpful for some people with specific health problems (for example, macular degeneration). However, the Office concluded that &quot;most research shows that healthy people who take an MVM [multivitamin] do not have a lower chance of diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, or diabetes. Based on current research, it&#x27;s not possible to recommend for or against the use of MVMs to stay healthier longer.&quot;

=== Life expectancy===
A 2024 study of 390,124 healthy adults found that use of multivitamins did not extend life expectancy.

=== History and debate ===
The history of multivitamins begins in the early 20th century when advancements in nutritional science led to the discovery of essential vitamins and minerals. Initially, multivitamins were designed to respond to widespread nutritional deficiencies. These supplements were seen as a practical solution to combat malnutrition, improving public health by providing vital nutrients that were otherwise scarce.

As the 20th century progressed, the use of multivitamins expanded beyond addressing deficiencies. With the rise of the wellness industry, they became popularized as a convenient way to enhance overall health, even for those with access to sufficient nutrition. However, as marketing strategies evolved, the emphasis shifted from necessity to preventative health and general well-being, often without sound scientific backing.

The role of multivitamins has since been increasingly questioned. Some still view them as beneficial, especially in cases of specific deficiencies. A growing body of research suggests that for many people, multivitamins act more as a placebo than a necessary supplement. This indicates a shift in the epistemology of vitamins, where people are generally more aware of them and their properties but there is a gap in their knowledge of the scientific research surrounding them

Studies have shown that multivitamins can have positive effects on mood and energy, but there is little evidence to support an increase in general health and life expectancy.  

Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), passed in 1994 in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is not responsible for testing the risks and efficacy of dietary supplements. Manufacturers are not required to present data on the effectiveness of multivitamins or disclose known side effects to the FDA. Furthermore, manufacturers are not required to test human safety of dietary supplements.

=== Ethnographic research ===
Ethnographic research has investigated possible reasons behind the widespread use of multivitamins in societies where scientific knowledge is dominant, despite the limited empirical evidence supporting new products. The findings reveal various socio-cultural factors contributing to their common use, including:

* Harm reduction: The cultural belief that multivitamins can mitigate risks associated with unhealthy lifestyles, conventional medicines, deficient diets, harmful environmental influences, or genetic predispositions.
* Personal agency: The desire to gain control over one’s body and well-being.
* Social proof: The perception of multivitamins’ effectiveness based on the experiences and behavior of friends, family and community members.
* Social belonging: Marketing strategies that promote identity-building by targeting specific age groups, genders, or personal interests.
* Biopolitics: The pursuit of productivity and reliability, as framed by capitalist societal expectations.

From anthropological and psychological perspectives, the widespread consumption of multivitamins can be seen as an example of &#x27;magical thinking,&#x27; a form of reasoning that seeks to explain phenomena through non-scientific means, distinct from &#x27;irrational thinking’.

=== ASD Research ===
In 2019, a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the relationship between ‘maternal multivitamin supplementation’ and children being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was published in &quot;Nutritional Research&quot;. The research was conducted in the previous year and involved using the ‘random effects’ model on 9 independent trials consisting of 231,163 children across 4459 cases. The results of this study indicated that pregnant women using multivitamin supplements during the prenatal period reduced the risk of their children being diagnosed with autism compared to their counterparts. Furthermore, the systematic review and meta-analysis found that women who took multivitamins prior to becoming pregnant saw a further reduced risk. The authors recommend further study.

In 2021, a similar systematic review and meta-analysis examining the relationship between prenatal multivitamins and children being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was published in &quot;Nutrients&quot;. The study involved 904,947 children encompassing 8159 cases. The study concluded that while no distinct association was found, there was substantial evidence of reduced risk in high quality studies, multivitamin use during early pregnancy, tested prospective studies and evidence following the removal of a single outlier study.

=== United States ===
The first person to formulate vitamins in the US was Dr. Forrest C. Shaklee. Shaklee introduced a product he dubbed &quot;Shaklee&#x27;s Vitalized Minerals&quot; in 1915, which he sold until adopting the now ubiquitous term &quot;vitamin&quot; in 1929.

Because of their categorization as a dietary supplement by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), most multivitamins sold in the U.S. are not required to undergo the testing procedures typical of pharmaceutical drugs. However, some multivitamins contain very high doses of one or several vitamins or minerals, or are specifically intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease, and therefore require a prescription or medicinal license in the U.S. Since such drugs contain no new substances, they do not require the same testing as would be required by a New Drug Application, but were allowed on the market as drugs due to the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation program.

=== Australia ===
Vitamins are classed as low-risk medications by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), and are therefore not assessed for efficacy, unlike most medicines sold in Australia. They require that the product is safe and that claims of efficacy can only be made in regards to minor ailments. No claims can be made about serious conditions. The TGA does not examine the contents of the product and whether it is what the label says it is, but they claim to carry out &quot;targeted and random surveillance of products on the market.&quot; They encourage people to report any unsafe products to them.

The TGA, however, has been criticized, by people such as Allan Asher, a regulatory expert and former deputy chair of the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, for allowing more than a thousand types of claim, 86% of which are not supported by scientific evidence, including &quot;softens hardness&quot;, &quot;replenishes gate of vitality&quot; and &quot;moistens dryness in the triple burner&quot;.

<text>&quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot;, also published as &quot;The Hounds of Zaroff&quot;, is a short story by Richard Connell, first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on January 19, 1924, with illustrations by Wilmot Emerton Heitland. The story features a big-game hunter from New York City who falls from a yacht and swims to what seems to be an abandoned and isolated island in the Caribbean, where he is hunted by a Russian aristocrat. The story is inspired by the big-game hunting safaris in Africa and South America that were particularly fashionable among wealthy Americans in the 1920s.

The story has been adapted numerous times, most notably as the 1932 RKO Pictures film &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot;, starring Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks and Fay Wray, and for a 1943 episode of the CBS Radio series &quot;Suspense&quot;, starring Orson Welles. It has been called the &quot;most popular short story ever written in English.&quot; Upon its publication, it won the O. Henry Award.

&quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; entered the public domain in the United States in 2020.

== Summary ==
Big-game hunter Sanger Rainsford and his friend Whitney are traveling by ship to the Amazon rainforest for a jaguar hunt. After a discussion about the nearby Ship-Trap Island, which has an evil reputation among sailors, Whitney goes to bed while Rainsford stays on deck to smoke his pipe. Hearing gunshots in the distance, he rushes to the rail for a better look and accidentally falls overboard. Rainsford swims to Ship-Trap and finds an opulent chateau inhabited by two Cossacks: the owner, General Zaroff, and his gigantic deaf-mute servant, Ivan.

Zaroff, another big-game hunter, knows of Rainsford from his published account of hunting snow leopards in Tibet. Over dinner, he explains that although he has been hunting animals since he was a boy, he has decided that killing big game has become boring for him. After escaping the Russian Revolution, he purchased Ship-Trap, built a home for himself, and rigged the island with lights to lure passing ships into the jagged rocks surrounding it. He takes the survivors captive and hunts them for sport, giving them food, clothing, a knife, and a three-hour head start, and using only a small-caliber pistol for himself. Any captives who can elude Zaroff, Ivan, and a pack of hunting dogs for three days are set free; to date, though, Zaroff has never lost a hunt. Captives are offered a choice between being hunted or turned over to Ivan, who once served as official knouter for the Great White Czar. Rainsford denounces the hunt as barbarism, but Zaroff replies by claiming that &quot;life is for the strong.&quot; Zaroff is enthused to have another world-class hunter as a companion and, at lunch the next day, offers to take Rainsford along with him on his next hunt. When Rainsford staunchly refuses and demands to leave the island, Zaroff decides to hunt him instead. Rainsford reluctantly accepts the challenge and receives his equipment from Ivan.

During his head start, Rainsford lays an intricate trail in the forest and then climbs a tree. Zaroff finds him easily, but decides to toy with him, standing under the tree and smoking a cigarette before abruptly departing. After the failed attempt at eluding Zaroff, Rainsford builds a deadfall trap consisting of a dead tree balanced against a living one. The trap injures Zaroff&#x27;s shoulder, forcing him to return home for treatment, but he calls out his respect for Rainsford&#x27;s ingenuity as he leaves. Rainsford next digs a trapping pit and plants sharpened stakes at its bottom; one of Zaroff&#x27;s dogs falls in and is killed. The next morning, he sacrifices his knife to build a trap that kills Ivan when he stumbles into it, then dives off a cliff and into the sea to escape Zaroff and his approaching dogs. Disappointed at Rainsford&#x27;s apparent suicide, Zaroff returns home and settles in for the night. His relaxation is disturbed by two thoughts: the difficulty of replacing Ivan and the fact that Rainsford has escaped him. 

Zaroff locks himself in his bedroom and turns on the lights, only to find Rainsford waiting for him, having swum around the island to evade the dogs and sneak into the chateau. Zaroff offers congratulations for defeating him, but Rainsford prepares to fight him, saying that the hunt is not yet over. A delighted Zaroff responds that the loser will be fed to his dogs, while the winner will sleep in his bed. Sometime later, Rainsford appreciates the comfort of the bed.

== Real-life parallels ==
There is a possible reference to &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; in letters that the Zodiac Killer wrote to newspapers in the San Francisco Bay Area in his three-part cipher: &quot;Man is the most dangerous animal of all to kill&quot;, though he may have come up with the idea independently. The 1932 film version of &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; is mentioned a number of times in the 2007 film &quot;Zodiac&quot;, a fictionalized depiction of the Zodiac Killer.

Clive Cussler wrote a book entitled &quot;Dragon&quot; in which he mentions Richard Connell&#x27;s &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; and has a few long chapters where his Japanese manhunter emulates the story. It takes place on a small, isolated island and is strongly reminiscent of the Connell story.

<text>The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF–Inkotanyi; , FPR) is the ruling political party in Rwanda.

The RPF was founded in December 1987 by Rwandan Tutsi in exile in Uganda because of the ethnic violence that had occurred during the Rwandan Hutu Revolution in 1959–1962. In 1990, the RPF started the Rwandan Civil War in an attempt to overthrow the government, which was dominated by Hutu. Later on, the Rwandan genocide occurred that ended on 4 July with the RPF conquest of the entire country. The RPF have ruled the country since then as a one-party state, and its current leader, Paul Kagame, became the president of Rwanda in 2000, and remains in office.

Since 1994, RPF rule has been characterized by political repression, relative stability, and economic growth. Among other policies implemented by the government are the non-recognition of ethnic identities and a wide-ranging prohibition on what the government calls &quot;genocide ideology&quot;, including discussion of ethnic differences. Despite an official nonsectarian identity, as of 2021, a large majority of officials in the RPF-led government are Tutsi.

==History==

=== Before RPF ===
Rwanda is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa, with over 14 million people living in a comparatively small territory of 26,338 square kilometers. Unlike other African countries, the current state of Rwanda was partly based on the pre-colonial Kingdom of Rwanda, governed by a Tutsi monarchy. When the European colonialists arrived in Rwanda (Germans from 1899 to 1916 and Belgians from 1916 to 1962), the country lost all political, economic, and cultural independence. The colonial rulers chose Rwanda&#x27;s leaders and set laws in a way that suited their interests.

The colonial rulers employed the divide-and-conquer strategy, spreading the idea that Rwandans:

# Came from different places
# Did not enter the nation as a group
# Lacked equal intelligence
# Shouldn&#x27;t work in the same fields
# Should not receive the same education

This strategy increased divisions between Tutsi, Hutu, and Batwa.

In the early 1950s, Rwandans fought for their independence alongside other African countries. Since Tutsis made up the majority of those who fought for Rwanda&#x27;s independence, the Belgians started to propagate the idea that Tutsis were outsiders who had originated in Abyssinia or modern-day Ethiopia.

===Rwandese Alliance for National Unity===
The Rwandese Alliance for National Unity (RANU) was created in December 1979 in Nairobi, Kenya, by young Rwandan Tutsi refugee intellectuals, most of whom had grown up in Uganda. The RANU political organization was established to discuss a possible return to Rwanda. Though primarily a forum for intellectual discussion, it became militant after Milton Obote&#x27;s election in 1980, resulting in many Tutsi refugees joining Yoweri Museveni in fighting the Ugandan Bush War.

Following the overthrow of Idi Amin in 1979, Obote denounced Museveni&#x27;s National Resistance Army (NRA) as composed of Banyarwanda. Subsequently, a failed attempt to force all Rwandan refugees into refugee camps in February 1982 resulted in a massive purge, driving 40,000 refugees back into Rwanda. Rwanda declared that they recognized only 4,000 of these as Rwandan nationals, while Uganda declared that they would take back only 1,000. The remaining 35,000 were left in a legal limbo along the border region for years, and many refugee youths left to join the National Resistance Army.

=== RPF ===
After the Museveni government was formed in 1986, Fred Rwigema, a Rwandan refugee commander, was appointed Uganda&#x27;s deputy minister of defense and deputy army commander-in-chief, second only to Museveni in the military chain of command for Uganda. Paul Kagame was appointed acting chief of military intelligence. Rwandan refugees formed a large number of NRA officers because they had joined the rebellion early and thus had accumulated more experience. The contributions of the Rwandans in the Ugandan Bush War were immediately recognized by the new government. Six months after taking power, Museveni reversed the decades-old legal regime and declared that Rwandans who had resided in Uganda would be entitled to citizenship after 10 years. In December 1987, RANU held its seventh congress in Kampala and renamed itself the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) stands for Unity, Sovereignty and Security, Economy, Democratic Leadership, Fighting Corruption, Eliminating All Causes of Refugee Status, International Relations, Social Welfare, and Fighting Genocide and Its Ideology; the new RPF, dominated by Rwandan intellectuals who were in exile from different countries and military officers, was far more strong and ambitious than the original RANU.

=== Rwandan Civil War ===
On 1 October 1990, the Rwandan government led by Juvénal Habyarimana with the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND) party which was known to rule with pro-Hutu policies, was invaded by the Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA), the wing army force of RPF led by Major-General Fred Gisa Rwigema, the starting of the Rwandan Civil War. The RPA incursion was initially successful, despite the death of Fred Rwigema from a bullet on 2 October. Paul Kagame, who had been doing military studies in the United States, returned to take over the RPA. Thereafter the RPA resorted to guerrilla attacks, focusing on the Byumba and Ruhengeri areas, and gained control of much of the north of the country in 1992. Eventually, negotiations between the RPF and the Rwandan government led to the signing of the Arusha Accords in 1993, resulting in RPF personnel and other refugees being allowed to return to the country.

=== 1994 genocide in Rwanda ===
On 6 April 1994, President Juvénal Habyarimana&#x27;s plane was shot down near Kigali International Airport, killing him and Cyprien Ntaryamira, the President of Burundi. Responsibility for the assassination has not been conclusively established; it is thought that either Hutu extremists or the RPF carried it out. The shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for the Rwandan genocide which began within a few hours. Over approximately 100 days, more than one million Tutsi people, were killed and an estimated 150,000 to 250,000 women were raped. 
 The RPF with its wing army fought the government and took control of the country. The Rwandan genocide was completely stopped when Kigali was captured by the RPF wing army on 4 July.

=== Post-1994 genocide in Rwanda governance ===
After the RPF stopped the genocide and took control of the country, in 1994, it formed a government of national unity headed by a president, Pasteur Bizimungu. Paul Kagame became Minister of Defense and vice-president. President Bizimungu served for six years and resigned from government in 2000, after forming his political party, he was arrested in 2002. Sentenced to 15 years in prison, he was released with a pardon from President Kagame in 2007. In February 1998 Kagame was elected president of the RPF, replacing Alexis Kanyarengwe, and in March 2000 he became the national president.

Following a constitutional referendum in 2003, Kagame was elected president with 95% of the vote. The RPF formed a coalition with several smaller parties, which received 74% of the vote in the 2003 parliamentary elections, winning 40 of the 53 elected seats in the Chamber of Deputies. The coalition won 42 seats in the 2008 parliamentary elections, and Kagame was re-elected as president in 2010 with 93% of the vote. The 2013 parliamentary elections saw the RPF-led coalition win 41 seats. In 2017, Kagame was re-elected for a third term with 98.8 percent of the vote. He was sworn in for another seven-year term on 18 August 2017.

In the post-genocide era, RPF as a ruling party established Rwanda&#x27;s national unity and democratic government that continues to challenge itself foremost as a right movement to strive for national unity, democracy, and development. To achieve these since 2000, RPF chairman and president of Rwanda Kagame, has been elected three times to rule Rwanda consecutively. Under his leadership, the Rwandan government has invented and practiced unique national programs in ensuring self-reliance including Community work (&quot;Umuganda&quot;) and Gacaca courts.

== Leadership ==

=== Current leaders ===
Paul Kagame is the current Chairman of the RPF after being re-elected with other members of the National Executive Committee (NEC) during the 16th party&#x27;s national congress that met on 2 April 2023. The elected committee is responsible for the day-to-day management of the party activities and will serve a five-year term.

In July 2024, Rwanda held elections, confirming Paul Kagame&#x27;s victory with 99.18% of the votes on July 15. This result reflects the trust many Rwandan citizens still have in him, especially since he played a crucial role in stopping the Rwanda Genocide in 1994. However, the ruling party saw its representation in parliament decrease, securing 37 of 53 directly elected seats, down from 40. Only two candidates were allowed to run against Paul Kagame, while others were barred from participating. The Rwandan Electoral Commission stated that these candidates lacked the necessary documents to run in the 2024 election. The Democratic Green Party retained two seats, with the remainder going to the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).

<doc id="622766" wikidata="Q3326675" url="?curid=622766" title="Republican Democratic Movement">
<text>The Republican Democratic Movement (, MDR) was a political party in Rwanda.

==History==
The party was established in 1991, after the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND) lost its monopoly on politics and opposition parties were legalised. The MDR took its name from MDR-Parmehutu, the ruling party in the early 1960s. Like Parmehutu, the MDR&#x27;s primary base of political support was Hutus in the centre of the country, particularly Kayibanda&#x27;s home prefecture of Gitarama.

In late 1991, the MDR joined with the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party to form an opposition coalition that placed pressure on President Juvénal Habyarimana and the MRND to implement democratic reforms. In March 1992 Habyarimana named a multiparty government with a Prime Minister, Dismas Nsengiyaremye, from the MDR. He was succeeded as Prime Minister in July 1993 by another MDR member, Agathe Uwilingiyimana.

The MDR was ostensibly moderate but developed numerous extremist factions which professed Hutu Power beliefs. The most prominent extremist faction of the MDR was led by the party&#x27;s vice president, Froduald Karamira, who was later executed for his participation in the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

After its victory in the Rwandan Civil War in 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) named a new Broad Based Government of National Unity with the MDR&#x27;s Faustin Twagiramungu as Prime Minister. He remained in office until 1995. In 2001, the MDR&#x27;s Bernard Makuza was named prime minister.

With elections scheduled for mid-2003, the MDR was the only opposition party able to challenge the RPF. However, on 15 April 2003, Parliament voted to dissolve the party and accused it of being &quot;divisionist&quot;. Several former MDR members formed the Party for Progress and Concord later that year.
