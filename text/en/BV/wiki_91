<text>Claude Cohen-Tannoudji (; born 1 April 1933) is a French physicist. He shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics with Steven Chu and William Daniel Phillips for research in methods of laser cooling and trapping atoms. Currently he is still an active researcher, working at the École normale supérieure (Paris).

==Early life==
Cohen-Tannoudji was born in Constantine, French Algeria, to Algerian Sephardic Jewish parents Abraham Cohen-Tannoudji and Sarah Sebbah. When describing his origins Cohen-Tannoudji said: &quot;My family, originally from Tangier, settled in Tunisia and then in Algeria in the 16th century after having fled Spain during the Inquisition. In fact, our name, Cohen-Tannoudji, means simply the Cohen family from Tangiers. The Algerian Jews obtained the French citizenship in 1870 after Algeria became a French colony in 1830.&quot;

After finishing secondary school in Algiers in 1953, Cohen-Tannoudji left for Paris to attend the École Normale Supérieure. His professors included Henri Cartan, Laurent Schwartz, and Alfred Kastler.

In 1958 he married Jacqueline Veyrat, a high school teacher, with whom he has three children. His studies were interrupted when he was conscripted into the army, in which he served for 28 months (longer than usual because of the Algerian War). In 1960 he resumed working toward his doctorate, which he obtained from the École Normale Supérieure under the supervision of Alfred Kastler and Jean Brossel at the end of 1962.

==Career==

After his dissertation, he started teaching quantum mechanics at the University of Paris. From 1964-67, he was an associate professor at the university and from 1967-1973 he was a full professor. His lecture notes were the basis of the popular textbook, &quot;Quantum Mechanics&quot; (), which he wrote with his colleagues and Franck Laloë. He also continued his research work on atom-photon interactions, and his research team developed the model of the &quot;dressed atom&quot;.

In 1973, he became a professor at the Collège de France. In the early 1980s, he started to lecture on radiative forces on atoms in laser light fields. He also formed a laboratory there with Alain Aspect, Christophe Salomon, and Jean Dalibard to study laser cooling and trapping. He even took a statistical approach to laser cooling with the use of stable distributions.

In 1976, he took sabbatical leave from the Collège de France, and lectured at Harvard University and MIT. At Harvard, he was a Loeb Lecturer for two weeks, and at MIT, he was a visiting professor. 

His work eventually led to the Nobel Prize in physics in 1997 &quot;for the development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light&quot;, shared with Steven Chu and William Daniel Phillips. Cohen-Tannoudji was the first physics Nobel prize winner born in an Arab country. 

In 2015, Cohen-Tannoudji signed the &quot;Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change&quot; on the final day of the 65th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting. The declaration was signed by a total of 76 Nobel Laureates and handed to then-President of the French Republic, François Hollande, as part of the successful COP21 climate summit in Paris.

<doc id="630822" wikidata="Q1113097" url="?curid=630822" title="Civil partnership in the United Kingdom">
<text>Civil partnership in the United Kingdom is a form of civil union between couples open to both same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples. It was introduced via the Civil Partnership Act 2004 by the Labour government. The Act initially permitted only same-sex couples to form civil partnerships, but the law was expanded to include opposite-sex couples in 2019.

==History==
Civil partnerships were introduced for same-sex couples under the terms of the Civil Partnership Act 2004. Before this, an informal London Partnership Register had been set up in 2001 by then-Mayor of London Ken Livingstone but without any legal recognition.

In February 2018, the United Kingdom and Scottish governments began reviewing civil partnerships, potentially to expand them to include opposite-sex couples. In June 2018, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled that restricting civil partnerships to same-sex couples was incompatible with the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights as enacted in Schedule 1 to the Human Rights Act 1998. The UK Government was obliged to change the law to allow opposite-sex couples in England and Wales to enter into civil partnerships. This change was unsuccessfully opposed by the Church of England and many Christian denominations.

Opposite-sex couples have been able to enter into civil partnerships in England and Wales since 2 December 2019. Similar reforms have been in place in Northern Ireland since 13 January 2020. In Scotland, legislation to allow opposite-sex civil partnerships passed the Scottish Parliament on 23 June 2020. These changes extend the legal recognition of relationships granted under the Civil Partnership Act 2004, allowing couples irrespective of sex to obtain essentially the same rights and responsibilities as civil marriage.

Civil partners are entitled to the same property rights as married couples, the same exemption as married couples on inheritance tax, social security and pension benefits, and also the ability to obtain parental responsibility for a partner&#x27;s children, as well as responsibility for reasonable maintenance of one&#x27;s partner and their children, tenancy rights, full life insurance recognition, next of kin rights in hospitals, and others.

When the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales in March 2014, civil partnerships remained available to same-sex couples and granted those couples in a civil partnership the ability to convert their civil partnership into a marriage. The equivalent Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014 does not grant that ability to couples in Scotland, but includes provisions for its later introduction, and does permit those already in civil partnership to marry without first dissolving the mutual civil partnership; it is not possible to have both. When same-sex marriage became legal in Northern Ireland on 13 January 2020, couples married elsewhere were legally recognised as married in Northern Ireland. Couples in Northern Ireland have been allowed to convert their civil partnerships into marriages since 7 December 2020.

== Law and procedure ==

A civil partnership is a relationship between two people, formed when they register as civil partners of each other, which ends only on death, dissolution or annulment. Part 2 of the Act relates to England and Wales, Part 3 to Scotland and Part 4 to Northern Ireland.

=== Formation and registration ===
A civil partnership is formed once both individuals have signed the civil partnership document in the presence of a registrar and two witnesses.

Under the standard procedure, before registration, each party will usually have to give notice to the appropriate authority. Each party must have resided in the British jurisdiction in which they intend to register (England and Wales or Northern Ireland) for at least seven days immediately preceding the giving of notice, and there will, in most cases, be a fifteen-day waiting period after notice is given.

A civil partnership in Wales () may be conducted either in English or – provided that both registering parties, the registrar and witnesses are able to understand and write in the Welsh language – in Welsh. Civil partnership documents issued in Wales (regardless of the registering language) follow a standardised bilingual English and Welsh format.

In Scotland there is no minimum residence requirement to contract a valid partnership.

During the waiting period, the proposed partnership is publicised and anyone may make a formal objection. If there is such an objection, the proposed civil partnership cannot be formed unless the objection is withdrawn or if the registration authority is satisfied that the objection ought not to prevent the formation of the civil partnership. Provided no objection has been recorded, or any recorded objections have been cleared, the registration authority must issue a civil partnership schedule at the request of either party upon the expiration of the waiting period. The civil partnership must then be registered within twelve months of the notice first being given.

Specific registration procedures apply to certain special circumstances, e.g. concerning the housebound, detained persons and those seriously ill and in danger of death.

==== Eligibility ====
Each party to the civil partnership must be at least 16 years of age. Anyone below 18 years of age will usually need parental consent, except in Scotland where such consent is not required. Furthermore, the parties to the proposed partnership must not be within the prohibited degrees of relationship specified in part 1 of schedule 1, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Act (paragraph 3 was not brought into force following a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights against similar provisions for marriage). Any party who is already in a marriage or a civil partnership is ineligible to register.

Where permitted, civil partnerships may be registered at British embassies or consulates-general. As of October 2009, the British Embassy in France listed 28 such places as being authorised to hold civil partnerships. For such registrations, at least one partner must be a British citizen. Overseas couples wishing to register their partnership in the UK must reside in the country for seven days prior to application for the partnership, and wait a further fifteen days before the civil partnership may be formed.

====Later developments====

===== Venues =====

It is prohibited for civil partnerships to include any readings, music or symbols that are religious. It was originally prohibited for the ceremonies to take place in religious venues. On 17 February 2011, the UK government announced that, as the result of the passing of the Equality Act 2010, it would bring forward the necessary measures to remove the latter restriction in England and Wales, although religious venues would not be compelled to offer civil partnerships. This was implemented by The Marriages and Civil Partnerships (Approved Premises) (Amendment) Regulations 2011. The first civil partnership to be registered in a place of worship in the UK was at Ullet Road Unitarian Church in Liverpool on 6 May 2012.

===== Same-sex marriage =====

On 26 September 2011, the Home Office published the following statement on its website:

A public consultation to consider how to make civil marriage available to same-sex couples will begin in March 2012, the government announced today.

As part of its commitment to advancing equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals the government announced in February this year its intention to look at how legislation could develop on equal civil marriage. Minister for Equalities Lynne Featherstone said:

&quot;I am delighted to confirm that early next year, this government will begin a formal consultation on equal civil marriage for same-sex couples. This would allow us to make any legislative changes before the end of this Parliament. We will be working closely with all those who have an interest in the area to understand their views ahead of the formal consultation.&quot;

The consultation will only cover civil marriage for same sex couples – not religious marriage.

It falls within the respective jurisdictions of the Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly to decide whether or not to remove the restrictions in the areas of civil partnerships and marriage. From September to December 2011, the Scottish Government held a consultation on not only removing religious prohibitions for civil partnerships but also legalising same-sex marriage within that country. In the foreword to the consultation document, Deputy First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon stated&quot;The Scottish Government is choosing to make its initial views clear at the outset of this consultation. We tend towards the view that religious ceremonies for civil partnerships should no longer be prohibited and that same sex marriage should be introduced so that same sex couples have the option of getting married if that is how they wish to demonstrate their commitment to each other. We also believe that no religious body or its celebrants should be required to carry out same sex marriages or civil partnership ceremonies.&quot;

Unlike the English and Welsh Consultation due to begin in March 2012, the Consultation for Scotland dealt with the issue of same-sex marriage in a religious context. On 10 December 2011, &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper reported that some 50,000 responses had been received and that a government spokesperson stated that an analysis would be published in the spring of 2012. Despite the legalisation of same-sex marriage by the Scottish Parliament in February 2014, the Government of Scotland has yet to decide whether or not to open civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples. Other aspects of Scotland&#x27;s Marriage and Civil Partnership Act which legalised same-sex marriage in Scotland and relate to civil partnership include:
*Possible tests for religious and belief bodies to meet when solemnising marriages or registering civil partnerships, in light of increasing concerns over sham and forced marriages
*Introducing religious and belief ceremonies to register civil partnerships

==== Changes of gender ====
The Gender Recognition Act 2004 allows transgender people to obtain legal recognition for their &#x27;acquired gender&#x27; allowing individuals to obtain a change in sex on birth certificates. Under special provisions of the Civil Partnership Act 2004, in such situations a couple may dissolve their marriage and enter into a civil partnership the same day, and under the provision of the Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration etc) Act 2019 a same-sex marriage can be converted to an opposite-sex civil partnership. Alternatively they can stay married or in a civil partnership if their spouse signs a statutory declaration that they agree to the gender change changing the opposite sex marriage into a same sex marriage or vice versa.

==== Overseas relationships ====
Where a same-sex couple has registered an overseas relationship which is specified in Schedule 20 of the Civil Partnership Act, or meet certain general conditions, they are treated as having formed a civil partnership. The requirements can be found in section 212 and sections 215 to 218 of the Act.

For an overseas relationship to meet the general conditions it must, under the law of the country or territory in which it was formed:

* be exclusive in nature (i.e., the law must not permit a person to be in a civil or marital relationship with more than one person);
* be indeterminate in duration (this would exclude an arrangement whereby the parties agreed to live together for a fixed period of time); and
* result in the parties being treated as a couple (thus excluding local registers which have no legal effects under state/provincial or national law).

=== Legal effect ===

==== Property and financial arrangements ====

The position of civil partners in relation to financial arrangements mirrors that of spouses. For instance, Section 11 of the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1882 applies to civil partnerships; thus, money payable to a surviving partner under a policy of life assurance no longer forms part of the deceased partner&#x27;s estate.

The laws governing wills, administration of estates and family provisions also apply to civil partners as to spouses; thus, provisions governing financial relief under Part 2 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (MCA) and the Domestic Proceedings and Magistrates&#x27; Court Act 1978 also apply to civil partnerships. Tax exemptions available to spouses under s.18 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 are available to civil partners under the Civil Partnership Act 2004. In Scotland the centuries-old system of minimum legal rights to a deceased estate for a widowed spouse were expressly extended to civil partners by section 131 of Act.

In any dispute between civil partners as to title or possession of property, either partner may apply to the Court, which can then make any order in relation to the property, including an order to sell such property. Contributions by either partner to property improvement are recognised if the contributions are substantial and in actual money or money&#x27;s worth.

==== Children ====
When dealing with an application for dissolution, nullity or separation where there is a child in the family, the Court must consider if it should exercise its powers under the Children Act 1989. Section 75 amends the definition of &#x27;a child of the family&#x27; accordingly.

Other amendments were also made to equalise the position of civil partners with that of spouses. Civil partners are able to acquire parental responsibilities as a stepparent under Section 75 of the Act. They may also apply for residence or contact orders. Further, the right to apply for financial provision for children under schedule 1 of the 1989 act was extended to civil partners. Adoption provisions were amended to treat civil partners the same as married couples in Britain, although this does not apply to Northern Ireland at 18 November 2011. The Northern Ireland Adoption law is due to go to the judicial review in December 2011.

==== Other provisions ====
The Act also amended other areas to equalise the position of civil partners. Such areas included matters relating to housing, tenancies and the Fatal Accidents Act 1976. Applicable parts of the Family Law Act 1996 were also amended.

==== Name changing ====
There is no requirement that either party must change their surname upon entering a civil partnership. However, many couples wish to follow marital traditions and seek to change their surname to that of either partner, or combine their names to make a double-barrelled surname. This change can be made after the civil partnership is registered, and authorities will accept a certificate of civil partnership as evidence of name change, e.g. when applying for a passport or a driving licence. In Scotland, names need not be changed to be considered valid (deeds poll do not exist under Scots law), though some English-based companies may still ask for proof from an official such as a Justice of the Peace. Civil partners of male peers or knights do not receive a courtesy title to which the spouse of a peer or knight would be entitled.

=== Ending the partnership ===
Section 37(1) of the Act provides for the making of dissolution, nullity, separation and presumption of death orders. These provisions broadly mirror those governing marriage.

==== Dissolution ====
No applications for dissolution may be made within one year of the formation of the civil partnership, except in Scotland. Like marriage, irretrievable breakdown is the only ground on which the court may make a dissolution order. Also, Section 44 provides that the Court may not make such an order unless the applicant satisfies as to certain facts which are the same as those for divorce under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (MCA), except that adultery cannot be relied on for a civil partnership dissolution: the respondent&#x27;s behaviour, 2 years&#x27; separation and consent, 2 years&#x27; desertion or 5 years&#x27; separation. If the applicant satisfies the court in this respect, the court must make a dissolution order unless it is not convinced by the evidence that the partnership has indeed broken down irretrievably. The MCA section 5 defence is also available. While adultery cannot be cited as a reason in itself for dissolving a civil partnership, it could be cited as an example of unreasonable behaviour.

As with the breakdown of a marriage, the court will have powers to provide financial relief upon dissolution of a Civil Partnership. The court may make Maintenance and lump sum orders, Orders for Sale, Pension Sharing Orders or Property Adjustment Orders.

==== Nullity, separation and presumption of death orders ====

A nullity order is one which annuls a void or voidable civil partnership. Section 49 of the Act provides that a civil partnership is void on grounds of ineligibility to register, if the parties: disregarded certain requirements as to the formation of the partnership, where any party is a minor, where any person whose consent is required (e.g. a parent) has forbidden the formation of the partnership and the court has not given its consent. Where a civil partnership is voidable, applications for nullity orders are subject to the bars of time, knowledge of defect and approbation.

A presumption of death order dissolves the partnership on the grounds that one of the partners is presumed to be dead, while a separation order provides for the separation of the parties. These orders are governed by Sections 55 and 56 of the Act and they largely mirror the position for married couples.

==Differences from marriage==

The contracts of marriage and civil partnerships are very similar though there are some technical differences: venereal disease is a ground for annulment of marriage, but not civil partnership; adultery is a ground for divorce, but not dissolution of civil union; and titles may not be inherited or passed to partners of a civil partnership. Where laws differ for wife and husband, both partners are generally treated like opposite-sex couples. Otherwise, the rules for pensions, survivor benefits, annulment and dissolution are very similar.

==The first same-sex civil partnerships==
The first civil partnership formed under the Civil Partnership Act 2004 took place at 11:00 GMT on 5 December 2005 between Matthew Roche and Christopher Cramp at St Barnabas Hospice, Worthing, West Sussex. The statutory 15-day waiting period was waived as Roche was suffering from a terminal illness: he died the following day. The first partnership registered after the normal waiting period was held in Belfast on 19 December 2005.

The first partnerships formed in Great Britain, after the waiting period, should have occurred on 21 December, but due to a misinterpretation of the rules, the first in Scotland were held on 20 December. The first civil partnerships in England and Wales were formed on 21 December 2005, with Westminster, Hampshire, The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Hammersmith and Fulham and Brighton &amp; Hove conducting the largest numbers.

==Responses from churches==
Civil partnerships were introduced to allow same-sex couples almost identical advantages to marriage without using the word, and were designed to sidestep opposition from Christian churches, especially the Church of England and Catholic Church, which regarded the initiative as undermining conventional marriage.

On 17 February 2011, the UK Government announced its intention to remove the legal barrier to civil partnerships being registered on religious premises by implementing section 202 of the Equality Act 2010, and ran a consultation on this proposal from 31 March to 23 June 2011, and published a summary of its findings on 4 November 2011. The Marriages and Civil Partnerships (Approved Premises) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 came into force in December 2011. This voluntary provision allowed religious organisations that wish to do so to host civil partnership registrations on their religious premises. Faith groups which have applied to have their premises approved for the registration of civil partnerships include the Society of Friends (Quakers), Spiritualists, Unitarians, and United Reformed Church. The first civil partnership to be registered in a place of worship in the UK was at Ullet Road Unitarian Church, Liverpool, on 6 May 2012.

=== Church of England ===
As the established church in England, the Church of England has discussed and established guidelines for clergy entering into civil partnerships. Within the guidelines, &quot;The House of Bishops does not regard entering into a civil partnership as intrinsically incompatible with holy orders, provided the person concerned is willing to give assurances to his or her bishop that the relationship is consistent with the standards for the clergy...The House of Bishops considers it would be a matter of social injustice to exclude from ministry those who are faithful to the teaching of the Church, and who decide to register a civil partnership.&quot;

In 2010, the General Synod extended pension and employee rights to clergy who have entered in a same-sex civil partnership. In 2013, the church ruled that priests in civil partnerships could become bishops. Speaking on its support for partnerships, the church has communicated that &quot;The Church of England recognises that same-sex relationships often embody fidelity and mutuality. Civil partnerships enable these Christian virtues to be recognised socially and legally in a proper framework.&quot; The Anglican Church was also among the institutions that supports keeping civil partnerships as a legal option. In 2018, the Church said &quot;We believe that Civil Partnerships still have a place, including for some Christian LGBTI [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex] couples who see them as a way of gaining legal recognition of their relationship.&quot;

In December 2023, the Church authorised blessings for same-sex couples following a civil partnership or marriage during ordinary church services. The first official blessings for same-sex couples in a civil partnership, or civil marriage, took place on 17 December 2023. Informal prayers may also be said with couples as the Chancellor of the Diocese of London explained, &quot;There is no prohibition on prayers&#x27; being said in church or there being a &#x27;service&#x27;&quot;. In July 2024, the General Synod of the Church of England voted to support &quot;stand-alone&quot; services of blessing for same-sex couples after a civil partnership or marriage.

The Church of England Archbishops&#x27; Council confirmed that:

* Clergy may enter into a civil partnership as this does not conflict with the church&#x27;s doctrine on marriage
* Clergy may offer &quot;prayers of support&quot; on behalf of same-sex couples following a civil partnership or civil marriage

==Statistics==
18,059 couples entered into a civil partnership between December 2005 and the end of December 2006, with a further 8,728 taking place in 2007, 7,169 in 2008, 6,281 in 2009, 6,385 in 2010, and 6,795 in 2011.

The end of 2011 also saw a total of 53,417 civil partnerships between 106,834 people, meaning estimates by the 2004 Labour government of between 11,000 and 22,000 people entering partnerships by 2010 were less than a fifth of the actual amount. 25.5% of civil partnerships in the UK were granted in London, followed by Brighton and Hove. The average age for a civil partnership was 40 for men and 38 for women in 2011.

By 2009, 487 couples in 20 countries were registered at British Consulates. Six of these countries have since legislated for same-sex marriage, civil partnerships or something similar. British Embassies in a further nine countries are licensed to conduct British Civil Partnership but had yet to perform their first.

In 2020, 7,566 opposite-sex civil partnerships were formed in England and Wales, of which 7,208 were registered in England and 358 in Wales. This is the first year in which statistics on opposite-sex civil partnerships were gathered. In comparison, 785 civil partnerships formed between same-sex couples in England and Wales in 2020, of which 745 were registered in England and 40 in Wales; 2020 saw the lowest number of same-sex civil partnerships recorded since 2005.
==In the Crown dependencies and British overseas territories==

Most of the overseas territories have not indicated plans to introduce civil partnerships. The British Crown dependency of Jersey has civil partnerships available, but only for same sex couples; a law to allow for opposite-sex civil partnerships was passed by the States Assembly on 3 March 2022 and, following approval by the Privy Council, will take effect by the end of 2022. Both opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples within the Falkland Islands, Isle of Man and Gibraltar have civil marriage and civil partnerships available as of 2016.

Civil partnerships are legal within the Cayman Islands following enactment of the Civil Partnership Law on 4 September 2020.

==Civil partnerships for opposite-sex couples==
After the establishment of civil partnerships, several individuals and groups advocated extension to opposite-sex couples. A campaign group known as Equal Civil Partnerships was organised, specifically to call upon the government to extend civil partnerships to all couples. A London couple, Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, sued for recognition of their relationship as a civil partnership, but were unsuccessful in the High Court on 29 January 2016 and again in the Court of Appeal on 21 February 2017. The &quot;Civil Partnership Act 2004 (Amendment) Bill 2016–17&quot;, a private member&#x27;s bill, was filed by Tim Loughton on 21 July 2016 to amend the Civil Partnership Act 2004 and extend civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples, but after second reading debate took place on 13 January 2017, further debate was postponed and eventually cancelled due to the calling of a general election in June 2017.

By July 2016, the Isle of Man was the only part of the British Isles where both same- and opposite-sex couples could choose between civil partnership and marriage. The Isle made this possible at the same time as the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the territory.

In June 2018, the Supreme Court ruled in the Steinfeld-Keidan case that restricting civil partnerships to same-sex couples was discriminatory and mandated that the Government change the law, though did not set a timeline for doing so. In response, the Prime Minister announced in October 2018 that civil partnerships would be opened to heterosexual couples.

On 19 July 2017, a bill, the Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration etc) Act Bill requiring the Secretary of State to issue regulations amending the Civil Partnership Act, so that opposite-sex couples may enter into civil partnerships was introduced by Tim Loughton as a private member&#x27;s bill through the ballot of private members. The bill received royal assent on 26 March 2019 and came into effect on the same day. Section 2 of the Act required the Secretary of State to amend the Civil Partnership Act 2004 by 31 December 2019, so that people of the opposite sex could enter into civil partnerships. The regulations came into effect on 2 December 2019, the date upon which opposite-sex couples could register their intent to form a civil partnership. This expansion of civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples applied only in England and Wales, and not Scotland or Northern Ireland.

Steinfeld and Keidan became one of the first mixed-sex civil partners in the UK on 31 December 2019, with a ceremony at Kensington and Chelsea Register Office. 167 opposite-sex couples entered into civil partnerships on the same day in England and Wales.

=== Northern Ireland and Scotland ===
Civil partnerships became available to opposite-sex couples in Northern Ireland on 13 January 2020. This change came at the same time as the UK Government issued regulations extending same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland. The Scottish Government introduced legislation allowing opposite-sex civil partnerships to the Scottish Parliament on 30 September 2019, and the bill passed the parliament by a vote of 64–0 on 23 June 2020. It received royal assent on 28 July 2020 and has been in effect since 1 June 2021.

<text>William Daniel Phillips (born November 5, 1948) is an American physicist. He shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 with Steven Chu and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji.

==Biography==
Phillips was born to William Cornelius Phillips of Juniata, Pennsylvania, and Mary Catherine Savino of Ripacandida, Italy. He is of Italian descent on his mother&#x27;s side and of Welsh descent on his father&#x27;s side. His parents moved to Camp Hill (near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) in 1959, where he attended high school and graduated valedictorian of his class in 1966. He graduated from Juniata College in 1970 &quot;summa cum laude&quot;. After that he received his physics doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1978 he joined National Bureau of Standards (currently NIST).

In 1996, he received the Albert A. Michelson Medal from The Franklin Institute.

Phillips&#x27; doctoral thesis concerned the magnetic moment of the proton in H2O. He later did some work with Bose–Einstein condensates. In 1997 he won the Nobel Prize in Physics together with Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and Steven Chu for his contributions to laser cooling, a technique to slow the movement of gaseous atoms in order to better study them, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and especially for his invention of the Zeeman slower.

Phillips is also a professor of physics, which is part of the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences at University of Maryland, College Park.

Phillips is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to &quot;reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill&quot; by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

He was one of the 35 Nobel laureates who signed a letter urging President Obama to provide a stable $15 billion per year support for clean energy research, technology and demonstration.

He is one of three well-known scientists and Methodist laity who have involved themselves in the religion and science dialogue. The other two scientists and fellow Methodists are chemist Charles Coulson and 1981 Nobel laureate Arthur Leonard Schawlow.

In October 2010, Phillips participated in the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s lunch with a laureate program where middle and high school students got to engage in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize-winning scientist over a brown-bag lunch. Phillips is also a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s advisory board.

Phillips has served as a member, and later as an associated member, on the Commission on Symbols, Units, Nomenclature, Atomic Masses and Fundamental Constants (C2) of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics from 2011 to 2024.

==Personal life==

Phillips married Jane Van Wynen shortly before he went to MIT. Neither had been regular churchgoers early in their marriage. However, in 1979, they joined the Fairhaven United Methodist Church in Gaithersburg, Maryland because they appreciated its diversity. He is a founding member of the International Society for Science and Religion. He and his wife have two daughters; Caitlin Phillips (born 1979) who founded Rebound Designs, and Christine Phillips (b 1981) who works in Science Communication.

During a seminar at the University of Maryland Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry titled &quot;Coherent Atoms in Optical Lattices&quot; Phillips stated, &quot;Rubidium is God&#x27;s gift to Bose–Einstein condensates.&quot;

<text>Robert Brydon Jones (; born 3 May 1965) is a Welsh actor, comedian, impressionist, presenter, singer and writer. He gained prominence for his roles in film, television and radio. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Birthday Honours in 2013 for services to comedy and broadcasting, and for charitable services.

Brydon gained fame for his roles in the black comedy series &quot;Human Remains&quot; (2000), the mockumentary series &quot;Marion and Geoff&quot; (2000–2003), the chat show spoof &quot;The Keith Barret Show&quot; (2004–2005), and the comedy series &quot;Supernova&quot; (2005–2006). From 2007 to 2024 he played Bryn West in the BBC sitcom &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; for which he received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Comedy Performance.

He has acted in a number of shows for the BBC with Steve Coogan starting with &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; (2002) and &quot;A Cock and Bull Story&quot; (2005). Brydon and Coogan then starred in &quot;The Trip&quot; (2010) followed by &quot;The Trip to Italy&quot; (2014), &quot;The Trip to Spain&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Trip to Greece&quot; (2020). He has also acted in the films &quot;Cinderella&quot; (2015), &quot;The Huntsman: Winter&#x27;s War&quot; (2016), &quot;Holmes &amp; Watson&quot; (2019) and &quot;Barbie&quot; (2023).

Since 2009, Brydon has presented the BBC One comedy panel show &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; after previously playing himself as host of a fictional panel show in &quot;Rob Brydon&#x27;s Annually Retentive&quot;, which ran on BBC Three from 2006 until 2007. In addition to presenting his own late-night chat show, &quot;The Rob Brydon Show&quot; for two years, he hosted the 2014 Saturday-night game show &quot;The Guess List&quot; for BBC One.

== Early life and education ==
Brydon was born on 3 May 1965 in Baglan, Glamorgan. His mother, Joy Jones (née Brydon), was a school teacher, and his father, Howard Jones, was a car dealer. He grew up in Baglan, with his younger brother Peter (born 1973).

Brydon was educated at two private schools: St. John&#x27;s School in Porthcawl, which Eddie Izzard also attended, and Dumbarton House School in Swansea until the age of 14. This was followed by Porthcawl Comprehensive School, where he met Ruth Jones (with whom he later worked in &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;) and became a member of the school&#x27;s youth theatre group. While at Dumbarton, he once stole the lunch money of fellow pupil Catherine Zeta-Jones (which he admitted while participating in a series 4 episode of &quot;Would I Lie To You?&quot;).

Brydon has said that his primary childhood influences in comedy were Barry Humphries, Frankie Howerd and Woody Allen. He has also said that he used to memorise entire sketches by Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Peter Sellers.

==Career==
=== 1982–1999: Early radio work === 
Brydon attended the Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama, Cardiff. He left after a year, to join Radio Wales at the age of 20. His early broadcasts included work as a disc jockey on BBC Radio Wales, when his Saturday morning shows included contributions from stand-up comedian Pete Park-Walker. Between 1992 and 1994, on Radio Wales (where he stayed for six years) he was the main presenter of &quot;Rave&quot;, one of BBC Radio 5&#x27;s youth magazine and music programmes, with Alan Thompson. He developed his &quot;Marion and Geoff&quot; story from this. In 1994 and 1995 Brydon appeared in numerous episodes of the original Radio Wales version of the cult comedy &quot;Satellite City&quot; with Boyd Clack. Although he has stayed with radio as a comedy performer on BBC Radio Five Live&#x27;s &quot;The Treatment&quot;, Brydon also does occasional stints as a stand-in presenter on BBC Radio 2 including for Ken Bruce before Bruce resigned from the BBC in 2023. Notably on 1 April 2011, Brydon appeared during Bruce&#x27;s absence, as him, as an April Fools&#x27; Day joke, for the entire show. 

During an episode of &quot;Would I Lie To You?&quot;, Brydon admitted that he had pretended on the phone to be his own agent, using one of his repertoire of different voices in the early part of his career. This was done to justify enhancing his freelance work fees.

For a brief period, in the early 1990s, Brydon was a presenter for the Home Shopping Network. He began to find small roles in several successful films and television series. Brydon was first known nationally as a voice artist. He provided several voices for the &quot;Discworld&quot; computer games, voicing the main character, Lewton, in the &quot;Discworld Noir&quot;, and also for radio and television programmes such as &quot;Eurotrash&quot;. He is also known for voice-over work in television advertising, including for Renault, Tango, &quot;The Times&quot;, Tesco, Abbey National, Sainsbury&#x27;s, McDonald&#x27;s, Pot Noodle, Domino&#x27;s Pizza, Crunchy Nut Cornflakes, &quot;The Observer&quot; and Fairy Liquid. He has also provided voices in animated films such as &quot;The Gruffalo&quot;, &quot;The Gruffalo&#x27;s Child&quot; and &quot;Room on the Broom&quot; and continuity announcements for BBC 1.

=== 2000–2009: Television roles and acclaim === 

In 2000 he made his mark in television comedy, with two series which he co-wrote and performed for the BBC: &quot;Human Remains,&quot; co-written by Julia Davis. From 2000 to 2003 he starred in the BBC television mockumentary &quot;Marion and Geoff&quot; which was commercially successful. Brydon plays as Keith Barret, a naïve taxi driver going through a messy divorce from his wife, Marion, who, though he fails to realise it, has had a long-standing affair with her colleague, Geoff. Each episode is presented as a monologue, filmed by a fixed camera in the confines of his car. From 2004 to 2005 Brydon starred in &quot;The Keith Barret Show&quot; which was a fictional spoof of a BBC chat show. In 2006 he parodied comedy panel shows such as &quot;QI&quot;, &quot;Mock the Week&quot; and &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot; in the BBC Three series &quot;Rob Brydon&#x27;s Annually Retentive&quot;. Ed Potton of &quot;The Times&quot; found that the series &quot;provides the perfect platform for host Brydon, playing a demonic version of himself, to mimic (often hilariously) and abuse (often brutally) his guests&quot;. 

In 2005 he portrayed a version of himself in the British comedy &quot;A Cock and Bull Story&quot; directed by Michael Winterbottom. Brydon starred opposite Steve Coogan. Dana Stevens of &quot;Slate&quot; wrote, &quot;Rob Brydon, plays Tristram’s Uncle Toby, a blustering war veteran with a wound in an unspeakable place. In the modern-day scenes, Rob Brydon is, surprise, Rob Brydon, an actor with an ego even more pitifully in need of stroking than Coogan’s. The unscripted-sounding exchanges between these two are the funniest part of the movie&quot;. From 2007 to 2010 Brydon gained prominence for his leading role as Uncle Bryn in the BBC sitcom &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; starring Matthew Horne, Joanna Page, and James Corden. In the 2009 Brydon was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Comedy Performance as Bryn. Starting in 2009 Brydon has hosted the game show &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;. Since these series Brydon has developed a career path as a character actor, in both comedic and serious roles. He portrayed controversial theatre critic Kenneth Tynan in the BBC Four film &quot;Kenneth Tynan: In Praise of Hardcore&quot; (2005), opposite Julian Sands as Laurence Olivier. 

Also in 2006, Brydon first appeared on the BBC Radio 4 comedy panel game &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;. His singing voice earned the unprecedented accolade from the former host, Humphrey Lyttelton, of being &quot;not bad&quot;. When the team went on a tour of non-broadcast stage shows, Brydon filled in as chairman when Lyttelton was in hospital to repair an aortic aneurysm. Lyttelton died in hospital after surgery. Brydon narrated a two-part programme on BBC Radio 4, &quot;The Pain of Laughter: The Last Days of Kenneth Williams&quot;. It explored the latter part of Williams&#x27;s life, featuring many of the performer&#x27;s friends and contemporaries. In other radio work Brydon sat in for Ken Bruce on BBC Radio 2 for one day only on 25 August 2008. In addition to this, on 1 April 2011, Brydon impersonated Bruce for the entire two-hour and thirty minutes show. Bruce came on the air at the end of the show to reveal the prank. Brydon has appeared on the TV comedy quiz &quot;QI&quot;. In his first appearance (Series A, episode 5), his talent for mimicry was displayed with impressions of Alec Guinness, James Dean, and Michael J. Fox. In the 2008 Christmas special, he provided impressions of Richard Burton and Tom Jones.

His character Bryn West in &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;, written by Ruth Jones and James Corden, allowed him to return to his South Wales roots. In this role Brydon performed the 2009 Comic Relief charity single, &quot;(Barry) Islands in the Stream&quot;, with Ruth Jones (both actors appearing as their characters from &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;) and singer Tom Jones. It reached No.1 in the UK Singles Chart on 15 March 2009. In February 2009, it was announced that Brydon would be one of three people to replace Lyttelton as chairman of the 51st series of &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; (the others being Stephen Fry and Jack Dee). Brydon also appeared as guest panellist in the first two episodes of series 52, chaired by Jack Dee. He returned as a guest panellist in the last two episodes of series 54 in January 2011. Additionally, in 2009 he took over as host of &quot;Would I Lie To You?&quot;, replacing Angus Deayton. Brydon had also appeared as a guest panellist on the show during the previous season. Brydon has presented an episode of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; and has appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s panel game &quot;Just a Minute&quot;.

=== 2010–present: &quot;The Trip&quot; and other roles === 

Between September and October 2011, Brydon starred alongside Kenneth Branagh in Francis Veber&#x27;s play &quot;The Painkiller&quot; at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast. He reprised his role with Branagh, in March and April 2016, at the Garrick Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. Whilst not calling himself an impressionist, Brydon says he &quot;started out as an impressionist&quot; but will &quot;bristle&quot; when described as such. His impressions include Alec Guinness, James Dean, Michael J. Fox, Richard Burton, Tom Jones, Michael Caine, Mick Jagger and Ronnie Corbett. He is also noted for his &quot;Small Man in A Box&quot; impression.

In 2010 Brydon starred alongside Steve Coogan in Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s partially improvised BBC Two sitcom series &quot;The Trip,&quot; in which both actors played fictionalised versions of their public personas (Brydon, optimistic and always eager to do an impression; and Coogan, misanthropic and bitter that he&#x27;s not the major international star he believes he should be). Coogan and Brydon reprised their roles as themselves in the follow up films &quot;The Trip to Italy&quot; (2014), &quot;The Trip to Spain&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Trip to Greece&quot; (2020). The films have been met with critical acclaim with many critics describing them as &quot;hilarious and heartbreaking&quot;. Elizabeth Nelson of &quot;The Ringer&quot; comparing their chemistry to that of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in the Road movies. Nelson also compared the films to Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;. 

Brydon&#x27;s book &quot;Small Man in a Book&quot; (the title a play on his &quot;small-man-in-a-box&quot; impression) was published in November 2011. In 2009/10 Brydon had his first stand-up tour in the UK as Rob Brydon (rather than as a differently named character). The resulting DVD of the 2009/10 show, &quot;Rob Brydon: Live&quot;, was released on 23 November 2009. Brydon appeared as a host on episode two of series five of the BBC series of &quot;Live at the Apollo&quot;. In 2010 Brydon took part in &quot;Channel 4&#x27;s Comedy Gala&quot;, a benefit show in aid of Great Ormond Street Children&#x27;s Hospital, filmed live at the O2 Arena in London on 30 March. He was one of six compères for the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Concert held outside Buckingham Palace on 4 June 2012. The following year he dubbed the voice of Beto in the animated film &quot;The Unbeatables&quot; for the &quot;United Kingdom&quot; edition of the film.

In 2015 he had a uncredited role as Master Phineus in the Kenneth Branagh directed romantic fantasy &quot;Cinderella&quot; for Walt Disney Pictures. The following year he played Gryff in &quot;The Huntsman: Winter&#x27;s War&quot; (2016) alongside Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth and Emily Blunt. That same year he played various roles in the BBC One animated series &quot;Revolting Rhymes&quot; (2016) which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. In 2018 he played Inspector Lestrade in the mystery-parody &quot;Holmes &amp; Watson&quot; starring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. Brydon also had roles in the stop-motion animated film &quot;Early Man&quot; (2018) and the British comedy &quot;Swimming with Men&quot; (2018). He also portrayed Richard Nixon in the FX series &quot;Trust&quot; (2018). The following year he had roles in the musical comedy &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; (2019) and in the coming-of-age film &quot;Days of the Bagnold Summer&quot; (2019). 

In 2021 he acted in the first episode of the second series of the show &quot;McDonald &amp; Dodds&quot;. That same year he narrated &quot;The Chasers Road Trip: Trains, Brains and Automobiles&quot;, was a contestant on &quot;Celebrity Catchphrase&quot;, and voiced The Crow in &quot;Superworm&quot; alongside Olivia Colman and Matt Smith. The following year he voiced the Pied Piper in &quot;The Amazing Maurice&quot; (2022) alongside Hugh Laurie, Emilia Clarke, David Thewlis and Hugh Bonneville. In 2023 he had a brief role as Sugar Daddy Ken in Greta Gerwig&#x27;s comedy &quot;Barbie&quot; starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.

In 2022 Brydon appeared in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Old Friends&quot; revue, including alongside Haydn Gwynne in &quot;The Little Things You Do Together&quot;, the marital battle from &quot;Company&quot;.

==Personal life==
Brydon was married to Martina Fitchie from 1992 to 2000. They had two daughters and a son.

On 6 October 2006, Brydon married Clare Holland, a former producer on &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;, at the church of St John the Baptist in Windsor, Berkshire. They live in Strawberry Hill in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. They have two sons.

A Swansea City football fan, Brydon is an ambassador to the club&#x27;s 1912 foundation. He is also a supporter of Harlequins rugby union club. In May 2013 he competed for Wales, alongside Craig Bellamy, in a Celebrity Golf tournament at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport.

In August 2014, Brydon was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.

<text>al-Muʿtamid Muḥammad ibn ʿAbbād [[Lakhmids|al-Lakhmī]] (; reigned c. 1069–1091, lived 1040–1095), also known as Abbad III, was the third and last ruler of the Taifa of Seville in Al-Andalus, as well as a renowned poet. He was the final ruler of the Arab Abbadid dynasty of Seville, before being deposed by the Almoravids in 1091.

== Early life ==
When he was 13 years old, Al-Mu&#x27;tamid&#x27;s father bestowed on him the title of Emir and appointed the Andalusi Arabic poet Ibn Ammar as his vizier. However, Al-Mu&#x27;tamid fell strongly under the influence of Ibn Ammar. Al-Mu’tamid&#x27;s father was wary of Ibn Ammar and the influence he had, ultimately sending him into exile.

== Reign ==
After the death of his father Abbad II al-Mu&#x27;tadid in 1069, Al-Mu&#x27;tamid inherited Seville as caliph. One of his first acts was to recall Ibn Ammar and to bestow military honours and high political offices on him, including as Governor of Silves and Prime Minister of the government in Seville. This reconciliation would later be rebuked for unknown reasons.

More likely the cause of resentment grew from the fact that the Prime Minister had let al-Mu&#x27;tamid&#x27;s son, Prince al-Rasid, be captured and held hostage during a military campaign. He had also declared himself Emir of Murcia without properly acknowledging the rights of his own sovereign. The two men exchanged verses full of bitter criticisms and accusations. Murcia was subsequently lost and Ibn Ammar himself taken hostage. A final attempt to conspire with the young prince against his father proved too much for al-Mu&#x27;tamid, who &quot;fell into a rage and hacked him to death with his own hands&quot;. After Ibn Ammar&#x27;s death, the caliph was reported to have grieved bitterly and gave his former friend a sumptuous funeral.

Large parts of al-Andalus were under the dominion of al-Mu&#x27;tamid: to the west his territory encompassed the land between the lower Guadalquivir and Guadiana, plus the areas around Niebla, Huelva and Saltes. In the south it extended to Morón, Arcos, Ronda, and also Algeciras and Tarifa. The capital, Córdoba, was taken in 1070, lost in 1075, and regained in 1078.

Nevertheless, the family was still subject to taxation by the King of Castile, to whom they were vassals. The drain of these taxes effectively weakened the kingdom&#x27;s power: al-Mu&#x27;tamid&#x27;s decision to stop paying these taxes caused King Alfonso VI of Castile (who had already conquered Toledo in 1085) to besiege Seville. Al-Mu&#x27;tamid asked help from the Berber Almoravids of Morocco against the Castilian king. Al-Mu&#x27;tamid supported the Almoravid ruler Yusuf ibn Tashfin against Alfonso in the Battle of Sagrajas in 1086. The Almoravids established themselves at Algeciras and, after defeating the Christians, occupied all the Islamic taifas, including Seville itself in 1091. After they ravaged the city, al-Mu&#x27;tamid ordered his sons to surrender the royal fortress (the early Alcázar of Seville) in order to save their lives. When his son, Rashid, had advised him not to call on Yusuf ibn Tashfin, Al-Mu&#x27;tamid had rebuffed him:

In 1091, Al-Mu&#x27;tamid was taken into captivity by the Almoravids and exiled to Aghmat, Morocco, where he died (or was perhaps assassinated) in 1095. His grave is located in the outskirts of Aghmat.

== Legacy ==

Al-Mu&#x27;tamid, one of the most eminent men of 11th-century al-Andalus, was highly regarded as a writer of poetry in Arabic. He was the father-in-law or father of Zaida of Seville, a concubine of Alfonso VI of Castile, possibly identical to his later wife, Queen Isabella. Iberian Muslim sources say that Zaida of Seville was the wife of Al-Mu&#x27;tamid&#x27;s son Abu Nasr al-Fath al-Ma&#x27;mūn, Emir of the Taifa of Córdoba. Bishop Pelayo of Oviedo asserted that Zaida was the daughter of &quot;Abenath&quot; (Al-Mu&#x27;tamid ibn Abbad), a claim repeated by later Iberian Christian chroniclers that persisted in written histories for hundreds of years. However, the Islamic chroniclers are considered more reliable, and the general consensus among scholars now is that Zaida was Al-Mu&#x27;tamid&#x27;s daughter-in-law.

<doc id="630851" wikidata="Q3851652" url="?curid=630851" title="Breast augmentation">
<text>Breast augmentation and augmentation mammoplasty is a cosmetic surgery procedure, which uses breast-implants and/ or fat-graft mammoplasty technique to increase the size, change the shape, and alter the texture of the breasts. Although in some cases augmentation mammoplasty is applied to correct congenital defects of the breasts and the chest wall in other cases it is performed purely for cosmetic reasons.

The surgical implantation approach creates a spherical augmentation of the breast hemisphere, using a breast implant filled with either saline solution or silicone gel; the fat-graft transfer approach augments the size and corrects contour defects of the breast hemisphere with grafts of the adipocyte fat tissue, drawn from the person&#x27;s body.

In a breast reconstruction procedure, a tissue expander (a temporary breast implant device) is sometimes put in place and inflated with saline to prepare (shape and enlarge) the recipient site (implant pocket) to receive and accommodate the breast implant prosthesis.

In most instances of fat-graft breast augmentation, the increase is of modest volume, usually only one bra cup size or less, which is thought to be the physiological limit allowed by the metabolism of the human body.

==Surgical breast augmentation==

===Breast implants===
There are four types of implants:

# Saline implants filled with sterile saline solution.
# Silicone implants filled with viscous silicone gel.
# Alternative-composition implants (no longer manufactured), filled with various fillers such as soy oil or polypropylene string.
# &quot;Structured&quot; implants using nested elastomer silicone shells with saline between the shells.

====Saline breast implant====
The saline breast implant, filled with saline solution, was first manufactured by the Laboratoires Arion company, in France, and introduced for use as a prosthetic medical device in 1964. Modern-day versions of saline breast implants are manufactured with thicker, room-temperature vulcanized (RTV) shells made of a silicone elastomer. The study &quot;In vitro Deflation of Pre-filled Saline Breast Implants&quot; (2006) reported that the rates of deflation (filler leakage) of the pre-filled saline breast implant made it a second-choice prosthesis for &quot;corrective breast surgery&quot;. Nonetheless, in the 1990s, the saline breast implant was mandated to be the prosthesis usual for breast augmentation surgery, the result of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#x27;s (FDA) temporary restriction against the importation of silicone-filled breast implants.

The technical goal of the saline-implant technique was a less-invasive surgical technique, by inserting an empty, rolled-up breast implant through a smaller surgical incision. In surgical practice, after having installed the empty breast implants in the implant pockets, the plastic surgeon would then fill each device with saline solution through a one-way valve and, because the required insertion incisions were short and small, the resultant incision scars would be smaller and shorter than the surgical scars typical of the pre-filled, silicone-gel implant surgical technique.

When compared with the results achieved with a silicone-gel breast implant, the saline implant can yield &quot;good-to-excellent&quot; results of increased breast size, a smoother hemisphere contour, and realistic consistency; yet it is likelier to cause cosmetic problems, such as the rippling and the wrinkling of the breast-envelope skin, and technical problems, such as the implant&#x27;s presence being noticeable to the eye and to the touch. The occurrence of such cosmetic problems is likelier in the case of a person with very little breast tissue; in the case of a person who requires post-mastectomy breast reconstruction, the silicone-gel implant is the technically superior prosthetic device for breast reconstruction. In the case of a person with much breast tissue, for whom sub-muscular placement is the recommended surgical approach, saline breast implants can give an aesthetic result much like that produced by silicone breast implants: an appearance of proportionate breast size, smooth contour, and realistic consistency.

====Silicone-gel breast implant====
The modern prosthetic breast was invented in 1961, by the American plastic surgeons Thomas Cronin and Frank Gerow, and manufactured by the Dow Corning Corporation; in due course, the first augmentation mammoplasty was performed in 1962. There are five generations of medical device technology for the breast-implant models filled with silicone gel; each generation of breast prosthesis is defined by common model-manufacturing techniques.

====First generation====

The Cronin–Gerow implant, prosthesis model 1963, was a silicone rubber envelope-sack, shaped like a teardrop, which was filled with viscous silicone-gel. To reduce the rotation of the emplaced breast-implant upon the chest wall, the model 1963 prosthesis was affixed to the implant pocket with a fastener-patch, made of Dacron material (polyethylene terephthalate), which was attached to the rear of the breast implant shell.

====Second generation====

In the 1970s, manufacturers offered the second generation of breast implant prostheses
* The first developments were a thinner-gauge implant shell, and a filler gel of low-cohesion silicone, which made the devices more functional and realistic (size, appearance, and consistency). Yet, in clinical practice, second-generation breast implants proved fragile, with greater rates of shell rupture and filler leakage (&quot;silicone-gel bleed&quot;) through the &quot;intact device&#x27;s shell. The consequences, plus increased rates of capsular contracture, precipitated faulty product class action-lawsuits by the U.S. government against the Dow Corning Corporation and other manufacturers of breast prostheses.
* The second technological development was a polyurethane foam coating for the shell of the implant; the coating reduced the degree of capsular contracture by causing an inflammatory reaction that impeded the formation of a capsule of fibrous collagen tissue around the coated device. Nevertheless, despite the intentions behind the polyurethane foam coating, the medical use of polyurethane-coated breast implants was briefly discontinued due to the potential health risk posed by 2,4-toluene diamine (TDA), a carcinogenic by-product of the chemical breakdown of the polyurethane foam coating of the breast implant. After reviewing the medical data, the FDA concluded that TDA-induced breast cancer was an infinitesimal health risk to anyone with breast implants, and did not justify legally requiring physicians to explain the matter to their patients. Ultimately, polyurethane-coated breast implants remain in plastic surgery practice in Europe and in South America; no manufacturer has sought FDA approval for medical sales of such breast implants in the U.S.
* The third technological development was the double-lumen breast implant, a double-cavity prosthesis composed of a silicone breast implant contained within a saline breast implant. The two-fold, technical goal was: (i) the cosmetic benefits of silicone gel (the inner lumen) enclosed in saline solution (the outer lumen); and (ii) a breast implant whose volume is post-operatively adjustable. unfortunately, the more complex design of the double-lumen breast implant had a device-failure rate greater than that of single-lumen breast implants. This style of implant, in modern times, is primarily used for breast reconstruction.

====Third and fourth generations====

In the 1980s, the third- and fourth-generation implants were stepwise advances in manufacturing technology, such as elastomer-coated shells that decreased gel bleed (filler leakage), and a thicker, increased-cohesion filler gel. The manufacturers of implantable breast prostheses then designed and made anatomic models (like the natural breast) and &quot;shaped&quot; models, which realistically corresponded with the breast and body types of actual women. The tapered models of breast implants have a uniformly textured surface, to reduce rotation of the prosthesis within the implant pocket; round models of breast implants are available in both smooth-surface and textured-surface models, as rotation is not an issue.

====Fifth generation====

Since the mid-1990s, the fifth generation of silicone gel breast implants is made of a semi-solid gel, which mostly eliminates the occurrences of filler leakage (&quot;silicone-gel bleed&quot;) and of the migration of the silicone filler from the implant-pocket to other areas of the person&#x27;s body. The studies &quot;Experience with Anatomical Soft Cohesive Silicone gel Prosthesis in Cosmetic and Reconstructive Breast Implant Surgery&quot; (2004) and &quot;Cohesive Silicone gel Breast Implants in Aesthetic and Reconstructive Breast Surgery&quot; (2005) reported relatively lower rates of capsular contracture and of device-shell rupture, and relatively greater rates of &quot;medical safety&quot; and &quot;technical efficacy&quot; than those of early-generation breast implants.

====Alternative-composition implants====

Saline and silicone gel are the most common types of breast implant used in the world today. Alternative-composition implants have largely been discontinued. These implants featured fillers such as soy oil and polypropylene string. Other discontinued materials include ox cartilage, Terylene &quot;wool&quot;, ground rubber, silastic rubber, and Teflon-silicone prostheses.

====&quot;Structured&quot; implants====

Structured implants were approved by the FDA and Health Canada in 2014 as a fourth category of breast implant. These implants incorporate both saline and silicone gel implant technology. The filler is saline solution, in case of rupture, and has a natural feel, like silicone gel implants. This implant type uses an internal structure consisting of three nested silicone rubber &quot;shells&quot; that support the upper half of the breast, with the two spaces between the three shells filled with saline. The implant is inserted, empty, then filled once in place, which requires a smaller incision than a pre-filled implant.

===Implants and breastfeeding===
The breasts are apocrine glands which produce milk for the feeding of infant children,

====Breast implant toxicity====
Digestive tract contamination and systemic toxicity due to the leakage of breast implant filler to the breast milk are the principal infant health concerns with breast implants. Breast implant fillers are biologically inert: silicone filler is indigestible and saline filler is mostly salt and water. Each of these substances should be chemically inert and present in the environment. Moreover, &quot;proponent&quot; physicians have stated that there &quot;should be no absolute contraindication to breast-feeding by women with silicone breast implants.&quot; In the early 1990s, at the beginning of the silicone gel breast implant illness panic, small-scale, non-randomized studies indicated possible breast-feeding complications from silicone implants; no one study was able to demonstrate disease causality due to implants.

====Impediments to breastfeeding====

A person with breast implants is usually able to breastfeed an infant; yet implants can cause functional breastfeeding difficulties, especially with mammoplasty procedures that involve cutting around the areola, and implant placement directly beneath the breast, which tend to cause greater breast-feeding difficulties. Patients are advised to select a procedure that causes the least damage to the lactiferous ducts and the nerves of the nipple-areola complex (NAC).

Functional breastfeeding difficulties arise if the surgeon cuts the milk ducts, the major nerves innervating the breast, or if the milk glands are otherwise damaged. Some surgical approaches, including IMF (inframammary fold), TABA (trans-axillary breast augmentation), and TUBA (trans-umbilical breast augmentation), avoid the tissue of the nipple-areola complex; if the person is concerned about possible breast-feeding difficulties, the periareolar incisions can sometimes be made so as to reduce damage to the milk ducts and to the nerves of the NAC. The milk glands are affected most by subglandular implants (under the gland) and large-sized breast implants, which pinch the lactiferous ducts and impede milk flow. Small-sized breast implants, and submuscular implantation, cause fewer breast function problems; however, some women have managed to successfully breastfeed after undergoing periareolar incisions and subglandular emplacement.

==The person==
===Psychology===
The studies &quot;Body Image Concerns of Breast Augmentation Patients&quot; (2003) and &quot;Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Cosmetic Surgery&quot; (2006) reported that the woman who underwent breast augmentation surgery also had undergone psychotherapy, had low self-esteem, presented frequent occurrences of psychological depression, had attempted suicide, and had body dysmorphiaa type of mental illness wherein she perceives non-existent physical defects. Post-operative patient surveys about the mental health and the quality of life of the women, reported improved physical health, physical appearance, social life, self-confidence, self-esteem, and satisfaction sexual functioning. Furthermore, most of the women reported long-term satisfaction with their breast implants; some despite having had medical complications that required surgical revision, either corrective or aesthetic. Likewise, in Denmark, 8.0 percent of breast augmentation patients had a pre-operative history of psychiatric hospitalization.

===Women bodybuilders===

The Cosmeticsurgery.com article &quot;They Need Bosoms, tooWomen Weight Lifters&quot; (2013) reported that women weight-lifters have resorted to breast augmentation surgery to maintain a feminine physique, and so compensate for the loss of breast mass consequent to the increased lean-body mass and decreased body-fat consequent to lifting weights.

===Mental health===
The longitudinal study &quot;Excess Mortality from Suicide and other External Causes of Death Among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants&quot; (2007), reported that women who sought breast implants are almost 3.0 times as likely to commit suicide as are women who have not sought breast implants. Compared to the standard suicide-rate for women of the general populace, the suicide-rate for women with augmented breasts remained alike until 10-years post-implantation, yet it increased to 4.5 times greater at the 11-year mark, and so remained until the 19-year mark, when it increased to 6.0 times greater at 20-years post-implantation. Moreover, additional to the suicide risk, women with breast implants also faced a trebled death risk from alcoholism and drugs abuse (prescription and recreational). Although seven studies have statistically connected a woman&#x27;s undergoing a breast augmentation procedure to a greater suicide rate, the research indicates that augmentation surgery does not increase the suicide rate; and that, in the first instance, it is the psychopathologically inclined woman who is likelier to undergo breast augmentation.

Moreover, the study &quot;Effect of Breast Augmentation Mammoplasty on Self-Esteem and Sexuality: A Quantitative Analysis&quot; (2007), reported that the women attributed their improved self-esteem, self-image, and increased, satisfactory sexual functioning to having undergone breast augmentation; the cohort, aged 21–57 years, averaged post-operative self-esteem increases ranging from 20.7 to 24.9 points on the 30-point Rosenberg self-esteem scale, which data supported the 78.6 percent increase in the woman&#x27;s libido, relative to her pre-operative level of libido. Therefore, before agreeing to any surgical procedure, the plastic surgeon evaluates and considers the woman&#x27;s mental health to determine if breast implants can positively affect her self-esteem and sexual functioning.

==Surgical procedures==

===Indications===
An augmentation mammoplasty for emplacing breast implants has three therapeutic purposes:

# Primary reconstruction: to replace breast tissues damaged by trauma (blunt, penetrating, blast), disease (breast cancer), and failed anatomic development (tuberous breast deformity).
# Revision and reconstruction: to revise (correct) the outcome of a previous breast reconstruction surgery.
# Primary augmentation: to aesthetically augment the size, form, and feel of the breasts.

The operating room time of post–mastectomy breast reconstruction, and of breast augmentation surgery is determined by the emplacement procedure employed, the type of incisional technique, the breast implant (type and materials), and the pectoral locale of the implant pocket.

===Incision types===
The emplacement of a breast implant device is performed with five types of surgical incisions:

# Inframammary: an incision made below the breast, in the inframammary fold (IMF), which affords maximal access for precise dissection and emplacement of the breast implant devices. It is the preferred surgical technique for emplacing silicone-gel implants, because of the longer incisions required; yet, IMF implantation can produce thicker, slightly more visible surgical scars.
# Periareolar: an incision made along the areolar periphery (border), which provides an optimal approach when adjustments to the IMF position are required, or when a mastopexy (breast lift) is included to the primary mammoplasty procedure. In the periareolar emplacement method, the incision is around the medial-half (inferior half) of the areola&#x27;s circumference. Silicone-gel implants can be difficult to emplace with this incision, because of the short, five-centimetre length (~ 5.0 cm.) of the required access-incision. Aesthetically, because the scars are at the areola&#x27;s border, they usually are less visible than the IMF-incision scars of women with light-pigment areolae. Furthermore, periareolar implantation produces a greater incidence of capsular contracture, severs the milk ducts and the nerves to the nipple, thus causes the most post-operative functional problems, e.g. impeded breastfeeding.
# Transaxillary: an incision made to the axilla (armpit), from which the dissection tunnels medially, thus allows emplacing the implants without producing visible scars upon the breast proper; yet is likelier to produce inferior asymmetry of the implant-device position. Therefore, surgical revision of transaxillary emplaced breast implants usually requires either an IMF incision or a periareolar incision. Transaxillary emplacement can be performed bluntly or with an endoscope (illuminated video microcamera).
# Transumbilical: a trans-umbilical breast augmentation (TUBA) is a less common implant-device insertion technique wherein the incision is at the navel, and the dissection tunnels superiorly. This surgical approach enables emplacing the breast implants without producing visible scars upon the breast; but it makes appropriate dissection and device-emplacement more technically difficult. A TUBA procedure is performed bluntlywithout the endoscope&#x27;s visual assistanceand is not appropriate for emplacing (pre-filled) silicone-gel implants, because of the great potential for damaging the elastomer silicone shell of the breast-implant device during its manual insertion through the shorttwo-centimetre (~2.0 cm.)incision at the navel, and because pre-filled silicone-gel implants are incompressible, and cannot be inserted through so small an incision.
# Transabdominalas in the TUBA procedure, in the transabdominoplasty breast augmentation (TABA), the breast implants are tunneled superiorly from the abdominal incision into bluntly dissected implant pockets, while the patient simultaneously undergoes an abdominoplasty.

===Implant pocket placement===
The four surgical approaches to emplacing a breast implant to the implant pocket are described in anatomical relation to the pectoralis major muscle.

# SubglandularThe breast implant is emplaced to the retromammary space, between the breast tissue (the mammary gland) and the pectoralis major muscle (major muscle of the chest), which most approximates the plane of normal breast tissue, and affords the most aesthetic results. Yet, in women with thin pectoral soft-tissue, the subglandular position is likelier to show the ripples and wrinkles of the underlying implant. Moreover, the capsular contracture incidence rate is slightly greater with subglandular implantation.
# SubfascialThe breast implant is emplaced beneath the fascia of the pectoralis major muscle; the subfascial position is a variant of the subglandular position for the breast implant. The technical advantages of the subfascial implant-pocket technique are debated; proponent surgeons report that the layer of fascial tissue provides greater implant coverage and better sustains its position.
# Subpectoral (dual plane)The breast implant is inserted beneath the pectoralis major muscle, after the surgeon releases the inferior muscular attachments, with or without partial dissection of the subglandular plane. Resultantly, the upper half of the implant is partially beneath the pectoralis major muscle, while the lower half of the implant is in the subglandular plane. This implantation technique achieves maximal coverage of the upper half of the implant, while allowing the expansion of the implant&#x27;s lower half; however, &quot;animation deformity&quot;, the movement of the implants in the subpectoral plane can be excessive for some patients.
# SubmuscularThe breast implant is emplaced beneath the pectoralis major muscle, without releasing the inferior origin of the muscle proper. Total muscular coverage of the implant can be achieved by releasing the lateral muscles of the chest walleither the serratus muscle or the pectoralis minor muscle, or bothand suturing it, or them, to the pectoralis major muscle. In breast reconstruction surgery, the submuscular implantation approach effects maximal coverage of the breast implants.

===Post-surgical recovery===
The surgical scars of a breast augmentation mammoplasty heal at 6-weeks post-operative, and fade within several months, according to the skin type of the woman. Depending upon the daily physical activity the woman might require, the augmentation mammoplasty patient usually resumes her normal life activities at about 1-week post-operative. The woman who underwent submuscular implantation (beneath the pectoralis major muscles) usually has a longer post–operative convalescence, and experiences more pain, because of the healing of the deep-tissue cuts into the chest muscles for the breast augmentation. The patient usually does not exercise or engage in strenuous physical activities for about six weeks. Moreover, during the initial convalescence, the patient is encouraged to regularly exercise (flex and move) her arms to alleviate pain and discomfort; and, as required, analgesic medication catheters for alleviating pain.

===Medical complications===
The plastic surgical emplacement of breast-implant devices, either for breast reconstruction or for aesthetic purpose, presents the same health risks common to surgery, such as adverse reaction to anesthesia, hematoma (post-operative bleeding), seroma (fluid accumulation), incision-site breakdown (wound infection). Complications specific to breast augmentation include breast pain, altered sensation, impeded breast-feeding function, visible wrinkling, asymmetry, thinning of the breast tissue, and symmastia, the &quot;bread loafing&quot; of the bust that interrupts the natural plane between the breasts. Specific treatments for the complications of indwelling breast implantscapsular contracture and capsular ruptureare periodic MRI monitoring and physical examinations. Furthermore, complications and re-operations related to the implantation surgery, and to tissue expanders (implant placeholders during surgery) can cause unfavorable scarring in approximately 6–7% of the patients.
 Statistically, 20% of women who underwent cosmetic implantation, and 50% of women who underwent breast reconstruction implantation, required their explantation at the 10-year mark. In 2019, a direct link was identified between Allergan BIOCELL textured breast implants of Allergan and the breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a cancer of the immune system. FDA recalled all Allergan BIOCELL implants.

===Implant rupture===
Because a breast implant is a Class III medical device of limited product-life, the principal rupture-rate factors are its age and design; Nonetheless, a breast implant device can retain its mechanical integrity for decades in a woman&#x27;s body. When a saline breast implant ruptures, leaks, and empties, it quickly deflates, and thus can be readily explanted (surgically removed). The follow-up report, &quot;Natrelle Saline-filled Breast Implants: a Prospective 10-year Study&quot; (2009) indicated rupture-deflation rates of 3–5 percent at 3-years post-implantation, and 7–10 percent rupture-deflation rates at 10-years post-implantation. In a study of his 4761 augmentation mammaplasty patients, Eisenberg reported that overfilling saline breast implants 10-13% significantly reduced the rupture-deflation rate to 1.83% at 8-years post-implantation.

When a silicone breast implant ruptures it usually does not deflate, yet the filler gel does leak from it, which can migrate to the implant pocket; therefore, an intracapsular rupture (in-capsule leak) can become an extracapsular rupture (out-of-capsule leak), and each occurrence is resolved by explantation. Although the leaked silicone filler-gel can migrate from the chest tissues to elsewhere in the woman&#x27;s body, most clinical complications are limited to the breast and armpit areas, usually manifested as granulomas (inflammatory nodules) and axillary lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph glands in the armpit area).

; The suspected mechanisms of breast implant rupture:

* Damage during implantation
* Damage during (other) surgical procedures
* Chemical degradation of the breast implant shell
* Trauma (blunt trauma, penetrating trauma or blast trauma)
* Mechanical pressure of traditional mammographic breast examination 

Silicone implant rupture can be evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging; from the long-term MRI data for single-lumen breast implants, the European literature about second generation silicone-gel breast implants (1970s design), reported silent device-rupture rates of 8–15 percent at 10-years post-implantation (15–30% of the patients).

The study &quot;Safety and Effectiveness of Mentor&#x27;s MemoryGel Implants at 6 Years&quot; (2009), which was a branch study of the U.S. FDA&#x27;s core clinical trials for primary breast augmentation surgery patients, reported low device-rupture rates of 1.1 percent at 6-years post-implantation. The first series of MRI evaluations of the silicone breast implants with thick filler-gel reported a device-rupture rate of 1.0 percent, or less, at the median 6-year device-age. Statistically, the manual examination (palpation) of the woman is inadequate for accurately evaluating if a breast implant has ruptured. The study, &quot;The Diagnosis of Silicone Breast-implant Rupture: Clinical Findings Compared with Findings at Magnetic Resonance Imaging&quot; (2005), reported that, in asymptomatic patients, only 30 percent of the ruptured breast implants is accurately palpated and detected by an experienced plastic surgeon, whereas MRI examinations accurately detected 86 percent of breast-implant ruptures. Therefore, the U.S. FDA recommended scheduled MRI examinations, as silent-rupture screenings, beginning at the 3-year-mark post-implantation, and then every two years, thereafter. Nonetheless, beyond the U.S., the medical establishments of other nations have not endorsed routine MRI screening, and, in its stead, proposed that such a radiologic examination be reserved for two purposes: (i) for the woman with a suspected breast-implant rupture; and (ii) for the confirmation of mammographic and ultrasonic studies that indicate the presence of a ruptured breast implant.

Furthermore, &quot;The Effect of Study design Biases on the Diagnostic Accuracy of Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Detecting Silicone Breast Implant Ruptures: a Meta-analysis&quot; (2011) reported that the breast-screening MRIs of asymptomatic women might overestimate the incidence of breast-implant rupture. In the event, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration emphasised that &quot;breast implants are not lifetime devices. The longer a woman has silicone gel-filled breast implants, the more likely she is to experience complications.&quot;

When one lumen of a structured implant ruptures, it leaks and empties. The other lumen remain intact and the implant only partially deflates, allowing for ease of explant and replacement.

===Capsular contracture===

The human body&#x27;s immune response to a surgically installed foreign objectbreast implant, cardiac pacemaker, orthopedic prosthesisis to encapsulate it with scar tissue capsules of tightly woven collagen fibers, in order to maintain the integrity of the body by isolating the foreign object, and so tolerate its presence. Capsular contracturewhich should be distinguished from normal capsular tissueoccurs when the collagen-fiber capsule thickens and compresses the breast implant; it is a painful complication that might distort either the breast implant, or the breast, or both.

The cause of capsular contracture is unknown, but the common incidence factors include bacterial contamination, device-shell rupture, filler leakage, and hematoma. The surgical implantation procedures that have reduced the incidence of capsular contracture include submuscular emplacement, the use of breast implants with a textured surface (polyurethane-coated); limited pre-operative handling of the implants, limited contact with the chest skin of the implant pocket before the emplacement of the breast implant, and irrigation of the recipient site with triple-antibiotic solutions. The use of a funnel device for implant insertion has also been shown to reduce the rate of capsular contracture.

The correction of capsular contracture might require an open capsulotomy (surgical release) of the collagen-fiber capsule, or the removal, and possible replacement, of the breast implant. Furthermore, in treating capsular contracture, the closed capsulotomy (disruption via external manipulation) once was a common maneuver for treating hard capsules, but now is a discouraged technique, because it can rupture the breast implant. Non-surgical treatments for collagen-fiber capsules include massage, external ultrasonic therapy, leukotriene pathway inhibitors such as zafirlukast (Accolate) or montelukast (Singulair), and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMFT).

====Repair and revision surgeries====
When the woman is unsatisfied with the outcome of the augmentation mammoplasty; or when technical or medical complications occur; or because of the breast implants&#x27; limited product life (Class III medical device, in the U.S.), it is likely she might require replacing the breast implants. The common revision surgery indications include major and minor medical complications, capsular contracture, shell rupture, and device deflation. Revision incidence rates were greater for breast reconstruction patients, because of the post-mastectomy changes to the soft-tissues and to the skin envelope of the breast, and to the anatomical borders of the breast, especially in women who received adjuvant external radiation therapy. Moreover, besides breast reconstruction, breast cancer patients usually undergo revision surgery of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and symmetry procedures upon the opposite breast, to create a bust of natural appearance, size, form, and feel. Carefully matching the type and size of the breast implants to the patient&#x27;s pectoral soft-tissue characteristics reduces the incidence of revision surgery. Appropriate tissue matching, implant selection, and proper implantation technique, the re-operation rate was 3.0% at the 7-year-mark, compared with the re-operation rate of 20% at the 3-year-mark, as reported by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

====Systemic disease and sickness====
Since the 1990s, reviews of the studies that sought causal links between silicone-gel breast implants and systemic disease reported no link between the implants and subsequent systemic and autoimmune diseases. Nonetheless, during the 1990s, thousands of women claimed sicknesses they believed were caused by their breast implants, including neurological and rheumatological health problems.

In the study &quot;Long-term Health Status of Danish Women with Silicone Breast Implants&quot; (2004), the national healthcare system of Denmark reported that women with implants did not risk a greater incidence and diagnosis of autoimmune disease, when compared to same-age women in the general population; that the incidence of musculoskeletal disease was lower among women with breast implants than among women who had undergone other types of cosmetic surgery; and that they had a lower incidence rate than like women in the general population.

Follow-up longitudinal studies of these breast implant patients confirmed the previous findings on the matter. European and North American studies reported that women who underwent augmentation mammoplasty, and any plastic surgery procedure, tended to be healthier and wealthier than the general population, before and after implantation; that plastic surgery patients had a lower standardized mortality ratio than did patients for other surgeries; yet faced an increased risk of death by lung cancer than other plastic surgery patients. Moreover, because only one study, the Swedish &quot;Long-term Cancer Risk Among Swedish Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants: an Update of a Nationwide Study&quot; (2006), controlled for tobacco smoking information, the data were insufficient to establish verifiable statistical differences between smokers and non-smokers that might contribute to the higher lung cancer mortality rate of women with breast implants. The long-term study of 25,000 women, &quot;Mortality among Canadian Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants&quot; (2006), reported that the &quot;findings suggest that breast implants do not directly increase mortality in women.&quot;

The study &quot;Silicone gel Breast Implant Rupture, Extracapsular Silicone, and Health Status in a Population of Women&quot; (2001), reported increased incidences of fibromyalgia among women who had extracapsular silicone-gel leakage than among women whose breast implants neither ruptured nor leaked. The study later was criticized as significantly methodologically flawed, and a number of large subsequent follow-up studies have not shown any evidence of a causal device–disease association. After investigating, the U.S. FDA has concluded &quot;the weight of the epidemiological evidence published in the literature does not support an association between fibromyalgia and breast implants.&quot; The systemic review study, &quot;Silicone Breast implants and Connective tissue Disease: No Association&quot; (2011) reported the investigational conclusion that &quot;any claims that remain regarding an association between cosmetic breast implants and CTDs are not supported by the scientific literature&quot;.

===Platinum toxicity===

The manufacture of silicone breast implants requires the metallic element platinum (Pt, 78) as a catalyst to accelerate the transformation of silicone oil into silicone gel for making the elastomer silicone shells, and for making other medical-silicone devices. The literature indicates that trace quantities of platinum leak from such types of silicone breast implant; therefore, platinum is present in the surrounding pectoral tissue(s). The rare pathogenic consequence is an accumulation of platinum in the bone marrow, from where blood cells might deliver it to nerve endings, thus causing nervous system disorders such as blindness, deafness, and nervous tics (involuntary muscle contractions).

In 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) reviewed the studies on the human biological effects of breast-implant platinum, and reported little causal evidence of platinum toxicity to women with breast implants. Furthermore, in the journal &quot;Analytical Chemistry&quot;, the study &quot;Total Platinum Concentration and Platinum Oxidation States in Body Fluids, Tissue, and Explants from Women Exposed to Silicone and Saline Breast Implants by IC-ICPMS&quot; (2006) proved controversial for claiming to have identified previously undocumented toxic platinum oxidative states &quot;in vivo&quot;. Later, in a letter to the readers, the editors of &quot;Analytical Chemistry&quot; published their concerns about the faulty experimental design of the study, and warned readers to &quot;use caution in evaluating the conclusions drawn in the paper&quot;.

Furthermore, after reviewing the research data of the study &quot;Total Platinum Concentration and Platinum Oxidation States in Body Fluids, Tissue, and Explants from Women Exposed to Silicone and Saline Breast Implants by IC-ICPMS&quot;, and other pertinent literature, the U.S. FDA reported that the data do not support the findings presented; that the platinum used in new-model breast implant devices likely is not ionized, and therefore is not a significant risk to the health of the women.

==Non-implant breast augmentation==
Non-implant breast augmentation with injections of autologous fat grafts (adipocyte tissue) is indicated for women requiring breast reconstruction, defect correction, and the æsthetic enhancement of the bust.
* breast reconstruction: post-mastectomy re-creation of the breast(s); trauma-damaged tissues (blunt, penetrating), disease (breast cancer), and explantation deformity (empty breast-implant socket).
* congenital defect correction: micromastia, tuberous breast deformity, Poland&#x27;s syndrome, etc.
* primary augmentation: the aesthetic enhancement (contouring) of the size, form, and feel of the breasts.

The operating room time of breast reconstruction, congenital defect correction, and primary breast augmentation procedures is determined by the indications to be treated.

The advent of liposuction technology facilitated medical applications of the liposuction-harvested fat tissue as autologous filler for injection to correct bodily defects, and for breast augmentation. Melvin Bircoll introduced the practice of contouring the breast and for correcting bodily defects with autologous fat grafts harvested by liposuction; and he presented the fat-injection method used for emplacing the fat grafts. In 1987, the Venezuelan plastic surgeon Eduardo Krulig emplaced fat grafts with a syringe and blunt needle (lipo-injection), and later used a disposable fat trap to facilitate the collection and to ensure the sterility of the harvested adipocyte tissue.

To emplace the grafts of autologous fat-tissue, doctors J. Newman and J. Levin designed a lipo-injector gun with a gear-driven plunger, which allowed the even injection of autologous fat-tissue to the desired recipient sites. The control afforded by the lipo-injector gun assisted the plastic surgeon in controlling excessive pressure to the fat in the barrel of the syringe, thus avoiding over-filling the recipient site. The later-design lipo-injector gun featured a ratchet-gear operation that afforded the surgeon greater control in accurately emplacing grafts of autologous fat to the recipient site; a trigger action injected 0.1 cm3 of filler. Since 1989, most non-surgical, fat-graft augmentations of the breast employ adipocyte fat from sites other than the breast, up to 300 ml of fat in three equal injections, is placed into the subpectoral space and the intrapectoral space of the pectoralis major muscle, as well as the submammary space, to achieve a breast outcome of natural appearance and contour.

===Autologous fat grafting===

The technique of autologous fat-graft injection to the breast is applied for the correction of breast asymmetry or deformities, for post-mastectomy breast reconstruction (as a primary and as an adjunct technique), for the improvement of soft-tissue coverage of breast implants, and for the aesthetic enhancement of the bust. The careful harvesting and centrifugal refinement of the mature adipocyte tissue (injected in small aliquots) allows the transplanted fat tissue to remain viable in the breast, where it provides the anatomical structure and the hemispheric contour that cannot be achieved solely with breast implants or with corrective plastic surgery.

In fat-graft breast augmentation procedures, there is the risk that the adipocyte tissue grafted to the breast(s) can undergo necrosis, metastatic calcification, develop cysts, and agglomerate into palpable lumps. Although the cause of metastatic calcification is unknown, the post-procedure biological changes occurred to the fat-graft tissue resemble the tissue changes usual to breast surgery procedures such as reduction mammoplasty. The French study &quot;Radiological Evaluation of Breasts Reconstructed with Lipo-modeling&quot; (2005) indicates the therapeutic efficacy of fat-graft breast reconstruction in the treatment of radiation therapy damage to the chest, the incidental reduction of capsular contracture, and the improved soft-tissue coverage of breast implants.

The study &quot;Fat Grafting to the Breast Revisited: Safety and Efficacy&quot; (2007) reported successful transfers of body fat to the breast, and proposed the fat-graft injection technique as an alternative (i.e., non-implant) augmentation mammoplasty procedure instead of the surgical procedures usual for effecting breast augmentation, breast defect correction, and breast reconstruction.

Structural fat-grafting was performed either to one breast or to both breasts of the 17 women; the age range of the women was 25–55 years; the mean age was 38.2 years; the average volume of a tissue-graft was 278.6 cm3 of fat per operation, per breast.

The pre-procedure mammograms were negative for malignant neoplasms. In the 17-patient cohort, it was noted that two women developed breast cancer (diagnosed by mammogram) post-procedure: one at 12 months, and the other at 92 months. Further, the study &quot;Cell-assisted Lipotransfer for Cosmetic Breast Augmentation: Supportive Use of Adipose-Derived Stem/Stromal Cells&quot; (2007), an approximately 40-woman cohort indicated that the inclusion of adipose stem cells in the grafts of adipocyte fat increased the rate of corrective success of the autologous fat-grafting procedure.

===Fat grafting techniques===
====Fat harvesting and contouring====

The centrifugal refinement of the liposuction-harvested adipocyte tissues removes blood products and free lipids to produce autologous breast filler. The injectable filler-fat is obtained by centrifuging (spinning) the fat-filled syringes for sufficient time to allow the serum, blood, and oil (liquid fat) components to collect, by density, apart from the refined, injection-quality fat. To refine the fat for facial injection quality, the fat-filled syringes are centrifuged for 1.0 minute at 2,000 RPM, which separates the unnecessary solution, leaving refined filler-fat. Moreover, centrifugation at 10,000 RPM for 10 minutes produces a &quot;collagen graft&quot;; the histologic composition of which is cell residues, collagen fibres, and 5.0 percent intact fat cells. Furthermore, because the patient&#x27;s body naturally absorbs some of the fat grafts, the breasts maintain their contours and volumes for 18–24 months.

In the study &quot;Fat Grafting to the Breast Revisited: Safety and Efficacy&quot; (2007), the investigators reported that the autologous fat was harvested by liposuction, using a 10-ml syringe attached to a two-hole Coleman harvesting cannula; after centrifugation, the refined breast filler fat was transferred to 3-ml syringes. Blunt infiltration cannulas were used to emplace the fat through 2-mm incisions; the blunt cannula injection method allowed greater dispersion of small aliquots (equal measures) of fat, and reduced the possibility of intravascular fat injection; no sharp needles are used for fat-graft injection to the breasts. The 2-mm incisions were positioned to allow the infiltration (emplacement) of fat grafts from at least two directions; a 0.2 ml fat volume was emplaced with each withdrawal of the cannula.

The breasts were contoured by layering the fat grafts into different levels within the breast, until achieving the desired breast form. The fat-graft injection technique allows the plastic surgeon precise control in accurately contouring the breastfrom the chest wall to the breast skin envelopewith subcutaneous fat grafts to the superficial planes of the breast. This greater degree of breast sculpting is unlike the global augmentation realised with a breast implant emplaced below the breast or below the pectoralis major muscle, respectively expanding the retromammary space and the retropectoral space. The greatest proportion of the grafted fat usually is infiltrated to the pectoralis major muscle, then to the retropectoral space, and to the prepectoral space, (before and behind the pectoralis major muscle). Moreover, although fat grafting to the breast parenchyma usually is minimal, it is performed to increase the degree of projection of the bust.

====Fat-graft injection====
The biologic survival of autologous fat tissue depends upon the correct handling of the fat graft, of its careful washing (refinement) to remove extraneous blood cells, and of the controlled, blunt-cannula injection (emplacement) of the refined fat-tissue grafts to an adequately vascularized recipient site. Because the body resorbs some of the injected fat grafts (volume loss), compensative over-filling aids in obtaining a satisfactory breast outcome for the patient; thus the transplantation of large-volume fat grafts greater than required, because only 25–50 percent of the fat graft survives at 1-year post-transplantation.

The correct technique maximizes fat graft survival by minimizing cellular trauma during the liposuction harvesting and the centrifugal refinement, and by injecting the fat in small aliquots (equal measures), not clumps (too-large measures). Injecting minimal-volume aliquots with each pass of the cannula maximizes the surface area contact, between the grafted fat-tissue and the recipient breast-tissue, because proximity to a vascular system (blood supply) encourages histologic survival and minimizes the potential for fat necrosis. Transplanted autologous fat tissue undergoes histologic changes like those undergone by a bone transplant; if the body accepts the fat-tissue graft, it is replaced with new fat tissue, if the fat-graft dies it is replaced by fibrous tissue. New fat tissue is generated by the activity of a large, wandering histocyte-type cell, which ingests fat and then becomes a fat cell. When the breast-filler fat is injected to the breasts in clumps (too-large measures), fat cells emplaced too distant from blood vessels might die, which can lead to fat tissue necrosis, causing lumps, calcifications, and the eventual formation of liponecrotic cysts.

The operating room time required to harvest, refine, and emplace fat to the breasts is greater than the usual 2-hour OR time; the usual infiltration time was approximately 2 hours for the first 100 cm3 volume, and approximately 45 minutes for injecting each additional 100 cm3 volume of breast-filler fat. The technique for injecting fat grafts for breast augmentation allows the plastic surgeon great control in sculpting the breasts to the required contour, especially in the correction of tuberous breast deformity. In which case, no fat-graft is emplaced beneath the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and the skin envelope of the breast is selectively expanded (contoured) with subcutaneously emplaced body-fat, immediately beneath the skin. Such controlled contouring selectively increased the proportional volume of the breast in relation to the size of the nipple-areola complex, and thus created a breast of natural form and appearance; greater verisimilitude than is achieved solely with breast implants. The fat-corrected, breast-implant deformities, were inadequate soft-tissue coverage of the implant(s) and capsular contracture, achieved with subcutaneous fat-grafts that hid the implant-device edges and wrinkles, and decreased the palpability of the underlying breast implant. Furthermore, grafting autologous fat around the breast implant can result in softening the breast capsule.

====External tissue expansion====
The successful outcome of fat-graft breast augmentation is enhanced by achieving a pre-expanded recipient site to create the breast-tissue matrix that will receive grafts of autologous adipocyte fat. The recipient site is expanded with an external vacuum tissue-expander applied upon each breast. The biological effect of negative pressure (vacuum) expansion upon soft tissues derives from the ability of soft tissues to grow when subjected to controlled, distractive, mechanical forces. (see distraction osteogenesis) The study reported the technical effectiveness of recipient-site pre-expansion. In a single-group study, 17 healthy women (aged 18–40 years) wore a brassiere-like vacuum system that applied a 20-mmHg vacuum (controlled, mechanical, distraction force) to each breast for 10–12 hours daily for 10 weeks. Pre- and post-procedure, the breast volume (size) was periodically measured; likewise, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the breast-tissue architecture and water density was taken during the same phase of the patient&#x27;s menstrual cycle; of the 17-woman study group, 12 completed the study, and 5 withdrew, because of non-compliance with the clinical trial protocol.

The breast volume (size) of all 17 women increased throughout the 10-week treatment period, the greatest increment was at week 10 (final treatment)the average volume increase was 98+/–67 percent over the initial breast-size measures. Incidences of partial recoil occurred at 1-week post-procedure, with no further, significant, breast volume decrease afterwards, nor at the follow-up treatment at 30-weeks post-procedure. The stable, long-term increase in breast size was 55 percent (range 15–115%). The MRI visualizations of the breasts showed no edema, and confirmed the proportionate enlargement of the adipose and glandular components of the breast-tissue matrices. Furthermore, a statistically significant decrease in body weight occurred during the study, and self-esteem questionnaire scores improved from the initial-measure scores.

Because external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues permits injecting large-volume fat grafts (+300 cc) to correct defects and enhance the bust, the histologic viability of the breast filler (adipocyte fat) and its volume must be monitored and maintained. The long-term, volume maintenance data reported in &quot;Breast Augmentation using Pre-expansion and Autologous Fat Transplantation: a Clinical Radiological Study&quot; (2010) indicate the technical effectiveness of external tissue expansion of the recipient site for a 25-patient study group, who had 46 breasts augmented with fat grafts. The indications included micromastia (underdevelopment), explantation deformity (empty implant pocket), and congenital defects (tuberous breast deformity, Poland&#x27;s syndrome).

Pre-procedure, every patient used external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues to create a breast tissue matrix to be injected with autologous fat grafts of adipocyte tissue, refined via low G-force centrifugation. Pre- and post-procedure, the breast volumes were measured; the patients underwent pre-procedure and 6-month post-procedure MRI and 3D volumetric imaging examinations. At six months post-procedure, each woman had a significant increase in breast volume, ranging 60–200 percent, per the MRI (n=12) examinations. The size, form, and feel of the breasts was natural; post-procedure MRI examinations revealed no oil cysts or abnormality (neoplasm) in the fat-augmented breasts. Moreover, given the sensitive, biologic nature of breast tissue, periodic MRI and 3-D volumetric imaging examinations are required to monitor the breast-tissue viability and the maintenance of the large volume (+300 cc) fat grafts.

===Post-mastectomy procedures===
Surgical post-mastectomy breast reconstruction requires general anaesthesia, cuts the chest muscles, produces new scars, and requires a long post-surgical recovery for the patient. The surgical emplacement of breast implant devices (saline or silicone) introduces a foreign object to the patient&#x27;s body (see capsular contracture). The TRAM flap (Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap) procedure reconstructs the breast using an autologous flap of abdominal, cutaneous, and muscle tissues. The latissimus myocutaneous flap employs skin fat and muscle harvested from the back, and a breast implant. The DIEP flap (Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforators) procedure uses an autologous flap of abdominal skin and fat tissue.

====Post-mastectomy fat-graft reconstruction====
The reconstruction of the breast(s) with grafts of autologous fat is a non-implant alternative to further surgery after a breast cancer surgery, be it a lumpectomy or a breast removalsimple (total) mastectomy, radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, skin-sparing mastectomy, and subcutaneous (nipple sparing) mastectomy. The breast is reconstructed by first applying external tissue expansion to the recipient-site tissues (adipose, glandular) to create a breast-tissue matrix that can be injected with autologous fat grafts (adipocyte tissue); the reconstructed breast has a natural form, look, and feel, and is generally sensate throughout and in the nipple-areola complex (NAC). The reconstruction of breasts with fat grafts requires a three-month treatment periodbegun after 3–5 weeks of external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues. The autologous breast-filler fat is harvested by liposuction from the patient&#x27;s body (buttocks, thighs, abdomen), is refined and then is injected (grafted) to the breast-tissue matrices (recipient sites), where the fat will thrive.

One method of non-implant breast reconstruction is initiated at the concluding steps of the breast cancer surgery, wherein the oncological surgeon is joined by the reconstructive plastic surgeon, who immediately begins harvesting, refining, and seeding (injecting) fat grafts to the post-mastectomy recipient site. After that initial post-mastectomy fat-graft seeding in the operating room, the patient leaves hospital with a slight breast mound that has been seeded to become the foundation tissue matrix for the breast reconstruction. Then, after 3–5 weeks of continual external vacuum expansion of the breast mound (seeded recipient-site)to promote the histologic regeneration of the extant tissues (fat, glandular) via increased blood circulation to the mastectomy scar (suture site)the patient formally undergoes the first fat-grafting session for the reconstruction of her breasts. The external vacuum expansion of the breast mound created an adequate, vascularised, breast-tissue matrix to which the autologous fat is injected; and, per the patient, such reconstruction affords almost-normal sensation throughout the breast and the nipple-areola complex. Patient recovery from non-surgical fat graft breast reconstruction permits her to resume normal life activities at 3-days post-procedure.
====Tissue engineering====
=====The breast mound=====

The breast-tissue matrix consists of engineered tissues of complex, implanted, biocompatible scaffolds seeded with the appropriate cells. The &quot;in-situ&quot; creation of a tissue matrix in the breast mound is begun with the external vacuum expansion of the mastectomy defect tissues (recipient site), for subsequent seeding (injecting) with autologous fat grafts of adipocyte tissue. A 2010 study, reported that serial fat-grafting to a pre-expanded recipient site achieved (with a few 2-mm incisions and minimally invasive blunt-cannula injection procedures), a non-implant outcome equivalent to a surgical breast reconstruction by autologous-flap procedure. Technically, the external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues created a skin envelope as it stretched the mastectomy scar, and so generated a fertile breast-tissue matrix to which were injected large-volume fat grafts (150–600 ml) to create a breast of natural form, look, and feel.

The fat graft breast reconstructions for 33 women (47 breasts, 14 irradiated), whose clinical statuses ranged from zero days to 30 years post-mastectomy, began with the pre-expansion of the breast mound (recipient site) with an external vacuum tissue-expander for 10 hours daily, for 10–30 days before the first grafting of autologous fat. The breast mound expansion was adequate when the mastectomy scar tissues stretched to create a 200–300 ml recipient matrix (skin envelope), that received a fat-suspension volume of 150–600 ml in each grafting session.

At one week post-procedure, the patients resumed using the external vacuum tissue-expander for 10 hours daily, until the next fat grafting session; 2–5 outpatient procedures, 6–16 weeks apart, were required until the plastic surgeon and the patient were satisfied with the volume, form, and feel of the reconstructed breasts. The follow-up mammogram and MRI examinations found neither defects (necrosis) nor abnormalities (neoplasms). At six months post-procedure, the reconstructed breasts had a natural form, look, and feel, and the stable breast-volumes ranged 300–600 ml per breast. The post-procedure mammographies indicated normal, fatty breasts with well-vascularized fat, and few, scattered, benign oil cysts. The occurred complications included pneumothorax and transient cysts.

=====Explantation deformity=====
The autologous fat graft replacement of breast implants (saline and silicone) resolves medical complications such as: capsular contracture, implant shell rupture, filler leakage (silent rupture), device deflation, and silicone-induced granulomas, which are medical conditions usually requiring re-operation and explantation (breast implant removal). The patient then has the option of surgical or non-implant breast corrections, either replacement of the explanted breast implants or fat-graft breast augmentation. Moreover, because fat-grafts are biologically sensitive, they cannot survive in the empty implantation pocket, instead, they are injected to and diffused within the breast-tissue matrix (recipient site), replacing approximately 50% of the volume of the removed implantas permanent breast augmentation. The outcome of the explantation correction is a bust of natural appearance; breasts of volume, form, and feel, thatalthough approximately 50% smaller than the explanted breast sizeare larger than the original breast size, pre-procedure.

=====Breast augmentation=====

The outcome of a breast augmentation with fat-graft injections depends upon proper patient selection, preparation, and correct technique for recipient site expansion, and the harvesting, refining, and injecting of the autologous breast filler fat. Technical success follows the adequate external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues (matrix) before the injection of large-volume grafts (220–650 cc) of autologous fat to the breasts. After harvesting by liposuction, the breast-filler fat was obtained by low G-force syringe centrifugation of the harvested fat to separate it, by density, from the crystalloid component. The refined breast filler then was injected to the pre-expanded recipient site; post-procedure, the patient resumed continual vacuum expansion therapy upon the injected breast, until the next fat grafting session. The mean operating room (OR) time was 2-hours, and there occurred no incidences of infection, cysts, seroma, hematoma, or tissue necrosis.

The breast-volume data reported in &quot;Breast Augmentation with Autologous Fat Grafting: A Clinical Radiological Study&quot; (2010) indicated a mean increase of 1.2 times the initial breast volume, at six months post-procedure. In a two-year period, 25 patients underwent breast augmentation by fat graft injection; at three weeks pre-procedure, before the fat grafting to the breast-tissue matrix (recipient site), the patients were photographed, and examined via intravenous contrast MRI or 3-D volumetric imaging, or both. The breast-filler fat was harvested by liposuction (abdomen, buttocks, thighs), and yielded fat-graft volumes of 220–650 cm3 per breast. At six months post-procedure, the follow-up treatment included photographs, intravenous contrast MRI or 3-D volumetric imaging, or both. Each woman had an increased breast volume of 250 cm3 per breast, a mean volume increase confirmed by quantitative MRI analysis. The mean increase in breast volume was 1.2 times the initial breast volume measurements; the statistical difference between the pre-procedure and the six-month post-procedure breast volumes was (P&lt; 00.0000007); the percentage increase basis of the breast volume was 60–80% of the initial, pre-procedure breast volume.

==Non-surgical procedures==
In 2003, the Thai government endorsed a regimen of self-massage exercises as an alternative to surgical breast augmentation with breast implants. The Thai government enrolled more than 20 women in publicly funded courses for the teaching of the technique; nonetheless, beyond Thailand, the technique is not endorsed by the mainstream medical community. Despite the promising results of a six-month study of the therapeutic effectiveness of the technique, the research physician recommended to the participant women that they also contribute to augmenting their busts by gaining weight.

==Complications and limitations==
===Medical complications===
In every surgical and nonsurgical procedure, the risk of medical complications exists before, during, and after a procedure, and, given the sensitive biological nature of breast tissues (adipocyte, glandular), this is especially true in the case of fat graft breast augmentation. Despite its relative technical simplicity, the injection (grafting) technique for breast augmentation is accompanied by post-procedure complicationsfat necrosis, calcification, and sclerotic noduleswhich directly influence the technical efficacy of the procedure, and of achieving a successful outcome. The Chinese study &quot;Breast Augmentation by Autologous Fat-injection Grafting: Management and Clinical analysis of Complications&quot; (2009), reported that the incidence of medical complications is reduced with strict control of the injection-rate (cm3/min) of the breast-filler volume being administered, and by diffusing the fat-grafts in layers to allow their even distribution within the breast tissue matrix. The complications occurred to the 17-patient group were identified and located with 3-D volumetric and MRI visualizations of the breast tissues and of any sclerotic lesions and abnormal tissue masses (malignant neoplasm). According to the characteristics of the defect or abnormality, the sclerotic lesion was excised and liquefied fat was aspirated; the excised samples indicated biological changes in the intramammary fat graftsfat necrosis, calcification, hyalinization, and fibroplasia.

The complications associated with injecting fat grafts to augment the breasts are like, but less severe, than the medical complications associated with other types of breast procedure. Technically, the use of minuscule (2-mm) incisions and blunt-cannula injection much reduce the incidence of damaging the underlying breast structures (milk ducts, blood vessels, nerves). Injected fat-tissue grafts that are not perfused among the tissues can die, and result in necrotic cysts and eventual calcificationsmedical complications common to breast procedures.

===Technical limitations===
When the patient&#x27;s body has insufficient adipocyte tissue to harvest as injectable breast filler, a combination of fat grafting and breast implants might provide the desired outcome. Although non-surgical breast augmentation with fat graft injections is not associated with implant-related medical complications (filler leakage, deflation, visibility, palpability, capsular contracture), the achievable breast volumes are physically limited; the large-volume, global bust augmentations realised with breast implants are not possible with the method of structural fat grafting. Global breast augmentation contrasts with the controlled breast augmentation of fat-graft injection, in the degree of control that the plastic surgeon has in achieving the desired breast contour and volume. The controlled augmentation is realised by infiltrating and diffusing the fat grafts throughout the breast; and it is feather-layered into the adjacent pectoral areas until achieving the desired outcome of breast volume and contour. Nonetheless, the physical fullness-of-breast achieved with injected fat-grafts does not visually translate into the type of buxom fullness achieved with breast implants; hence, patients who had plentiful fat-tissue to harvest attained a maximum breast augmentation of one bra cup size in one session of fat grafting to the breast.

===Breast cancer===
====Detection====

A contemporary woman&#x27;s lifetime probability of developing breast cancer is approximately one in seven. However, there is no causal evidence that fat grafting to the breast might be more conducive to breast cancer than are other breast procedures; because incidences of fat tissue necrosis and calcification occur in every such procedure: breast biopsy, implantation, radiation therapy, breast reduction, breast reconstruction, and liposuction of the breast. Nonetheless, detecting breast cancer is primary, and calcification incidence is secondary; thus, the patient is counselled to learn self-palpation of the breast and to undergo periodic mammographic examinations. Although the mammogram is the superior diagnostic technique for distinguishing among cancerous and benign lesions to the breast, any questionable lesion can be visualized ultrasonically and magnetically (MRI); biopsy follows any clinically suspicious lesion or indeterminate abnormality appeared in a radiograph.

====Therapy====

Breast augmentation via autologous fat grafts allows the oncological breast surgeon to consider conservative breast surgery procedures that usually are precluded by the presence of alloplastic breast implants, e.g. lumpectomy, if cancer is detected in an implant-augmented breast. In previously augmented patients, aesthetic outcomes cannot be ensured without removing the implant and performing mastectomy. Moreover, radiotherapy treatment is critical to reducing cancerous recurrence and to the maximal conservation of breast tissue; yet, radiotherapy of an implant-augmented breast much increases the incidence of medical complicationscapsular contracture, infection, extrusion, and poor cosmetic outcome.

====Post-cancer breast reconstruction====

After mastectomy, surgical breast reconstruction with autogenous skin flaps and with breast implants can produce subtle deformities and deficiencies resultant from such global breast augmentation, thus the breast reconstruction is incomplete. In which case, fat graft injection can provide the missing coverage and fullness, and might relax the breast capsule. The fat can be injected as either large grafts or as small grafts, as required to correct difficult axillary deficiencies, improper breast contour, visible implant edges, capsular contracture, and tissue damage consequent to radiation therapy.

<text>54-40 (often stylized 54•40) is a Canadian rock band from Tsawwassen, Delta, British Columbia. The band take their name from the slogan &quot;54-40 or Fight!&quot;, coined to express the successful expansionist agenda of James K. Polk&#x27;s presidency, which was intent upon controlling a contested U.S.-Canada border area in the Oregon boundary dispute. 54-40 has had a successful career, with four of their albums being certified platinum in Canada. The band has been nominated for eight Juno Awards. Between 1996 and 2016, 54-40 were among the top 150 best-selling Canadian artists in Canada and among the top 50 best-selling Canadian bands in Canada.

==History==
Neil Osborne and Brad Merritt met in 1978 at South Delta High School in Tsawwassen, British Columbia. After studying at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Osborne returned home and formed the band 54-40 with Merritt and drummer Ian Franey. The band played their first gig in Coquitlam on December 8, 1980, the night John Lennon was killed. In 1981 they made their first recordings for the Mo-Da-Mu label, with four tracks appearing on the independent compilation LP &quot;Things Are Still Coming Ashore&quot;, which also featured music by Vancouver bands Animal Slaves and Junco Run. In June 1982, the band released the EP &quot;Selection&quot;. Shortly after the release of &quot;Selection&quot;, Franey left the band. Franey was replaced by Darryl Neudorf and Phil Comparelli was added on guitar, trumpet and vocals. The band recorded the album &quot;Set the Fire&quot; in 1983, releasing it in 1984. Neudorf, frustrated with the band&#x27;s prolonged time in the studio and away from the road, left the band in 1985. He was replaced by Matt Johnson. 

The band&#x27;s self-titled second album, released in 1986 through Warner/Reprise Records, began to attract attention from radio and record buyers across Canada, with the singles &quot;Baby Ran&quot; and &quot;I Go Blind&quot; gaining significant college radio airplay. Dave Osborne (keyboards, harmonica), toured and recorded with the band from 1987 to 1993. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Show Me&quot;, became their commercial breakthrough in Canada, with the hits &quot;One Day in Your Life&quot; and &quot;One Gun&quot;.

Although the band was popular on college radio in the United States, they never had a commercial breakthrough, and Warner dropped 54-40 in 1990. In 1991, the band released the compilation album, &quot;Sweeter Things&quot;. Also during that year, the band signed a deal with Sony and released &quot;Dear Dear&quot; in 1992. It was the band&#x27;s first album to be certified Gold in Canada and was certified Platinum in 1993. The band released &quot;Smilin&#x27; Buddha Cabaret&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Trusted by Millions&quot; in 1996, both of which would later be certified Platinum.

The band&#x27;s song &quot;I Go Blind&quot; was covered in the mid-1990s by American band Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, and the cover was featured on the first soundtrack to the TV series &quot;Friends&quot;. The song also appears on two compilations released by the band: 2000&#x27;s &quot;Scattered, Smothered and Covered&quot; and 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Best of Hootie &amp; the Blowfish (1993 Thru 2003)&quot;. Royalties from the Hootie and the Blowfish cover enabled the band to build their own recording studio in Vancouver.

Dave Genn, formerly of Matthew Good Band, joined 54-40 in 2003. In February 2005, it was announced that Comparelli left the band for personal reasons. That same year, 54-40 signed with True North Records.

In 2010, to celebrate the band&#x27;s 30 years together and almost 25 years since their first commercial album &quot;The Green Album&quot;, the band went on a promotional concert tour with a two-set act. The first set was &quot;The Green Album&quot; from start to finish. The second set was one song from every album since, with the exception of &quot;Dear Dear&quot; where they played two songs. 54-40 also performed a new song from their upcoming record, &quot;Lost in the City&quot;, which was released on June 14, 2011.

In January 2016, the band released a greatest hits album titled &quot;La Difference: A History Unplugged&quot;. Tracks included &quot;One Day In Your Life&quot;, &quot;I Go Blind&quot;, and &quot;Ocean Pearl&quot;. The album was released through eOne Music. The band then set out on a month-long theatre tour across Canada to support the album. In 2017 they played at Peachfest in Penticton.

In 2018 54-40 performed with fiddler Daniel Lapp, both locally and also as the opening band at Ottawa&#x27;s CityFolk Festival.

Lead singer Neil Osborne began playing shows with his daughter, singer-songwriter Kandle, billing themselves as A Family Curse, self-described as &quot;pure folk-art worked from found objects (something old, something new).&quot; A Toronto show took place May 8, 2019 at the intimate and tiny 20-capacity Radical Road Brewing Co. The father-daughter duo played later that year on August 7, 2019 as part of Roy Thompson Hall&#x27;s Live on the Patio series, also in Toronto. These shows were bookended by shows in Montréal, where Kandle resides, in February and August 2019.

54-40 played the legendary Horseshoe Tavern&#x27;s 72nd anniversary party on December 6, 2019. Sam Cash, son of Toronto post-punk musician turned city politician Andrew Cash, opened the show.

<text>Labrador (formerly known as Grand Falls—White Bay—Labrador and Grand Falls—White Bay) is a federal electoral district in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1949.

The riding covers all of Labrador and with just 26,000 people located in the riding it is the least populous in Canada. From 2005 to 2011, the riding was represented by Liberal MP Todd Russell. He was defeated by Conservative Peter Penashue in the 2011 federal election. Following allegations of irregularities in his campaign spending, Penashue announced on March 14, 2013 that he would resign his seat and run again as a candidate in a new by-election. Penashue subsequently lost the by-election to Liberal candidate Yvonne Jones. Jones was re-elected in the 2015, 2019, and 2021 federal elections. The riding is viewed as a Liberal stronghold.

The riding contains a large indigenous population, including the Inuit self-governing territory of Nunatsiavut, as well as two Innu reserves Sheshatshiu and Natuashish. The Voisey&#x27;s Bay nickel mine, near Nain, is also in the riding.

All six indigenous communities on the North Coast are inaccessible by road and may be reached only by air or sea.

==Demographics==
This riding is the least populous in Canada. Citing the region&#x27;s highly distinct identity and seeing it as a community of interest they have the legal duty to respect, successive electoral boundary commissions have used their ability to make exceptions to the general electoral quotient to maintain Labrador as a separate riding.

In earlier representation orders, it was joined with communities on the Great Northern Peninsula of the island of Newfoundland.

Ethnic groups: 65.1% White, 34.9% Native Canadian 
Languages (2016): 86.4% English, 5.6% Innu, 2.3% Naskapi, 1.5% French, 1.4% Inuktitut, 1.3% Tagalog, 0.1% German, 0.1% Panjabi, 0.1% Spanish
Religions: 67.4% Protestant, 28.4% Catholic, 3.4% No affiliation 
Average income: $27 138

==Geography==
The district includes all of Labrador, including Belle Isle, North and South Aulatsivik Island.

The neighbouring ridings are Nunavut, Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou, Manicouagan, and Long Range Mountains.

According to Elections Canada, the boundaries of this riding for the 39th General Election (2006) are:

:&quot;Consisting of all that part of the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador known as Labrador, including Belle Isle.&quot;

The 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution concluded that the electoral boundaries of Labrador should be preserved with no boundary changes for future elections.

See the map of the Labrador riding.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 1949 upon the admission of Newfoundland to Canada. Between 1949 and 1988, this district was attached to the Island of Newfoundland, where more than half of its electorate resided. Liberal MP Bill Rompkey held the seat from 1972 till his appointment to the Senate of Canada in 1995. Lawrence D. O&#x27;Brien was later elected in a by-election and held the district until his death in 2004.

A by-election was held on May 24, 2005, with the result tipping the balance of the evenly split 38th Parliament. The Liberal candidate, Todd Russell, who was heavily favoured, ended up winning, but with a reduced percentage from the 2004 election.

On December 16, 2004, MP Lawrence O&#x27;Brien died of cancer, the next year Prime Minister Paul Martin called a by-election for May 24, 2005. There was a possibility the by-election would not be held because of a non-confidence vote the week prior. The non-confidence vote would have toppled the government sending Canadians to the polls, which would have superseded the by-election. However, the motion failed by one vote, ensuring the by-election.

The seat has traditionally been a Liberal stronghold, and O&#x27;Brien always carried the riding with comfortable pluralities. However, the federal Liberals had lost popularity in Atlantic Canada since the 2004 federal election largely because of disputes with the Progressive Conservative provincial governments of these provinces, especially that of Newfoundland and Labrador over the relationship between offshore oil revenues and equalization payments.

Historically, governing parties fare poorly in federal by-elections. However, this by-election was especially significant because of the make-up of the 38th Canadian Parliament. Following the 2004 election, the Liberals and the New Democratic Party held 154 seats together, or exactly half of the 308-seat House of Commons. After Liberal MP Carolyn Parrish was expelled from that party, the two parties&#x27; combined total (prior to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s death) had been reduced to 153 (or 152 who are eligible to vote since the Speaker was elected as a Liberal). The Liberals were anxious to retain the seat, as its loss would have left the opposition Conservative Party of Canada or the Bloc Québécois as the only viable partners for the Liberals to get legislation passed in the House. Former Liberal MP David Kilgour had left the party, further reducing its strength.

Since the general election, it had been suggested that the New Democratic Party refrain from contesting by-elections in seats where the Liberals were strong but the NDP are not, to avoid splitting the vote and thus help improve the chances securing a better position for the NDP in the House. Labrador would certainly be a prime example of such a seat — the NDP finished a distant fourth in the 2004 election. However, historically the NDP has been adamant in contesting all by-elections, and NDP leader Jack Layton showed little interest in any such proposal. The NDP nominated Frances Fry on April 23 feeling it had a chance in this seat because of the Liberal fall in polls and the fact that the provincial NDP had one of its two seats in Labrador.

In the end, the Liberals picked up an easy victory, as expected, but while their actual vote total did not go down by much, their percentage of the vote went down over 10 points from the previous election as turnout was over 9% more than in the 2004 election. This high turnout is virtually unheard of for by-elections which normally have extremely poor turnouts. The additional voters appear to have been brought out by the tense national political situation and mostly voted for the Conservatives who picked up nearly 17 percentage points and the New Democrats who also increased their vote total.

<doc id="630857" wikidata="Q150234" url="?curid=630857" title="2865 Laurel">
<text>2865 Laurel, provisional designation , is a stony Marian asteroid from the middle region of the asteroid belt, approximately 15 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by English-born South African astronomer Cyril Jackson at Johannesburg Observatory on 31 July 1935. The asteroid was named after movie comedian Stan Laurel.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Laurel&quot; orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.4–2.7 AU once every 4 years and 1 month (1,497 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 14° with respect to the ecliptic. No precoveries were taken and the asteroid&#x27;s observation arc begins with its discovery observation in 1935.

== Physical characteristics ==

&quot;Laurel&quot; has been characterized as a common S-type asteroid by PanSTARRS″ photometric survey.

=== Rotation period ===

A rotational lightcurve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomer Pierre Antonini in September 2005. It gave a longer than average rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.15 in magnitude ().

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures between 14.7 and 25.0 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.09 and 0.22. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; agrees with IRAS and derives an albedo of 0.24 and a diameter 14.8 kilometers.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after English-born slapstick film comedian Stan Laurel (1890–1965). Together with Oliver Hardy (1892–1957), who was honored with the main-belt asteroid 2866 Hardy, they formed the first great comedy duo in Classical Hollywood cinema. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 September 1993 (), based on a suggestion by Gareth V. Williams and others.

<text> is the Latin phrase meaning &quot;Dare to know&quot;; and also is loosely translated as &quot;Have courage to use your own reason&quot;, &quot;Dare to know things through reason&quot;. Originally used in the &quot;First Book of Letters&quot; (20 BC), by the Roman poet Horace, the phrase became associated with the Age of Enlightenment, during the 17th and 18th centuries, after Immanuel Kant used it in the essay &quot;Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?&quot; (1784). As a philosopher, Kant claimed the phrase as the motto for the entire period of the Enlightenment, and used it to develop his theories of the application of reason in the public sphere of human affairs.

In 1984, Michel Foucault&#x27;s essay &quot;What is Enlightenment?&quot; took up Kant&#x27;s formulation of &quot;dare to know&quot; in an attempt to find a place for the individual man and woman in post-structuralist philosophy, and so come to terms with what he alleges is the problematic legacy of the Enlightenment. Moreover, in the essay &quot;The Baroque Episteme: The Word and the Thing&quot; (2013) Jean-Claude Vuillemin proposed that the Latin phrase be the motto of the Baroque &quot;episteme&quot;.

The phrase is widely used as a motto, especially by educational institutions.

The original use of the phrase appears in the &quot;First Book of Letters&quot; (20 BC), by the Roman poet Horace; in the second letter, addressed to Lolius, in line 40, the passage is: &quot;Dimidium facti, qui coepit, habet; sapere aude, incipe.&quot; (&quot;He who has begun is half done; dare to know; begin!&quot;)

The phrase is the moral to a story in which a fool waits for a stream to cease flowing, before attempting to cross it. In saying, &quot;He who begins is half done. Dare to know, begin!&quot;, Horace suggests the value of human endeavour, of persistence in reaching a goal, of the need for effort to overcome obstacles. Moreover, the laconic Latin of also can be loosely translated as the English phrase &quot;Dare to be wise&quot;.

===4th century===
;Augustine
Augustine of Hippo quotes Horace&#x27;s maxim in his early philosophical dialogue &quot;De quantitate animae&quot;, 23.41, telling his interlocutor Evodius not to be afraid of questioning his teaching on the capabilities of the soul:

&quot;Noli nimis ex auctoritate pendere, praesertim mea quae nulla est; et quod ait Horatius: &#x27;Sapere aude&#x27;, ne non te ratio subiuget priusquam metus.&quot;

&quot;Don&#x27;t rely so much on authority, especially on mine, which is null. There is also that saying from Horace: &#x27;Dare to be wise!&#x27;, so that fear may not subdue you more than reason does.&quot;

===16th century===
;Philip Melanchthon

In his inaugural address as Professor of Greek in Wittenberg on August 29, 1518, Philip Melanchthon quoted Horace&#x27;s letter.

===18th century===
;Immanuel Kant
In the essay, &quot;Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?&quot; (1784), Immanuel Kant describes the Age of Enlightenment as &quot;Man&#x27;s release from his self-incurred immaturity&quot;; and, with the phrase , the philosopher charges the reader to follow such a program of intellectual self-liberation, by means of Reason. The essay is Kant&#x27;s shrewd, political challenge to men and women, suggesting that the mass of &quot;domestic cattle&quot; have been bred, by unfaithful stewards, to not question what they have been told about the world and its ways.

Kant classifies the uses of reason as public and private. The public use of reason is discourse in the public sphere, such as political discourse (argument and analysis); the private use of reason is rational argument, such as that used by a person entrusted with a duty, either official or organizational. Skillfully praising King Frederick II of Prussia (r. 1740–86) for his intellectual receptiveness to the political, social, and cultural ideas of the Enlightenment, the philosopher Kant proposes that an enlightened prince is one who instructs his subjects to: &quot;Argue as much as you will, and about what you will, only obey!&quot;

It is the courage of the individual man to abide the advice that will break the shackles of despotism, and reveal, through public discourse, for the benefit of the mass population and of the State, better methods of governance, and of legitimate complaint.

===19th century===
The founder of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann, used the phrase on the cover of his &quot;Organon of Medicine&quot; (various editions in 1810, 1819, 1824, 1829, 1833 and 1922).

In 1869 the newly-founded University of Otago in Dunedin chose the phrase as their motto.

===20th century===
;Michel Foucault
In response to Immanuel Kant&#x27;s Age of Enlightenment propositions for intellectual courage, in the essay &quot;What is Enlightenment?&quot; (1984), Michel Foucault rejected much of the hopeful politics proposed by Kant: a people ruled by just rulers; ethical leaders inspired by the existential dare advised in the phrase . Instead, Foucault applied ontology to examine the innate resources for critical thinking of a person&#x27;s faculty of Reason. With the analytical value of reinforced by the concept of &quot;Faithful betrayal&quot; to impracticable beliefs, Foucault disputed the Enlightenment-era arguments that Kant presents in the essay &quot;Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?&quot; (1784).

Like his 18th-century predecessor, Foucault also based his philosophic interpretation of upon a definite practice of critical thinking that is an &quot;attitude, an ethos, a philosophical life in which [is found] the critique of what we are&quot;. Such an enlightened, intellectual attitude applies reason to experience, and so effects a historical criticism of &quot;the limits that are imposed on us&quot;. The criticism is &quot;an experiment with the possibility of going beyond&quot; imposed limits, in order to reach the limit-experience, which simultaneously is an individual, personal act, and an act that breaks the concept of the individual person.

<text>An impressionist or a mimic is a performer whose act consists of imitating sounds, voices and mannerisms of celebrities and cartoon characters. The word usually refers to a professional comedian/entertainer who specializes in such performances and has developed a wide repertoire of impressions, including adding to them, often to keep pace with current events. Impressionist performances are a classic casino entertainment genre.

Someone who imitates one particular person without claiming a wide range, such as a lookalike, is instead called an impersonator. In very broad contexts, &quot;impersonator&quot; may be substituted for &quot;impressionist&quot; where the distinction between the two is less important than avoiding confusion with the use of &quot;impressionist&quot; in painting and music.

Usually the most &quot;impressive&quot; aspect of the performance is the vocal fidelity to the target – usually a politician or a famous person. Props may also be employed, such as glasses or hats, but these are now considered somewhat old-fashioned and cumbersome: the voice is expected to carry the act.

Because animated cartoons often lampoon famous people (sometimes obliquely), a facility for impressions is one of the marks of a successful voice actor. Many cartoon characters are intended to be recognized by the audience as evoking a specific celebrity, even when not explicitly named. With such indirect references, the entertainment value does not lie so much in the technical achievement of exactly reproducing the voice so much as in merely making it recognizable; the joke lies in the reference to a celebrity, not in its rendition.

==In Britain==
During the 1970s, British television was awash with impressions of Frank Spencer, a character from the hugely popular British sitcom &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot;. This may have been because Frank had such distinctive mannerisms and dress sense which gave performers a number of visual shortcuts to cover for failings in their abilities. For about a decade, no British impressionist&#x27;s act was complete without Frank.

From the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, Mike Yarwood dominated the impressionist scene, with his own TV shows regularly attracting more than 10 million viewers. Impressionists were very popular on the televised talent shows of the 1970s; Lenny Henry is a notable example of an act that developed from this.

In the 1990s, there was a certain absence of impressionists on television, with the demise of &quot;Spitting Image&quot; and Rory Bremner mainly concentrating on political figures (notably John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and also members of the Royal Family). Then, in 1999, came &quot;Alistair McGowan&#x27;s Big Impression,&quot; with Alistair McGowan and Ronni Ancona, and in 2002 &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;. Both of these shows featured impressions of celebrities and television personalities, as well as sporting figures on the former and politicians on the latter. In the same year as &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;&#x27; debut, Channel 4 began broadcasting the adult sketch show &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot;, created by and starring comedian Leigh Francis, which spoofed singers, including Craig David, Mel B and Michael Jackson; however, the show focused on making caricatures out of celebrities rather than impersonating them.

&quot;The Icons in London&quot;, which ran at The Venue in Leicester Square from 4 January to 28 February 2007 and starred the notable impressionist Greg London, is the first original musical to have dealt with impressions in depth. The book was by Greg London, West End theatre director David Taylor and London playwright Paul Miller. In 2009, a new BBC One impressions show, &quot;The Impressions Show with Culshaw and Stephenson&quot;, was a big hit, starring Jon Culshaw and Debra Stephenson donning Britain&#x27;s most famous faces. A third series of the programme premiered in October 2011.

==In North America==
From the late 1960s, Rich Little has been the pre-eminent impressionist, mimicking a wide range of celebrities and politicians. The cast of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; have performed impressions of politicians and celebrities since the program debuted in 1975. Jimmy Fallon, a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumnus and current host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, rose to fame with stand-up comedy routines featuring impressions of many celebrities in various scenarios. Fellow &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumni Darrell Hammond, Bill Hader, and Jay Pharoah have been cited as &#x27;master impressionists&#x27;, each having performed impressions of over 80 different celebrities on the show. American impressionist Frank Caliendo is also widely known for his impressions of celebrities and personalities such as John Madden and George W. Bush, which he performed while starring in television series &quot;MADtv&quot;, &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot; and his own show &quot;Frank TV&quot;.

Many of today&#x27;s Presidential impressionists have been influenced by Vaughn Meader, whose 1962 impersonations of John F. Kennedy on the album &quot;The First Family&quot; made him famous.

Impressionists are a major part of animation; many film and television cartoons (especially adaptations of franchises) used impressions of famous celebrities of the era. Voice actors who are or were known for their celebrity impressions include Daws Butler, Mel Blanc, Don Messick, Maurice LaMarche, Tress MacNeille, James Arnold Taylor and Rob Paulsen.

Some impressionists have more specialized acts in the art. For example, Canadian comedian André-Philippe Gagnon, Canadian singer Véronic Dicaire, and American Greg London impersonate singing voices. Canadian Tracey Bell impersonates celebrities. Legends In Concert produces musical impressionist shows known as tribute artist productions.

==In India==

Nerella Venumadhav imitates world politicians, film artists, singers, poets, scenes from Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, popular movies including musical notes. Other notable actors include Jayaram, Sivakarthikeyan, and Dileep.

==In Hong Kong, China and Taiwan==
The entertainment industries in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan are famous for impersonations by singers. Some well-established singers such as Adam Cheng are considered first-generation impersonators. Notable singers/impersonators/comedians include Johnson Lee, Wong Cho Lam, Show Lo, Eason Chan, and JJ Lin and many more.

== Bird impressionists ==
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, prior to the advent of high quality recording, animal and bird impressionists were popular on stage as entertainers. Some prominent performers included Charles Crawford Gorst (USA), Charles Kellogg, Joe Belmont, Edward Avis, Alec Shaw and Percy Edwards (UK).

<text>Aziza Mustafa Zadeh (; born December 19, 1969) is an Azerbaijani singer, pianist, and composer who plays a fusion of jazz and mugham (a traditional improvisational style of Azerbaijan) with classical and avant-garde influences.

==Biography==
Aziza was born in Baku to musical parents Vagif and Elza Mustafa Zadeh (née Bandzeladze).

Aziza&#x27;s parents first noticed their daughter&#x27;s sensitivity to music when she was eight months old. Aziza recalls the story as her mother tells it: 

Aziza enjoyed all forms of art, especially dancing, painting and singing. At the age of three, she made her stage debut with her father, improvising vocals. She began studying classical piano at an early age, showing special interest in the works of famous composers Johann Sebastian Bach and Frédéric Chopin. Soon thereafter, she showed a growing talent for improvisation.

On December 16, 1979, Aziza&#x27;s father died of a severe heart attack in Tashkent at the age of 39. In order to help her daughter cope with this blow, Aziza&#x27;s mother gave up her career as a singer to help nurture her daughter&#x27;s own musical talents.

In 1988, at the age of 18, Aziza&#x27;s mugam-influenced style helped her win third place together with American Matt Cooper in the Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz (formerly Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz) piano competition in Washington, D.C. It was around this time that she moved to Germany with her mother.

Aziza released her debut album, &quot;Aziza Mustafa Zadeh&quot;, in 1991. The album showed influence of Chick Corea and Keith Jarrett, as well as Near Eastern music. Her second album, &quot;Always&quot;, won her the Phono Academy Prize, a prestigious German music award, and the Echo Prize from Sony. She has since performed in many countries with many jazz and traditional luminaries and released several more albums, the most recent being &quot;Generations&quot;, released in 2020.

Aziza currently resides in Mainz, Germany, with her mother, Elza Mustafa Zadeh, who is also her manager. Her two favorite leisure activities, she says, are painting and sleeping. She believes in God, though she does not consider herself as belonging to any religion.

===Baku Jazz Festival 2007===
Aziza visited Azerbaijan in June 2007 for the Baku Jazz Festival, starring in her own concert at the Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater and headlining the end-of-festival concert at the open-air Green Theater.

<doc id="630881" wikidata="Q193043" url="?curid=630881" title="Ferhat Abbas">
<text>Ferhat Abbas (; ALA-LC: ; 24 August 1899 – 24 December 1985) was an Algerian politician who acted in a provisional capacity as the then yet-to-become independent country&#x27;s Prime Minister from 1958 to 1961, as well as the first President of the National Assembly and the first acting Chief of State after independence. 

An influential figure in the Young Algerians, Abbas initially advocated for equal political rights for Algerian Muslims in France and for the granting of French citizenship for Algerian Muslims. Over time, he became a revolutionary Algerian nationalist.

== Background ==
The son of a caid, Said Ben Ahmed Abbas and Achoura (Maza) Abbas, Ferhat Abbas was born in the village of Taher, Algeria. In addition to being a caid in the village of Chahna, his father had also been awarded the rosette and silver braid of a commander of the Legion of Honor.

The young Abbas was educated first at Phillipeville (now called Skikda), Constantine, where he received his baccalaureate. Before finishing his education, he was required to serve in the French army medical corps where he reached the rank of sergeant. Abbas then attended the pharmacy school at the University of Algiers. After graduating, Abbas worked as a pharmacist in Sétif, where he became involved in politics. There he was elected to the municipal council and then to the general council of Constantine.

During this period Abbas was pro-French in his outlook, as illustrated by such writings as an article dated 1936 titled &quot;I am France&quot;. However Abbas became disillusioned with France, during 1938, when his aspirations for equality showed no sign of being achieved. He accordingly organized the Algerian Popular Union (Union Populaire Algerienne). This organization promoted equal rights for both French and Algerians whilst maintaining Algerian culture and language as primary values.

With the outbreak of World War II, Abbas volunteered to rejoin the medical corps of the French Army. After his service, his political views continued to evolve and he turned away from France after General Giraud refused his requests to allow Muslims to enlist in their fight against the occupying forces as equals. His desire for change continued and he turned to nationalism, issuing the &quot;Manifesto of the Algerian People&quot; on February 10, 1943. The manifesto made apparent the philosophical changes that Abbas had undergone. He now condemned colonial rule by the French and demanded Algerian self-determination. Abbas argued the need for an Algerian constitution, which would grant equality to all Algerians. In May he, along with some colleagues, added a clause foreseeing a sovereign Algeria. The manifesto was published on June 26, but was rejected by the governor general. He, along with Messali Hadj form the Amis du Manifeste et de la Liberté, and called for an autonomous republic. This initiative resulted in Abbas being imprisoned for a year, and the quick dissolution of the AML. In 1946, Abbas formed the nationalist political party Union Démocratique du Manifeste Algérien (UDMA) when he was elected member of the Constituent Assembly of France. This new organization called for a more moderate approach, such as the formation of an Algerian state with the full cooperation of France. 1946 also saw him named as editor of the publication &quot;Egalité&quot;. He remained active in politics as a member of the Algerian Assembly through 1955. During these years he was arrested twice. His continuing efforts as a moderate nationalist did not succeed and he fled to Cairo, in 1956. While in Cairo, he worked alongside Ahmed Ben Bella, a fellow revolutionary.

== Involvement with FLN ==
As he was opposed to violence, Ferhat kept himself distant from the Algerian War, and continued to try to act as an intermediary to the opposing sides. However, after the French government intensified the war, in 1956, Ferhat joined the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN). His diplomatic skills were utilized by the FLN, as he was sent on missions sponsored by their ally, President Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia. His visits through Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East were intended to drum up support for their cause. In 1957, he was appointed as the FLN delegate to the United Nations. In 1958, he attended the North African Conference in Tunis, and in March, he communicated an appeal to the Vatican for their assistance in creating peace. After the collapse of the Fourth Republic and the coming to power of Charles de Gaulle, the hopes for an independent Algeria increased. This however did not end the fighting and on September 18 of that year, the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic (GPRA) was created. His political standing in Algeria and reputation as a moderate nationalist, acceptable to the West, helped him become president of this provisional Algerian nationalist government-in-exile on September 18, 1958, when it was created. The position of President was largely as a figurehead and a diplomat, as most of the power was wielded by the cabinet; however in time a number of Asian and African nations recognized the government. In October 1958, an attempt was made by both Abbas and de Gaulle at ending the war with a meeting and intended cease-fire, but it was dashed by the inability of the parties to agree on a neutral location. By September 16, 1959, de Gaulle was softening as he offered self-determination to be decided by a referendum four years after a cease-fire. This plan was generally accepted; unfortunately, there were a few substantial sticking points. By 1960, Abbas was becoming frustrated with the West as he lashed out at the United Kingdom and the United States for supplying weaponry to France. With talks breaking down in June 1960, Abbas turned to the east and by September was visiting with Communist China, and the Soviet Union, where he was welcomed warmly. Abbas reassured the West by stating that his new alliances were opportunism, when he stated that

We prefer to defend ourselves with Chinese Arms than to allow ourselves to be killed by the arms of the West.

On August 27, 1961, he resigned and Benyoucef Ben Khedda took his place. He then subsequently joined Ahmed Ben Bella&#x27;s and Houari Boumédiène&#x27;s Oujda Group in opposition to the GPRA, which was subsequently dismantled.

Due to Pakistan&#x27;s support to the cause of Algerian struggle for independence and self-determination, Ferhat Abbas was given a Pakistani diplomatic passport for his foreign travels.

== After independence ==

Algeria gained independence on July 5, 1962, and from September 25, 1962, to September 15, 1963, Ferhat Abbas was president of the constitutional assembly, but this institution was rapidly sidelined by Ben Bella, who had gained the presidency. Abbas resigned in protest at the FLN&#x27;s decision to write the constitution outside of the constituent assembly&#x27;s authority. He was subsequently expelled from the FLN, and was then placed under house arrest from 1964 until 1965.

In March 1976, he signed a statement alongside Benyoucef Benkhedda that called for a democratic constituent assembly against the country&#x27;s powerful military-backed President, Col. Houari Boumédiènne and was again placed under house arrest. Still, he received official recognition in the form of a state decoration, the &quot;Medal of Resistance&quot;, on October 30, 1984. Abbas died in his sleep on 24 December 1985. He is buried at the El Alia Cemetery.

== Writings ==
Articles written in his youth are collected in &quot;Le Jeune Algérien: de la colonie vers la province&quot; (The Young Algerian: From Colony to Province) (1931). His ideas on democracy and views on history were set out in a series of essays including &quot;La nuit coloniale&quot; (The Colonial Night) (1962), &quot;Autopsie d&#x27;une guerre&quot; (Autopsy of a War) (1980) and &quot;L&#x27;indépendance confisquée&quot; (1984).

== Personal life ==
Ferhat enjoyed soccer, horseback riding, and reading, in particular, Victor Hugo and Sophocles. He married Marcelle Stöetzel, an Algerian-born French national on 17 September 1945. Halim was their only child, a son.

<text>Grandcamp-Maisy () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

==Geography==
Grandcamp-Maisy is located on the coast, northeast of Isigny-sur-Mer and west of Pointe du Hoc. It is an active fishing port, with a fish market located on the harbour side.

==History==
On 1 November 1972, the commune formerly known as Grandcamp-les-Bains amalgamated with Maisy (Its old INSEE code was 14392) and changed its name to Grandcamp-Maisy.

===World War II===

In 1944 the town of Maisy was the site of a hidden German heavy artillery battery and the headquarters for the sector. Until early in the 21st century, the site was overgrown and had been covered by US engineers before the end of 1944 - well before any historians had a chance to examine the site.

British military historian Gary Sterne rediscovered the site after finding an American invasion map, and purchased the site and turned it into a museum with over 2 miles of original German trenches and bunkers.

From his research and released (previously top secret) papers, the site is many times larger than was originally thought. The labyrinth of trenches and tunnels had remained hidden for around 60 years. It contains office bunkers, supplies buildings, general quarters, radio rooms, and many other blocks, including an underground hospital (one of three which has been uncovered and can be visited).

It may well be that when all the site is cleared and all the bunkers that are buried are rediscovered, this site will be one of the largest on the Atlantic Wall in the invasion area. The sheer size of the site poses many questions as to why it does not feature more prominently in Allied records - or why it was so well camouflaged - equally why the site did not have more attention paid to it by the Allies.

The site was bombed, but not hit to any extent before D-Day. On the morning of 6 June 1944, claimed to have put the guns out of action, but Maisy was hit with shells for a further three days by many navy ships. The three casemates on the left side of the site (La Martinière) show no sign of damage from the front, only superficial damage from the east when the Rangers attacked across the fields on foot. This was the direction from which the battery was attacked by the men of the 5th Rangers on the morning of 9 June - along with halftracks from the 2nd Btn.

Despite this, in the Royal Navy &quot;History of D-Day&quot; it states that HMS &quot;Hawkins&quot; silenced the battery on D-Day, despite the fact that many other ships claimed to have done the same thing over many days. &quot;Hawkins&quot; also claimed to have put the battery at St Martin de Varreville out of action, but it is a well-known fact that the guns were not there on the morning of D-Day and had been moved further inland. The town became the headquarters of General Bradley after it was liberated on 9 June.

The site has been excavated and was opened as a museum in April 2007.

<text>Hendrik Christoffel &quot;Henk&quot; van de Hulst (19 November 1918 – 31 July 2000) was a Dutch astronomer.

In 1944, while a student in Utrecht, he predicted the existence of the 21 cm hyperfine line of neutral interstellar hydrogen. After this line was discovered, he participated, with Jan Oort and Lex Muller, in the effort to use radio astronomy to map out the neutral hydrogen in our galaxy, which first revealed its spiral structure. Motivated by the scattering in cosmic dust, he studied light scattering by spherical particles and wrote his doctoral thesis on the topic, subsequently formulating the anomalous diffraction theory.

He spent most of his career at Leiden University, retiring in 1984. He published widely in astronomy, and dealt with the solar corona, and interstellar clouds. After 1960 he was a leader in international space research projects.

In 1956 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<doc id="630894" wikidata="Q505270" url="?curid=630894" title="Cleveland Abbe">
<text>Cleveland Abbe (December 3, 1838 – October 28, 1916) was an American meteorologist and advocate of time zones.

While director of the Cincinnati Observatory in Cincinnati, Ohio, from 1871-1916, he developed a system of telegraphic weather reports, daily weather maps, and weather forecasts. In 1870, Congress established the U.S. Weather Bureau and inaugurated the use of daily weather forecasts. In recognition of his work, Abbe, who was often referred to as &quot;Old Probability&quot; for the reliability of his forecasts, was appointed the first head of the new service.

==Early life and education==
Cleveland Abbe was born in New York City in 1838 and grew up in the prosperous merchant family of George Waldo and Charlotte Colgate Abbe. One of his younger brothers, Robert, became a prominent surgeon and radiologist. In school, Cleveland excelled in mathematics and chemistry, attending David B. Scott Grammar School, and graduating in 1857 from the Free Academy with a Bachelor of Arts. While at City College, he learned under Oliver Wolcott Gibbs. 

He tutored mathematics at the Trinity Latin School in New York City in 1857 and 1858. He then taught engineering, as an assistant professor at the University of Michigan in 1859, followed by a tutoring job, also in engineering, until he left in 1860. During this stay in Michigan, he also was studying astronomy under Franz Brünnow from 1858 to 1859. He received his second degree, a Master of Arts in 1860, from City College. When the US Civil War broke out, he tried to join the Union Army; however, he failed the vision test, due to myopia, and spent the war years in Cambridge, Massachusetts, attending Harvard, and working as an assistant to Benjamin Gould, astronomer and head of the Longitude Department of the United States Coast Survey. He received his Bachelor of Science degree from Harvard in 1864, which also marked the end of his working at the U.S. Coast Survey. It was while in Cambridge that he rubbed shoulders with scientists from the Nautical Almanac, specifically, William Ferrel, which probably piqued his meteorological curiosity. 

He then studied abroad in Russia at the Observatory of Pulkovo, as a guest, and returned, in 1866, to the U.S. eager to study astronomy. It was said that he was his happiest while in Russia as like-minded intellectuals surrounded him, formed a relationship with Otto Struve, and enjoyed the scenery. 

==Career==
His first job in astronomy was at the United States Naval Observatory from 1867-1868 as an aide, until the Cincinnati Astronomical Society offered him the director position at the Cincinnati Observatory in 1868. He spent a few years in Cincinnati, but his interests were already evolving. Remembering that meteorological conditions directly affected the work of astronomers, he began working in the field of meteorology. He won approval to report on and predict the weather, working on the premise that forecasts could and should be generated at minimal expense and in such a way as to perhaps even produce income. By 1873 he was let go by the Cincinnati Observatory due to funding issues and it was then that he made the decision that would change his career path.

===Meteorology===

His first work on weather was centered on forecasting and issuance of warnings for severe weather. This preliminary work was started while still in Cincinnati. His first bulletin was issued on 1 September 1869. 

Abbe was appointed chief meteorologist at the United States Weather Bureau on 3 January 1871, which at the time was part of the U.S. Signal Corps. One of the first things that he addressed was the forecasting dimension of meteorology. He recognized that predicting the weather required a widespread, yet coordinated team. And so with short-term funding granted from the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, he enlisted twenty volunteer weather observers to help report conditions. Western Union agreed to permit the observers to communicate without charge, and Abbe and his team went to work. He selected data-collecting instruments that would be critical to the success of weather predicting, and he trained Army observer sergeants in their use. Field data was transmitted using code designed to minimize word count. Each message started with a station location, with code words for temperature, pressure, dew point, precipitation and wind direction, cloud observations, wind velocity and sunset observations.
At the designated times, information flooded the transmission stations. Clerks would then decode and record the messages and manually enter data onto weather maps, which were then used to predict the weather.

On February 19, 1871, Abbe personally gave the first official weather report. He continued to forecast alone for the next six months, while simultaneously training others. He was joined in mid-1871 by two Army lieutenants and a civilian professor in giving reports, and the team was then able to rotate the heavy workload. Abbe demanded precise language in the forecasts and ensured that every forecast covered four key meteorological elements: weather (clouds and precipitation), temperature, wind direction, and barometric pressure. By the end of the first year of reporting, over 60 copies of weather charts had been sent to Congress, the press, and various scientific institutions. By 1872, Abbe regularly sent over 500 sets of daily maps and bulletins overseas in exchange for European meteorological data. Abbe also insisted on verifying predictions. During the first year of operation, in 1871, Abbe and his staff verified 69 percent of their predictions; the annual report apologized for the other 31 percent, citing the time constraints as the cause.

In 1872, Abbe founded and was the initial editor of the &quot;Monthly Weather Review&quot;. He also was the editor from 1892 until 1915 just before his death. The Mount Weather Observatory in Virginia also produced a weather bulletin, of which Abbe was the editor from 1909 to 1913.

In order to compile his information, Abbe required a time-keeping system that was consistent among the stations. To accomplish this he divided the United States into four standard time zones. In 1879, he published a paper titled &quot;Report on Standard Time&quot;. In 1883, he convinced North American railroad companies to adopt his time-zone system. In 1884, Britain, which had already adopted its own standard time system for England, Scotland, and Wales, helped gather international consent for global time. In time, the American government, influenced in part by his 1879 paper, adopted the time-zone system.

Abbe required that the weather service stay at the forefront of technology. Over time, the instrument division at the headquarters tested and calibrated thousands of devices and even began to design and build their own instruments. By the end of the century, self-registering equipment came into use, and the United States led the meteorological world with 114 Class I (automatic recording) observation stations. Anticipating an increase in international cooperation, Abbe began to seek quality instruments calibrated to international standards. He enlisted Oliver Wolcott Gibbs of Harvard and Arthur Wright of Yale to design improved equipment. For comparison purposes, Abbe ordered a barometer from Heinrich Wild (director of the Nicholas Central Observatory in Russia), as well as an anemometer and several types of hygrometers from Germany. Abbe then invented an anemobarometer to test the effect of chimney and window drafts on barometers in enclosed spaces.

Abbe returned to academia in 1886, when he accepted a professorship at Columbian University, where he taught meteorology and remained until 1905. He was a regular lecturer at Johns Hopkins from 1896 through 1914. He has authored nearly 300 scientific papers. He was the recipient of three honorary degrees. His original school of higher learning, the City College of New York awarded him a PhD in 1891, in 1888 the University of Michigan gave Abbe an LL D as did the University of Glasgow in 1896. Harvard University gave him the S.B. degree in 1900.

Abbe was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1871. Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1884. In 1912 the Royal Meteorological Society presented him with their Symons Gold Medal, citing his contribution &quot;to instrumental, statistical, dynamical, and thermo dynamical meteorology and forecasting.&quot; In 1916 he was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences, which also gave him the Marcellus Hartley Medal. He was also one of the 33 founders of the National Geographic Society.

==Personal life and death==
In 1870 he married Frances Martha Neal who died in 1908. In 1909 he married Margaret Augusta Percival. Abbe enjoyed ethnology, oriental archaeology, geology, botany, and music in his off time.

Abbe died in 1916 aged 77 years in Chevy Chase, MD after more than 45 years of scientific achievement. He was buried in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

==&quot;Monthly Weather Review&quot;==
Cleveland Abbe founded the scientific journal &quot;Monthly Weather Review&quot; in 1872. The &quot;Monthly Weather Review&quot; began as a government publication under the United States Army Signal Corps. In 1891, the Signal Office&#x27;s meteorological responsibilities were transferred to the Weather Bureau under the United States Department of Agriculture. The Weather Bureau published the review until 1970, when the bureau became part of the newly formed National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA published the review until the end of 1973. Since 1974, this well-respected scientific journal has been published by the American Meteorological Society.

<text>Grangues () is a commune in the Calvados department and Normandy region of north-western France.

==Population==
==Name==
The attested forms are &quot;de Girangis&quot;, without date (cartulary of Préaux) ; &quot;Granchae&quot; in 1198 (magni rotuli scacc. p. 58, 2) ; &quot;[Johannes de] Guerengues&quot; in 1216 (AC, H 321); &quot;[Apud] Grengueis&quot; in 1220 ; &quot;Grengues&quot; in 1282 (AN, J 220,2) ; &quot;Greyngues&quot; in 1282 (cart. norm. n° 996, p. 256) ; &quot;Granges Generenciæ&quot; in the 13th century (cart. of Préaux) ; &quot;Grenguez&quot; 14th century ; &quot;Grenchiæ&quot; 16th century (Lisieux, p. 52).

This is a medieval toponymic formation, probably old since it is not preceded by the definite article. François de Beaurepaire brings Grangues closer to Goring (Oxford, &quot;Garinges&quot; 10th century); Goring (Sussex, &quot;Garinges&quot; 10th century) and Gerringe (Denmark, &quot;Gaeringhe&quot; 1470), without specifying the etymology. The two British Gorings admit as etymology, either &quot;property of the family or relatives of a man called &quot;*Gāra&quot;, an unattested Old English personal name, followed by the Germanic suffix &quot;-ingas&quot;, or “the people at the end, from the corner of the piece of land”, on Old English &quot;gāra&quot; &#x27;piece of land&#x27; + suffix &quot;-ingas&quot;. The Old Norse word &quot;geiri&quot; influenced by the Old English &quot;gāra&quot; &#x27;piece of land, probably triangular&#x27; &gt; &quot;gaire&quot;, is well attested in Norman toponymy, generally it gave the microtoponyms La Gare or La Guerre.

<doc id="630901" wikidata="Q196937" url="?curid=630901" title="Graye-sur-Mer">
<text>Graye-sur-Mer is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region, in northwestern France, approximately 1 km west of Courseulles-sur-Mer, and 18 km east of Bayeux.

The commune probably acquired its name from an old landed estate in its vicinity owned by Anchetil de Greye, a Norman chevalier and vassal of William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford, one of the great magnates of early Norman England, and one of the very few proven companions of William the Conqueror known to have fought at the Battle of Hastings in 1066.

==World War II==
===D-Day: at dawn===

On D-Day, not garrisoned as a defensible strong point, Graye-sur-Mer, lay in the shadow of fighting at the German Stongpoint: Stützpuntkte (StP) at Courseulles-sur-Mer, and for one more day under the ‘influence&#x27; of Ost-Bataillon 441./Infanterie-Division 716. The 7th Canadian Infantry (Assault) Brigade (Group) landing on D-Day, on the Mike and Nan Green beaches, would liberate Graye-sur-Mer, greatly benefiting from the Naval Bombardment Programme, about which the arriving Canadians had complained early in the day. Graye-sur-Mer, liberated early on 06.06.1944, was the object of several notable tactical engagements on D-Day, before the day was concluded. The citizens getting their first taste of something at 06h30 (Paris Time) when naval bombardment began to their west at Ver-Sur-Mer and then took up to their southeast at 06h52 (Paris Time). Not knowing it was the Normandy Landings, the sound of war got closer to the village at 08h45 (Paris Time) when the French Destroyer Escort La Combattante (FNFL) began to shell Hameau Vaux and Hameau de la Valette. The first Canadians to see action in Graye-sur-Mer was &#x27;C&#x27; Company, The Canadian Scottish Regiment in ‘destroying&#x27; the German Resistance Nest at Breche Le Bisson and ‘capturing&#x27; the Château de Vaux. The village was ‘liberated&#x27; by &#x27;D&#x27; Company, Royal Winnipeg Rifles just after 10 AM (Paris Time, The ‘Little Black Devils&#x27; clearing the town, and quickly moving off to Banville.

D-Day Operation Neptune: The Naval Bombardment was set out within a deliberate timetable, to ensure that naval gunfire could eliminate targets inland, threatening the landing beaches. Operation NEPTUNE was the kick-off, toward the liberation of France, it was the amphibious phase of Operation OVERLORD. In the NEPTUNE Plan, the landing of troops and continuing neutralization of enemy batteries was the direct responsibility of Allied Naval and Air Support. As the citizens of Graye-sur-Mer were woken up by the sounds of guns, not far from their homes, its two components could not have been distinguishable.

The &#x27;Counter Battery Fire Support&#x27; Programme, delivered by the Royal Navy: (BBF) Bombardment Force ‘E&#x27; Juno Beach (x2 targets) and (BBF) Bombardment Force ‘G&#x27; Gold Beach (x2 targets), delivered first counter battery fire.


The Beach Drenching Fire Programme was set out in a rigorous framework to ensure that indirect fire was brought to the right beach, at the right time. For the three 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade beaches, Task Force J - Assault Group J1, was controlled by LSH HMS Lawford (Captain Assault Group J1 - Fire Support Area ‘Y&#x27;). HMS Venus (a Hunt Class - Destroyer Escort) was held in Reserve and two Fleet Class – Destroyers, as was planned, were not to fire in support of the 7 CIB Landings. The Commander 7 CIB commenting that &quot;the terrific devastation which was to have been caused by bombing of the coast defense on either side of the River Seulles did not materialize. The only damage visible from the sea was that effected by our self-propelled artillery fire from LCAs.&quot;


===D-Day: around noon===

 Widerstandnesten WN 33a Hameau de Vaux (Breche Le Buisson) was located at North 49°20&#x27;30.88&quot; / West 00°29&#x27;41.37&quot; and in June 1944, for targeting purposes, at: LZ1 vT MR Grid 9449862 (Ref. GSGS 4250 1:50K: Creully Sheet 7E/5). The (WN) - Resistance Nest at the Breche Le Bisson was a small ‘platoon-sized&#x27; position, attempting to fill the tactical gap, at the ‘Divisional&#x27; Sector boundaries of KVU-Gr. Meuvaines (325 Inf-Div) and KVU-Gr. Seulles (716 Inf-Div). It sat isolated on an open stretch of sand dune, sited between WN31 Couseulles-sur-Mer (CA Juno Sector) and WN33 Ver-sur-Mer (UK Gold Sector). A Type Heer R677 Casement was built for an 8.8 cm Pak 43/41 (no gun installed), a Type Heer H612 Embrasure ‘Open&#x27; Casemate (Field Artillery / Anti-Tank Gun), was under construction, it housed a 75-mm FK 16 nA Gun, and an MG Shartenständ - Heavy MG (was under construction) being placed to cover a land approach. WN 33a was manned by Kompanie 1./ Ost-Bataillon 441, their company position, with several small field constructed bunkers, sat located to its rear in Hameau de Vaux (le Buission). ‘C&#x27; Company, The Canadian Scottish Regiment, had the task of taking WN 33a, and they worked hard to get there. &#x27;C&#x27; Company (OC Major D.G. Crofton) landing at 07h50, at MIKE Green, under machine gun and mortar fire, quickly covered 75–100 yards of beach, to the dunes. MIKE was an area of coastal deposition where the dunes had built up until they were between one hundred and two hundred yards deep. On Mike Green, beyond the dunes, the area inland tended to be damp and liable to flood. A series of drainage ditches had been dug to help drain the land. Passing through a tactical minefield, with not much of a fight, WN 33a was easily overcome, their objective knocked-out by earlier naval bombardment. As prior to the Canadian landings, Assault Group J1 - Beach Bombardment Drenching Fire had neutralized the 75-mm gun. Their first objective taken ‘C&#x27; Company moved onto the Château de Vaux (Aérium de Graye), accommodating the headquarters of Kompanie 1./ Ost-Batl 441. The Canadian Scottish Regiment (7 CIB Reserve) companies coming ashore, under sporadic mortar fire, the beach exits not yet complete, had to fight through scattered resistance, just beyond the beaches. Their primary opponent the &#x27;volunteered&#x27; soldiers of Ost-Bataillon 441.

Ost-Bataillon 441. (Ukrainian) Stab: Southwest of Ver-sur-Mer: At de Mars-Fontaine (KVU-Gr Meuvaines Defence Sector). Headquartered to the west of Graye-sur-Mer, Ost-Bataillon 441. (Ukrainian) had deployed two of its companies well west of la Seulles, focused on Mont Fleury and La Riviere, and two companies astride la Seulles, they focused on Courseulles-sur-Mer. The Canadians engaged these later two companies on D-Day, from the sea and beyond their beaches. Ost-Bataillon 441 (formed on 15.01.1943) transferred into Normandy as Heerestruppen (AOK 7 Reserve) on 19.01.1944. Being sent forward, first to the Bayeux area attached to 352. Infanterie-Div (on 19.03.1944) and then to the Meuvaines area, and attached to 716 Infanterie-Div (on 29.05.1944). Arriving ‘late&#x27; in the Graye-sur-Mer area, Ost-Bataillon 441., was positioned at a ‘Regimental Boundary&#x27; in Infanterie-Division 716, its four companies divided to fight in two different ‘Battalion KVU-Gruppe Defence Sectors&#x27;. 
*From MIKE Green, the Canadian Scottish Regiment moving south, bypassed the fight for WN31 Courseulles-sur-Mer (Westen), keeping well west of the Seulles, quickly passed through Kompanie 1./ Ost-Batl 441., at Hameau de Vaux (Le Buisson – Aérium de Graye). Located beyond the poorly drained wet lands behind the beach, it had abandoned its position receiving Beach Drenching Fire from HMS Venus (RN) and La Combattante (FNFL). La Combattante, commanded by Commandant André Patou, was a Hunt (Type III) Escort Destroyer, commissioned on 30.12.1942 (as FNFL), was lost to a sea bottom anchored LMB mine, in the Humber Estuary, on 23.02.1945. 
*From NAN Green, shortly delayed by the second fight for WN29 Courseulles-sur-Mer (Osten), bypassing the fight for WN30 Courseulles-sur-Mer (Süden), the Regina Rifles Regiment encountered Kompanie 2. / Ost-Batl 441., positioned south of Courseulles-sur-Mer at Les Rotys (at N 49.313Deg / W 0.455Deg). Blocking their approach, it did not cause much delay, weakened by Beach Drenching Fire from HMS Stevenstone (RN) and HMS Venus (RN), and having &#x27;lost elements&#x27; ordered to join Kompanie 8. / II 736., at Les Ruines St Ursin, at La Tomblette.

The second wave companies of The Regina Rifle Regiment (NAN Green), The Royal Winnipeg Rifles (MIKE Red) and The Canadian Scottish (MIKE Green), experiencing different fights, beyond their beaches, expected the 88mm (Flak 16 Aircraft Artillery Gun, with a maximum rate of fire of 15 shells/min) to remain a serious threat throughout the day. An organized line of four anti-tank weapon positions had been set out in their paths, which would not develop the delay planned. The Assault Group J1 - Beach Drenching Fire Programme did such damage that the Canadians quickly moved beyond its Beachhead Objective Line (YEW), with fewer casualties than anticipated.

*14. (PaK) Kompanie / Grenadier-Regiment 726. at Hameau de Vaux (le Buisson) is not geo-located in sources (by a French Lambert Conic LZ1 vT MR Grid). Retained in the KVU-Gr.Meuvaines Sector, by the Kdr Grenadier-Regiment 726., (having given up three Battalions to Inf.Div. 352.), as found in sources, it was located forward of Bataillon Stab II./726, at Hameau de Vaux, south of WN33a. Sited in fortifications of log crib timber, earth field construction, Assault Group J1 Beach Drenching Fire neutralized the three &#x27;small&#x27; anti-tank guns.
**Zug - 14 (PaK) Ko./726 deployed x2 7.5 cm PaK at le Buisson, to the rear of the left flank of Ko 1./Ost Bn 441. If it had not been destroyed it would have fired on &#x27;C&#x27; Company, Canadian Scottish. 
**Zug - 14 (PaK) Ko./726 deployed x1 7.5 cm PaK) at Aérium de Graye, to the rear of the right flank of Ko 1./Ost Bn 441. If it had not been destroyed it would have fired on &#x27;C&#x27; Company, Canadian Scottish.
*Panzerjäger-Abteilung 716./ Kompanie 2. ordered established on 25 Dec 1943, consisted of two platoons each with x3 7.5 cm ATk guns, and one platoon with x2 8.8 cm ATk guns. Its three platoons deployed consistent with the Division Commanders direction that &quot;… all available immobile weapons should be built in, should cover the beach and the sea, and should be able to observe these directly; they should therefore be placed in the most advanced line or very close behind it, as was for instance the Second Divisional Anti-Tank Company.&quot; (Generalleutnant Richter GOC 716 ID, Narrative: The Battle of 716 Inf Div in Normandy). As he noted, &quot;It can be seen from Appendices &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; that this anti-tank company (2/716) was deployed in small parcels close to the coast in the Canadian assault sector. It is not geo-located in sources (with a French Lambert Conic LZ1 vT MR Grid). ‘Evidently, it was destroyed (by Beach Drenching Fire.)&#x27; 
** Züg - Kompanie 2. /Pz.Jg-Abt 716., sited just west of Graye-sur-Mer, in the Hameau de la Valette, it manning x3 7.5 cm Pak 40, in an open field emplacement. If it had not been destroyed it would have fired on &#x27;D&#x27; Company, Canadian Scottish.
** Züg - Kompanie 2. /Pz.Jg-Abt 716., sited east of Graye-sur-Mer, southeast of Courseulles-sur-Mer, in an open field emplacement, it manning x3 7.5 cm Pak 40 on Les Champs des Fers (at N49.320 Deg / W 0.434 Deg). If it had not been destroyed it would have fired on &#x27;D&#x27; Company, The Regina Rifle Regiment.
** Züg - Kompanie 2. /Pz.Jg-Abt 716., sited well east of Graye-sur-Mer, southwest of Bernières-sur-Mer: on Les Perruques, in an open field emplacement, it manning x2 8.8 cm Pak 43/41[50]. Perhaps not destroyed, it would have fired on Le Régiment de la Chaudière, exiting Bernières, as it did 19th Cdn (Army) Field Regiment (hitting x3 SP 105 mm guns ... destroying all three in less than a minute).
While surrounded by arriving Canadians, Graye-sur-Mer was not the object of a damaging tactical engagement on D-Day, its ‘liberation&#x27; almost uneventful, coming very early in the morning. 
* &#x27;D&#x27; Company, Royal Winnipeg Rifles, (OC Major L. Fulton), landing on MIKE Green at 07h49 BST, west of WN 31, quickly moved off the beach and cleared a path through a minefield at Hameau La Vallette. By 09h00 BST, heading for Graye-sur-Mer, the ‘Little Black Devils&#x27; cleared the town, and moved off, some sections making good progress to Banville. 
*&#x27;D&#x27; Company, Canadian Scottish Regiment (OC Major Ewan), from MIKE Red, struck inland at 08h30, taking the route of an open exit, and moved up between Hameau La Valette and Graye-sur-Mer. The Princess Mary&#x27;s first objective was to seize the bridges over the Seulles, south of the town, at MR 928819 (D12 La Seulles: Pont Ouest) and MR 953817 (D12 La Seulles: Pont Est) (LZ1 vT MR Grid French Lambert Conic). 
* Delayed by limited beach exits, the engineers able to clear a path and complete a causeway, at 09h20 &#x27;A&#x27; Squadron, 1st Hussars, began to move toward their first objective, Graye-sur-Mer.
* After some delay in getting off the beaches, Bde HQ 7 CIB arrived in Graye-sur-Mer at 12h15 BST, “... rather surprised that they were in battle with the result that it took time to shake down as a HQ.” The Brigade Commander&#x27;s party had landed about 09h30 and moved to the Main Beach Signal Station, that would act as the headquarters communications centre, waiting for the Brigade Main Headquarters and its Signals Troop. Brigade Main Headquarters arrived, the Bde HQ moved off and “... spent the night at 927808 COLUMBIERS-SUR-SEULLES, ...”. Graye-sur-Mer was freed.

<doc id="630904" wikidata="Q150142" url="?curid=630904" title="2807 Karl Marx">
<text>2807 Karl Marx, provisional designation , is a carbonaceous Dorian asteroid from the central region of the asteroid belt, approximately 17 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 15 October 1969, by Russian astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnyj on the Crimean peninsula. The asteroid was later named for the German philosopher Karl Marx.

== Orbit and classification ==

=== Dora family ===

&quot;Karl Marx&quot; is a member of the Dora family (), a well-determined asteroid family of more than 1,200 known members with a carbonaceous composition. The family&#x27;s namesake is 668 Dora. It is alternatively known as the &quot;Zhongolovich family&quot;, named after its presumably largest member 1734 Zhongolovich. The Dora family may also contain a subfamily.

=== Orbit and observation arc ===

It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.3–3.3 AU once every 4 years and 8 months (1,707 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.18 and an inclination of 8° with respect to the ecliptic.

The asteroid was first identified as at Heidelberg Observatory in 1924. Its first used observation is a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in 1954, extending the body&#x27;s observation arc by 15 years prior to its official discovery observation at Nauchnyj.

== Physical characteristics ==

In the SMASS classification, &quot;Karl Marx&quot; is classified as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid. According to the survey carried out by NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, &quot;Karl Marx&quot; measures 16.9 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.057.

=== Lightcurves ===

As of 2017, no rotational lightcurve of &quot;Karl Marx&quot; has been obtained. The body&#x27;s rotation period and shape remains unknown.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after German philosopher, economist and revolutionary socialist Karl Marx (1818–1883), student of the theories about society, economics and politics, and author of &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, the foundational theoretical text of modern communist thought. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 24 July 1983 ().

<text>The Lycoteuthidae are a family of squid comprising three known genera. They are small muscular squid, characterised by a lack of hooks and by photophores present on the viscera, eyeballs and tentacles. They inhabit tropical and subtropical seas where the diel migrants stay down in the mesopelagic zone during the day and migrate to the surface to feed at night. Some species show strong sexual dimorphism.

<text>Henry Eugene Abbey (June 27, 1846 – October 17, 1896) was an American theatre manager and producer.

==Early life==
Henry E. Abbey was born in Akron, Ohio on June 27, 1846, to clockmaker Henry Stephen Abbey and Elizabeth Smith Abbey. He engaged in business with his father, a jeweller, until 1869, when he leased the Akron Opera House.

==Career==
During the 1870s - 1890s, he managed such prominent Broadway theatres as Booth&#x27;s, Wallack&#x27;s, Abbey&#x27;s Theatre and Abbey&#x27;s Park Theatre promoting the talents of some of the foremost American actors of his day, as well as European stars. In 1882 with John B. Schoeffel and Maurice Grau he formed the theatrical management partnership of Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau.

Abbey was the first lessee and manager of the inaugural season in 1883 of the &#x27;old&#x27; Metropolitan Opera House, with Grau&#x27;s own Opera Company and stars. The season was a critical success but a financial flop. Abbey as manager was personally responsible for losses of $250,000. Christina Nilsson&#x27;s and Marcella Sembrich&#x27;s cachets, known to be high, explain 40% of this losses.

He managed the tours of Adelina Patti, Francesco Tamagno and the London Gaity in America, and he introduced Sarah Bernhardt to America. He opened Boston&#x27;s Park Theatre in 1879. He also opened Abbey&#x27;s Theatre in 1890, one of the first theatrical managers to present expensive shows outside of the major cities.

Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau returned to the &#x27;Met&#x27; in 1891, and Abbey continued as manager there until his death. He died in New York City on October 17, 1896, at the age of 50.

==Legacy==
One of his longest lasting legacies was his bringing a group of Spanish performers, known as the Spanish Students, to the United States. These performers inspired imitators and gave rise to the widespread playing of the mandolin in the United States, where it was previously unknown.

==Personal life==
He married Kate Kingsley in 1876, and had two children with her. He married again in 1886, to the actress Florence Gerard. She appeared at the new Wallack&#x27;s Theatre at 30th Street and Broadway while Abbey was manager there.

<text>Madawaska—Restigouche is a federal electoral district in New Brunswick, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1997. Its population in 2021 was 60,184.

==Political geography==
The district includes all of the County of Madawaska (except Saint-André) and all of the County of Restigouche except the extreme eastern part.

The neighbouring ridings are Miramichi, Tobique—Mactaquac, Rimouski-Neigette—Témiscouata—Les Basques, Haute-Gaspésie—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia, and Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine.

In 2008, Liberal support was focused in the eastern and central parts of the riding, particularly in Edmundston, Campbellton, and Dalhousie. Support for the Conservatives was centered in the western part of the riding, in a strip of land bordering both Maine and Quebec. There was also a pocket of Tory support outside Saint-Leonard. The NDP won six polls in the riding, all in the Dalhousie area, a community they won.

The electoral district was created in 1996 from Madawaska—Victoria and from Restigouche—Chaleur ridings. This riding gained a small amount of territory from Miramichi as a result of the 2012 federal electoral redistribution.

==Members of Parliament==

This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:




==Election results==


This riding gained some territory from Miramichi for the 42nd Canadian federal election.

<doc id="630922" wikidata="Q751779" url="?curid=630922" title="Astronomical Society of the Pacific">
<text>The Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP) is an American scientific and educational organization, founded in San Francisco on February 7, 1889, immediately following the solar eclipse of January 1, 1889. Its name derives from its origins on the Pacific Coast, but today it has members all over the country and the world. It has the legal status of a nonprofit organization.

It is the largest general astronomy education society in the world, with members from over 40 countries.

==Education and outreach programs==

The ASP&#x27;s mission is to promote public interest in and awareness of astronomy (and increase scientific literacy) through its publications, web site, and many educational and outreach programs.

* The NASA Night Sky Network – a community of more than 450 astronomy clubs across the U.S. that share their time and telescopes to engage the public with unique astronomy experiences. The ASP provides training and materials to enhance clubs outreach activities, and inspires more than four million people through their participation in 30,000+ plus events.
* Eclipse Ambassadors Off the Path is a NASA partner program to prepare 500 communities off the path of the 2024 Total Eclipse with the awe and science of solar eclipses. Partnering eclipse enthusiasts and undergraduate students create new partnerships with underserved audiences in their community. 
* Reaching for the Stars: NASA Science for Girl Scouts – The ASP is partnered on a NASA project to create new astronomy badges for Girl Scouts, connect them with their local astronomy clubs, and train amateur astronomers to make their outreach more girl-friendly. The ASP also connects adult Girl Scout volunteers to NASA&#x27;s Night Sky Network (NSN).
* My Sky Tonight – a set of research-based, science-rich astronomy activities that engage pre-kindergarten aged children, and trained hundreds of educators at museums, parks, and libraries across the U.S. on how to effectively engage their youngest visitors (ages 3–5) in astronomy.
* The AAS Astronomy Ambassadors Program – provides mentoring and training experiences for young astronomers just starting their careers. The American Astronomical Society, in partnership with the ASP, members of the Center for Astronomy Education (CAE), and other organizations active in science education and public outreach, has created the program, which involves a series of professional-development workshops and a community of practice designed to help improve participants communication skills and effectiveness in doing outreach to students and the public.
* On-the-Spot Assessment – a research-to-practice initiative led by the ASP (in collaboration with Oregon State University, the Portal to the Public Network via the Institute for Learning Innovation, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory) to develop a set of embedded assessment strategies and professional development to support research scientists in effectively communicating science to the public.
* The Galileoscope Project – Developed in 2009 for the International Year of Astronomy, the Galileoscope has become the centerpiece for teaching about telescopes in many programs. As a key component of the Galileo Teacher Training Program, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific engaged hundreds of educators in professional development related to telescopes and the Galileoscope.
* Project PLANET – Leveraging resources developed as a part of the My Sky Tonight project to explore their usefulness in a formal, classroom setting.
* Project ASTRO – a national program that improves the teaching of astronomy and physical science (using hands-on inquiry-based activities) by pairing amateur and professional astronomers with 4th through 9th grade teachers and classes.
* Family ASTRO – a project that develops kits and games to help families enjoy astronomy in their leisure time and trains astronomers, educators, and community leaders.
* Astronomy from the Ground Up (AFGU) – Providing informal science educators and interpreters with new and innovative ways to communicate astronomy. AFGU is a growing community of hundreds of educators from museums, science centers, nature centers, and parks around the U.S., who are actively enhancing and expanding their capacity to address astronomy topics for their visitors.
* Classroom activities, videos, and resources in astronomy (many developed by the Society&#x27;s educational staff) are sold through their online AstroShop or made available free through the website. 

The ASP assists with astronomy education and outreach by partnering with other organizations both in the United States and internationally, and organizes an annual meeting to promote the appreciation and understanding of astronomy.

==Publications==
The society promotes astronomy education through several publications. The Universe in the Classroom, a free electronic educational newsletter for teachers and other educators around the world who help students of all ages learn more about the wonders of the universe through astronomy.

Mercury, the ASP&#x27;s quarterly on-line membership magazine, covers a wide range of astronomy topics, from history and archaeoastronomy to cutting-edge developments. First published in 1925 as the &quot;Leaflets of the ASP&quot;, &quot;Mercury&quot; is now disseminated to thousands of ASP members and schools, universities, libraries, observatories, and institutions around the world. Mercury Online, a publicly accessible companion blog for &quot;Mercury&quot;, was established in 2019 &quot;to showcase articles by our expert columnists after they&#x27;ve been published in Mercury magazine.&quot; 

The ASP also publishes the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (PASP) aimed at professional astronomers. The &quot;PASP&quot; is a technical journal of refereed papers on astronomical research covering all wavelengths and distance scales as well as papers on the latest innovations in astronomical instrumentation and software, and has been publishing journals since 1889.

The Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series (ASPCS) is a series of over 400 volumes of professional astronomy conference proceedings. Started in 1988, the Conference Series has grown to become a prominent publication series in the world of professional astronomy publications, and has published over 500 volumes. Volumes are sold to the attendees of the conferences of which the proceedings are published, as well as being offered through the Astronomical Society of the Pacific&#x27;s AstroShop, and can be found in the libraries of major universities and research institutions worldwide. In 2004, the ASPCS stepped into electronic publishing, offering electronic access subscriptions for libraries and institutions, as well as individual access to volumes which they have purchased in hard copy form.

AstroBeat is an on-line ASP-membership column, which comes out every other week, and features a behind-the-scenes report on some aspect of astronomical discovery, astronomy education, or astronomy as a hobby, written by a key participant. Authors have included:
* Clyde Tombaugh, retelling the story of his discovery of the (dwarf) planet Pluto
* Michael E. Brown, discussing the naming of the dwarf planet Makemake
* Noted astronomical photographer David Malin describing the transition from chemical to digital photography
* Virginia Louise Trimble explaining how she selected her list of the top ten astronomical discoveries of the last thousand years.

==Awards==
The ASP makes several different awards annually:
*The Bruce Medal for lifetime contribution to astronomy research. The medal is named after Catherine Wolfe Bruce.
*The Klumpke-Roberts Award for outstanding contributions to the public understanding and appreciation of astronomy, named for Dorothea Klumpke-Roberts.
*The Gordon Myers Amateur Achievement Awards (formerly the Amateur Achievement Award), in recognition of significant contributions to astronomy by one not employed in the field of astronomy in a professional capacity.
*The Bart Bok Award, named in honor of astronomer Bart Bok, awarded jointly with the American Astronomical Society to outstanding student projects in astronomy at the International Science and Engineering Fair.
*The Thomas Brennan Award for exceptional achievement related to the teaching of astronomy at the high school level.
*The Maria and Eric Muhlmann Award for recent significant observational results made possible by innovative advances in astronomical instrumentation, software, or observational infrastructure. 
*The Robert J. Trumpler Award, named in honor of astronomer Robert J. Trumpler, given to a recent recipient of a Ph.D degree with a particularly notable thesis. 
* The Richard Emmons Award is given for a lifetime of contributions to the teaching of astronomy to college non-science majors. 
* The Las Cumbres Amateur Outreach Award, established by Wayne Rosing and Dorothy Largay, seeks to honor outstanding educational outreach by an amateur astronomer to K-12 children and the interested lay public.
* The Arthur B.C. Walker II Award, first announced in 2016, for research and teaching with a substantial commitment to students from underrepresented groups.

==Defunct awards==
*The Donohoe Comet Medal (1890–1950). In July 1889 the ASP announced that a bronze medal for &quot;the actual discovery of any unexpected comet&quot; would be awarded on the basis of a $500 gift by Joseph A. Donohoe of San Francisco. The first award was made in March 1890 to W. R. Brooks for the discovery of the comet now known as 16P/Brooks. After the 250th medal had been awarded in 1950 the award was discontinued because photography had enabled the discovery of too many comets.
*The Comet Medal (1969–1974). In 1968 the ASP Board voted to create a new Comet Medal to be awarded once yearly to recognize &quot;an outstanding nonprofessional astronomer&quot; for &quot;past contributions to the study of comets.&quot; The first award was made in 1969 to Reginald L. Waterfield. After 1974, the Comet Medal was discontinued.

<text>Hérouville-Saint-Clair () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

It is a suburb of the city of Caen, and lies adjacent to it in a northeasterly direction, along the west side of the Canal de Caen à la Mer. Its inhabitants are called &quot;Hérouvillais&quot;.

Just across the canal from Hérouville is a Renault Trucks manufacturing plant, which is situated between the canal and the Orne River. Just east of the river is the town of Colombelles.

&quot;Hérouville&quot; was the commune name until 1957.

==Population==
Hérouville-Saint-Clair experienced a very fast development which made it the most populous suburb of Caen. A simple village at the beginning of 1960, the commune passed from fewer than 2,000 inhabitants to almost 25,000 in less than fifteen years. This figure has varied little since 1975.

<text>The 2004 Malaysian Grand Prix (officially the 2004 Petronas Malaysian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 21 March 2004 at the Sepang International Circuit. It was Race 2 of 18 in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship. The race was won by Michael Schumacher for Ferrari. This was also the first podium for future World Champion Jenson Button, who finished in 3rd place.

==Friday drivers==
The bottom 6 teams in the 2003 Constructors&#x27; Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.
== Race report==
With all drivers starting on dry tyres, the action started sooner than expected as on the parade lap Kimi Räikkönen spun but was able to retake his grid position. Mark Webber, starting from P2, made a woeful start and slid down the field to be 9th by the 1st lap. Fernando Alonso on the other hand, made a brilliant start from 19th (2nd last) and was up behind Webber in 10th after lap 1. Michael Schumacher led from the start while drivers behind jostled for position. By the second lap, rain started to fall and cars were starting to lose traction on the dry tyres. Jarno Trulli overtook Button but the Brit promptly took the place back again. Alonso barreled past Webber for eighth and closed in on the McLaren of David Coulthard. From the back to a points position within four laps was an outstanding performance from Alonso but it was the best he got all race.
By this time Michael Schumacher had already built up quite an advantage, but this was quickly eroded by the hard-charging Juan Pablo Montoya. It was to prove to be just a brief shower as soon the precipitation passed and Schumacher was back on his way.

Webber managed to get past Ralf but the Williams retaliated and got ahead again, puncturing the Jaguar&#x27;s rear right tyre on his way. Takuma Sato spun into the gravel but recovered the BAR smartly and Webber had to pit for a tyre change. To add insult to injury he got a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane and finally compounded his misery by spinning out of the race a few laps later.

A string of cars in the midfield were jostling for position, starting with Nick Heidfeld&#x27;s Jordan in 11th, then Cristiano da Matta&#x27;s Toyota, the second Jaguar of Christian Klien, Sauber&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella and da Matta&#x27;s teammate Olivier Panis. In the first round of pit stops Heidfeld&#x27;s fuel rig failed and he had to go out and back in again. He eventually pulled into the pits to retire with a gearbox problem.

Trulli got ahead of Coulthard in the first stops and running order at the front, where not much was happening, was Michael, Montoya, Räikkönen. Montoya was falling away from the Ferrari in the second stint of the race but not letting him get too far ahead. Alonso took Coulthard for sixth but then the pair pitted for the second time and the McLaren got out ahead.

Alonso swapped to a two-stop strategy but it gave him no advantage and he seemed resigned to staying behind Coulthard, while Trulli, who had been on quite an early charge, also seemed to lose momentum. Ralf&#x27;s engine unexpectedly gave up midway through the race, the first failure for BMW for 17 races. Felipe Massa, who was having a pretty good race, got held up by a Minardi and did a bit of agitated hand waving as he went by. The gap between Michael and Montoya was holding at around four seconds and Button moved up to third, jumping Räikkönen in the second pit stops. Both of the Finn&#x27;s stops seemed quite long and eventually he pulled off to the side of the track with a transmission failure. Disappointing for Räikkönen and McLaren as Kimi was showing good pace until then.

Panis ducked into the pits only to find no crew ready for him and had to go straight back out. Then next lap he was back in again to serve a drive-through for speeding on his previous effort. Not a good day for Panis, or Toyota in general. Da Matta finished ninth after a fairly anonymous race.

In the final laps the BAR crew froze as one of the cars pulled off with an engine failure but it was Sato rather than third placed Button. Bad luck for Sato but the relief that it wasn&#x27;t his teammate was palpable. Barrichello was gaining ground on Button but with only a few laps to go, he was not in a position to challenge.

Michael took the win with Montoya five seconds behind. BAR and Button were by far the happiest of the lot and the Englishman got the biggest cheer from the crowd as he lifted his first trophy on the third step of the podium.

<text>In molecular biology, a library is a collection of genetic material fragments that are stored and propagated in a population of microbes through the process of molecular cloning. There are different types of DNA libraries, including cDNA libraries (formed from reverse-transcribed RNA), genomic libraries (formed from genomic DNA) and randomized mutant libraries (formed by de novo gene synthesis where alternative nucleotides or codons are incorporated). DNA library technology is a mainstay of current molecular biology, genetic engineering, and protein engineering, and the applications of these libraries depend on the source of the original DNA fragments. There are differences in the cloning vectors and techniques used in library preparation, but in general each DNA fragment is uniquely inserted into a cloning vector and the pool of recombinant DNA molecules is then transferred into a population of bacteria (a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome or BAC library) or yeast such that each organism contains on average one construct (vector + insert). As the population of organisms is grown in culture, the DNA molecules contained within them are copied and propagated (thus, &quot;cloned&quot;).

==Terminology==
The term &quot;library&quot; can refer to a population of organisms, each of which carries a DNA molecule inserted into a cloning vector, or alternatively to the collection of all of the cloned vector molecules.

===cDNA libraries===
A cDNA library represents a sample of the mRNA purified from a particular source (either a collection of cells, a particular tissue, or an entire organism), which has been converted back to a DNA template by the use of the enzyme reverse transcriptase. It thus represents the genes that were being actively transcribed in that particular source under the physiological, developmental, or environmental conditions that existed when the mRNA was purified. cDNA libraries can be generated using techniques that promote &quot;full-length&quot; clones or under conditions that generate shorter fragments used for the identification of &quot;expressed sequence tags&quot;.

cDNA libraries are useful in reverse genetics, but they only represent a very small (less than 1%) portion of the overall genome in a given organism.

Applications of cDNA libraries include:
* Discovery of novel genes
* Cloning of full-length cDNA molecules for &quot;in vitro&quot; study of gene function
* Study of the repertoire of mRNAs expressed in different cells or tissues
* Study of alternative splicing in different cells or tissues

===Genomic libraries===
A genomic library is a set of clones that together represents the entire genome of a given organism. The number of clones that constitute a genomic library depends on (1) the size of the genome in question and (2) the insert size tolerated by the particular cloning vector system. For most practical purposes, the tissue source of the genomic DNA is unimportant because each cell of the body contains virtually identical DNA (with some exceptions).

Applications of genomic libraries include:
* Determining the complete genome sequence of a given organism (see genome project)
* Serving as a source of genomic sequence for generation of transgenic animals through genetic engineering
* Study of the function of regulatory sequences &quot;in vitro&quot;
* Study of genetic mutations in cancer tissues

===Synthetic mutant libraries===
In contrast to the library types described above, a variety of artificial methods exist for making libraries of variant genes. Variation throughout the gene can be introduced randomly by either error-prone PCR, DNA shuffling to recombine parts of similar genes together, or transposon-based methods to introduce indels.
Alternatively, mutations can be targeted to specific codons during &quot;de novo&quot; synthesis or saturation mutagenesis to construct one or more point mutants of a gene in a controlled way. This results in a mixture of double stranded DNA molecules which represent variants of the original gene.

The expressed proteins from these libraries can then be screened for variants which exhibit favorable properties (e.g. stability, binding affinity or enzyme activity). This can be repeated in cycles of creating gene variants and screening the expression products in a directed evolution process.

==Overview of cDNA library preparation techniques==

===DNA extraction===
If creating an mRNA library (i.e. with cDNA clones), there are several possible protocols for isolating full length mRNA. To extract DNA for genomic DNA (also known as gDNA) libraries, a DNA mini-prep may be useful.

===Insert preparation===
cDNA libraries require care to ensure that full length clones of mRNA are captured as cDNA (which will later be inserted into vectors). Several protocols have been designed to optimise the synthesis of the 1st cDNA strand and the 2nd cDNA strand for this reason, and also to make directional cloning into the vector more likely.

gDNA fragments are generated from the extracted gDNA by using non-specific frequent cutter restriction enzymes.

===Vectors===
The nucleotide sequences of interest are preserved as inserts to a plasmid or the genome of a bacteriophage that has been used to infect bacterial cells.

Vectors are propagated most commonly in bacterial cells, but if using a YAC (Yeast Artificial Chromosome) then yeast cells may be used. Vectors could also be propagated in viruses, but this can be time-consuming and tedious. However, the high transfection efficiency achieved by using viruses (often phages) makes them useful for packaging the vector (with the ligated insert) and then introducing them into the bacterial (or yeast) cell.

Additionally, for cDNA libraries, a system using the Lambda Zap II phage, ExAssist, and 2 E. coli species has been developed. A Cre-Lox system using loxP sites and the in vivo expression of the recombinase enzyme can also be used instead. These are examples of in vivo excision systems. In vitro excision involves subcloning often using traditional restriction enzymes and cloning strategies. In vitro excision can be more time-consuming and may require more &quot;hands-on&quot; work than in vivo excision systems. In either case, the systems allow the movement of the vector from the phage into a live cell, where the vector can replicate and propagate until the library is to be used.

==Using libraries==
This involves &quot;screening&quot; for the sequences of interest. There are multiple possible methods to achieve this.

<doc id="630938" wikidata="Q645862" url="?curid=630938" title="2830 Greenwich">
<text>2830 Greenwich (&quot;prov. designation&quot;: ) is a bright Phocaea asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt. It was discovered on 14 April 1980, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Lowell&#x27;s U.S. Anderson Mesa Station, Arizona, and named for the historical Royal Greenwich Observatory in England. The stony S-type asteroid has a long rotation period of 24 hours and measures approximately in diameter

== Classification and orbit ==

&quot;Greenwich&quot; is a member of the Phocaea family (), a group of asteroids with similar orbital characteristics. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.9–2.9 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,340 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21 and an inclination of 25° with respect to the ecliptic. It was first identified as at Crimea-Nauchnij in 1969, extending the asteroid&#x27;s observation arc by 11 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.

== Naming ==

This minor planet is named for the Royal Greenwich Observatory, home of the Astronomer Royal and located in the London borough of Greenwich, England. The naming took place on the occasion of the centennial of its adoption as &quot;the Greenwich prime meridian for longitude and time&quot;. Founded for naval purposes in 1675, the Royal Observatory quickly became a leading institution in astronomy. In 1884, the prime meridian finally became a worldwide standard. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 15 May 1984 ().

== Physical characteristics ==

In the Tholen taxonomy, &quot;Greenwich&quot; is classified as a stony S-type asteroid.

=== Lightcurves ===

In May 2002, a photometric lightcurve analysis by French amateur astronomer Christophe Demeautis gave an ambiguous rotation period of 24 hours with a brightness variation of 0.5 in magnitude ().

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the surveys carried out by NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, &quot;Greenwich&quot; measures between 7.9 and 9.5 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo between 0.17 and 0.19. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; adopts Petr Pravec&#x27;s revised WISE-results, that is, a diameter of 9.252 kilometer with an albedo of 0.1865 and an absolute magnitude of 12.61.

<text>George E. Norcross III (born March 16, 1956) is an American businessman, organizer, and political boss. A member of the Democratic Party, Norcross is considered a power broker in southern New Jersey.

Norcross is executive chairman of Conner Strong &amp; Buckelew, an insurance and benefits brokerage. He is chairman of the board of trustees for Cooper University Health Care System, MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper and Cooper University Hospital, all in Camden, New Jersey, and has served as a trustee since 1990. He led the effort to create the Cooper Medical School of Rowan University and to partner with MD Anderson Cancer Center to create the MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper, which opened in 2013.

Norcross has been a prominent political leader in New Jersey for more than 30 years, since before he became chairman of the Camden County Democratic Committee in 1989, a position he held until 1993. For many years, he was named one of the most powerful non-elected political figures in New Jersey by the website PolitickerNJ.com. 

Norcross was a member of the Democratic National Committee until 2021 when he changed his voter registration to Florida. He formerly belonged to Mar-a-Lago, the club owned by United States President Donald Trump.
In June 2024, Norcross was indicted on 13 charges of racketeering and criminal enterprise by State Attorney General Matthew Platkin.

==Early life==
Norcross was born on March 16, 1956, in Cooper University Hospital, Camden, New Jersey, the son of George E. Norcross Jr. (1928-1998), the president of the AFL–CIO Central Labor Union of Camden and Gloucester Counties, and his wife, Anne Carol Norcross (1931-2016). His father was active in the community of Camden, served as a board member of Cooper University Hospital, and chaired the board of Camden County&#x27;s United Way.

Norcross graduated from Pennsauken High School and briefly attended Rutgers University–Camden. He has three brothers: Donald, a United States Congressman representing New Jersey&#x27;s 1st congressional district; Philip, managing partner of the law firm Parker McCay; and John, a psychologist, author, and professor at the University of Scranton.

==Career==

===Insurance===
Norcross is the executive chairman of insurance, risk management, and employee benefits brokerage and consulting firm Conner Strong &amp; Buckelew, where he has worked since 1979. Norcross was named the second most powerful man in the New Jersey business world by NJBiz.com in 2014, 2015, and 2016, and made the list&#x27;s top ten list in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. In September 2015, Norcross was announced as one of the local investors in The Camden Waterfront, a $1 billion development on Camden&#x27;s waterfront initially developed by Liberty Property Trust and designed by Robert A.M. Stern. Norcross said he would invest $50 million in the project, and in March 2017, Norcross announced his company would move to the Camden waterfront as part of a $245 million development.

===Cooper University Health Care System===
Norcross is chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Cooper University Health Care System, Cooper University Hospital and the MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper, in Camden, New Jersey. He has served as a Cooper trustee since 1990. Norcross launched the Cooper Medical School of Rowan University and helped to facilitate the opening of the MD Anderson Cooper Cancer Center in October 2013.

In the wake of the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014, Cooper announced a &quot;Veterans VIP Priority Program&quot; that provided day care to veterans in New Jersey&#x27;s seven southern counties. In November 2014, Cooper and Norcross were awarded the &quot;Seven Seals&quot; award by the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve in recognition of the program.

In February 2012, Norcross penned an op-ed in the &quot;Courier-Post&quot; praising the idea of merging Rowan University and Rutgers-Camden. In June that year, the state approved the partnership.

===Formica Freitag Bakery===
In January 2022, Norcross and his family became majority partners in the Formica Bakery, a maker of &quot;Atlantic City Original&quot; bread which had fallen into bankruptcy in 2019. It was subsequently renamed Formica Freitag Bakery, and merged with Valitni&#x27;s Italian Bakery of Pleasantville in 
January 2023. 

===Politics===
Norcross was considered the &quot;political boss&quot; of the &quot;Democratic machine&quot; in New Jersey, particularly in South Jersey. He held significant sway over local party organizations, fundraising, and candidates&#x27; access to the county line. Norcross was chairman of the Camden County Democratic Party from 1989 to 1995 and was a prolific fundraiser, with influence over many county jobs and contracts. Journalist Steve Kornacki wrote in 2011, &quot;It’s not written down anywhere, but it’s acknowledged by everyone (privately, of course): You don’t run for office as a Democrat in South Jersey unless George is OK with it—and you don’t win in the fall without him.&quot; In tapes leaked in 2005, Norcross was recorded saying he could secure allies with jobs and punish political opponents. Norcross allegedly attempted to have a town&#x27;s solicitor fired because he ran for a local party chairmanship, pressuring the town&#x27;s mayor with threats to his private job.

By 2003, Norcross held influence over more than a dozen powerful state legislators and controlled government contracts through a pay-to-play system that directed businesses&#x27; donations to campaigns; In 2009, Norcross was instrumental in the ousting of Richard Codey as senate president in favor of his childhood friend Stephen Sweeney. Governor Jon Corzine&#x27;s loss to Chris Christie in the 2009 gubernatorial election was credited in part to Norcross&#x27;s not having used his machine to mobilize voters for Corzine. Norcross subsequently had a positive relationship with the Republican governor.

In 2021, Sweeney, then president of the New Jersey Senate, and one of Norcross&#x27;s closest allies, lost re-election. &quot;Politico&quot; said that the loss indicated a substantial decline in Norcross&#x27;s power and influence. In 2023, he announced that he was decreasing his involvement in politics, saying it was &quot;time for others to lead&quot; and conceding that Sweeney&#x27;s loss had left him &quot;sitting in the backseat&quot;.

==Criticism==
The office of the Attorney General of New Jersey and the United States Attorney&#x27;s office under Chris Christie investigated Norcross after he was secretly taped discussing state politics. After investigation and significant media coverage, he was not charged. Norcross was also the subject of a federal investigation in 2016 where his phones were wiretapped. The United States Attorney&#x27;s Office for New Jersey sent Norcross a letter confirming that no action was warranted and the investigation was closed.

Norcross has been associated with businesses that are alleged to have received special treatment from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.

An investigative task force was formed to look into the operations and procedures of the NJEDA. Norcross sued the State of New Jersey to stop the highly critical report from becoming public. After a five-hour court hearing about the injunction, Norcross lost and within minutes, the report was made public.

==Racketeering charges==
On June 17, 2024, New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin unsealed a thirteen-count racketeering indictment against Norcross and five other individuals, including his brother, Philip. The indictment accused Norcross and the other defendants of conspiring to illegally obtain waterfront property and property rights, unlawfully collecting millions of dollars in government tax credits, and attempting to influence and control public officials.

On July 9, 2024, Norcross and his 4 co-defendants were in Mercer County Courthouse in Trenton, New Jersey. They all pleaded not guilty. Norcross&#x27;s lawyer, Michael Critchley, &quot;emphatically&quot; said he was not guilty to Superior Court Judge Peter E. Warshaw Jr. 

==Personal life==
Norcross has two children. He was previously listed as a resident of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, but in 2023, Norcross was reported to be an official resident of Florida, living there &quot;about 90 percent of [the] time&quot;.

Norcross was listed as one of the state&#x27;s wealthiest people, ranked 41st in New Jersey in 2015 with a net worth of almost $250 million.

<text>Vila Velha (; ) is a Brazilian municipality located in the state of Espírito Santo. It lies across from Vitória, the state capital. Its population was 467,722 (2022) and its area is 210.23 km2.

==Geography==

Vila Velha forms part of the Greater Vitória metropolitan area. To the north is Vitória, to the west Cariacica and Viana, to the south Guarapari, and to the east the Atlantic Ocean.
The Deputy Darcy Castelo de Mendonça Bridge, known as Third Bridge (Portuguese: Terceira Ponte), is the second tallest bridge in Brazil, connecting and reducing the distance between the cities of Vila Velha and Vitória.

The Jacarenema Ecological Reserve, a conservation area established in 1997, lies along the coast to the south of the main city and contains the mangrove estuary of the Jucu River.
The Morro do Penedo Natural Monument protects a granite rock mass about high on the coast of Vitória Bay.

==Economy==

Notable corporations in Vila Velha include Garoto, one of Brazil&#x27;s largest chocolate manufacturers.

Vila Velha has been through several years of intense real estate development and several luxury buildings are now a common sight in all of its main beaches. Some critics argue that this practice can be considered excess urbanization of a previously low-profile area, despite the economic benefits.

==History==
* Vila Velha is the oldest township in Espírito Santo. It was founded as (&quot;Village of the Holy Spirit&quot;) on 23 May 1535 by Vasco Fernandes Coutinho, the first captain of Espírito Santo. (The nickname &quot;Green Shins&quot; given to people from Vila Velha originated from the green algae that stuck to the legs of sailors returning from shore to Coutinho&#x27;s ship.) He was forced to return to Portugal around 1550 in order to recruit new colonists, as there were not enough to sustain the colony. Upon his return, however, he discovered that there had been violent disputes between the colonists, slaves, and natives, which had forced most inhabitants to flee to the island of Vitória. In response, Coutinho relocated the capital to Vitória. Afterward, Vila Velha remained a quiet town until quite recently; the 1828 census, for example, showed only 1,250 people in the town. Today, however, Vila Velha is the biggest city in the entire state of Espírito Santo and has approximately 500,000 inhabitants.

<doc id="630945" wikidata="Q13343" url="?curid=630945" title="Moksha language">
<text>Moksha (, ) is a Mordvinic language of the Uralic family, spoken by Mokshas, with around 130,000 native speakers in 2010.
Moksha is the majority language in the western part of Mordovia.
Its closest relative is the Erzya language, with which it is not mutually intelligible. Moksha is also possibly closely related to the extinct Meshcherian and Muromian languages.

== History ==

=== Cherapkin&#x27;s Inscription ===

There is very little historical evidence of the use of Moksha from the distant past. One notable exception are inscriptions on so-called mordovka silver coins issued under Golden Horde rulers around the 14th century. The evidence of usage of the language (written with the Cyrillic script) comes from the 16th century.


===Indo-Iranian Influence===
== Dialects ==

The Moksha language is divided into three dialects:
* Central group (M-I)
* Western group (M-II)
* South-Eastern group (M-III)

The dialects may be divided with another principle depending on their vowel system:
* ä-dialect: Proto-Moksha *&quot;ä&quot; is retained: &quot;śeĺmä&quot; &quot;eye&quot;, &quot;t́äĺmä&quot; &quot;broom&quot;, &quot;ĺäj&quot; &quot;river&quot;.
* e-dialect: Proto-Moksha *&quot;ä&quot; is raised and merged with *&quot;e&quot;: &quot;śeĺme&quot; &quot;eye&quot;, &quot;t́eĺme&quot; &quot;broom&quot;, &quot;ĺej&quot; &quot;river&quot;.
* i-dialect: Proto-Moksha *&quot;ä&quot; is raised to , while Proto-Moksha *&quot;e&quot; is raised to and merged with *&quot;i&quot;: &quot;śiĺme&quot; &quot;eye&quot;, &quot;t́eĺme&quot; &quot;broom&quot;, &quot;ĺej&quot; &quot;river&quot;.

The standard literary Moksha language is based on the central group with &quot;ä&quot; (particularly the dialect of Krasnoslobodsk).

== Sociolinguistics ==

=== Official status ===

Moksha is one of the three official languages in Mordovia (the others being Erzya and Russian). The right to one&#x27;s own language is guaranteed by the Constitution of the Mordovia Republic. The republican law of Mordovia N 19-3 issued in 1998 declares Moksha one of its state languages and regulates its usage in various spheres: in state bodies such as Mordovian Parliament, official documents and seals, education, mass-media, information about goods, geographical names, road signs. However, the actual usage of Moksha and Erzya is rather limited.

=== Revitalisation efforts in Mordovia ===
Policies regarding the revival of the Moksha and Erzya languages in Mordovia started in the late 1990s, when the Language, and Education Laws were accepted. From the early 2000s on, the policy goal has been to create a unified Mordvin standard language despite differences between Erzya and Moksha.

However, there have been no executive programmes for the implementation of the Language Law. Only about a third of Mordvin students had access to Mordvin language learning, the rest of whom are educated through Russian. Moksha has been used as the medium of instruction in some rural schools, but the number of students attending those schools is in rapid decline. In 2004, Mordovian authorities attempted to introduce compulsory study of the Mordvin/Moksha as one of the Republic&#x27;s official languages, but this attempt failed in the aftermath of the 2007 education reform in Russia.

== Phonology ==
===Vowels===
There are eight vowels with limited allophony and reduction of unstressed vowels.
Moksha has lost the original Uralic system of vowel harmony but maintains consonant-vowel harmony (palatalized consonants go with front vowels, non-palatalized with non-front).

There are some restrictions for the occurrence of vowels within a word:
# is an allophone of the phoneme after phonemically non-palatalized (&quot;hard&quot;) consonants.
# does not occur after non-palatalized consonants, only after their palatalized (&quot;soft&quot;) counterparts.
# and do not fully contrast after phonemically palatalized or non-palatalized consonants.
#* Similar to , does not occur after non-palatalized consonants either, only after their palatalized counterparts.
#* After palatalized consonants, occurs at the end of words, and when followed by another palatalized consonant.
#* after palatalized consonants occurs only before non-palatalized consonants, i.e. in the environment .
# The mid vowels&#x27; occurrence varies by the position within the word:
#* In native words, are rare in the second syllable, but common in borrowings from e.g. Russian.
#* are never found in the third and following syllables, where only occurs.
#* at the end of words is only found in one-syllable words (e.g. &quot;ве&quot; &quot;night&quot;, &quot;пе&quot; &quot;end&quot;). In longer words, word-final always stands for (e.g. &quot;веле&quot; &quot;village&quot;, &quot;пильге&quot; &quot;foot, leg&quot;).

Unstressed and are slightly reduced and shortened and respectively.

===Consonants===
There are 33 consonants in Moksha.

 is realized as a sibilant before the plural suffix in south-east dialects.

Palatalization, characteristic of Uralic languages, is contrastive only for dental consonants, which can be either &quot;soft&quot; or &quot; hard&quot;. In Moksha Cyrillic alphabet the palatalization is designated like in Russian: either by a &quot;soft sign&quot; after a &quot;soft&quot; consonant or by writing &quot;soft&quot; vowels after a &quot;soft&quot; consonant. In scientific transliteration the acute accent or apostrophe are used.

All other consonants have palatalized allophones before the front vowels as well. The alveolo-palatal affricate lacks non-palatalized counterpart, while postalveolar fricatives lack palatalized counterparts.

====Devoicing====
Unusually for a Uralic language, there is also a series of voiceless liquid consonants: . These have arisen from Proto-Mordvinic consonant clusters of a sonorant followed by a voiceless stop or affricate: .

Before certain inflectional and derivational endings, devoicing continues to exist as a phonological process in Moksha. This affects all other voiced consonants as well, including the nasal consonants and semivowels. No voiceless nasals are however found in Moksha: the devoicing of nasals produces voiceless oral stops. Altogether the following devoicing processes apply:

For example, before the nominative plural :
* &quot;кал&quot; &quot;fish&quot; – &quot;калхт&quot; &quot;fish&quot;
* &quot;лем&quot; &quot;name&quot; – &quot;лепть&quot; &quot;names&quot;
* &quot;марь&quot; &quot;apple&quot; – &quot;марьхть&quot; &quot;apples&quot;
Devoicing is, however, morphological rather than phonological, due to the loss of earlier voiceless stops from some consonant clusters, and due to the creation of new consonant clusters of voiced liquid + voiceless stop. Compare the following oppositions:
* &quot;калне&quot; &quot;little fish&quot; – &quot;калхне&quot; (&lt; ) &quot;these fish&quot;
* &quot;марьне&quot; &quot;my apples&quot; – &quot;марьхне&quot; ( &lt; ) &quot;these apples&quot;
* &quot;кундайне&quot; &quot;I caught it&quot; – &quot;кундайхне&quot; ( &lt; ) &quot;these catchers&quot;

===Stress===
Non-high vowels are inherently longer than high vowels and tend to draw the stress. If a high vowel appears in the first syllable which follow the syllable with non-high vowels (especially and ), then the stress moves to that second or third syllable. If all the vowels of a word are either non-high or high, then the stress falls on the first syllable.

Stressed vowels are longer than unstressed ones in the same position like in Russian. Unstressed vowels undergo some degree of vowel reduction.

== Writing systems ==

Moksha has been written using Cyrillic with spelling rules identical to those of Russian since the 18th century. As a consequence of that, the vowels are not differentiated in a straightforward way. However, they can be (more or less) predicted from Moksha phonotactics. The 1993 spelling reform defines that in the first (either stressed or unstressed) syllable must be written with the &quot;hard&quot; sign (e.g. мъ́рдсемс &quot;mə́rdśəms&quot; &quot;to return&quot;, formerly мрдсемс). The version of the Moksha Cyrillic alphabet used in 1924-1927 had several extra letters, either digraphs or single letters with diacritics. Although the use of the Latin script for Moksha was officially approved by the CIK VCKNA (General Executive Committee of the All Union New Alphabet Central Committee) on June 25, 1932, it was never implemented.

==Grammar==
=== Morphosyntax ===
Like other Uralic languages, Moksha is an agglutinating language with elaborate systems of case-marking and conjugation, postpositions, no grammatical gender, and no articles.

==== Case ====
Moksha has 13 productive cases, many of which are primarily locative cases. Locative cases in Moksha express ideas that Indo-European languages such as English normally code by prepositions (in, at, towards, on, etc.).

However, also similarly to Indo-European prepositions, many of the uses of locative cases convey ideas other than simple motion or location. These include such expressions of time (e.g. on &quot;the table/Monday&quot;, in &quot;Europe/a few hours&quot;, by &quot;the river/the end of the summer&quot;, etc. ), purpose (to &quot;China/keep things simple&quot;), or beneficiary relations. Some of the functions of Moksha cases are listed below:

* Nominative, used for subjects, predicatives and for other grammatical functions.
* Genitive, used to code possession.
* Allative, used to express the motion onto a point.
*Elative, used to code motion out of a place.
*Inessive, used to code a stationary state, in a place.
*Ablative, used to code motion away from a point or a point of origin.
* Illative, used to code motion into a place.
*Translative, used to express a change into a state.
* Prolative, used to express the idea of &quot;by way&quot; or &quot;via&quot; an action or instrument.
* Lative, used to code motion towards a place.

There is controversy about the status of the three remaining cases in Moksha. Some researchers see the following three cases as borderline derivational affixes.

* Comparative, used to express a likeness to something.
* Caritive (or abessive), used to code the absence of something.
* Causal, used to express that an entity is the cause of something else.

===== Relationships between locative cases =====
As in other Uralic languages, locative cases in Moksha can be classified according to three criteria: the spatial position (interior, surface, or exterior), the motion status (stationary or moving), and within the latter, the direction of the movement (approaching or departing). The table below shows these relationships schematically:

== Media ==

=== Use in literature ===
Before 1917 about 100 books and pamphlets mostly of religious character were published. More than 200 manuscripts including at least 50 wordlists were not printed. In the 19th century the Russian Orthodox Missionary Society in Kazan published Moksha primers and elementary textbooks of the Russian language for the Mokshas. Among them were two fascicles with samples of Moksha folk poetry. The great native scholar Makar Evsevyev collected Moksha folk songs published in one volume in 1897. Early in the Soviet period, social and political literature predominated among published works. Printing of Moksha language books was all done in Moscow until the establishment of the Mordvinian national district in 1928. Official conferences in 1928 and 1935 decreed the northwest dialect to be the basis for the literary language.

=== Use in education ===
The first few Moksha schools were established in the 19th century by Russian Christian missionaries. Since 1973, Moksha has been allowed to be used as the language of instruction for the first three grades of elementary school in rural areas, and as an elective subject.
Classes in universities in Mordovia are in Russian, but the philological faculties of Mordovian State University and Mordovian State Pedagogical Institute offer a teacher course of Moksha. Mordovian State University also offers a course in Moksha for other humanitarian and some technical specialities. According to annual statistics from the Russian Ministry of Education for 2014-2015, there were 48 Moksha-medium schools (all in rural areas) where 644 students were taught, and 202 schools (152 in rural areas) where Moksha was studied as a subject by 15,783 students (5,412 in rural areas). Since 2010, the study of Moksha in Mordovian schools is not compulsory, but can be chosen only by parents.

<text>The Mastigoteuthidae, also known as whip-lash squid, are a family of small deep-sea squid. Approximately 20 known species in six genera are represented, with members found in both the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zone of most oceans. Originally described by Verill in 1881, it was later lowered by Chun (1920) to a subfamily (Mastigoteuthinae) of the Chiroteuthidae. However, Roper et al. (1969) raised it back to the family level, and this has not been changed since. The taxonomy of this family is extremely unstable, and there have been at times one genus, two genera and four subgenera(Salcedo-Vargas &amp; Okutani, 1994), two genera and several &#x27;groups&#x27; (Salcedo-Vargas, 1997), five genera and one species with an uncertain placement, or six genera.

== Description ==
Mastigoteuthids range in size from quite small species in the genus &quot;Mastigoteuthis&quot;, to relatively gigantic sizes in the genus &quot;Idioteuthis&quot;. However most are rather small, from 3–15 centimetres total mantle length. Their most distinctive features are their extremely elongate tentacles—which retract into membranous lateral sheaths of the fourth (and largest) arms—and their very large ovate fins, which may occupy up to 80% of the mantle length in some species. It is from these &#x27;whip-like&#x27; tentacles that their common name derives. Unlike most other squid, the club of the mastigoteuthid tentacle is not significantly (usually not at all) broader than the rest of the tentacle and is covered in very small suckers—in some species, invisible to the naked eye—which impart an extremely sticky property to the clubs, themselves answering for 70% or more of the tentacle&#x27;s length in some species.

Many species also possess photophores (bioluminescent organs) which may be located on either the skin, the surface of the eyeball, or the eyelid. These photophores have a &quot;lens&quot; of chromatophores, pigment cells which may allow the squid to modify the colour of the light produced by the photophores. The mantle of some species is adorned with conical or hemispherical tubercles. Most species have arm suckers that possess sharp or blunt conical teeth, which are either larger or present only on the distal side, however some species, such as &quot;Mastigoteuthis inermis&quot;, have smooth sucker rings with no teeth at all (however, the validity of this species is uncertain at the present time). Coloration is typically a rich reddish brown or dark purple.

Species in the genus &quot;Echinoteuthis&quot; and &quot;Idioteuthis&quot; are known to have expanded tentacular clubs as paralarvae (for both species) or adults (&quot;Idioteuthis&quot;).

== Behaviour ==

Members of this family have scarcely been observed in life, but at least two species (&quot;Mastigopsis hjorti&quot; and &quot;Magnoteuthis magna&quot;) are known to hover above the ocean bottom in a vertical orientation, the head pointing downward. The squid use their large fins to maintain this orientation and use both their extended tentacles like fly paper, held rigidly at a constant distance apart: this has been termed the &quot;tuning fork&quot; position. Prey items apparently consist primarily of benthic crustaceans.

Although mastigoteuthids possess ink sacs (which could suggest forays into shallower, lit waters), all observations have been over the bottom in deep water. Deep-sea squids commonly possess ink. The squid seem to lack the ability of rapid jet propulsion and instead rely on their large fins.

==Species==
This family is taxonomically little understood, but there have many recent advances in its systematics. With many species represented by single, damaged, and juvenile specimens, this group is still creating controversy in the taxonomic community. Salcedo-Vargas and Okutani (1994) reclassified the family and eliminated the genus &quot;Echinoteuthis&quot;, added two subgenera, and reduced the number of species to eight. Three years later, after the careful examination of skin tubercles and photophores, Salcedo-Vargas eliminated his subgenera, and increased the number of species to 17 (Salcedo-Vargas, 1997). 

According to the World Register of Marine Species the classification of the Mastigoteuthidae is:
* Genus &quot;Echinoteuthis&quot; 
**&quot;Echinoteuthis atlantica&quot; 
**&quot;Echinoteuthis danae&quot; 
**&quot;Echinoteuthis famelica&quot; 
*Genus &quot;Idioteuthis&quot; 
**&quot;Idioteuthis latipinna&quot; * 
**&quot;Idioteuthis cordiformis&quot; 
*Genus &quot;Magnoteuthis&quot; 
**&quot;Magnoteuthis magna&quot; 
**&quot;Magnoteuthis microlucens&quot; 
**&quot;Magnoteuthis osheai&quot; 
*Genus &quot;Mastigopsis&quot; 
**&quot;Mastigopsis hjorti&quot; 
*Genus &quot;Mastigoteuthis&quot;
**&quot;Mastigoteuthis agassizii&quot; 
**&quot;Mastigoteuthis dentata&quot; 
**&quot;Mastigoteuthis flammea&quot; 
**&quot;Mastigoteuthis glaukopis&quot; 
**&quot;Mastigoteuthis grimaldii&quot; 
**&quot;Mastigoteuthis psychrophila&quot; 
**&quot;Mastigoteuthis schmidti&quot; 
**&quot;Mastigoteuthis hastula&quot; * 
**&quot;Mastigoteuthis inermis&quot; * 
**&quot;Mastigoteuthis iselini&quot; * 
**&quot;Mastigoteuthis latipinna&quot; * 
**&quot;Mastigoteuthis okutanii&quot; * 
**&quot;Mastigoteuthis tyroi&quot; * 
*Genus &quot;Mastigotragus&quot;
**&quot;Mastigotragus pyrodes&quot; 

The taxa listed above with an asterisk (*) are &quot;taxon inquirendum&quot; and needs further study to determine if it is a valid taxon or a synonym.

The validity of several species remains to be reviewed, and the placement of the species &quot;Mastigotragus pyrodes&quot; in a separate genus should be assessed with genetics.

<text>Hiéville () is a former commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. On 1 January 2017, it was merged into the new commune Saint-Pierre-en-Auge.

==Population==
==Etymology==

French linguist René Lepelley writes that the etymology of Hiéville is similar to that of the commune Hiesville in the Manche department. Both names probably come from the word &#x27;hedo&#x27; (a Germanic personal name) and the Old French word &#x27;ville&#x27;, which originally referred to a rural estate or territory. Ville itself was derived from the Latin phrase &#x27;villa rustica,&#x27; a countryside home.

<text>La Hoguette () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

==Geography==

Five rivers run through the commune the Filaine, Gronde, Traine-feuilles, Trainefeuille and Bilaine.

The Commune has an area of woods known as Saint-André.

==Archeology==
La Hoguette is also the type site of the early Neolithic La Hoguette culture that is found mainly in association with Linear pottery (&quot;Linearbandkeramic&quot;) or Limburg pottery in Northern France, The Netherlands, Alsace and Western Germany. It is believed to ultimately derive from the Mediterranean Cardial culture traditions. Important sites of the La-Hoguette culture include Stuttgart-Wilhelma, Dautenheim and Godelau.

The La Hoguette pottery was found under a later megalithic tomb and first misidentified as Linearbandkeramic. La Hoguette marks the westernmost point of the distribution of this culture.
The place name La Hoguette is believed to derive from the Old Norse word &quot;Haugr&quot; meaning a knoll or a hill.

<text>Pieris rapae is a small- to medium-sized butterfly species of the whites-and-yellows family Pieridae. It is known in Europe as the small white, in North America as the cabbage white or cabbage butterfly, on several continents as the small cabbage white, and in New Zealand as the white butterfly. The butterfly is recognizable by its white color with small black dots on its wings, and it can be distinguished from &quot;P. brassicae&quot; by its larger size and the black band at the tip of its forewings.

The caterpillar of this species, often referred to as the &quot;imported cabbageworm&quot;, is a pest to crucifer crops such as cabbage, kale, bok choy and broccoli. &quot;Pieris rapae&quot; is widespread in Europe and Asia; it is believed to have originated in the Eastern Mediterranean region of Europe, and to have spread across Eurasia thanks to the diversification of brassicaceous crops and the development of human trade routes. Over the past two centuries, it spread to North Africa (about 1800), North America (1860s), Hawaii (1897), New Zealand (1930), and Australia (1937), as a result of accidental introductions.

==Description==
In appearance it looks like a smaller version of the large white (&quot;Pieris brassicae&quot;). The upperside is creamy white with black tips on the forewings. Females also have two black spots in the center of the forewings. Its underwings are yellowish with black speckles. It is sometimes mistaken for a moth due to its plain appearance. The wingspan of adults is roughly .

&quot;Pieris rapae&quot; has a wingbeat frequency averaging 12.8 flaps per second.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species has a natural range across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It was accidentally introduced to Quebec, Canada, around 1860 and spread rapidly throughout North America. The species has spread to all North American life zones from Lower Austral/Lower Sonoran to Canada. Estimates show that a single female of this species might be the progenitor in a few generations of millions. It is absent or scarce in desert and semidesert regions (except for irrigated areas). It is not found north of Canadian life zone, nor on Channel Islands off the coast of southern California. By 1898, the small white had spread to Hawaii; by 1929, it had reached New Zealand and the area around Melbourne, Australia, and found its way to Perth as early as 1943. It does not seem to have made it to South America.

In Britain, it has two flight periods, April–May and July–August, but is continuously brooded in North America, being one of the first butterflies to emerge from the chrysalis in the spring and flying until hard freeze in the fall.

The species can be found in any open area with diverse plant association. It can be seen usually in towns, but also in natural habitats, mostly in valley bottoms. Although an affinity towards open areas is shown, the small white is found to have entered even small forest clearings in recent years.

The nominate subspecies &quot;P. r. rapae&quot; is found in Europe, while Asian populations are placed in the subspecies &quot;P. r. crucivora&quot;. Other subspecies include &quot;atomaria&quot;, &quot;eumorpha&quot;, &quot;leucosoma&quot;, &quot;mauretanica&quot;, &quot;napi&quot;, &quot;novangliae&quot;, and &quot;orientalis&quot;.

==Life cycle==

The small white will readily lay eggs on both cultivated and wild members of the cabbage family, such as charlock (&quot;Sinapis arvensis&quot;) and hedge mustard (&quot;Sisymbrium officinale&quot;). &quot;P. rapae&quot; is known to lay eggs singularly on the host plant. The egg is characterized by a yellowish color and 12 longitudinal ridges. The egg production peaks about a week after adulthood in lab and the female can live up to 3 weeks. Females tend to lay fewer eggs on plants in clumps than on isolated plants. It has been suggested that isothiocyanate compounds in the family Brassicaceae may have been evolved to reduce herbivory by caterpillars of the small white. However, this suggestion is not generally accepted because the small white has later been shown to be immune to the isothiocyanate forming reaction due to a specific biochemical adaptation. In contrast, the small white and relatives seem to have evolved as a consequence of this biochemical adaptation to the isothiocyanate-forming glucosinolates.
Traditionally known in the United States as the imported cabbage worm, now more commonly the cabbage white, the caterpillars are bluish-green, with tiny black spots, a black ring around the spiracles, and a lateral row of yellow dashes, and a yellow middorsal line. Caterpillars rest on the undersides of the leaves, making them less visible to predators. Although the larval instars have not been fully studied, different instars are easily differentiated simply by comparing sizes, especially the head alone. During the first and second instar the head is entirely black; third instar has the clypeus yellow but the rest of the head black. In the fourth and fifth instar, there is a dark greenish-yellow dot behind each eye but with rest of the head black. However, the color of the caterpillar head does not necessarily indicate specific instar, as the time of color change is not fixed. In the larval stage, the small white can be a pest on cultivated cabbages, kale, radish, broccoli, and horseradish. The larva is considered a serious pest for commercial growth of cabbage and other Brassicaceae.
The pupa of &quot;P. rapae&quot; is very similar to that of &quot;P. napi&quot;. It is brown to mottled-gray or yellowish, matching the background color. It has a large head cone, with a vertical abdomen and flared subdorsal ridge. The two (pupa of &quot;P. rapae&quot; and &quot;P. napi&quot;) can be easily distinguished by comparing the proboscis sheath. In &quot;P. rapae&quot;, the proboscis sheath extends far beyond the antennal sheath while in &quot;P. napi&quot;, only a very short distance.

Like its close relative the large white, the small white is a strong flyer and the British population is increased by continental immigrants in most years. Adults are diurnal and fly throughout the day, except for early morning and evening. Although there is occasional activity during the later part of the night, it ceases as dawn breaks. Adult &quot;P. rapae&quot; can move many kilometers in individual flights. Adults have been observed to fly as much as 12 km in one flight. On average, a female flies about 0.7 km per day and moves 0.45 km from where she starts. Males patrol all day around host plants to mate with females.

==Behavior and ecology==

===Larva feeding and Role as Pests ===
The &quot;P. rapae&quot; larva is voracious. Once it hatches from the egg, it eats its own eggshell and then moves to eat the leaves of the host plant. It bores into the interior of the cabbage, feeding on the new sprouts. The larvae adjust their feeding rate to maintain a constant rate of nitrogen uptake. They will feed faster in low nitrogen environment and utilize the nitrogen more efficiently (at the cost of efficiency in other nutrients) than larvae hatched on nitrogen high host plant. However, no significant difference in growth rate was observed between larvae in the two environments. 
Considered a serious pest, the caterpillar is known to be responsible for annual damage worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.

The larvae are shown to disperse their damage on the plant. Larvae are shown to feed mostly during the day. They move around the plant mostly spending their time feeding. A feeding bout is immediately followed by a change in position, either to a new leaf or to another part of the same leaf. This dispersal of damage is seen as an adaptive behavior to hide the visual cues from predators that rely on vision. Even though &quot;P. rapae&quot; larvae are cryptic, they remain in the sun for the majority of the day, rather than hiding on the underside of the leaf. The condition of the host plant influences the larval growth significantly.

Larval duration, pupal weights, adult weights, and larval growth rates were significantly altered by both plant nutrient availability and plant species. Larvae preferred Brassicaceae plants over other host plants. Larvae that have previously fed on crucifers will refuse nasturtium leaves to the point of starving to death. Within the family Brassicaceae, larvae show no significant difference in feeding behavior; larvae placed on kale show no difference from larvae placed on Brussels sprouts.

Survival rates do not differ depending on nutrition availability of host plant. Elevated plant nutrient levels decrease larval duration and increase larval growth rate. The elevated nutrition level also decreased the fourth instar&#x27;s consumption rate and increased its food utilization efficiencies. Larvae on cultivated host plant was observed to have higher growth efficiency than those fed in foliage of wild species. In short, larvae fed on high nutrition foliage show shorter duration of development, less consumption rate, higher growth rate and food processing efficiency.

===Adult feeding===
Adult &quot;P. rapae&quot; use both visual and olfactory cues to identify flowers in their foraging flight. The cabbage butterfly prefers purple, blue and yellow flowers over other floral colors. Some flowers, like &quot;Brassica rapa&quot;, have a UV guide for aiding nectar search for the butterfly where the petals reflect near UV light whereas the center of the flower absorbs UV light, creating a visible dark center in the flower when seen in UV condition. This UV guide plays a significant role in &quot;P. rapae&quot; foraging.

The adult flies around feeding from nectars of the plant. The adult looks for certain colors among green vegetation (purple, blue, and yellow preferred to white, red and green) and extends the proboscis before landing. It probes for nectar after landing. The butterfly identifies the flower through vision and odor. Chemical compounds such as Phenylacetaldehyde or 2-Phenylethanol was shown to provoke reflex proboscis extension. The search for nectar is also limited by the memory constraint. An adult butterfly shows a flower constancy in foraging, visiting flower species that it has already experienced. The ability to find nectar from the flower increased over time, showing a certain learning curve. Furthermore, the ability to find nectar from the first flower species decreased if the adult butterfly started to feed nectar from other plant species.

===Courtship and reproduction===

The male, when it spots a female, zigzags up, down, below, and in front of her, flying until she lands. The male flutters, catches her closed forewings with his legs, and spreads his wings. This causes her to lean over. He usually flies a short distance with her dangling beneath him. An unreceptive female may fly vertically or spread her wings and raise the abdomen to reject the male. 
Most host plants of &quot;P. rapae&quot; contain mustard oils and females use these oils to locate the plants. Females then lay the eggs singly on host leaves. In the northern hemisphere, adults appear as early as March and they continue to brood well into October. Spring adults have smaller black spots on its wings and are generally smaller than summer adults.

Males seem to benefit from the sodium uptake through mud-puddling behaviour with an increase in reproductive success.

=== Host selection ===
All known host plants contain natural chemicals called glucosinolates, that are cues for egg laying. Host plants are: herb Cruciferae – &quot;Arabis glabra&quot;, &quot;Armoracia lapthifolia&quot;, &quot;Armoracia aquatica&quot;, &quot;Barbarea vulgaris&quot;, &quot;Barbarea orthoceras&quot;, &quot;Barbarea verna&quot;, &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot;, &quot;Brassica rapa&quot;, &quot;Brassica caulorapa&quot;, &quot;Brassica napus&quot;, &quot;Brassica juncea&quot;, &quot;Brassica hirta&quot;, &quot;Brassica nigra&quot;, &quot;Brassica tula&quot;, &quot;Cardaria draba&quot;, &quot;Capsella bursa-pastoris&quot; (females oviposit but larvae refuse it), &quot;Dentaria diphylla&quot;, &quot;Descurainia Sophia&quot;, &quot;Eruca sativa&quot;, &quot;Erysimum perenne&quot;, &quot;Lobularia maritima&quot;, &quot;Lunaria annua&quot; (retards larval growth), &quot;Matthiola incana&quot;, &quot;Nasturtium officinale&quot;, &quot;Raphanus sativus&quot;, &quot;Raphanus raphanistrum&quot;, &quot;Rorippa curvisiliqua&quot;, &quot;Rorippa islandica&quot;, &quot;Sisymbrium irio&quot;, &quot;Sisymbrium altissimum&quot;, &quot;Sisymbrium officinale&quot; (and var. &quot;leicocarpum&quot;), &quot;Streptanthus tortuosus&quot;, &quot;Thlaspi arvense&quot; (larvae grow slowly or refuse it); Capparidaceae: &quot;Cleome serrulata&quot;, &quot;Capparis sandwichiana&quot;; Tropaeolaceae: &quot;Tropaeolum majus&quot;; Resedaceae: &quot;Reseda odorata&quot;.

There are three phases to host selection by the &quot;P. rapae&quot; adult female butterfly: searching, landing, and contact evaluation. A gravid female adult will first locate suitable habitats, and then identify patches of vegetation that contain potential host plants. The cabbage butterflies seem to limit their search to open areas and avoid cool, shaded woodlands even when host plants are available in these areas. Furthermore, gravid females will not oviposit during overcast or rainy weather. In laboratory conditions, high light intensity is required to promote oviposition. The females fly in a linear path independent of wind direction or position of the sun.

==== Host plant searching behavior ====
Pre-mating females do not display host plant searching behavior. The behavior starts soon after mating. Flight behavior of an ovipositing female of &quot;P. rapae&quot; follows the Markov process. Females foraging for nectar will readily abandon a linear path; they will show tight turns concentrating on flower patches. Females searching for host plant, however, will follow a linear route. As a result of directionality, the number of eggs laid per plant declines with increases in host plant density. The average move length declined as host plant density increases, but the decline is not enough to concentrate eggs on a dense host plant. Although females avoid laying eggs on plants or leaves with other eggs or larvae in a lab condition; this discrimination is not shown in field conditions.

Adult females may search for a suitable Brassicaceae over a range of 500 m to several kilometers.

Small differences in flight patterns have been observed in Canadian and Australian &quot;P. rapae&quot;, indicating that there may be slight variation among different geographic populations.

====Plant preference ====

Landing appears to be mediated primarily by visual cues, of which color is the most important. &quot;P. rapae&quot; in a lab environment showed no significant preference for the shape or size of the oviposition substrate. Gravid females responded most positively to green and blue/green colors for oviposition. The preference was shown for surfaces with maximal reflectance of 550 nm. In natural conditions, oviposition was preferred on larger plants, but this was not reflected in laboratory conditions. Younger plants often had yellow/green color while older plants display a darker and stronger green. Female butterflies preferred the older plants due to the attraction to the darker green color. However, larvae perform better on younger plants.

==== Behavior on plant ====
Once a gravid female lands on a plant, tactile and contact chemical stimuli are major factors affecting acceptance or rejection of the site for egg deposition. Once a female lands on a host plant, it will go through a &quot;drumming reaction&quot; or a rapid movement of the forelegs across the surface of a leaf. This behavior is believed to provide physical and chemical information about the suitability of a plant. &quot;P. rapae&quot; is shown to prefer smooth hard surfaces similar to a surface of an index card over rougher softer textures like blotting paper or felt. &quot;P. rapae&quot; use their chemoreceptors on their tarsi to search for chemical cues from the host plant. An adult female will be sensitive to number of glucosinolates, gluconasturtiin being the most effective glucosinolate stimulants for these sensilla.

==== Egg-laying behavior ====
A gravid female adult will lay disproportionate number of eggs on peripheral or isolated plants. A single larva is less likely to exhaust the whole plant, therefore laying eggs singly prevents the likelihood of larval starvation from resource exhaustion. This behavior may have evolved to exploit the original vegetation in the eastern Mediterranean where brassica plants originated. 

Age of butterflies appears to have no effect on their ability to select the source of highest concentration of oviposition stimulant.

Additionally, it has been shown that the weather has a large impact on the eggs of &quot;P. rapae.&quot; The main issues with the weather are that strong winds can blow eggs from the leaves and strong rains can drown the caterpillars.

===Larval growth===
Larvae feeding and growth is highly dependent on their body temperature. While the larvae survives from as low as 10 °C, the growth of larvae changes with changing temperature. From 10 °C to 35 °C, growth increases, but declines rapidly at temperatures higher than 35 °C. Past 40 °C, larvae start showing substantial mortality. The diurnal variation of temperature can be extensive with daily range of more than 20 °C on some sunny days and clear nights. Larvae are able to respond well to a wide range of temperature condition, which allows them to inhabit various locations in the world. In natural conditions, larvae shows fastest growth at temperatures close to 35 °C. however, in constant temperature conditions in laboratory, larvae shows mortality at 35 °C. In this lab condition, larvae grows between 10 °C to 30.5 °C while showing maximal developmental rate at 30.5 °C. The difference between lab and natural condition is due to routine temperature changes on the scale of minutes to hours under field conditions.

==Predation==
Studies in Britain showed that birds are a major predator in British town and city environments (such as in gardens) while arthropods had larger influence in rural areas. Bird predators include the house sparrow (&quot;Passer domesticus&quot;), goldfinch (&quot;Carduelis carduelis&quot;) and skylark (&quot;Alauda arvensis&quot;). Caterpillars are cryptic, coloured as green as the host plant leaves and they rest on the undersides of the leaves, thus making them less visible to predators. Unlike the large white, they are not distasteful to predators like birds. Like many other &quot;white&quot; butterflies, they overwinter as a pupa. Bird predation is usually evident only in late-instar larvae or on overwintering pupae.

===Parasitism===

&quot;P. rapae&quot; caterpillars are commonly parasitized by a variety of insects. The four main parasitoids are braconid wasps &quot;Cotesia rubecula&quot; and &quot;Cotesia glomerata&quot;, and flies &quot;Phryxe vulgaris&quot;, and &quot;Epicampocera succinata&quot;. &quot;Cotesia rubecula&quot; and &quot;Cotesia glomerata&quot;, previously in the genus &quot;Apanteles&quot;, were introduced in North America from Asia as biocontrols. &quot;C. rubecula&quot; lays its eggs in the 1st and 2nd instar caterpillars. The larva then grows within the caterpillar and continues to feed on the caterpillar until it is almost fully grown, and at that point the caterpillar is killed. It is important to note that only one larva develops per host and the rate of &quot;C. rubecula &quot;is largely independent of &quot;P. rapae &quot;population size. &quot;C. glomerata&quot; is similar to &quot;C. rubecula&quot; in that both parasitize the host in either the 1st or 2nd instar. The main difference is that &quot;C. glomerata&quot; always kill the host in the 5th instar and multiple larvae can be raised within one host.

&quot;P. rapae&quot; pupae are frequently parasitized by &quot;Pteromalus puparum&quot;.

<text>A heckler is a person who harasses and tries to disconcert others with questions, challenges, or gibes. Hecklers are often known to shout discouraging comments at a performance or event, or to interrupt set-piece speeches, with the intent of disturbing performers or participants.

==Origin==
Although the word &quot;heckler&quot;, which originated from the textile trade, was first attested in the mid-15th century, its use as &quot;person who harasses&quot; is from 1885. To &quot;heckle&quot; was to tease or comb out flax or hemp fibres. The additional meaning, to interrupt speakers with awkward or embarrassing questions, was first used in Scotland, and specifically in early 19th century Dundee, a town where the hecklers who combed the flax had established a reputation as the most belligerent element in the workforce. In the heckling factory, one heckler would read out the day&#x27;s news while the others worked, to the accompaniment of interruptions and furious debate.

Heckling was a major part of the vaudeville theater. Sometimes it was incorporated into the play. Milton Berle&#x27;s weekly TV variety series in the 1960s featured a heckler named Sidney Spritzer (German/Yiddish for &#x27;squirter&#x27;) played by Borscht Belt comic Irving Benson. In the 1970s and 1980s, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, which was also built around a vaudeville theme, featured two hecklers, Statler and Waldorf (two old men named after famous hotels). Heckles are now particularly likely to be heard at comedy performances, to unsettle or compete with the performer.

==Politics==
Politicians speaking before live audiences have less latitude to deal with hecklers. In the early 1930s, before becoming Premier of Ontario, Mitchell Hepburn stood on top of a manure spreader, apologizing to the crowd for speaking from a Tory platform, at which someone in the crowd shouted, &quot;Well, wind &#x27;er up Mitch, she&#x27;s never carried a bigger load!&quot;

Legally, such conduct may constitute protected free speech. Strategically, coarse or belittling retorts to hecklers entail personal risk disproportionate to any gain. Some politicians, however, have been known to improvise a relevant and witty response despite these pitfalls. One acknowledged expert at this was Harold Wilson, British Prime Minister in the 1960s:

Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s 1963 &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech was largely a response to supporter Mahalia Jackson interrupting his prepared speech to shout &quot;Tell them about the dream, Martin&quot;. At that point, King stopped reading from his previously prepared speech and improvised the remainder of the speech—this improvised portion of the speech is the best-known part of the speech and frequently rated as one of the best of all time.

During a campaign stop just before winning the Presidency in 1980, Ronald Reagan was heckled by an audience member who kept interrupting him during a speech. Reagan tried to go on with his speech three times, but after being interrupted yet again glared at the heckler and snapped &quot;Aw, shut up!&quot; The audience immediately gave him a standing ovation.

In 1992, then-Presidential candidate Bill Clinton was interrupted by Bob Rafsky, a member of the AIDS activism group ACT UP, who accused him of &quot;dying of ambition to be president&quot; during a rally. After becoming visibly agitated, Clinton took the microphone off the stand, pointed to the heckler and directly responded to him by saying, &quot;[...] I have treated you and all of the other people who have interrupted my rallies with a hell of a lot more respect than you treated me. And it&#x27;s time to start thinking about that!&quot; Clinton was then met with raucous applause.

On 9 September 2009, Representative Joe Wilson (R-SC) shouted &quot;You lie!&quot; at President Barack Obama after President Obama stated that his health care plan would not subsidize coverage for undocumented noncitizens during a speech he was making to a joint session of Congress. Wilson later apologized for his outburst.

On 25 November 2013, Ju Hong, a 24-year-old South Korean immigrant without legal documentation, shouted at Obama to use his executive power to stop deportation of unauthorized noncitizens. Obama said &quot;If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so.&quot; &quot;But we&#x27;re also a nation of laws, that&#x27;s part of our tradition,&quot; he continued. &quot;And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what I&#x27;m proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal.&quot; 

=== Audience control ===
One modern political approach to discourage heckling is to ensure that major events are given before a &quot;tame&quot; audience of sympathizers, or conducted to allow restrictions on who may remain on the premises (see also, &quot;astroturfing&quot;). The downside is this may make heckling incidents even more newsworthy. This happened to Tony Blair during a photo op visit to a hospital during the 2001 general election campaign, and again in 2003 during a speech.

In 2004, American Vice President Dick Cheney was interrupted mid-speech by Perry Patterson, a middle-aged mother in a pre-screened rally audience. After various supportive outbursts that were permitted (&quot;Four more years&quot;, &quot;Go Bush!&quot;), Patterson uttered &quot;No, no, no, no&quot; and was removed from the speech area and told to leave. She refused, and was arrested for criminal trespass.

Later, in 2005, Cheney received some heckling that was broadcast during his trip to New Orleans, after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the city. The heckling occurred during a press conference in Gulfport, Mississippi, in an area that was cordoned off for public safety reasons, and then further secured for the press conference. Nevertheless, emergency room physician Ben Marble got close enough to the proceedings and could be heard yelling, &quot;Go fuck yourself, Mr. Cheney&quot;. Cheney laughed it off and continued speaking. The heckle was a reference to Cheney&#x27;s use of the phrase the previous year, when during a heated exchange with Senator Patrick Joseph Leahy, Vermont, he said &quot;fuck yourself&quot; on the floor of the senate.

On 15 October 2005, &quot;The Scotsman&quot; reported &quot;Iranian ambassador Dr Seyed Mohammed Hossein Adeli... speaking at the annual Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament conference... During his speech to the CND several people were told to leave the room following protests at Iran&#x27;s human rights record. Several protesters shouted &quot;Fascists&quot; at the ambassador and the organisers of the conference. Walter Wolfgang, the 82-year-old peace campaigner who was forced out of the Labour Party conference last month, was in the audience.&quot;

On Thursday, 20 April 2006, a heckler from the Falun Gong spiritual movement entered the US White House grounds as a reporter and interrupted a formal arrival ceremony for Chinese president Hu Jintao. Moments into Hu&#x27;s speech at the event, Wang Wenyi, perched on the top tier of the stands reserved for the press, began screaming in English and Chinese: &quot;President Bush stop him. Stop this visit. Stop the killing and torture.&quot; President Bush later apologised to his guest.

Medea Benjamin of Code Pink repeatedly interrupted a major speech by President Barack Obama regarding United States policy in the War on Terror at the National Defense University on 23 May 2013.

==Sport==
Hecklers can also appear at sporting events, and usually (but not always) direct their taunts at a visiting team. Fans of the Philadelphia Eagles American football team are notorious for heckling; among the most infamous incidents were booing and subsequently throwing snowballs at a performer dressed as Santa Claus in a halftime show in 1968, and cheering at the career-ending injury of visiting team player Michael Irvin in 1999. Often, sports heckling will also involve throwing objects onto the field; this has led most sports stadiums to ban glass containers and bottlecaps. Another famous heckler is Robert Szasz, who regularly attends Tampa Bay Rays baseball games and is known for loudly heckling one opposing player per game or series. Former Yugoslav football star Dejan Savićević was involved in an infamous incident with a heckler in which during an interview, a man on the street was heard shouting off-camera: &quot;You&#x27;re a piece of shit!&quot;. Savićević berated the man, and went on to finish the interview, without missing a beat.

In English and Scottish football, heckling and swearing from the stands, and football chants such as who ate all the pies? are common.

Australian sporting audiences are known for creative heckling. Perhaps the most famous is Yabba who had a grandstand at the Sydney Cricket Ground named after him, and now a statue.

The sport of cricket is particularly notorious for heckling between the teams themselves, which is known as sledging.

At the NBA Drafts of recent years, many fans have gone with heckling ESPN NBA analyst Stephen A. Smith. Most notably, the Stephen A. Smith Heckling Society of Gentlemen heckles him with a sock puppet dubbed as Stephen A. himself.

Tennis fans are also fairly noted for heckling. Some may call out during a service point to distract either player. Another common heckle from tennis fans is cheering after a service fault, which is considered to be rude and unsporting.

In 2009, then Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Alex Ríos was a victim of a heckling incident outside after a fund-raising event. The incident occurred after Ríos declined to sign an autograph for a young fan, the same day he went 0 for 5 with 5 strikeouts in a game against the Los Angeles Angels. An older man yelled &quot;The way you played today Alex, you should be lucky someone wants your autograph.&quot; Ríos then replied with &quot;Who gives a fuck&quot;, repeating it until being ushered into a vehicle. Ríos did apologize the next day, but was eventually placed on waivers and claimed by the Chicago White Sox later that year.

==Music==
The heckling of Bob Dylan at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in 1966 is one of the most famous examples in music history. During a quiet moment in between songs, an audience member shouts very loudly and clearly, &quot;Judas!&quot; referencing Dylan&#x27;s so-called betrayal of folk music by &quot;going electric&quot;. Dylan replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe you, you&#x27;re a liar!&quot; before telling his band to &quot;Play it fucking loud!&quot; They played an acidic version of &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;. This incident was captured on tape and the full concert was released as volume four of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Live Bootleg Series&quot;.

==Stand-up comedy==
In stand-up comedy, a heckler is what separates the medium from theatre; at any time during the show (either indirectly or directly), a heckler may interrupt a comedian&#x27;s set. Hecklers want the stand-up to break the fourth wall. Most sources claim that heckling is uncommon. Heckling is more likely to occur at open stage performances and performances where alcoholic beverages are being consumed; it is regarded as a sign of audience members becoming impatient with what they regard as a low-quality performance. New comics are often underprepared to handle hecklers properly.

In addition, live comedy venues tend to discourage heckling via signage and admissions policy, but tend to tolerate it as it creates customer loyalty. The etiquette of exactly how much heckling is tolerated differs immensely from venue to venue, however, but is generally more likely to be tolerated in blue-collar or working-class venues.

Comedians generally dislike heckling. Hecklers may rarely threaten or physically assault comedians. Even more rarely, comedians may receive death threats.

===Countering===
Comedians counter hecklers by controlling the flow of conversation. A comedian cannot completely ignore a heckler without undermining the performance. Comedians devise a strategy for quashing such outbursts, usually by having a repertoire of comebacks for hecklers—known as &quot;savers&quot;, &quot;heckler lines&quot;, &quot;squelchers&quot;, or &quot;&quot;—on hand; those who handle the moment in an off-the-cuff manner do so by giving the heckler &quot;enough rope to hang themselves&quot;. Stewart Lee treats heckles as genuine inquiries. Jerry Seinfeld is a &quot;Heckle Therapist&quot;, who verbally sympathizes with the heckler to confuse the heckler and win the audience over. Some comedians will get hecklers to repeat themselves to take away the momentum and laughter from the heckle. Phyllis Diller would have her light technician shine a spotlight on hecklers to make them feel intimidated.

Magician Teller established his persona of never speaking while performing to minimize heckling.

===Controversies===
Bill Burr&#x27;s &quot;Philadelphia Incident&quot; was performed in Camden, New Jersey, where he reprimanded an audience of over ten thousand people. Michael Richards became upset with hecklers and called them the N-word several times. When a female audience member claimed that rape jokes are never funny, Daniel Tosh allegedly made an off-the-cuff retort that it would be funny if she were to be immediately raped.

==Movies and musicals ==
Screenings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show (as well as performances of The Rocky Horror Show) are continuously heckled by the audience by use of so-called &quot;callbacks&quot; or &quot;call backs&quot;. The funny and bold comments are sometimes &#x27;traditional&#x27;, that is, developed over decades including downloadable &#x27;audience participation&#x27; heckling scripts. Many callbacks are spontaneous, regional and develop into heckling fights amongst the audience members or with either professional musical actors or audience members who perform the show in front of the screen.

==Other comedy mediums==
The comedy TV series &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; featured a pair of hecklers named Statler and Waldorf. These characters created a kind of meta-comedy act in which the show&#x27;s official comedian, Fozzie Bear, acted as their usual foil, although they occasionally made jokes at other characters as well.

Another notable use of heckling in comedy is in the cult favorite series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. The series involves a man (either Joel Robinson, Mike Nelson or Jonah Heston) and two robots (Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot) sitting in a theater mocking bad B-movies. This style of comedy, coined as riffing, is continued with commentary-based series such as RiffTrax and Cinematic Titanic.

In one of Rowan Atkinson&#x27;s plays, &quot;The School Master&quot;, a heckler interrupted his play by shouting &quot;Here!&quot; after Atkinson had read out an amusing name on his register. Atkinson incorporated it into his act by saying &quot;I have a detention book...&quot;

<doc id="630976" wikidata="Q230214" url="?curid=630976" title="Brenda Fricker">
<text>Brenda Fricker (born 17 February 1945) is an Irish actress, whose career has spanned six decades on stage and screen. She has appeared in more than 30 films and television roles. In 1990, she became the first Irish actress to win an Academy Award, earning the award for Best Supporting Actress for the biopic &quot;My Left Foot&quot; (1989). She also appeared in films such as &quot;The Field&quot; (1990), &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; (1992), &quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot; (1993), &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot; (1994), &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; (1996), &quot;Veronica Guerin&quot; (2003), &quot;Inside I&#x27;m Dancing&quot; (2004) and &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot; (2011).

In 2008, Fricker was honoured with the inaugural Maureen O&#x27;Hara Award at the Kerry Film Festival. In 2020, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; ranked her 26th on its list of the greatest Irish film actors of all time.

==Early life==
Fricker was born in Dublin, Ireland. Her mother &quot;Bina&quot; (née Murphy) was from Gneeveguilla, Co. Kerry. Bina was a teacher of languages at Stratford College in Rathgar, and her father, Desmond Frederick Fricker, served in the Department of Agriculture and as &#x27;Fred Desmond&#x27; a broadcaster with RTÉ and a journalist for &quot;The Irish Times&quot;.

Before becoming an actress, Fricker was assistant to the art editor of the &quot;Irish Times&quot;, with hopes of becoming a reporter. At age 19, she became an actress &quot;by chance&quot;. Her feature film career began with a small uncredited part in the 1964 film &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot;, based on the 1915 novel by W. Somerset Maugham. She also appeared in &quot;Tolka Row&quot;, Ireland&#x27;s first soap opera.

==Career==
One of Fricker&#x27;s first TV roles was staff nurse Maloney in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, debuting on 10 January 1977. Brenda&#x27;s character attended on the birth of Tracy Barlow on 24 January 1977&#x27;s episode. Fricker came to wider public attention in the United Kingdom in another nursing role, as Megan Roach in the BBC One television drama series &quot;Casualty&quot;. Fricker bowed out as Megan in December 1990, after playing the character in 65 episodes, because she believed her character had &quot;started off with a wonderful sense of humour, [but] lost it all and all she ever seemed to do was push a trolley around and offer tea and sympathy&quot;. In February 1998 she appeared in two episodes, with Megan attending the wedding of her former colleagues Charlie Fairhead and Barbara &#x27;Baz&#x27; Samuels. In 2007, she returned for a single episode for Red Nose Day. The episode was written by Richard Curtis. Fricker&#x27;s final appearance as Megan was in August 2010, when the character took a lethal cocktail of drugs to end her life.

Fricker found international acclaim after she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1990 for her performance as Christy Brown&#x27;s mother in &quot;My Left Foot&quot; (1989). In her acceptance speech, Brenda thanked Brown &quot;just for being alive&quot; and also dedicated the Oscar to Brown&#x27;s mother, saying &quot;anybody who gives birth 22 times deserves one of these&quot;. For her performance, Fricker was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award and she won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress as well. She rejoined &quot;My Left Foot&quot; writer and director Jim Sheridan to make the 1990 film &quot;The Field&quot;, starring alongside Richard Harris as Maggie McCabe, the wife of Harris&#x27; &quot;Bull&quot; McCabe. She continued her television work during this period, starring in the Australian-produced short series &quot;Brides of Christ&quot; (1991) and the miniseries &quot;Seekers&quot; (1992) alongside Josette Simon, produced by Sarah Lawson.

Buoyed by her Oscar win, Fricker went on to appear in several high-profile Hollywood films, most notably 1992&#x27;s &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; as the Central Park Pigeon Lady. In 1993, she portrayed May Mackenzie, the &quot;Weekly World News&quot;-obsessed Scottish mother of Mike Myers&#x27; Charlie Mackenzie, in &quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot;, and then portrayed Joseph Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s character&#x27;s motherly caretaker Maggie in the 1994 family comedy &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot;. One of her last Hollywood film roles came with &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;, as Ethel Twitty (loyal secretary to Matthew McConaughey&#x27;s Jake Brigance), after which she has focused almost exclusively on film and television work in Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. In 2003, she played Bernie Guerin, mother of Veronica Guerin (played by Cate Blanchett) in the film of the same name. She then played nurse Eileen in the film &quot;Inside I&#x27;m Dancing&quot;. In 2007, she starred in &quot;How About You&quot; the film based on a short story about people living in a residential nursing home written by Maeve Binchy, playing Heather Nightangle. Other important roles were &quot;Omagh&quot; in 2004 as police Ombudsman Nuala O&#x27; Loan, as Graiine McFadden in the TV docudrama &quot;No Tears&quot; about the women treated with the blood product Anti D in the 1970s who had been contaminated with Hepatitis C, and as Aunt Maeve in &quot;Durango&quot; in 1999, based on the novel by John B. Keane.

Fricker has appeared in &quot;Closing the Ring&quot;, Richard Attenborough&#x27;s post-World War II drama, also starring Shirley MacLaine, Christopher Plummer and Mischa Barton. In 2012, a high-profile supporting role in &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot; earned Fricker an Irish Film Award nomination, and along with Olympia Dukakis she became half of the first pair of Oscar-winning actors to play a same-sex couple in &quot;Cloudburst&quot;.

In 2021 Fricker joined the cast of the TV adaptation of &quot;Holding&quot;, based on the book of the same name by Graham Norton, marking her first major onscreen role in six years.
==Personal life==
Fricker lives in the Liberties, Dublin. She was married to Barry Davis for 15 years until they divorced in 1988 only to later rekindle their friendship in 1990. Davis died later as a result of falling down a flight of stairs under the influence of alcohol which he had battled. This loss devastated Fricker. She was pregnant six times with Davis, but all turned out in miscarriages. She said that her loves include her pet dogs, drinking Guinness, reading poetry and playing snooker (she once stated that she had taken on the whole crew of &quot;My Left Foot&quot;. &quot;I played pool against 17 of them, and beat them all,&quot; Fricker said).

In 2012, Fricker said &quot;Of all the films I’ve made, only three do I remember where I felt I’d moved forward as an actress: &quot;Cloudburst&quot;, &quot;My Left Foot&quot; and &quot;The Field&quot;.&quot;

Whilst appearing on The Tommy Tiernan Show in 2021, Fricker shared that she had battled severe depression for much of her life, including being hospitalised many times.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1989 she became the first Irish actress to win an Academy Award for her role in &quot;My Left Foot&quot;, in the Best Supporting Actress category. In 2008 Fricker was honoured with the inaugural Maureen O&#x27;Hara Award at the Kerry Film Festival. In 2020, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; ranked her 26th on its list of the greatest Irish film actors of all time.

<doc id="630977" wikidata="Q2105159" url="?curid=630977" title="Portland Head Light">
<text>Portland Head Light is a historic lighthouse in Cape Elizabeth, Maine. The light station sits on a headland at the entrance of the primary shipping channel into Portland Harbor, which is within Casco Bay in the Gulf of Maine. Completed in 1791, it is the oldest lighthouse in Maine. The light station is automated, and the tower, beacon, and foghorn are maintained by the United States Coast Guard, while the former lighthouse keeper&#x27;s house is a maritime museum within Fort Williams Park.

==History==
Construction began in 1787 at the directive of George Washington and was completed on January 10, 1791, using a fund of $1,500, established by him. Whale oil lamps were originally used for illumination. In 1855, following the formation of the Lighthouse Board, a fourth-order Fresnel lens was installed; that lens was replaced by a second-order Fresnel lens, which was replaced later by an aerobeacon in 1958. That lens was replaced with a DCB-224 aerobeacon in 1991. The DCB-224 aerobeacon is still in use.
In 1787, while Maine was still part of the state of Massachusetts, George Washington engaged two masons from the town of Falmouth (modern-day Portland), Jonathan Bryant and John Nichols, and instructed them to take charge of the construction of a lighthouse on Portland Head. Washington reminded them that the early government was poor, and said that the materials used to build the lighthouse should be taken from the fields and shores, materials which could be handled nicely when hauled by oxen on a drag. The original plans called for the tower to be 58 feet tall. When the masons completed this task, they climbed to the top of the tower and realized that it would not be visible beyond the headlands to the south, so it was raised another 20 feet.

The tower was built of rubblestone, and Washington gave the masons four years to build it. While it was under construction in 1789, the federal government was being formed, and for a while, it looked as though the lighthouse would not be finished. Following passage of their ninth law, the first congress made an appropriation and authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, to inform the mechanics that they could go on with the completion of the tower. On August 10, 1790, the second session of Congress appropriated a sum not to exceed $1500, and under the direction of the President, &quot;to cause the said lighthouse to be finished and completed accordingly.&quot; The tower was completed in 1790 and first lit on January 10, 1791.

During the American Civil War, raids on shipping in and out of Portland Harbor became commonplace, and because of the necessity for ships at sea to sight Portland Head Light as soon as possible, the tower was raised 20 more feet. The current keepers&#x27; house was built in 1891. When Halfway Rock Light was built, Portland Head Light was considered less important, and in 1883, the tower was shortened and a weaker fourth-order Fresnel lens was added. Following the mariners&#x27; complaints, the former height and second-order Fresnel lens were restored in 1885.

The station has changed little except for rebuilding the whistle house in 1975 due to its having been badly damaged in a storm. Today, Portland Head Light stands above ground and above water, its white conical tower is connected to a dwelling. The grounds and keeper&#x27;s house are owned by the town of Cape Elizabeth, while the beacon and fog signal is owned and maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard as a current aid to navigation. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Portland Head light (sic) on April 24, 1973, reference number 73000121. The lighthouse was designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2002.

==In art and popular culture==
* Edward Hopper painted the lighthouse in 1927. His watercolor resides at Boston&#x27;s Museum of Fine Arts.
* A snowy Portland Head Light was featured in the 1999 drama &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot;, which was filmed during the Ice storm of 1998.
* The lighthouse was featured in the fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons of &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;. Described as being on the shores of Lake Ontario in the show, the building housed an underground facility used by S.H.I.E.L.D. as their covert base of operations.
It was also featured on a postcard in the opening credits of&quot; National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;.

<doc id="630979" wikidata="Q3321616" url="?curid=630979" title="Mount Royal (electoral district)">
<text>Mount Royal (, ) is a federal electoral district in Quebec, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1925. Its population in 2006 was 98,888.

The riding is among the strongest Liberal ridings in the country. Réal Caouette, long-time leader of the Social Credit Party in Quebec, once said that a mailbox could win the Liberal nomination in Mount Royal and still win election just because it was red (the traditional colour of the Liberal Party). The Liberals have held the riding continuously since 1940, and have only been seriously threatened three times since then—in 1958, 1984 and 2011.

Its best-known MP is former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who represented the riding from 1965 to 1984. Its current MP, Anthony Housefather, was elected on 19 October 2015, garnering 50.3% of the vote, and was profiled as one of 10 rookie MPs to watch in the new parliament.

The riding&#x27;s English name was eliminated in the 2012 electoral redistribution but was reversed by the Riding Name Change Act, 2014.

The riding has a large Jewish population, the second-largest in Canada at 21.3 percent behind Thornhill. 

==Geography==
The district includes the City of Côte Saint-Luc, the Towns of Mount Royal and Hampstead, the neighbourhood of Snowdon and the western part of the neighbourhood of Côte-des-Neiges in the city of Montreal, Quebec.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 1924 mostly from Jacques-Cartier, Westmount—Saint-Henri and Laurier—Outremont ridings, with small parts taken from St. Antoine and St. Lawrence—St. George. The electoral district was actually abolished twice since 1924, in 1966 and in 1987; however, the district to replace it kept the same name and incumbent both times. Between the 1935 and 1949 elections, the riding did not contain any of the Town of Mount Royal, and was instead based in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and Montreal West.

This riding remained largely intact during the 2012 electoral redistribution, losing a small (uninhabited) territory to Outremont.

<doc id="630984" wikidata="Q231720" url="?curid=630984" title="Honfleur">
<text>Honfleur () is a commune in the Calvados department in northwestern France. It is located on the southern bank of the estuary of the Seine across from Le Havre and very close to the exit of the Pont de Normandie. The people that inhabit Honfleur are called &quot;Honfleurais.&quot;

It is especially known for its old port, characterized by its houses with slate-covered frontages, painted frequently by artists. There have been many notable artists, including, Gustave Courbet, Eugène Boudin, Claude Monet and Johan Jongkind. They all meet at La Ferme Saint Siméon, which is now a 5-star hotel, and create the &quot;Saint Siméon gathering&quot; contributing to the appearance of the Impressionist movement. The Sainte-Catherine church, which has a bell tower separate from the principal building, is the largest wooden church in France.

==History==


The first written record of Honfleur is a reference by Richard III, Duke of Normandy, in 1025. By the middle of the 12th century, the city represented a significant transit point for goods from Rouen to England.

Located on the estuary of one of the principal rivers of France with a safe harbour and relatively rich hinterland, Honfleur profited from its strategic position from the start of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The town&#x27;s defences were strengthened by Charles V in order to protect the estuary of the Seine from attacks by the English. This was supported by the nearby port of Harfleur. However, Honfleur was taken and occupied by the English in 1357 and from 1419 to 1450. When under French control, raiding parties often set out from the port to ransack the English coasts, including partially destroying the town of Sandwich, in Kent, England, in the 1450s.

At the end of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Honfleur benefited from the boom in maritime trade until the end of the 18th century. Trade was disturbed during the wars of religion in the 16th century. The port saw the departure of a number of explorers, in particular in 1503 of Binot Paulmierde Gonneville to the coasts of Brazil. In 1506, local man Jean Denis departed for Newfoundland island and the mouth of the Saint Lawrence. An expedition in 1608, organised by Samuel de Champlain, founded the city of Quebec in modern-day Canada.

After 1608, Honfleur thrived on trade with Canada, the West Indies, the African coasts and the Azores. As a result, the town became one of the five principal ports for the slave trade in France. During this time the rapid growth of the town saw the demolition of its fortifications on the orders of Colbert.

The wars of the French Revolution and the First Empire, and in particular the continental blockade, caused the ruin of Honfleur. It only partially recovered during the 19th century with the trading of wood from northern Europe. Trade was however limited by the silting up of the entrance to the port and development of the modern port at Le Havre. The port however still functions today.

After the Normandy landings, Honfleur was liberated together by the British army – 19th Platoon of the 12th Devon&#x27;s, 6th Air Landing Brigade, the Belgian army (Brigade Piron) on 25 August 1944 and the Canadian army without any combat.

Mentioned as &quot;Huneflet&quot; in 1025 ; &quot;Hunefloth&quot; in 1051-66 ; &quot;Hunefleth&quot; in 1082-87 ; &quot;Honneflo&quot; in 1198 ; Honnefleu in 1255 ; &quot;Honflue&quot; in 1246 ; &quot;Honeflo[u]&quot; in 1256 ; &quot;Honnefleu&quot; in 1588, up to the 16th century.

Traditional pronunciation: [ɦɔ̃&#x27;flø] or [xɔ̃&#x27;flø]/ [xɔ̃fjø] with the &quot;h&quot; strongly aspirated, like in &#x27;loch&#x27;. It is lost nowadays.

The marker &quot;-fleur&quot;, formerly &quot;-fleu&quot; which is widespread in Normandy (Cf. Barfleur, Vittefleur, Harfleur, Crémanfleur, Fiquefleur and &quot;La Gerfleur&quot; stream), which means &#x27;stream, river running into the sea&#x27;, was still in use in the 13th century as written in a document &quot;le fleu de Lestre&quot;, meaning &quot;the Lestre river&quot;.

It could come from a word of Old Norse origin &quot;flodh&quot; (i.e.&quot;flóð&quot;), compare Old English &quot;flōd&quot; (&gt; &quot;flood&quot;), which means &#x27;estuary&#x27;, &#x27;branch of the sea&#x27;, combined with &quot;flói&quot; &#x27;river running into the sea&#x27; for the meaning. But according to its numerous old mentions and those of Barfleur in &quot;-fleth&quot;, it is more probably the OE &quot;flēot&quot; &#x27;run of water&#x27;, that can be found in the English place-names in &quot;-fleet&quot;, such as Adlingfleet, Marfleet, Ousefleet, combined very often with a male&#x27;s name.

The element &quot;Hon-&quot; seems to come from an Anglo-Saxon (or Anglo-Scandinavian) given name &quot;Huna&quot; or the Norse &quot;Húni&quot;, variant form &quot;Húnn&quot;, which is also found close to Honfleur in Honnaville, homonym of the Honneville at Saint-Georges-du-Mesnil. Such a connection between two close place-names can be noted regularly in the Norman toponymy. They are, in any case, close places : Crémanfleur / Crémanville ;Barfleur (former &quot;Barbefleu&quot;) / Barbeville, etc. The &quot;-ville&quot; element is almost always combined with a personal name.

The similarity with the name of Bay of Húnaflói in Iceland is likely a coincidence.

==Geography==
Honfleur is in the Norman &quot;département&quot; of Calvados in the traditional district of pays d&#x27;Auge. It is located on the southern bank of the estuary of the Seine, across from Le Havre and very close to the exit of the Pont de Normandie (nicknamed by the locals &quot;Honfleur bridge&quot;). The town is at the eastern extremity of the coastline called the Côte Fleurie (Flowery Coast).

Like most of northern France, Honfleur has an oceanic climate with warm summers, cool winters, rain all year round and few extremes of temperature.

==Population==

The population has hovered between 7,400 and 10,000 since 1793. , Honfleur had 7,425 inhabitants, who are called &quot;Honfleurais&quot;.

==Administration==
Honfleur is the seat of a canton including the communes of Ablon, Barneville-la-Bertran, Cricquebœuf, Équemauville, Fourneville, Genneville, Gonneville-sur-Honfleur, Honfleur, Pennedepie, Quetteville, La Rivière-Saint-Sauveur, Saint-Gatien-des-Bois, and Le Theil-en-Auge.

These 13 communes also form the intercommunality of Pays de Honfleur.

In 1973 Honfleur merged with the commune of Vasouy (143 inhabitants in 1999). The INSEE code used to be 14725.

==Sights==
===Saint-Catherine&#x27;s Church===
The church is dedicated to Saint Catherine of Alexandria as evidenced by a wooden sculpture above the porch of the bell tower which separates the two naves. She is shown holding a wheel and a sword. The first nave is the oldest part of the building, dating to the second half of the 15th century, constructed right after the Hundred Years&#x27; War. It was built on the model of a market hall, using naval construction techniques, which gives the impression of an upside-down ship&#x27;s hull. Then the bell tower was built a good distance away, so that parishioners would not be burnt in case of a fire. Indeed, the bell tower did draw lightning strikes due to its height and its position on the side of a hill. In the late 15th century, a second nave was added, whose vault was like the wooden vaults of modest Gothic churches. This second part was more round, and did not look like a ship&#x27;s hull. In the 16th century, four supplementary bays were added to both naves.

The famous &quot;Axe masters&quot; of the naval yards of the city created this building without using any saws, just like their Norman ancestors (who can be seen in action in the Bayeux Tapestry), and like the Vikings before them.

The beams used to create the pillars of the nave and the side walls are of unequal length, because there were no oak trees long enough to construct them uniformly. Some beams have a footing of stones varying in height, and some have no footing.

The bays for the choir, redone in the 19th century, are of rather mediocre quality, and the roof above is higher than those of the older parts.

The church is partially covered in chestnut shingles, which are called &quot;essentes&quot; in the Norman dialect.

The neo-Norman porch was built following the model of rural Normandy churches in the 1920s, and replaced a monumental doorway in neo-classical style from the previous century (which can be seen in certain canvases by Jongkind and Boudin). The doorway itself was in Renaissance style.

The classical organ comes from the parish church of St Vincent of Rouen, and the Renaissance balcony is decorated with musicians. Stained glass from the 19th century decorates the windows of the east choir.

The building lacks a transept; statues of saints, including two local ones: Saint Marcouf et Saint Thérèse of Lisieux are the unique marks of lateral chapels. There is also a painting depicting the Martyrdom of Saint Denis of the Nativity.

===Others===
* &quot;Église Saint-Étienne &quot;(St. Stephen&#x27;s Church) is an old parish church in Gothic style, dating in part to the 14th and 15th centuries. It is the oldest church in the city. It is constructed of chalk with flint and of Caen stone, the city of Honfleur being located at the border of those two calcareous rock formations. The bell tower is covered with a façade &quot;essentage&quot; of chestnut wood. Today, it has become the Naval Museum.
* &quot;Église Saint-Léonard &quot;(St. Leonard&#x27;s Church), with a flamboyant Gothic style façade and one bay that escaped the fire set by the calvinists in 1562 ; the rest of the building was rebuilt in the 17th, which explains the unusual form of the bell tower in the region which forms a sort of a dome.
The interior is entirely painted in murals, including the visible wooden vaulting.
* Salt barns. Two barns remain out of three originals, one having been destroyed by fire. These two buildings contained of salt for preserving the catch of this important fishing port. They were constructed in the 17th century, after the citizens received permission from Colbert. The bulk of the salt came from Brouage. The walls were constructed with great blocks of chalky limestone and wooden vaulting, which, being constructed by naval carpenters, evoke the hulls of vessels of the 17th century.
* &quot;The Eugène Boudin museum&quot; main museum in Honfleur.
* The &quot;museum of Navy&quot; and the &quot;museum of Old Honfleur&quot;, two museums dedicated to the history of the city
* &quot;Chapelle de Grâce &quot;(Grace Chapel). This building was reconstructed after the cliff collapsed. On the exterior, one can see pilgrimage carillon of 24 bells.
* Le cotre &quot;Sainte-Bernadette&quot;, the last crayfishing sloop which is still in shape to sail. It belongs to the &quot;La chaloupe d&#x27;Honfleur&quot; (Honfleur Sloop) association. It was enrolled as a historic monument of France (monuments historiques) as of 18 October 1983.
* The commune was rated 4 flowers (of 4) in the Concours des villes et villages fleuris.
*&quot;La Forge&quot;. &quot;La Forge&quot; is the house of Florence Marie, who was an artist. It also contains a garden and much art. There are different types of art including paintings, sculptures, and mosaïques. Marie&#x27;s artistic eye is shown through the decorations on display at his house.

<text>Deng Ai (197 – late March 264), courtesy name Shizai, was a Chinese military general and politician of the state of Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He is best known for his pivotal role in the Wei conquest of its rival state, Shu, in late 263. He was described as a very loyal subject who made great contributions to Wei, but was also noted for his arrogance and audacity, which led to his downfall and death.

Born in a peasant family, Deng Ai started his career as a minor agricultural officer. Sometime between 235 and 239, he met Sima Yi, who recognised his talent and gave him a higher position in the civil service. Around this time, he also wrote a proposal on starting agricultural works in the Huai River region, and received credit for his ideas. Deng Ai gained greater prominence in Wei from 249 onwards after he joined the Wei general Guo Huai in stopping a Shu invasion. He also advised the regent Sima Shi on some issues. In 255, he participated in the suppression of a rebellion started by the generals Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin, and was promoted to the status of a top general. From 255 to 262, he defended Wei&#x27;s western borders in present-day Gansu from multiple incursions by the Shu forces led by the general Jiang Wei.

Deng Ai reached the pinnacle of his career in 263, when he led Wei forces to conquer Shu. By leading a strike force through a shortcut across dangerous mountainous terrain, Deng Ai showed up in the vicinity of the Shu capital, Chengdu, and took the enemy by surprise. After a failed attempt by the Shu general Zhuge Zhan to stop Deng Ai at Mianzhu, the Shu emperor Liu Shan voluntarily surrendered to Deng Ai and brought an end to the Shu state. Following his success in the Shu campaign, Deng Ai became arrogant about his achievements and showed disregard for the Wei government&#x27;s authority. The Wei general Zhong Hui exploited and manipulated Deng Ai&#x27;s arrogance to great effect. In 264, Deng Ai was arrested by Wei Guan and Zhong Hui, who were acting under order by the Wei regent Sima Zhao. He was placed in a prison cart and escorted to the capital Luoyang, but was killed en route by soldiers sent by Wei Guan. His sons were executed as well. His surviving family members were exiled but allowed to return in 266 after the Jin dynasty was established.

== Early life and career==
Deng Ai was from Jiyang County (棘陽縣), Yiyang Commandery (義陽郡), which is around present-day Xinye County, Henan. He was born towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty and lost his father at a young age. When the warlord Cao Cao conquered northern Jing Province in 208, Deng Ai moved to Runan Commandery (汝南郡; in present-day southern Henan), where he lived as a farmer and raised cattle. When he was 11 years old, he and his mother passed by Chen Shi&#x27;s tomb in Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡; around present-day Xuchang, Henan). He read two lines engraved on Chen Shi&#x27;s tombstone: &quot;his writings became examples of excellent prose; his conduct served as a role model for scholar-officials&quot; (文為世範，行為士則). He was so inspired that he wanted to change his given name to &quot;Fan&quot; (literally &quot;(role) model&quot;) and his courtesy name to &quot;Shize&quot; (literally &quot;for scholar-officials to emulate&quot;). However, since the names &quot;Fan&quot; and &quot;Shize&quot; were already used by members of his extended family, he could not change his names as such because it would violate the naming taboo.

Deng Ai later became an academician () under the Commandant of Xiangcheng (襄城; present-day Xiangcheng County, Henan). However, he was not too successful in his career because he stuttered in his speech. He then switched his job to an agricultural officer in charge of grain and fodder. The locals pitied him for his poor family background and often provided him with financial aid. Deng Ai initially did not show any form of gratitude towards them. Whenever he saw mountains and lakes, he started gesturing and pointing out how and where he believed army camps should be laid out, but was scorned by others. Later on, he was promoted to a clerical position which put him in charge of maintaining records of agricultural output.

Deng Ai had an acquaintance, Shi Bao (), who was about the same age as him. They were quite close to Guo Xuanxin (), who served as an Internuncio (). When Ji Ben, an imperial physician, started a rebellion in Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) in 218, Guo Xuanxin was implicated and initially placed under house arrest until an officer came to escort him to the imperial capital for trial. Deng Ai and Shi Bao were among the escorts. While travelling for about ten &quot;li&quot;, Guo Xuanxin chatted with them along the way and remarked that the two of them would become very capable officials in the future. Deng Ai was later promoted to the rank of an Agricultural Officer of Merit ().

Sometime between 235 and 239, he was sent as a messenger to the capital, Luoyang, where, by chance, he met Sima Yi, who was then serving as the Grand Commandant () under the Wei government. Sima Yi felt that Deng Ai was an extraordinary person so he recruited him and promoted him to the position of a Gentleman of Writing ().

== Agricultural and irrigation projects ==
Around the time, the Wei state was planning to promote agriculture and stockpile food resources in preparation for military campaigns against its rival states, Shu and Wu. Deng Ai was sent to survey the lands from the east of Chen () and Xiang () commanderies (around present-day Zhoukou, Henan) to Shouchun (壽春; around present-day Shou County, Anhui), and assess their suitability for agriculture. He saw that the lands were fertile but lacked moisture, so they were not fully utilised. He suggested digging irrigation channels to irrigate the land, and open up new canals for transporting goods by water.

Deng Ai wrote a proposal, the &quot;Ji He Lun&quot; (濟河論; &quot;Discussion on the River&quot;), to explain his ideas: Sima Yi agreed with Deng Ai&#x27;s proposal and implemented his ideas.

In 241, the agricultural projects were complete. Whenever there were battles in the southeast between Wei and Wu, the Wei forces could sail down the river towards the Huai River region to counter the enemy. This was because they had plenty of food supplies stockpiled upstream and had the water pathways to their advantage. Deng Ai received credit for his proposal.

== Battle of Tao River ==
Deng Ai later became a military adviser to the Wei general Xiahou Xuan and served as the Administrator of Nan&#x27;an Commandery (南安郡; around present-day Longxi and Wushan counties, Gansu). In 249, he followed Xiahou Xuan&#x27;s successor Guo Huai to resist an invasion led by the Shu general Jiang Wei. After the Shu forces were repelled, Guo Huai advanced west to attack the Qiang tribes. Deng Ai cautioned him: &quot;The enemy did not retreat far. They might turn back to attack us again, so we should split up our forces in case they attack us again.&quot;

Guo Huai then ordered Chen Tai, Xu Zhi and Deng Ai to lead Wei forces to attack the fortresses at Qushan and cut off their food and water supplies. Ju An and Li Xin led their men to taunt Deng Ai to attack them, but Deng Ai ignored them. As time passed, the two fortresses gradually ran out of supplies. Jiang Wei led his troops from Mount Niutou (牛頭山; west of present-day Zhaohua District, Guangyuan, Sichuan) to reinforce the fortresses. They encountered Chen Tai and his troops along the way. Chen Tai said: &quot;&quot;The Art of War&quot; says that the best way to win a battle is to win without fighting. If we manage to occupy Mount Niutou, Jiang Wei&#x27;s return route will be sealed off and he can be easily captured by us.&quot; He then ordered his troops to build forts to resist Jiang Wei&#x27;s forces but refrain from engaging the enemy. At the same time, he also wrote to Guo Huai and requested his help in attacking Mount Niutou. Guo Huai did so and led his troops across the Tao River in preparation for attacking Mount Niutou.

Deng Ai remained behind and garrisoned at the north of Baishui County. Three days later, Jiang Wei sent Liao Hua to lead a force to approach Deng Ai&#x27;s camp from the south of Baishui. Deng Ai told his officers: &quot;Jiang Wei has turned back to attack us. We have few troops. Ideally, we should cross the river and not build a bridge. I believe Jiang Wei must have sent Liao Hua to hinder us so that we are forced to remain here, while he would attack Taocheng (洮城) from the east.&quot; Taocheng was located north of the river and was about 60 &quot;li&quot; away from Deng Ai&#x27;s position. Deng Ai immediately dispatched troops to travel overnight to Taocheng to defend the fortress. As he expected, Jiang Wei crossed the river to attack Taocheng, but failed to capture the fortress because Deng Ai had already strengthened its defences. For his achievements, Deng Ai was enfeoffed as a Secondary Marquis (), awarded the rank of General Who Attacks Rebels (), and subsequently appointed as the Administrator of Chengyang Commandery (城陽郡; around present-day Zhucheng, Shandong).

== Military advisor service ==
Around the time, the Xiongnu prince Liu Bao, who was nominally a vassal under the Wei government, unified the Five Divisions of Xiongnu in Bing province and was building up his military force. Deng Ai wrote a memorial to the Wei imperial court: 
Deng Ai also suggested: &quot;We should gradually segregate those Han Chinese living with barbarians, inculcate moral values such as integrity in them, so as to prevent them from resorting to unlawful actions.&quot; Sima Shi, the General-in-Chief () who had recently taken over the reins of power as the regent of Wei, accepted Deng Ai&#x27;s suggestions. He also appointed Deng Ai as the Administrator of Runan Commandery (汝南郡; in present-day southern Henan), where Deng lived in his younger days. Upon arriving in Runan to take office, Deng Ai sought a man who generously helped his father before because he wanted to repay that man for his kindness. However, he was disappointed to learn that the man had already died, so he sent his subordinates to pay respects at the man&#x27;s tomb on his behalf. He also gave many gifts to the man&#x27;s mother and recruited the man&#x27;s son to be an accounting officer under him. During his tenure, Deng Ai developed wastelands in Runan and ensured that his soldiers and the common people had their basic needs fulfilled.

When the Wu regent Zhuge Ke retreated after a failed attempt to capture the Wei-controlled fortress at Hefei, Deng Ai approached the Wei regent Sima Shi and said: As Deng Ai foresaw, Zhuge Ke was ousted from power not long after he returned to Wu and was killed along with his family.

Deng Ai was appointed as the Inspector of Yan Province () and promoted to General Who Inspires Might (). He wrote a memorial to the Wei imperial court: 

== Suppression of Second Shouchun rebellion ==
Deng Ai was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Fangcheng Village () after Cao Mao became the new Wei emperor in 254. In the following year, when the Wei generals Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin started a rebellion in Shouchun (壽春; around present-day Shou County, Anhui), they sent messengers to other areas to incite the people to join their rebellion. Deng Ai arrested and executed the messengers, and then led troops to suppress the rebellion. His force occupied Yuejia (樂嘉; present-day Xiangcheng, Henan) and started building pontoon bridges. When the main Wei army led by Sima Shi showed up, Deng Ai rendezvoused with him and they advanced towards Shouchun together. The rebels were subsequently defeated. Deng Ai pursued the fleeing Wen Qin to Qiutou (丘頭; southeast of present-day Shenqiu County, Henan), but Wen Qin still managed to escape and defect to Wei&#x27;s rival state, Wu.

The Wu general Sun Jun led thousands of troops and crossed the Yangtze to support the rebels. The Wei general Zhuge Dan ordered Deng Ai to resist the enemy at Feiyang (), but Deng saw that if he was stationed in Feiyang he would be in a disadvantageous position, so he relocated his troops to a neighbouring village. He then sent Zhuge Xu to attack the remaining rebels and Wu forces at Lijiang Village (黎漿亭; southeast of present-day Shou County, Anhui), where they defeated the enemy.

In the same year, Deng Ai was promoted to Colonel of Changshui (). Later on, for his contributions in suppressing the rebellion, he was further promoted to acting General Who Stabilises the West () and his marquis rank was increased by one grade to Marquis of Fangcheng District ().

== Defending Wei territory ==
Around 255, the Shu general Jiang Wei led forces to attack Wei and besieged Wang Jing, the Inspector of Yong Province, in Didao (狄道; southwest of present-day Lintao County, Gansu). The Wei imperial court appointed Deng Ai as General Who Stabilises the West () and Colonel Who Protects the Eastern Qiang () to lead troops to lift the siege. By then, Jiang Wei had withdrawn to Zhongti (鍾提; south of present-day Lintao County, Gansu), so many of Deng Ai&#x27;s subordinates thought that Jiang Wei was exhausted and would not attack Didao again. However, Deng Ai held a different opinion and he said: As Deng Ai predicted, Jiang Wei led his forces to attack Mount Qi later but were repelled by the defences set up by Deng. Jiang Wei retreated to Dong Village (董亭; south of present-day Wushan County, Gansu), while Deng Ai stationed his troops at Mount Wucheng (). Jiang Wei tried to seize control of the mountainous terrain from Deng Ai, but was driven back. That night, Jiang Wei attempted to cross the Wei River to attack Shanggui (上邽; present-day Tianshui, Gansu). Deng Ai intercepted Jiang Wei at Duan Valley (段谷; southwest of present-day Tianshui, Gansu) and defeated him.

In 256, the Wei imperial court issued an edict as follows: 

In the following year, Jiang Wei advanced to the Mang river in his attempt to attack the position of Deng Ai and Sima Wang. However, both Wei generals refused to engage and held their position.

Deng Ai defeated Jiang Wei in battle again along the Great Wall and forced him to retreat back to Shu. He was further promoted to General Who Attacks the West (), and had the number of taxable households in his marquisate increased to 6,600. 

In 262, he defeated Jiang Wei in battle at Houhe (). Jiang Wei retreated to Tazhong (沓中; northwest of present-day Zhugqu County, Gansu) and garrisoned there.

== Conquest of Shu ==
===Strategic planning and opening moves===
In the autumn of 263, the Wei imperial government started mobilising troops in preparation for a campaign against Shu. Sima Zhao, who oversaw the campaign, ordered Deng Ai to lead 30,000 troops to Tazhong (沓中; northwest of present-day Zhugqu County, Gansu) to harass Jiang Wei and keep him occupied, while Zhuge Xu, the Inspector of Yong Province, would lead forces to block Jiang Wei&#x27;s retreat route back to Shu. Before Deng Ai embarked on the campaign against Shu, he dreamt of himself sitting on a mountaintop with water flowing near him. He asked an official, Yuan Shao (), who was well-versed in the &quot;Yijing&quot;, to explain to him what his dream meant. Yuan Shao told him that he would successfully conquer Shu, but would not return to Wei. Deng Ai felt gloomy after hearing this.

Deng Ai sent Wang Qi () to lead troops attack Jiang Wei&#x27;s camp directly, with Qian Hong leading another force to clear the path, and Yang Xin () to attack the enemy positions at Gansong (甘松; around present-day Songpan County, Sichuan).

When Jiang Wei received news that another Wei army led by Zhong Hui had occupied Hanzhong Commandery, he led his troops from Tazhong back further into Shu territory, but was pursued by Yang Xin to Qiangchuankou (彊川口; the intersection of the Bailong and Jialing rivers), where he was defeated. Jiang Wei learnt that Zhuge Xu had blocked his retreat route at the bridge of Yinping, so he led his men through Konghan Valley (孔函谷; south of present-day Xigu District, Lanzhou, Gansu) to the northern road in an attempt to bypass Zhuge Xu&#x27;s position. When Zhuge Xu heard about it, he retreated back by 30 &quot;li&quot;. By then, Jiang Wei and his troops had travelled about 30 &quot;li&quot; on the northern road when they heard that Zhuge Xu had lifted the blockade at the bridge. Jiang Wei ordered his troops to quickly turn back and cross the bridge. Zhuge Xu tried to turn back to block Jiang Wei again but arrived at the bridge one day too late. After crossing the bridge, Jiang Wei moved to the mountain pass of Jiange and garrisoned there. Zhong Hui attacked Jiang Wei at Jiange several times but was unable to breach the defences.

=== Capture of the Shu capital ===
Deng Ai proposed: 

Zhong Hui approved Deng Ai&#x27;s idea and even ordered his subordinate Tian Zhang () to join Deng Ai on the expedition. Some time between 18 November and 17 December 263, Deng Ai led a strike force from Yinping through the shortcut, bypassing the west of Jiange and heading straight towards Jiangyou. The shortcut covered a distance of more than 700 &quot;li&quot; and cut across mountainous terrain. Deng Ai and his men had to construct several bridges along the way. The mountains were high and the valleys were deep, which made the journey extremely dangerous. After some time, they were completely cut off from their supply train. Deng Ai wrapped himself in a large piece of felt and rolled down the mountain. His men climbed trees and scaled cliffs in single file. Along the way, they encountered three groups of Shu ambushers, defeated them and destroyed their camps. Deng Ai let Tian Zhang lead the vanguard and clear the path. Deng Ai and his vanguard showed up at Jiangyou. Ma Miao (), the Shu-appointed administrator of Jiangyou, gave up resistance and surrendered to Deng Ai.

The Shu general Zhuge Zhan led an army from Fu County to Mianzhu, where they engaged Deng Ai and his troops in battle. Deng Ai ordered his son Deng Zhong () to flank the enemy from the right, and Shi Zuan () to flank the enemy from the left. Both Deng Zhong and Shi Zuan were driven back by Zhuge Zhan, and they told Deng Ai: &quot;The enemy cannot be defeated.&quot;. Deng Ai sternly replied: &quot;This battle will determine whether we live or die. What do you mean when you say the enemy cannot be defeated?&quot; He wanted to execute them, but they turned back and hastily readied their troops for battle again. They defeated the Shu forces and killed the enemy officers Zhuge Zhan, Zhuge Shang and Zhang Zun.

Deng Ai and his men then pressed on further to Luo County (雒縣; north of present-day Guanghan, Sichuan). Liu Shan, the Shu emperor, sent an emissary to present his imperial seal to Deng Ai and indicate his wish to surrender.

===Managing post-war Shu===
When Deng Ai arrived in Chengdu, Liu Shan tied himself up and led an entourage of over 60 people to officially surrender. Deng Ai freed Liu Shan from his bonds and treated him kindly. He also forbid his soldiers from plundering and pillaging the city, and ordered that daily activities in the city resume as per normal. Many former Shu officials were so impressed with Deng Ai that they willingly submitted to him; the people of Shu also praised Deng Ai for his kindness. Deng Ai used his acting imperial authority granted by the Wei government to appoint Liu Shan as acting General of Chariots of Cavalry () and grant titles to many former Shu nobles and officials; some of them became his subordinates. Deng Ai also appointed Shi Zuan as the Inspector of Yi Province and put Qian Hong in charge of overseeing the former Shu commanderies. A memorial was constructed at Mianzhu to glorify Deng Ai&#x27;s victory over Zhuge Zhan, and the fallen Wei soldiers were buried alongside their Shu counterparts.

Deng Ai became arrogant about his achievements in conquering Shu. He once bragged to the former Shu officials: &quot;All of you are lucky to have encountered me, which is why you are where you are today. If you encountered someone like Wu Han, you would have been destroyed.&quot; He also said: &quot;Jiang Wei is a short-lived hero. He pales in comparison with me.&quot; Some people scorned him for his boastfulness.

On 8 February 264, the Wei imperial court issued an edict praising Deng Ai for his successful conquest of Shu and comparing him to famous generals such as Bai Qi, Han Xin, Wu Han and Zhou Yafu. Deng Ai was promoted to the position of Grand Commandant () in the imperial court and had the number of taxable households in his marquisate increased by 20,000. His two sons were made village marquises () and given 1,000 taxable households each in their marquisates.
== Downfall and death ==
===Correspondence between Deng Ai and Sima Zhao===
Deng Ai wrote to Sima Zhao, suggesting that they let the weary troops rest and recuperate while concurrently making preparations for a future campaign against Wei&#x27;s other rival state, Wu. He also proposed that Liu Shan be treated generously by making him a prince and showering him with luxuries. The purpose of doing so was to induce and tempt Sun Xiu, the Wu emperor, into voluntarily surrendering to Wei. He wrote: 

Sima Zhao sent Wei Guan to reply Deng Ai that his proposal would be submitted to the Wei imperial court for further deliberation before it could be implemented. Deng Ai grew impatient and argued that they would be wasting time if they had to wait for further instructions from the imperial court before taking action. He quoted lines from the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot; and &quot;The Art of War&quot; to hint that he was justified in ignoring standard protocol and acting autocratically as long as what he did was to Wei&#x27;s benefit. He wrote: 

===Zhong Hui&#x27;s role in Deng Ai&#x27;s arrest===

Zhong Hui, Hu Lie (), Shi Zuan () and others accused Deng Ai of showing disrespect for the Wei imperial court&#x27;s authority, and claimed that he was likely to start a rebellion. The &quot;Shiyu&quot; mentioned that Zhong Hui was skilled in imitating people&#x27;s handwriting. After getting his hands on a letter written by Deng Ai to Sima Zhao, he edited it to make it sound arrogant and demanding. At the same time, he also destroyed a letter from Sima Zhao to Deng Ai to increase Sima&#x27;s suspicions towards Deng.

Sometime in late February or early March 264, the Wei imperial court then issued an edict ordering Deng Ai to be arrested and transported back to the capital, Luoyang. Wei Guan and Zhong Hui went to Deng Ai&#x27;s camp, where they used Sima Zhao&#x27;s letter to order Deng Ai&#x27;s men to put down their weapons. Deng Ai was arrested and placed in a prison cart for his journey to Luoyang. When he was arrested, Deng Ai exclaimed: &quot;I am a loyal subject, yet I meet with such a fate! Whatever that happened to Bai Qi in the past has just happened to me in the present.&quot;

===Death===
After Deng Ai was escorted away, Zhong Hui started a rebellion against Wei in Chengdu on 1 March 264, but the rebellion failed when some Wei officers, who were unwilling to participate, mutinied against Zhong Hui and killed him on 3 March 264. After Zhong Hui&#x27;s death, Deng Ai&#x27;s subordinates caught up with the convoy escorting their general, freed him, and brought him back to Chengdu. When Wei Guan heard about it, he ordered Tian Xu to lead troops to attack Deng Ai.

Tian Xu had initially served under Deng Ai during the campaign against Shu. During an earlier battle at Jiangyou, Deng Ai wanted to execute Tian Xu for delaying his advance against the enemy, but spared him eventually. When Wei Guan sent Tian Xu to attack Deng Ai, he told Tian, &quot;You can now take revenge against Deng Ai for how he humiliated you at Jiangyou.&quot;

Tian Xu and his soldiers intercepted Deng Ai at the west of Mianzhu and killed him along with his son, Deng Zhong (), and Shi Zuan. After Deng Ai&#x27;s death, his other son(s) in Luoyang was/were also rounded up and executed, while his surviving family members were exiled to the Western Regions.

When the Wei general Du Yu heard about what Wei Guan told Tian Xu, he remarked that Wei Guan, as a man of high social status, should not behave in such a petty and spiteful manner. When Wei Guan heard about Du Yu&#x27;s remarks, he immediately went to meet Du Yu to thank him.

==Posthumous rehabilitation ==
In 266, after the Jin dynasty replaced the Wei regime in February, Sima Yan (Emperor Wu) issued an imperial edict to pardon Deng Ai&#x27;s descendants and allow them to return from exile. He noted that Deng Ai was fairly punished for his arrogance and audacity, but the &quot;redeeming&quot; factor was that Deng Ai did not resist arrest and willingly resigned to his fate.

When Deng Ai was stationed in Yong and Liang provinces, he strengthened the parapets in the area and had some forts constructed for defensive purposes. During the mid-Taishi era (265–274) in Emperor Wu&#x27;s reign, the Qiang tribes in Yong Province rebelled against Jin rule and killed the Inspector of Liang Province. The surviving officials and local residents found safety in the forts built by Deng Ai about a decade earlier.

== Legacy ==
=== Family and descendants ===
Deng Ai had at least two sons. Two of his sons – one of whom was Deng Zhong () – held village marquis titles and owned marquisates of 1,000 taxable households. Deng Zhong was killed along with his father. Deng Ai&#x27;s other sons who were in Luoyang were arrested and executed in the aftermath of their father&#x27;s death. Deng Ai&#x27;s surviving family members were exiled and allowed to return only in 266 after Emperor Wu of the Jin dynasty issued an imperial edict pardoning them.

In 273, Emperor Wu appointed Deng Ai&#x27;s grandson, Deng Lang (), as a &quot;langzhong&quot; (). Deng Lang served as the Prefect of Danshui County (丹水縣; around present-day Xichuan County, Henan) and then as the Prefect of Dingling County (定陵縣; around present-day Qingyang County, Anhui). He had at least one son, Deng Tao (). During the Yongjia era (307–313) in the reign of Emperor Huai, Deng Lang was appointed as the Administrator of Xindu Commandery (新都郡; around present-day Guanghan, Sichuan). However, before he left to assume office, he died in a fire in Xiangyang Commandery along with his mother, wife and children. Only his grandson Deng Xing (), Deng Tao&#x27;s son, survived the fire.

Deng Qianqiu (), another grandson of Deng Ai, was recruited to serve under Wang Rong, a prominent Jin dynasty official. He died before Deng Lang while his two sons also perished in the Xiangyang fire.

=== Appraisal ===
Chen Shou (233–297), who wrote Deng Ai&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, commented on Deng Ai as follows: &quot;Deng Ai was upright and strong. He achieved many successes, but failed to protect himself from hidden pitfalls and dangers, which resulted in his eventual downfall. He could envision what would happen to Zhuge Ke, yet ironically could not foresee his own fate. This was probably what the ancients called &#x27;lack of self-awareness and narrow-mindedness&#x27;.&quot;

In 267, Duan Zhuo () wrote a memorial to Emperor Wu of the Jin dynasty to speak up for Deng Ai. In the memorial, Duan Zhuo discussed Deng Ai&#x27;s contributions to Wei and argued that Deng had no intention of rebelling against Wei, citing Deng&#x27;s advanced age (Deng was nearing 70 at the time of his death) as one reason. He also mentioned that Deng Ai had been deeply misunderstood because of his boorish and uncouth behaviour, which made him likely to offend people easily. Duan Zhuo also compared Deng Ai to Bai Qi and Wu Zixu, two generals in the Spring and Autumn period who made great contributions to their respective states but were forced to commit suicide.

During the mid-Xianning era (275–280) in Emperor Wu&#x27;s reign, Fan Zhen (), a general who previously served under Deng Ai during the Wei campaign against Shu, had an audience with the emperor. When Emperor Wu asked about Deng Ai, Fan Zhen became very emotional and he recalled that Deng Ai was a very loyal subject of Wei.

=== In popular culture ===
Deng Ai is first introduced as a playable character in the seventh instalment of Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; video game series. In the games, he is anachronistically associated with the Jin dynasty faction; historically, he died one year before the Jin dynasty was established.

<text>Sima Zhao () (; 211 – 6 September 265), courtesy name Zishang (子上), was a Chinese military general, politician, and regent of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. 

Sima Zhao capably maintained control of Wei, which had been seized by his father Sima Yi and previously maintained by his older brother Sima Shi, successfully crushing all internal opposition in the form of dissent and rebellion. In 263, despite opposition, he decided to take advantage of the present weakness in Shu Han to the west and launched an invasion against it, which eventually managed to convince its emperor, Liu Shan, towards formally surrendering, tipping the decades-long established balance of power decisively in Wei&#x27;s favor. Towards the end of the campaign, he had himself created the Duke of Jin and accepted the Nine bestowments—a step that put him closer to usurpation of the throne—although he never actually ascended the throne, having further styled himself the King of Jin in 264, and then died in 265. His military credit and successful grip on the political scene helped to set up the plot of overthrowing Wei by his son, Sima Yan, who usurped the Wei throne and proclaimed the Jin dynasty with himself as its emperor in 266. After the establishment of Jin, Sima Yan posthumously honoured his father as Emperor Wen of Jin (晉文帝), with the temple name of Taizu (太祖).

A Chinese idiom involving and inspired by Sima Zhao states that &quot;Everyone on the street knows what&#x27;s in Sima Zhao&#x27;s mind&quot; (司馬昭之心, 路人皆知), meaning that a person&#x27;s supposed hidden intention (in this case, usurping the throne) is so well known that it is not really hidden. It came from a quotation by Cao Mao, fourth emperor of Wei, who launched an unsuccessful uprising against Sima Zhao in an attempt to take back imperial power.

==Early life==
Sima Zhao was born in 211, as the second-born son of Sima Yi and his wife Zhang Chunhua, younger only to Sima Shi. As his father was an important Wei official, Sima Zhao himself climbed up the ranks of officials fairly rapidly. Due to his father&#x27;s achievements in destroying the warlord Gongsun Yuan, he was created a Marquess of Xincheng in 238 towards the end of the year. Around 240, he was made the General of the Gentlemen of the Agriculture Colonies (典農中郎將). A year later, around 241, he was appointed as Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary (散騎常侍). In March 244, he partook in Cao Shuang&#x27;s disastrous campaign against Shu, where he managed to drive off a night-raid on his camp led by Shu forces. Despite the ultimate failure of the campaign, he was promoted to the rank of Consultant Gentleman (a position typically regarded as a placeholder, in which he himself was kept for over five years, which was likely bestowed upon him by Cao Shuang and his group so that he would be kept from further political advancement).

==Career up to 255==
===Incident at Gaoping Tombs===

Sima Zhao&#x27;s involvement in his father&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état against the regent Cao Shuang in 249 is unclear. According to the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;, he was not told about the plan, hatched by his father and his older brother, until the last minute—a view disagreed with by other historians, who assert that he was intimately involved in the planning. Regardless, in the aftermath of the successful coup his father became the paramount political authority in Wei, and he himself received an addition of 1,000 households to his fief and became important in status. In 251, when his father suppressed the failed rebellion of Wang Ling, Sima Zhao served as deputy commander, and was rewarded with the addition of 300 households to his fief and a Marquis post for his young son, Sima You. During the next few years, he was involved in commanding forces in repelling invasions by Shu&#x27;s commander of the armed forces, Jiang Wei.

===Battle of Dongxing===

In 253, Wei forces headed by Sima Zhao marched east to confront Wu, who had been overstepping their boundaries by building upon a lake and arming it with men on land which belonged to Wei. The Wei officers, feeling secure in their position and with their superior numbers, grew arrogant and allowed themselves to become drunk, and so were quickly overwhelmed by the Wu forces led by Ding Feng and Lü Ju, forcing the Wei forces to flee and retreat. After the loss at the Battle of Dongxing, Sima Zhao asked his Marshal Wang Yi in private who was responsible for the failure of the battle, to which Wang Yi responded: &quot;Responsibility lies with the army commander.&quot; Sima Zhao retorted: &quot;The Marshal means to make me shoulder the blame?&quot; Thereafter he had Wang Yi executed. Sima Shi, the Wei regent and Sima Zhao&#x27;s older brother, received memorials from ministers asking that Wang Chang, Guanqiu Jian, Hu Zun, and all the others who were a part of the campaign to be demoted for their failure, however, Sima Shi stated that: &quot;It is because I did not listen to Gongxiu [Zhuge Dan] that we have come to this plight. In this I am culpable; how can the generals be at fault?&quot; He therefore promoted the generals who partook in the battle, while demoting Sima Zhao by removing his enfeoffment.

===Succeeding Sima Shi===
In 254, while Sima Zhao was at the capital Luoyang, advisors to the Wei emperor, Cao Fang, suggested that the emperor surprise Sima Zhao and kill him to seize his troops, and then use those troops against Sima Shi. Cao Fang, apprehensive, did not act on the suggestion, but the plot was still discovered, and Sima Zhao assisted his brother in deposing the emperor and replacing him with Cao Mao. In the aftermath of the removal of the emperor, the generals Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin rebelled in 255 but were defeated by Sima Shi.

Sima Shi, however, had a serious eye illness that was aggravated by the campaign, and he died less than a month later; on 23 March. At that time, Sima Zhao was with his brother at Xuchang. The 14-year-old emperor Cao Mao made an effort to regain imperial power. He issued an edict which, under the rationale that Sima Shi had just quelled Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin&#x27;s rebellion and that the southeastern empire was still not completely pacified, ordered Sima Zhao to remain at Xuchang and that Sima Shi&#x27;s assistant Fu Jia return to Luoyang with the main troops. Under Fu Jia and Zhong Hui&#x27;s advice, however, Sima Zhao returned to Luoyang anyway against edict, and was able to maintain control of the government. Indeed, from that point on, he did not let Cao Mao or Empress Dowager Guo out of his control.

==As paramount authority==
===Consolidation of authority===
====Third Rebellion of Shouchun====
During the next few years, Sima Zhao consolidated his authority further, leaving the emperor and empress dowager with little power. He further built up a series of events that were viewed as precipitations to usurpation of the Wei throne. In 256, he had the emperor grant him the privilege of wearing imperial robes, crowns, and boots. He further tested waters by having his close aides hinting to the generals around the empire as to his intentions. In 257, when he sent Jia Chong to probe Zhuge Dan&#x27;s intentions, Zhuge rebuked Jia Chong severely
—leading Sima Zhao to summon Zhuge Dan back to the capital under the guise of a promotion. Zhuge Dan refused and started a rebellion, submitting himself to Eastern Wu for protection. Sima Zhao advanced quickly on Zhuge Dan&#x27;s stronghold of Shouchun and surrounded it, eventually capturing the city in 258 after cutting off any hope of an Eastern Wu rescue, killing Zhuge Dan and his family, although he treated many of those involved, such as the common citizens, and most notably the Wu soldiers who had been sent as reinforcements, with great magnanimity, despite being advised to punish the citizens and kill all the soldiers, to which he retorted: &quot;The ancients in using troops, preserving the state is best, so kill the leaders and nothing more. Should the Wú soldiers escape and flee back, then they can report the greatness of the central states.&quot; This benevolence managed to cast the Sima family in a more, and much-needed, positive light amongst the populace. After Zhuge Dan&#x27;s death, there was no one who dared to oppose Sima Zhao further for the next few years. In 258, he would force the emperor to offer him the Nine Bestowments, state chancellorship, and the title of Duke of Jin—a step that put him closer to usurpation—and then publicly declined them nine times.

====Death of Cao Mao and complete control of the Wei government====
In May 260, Sima Zhao again forced Cao Mao to issue an edict granting him the Nine Bestowments and the promotions, which he then declined again, but which drew Cao Mao&#x27;s ire. He gathered his associates Wang Shen, Wang Jing, and Wang Ye and told them that, while he knew the chances of success were slight, he was going to act against Sima Zhao. He took lead of the imperial guards, armed himself with a sword, and set out toward Sima Zhao&#x27;s mansion. Sima Zhao&#x27;s brother Sima Zhou tried to resist, but after Cao Mao&#x27;s attendants yelled loudly, Sima Zhou&#x27;s forces deserted. Jia Chong then arrived and intercepted the imperial guards. Cao Mao fought personally, and Jia Chong&#x27;s troops, not daring to attack the emperor, were also deserting. One of the officers under Jia Chong&#x27;s command, Cheng Ji (成濟), after asking Jia what to do and was told by Jia to defend the Sima power regardless of the consequences, took a spear and killed Cao Mao with it. This left Sima Zhao thoroughly vexed.

After Cao Mao&#x27;s death, public sentiments called for Jia Chong&#x27;s death, but what Sima Zhao did first was to force Empress Dowager Guo to posthumously demote Cao Mao to common citizen status and order that he be buried as such. He also executed Wang Jing and his family. The next day, after pleas from his uncle Sima Fu, Sima Zhao instead had Empress Dowager Guo order that Cao Mao be promoted back to a duke and buried with the ceremonies of an imperial prince. Sima Zhao then summoned Cao Huan, the Duke of Changdao, and a grandson of Cao Cao, to the capital to become the emperor; by now, Empress Dowager Guo was powerless to speak further. In the midst of these events, Sima Zhao went on to decline the Nine Bestowments and the promotions towards state chancellorship and the title of Duke of Jin. Some days later, Sima Zhao publicly accused Cheng Ji and his brothers of treason and had them and their family executed to appease public sentiment while sparing Jia Chong. No one dared to act against Sima Zhao even in the aftermaths of the emperor&#x27;s death, however, for Sima Zhao was effectively the imperial authority by this point. On 27 June, Cao Huan entered Luoyang and became emperor. Two days later, Sima Zhao forced Cao Huan to confer upon him the Nine Bestowments as well as the promotions towards state chancellorship and the title of Duke of Jin, which he earnestly declined, as well as another time in October.

===Conquest of Shu===
In 262, aggravated by Jiang Wei&#x27;s incessant border attacks, Sima Zhao considered hiring assassins to murder Jiang Wei, but this plan was opposed by his advisor, Xun Xu. Zhong Hui himself believed that Jiang Wei had worn out his troops and that it would be an appropriate time to try to destroy Shu once and for all. Sima Zhao put Zhong Hui, Zhuge Xu, and Deng Ai in charge of the invasion forces (even though the latter initially opposed the campaign), and they set out in autumn 263.

Zhong Hui, Zhuge Xu, and Deng Ai faced little opposition from Shu&#x27;s forces, whose strategy was to draw the Wei forces in and then close on them—a strategy that backfired, as the Wei forces, much quicker than expected, leapt past Shu border cities and immediately onto the important Yang&#x27;an Pass (陽安關; in present-day Hanzhong, Shaanxi), capturing it. Zhuge Xu was eventually expelled and sent back as a prisoner, though, as Deng Ai wanted to merge his own troops with Zhuge Xu&#x27;s, whereas Zhuge Xu did not deviate from the original plan; he met up with Zhong Hui, who wanted to monopolize on the military situation, and so sent an edict mentioning the cowardice of Zhuge Xu, after which the latter&#x27;s troops were merged with Zhong Hui&#x27;s. Jiang Wei was able to regroup and block off the Wei forces from further advances, until Deng Ai led his troops over a treacherous mountain pass, descending on Jiangyou, defeating Zhuge Zhan and heading directly for the Shu capital, Chengdu. Surprised by Deng Ai&#x27;s quick advances and believing that Jiang Wei would be unable to return fast enough to defend the capital against Deng Ai, the Shu emperor, Liu Shan, surrendered to Wei. Earlier this year, in the spring of 263, Sima Zhao had again declined the Nine Bestowments and the promotions, but during the campaign, in light of the recent successes, on 9 December 263, the emperor, Cao Huan, bestowed upon Sima Zhao the title of the Duke of Jin, the Nine Bestowments, and the position of Chancellor of the State, which Sima Zhao finally accepted.

===Zhong Hui&#x27;s Rebellion===

Another turmoil quickly came after Shu&#x27;s destruction, however. Deng Ai, proud of his achievements, became arrogant in his correspondence with Sima Zhao, drawing Sima Zhao&#x27;s suspicion. Zhong Hui, who had plans to rebel himself, quickly forged letters that further damaged the relations between Sima Zhao and Deng Ai beyond repair, and Sima Zhao ordered Zhong Hui to arrest Deng Ai, although he himself, wary of Zhong Hui, nevertheless arrived with his own forces and stationed at Chang&#x27;an. Zhong Hui did so, seizing Deng Ai&#x27;s troops and merging them with his own, and then, with Jiang Wei as his assistant (but with Jiang Wei&#x27;s actual intentions being to eventually kill Zhong Hui and restore Shu), declared a rebellion in 264, but his troops rebelled against him and killed both him and Jiang Wei, with Sima Zhao going on to bestow an amnesty upon all in Shu.

==Death==
After Zhong Hui&#x27;s rebellion was defeated, Sima Zhao was granted the title of King of Jin on 2 May 264, the penultimate step to usurpation. He set out to revise the laws and the civil service system in accordance with how he would want his own empire to be, such as instating the Five Feudal Ranks of Zhou (a system which had fallen out of use since the Qin dynasty abolished it), and also going on to posthumously enfeoff his father, Sima Yi, and older brother, Sima Shi, as King Xuan of Jin and King Jing of Jin respectively. He further sought peace with Eastern Wu, to prevent further complications for his planned takeover, a gesture that was reciprocated.

Later that year, Sima Zhao considered whom to make his heir. He strongly considered his talented younger son, Sima You, who had been adopted by Sima Shi because Sima Shi did not have sons of his own, under the rationale that because Sima Shi had great achievement in the Simas&#x27; obtaining and retaining of power, the succession should go back to his son. The majority of his advisors, however, recommended his oldest son, Sima Yan, instead, and Sima Zhao finally resolved to make Sima Yan his designated heir.

On 6 September 265, Sima Zhao died before he could receive actual imperial authority, although he was buried with imperial honors on 20 October 265. Five months later, however, Sima Yan, who had previously inherited his father&#x27;s authority, would have the Wei emperor, Cao Huan, abdicate in favour of him, ending Wei and establishing the Jin dynasty. After he did so, he posthumously honoured his father, Sima Zhao, as Emperor Wen of Jin (晉文帝).

==In popular culture==
Sima Zhao is first introduced as a playable character in the seventh instalment of Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; video game series, in which he is depicted as having a lazy and carefree atmosphere, but underneath it actually being a talented leader and strategist. He is then introduced again as a playable character in &quot;Warriors Orochi 3&quot;.

<text>Ipswich School is a public school (English fee-charging boarding and day school) for pupils aged 3 to 18 in Ipswich, Suffolk, England.

North of the town centre, Ipswich School has four parts on three adjacent sites. The Pre-Prep and Nursery were established in 1883 with the aim of preparing children aged 7 to 11 for entry into the Senior School. The Senior School occupies the main school site. The main buildings are a distinctive example of Victorian architecture, with Tudor style brick. The main building and chapel are both Grade II listed. The school buildings surround a central playing field and cricket square along with the Cricket Pavilion. The remainder of the School&#x27;s sport&#x27;s fields are located at a nearby site on the edge of the town. The School has a new purpose-built music school, adjacent to the Cricket Pavilion.

Within the Senior School the students are divided into three: the Lower School (Years 7 and 8), the Middle School (Years 9–11) and the Sixth Form (Years 12 and 13).

The School operates on an independent, fee-charging basis, with a few scholarships including sports, academic and art and music and means-tested bursaries. It selects pupils by the use of entrance exams.
The School was designated as having a Church of England Religious Character. The school has, however, not chosen to register as having a Religious Charter under the 2009 order.

== History ==

The oldest record that may refer to the school in Ipswich goes back to 1399, in a legal dispute over unpaid fees. The first recorded mention of a grammar school in Ipswich is 1416. The school was most likely set up by the Merchant Guild of Ipswich, which became the Guild of Corpus Christi. The sons of the ruling burgesses were educated for a fee, and the sons of nobility and gentry could attend at higher fees.

From 1483 the school moved to a house bequeathed by ex-pupil Richard Felaw, a merchant and politician. His will also provided rental income for the school and stated that, for Ipswich children, only those parents with income over a certain amount should pay fees.
===Cardinal&#x27;s College of Mary in Ipswich===

In 1528, building work began on an ambitious project for a &#x27;college&#x27; school in Ipswich to rival the likes of Eton College. Thomas Wolsey, Cardinal Archbishop of York and Lord Chancellor of England, funded his &#x27;College of St Mary&#x27; by &#x27;&#x27;suppressing&#x27; local religious houses such as Rumburgh Priory. Ipswich school was incorporated into the college. Wolsey, who was from Ipswich and may have attended Ipswich school, intended the new institution to be a feeder to his recently built &#x27;Cardinal&#x27;s College&#x27; of Oxford University, which is now known as Christ Church. However, Wolsey fell out of favour with King Henry VIII and the college in Ipswich was demolished in 1530 while still half-built. The school pupils returned to Felaw&#x27;s house.

The play &quot;Henry VIII&quot; by William Shakespeare mentions the two colleges during a recounting of the life of Cardinal Wolsey; it was the college of Oxford University that outlasted him and became widely known:

&#x27;Those twins of learning that he rais&#x27;d in you,
Ipswich and Oxford! One of which fell with him,
Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;
The other, though unfinish&#x27;d, yet so famous&#x27;
===Ipswich School from Elizabeth I to 1614===

After Wolsey&#x27;s downfall in 1530, his former ally Thomas Cromwell ensured the survival of the School by securing for it a new endowment from King Henry VIII and the status of a royal foundation. This was confirmed by Queen Elizabeth I in the charter that she granted to the School in 1566. For part of the School&#x27;s history it was known as Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School, Ipswich. The School&#x27;s coat of arms and motto, Semper Eadem (Always the Same), are those of Elizabeth I. The Monarch of the United Kingdom is the School&#x27;s Visitor.
===From 1614 to 1851===
In 1614 the school moved across the road to the Blackfriar&#x27;s refectory. During the reign of James I part of the Blackfriars Monastery was appropriated for use as a classroom, and the Blackfriars remained the School&#x27;s home until 1842 when the building was deemed to be unsafe. For a few years teaching was carried on in temporary premises in Lower Brook Street.

===Since 1851===
In 1851 Prince Albert laid the foundation stone for the School&#x27;s first purpose-built premises in Henley Road. By 1852 the new buildings were in use. The School has remained on the Henley Road site ever since.

The Town Library of Ipswich with books dating back to the 15th century is located in the headmaster&#x27;s study where it is held by the school on behalf of the town of Ipswich.

===Current school organisation===
More recently the School has moved away from the traditional full boarding ethos still held by similar schools such as Eton and Harrow. The number of boarding houses has reduced to one and the majority of students are day pupils. The School has flourished under this new approach.

===Houses===
The school has six day houses – Holden, Rigaud, Sherrington, School, Broke and Felaw – into which all pupils are filtered from year 9/Upper 6th Form onwards, and a single large boarding house – Westwood. There is a good deal of competition between the houses and every year, the houses compete for the Ganzoni Cup (house cup), which is won by gaining points from winning inter-house events. These include most sports as well as others such as debating and art. The final and most important event is Sports Day, in the Summer Term, on which the athletics competitions take place. School is the oldest house and dates from the days when the boys lived and were taught in one house (called School House). It later became the boarding house which occupied a part of the main building on Henley Road.

The school&#x27;s single boarding house is called Westwood. Westwood is no longer a part of the school house system where students were organised into school houses depending on which boarding house they were in. For example, Sherrington House occupied Highwood and, as previously mentioned, School House occupied part of the main Victorian building on Henley Road.

=== Sports and activities ===
The school offers a wide selection of sports, ranging from the traditional rugby, hockey, netball and cricket, to others such as indoor hockey, sailing, and Eton Fives, being one of a handful of schools in the country to have Fives courts. The school also offers other activities, including the Torino Debating Society, the Dead Poets Society (for A-Level English students) led by Sixth Form pupils, a Sub Aqua Club, Duke of Edinburgh Award, and a Combined Cadet Force with Army and Air Force sections. The school&#x27;s music department provides several orchestras, ensembles, and choirs. Plays are staged every year, in either Great School or Little School.

====Cricket Ground====
The first recorded cricket match on the school ground was in 1859, when Suffolk played an All-England Eleven. The ground hosted its first Minor Counties Championship match in 1935 when Suffolk played Hertfordshire. To date the ground has hosted 33 Minor Counties Championship matches and 2 MCCA Knockout Trophy matches.

The ground has also hosted a single List A match between Suffolk and Kent in the 1966 Gillette Cup.

=== School publications ===
The three main publications are &quot;The Ipswichian&quot; which is the annual School magazine, &quot;The OI Journal&quot; which is a publication for Old Ipswichians and &quot;The Occasional&quot;. &quot;The Occasional&quot; is the school newspaper published every Monday and is written by pupils. It is edited by the Communications Manager. It contains articles of note and interest to the members of the school such as sports results and upcoming events. It has recently celebrated its 1000th issue.

<doc id="630999" wikidata="Q6842310" url="?curid=630999" title="Midland Beach, Staten Island">
<text>Midland Beach (formerly known as Woodland Beach) is a neighborhood of Staten Island in New York City. It lies along the east-central coast of the island, in the area known locally as the &quot;Mid-Island, Staten Island&quot; or the &quot;East Shore&quot;.

To its immediate northwest is Grant City, to the southeast is New Dorp Beach, and to the northeast are Graham Beach and South Beach. Miller Field and Prescott Avenue form the southwest border (formerly, a lane called Maplewood Terrace paralleled New Dorp Lane); Poultney Street/Laconia Avenue is to the northwest; the Lower New York Bay is to the southeast, and Seaview Avenue is to the northeast. Father Capodanno Boulevard and Midland Avenue are Midland Beach&#x27;s two main arteries.

Midland Beach is part of Staten Island Community District 2 and its ZIP Codes are 10305 and 10306. Midland Beach is patrolled by the 122nd Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

==History==
=== Resort years ===
Midland Beach became a resort by the 1890s when the Staten Island Railway&#x27;s South Beach Branch came to nearby Wentworth Avenue, where there were transfers to trolleys serving the area. It contained a pier jutting into the Atlantic Ocean, where visitors could catch the steamboat &quot;William Story&quot; to the Battery at the tip of Lower Manhattan. The pier was so long that the Midland Beach Railway Company operated a miniature railroad to take fishermen and other visitors to the end of the pier. Around 1900, there was a disagreement between operators of Midland Beach and the town to the south, Woodland Beach, due to the pier&#x27;s location close to the border between the towns. A fence along the beach was repeatedly erected and torn down, and the dispute was only resolved several years later.

Nevertheless, Midland Beach became a popular destination, easily visible from Coney Island across the Lower New York Bay, and fireworks from Coney Island could be seen from Midland Beach at night. Like South Beach, it offered theater performances, a beach, picnicking areas, snack kiosks, an &quot;Aquarama&quot; panorama, and numerous hotels and bungalows. The attractions were also similar: they included Japanese bowling, a Thompson scenic railway, a dance pavilion, a carousel, a circle swing, and a theater. The beach also contained a boardwalk. Three separate wooden coasters were constructed along Midland Beach. Normally, no admission was charged, but the first admission fee was instituted at a carnival in June 1918, whereupon revenue from the 10-cent charge was donated to the American Red Cross. A saltwater swimming pool was added in 1924.

Midland Beach, like its northern neighbor South Beach, also saw several large fires and other severe incidents. For instance, a conflagration in 1916 damaged large portions of the resort. Rider incidents included a 1917 accident where a patron was left dangling from a roller coaster by his leg, and a miniature train derailment in 1918 that injured 12 people. An extreme thunderstorm in 1923 resulted in several buildings being set on fire by lightning, as well as trolley tracks being washed away by storm surges.

Midland Beach&#x27;s downfall was caused by two clusters of fires in 1924, though it continued to operate for five more years. In August 1924, two fires occurred on the pier: a small fire at its west end, followed by a much larger fire that nearly destroyed the pier. The fire severely reduced the ability of boats to travel to Midland Beach. In late September, a few weeks after the end of the season, a large fire burned or damaged 15 of the 5,000 summer bungalows at Midland Beach, as well as destroyed four hotels and most of the rides in the Midland Beach Resort. Many of the structures could not be rebuilt because the owners lacked insurance. The year after, James S. Graham purchased much of the remaining resort and rebuilt many of the attractions, including a scenic railroad, Barrel of Fun, Old Mill, skee-ball, and other smaller amusements. However, a fire in 1929 destroyed one-fourth of the rebuilt park, and Midland Beach was subsequently used primarily for swimming, with the beach being restricted and visitors charged a 25-cent fee. The fee was repealed by order of the city in 1930.

===Residential neighborhood===
Rainstorms on the island caused wind or water damage (such as flooded bungalows) in Midland Beach in the 1970s, due to its proximity to the coast and lack of storm sewers. The City of New York installed a large new storm sewer system down Greeley Avenue in 1979, which resolved the flooding issues for most of the newer housing stock in the neighborhood. Today, the bungalows built as summer homes are owned or rented by locals for permanent residence. According to data compiled by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, the parish of St. Margaret Mary, which serves Midland Beach, is a middle-class parish on Staten Island based on per-capita income.

The neighborhood once had its own post office branch, bearing the postal code &quot;Staten Island 11, New York.&quot; The building that housed the post office, located at 553 Lincoln Avenue, was one of the smallest. The post office closed in 1949.

The Ocean Breeze Fishing Pier, a steel and concrete recreational pier, opened in September 2003. At , it is the largest oceanfront recreational pier built in the New York metropolitan area in over a century.

Midland Beach was devastated by the storm surge caused by Hurricane Sandy on October 29, 2012.

==Demographics==

For census purposes, the New York City government classifies Midland Beach as part of a larger neighborhood tabulation area called New Dorp-Midland Beach.

This is the same as the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 20% are between the ages of between 0–17, 25% between 25–44, and 29% between 45–64.

==Bluebelt==
The Midland Beach (New Creek) Bluebelt, part of the larger Staten Island Bluebelt, is now being constructed by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection throughout the northern edge of the neighborhood, where most of the bungalows stand. This comprehensive watershed wetlands will alleviate much of the flooding that occurs in this low-lying area. The land will be protected for passive residential use and absorb storm water runoff. Stone bridges, culverts, viaducts, walls and tree plantings will beautify the neighborhood and eventually eliminate the blight that has plagued the northern edge of Midland Beach since the 1960s.

<text>Cariacica is a municipality in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil, part of the Greater Vitória metropolitan area.

==Geography==

Cariacica is located 10 km northwest of Vitória, the capital of the state. It has a population of 383,917 (2020) and forms part of the Greater Vitória metropolitan area.

The municipality contains the Duas Bocas Biological Reserve, created in 1991 to protect part of the water supply.

==History==
Before the arrival of the colonists to this area, Tupiniquim Indians made this area their home. The name &quot;Cariacica&quot; comes from their language, meaning &quot;the arrival of white men&quot;. Cariacica was created as a district of Vitória on 18 December 1837. Its full name as it was given by the Catholic Church is &quot;Freguesia de São João Batista de Cariacica&quot;, after Saint John the Baptist, the patron saint of the town. On 30 December 1890 Cariacica separated fully from the municipality of Vitória, becoming the capital of its own municipality. Since 24 July 1971 Saint John the Baptist&#x27;s day has been the city&#x27;s commemorative day.

==Colonization==
After the initial settlement instigated as a point of contact between the capital Vitória and the interior, between 1829 and 1833 some Pomeranian families arrived to the area. Population increased much more significantly after 1865, because of the formation of German colonies which headed to Santa Leopoldina and Santa Isabel. In 1837 a group of Portuguese also arrived to establish themselves in the rural district of the municipality.

==Sports==
Rio Branco Atlético Clube is a football club based in the city. The club is the most successful team of the state, being the club with most Campeonato Capixaba titles. It plays at Estádio Kléber Andrade. Another city&#x27;s football club is Desportiva Ferroviária.

<text>&lt;br&gt;&quot;Retired Canadian Hydrographic Service logo or crest&quot;
The Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) is part of the federal department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada and is Canada&#x27;s authoritative hydrographic office. The CHS represents Canada in the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO).

==Administration and mandate==
The CHS is administratively part of Fisheries and Oceans Canada&#x27;s Oceans and Ecosystems Science Sector. According to mandated obligations of the &quot;Oceans Act&quot; and the &quot;Canada Shipping Act&quot;, the CHS is led by the Hydrographer General of Canada who is responsible for gathering, managing, transforming and disseminating bathymetric, hydrographic and nautical data and information into paper and electronic nautical charts, as well as publications and “hydrospatial” (blue geospatial) data and services, including updating services of: broadcast Navigational Warnings and/or Notices to Mariners; and, other publications, data and services of: Tide &amp; Current Tables; water levels observations in near-real time, real-time and forecasting; Sailing Directions and hydrospatial dynamic data, products and services primarily for safe and efficient navigation in Canadian waters and much more.

CHS is responsible for leading and coordinating the Government of Canada&#x27;s implementation of a Marine Spatial (Hydrospatial) Data Infrastructure (HDI=MSDI) as a key oceans and freshwater component of the Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure (CGDI). MSDI (or HDI) compatible and interoperable globally within the directions and framework of the United Nations Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM). Feeding and guiding future needs and requirements, such as standard near real-time and real-time Hydrographic and Hydrospatial Dynamic Products, for safe and efficient navigation, and serve new technologies such as Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS); in close collaboration with Natural Resources Canada&#x27;s (NRCan) Mapping and Earth Observation (CCMEO) Branch colleagues.

==History==
Prior to Confederation, responsibilities for hydrographic survey and chart production in British North America rested with the Royal Navy.

In 1882, the loss of the steamship SS &quot;Asia&quot; on an uncharted shoal in Georgian Bay resulted in 150 fatalities and was Canada&#x27;s worst maritime disaster at the time. On August 13, 1883, the Dominion government established the Georgian Bay Survey which was empowered by legislation with the responsibility to survey and chart navigable waters of Georgian Bay and Lake Huron.

Surveying and charting was extended to Canada&#x27;s Pacific coast in 1891, tidal and current metering nationwide began in 1893, surveying and charting extended to the Maritimes by 1905, and water level gauging of the Great Lakes began in 1912.

In 1904, a Privy Council order renamed the Georgian Bay Survey to the Hydrographic Survey of Canada with some modified responsibilities. In 1913 one of Canada&#x27;s most famous hydrographic survey vessels, CSS &quot;Acadia&quot; was commissioned for use on the Atlantic coast. In 1928, the organization was renamed to the Canadian Hydrographic Service. Responsibility was extended on March 31, 1949, with the entry of Newfoundland into Confederation, with CHS taking over surveys and charting around the island of Newfoundland and the coast of Labrador from the Royal Navy.

==Technology==
CHS is a world leader in the adoption of hydrographic survey technology, as well as in research and development. With responsibility for charting the world&#x27;s longest coastline (243,792 kilometres) as well as 6.55 million square kilometres of continental shelf and territorial waters (second largest in the world), including extensive inland waterways such as the St. Lawrence Seaway, CHS maintains a world-record inventory of more than 1,000 published charts. As such, the organization was an early adopter of single-beam sonar, radio-navigation positioning systems, and computer processing and storage.

The joint Canada-U.S. DEW Line also necessitated innovative surveying techniques throughout remote northern areas in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago in support of ships carrying logistics and construction material. CHS is one of the only hydrographic offices in the world with the capability to undertake Arctic surveying, frequently operating in waters that are frozen between 10 and 12 months of the year.

CHS has migrated from single-beam sonar to becoming a major user of multi-beam echo-sounder sonar systems coupled with GPS to achieve improved survey accuracies. CHS was also one of the first organizations in the world to develop airborne LiDAR technology, with the LARSEN-500 sensor being used for remote Arctic surveys. Survey data processing software provided by companies such as CARIS and Helical Systems, as well as the development of Oracle Spatial database storage, are spin-offs from research developments at CHS, and are now used throughout the world by other Hydrographic Offices and in the geo-spatial technology industry. CHS demonstrates international leadership in influencing, contributing, developing and adopting: hydrographic standards (S-100); crowd-sourced bathymetry (CSB); satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB); GEneral Bathymetric Charts of the Oceans (GEBCO) and the Seabed2030 project; autonomous hydrographic surface vehicles (AHSV); and the implementation of a Marine Spatial (Hydrospatial) Data Infrastructure (MSDI) as an Hydrospatial Office. CHS is also involved in the successful implementation of new technologies such as: autonomous hydrographic vehicles (surface, underwater, airborne and/or micro-satellites); Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS); and many more in the context of the emerging hydrographic and hydrospatial artificial intelligence within hydrospatial.

==Department of Fisheries and Oceans==
Unlike most nations, CHS is not part of Canada&#x27;s navy, but is rather a civilian scientific organization under the federal government&#x27;s Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) Science Sector. Most of the survey vessels employed by CHS are nominally crewed and operated by the Canadian Coast Guard, also part of DFO. CHS also works in collaboration with the Royal Canadian Navy and other ships and vessels of opportunity from other international hydrographic offices, primarily the US Office of Coast Survey (OCS) of the National Ocean Service (NOS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other academic and industry partners.

The incumbent of the Director General of CHS position is also called the &quot;&quot;&quot;Hydrographer General of Canada&quot; to reflect the important liability associated with the responsibilities coming from the previous original title, &quot;Dominion Hydrographer,&quot; which dates to the earliest days of hydrographic surveying in Canada.

<text>Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel (; known until 1996 as Saint-Léonard) is a federal electoral district within the City of Montreal in Quebec, Canada, which has been represented in the House of Commons since 1988. Its population during the 2011 election was 108,811.

Since 2019, its Member of Parliament (MP) has been Patricia Lattanzio of the Liberal Party, the first woman to represent the district. The district is one of the safest Liberal districts in all of Canada, having re-elected Lattanzio with over 69% of the vote in 2021.

==Geography==
The district is located in the north eastern part of the Island of Montreal. The district includes the entire borough of Saint-Leonard, and the neighbourhood of Saint-Michel which is a part of the borough of Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension and a small part of the borough of Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie lying northwesterly of Bélanger Street.

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2021 Canadian census&quot;

* Languages (2021 mother tongue): 33.4% French, 17.0% Italian, 12.0% Arabic, 8.6% Spanish, 6.8% English, 6.2% Creole, 2.8% Vietnamese, 1.6% Kabyle, 1.4% Portuguese, 1.1% Khmer, 0.9% Cantonese, 0.9% Tamil, 0.8% Turkish, 0.5% Romanian, 0.5% Bengali, 0.4% Min Nan, 0.4% Mandarin, 0.3% Greek, 0.3% Polish, 0.3% Ukrainian

==History==

&quot;Saint-Léonard&quot; riding was first created in 1976 from parts of Maisonneuve—Rosemont, Mercier and Saint-Michel ridings. The name of the riding was changed in 1977 to Saint-Léonard—Anjou before an election was held. It consisted of the City of Saint-Léonard, the Town of Anjou, and part of the City of Montreal.

The neighbouring ridings are Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, Papineau, Ahuntsic, Bourassa, Honoré-Mercier, and Hochelaga.

The current electoral district was created as &quot;Saint-Léonard&quot; riding in 1987 from parts of Gamelin and Saint-Léonard—Anjou ridings. In 1996, its name was changed to &quot;Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel&quot; when its boundaries changed and now included part of the neighbourhood of Saint-Michel.

This riding lost some territory to Papineau, and gained territory from Ahuntsic and Hochelaga during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

During the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel lost territory north of Boul. Langelier and west of Rue Bombardier to Honoré-Mercier; This leaves part of the borough of Saint-Léonard in that riding. The boundary with Hochelaga along Rue Bélanger moved to the borough boundary between Rosemont—La-Petite-Patrie and Saint-Léonard.

<text>Braunbuch – Kriegs- und Nazi-verbrecher in der Bundesrepublik: Staat – Wirtschaft – Verwaltung – Armee – Justiz – Wissenschaft (English title: Brown Book – War and Nazi Criminals in the Federal Republic: State, Economy, Administration, Army, Justice, Science) is a book edited by Albert Norden in 1965. In this book Norden claimed that 1,800 politicians and other prominents in West Germany held prominent positions in Germany prior to 1945.

Altogether 1,800 West German persons and their past were covered: especially 21 Ministers and state secretaries, 100 admirals and generals, 828 judges or state lawyers and high law officers, 245 officials of the Foreign Office and of embassies and consulates in leading position, 297 high police officers and officers of the Verfassungsschutz. The first brown book was seized in West Germany – on Frankfurt Book Fair – by judicial resolution.

The contents of this book received substantial attention in West Germany and other countries. The West German government stated, at that time, that it was &quot;all falsification&quot;. Later on, however, it became clear that the data of the book were largely correct. Hanns Martin Schleyer, for example, really had been a member of the SS. The book was translated into 10 languages. Amongst the reactions to it was also a similar West German book of the same name, covering the topic of Nazis re-emerging in high-level positions in the GDR.

In addition to the &quot;Braunbuch&quot; the educational booklet &quot;Das ganze System ist braun&quot; (&quot;The whole system is brown&quot;) was published in the GDR.

<doc id="631040" wikidata="Q3712521" url="?curid=631040" title="Dofetilide">
<text>Dofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic agent. It is marketed under the trade name Tikosyn by Pfizer, and is available in the United States in capsules containing 125, 250, and 500 μg of dofetilide. It is not available in Europe or Australia.

==Medical uses==
Dofetilide is used for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in individuals prone to the occurrence of atrial fibrillation and flutter arrhythmias, and for chemical cardioversion to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation and flutter. 

Based on the results of the Danish Investigations of Arrhythmias and Mortality on Dofetilide (&quot;DIAMOND&quot;) study, dofetilide does not affect mortality in the treatment of patients post-myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction, however it was shown to decrease all-cause readmissions as well as CHF-related readmissions. Because of the results of the DIAMOND study, some physicians use dofetilide in the suppression of atrial fibrillation in individuals with LV dysfunction, however use appears limited: After initially receiving marketing approval in Europe in 1999, Pfizer voluntarily withdrew this approval in 2004 for commercial reasons and it is not registered in other first world countries. 

It has clinical advantages over other class III antiarrhythmics in chemical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, and maintenance of sinus rhythm, and does not have the pulmonary or hepatotoxicity of amiodarone, however atrial fibrillation is not generally considered life-threatening, and dofetilide causes an increased rate of potentially life-threatening arrhythmias in comparison to other therapies.

== Contraindications ==
Prior to administration of the first dose, the corrected QT (QTc) must be determined. If the QTc is greater than 440 msec (or 500 msec in patients with ventricular conduction abnormalities), dofetilide is contraindicated. If heart rate is less than 60 bpm, the uncorrected QT interval should be used. After each subsequent dose of dofetilide, QTc should be determined and dosing should be adjusted.

If at any time after the second dose of dofetilide the QTc is greater than 500 msec (550 msec in patients with ventricular conduction abnormalities), dofetilide should be discontinued. 

==Adverse effects==
Torsades de pointes is the most serious side effect of dofetilide therapy. The incidence of torsades de pointes is 0.3-10.5% and is dose-related, with increased incidence associated with higher doses. The majority of episodes of torsades de pointes have occurred within the first three days of initial dosing. Patients should be hospitalized and monitored for the first three days after starting dofetilide.

The risk of inducing torsades de pointes can be decreased by taking precautions when initiating therapy, such as hospitalizing individuals for a minimum of three days for serial creatinine measurement, continuous telemetry monitoring and availability of cardiac resuscitation.

==Pharmacology==

=== Mechanism of action ===
Dofetilide works by selectively blocking the rapid component of the delayed rectifier outward potassium current (IKr).

This causes the refractory period of atrial tissue to increase, hence its effectiveness in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

Dofetilide does not affect dV/dTmax (the slope of the upstroke of phase 0 depolarization), conduction velocity, or the resting membrane potential.

There is a dose-dependent increase in the QT interval and the corrected QT interval (QTc). Because of this, many practitioners will initiate dofetilide therapy only on individuals under telemetry monitoring or if serial EKG measurements of QT and QTc can be performed.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Peak plasma concentrations are seen two to three hours after oral dosing when fasting. Dofetilide is well absorbed in its oral form, with a bioavailability of &gt;90%. Intravenous administration of dofetilide is not available in the United States.

The elimination half-life of dofetilide is roughly 10 hours; however, this varies based on many physiologic factors (most significantly creatinine clearance), and ranges from 4.8 to 13.5 hours. Due to the significant level of renal elimination (80% unchanged, 20% metabolites), the dose of dofetilide must be adjusted to prevent toxicity due to impaired renal function.

Dofetilide is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 enzymes predominantly in the liver and GI tract. This means that it is likely to interact with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, or ketoconazole, resulting in higher and potentially toxic levels of dofetilide.

====Metabolism====
A steady-state plasma level of dofetilide is achieved in 2–3 days.

80% of dofetilide is excreted by the kidneys, so the dose of dofetilide should be adjusted in individuals with chronic kidney disease, based on creatinine clearance.

In the kidneys, dofetilide is eliminated via cation exchange (secretion). Agents that interfere with the renal cation exchange system, such as verapamil, cimetidine, hydrochlorothiazide, itraconazole, ketoconazole, prochlorperazine, and trimethoprim should not be administered to individuals taking dofetilide.

About 20 percent of dofetilide is metabolized in the liver via the CYP3A4 isoenzyme of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Drugs that interfere with the activity of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme can increase serum dofetilide levels. If the renal cation exchange system is interfered with (as with the medications listed above), a larger percentage of dofetilide is cleared via the CYP3A4 isoenzyme system.
== History ==
After its initial US FDA approval, due to the pro-arrhythmic potential, it was only made available to hospitals and prescribers that had received education and undergone specific training in the risks of treatment with dofetilide; however, this restriction was subsequently removed in 2016.

<doc id="631045" wikidata="Q1418132" url="?curid=631045" title="Smith number">
<text>In number theory, a Smith number is a composite number for which, in a given number base, the sum of its digits is equal to the sum of the digits in its prime factorization in the same base. In the case of numbers that are not square-free, the factorization is written without exponents, writing the repeated factor as many times as needed.

Smith numbers were named by Albert Wilansky of Lehigh University, as he noticed the property in the phone number (493-7775) of his brother-in-law Harold Smith:
: 4937775 = 3 · 5 · 5 · 65837
while 
: 4 + 9 + 3 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 5 = 3 + 5 + 5 + (6 + 5 + 8 + 3 + 7)
in base 10. 

==Mathematical definition==
Let formula_1 be a natural number. For base formula_2, let the function formula_3 be the digit sum of formula_1 in base formula_5. A natural number formula_1 with prime factorization
formula_7
is a Smith number if
formula_8
Here the exponent formula_9 is the multiplicity of formula_10 as a prime factor of formula_1 (also known as the &quot;p&quot;-adic valuation of formula_1).

For example, in base 10, 378 = 21 · 33 · 71 is a Smith number since 3 + 7 + 8 = 2 · 1 + 3 · 3 + 7 · 1, and 22 = 21 · 111 is a Smith number, because 2 + 2 = 2 · 1 + (1 + 1) · 1.

The first few Smith numbers in base 10 are
:4, 22, 27, 58, 85, 94, 121, 166, 202, 265, 274, 319, 346, 355, 378, 382, 391, 438, 454, 483, 517, 526, 535, 562, 576, 588, 627, 634, 636, 645, 648, 654, 663, 666, 690, 706, 728, 729, 762, 778, 825, 852, 861, 895, 913, 915, 922, 958, 985. 

== Properties ==
W.L. McDaniel in 1987 proved that there are infinitely many Smith numbers.
The number of Smith numbers in base 10 below 10&quot;n&quot; for &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, ... is given by
: 1, 6, 49, 376, 3294, 29928, 278411, 2632758, 25154060, 241882509, ... .

Two consecutive Smith numbers (for example, 728 and 729, or 2964 and 2965) are called Smith brothers. It is not known how many Smith brothers there are. The starting elements of the smallest Smith &quot;n&quot;-tuple (meaning &quot;n&quot; consecutive Smith numbers) in base 10 for &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, ... are
: 4, 728, 73615, 4463535, 15966114, 2050918644, 164736913905, ... .

Smith numbers can be constructed from factored repunits. , the largest known Smith number in base 10 is
:9 × R1031 × (104594 + 3 + 1)1476 
where R1031 is the base 10 repunit (101031 − 1)/9.

<text>Davenport is a federal electoral district in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1935.

==Demographics==
The Davenport riding has the highest percentage of ethnic Portuguese of all Canadian federal ridings (27.4%), and the highest percentage of European immigrants (28.5%, of whom 25.0% are from Southern Europe, and 19.2% from Southern European countries other than Italy), in all of Canada. It also has the highest percentage of native speakers of Portuguese (20.7%) and of Romance languages other than the French language of Canada (32.0%, with many Italian and Spanish). The same holds true for home language (Portuguese: 14.0%; non-French Romance languages: 21.2%, both Canadian riding records)

:&quot;According to the 2021 Canadian census; 2013 representation

Languages: 54.2% English, 14.3% Portuguese, 4.9% Spanish, 3.4% Italian, 2.3% Yue, 1.6% Vietnamese, 1.5% French, 1.3% Tagalog, 1.1% Mandarin
Religions: 48.2% Christian (35.6% Catholic, 1.9% Christian Orthodox, 1.3% Anglican), 40.5% No religion, 3.4% Jewish, 3% Muslim, 2.3% Buddhist, 1.4% Hindu 
Median income (2020): $40,400 
Average income (2020): $55,550

==Geography==
The district includes parts of west-end Toronto, and includes the neighbourhoods of Fairbank, Oakwood-Vaughan, St. Clair Gardens, Corso Italia, Dovercourt Village, Bloordale Village, Bloorcourt Village, Brockton Village, the Junction Triangle and the western part of Rua Acores.

==History==
The federal electoral district was created in 1933 from parts of Parkdale and Toronto Northwest ridings.

The federal riding of Davenport has been one of the most consistently Liberal ridings in Canada over the last century.

In 1958, Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament Douglas Morton was elected. Since then, Liberals Walter Gordon and Charles Caccia (who himself held the seat for nearly 40 years) won the seat by increasing margins, finally culminating in a 17,500-vote majority in 1993. Meanwhile, the opposition parties in the constituency were shifting, and the New Democratic Party candidate beat the Progressive Conservative or Conservative candidate in every election since 1979.

In late 2003, Charles Caccia lost the Liberal nomination for the seat to local city councillor Mario Silva, who then went on to win the election and serve as Davenport&#x27;s Member of Parliament.

In 2011, Andrew Cash of the New Democratic Party won the seat, becoming the first non-Liberal in 49 years to represent the riding. In 2015, Cash was defeated by Liberal candidate Julie Dzerowicz, who became the first female Member of Parliament for Davenport. Dzerowicz ran for re-election in 2019 and won, again defeating Andrew Cash.

This riding lost a fraction of territory to Toronto—St. Paul&#x27;s during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

==Members of Parliament==

This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:

<text>Emperor of the French (French: &quot;Empereur des Français&quot;) was the title of the monarch and supreme ruler of the First French Empire and the Second French Empire. The emperor of France was an absolute monarch.

==Details==

A title and office used by the House of Bonaparte starting when Napoleon Bonaparte was proclaimed Emperor on 18 May 1804 by the Senate and was crowned Emperor of the French on 2 December 1804 at the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris, in Paris, with the Crown of Napoleon.

The title of &quot;Emperor of the French&quot; was also supposed to demonstrate that Napoleon&#x27;s coronation was not a restoration of the monarchy, but an introduction of a new political system: the French Empire. The title emphasized that the emperor governed over &quot;the French people&quot; (the nation) with their consent, did not rule over France (the state), and was an office under the French Republic similar to the previous office of First Consul. The old formula of &quot;King of France&quot; indicated that the king owned France as a personal possession. The new term indicated a constitutional monarchy. The title was purposely created to preserve the appearance of the French Republic and to show that after the French Revolution, the feudal system was abandoned and a nation state was created, with equal citizens governed by their emperor. Emperor also harkened back to the Roman Republic title of Imperator, as a magistrate who exercised Imperium or command, especially over an army. This emphasized Napoleon as Chief Magistrate and Commander-in-Chief elected by the citizens. 

Taking the title &quot;emperor&quot; also emphasized that the will of the citizens of France was equal in sovereignty to anyone&#x27;s, especially to what had been until this time the highest sovereignty in the Western world: the (Holy) Roman Emperor, who claimed continuity with the ancient Roman Emperors, and whose coronation by the Pope was used to claim authority by divine right.

It was only after 1 January 1809 that the state was officially referred to as the French Empire and not the French Republic.

Emperor also harkened back to the Roman Republic title of Imperator, a magistrate who exercised Imperium or command, especially over an army. After an especially great victory, an army&#x27;s troops in the field would proclaim their commander &quot;imperator&quot;, an acclamation necessary for a general to apply to the Senate for a triumph.

Napoleon&#x27;s reign lasted until 22 June 1815, when he was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo, exiled, and imprisoned on the island of Saint Helena, where he died on 5 May 1821. His reign was interrupted by the Bourbon Restoration of 1814 and his exile to Elba, from where he escaped less than a year later to reclaim the throne, reigning as Emperor for another 111 days before his final defeat and exile.

Less than a year after the 1851 French coup d&#x27;état by Napoleon&#x27;s nephew Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, which ended in the successful dissolution of the French National Assembly, the French Second Republic was transformed into the Second French Empire, established by a referendum on 7 November 1852. President Bonaparte, elected by the French people, officially became Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, from the symbolic and historic date of 2 December 1852. His rule would &quot;de facto&quot; end on 28 July 1870 - the power of the head of state was transferred to his wife Eugenie de Montijo who would rule as empress regent of France while Napoleon III left with his army. His reign would nominally continue until 4 September 1870, as he was officially deposed after his defeat and capture at the Battle of Sedan during the Franco-Prussian War. In March 1871, he would be released from Prussian custody and exiled to the United Kingdom, where he died on 9 January 1873.

Since the death of Napoleon III&#x27;s only son, Louis-Napoléon in 1879, the House of Bonaparte has had a number of claimants to the French throne. The current claimant is Charles, Prince Napoléon, who became head of the House of Bonaparte on 3 May 1997. His position is challenged by his son, Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon, who was named as heir in his late grandfather&#x27;s testament.

<text>, also known as &quot;lute priests&quot;, were travelling performers in the era of Japanese history preceding the Meiji period. They earned their income by reciting vocal literature to the accompaniment of music. were mostly blind, and adopted the shaved heads and robes common to Buddhist monks. The occupation likely had its origin in China and India, where blind Buddhist lay-priest performers were once common.

The musical style of the is referred to as , which literally means &quot; music&quot;. Although these performers existed well before the events of the Genpei War, they eventually became famous for narrating tales about this war. Before sang , they were entertainers and ritual performers. They took on a broad range of roles, including poetry and song, plague prevention, and spiritual purification; actually, it was probably because of their ritualistic duties that they became the caretakers of .

The are considered the first performers of the &quot;Tale of the Heike&quot;, which is one of Japan&#x27;s most famous epics. It details battles between two powerful clans, the Minamoto and the Taira around the 12th century. The Taira (or Heike) were eventually annihilated by the Minamoto (sometimes called the Genji), who systematically killed every male descendant of the Taira. Religion in Japan at the time incorporated many native animistic (Shinto) beliefs into its Buddhist theological framework, leading many court nobles and religious leaders to worry about angry Taira spirits disrupting the peace. The great earthquake around 1185 CE contributed to this sentiment. Since their rituals included placating spirits and preventing plagues, music became a vehicle for placating lingering, resentful Heike spirits. and became immensely popular for the next several hundred years.

==Etymology==

The two characters and mean &quot;Buddhist doctrine&quot; and &quot;teacher&quot; respectively. referred to blind priests who played the to accompany their songs about legends, wars, histories, and mythologies. Eventually, referred to non-blind and blind performers and was also used as a suffix to a series of other types of people, such as , , , and .

 are referred to in Japanese iconography that dates back to the late Heian period (794–1185 CE). They are also referred to in the , written by Fujiwara no Akihira (989–1066).

==History==
===Origins and proliferation===
Shōbutsu, a Buddhist monk of the Tendai school, was, according to tradition, the first to sing the , around the year 1220. Subsequently, two different factions of were formed. These were the Ichikata school, founded by Akashi Kyoichi, and the Yasaka School, founded by Yasaka Kigen. Ranks were assigned to on the basis of skill, the highest being , followed by , and .

The proliferation of the Yasaka and Ichikata factions heightened with the contributions of Akashi Kakuichi (1300–1371). A noted , Kakuichi&#x27;s narration is currently accepted as the definitive version of the . A documented reason for this is that Kakuichi was largely responsible for forming the Ichikata guild. This preceded the formation of the , a self-governing guild of . The Tōdō received income in two ways: patronage from the Kyoto aristocracy and military, and its monopoly over the teaching and transmission of . To be accepted as a disciple, an aspiring student would have to pay a fee, after which the study of each new piece of music required payment.

By the 13th and 14th centuries, performed for the military elite and the aristocracy, including the regional feudal lords. Public performances were also given during Buddhist temple services. The general population had the further option of attending Kanjin performances, which they were required to pay a fee to see.

===Sengoku to Edo period===
The Ōnin War (1467–1477) proved a trying occurrence for the proliferation of the . The war instigated the Sengoku period (15th–17th centuries), an era of civil war and political–military conflict that lasted for nearly two centuries. In this time, many musicians turned their attention to the or the three-stringed lute. Therefore, not only did the conflict cause a loss of performers, but also a decline in the number of listeners of the .

However, the complete demise of the was prevented by the Tokugawa Ieyasu who favored the art of performance. Ieyasu ultimately reunified the country by establishing the Tokugawa shogunate, and became a fervent patron of the .

During the Edo period (1600–1868), the Tokugawa shogunate provided the Tōdō with special privileges and substantial financing, which the Tōdō then distributed to members according to rank. The Edo period also marks the era in which the shogunate designated as one of its official ceremonial forms of music. Accordingly, new schools of appeared, many of which were influenced by the newly introduced and its accompanying styles of music. The two predominant schools that came about during the Edo period were the Maeda-ryū founded by Maeda Kyūichi, and the Hatano-ryū founded by Hatano Kōichi. Both figures were members of the Shidō-ha, which was the most active branch of the older Ichikata school.

Collaborations were formed between amateur aficionados of the who, over the course of the Edo period, made small revisions to the musical notation of the score. The ceremonial form of the performed for the shogunate became increasingly solemn and refined to meet the standards of the intellectual class. Moreover, to ensure the development of the score, improvisation notably declined.

===Meiji period to present===
In 1868, the Meiji Restoration heralded the collapse of the Tokugawa shogunate. This ultimately contributed to the abolition of the Tōdō, which undermined social privileges for the musicians and reduced the availability of avenues for performance. The Hatano-ryū, in particular, underwent a debilitating decline in popularity, so much so that it struggled to survive in Kyoto until the middle of the 20th century. In addition, the rise in popularity of the , which accompanied contemporary songs and narratives, made the ancient tales of the Heike appear antiquated. By the end of the Edo period, the had replaced the as the most common instrument used among blind musicians.

The tradition persisted, however, through the Tsugaru lineage (transmitted by sighted performers) and the Nagoya lineage (transmitted by professional blind musicians of the Tōdō tradition), both of which belonged to the Maeda-ryū. The Tsugaru lineage consisted of Kusumi Taisō (1815–1882), who learned the of the Edo Maeda-ryū, as well as his sons Tateyama Zennoshin and Tateyama Kōgo, both of whom lamented the decline of in the late years of Meiji and sought to foster a number of pupils. In Nagoya, a city which had been a thriving centre for performance, a small faction of blind male players continued to transmit alongside other mediums of music of growing popularity, such as the and . Differences exist between these lineages due to geographical separation and changes that have occurred uniquely in time. For example, the Nagoya lineage relied almost entirely on oral transmission. Nevertheless, the Nagoya and Tsugaru were both nominated by the Japanese government as &quot;Intangible Cultural Properties&quot; in 1955 and 1959 respectively, with Nagoya performers Inokawa Kōji, Doizaki Masatomi and Mishina Masayasu nominated as national treasures.

The libretto notation on which remaining performance is based today in Nagoya is called Heike Shosetsu. It was composed by Ogino Tomoichi (1732–1801), initially a disciple in the Hatano-ryū faction, before acquiring the post of in the Kyoto branch of the Maeda-ryū school; Tomoichi had great knowledge of both major schools as a Hatano-ryū disciple master. As such, he played a fundamental role in the revival of the .

Toru Takemitsu also contributed to the continuation of the by collaborating with Western composers. Recognising that traditional Japanese music, and interest in it, was quickly falling out of fashion, Takemitsu, as well as a number of composers before him, noted that studies in music theory and music composition almost entirely consisted of Western theory and instruction. Though some Western composers had begun to incorporate Japanese music and Japanese instruments into their compositions, these composers often focused on those Japanese instruments most similar to Western ones; for example, Michio Miyagi&#x27;s utilization of the . Takemitsu, on the other hand, collaborated with Western composers and compositions to include the distinctly Asian-sounding . His well-received compositions revitalized interest in the in the modern day.

According to Hugh de Ferranti, modern, live performances of narrative singing are rare, with almost all performers being &quot;practitioners of Chikuzen-biwa and Satsuma-biwa&quot;. The &quot;emerged from interaction between moso and the samurai class&quot; in Satsuma Province, starting a period of popularity for &quot;modern &quot; until the 1930s, while the had its origin in the 1890s in the Chikuzen region of Kyushu, drawing upon aspects of music, , and the technique. These traditions enjoyed widespread appreciation during the early 20th century due to the &quot;nationalist, militarist sentiments of late-Meiji imperialist ideology&quot;. In the post-war era, these traditions were considered &quot;refined classical pursuits&quot;, resulting in their popularity beyond . The itself is also depicted with the image of goddess Benzaiten at her shrines, and in images of the &quot;in homes, shops, and offices&quot;.
However, modern associations with are mainly connected to the , themselves linked to the &quot;Tale of Heike&quot; and &quot;Hōichi the Earless&quot;, well-known works taught in schools and readapted for television series, manga, popular literature and other media. As such, &quot;most Japanese come to think of the biwa as a battered old string instrument played by a decrepit blind man who looks like a Buddhist priest and wanders about chanting old tales about war and ghosts&quot;. According to Ferranti, &quot;outside of the realms of scholarship and the few who are involved in learning and performing&quot;, few Japanese civilians are familiar with the aural qualities of the and cannot recognize its tones with references to ancient war-tales. The instrument is viewed as antiquated, a relic of the past that &quot;cannot be a thing of contemporary Japanese life and experience, but is tied forever to the world of the &quot;Tale of the Heike&quot;; a gloomy world of martial valour and samurai ghosts&quot;.

== and in society==

===Blindness===
For most of Japan&#x27;s recorded history, music and narrative performance were common activities for the blind, whose importance in most other major genres is also unavoidable, save for court and theatre music, from the 13th century until the 19th. Folk and literature attest &quot;invariably about blind and &quot;, and only in modern times do sighted musicians master such instruments like the .

According to De Ferranti, the act of playing lutes for alms by blind musicians finds its roots in Indian Buddhist culture during the 1st millennium CE. As early as the 4th century, blind itinerants in South Asia, described by texts such as the as holy men, played lutes for alms. A 7th-century text from China and Japan&#x27;s early 12th-century recount this story, while other &quot;scattered accounts&quot; of blind lute-laying priests can be found in Tang-period volumes from the Chinese mainland. In the Shanbei region near Inner Mongolia, &quot;blind beggars who recited tales and travelled with pipa accompanists were common&quot;, prior to the 1949 revolution. Under Mao Zedong, blind itinerants called () played a three-string lute in &quot;household ritual contexts&quot; using their narrative &quot;as a potent force for social reform&quot; by the Communist Party.

Prior to the spread of Buddhism during the 6th to 9th centuries, it was &quot;generally acknowledged that in Japanese ritual life blind men and women [were] respected as shamanic celebrants who bore numinous power because of their separation from the world experienced by others&quot;. Historically, the blind performed healing rituals for curing illness and exorcising spirits. For music, plucking or striking string instruments also have ritual meanings, and were tasks probably given to blind individuals to perform in belief of their shamanistic abilities. The Azusa Yumi was utilized for summoning deities in a pre-Buddhist ritual, likely involving the blind. The role of early in delivery the vocal performance of battle tales &quot;to allay the fury of slain warriors&#x27; ghosts&quot; further implies a shamanistic qualification of the blind. Historical references suggest were involved in both divination and also in this fundamental role of placating aggravated spirits, especially those killed in battle.

The intimate ties between the and the blind in the Tōdō and various regional groups for further cement this inseparable relationship. Blindness was a necessary condition for membership in these organizations, which looked after blind performers and professionals and blind ritualists respectively. In the Tōdō, performers came to control the guild, and thus the lives of many Japanese blind people. According to the legends of these institutions, &quot;the lineage of blind players ultimately is traced to ... a blind disciple of the historical Buddha Shakyamuni, called Gankutsu Sonja&quot;.

However, according to Hugh de Ferranti, not all blind players of antiquity &quot;were completely lacking the sense of vision and knowledge of music&quot;. Indeed, many people called blind were likely &quot;only impaired in their vision&quot;, evidenced by the denotation of words for blind people such as , , and . Also, many blind individuals gain the ailment gradually, resulting from aging, illness, or accident, meaning literacy may have been acquired earlier in life. Hugh de Ferranti states that notable numbers of performers &quot;were sighted and in some cases literate&quot;, evidenced by records of the Jojuin tradition and historical membership of the Gensei Hōryū group. Such individuals thus must be acknowledged for potential importance in producing written texts and in the &quot;transmission of repertory&quot;.

===Religious significance===
Buddhist iconography throughout East and South-East Asia depict short-necked lutes being played by celestial beings as well as the Hindu goddess Saraswati, who led such divine musicians. Avatars of Sarasvati, &quot;the -playing Hindu goddess of music, wisdom, and eloquence&quot;, also play the lute in Tibetan and Chinese iconographic displays; such avatars correspond to Benzaiten, a Japanese deity known for holding a in her benevolent arms.

Japanese iconography indicates two female lute-playing deities: the aforementioned Benzaiten and Myōonten; their identities are often fused together, but both have their roots in the continental Asian tradition, and can be traced from Sarasvati through various forms. Benzaiten represents eloquence while Myōonten epitomizes music itself. As the bodhisattva named &quot;Miraculous Sound&quot;, Myōon Bōsatsu is described in the Lotus Sutra and was important for players in court society. Her influence would spread beyond the court, integrating itself especially in the tradition. After the early 8th century however, most sculptures and iconographic depictions show the pipa instead of the lute.

Locations whose name contain the characters or sounds also have sanctified lore. Lake Biwa is famous for Chikubu-shima, where Taira no Tsunemasa performs at the Benzaiten shrine, whose deity appears in the form of a white dragon. Especially in Kyushu, there are hills, valleys, ponds, and bridges throughout Japan, where performers supposedly buried or offered instruments to the local waters. Other legends of certain sects and accounts from ancient texts further the sacred associations of the instrument.

===Women===
Despite the depiction of Benzaiten, the patron deity of music revered by and , as a female entity and the existence of highly celebrated female players in 20th century, with the &quot;exception of avocational performance by women in the court music tradition&quot;, professional players were men until the &#x27;s use in the 16th century. Along with blindness, maleness was a necessary condition for admission to the and Tōdō. However, it was common in Tang China for women to play the pipa, as it was also common for courtly women from the Heian through Muromachi periods to learn in childhood. There are also a few rare references to both sighted and blind female entertainers who may have played , though in the Edo period, some female enthusiasts learned from professionals as a recreational activity.

Itinerant women performers did still exist in medieval Japan, though they are most frequently shown playing the drum. In the Edo period, singers called often accompanied themselves on the or , the latter of which was played by &quot;affluent blind women who taught it to the wives of samurai and merchants&quot;. The former along with its wooden imitation, were played for performance to procure alms, house to house; this was called . In Kyushu, were not uncommon with such performers mentioned in the Tōdō&#x27;s late-18th-century accounts. Although not bona fide members of the guild, held annual festivals, and this profession continued to be viable into the mid-1900s.

===Social status===
Though blindness in Japanese society has historically been stigmatized &quot;as the result of a Buddhist interpretation of the condition as a form of karmic punishment&quot;, other factors also led to the marginalization and discrimination of blind musicians. In general, the blind were treated according to the restrictions of their societal rank. In other words, commoner townsmen () and warrior–rank blind people &quot;were allowed to engage in the professions available to all of similar rank, within the constraints of their visual impairment&quot;, while those in agrarian households were expected to contribute to the payment of land taxes via any means of labor possible. However, the most common professions for all such peoples included music, massage, acupuncture and moxa therapy, while ritual work was common in specialized locations.

As for itinerant performers, the most affluent could &quot;make a living during the Edo period as teachers and performers based at their homes&quot;, while the rest (representing the majority of and ) relied on , regarded as a form of begging, despite its ritual associations. Door-to-door performances delivered by professionals associated to shrines and temples also occurred in the historical practice of seasonal rites and celebrations for farming areas; they were considered to be of low status by the middle class, however, and were affiliated with the Sanjō districts in which &quot;the discriminated classes&quot; lived. However, folk beliefs in the visits of during such harvest festivals to rid villagers of impurity upon receiving gifts from householders may have provided a socio-cultural basis for the willingness to offer food and money to itinerant performers; further, was seen as an act of merit.

According to Hugh de Ferranti, iconographic and literary sources generally portray as solitary and pitiable figures, though wealthy and powerful individuals also exist in such representations. Sometimes they are depicted as mysterious, frightening, and potentially dangerous individuals while in other sources, they are &quot;ridiculous&quot; characters &quot;to be made fun of, at times with unbridled cruelty&quot;. Folklore links to ghosts through their placation of wronged spirits and the chinkon ritual performance, accounts for their fearful quality. However, plays called feature deliberate tricking of a blind so that he becomes lost and disoriented, or suffers losses and misunderstanding. Such action is provoked by sighted individuals for pure amusement, as in the stories of Saru and Tsukimi . Picture scrolls marry this &quot;similar sense of as bizarre, somewhat frightening figures who can nevertheless be taunted&quot;. In these images, people &quot;look out from their houses at the players and appear to be laughing or jeering at them&quot;, while children run away from and dogs bark at them.

==Development of the style==
The present trend of scholarly analysis is to consider the &#x27;s origin as having arisen first as a recitation for the purpose of spreading Buddhism. According to the or &quot;Essays in Idleness&quot;, in the reign of the cloistered emperor Go-Toba, Yukinaga – the man in charge of the household of the chief advisor to the emperor, Fujiwara Kanezane – often exchanged poems with the imperial court. He was invited to an imperial discourse on poems, and unable to recall two of the seven virtues, was thus named the Jack of Five Virtues. Embarrassed, he gave up on learning poetry and took the tonsure, and became a monk under the abbot Jien of the Tendai sect. Jien was known to gather talent at the Shōren-in temple on Mount Hiei in Kyoto to discuss ways of spreading the Tendai faith. Many here were . It is in this way that Yukinaga legendarily wrote the script of the &quot;Tale of the&quot; , and taught it to a from eastern Japan named Shōbutsu, renowned for his impressive narrative delivery and extensive knowledge of warriors, bows, and horses.

According to George Gish, there were five essential ingredients for the development of the :

# Chinese popular sermons designed to appeal to the masses, known as 
# Epic ballad narration entitled , later revised into a new or Buddhist chant called the in reference to the six worlds of Buddhism, which became the chief model for the singing
# style of Buddhist preaching with melody, a style favored by Jien
# influence from the Kyoto- school from which idea of accompanying narration with derives
# The story itself chronicling the Taira/Genji Heian period, oft interpreted as one phase of Buddhism&#x27;s six worlds. The story is treated as a , or sermon with the purpose of enlightenment.

 musically is influenced by Buddhist chant, and the and traditions of the from the 11th and 12th centuries. Indeed, it is a combination of the style practiced by and , and narrative. Author Yukinaga brought elements of the court tradition, while Jien offered shomyo aspects. Shōbutsu as a Kyoto- and a brought unique perspectives as well.

The instrument itself is a combination of and predecessors. Indeed, the relative average distance between the frets is equal to that of , as are the relative height of the frets. From Shobutsu, two schools emerged, the Yasaka-ryū school, led by Jōgen, and Ichikata-ryū school, headed by Jōichi. Akashi Kakuichi was Jōichi&#x27;s disciple and a favorite of Ashikaga Takauji, possibly due to blood relations. Kakuichi soon gained the rank of , the head of guild for the blind, the Tōdō; he died in 1371 during the peak of the .

Musically, development continued with the Ichikata-ryū, with it spreading into four separate branches. During the Edo period, the main branches split further with the influence of the style. The main schools were Hatano-ryū and Maeda-ryū, named after their respective founders; intense rivalry between the schools, compounded by changes in the music world at large, contributed to the decline of the tradition.

The growing utilization of the by the mid-16th century precipitated new innovations in popular music. Some of the earliest innovations were carried out by players. They would use a -type plectrum on the to emulate the buzzing effect and sounds. The opportunities with the attracted others, and their patrons and listeners along with them. The new idiom of song made the old styles of antiquated, especially with the as a new instrument.

<doc id="631061" wikidata="Q841192" url="?curid=631061" title="Minstrel">
<text>A minstrel was an entertainer, initially in medieval Europe. The term originally described any type of entertainer such as a musician, juggler, acrobat, singer or fool; later, from the sixteenth century, it came to mean a specialist entertainer who sang songs and played musical instruments.

==Description==
Minstrels performed songs which told stories of distant places or of existing or imaginary historical events. Although minstrels created their own tales, often they would memorize and embellish the works of others. Frequently they were retained by royalty and high society. As the courts became more sophisticated, minstrels were eventually replaced at court by the troubadours, and many became wandering minstrels, performing in the streets; a decline in their popularity began in the late 15th century. Minstrels fed into later traditions of travelling entertainers, which continued to be moderately strong into the early 20th century, and which has some continuity in the form of today&#x27;s buskers or street musicians.

Initially, minstrels were simply treats at court, and entertained the lord and courtiers with &quot;chansons de geste&quot; or their local equivalent. The term &quot;minstrel&quot; derives from Old French &quot;ménestrel&quot; (also &quot;menesterel, menestral&quot;), which is a derivative from Italian &quot;ministrello&quot; (later &quot;menestrello&quot;), from Middle Latin &quot;ministralis&quot; &quot;retainer&quot;, an adjective form of Latin &quot;minister&quot;, &quot;attendant&quot; from &quot;minus&quot;, &quot;lesser&quot;.

In Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman Conquest, the professional poet was known as a &quot;scop&quot; (&quot;shaper&quot; or &quot;maker&quot;), who composed his own poems, and sang them to the accompaniment of a harp. In a rank much beneath the &quot;scop&quot; were the &quot;gleemen&quot;, who had no settled abode, but roamed about from place to place, earning what they could from their performances. Late in the 13th century, the term &quot;minstrel&quot; began to be used to designate a performer who amused his lord with music and song. Following a series of invasions, wars, conquests, etc., two categories of composers developed. Poets like Chaucer and John Gower appeared in one category, wherein music was not a part. Minstrels, on the other hand, gathered at feasts and festivals in great numbers with harps, fiddles, bagpipes, flutes, flageolets, citterns and kettledrums. Additionally, minstrels were known for their involvement in political commentary and engaged in propaganda. They often reported news with bias to sway opinion and revised works to encourage action in favor of equality. The &quot;Heege Manuscript&quot;, transcribed in the English Midlands around 1480 by Richard Heege, may offer a sample of the humor favored by some medieval minstrels at festivals.

The music of the troubadours and trouvères was performed by minstrels called &quot;joglars&quot; (Occitan) or &quot;jongleurs&quot; (French). As early as 1321, the minstrels of Paris were formed into a guild. A guild of royal minstrels was organized in England in 1469. Minstrels were required to either join the guild or abstain from practising their craft. Some minstrels were retained by lords as jesters who, in some cases, also practised the art of juggling. Some were women or women who followed minstrels in their travels. Minstrels throughout Europe also employed trained animals, such as bears. Minstrels in Europe died out slowly, having gone nearly extinct by about 1700, although isolated individuals working in the tradition existed even into the early 19th century.

==In literature==
Minstrelsy became a central concern in English literature in the Romantic period and has remained so intermittently.

In poetry, &quot;The Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot; (1805) by Sir Walter Scott, &quot;Lalla Rookh&quot; (1817) by Thomas Moore, and &quot;The Village Minstrel&quot; (1821) by John Clare were three of many. Novels centring on minstrelsy have included Helen Craik&#x27;s &quot;Henry of Northumberland&quot; (1800), Sydney Owenson&#x27;s &quot;The Novice of St Dominick&#x27;s&quot; (a girl using a minstrel disguise, 1805), Christabel Rose Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Minstrel Dick&quot; (a choirboy turned minstrel becomes a courtier, 1891), Rhoda Power&#x27;s &quot;Redcap Runs Away&quot; (a boy of ten joins wandering minstrels, 1952), and A. J. Cronin&#x27;s &quot;The Minstrel Boy&quot; (priesthood to minstrelsy and back, 1975).

<doc id="631063" wikidata="Q1320561" url="?curid=631063" title="Key management">
<text>Key management refers to management of cryptographic keys in a cryptosystem. This includes dealing with the generation, exchange, storage, use, crypto-shredding (destruction) and replacement of keys. It includes cryptographic protocol design, key servers, user procedures, and other relevant protocols.

Key management concerns keys at the user level, either between users or systems. This is in contrast to key scheduling, which typically refers to the internal handling of keys within the operation of a cipher.

Successful key management is critical to the security of a cryptosystem. It is the more challenging side of cryptography in a sense that it involves aspects of social engineering such as system policy, user training, organizational and departmental interactions, and coordination between all of these elements, in contrast to pure mathematical practices that can be automated.

==Types of keys==

Cryptographic systems may use different types of keys, with some systems using more than one. These may include symmetric keys or asymmetric keys. In a symmetric key algorithm the keys involved are identical for both encrypting and decrypting a message. Keys must be chosen carefully, and distributed and stored securely. Asymmetric keys, also known as public keys, in contrast are two distinct keys that are mathematically linked. They are typically used together to communicate. Public key infrastructure (PKI), the implementation of public key cryptography, requires an organization to establish an infrastructure to create and manage public and private key pairs along with digital certificates.

==Inventory==

The starting point in any certificate and private key management strategy is to create a comprehensive inventory of all certificates, their locations and responsible parties. This is not a trivial matter because certificates from a variety of sources are deployed in a variety of locations by different individuals and teams - it&#x27;s simply not possible to rely on a list from a single certificate authority. Certificates that are not renewed and replaced before they expire can cause serious downtime and outages. Some other considerations:
*Regulations and requirements, like PCI-DSS, demand stringent security and management of cryptographic keys and auditors are increasingly reviewing the management controls and processes in use.
*Private keys used with certificates must be kept secure or unauthorised individuals can intercept confidential communications or gain unauthorised access to critical systems. Failure to ensure proper segregation of duties means that admins who generate the encryption keys can use them to access sensitive, regulated data.
*If a certificate authority is compromised or an encryption algorithm is broken, organizations must be prepared to replace all of their certificates and keys in a matter of hours.

==Management steps==
Once keys are inventoried, key management typically consists of three steps: exchange, storage and use.

===Key exchange===

Prior to any secured communication, users must set up the details of the cryptography. In some instances this may require exchanging identical keys (in the case of a symmetric key system). In others it may require possessing the other party&#x27;s public key. While public keys can be openly exchanged (their corresponding private key is kept secret), symmetric keys must be exchanged over a secure communication channel. Formerly, exchange of such a key was extremely troublesome, and was greatly eased by access to secure channels such as a diplomatic bag. Clear text exchange of symmetric keys would enable any interceptor to immediately learn the key, and any encrypted data.

The advance of public key cryptography in the 1970s has made the exchange of keys less troublesome. Since the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol was published in 1975, it has become possible to exchange a key over an insecure communications channel, which has substantially reduced the risk of key disclosure during distribution. It is possible, using something akin to a book code, to include key indicators as clear text attached to an encrypted message. The encryption technique used by Richard Sorge&#x27;s code clerk was of this type, referring to a page in a statistical manual, though it was in fact a code. The German Army Enigma symmetric encryption key was a mixed type early in its use; the key was a combination of secretly distributed key schedules and a user chosen session key component for each message.

In more modern systems, such as OpenPGP compatible systems, a session key for a symmetric key algorithm is distributed encrypted by an asymmetric key algorithm. This approach avoids even the necessity for using a key exchange protocol like Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

Another method of key exchange involves encapsulating one key within another. Typically a master key is generated and exchanged using some secure method. This method is usually cumbersome or expensive (breaking a master key into multiple parts and sending each with a trusted courier for example) and not suitable for use on a larger scale. Once the master key has been securely exchanged, it can then be used to securely exchange subsequent keys with ease. This technique is usually termed key wrap. A common technique uses block ciphers and cryptographic hash functions.

A related method is to exchange a master key (sometimes termed a root key) and derive subsidiary keys as needed from that key and some other data (often referred to as diversification data). The most common use for this method is probably in smartcard-based cryptosystems, such as those found in banking cards. The bank or credit network embeds their secret key into the card&#x27;s secure key storage during card production at a secured production facility. Then at the point of sale the card and card reader are both able to derive a common set of session keys based on the shared secret key and card-specific data (such as the card serial number). This method can also be used when keys must be related to each other (i.e., departmental keys are tied to divisional keys, and individual keys tied to departmental keys). However, tying keys to each other in this way increases the damage which may result from a security breach as attackers will learn something about more than one key. This reduces entropy, with regard to an attacker, for each key involved.

A recent method uses an oblivious pseudorandom function to issue keys without the key management system ever being in a position to see the keys.

===Key storage===
However distributed, keys must be stored securely to maintain communications security. Security is a big concern and hence there are various techniques in use to do so. Likely the most common is that an encryption application manages keys for the user and depends on an access password to control use of the key. Likewise, in the case of smartphone keyless access platforms, they keep all identifying door information off mobile phones and servers and encrypt all data, where just like low-tech keys, users give codes only to those they trust.

In terms of regulation, there are few that address key storage in depth. &quot;Some contain minimal guidance like &#x27;don’t store keys with encrypted data&#x27; or suggest that &#x27;keys should be kept securely.&#x27;&quot; The notable exceptions to that are PCI DSS 3.2.1, NIST 800-53 and NIST 800–57.

For optimal security, keys may be stored in a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or protected using technologies such as Trusted Execution Environment (TEE, e.g. Intel SGX) or Multi-Party Computation (MPC). Additional alternatives include utilizing Trusted Platform Modules (TPM), virtual HSMs, aka &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Hardware Security Modules&quot; (pmHSM), or non-volatile Field-Programmable-Gate-Arrays (FPGA) with supporting System-on-Chip configurations. In order to verify the integrity of a key stored without compromising its actual value a KCV algorithm can be used.

===Key encryption use===
The major issue is length of time a key is to be used, and therefore frequency of replacement. Because it increases any attacker&#x27;s required effort, keys should be frequently changed. This also limits loss of information, as the number of stored encrypted messages which will become readable when a key is found will decrease as the frequency of key change increases. Historically, symmetric keys have been used for long periods in situations in which key exchange was very difficult or only possible intermittently. Ideally, the symmetric key should change with each message or interaction, so that only that message will become readable if the key is learned (&quot;e.g.&quot;, stolen, cryptanalyzed, or social engineered).

==Challenges==
Several challenges IT organizations face when trying to control and manage their encryption keys are:
# Scalability: Managing a large number of encryption keys.
# Security: Vulnerability of keys from outside hackers, malicious insiders.
# Availability: Ensuring data accessibility for authorized users.
# Heterogeneity: Supporting multiple databases, applications and standards.
# Governance: Defining policy-driven access control and protection for data. Governance includes compliance with data protection requirements.

==Compliance==
Key management compliance refers to the oversight, assurance, and capability of being able to demonstrate that keys are securely managed. This includes the following individual compliance domains:

* &quot;Physical security&quot; – the most visible form of compliance, which may include locked doors to secure system equipment and surveillance cameras. These safeguards can prevent unauthorized access to printed copies of key material and computer systems that run key management software.
* &quot;Logical security&quot; – protects the organization against the theft or unauthorized access of information. This is where the use of cryptographic keys comes in by encrypting data, which is then rendered useless to those who do not have the key to decrypt it.
* &quot;Personnel security&quot; – this involves assigning specific roles or privileges to personnel to access information on a strict need-to-know basis. Background checks should be performed on new employees along with periodic role changes to ensure security.

Compliance can be achieved with respect to national and international data protection standards and regulations, such as Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Sarbanes–Oxley Act, or General Data Protection Regulation.

==Management and compliance systems==

===Key management system===
A &quot;key management system&quot; (KMS), also known as a &quot;cryptographic key management system&quot; (CKMS) or &quot;enterprise key management system&quot; (EKMS), is an integrated approach for generating, distributing and managing cryptographic keys for devices and applications. They may cover all aspects of security - from the secure generation of keys over the secure exchange of keys up to secure key handling and storage on the client. Thus, a KMS includes the backend functionality for key generation, distribution, and replacement as well as the client functionality for injecting keys, storing and managing keys on devices.

===Standards-based key management===

Many specific applications have developed their own key management systems with home grown protocols. However, as systems become more interconnected keys need to be shared between those different systems. To facilitate this, key management standards have evolved to define the protocols used to manage and exchange cryptographic keys and related information.

===Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP)===
KMIP is an extensible key management protocol that has been developed by many organizations working within the OASIS standards body. The first version was released in 2010, and it has been further developed by an active technical committee.

The protocol allows for the creation of keys and their distribution among disparate software systems that need to utilize them. It covers the full key life cycle of both symmetric and asymmetric keys in a variety of formats, the wrapping of keys, provisioning schemes, and cryptographic operations as well as meta data associated with the keys.

The protocol is backed by an extensive series of test cases, and interoperability testing is performed between compliant systems each year.

A list of some 80 products that conform to the KMIP standard can be found on the OASIS website.

As defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST, the policy shall establish and specify rules for this information that will protect its:
* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Availability
* Authentication of source

This protection covers the complete key life-cycle from the time the key becomes operational to its elimination.

====Bring your own encryption / key====

&quot;Bring your own encryption&quot; (BYOE)—also called &quot;bring your own key&quot; (BYOK)—refers to a cloud-computing security model to allow public-cloud customers to use their own encryption software and manage their own encryption keys.
This security model is usually considered a marketing stunt, as critical keys are being handed over to third parties (cloud providers) and key owners are still left with the operational burden of generating, rotating and sharing their keys.

===Public-key infrastructure (PKI)===

A public-key infrastructure is a type of key management system that uses hierarchical digital certificates to provide authentication, and public keys to provide encryption. PKIs are used in World Wide Web traffic, commonly in the form of SSL and TLS.

===Multicast group key management===
Group key management means managing the keys in a group communication. Most of the group communications use multicast communication so that if the message is sent once by the sender, it will be received by all the users. The main problem in multicast group communication is its security. In order to improve the security, various keys are given to the users. Using the keys, the users can encrypt their messages and send them secretly. IETF.org released RFC 4046, entitled Multicast Security (MSEC) Group Key Management Architecture, which discusses the challenges of group key management.

<doc id="631064" wikidata="Q3554703" url="?curid=631064" title="Vardis">
<text>Vardis are an English three-piece hard rock, boogie rock and heavy metal band from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, who enjoyed hits between 1978 and 1986, and reformed in 2014.

They formed a prominent part of the new wave of British heavy metal scene, then prevalent in the United Kingdom. They consisted of frontman Steve Zodiac (real name Stephen John Hepworth) on guitar and lead vocals Alan Selway on bass guitar and Gary Pearson on drums. Alan Selway was later replaced by Terry Horbury (previously of Dirty Tricks) on bass guitar.

==Background==
The band were originally formed in 1973 under the name &#x27;Quo Vardis&#x27; (a misspelling of the Latin for &#x27;quo vadis&#x27;, or &#x27;whither goest thou?&#x27;). This was later abbreviated to Vardis in 1977. Their first recordings were made at Holyground Studios in Cass Yard, Kirgate, Wakefield. The first ever track laid down on vinyl was titled &quot;Jiving All Night Long&quot; with the B-side titled &quot;Stay with Me&quot;, both penned by Zodiac. This was followed up with a second record, both cover versions, those being &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; (Chuck Berry) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Waste My Time&quot; (Status Quo).

Vardis quickly gained notoriety for their high energy live performances, the unique approach of incorporating elements of 1970s glam rock and heavy metal music and frontman Steve Zodiac&#x27;s searing Fender Telecaster sound. Zodiac was reputable for playing Vardis concerts barefoot and bare chested, his look completed by long, naturally ice-blonde hair.

They took the unorthodox approach of comprising their debut album, &quot;100MPH&quot; (1980), of entirely live recordings. This is largely considered to be their finest hour and gained the band a large following early on in their career. They were invited to play the Heavy Metal Holocaust music festival in August 1981 alongside Motörhead, Ozzy Osbourne and Triumph. Around 30,000 heavy metal fans were estimated to have attended with the PA reportedly reaching new heights of amplification at over 100,000 watts.

Their second album, released in April 1981 and called &quot;The World&#x27;s Insane&quot;, featured a cover version of Hawkwind&#x27;s &quot;Silver Machine&quot;, and featured bagpipes played by Judd Lander, making it one of the few heavy metal albums of that time to ever feature bagpipes. The album also featured a guest appearances from Status Quo&#x27;s Andy Bown on keyboards. In 1982, Steve Zodiac was voted in the top 15 rock guitarists by &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine readers.

Vardis dissolved in the mid 1980s amid lengthy legal disputes with former management.

Vardis reformed with the Zodiac/Horbury/Pearson lineup in March 2014, and performed at festivals in the UK and Germany until Gary Pearson&#x27;s departure at the end of the year, with Hoplite Records reissuing a remastered edition of &quot;Vigilante&quot; (1986) on CD and digital download for the first time on 1 April. New drummer Joe Clancy was unveiled in January 2015, as Vardis announced plans to write and record new material. This new lineup released the EP &quot;200 MPH&quot; on 18 July, the first new Vardis material in 29 years, to critical acclaim. In November 2015, Vardis penned a worldwide deal with SPV/Steamhammer, with the German label announcing the fifth Vardis album, &quot;Red Eye&quot;, had been scheduled for release in 2016. On 15 December that year, bassist Terry Horbury died suddenly after a short battle with cancer. Bassist Martin Connolly stepped in to fulfil live obligations in support of &quot;Red Eye&quot; the following year. Roly Bailey was unveiled as the new permanent bassist in September 2019.

<text>Guarapari is a coastal town of Espírito Santo, Brazil, a popular tourist destination. Its beach is famous for the high natural radioactivity level of its sand.

==Geography==
===Location===
Guarapari is a part of Greater Vitoria, 47 km south of the state capital Vitória. Its population is 126,701 (2020) and its area is 592 km2.
It is a well-known tourist destination, known for its curving white sand beaches backed by commercial development, which extend southward to Nova Guarapari and Meaípe. With its heavily built-up coastline like Vila Velha and Vitória, it caters heavily to seasonal tourists, and consequently has quite a dramatic seasonal population fluctuation.

The municipality contains the Concha d&#x27;Ostra Sustainable Development Reserve, established in 2003 to protect the mangroves of the Bay of Guarapari. It also contains the Paulo César Vinha State Park, which protects an area of dunes, lagoons and marshes along the Atlantic shore. Formerly called the Setiba nature reserve, it is a pristine example of a coastal ecosystem and important for local turtle and bird populations.

==History==
The municipality has had European presence since 1585 when Jesuit missionaries built a small chapel and dug a well.

==Transportation==
The city is served by Guarapari Airport.

==Radioactivity==

Along a roughly 500-mile (800 km) portion of Brazil&#x27;s Atlantic coast that runs from north of Rio de Janeiro up to the region south of Bahia, the sands of old beaches are naturally radioactive. Sea waves pound coastal mountains rich in monazite, a phosphate of rare earth metals containing uranium and thorium. The background radiation level on some spots on the Guarapari beach read 175 mSv per year (20μSv/h); Some other spots can reach dosages of up to 55 μSv/h. The average exposure level across the United States is 0.34 μSv/h while a chest x-ray is a one time exposure of 0.1 mSv, and an abdominal and pelvic CT scan with and without contrast is 20-30 mSv.

In the Guarapari city, radiation levels are far lower: a study among 320 inhabitants showed an average received dose of 0.6 μSv/h, corresponding to 5.2 mSv per year.

<doc id="631068" wikidata="Q221716" url="?curid=631068" title="Kiyomizu-dera">
<text>is a Buddhist temple located in eastern Kyoto, Japan. The temple is part of the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== History ==

The temple was established in 778, during the late Nara period, by Enchin Shonin, who was a priest from Nara (the capital of Japan from 710 to 784). He is said to have received a vision telling him to construct the temple next to the Otowa spring.

In 798, the shogun Sakanoue Tamuramaro improved the site by including a large hall that was reassembled from the palace of Emperor Kammu (r. 781–806). The emperor had left Nara to escape the strong influence that the Buddhist monasteries had on the government there. During this period there was a strong rivalry between the Kofuku-ji and the Kiyomizu-dera temples, and both had influence around the region.

Many of the temple&#x27;s present buildings were constructed in 1633 on the orders of the shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu. There is not a single nail used in the entire structure. It takes its name from the waterfall within the complex, which runs off the nearby hills. &quot;Kiyomizu&quot; means &quot;pure water&quot;.

It was originally affiliated with the old and influential Hossō sect, dating from Nara times. However, in 1965 it severed that affiliation, and its present custodians call themselves members of their own Kita-Hossō (Northern Hossō) sect.

=== Present ===

The expression &quot;to jump off the stage at Kiyomizu&quot; is the Japanese equivalent of the English expression &quot;to take the plunge&quot;. This refers to an Edo-period tradition that held that if one survived a jump from the stage, one&#x27;s wish would be granted. During the Edo period, 234 jumps were recorded, and of the jumpers, 85.4 per cent survived. The practice was prohibited in 1872.

The temple complex includes several other shrines, among them the Jishu Shrine, dedicated to Ōkuninushi, a god of love and &quot;good matches&quot;. Jishu Shrine possesses a pair of &quot;love stones&quot; placed apart, which lonely visitors can try to walk between with their eyes closed. Success in reaching the other stone with their eyes closed implies that the pilgrim will find true love.

The complex also offers various talismans, incense, and &quot;omikuji&quot; (paper fortunes). The site is particularly popular during festivals, especially at New Year&#x27;s and during &quot;obon&quot; in the summer, when additional booths fill the grounds selling traditional holiday foodstuffs and souvenirs.

In 2007, Kiyomizu-dera was one of 21 finalists for the New Seven Wonders of the World, but was not picked as one of the seven winning sites. The temple was covered entirely by semi-transparent scaffolding while it underwent restoration works in preparation for the 2020 Olympics.

== Architecture ==
Kiyomizu-dera is located in the foothills of Mount Otowa, part of the Higashiyama mountain range that dominates eastern Kyoto. The main hall has a large veranda, supported by tall pillars using , that juts out over the hillside and offers views of the city. Large verandas and main halls were constructed at many popular sites during the Edo period to accommodate large numbers of pilgrims.

Beneath the main hall is the Otowa waterfall, where three channels of water fall into a pond. Visitors can catch and drink the water, which is believed to have wish-granting powers. There is also the Tainai Meguri, a dark tunnel said to represent the womb of Daizuiku Bosatsu (the bodhisattva Mahāpratisarā).

<text>Alain J. Maury (born 1958) is a French astronomer who has discovered numerous asteroids.

He discovered the periodic comet 115P/Maury as well as the non-periodic C/1988 C1 (Maury-Phinney).

He has discovered a number of asteroids, including the Apollo asteroid 3838 Epona and the Amor asteroids 11284 Belenus and 5370 Taranis.

He participated in the OCA DLR Asteroid Survey (ODAS), which also discovered more than 2200 asteroids during its 30-month lifetime.

The asteroid 3780 Maury was named in his honour.

Since 2003, Maury and his wife Alejandra have operated their own observatory near San Pedro de Atacama in Northern Chile. There, they give tours introducing visitors to the night sky in order to finance their own research and further public interest in astronomy.

<doc id="631072" wikidata="Q2264270" url="?curid=631072" title="Invincible-class battlecruiser">
<text>The three &quot;Invincible&quot;-class battlecruisers were built for the Royal Navy and entered service in 1908 as the world&#x27;s first battlecruisers. They were the brainchild of Admiral Sir John (&quot;Jacky&quot;) Fisher, the man who had sponsored the construction of the world&#x27;s first &quot;all-big-gun&quot; warship, . He visualised a new breed of warship, somewhere between the armoured cruiser and battleship; it would have the armament of the latter, but the high speed of the former. This combination would allow it to chase down most ships, while allowing it to run from more powerful designs.

This design philosophy would prove to be most successful when the &quot;Invincible&quot;s were able to use their speed to run down smaller and weaker ships. The classic example was during World War I at the Battle of the Falkland Islands, where and sank the German armoured cruisers and ; despite numerous hits by the German ships, &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Invincible&quot; incurred very few casualties among their crews. They were least successful when standing in the main line of battle, where they faced enemy capital ships. An example is the loss of &quot;Invincible&quot; to a magazine explosion during the Battle of Jutland about eighteen months after her success in the Falklands, although this explosion owed more to flaws in British ammunition-handling practices – that exposed numerous cordite charges to a fire in one of her gun turrets – than any flaws in the design of the ship.

After the loss of &quot;Invincible&quot;, the two surviving ships had an uneventful time for the rest of the war conducting patrols of the North Sea, as the High Seas Fleet was forbidden to risk any more losses. They were put into reserve in early 1919 and sold for scrap in 1921.

==Design==
After Admiral Fisher was appointed First Sea Lord on 20 October 1904, he pushed through the Board of Admiralty in early December 1904 a decision to arm the next armoured cruiser with guns and that it would have a speed no less than . Shortly afterwards he convened a &quot;Committee on Designs&quot; to investigate and report on requirements for future ships. While nominally independent, it served to validate decisions already made and to deflect criticism off Fisher and the Board of Admiralty, as it had no ability to consider options other than those already decided upon by the Admiralty. Fisher appointed all of the members of the Committee and himself as President of the Committee. During its last meeting on the 22 of February 1905 it decided on the outline design of the fast armoured cruiser. This, in turn, was approved by the Board on March the 16th with only minor changes, such as the reduction in the anti-torpedo boat armament from twenty to eighteen 12-pdr guns.

===General characteristics===
The &quot;Invincible&quot;-class ships were formally known as armoured cruisers until 1911, when they were redesignated as battlecruisers by an Admiralty order of 24 November. Unofficially a number of designations were used until then, including cruiser-battleship, dreadnought cruiser and battle-cruiser.

The &quot;Invincible&quot;s were significantly larger than their armoured cruiser predecessors of the . They had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of at deep load. They displaced at load and at deep load, nearly more than the earlier ships.

===Propulsion===
Early in the design process the &quot;Committee on Designs&quot; had thought to power these ships with the traditional reciprocating vertical triple-expansion steam engines, but were persuaded to adopt Parsons steam turbines as they required fewer boilers for the same amount of power, were easier to protect from damage as they were more compact than reciprocating engines and could be kept below the waterline. In addition they were significantly lighter and more reliable than the older design. The direct-drive turbines then in use did have one significant drawback in that they ran at a relatively high speed which required small-diameter, fine-pitch propellers of a large blade area which adversely affected manoeuvrability at low speeds. Parsons alleviated this problem by his suggestion of fitting more powerful astern turbines on all four shafts, which could increase manoeuvrability by reversing the turbines as needed.

An additional solution was to fit twin balanced rudders behind each inner shaft, in contrast to the single central rudder used on earlier ships. This greatly increased the effectiveness of the rudder and substantially decreased the turning circle of the &quot;Invincible&quot;s in comparison to earlier ships of their size.

The &quot;Invincible&quot;s had two paired sets of Parsons turbines housed in separate engine-rooms. Each set consisted of a high-pressure ahead and astern turbine driving an outboard shaft, and a low-pressure ahead and astern turbine driving an inner shaft. A cruising turbine was also coupled to each inner shaft, although these were not used often and were eventually disconnected. Each shaft drove a propeller in diameter. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , but reached nearly during trials in 1908. Designed speed was , but all three bettered during trials. maintained an average speed of for three days during a passage of the North Atlantic in August 1908.

The steam plant consisted of 31 Yarrow (&quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Inflexible&quot;) or Babcock &amp; Wilcox (&quot;Indomitable&quot;) large-tube boilers, arranged in four boiler rooms. Maximum bunkerage was approximately of coal, with an additional of fuel oil to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full fuel capacity, the ships could steam for at a speed of .

===Armament===

Each carried eight BL 12-inch (305 mm) Mk X guns in four hydraulically powered BVIII twin turrets, except for &quot;Invincible&quot; which mounted her guns in two BIX and two BX electrically driven turrets. Two turrets were mounted fore and aft on the centreline, identified as &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; respectively. Two turrets were mounted amidships between the second and third funnels, identified as &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27;. &#x27;P&#x27; turret was mounted on the port side and normally faced forward, &#x27;Q&#x27; turret was mounted on the starboard side and normally faced aft (rearwards). &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turrets were staggered—&#x27;P&#x27; was forward of &#x27;Q&#x27;, enabling &#x27;P&#x27; to fire in a limited arc to the starboard side and &#x27;Q&#x27; to likewise fire in a limited arc towards the port side. These were the same guns as those mounted in the British , the and the , and for a brief period the &quot;Invincible&quot;s equalled the firepower of any other nations&#x27; battleships.

The guns could initially be depressed to −3° and elevated to 13.5°, although the turrets were modified to allow 16° of elevation during World War I. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 13.5°, this provided a maximum range of with armour-piercing (AP) 2 crh shells. At 16° elevation, the range was extended to using the more aerodynamic, but slightly heavier 4 crh AP shells. The rate of fire of these guns was 1–2 rounds per minute. The ships had a total of 880 rounds during wartime for 110 shells per gun.

The ships&#x27; secondary armament initially was intended to consist of eighteen 12-pdr guns, but firing trials against the old destroyer in 1906 showed that the 12-pdr gun had little chance of stopping a destroyer or torpedo boat before it got close enough to fire its torpedoes.
The originally intended 12-pounder guns were exchanged for sixteen 4-in (102 mm) QF Mk III guns early in the construction process. They were positioned in the superstructure and on turret roofs in open mounts as they were not expected to be manned in a ship-to-ship engagement during daylight. During 1914–15 the turret roof guns were transferred to the superstructure and the total number of guns was reduced to twelve. All of the remaining guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields at that time to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.

The guns on their PI* mounts had a maximum depression of 10° and a maximum elevation of 20°. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 20°, this provided a maximum range of using Common pointed shells. Their rate of fire was 8–10 rounds per minute.

These guns were replaced by twelve 4-inch BL MK IX guns on CPI mountings on &quot;Inflexible&quot; during 1917. They could depress 10° and elevate to 30°. They fired shells at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum range of at a rate of fire of 10–12 rounds per minute.

The QF Mk III guns were replaced by twelve 4-inch BL MK VII guns on PVI mountings on &quot;Indomitable&quot; during 1917. These guns could depress 7° and elevate to 15°. They fired shells at a muzzle velocity of which gave a maximum range of . Their rate of fire was 6–8 rounds per minute. An additional gun was fitted on &quot;Indomitable&quot; in April 1917 as an anti-aircraft (AA) gun. It was mounted on a MK II high-angle mounting with a maximum elevation of 60°. It had a reduced propellant charge with a muzzle velocity of only .

Earlier anti-aircraft guns included a 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun on a high-angle Mk Ic mounting with a maximum elevation of 60°. Both &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; carried theirs from November 1914 to August 1917. It fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 20 rounds per minute. This provided a maximum range of at 45°, but the maximum effective anti-aircraft range was only .

Each of the &quot;Invincible&quot;s was also fitted with a single QF 3-inch 20 cwt AA gun on a high-angle MKII mount at the aft end of the superstructure. This had a maximum depression of 10° and a maximum elevation of 90°. It fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 12–14 rounds per minute. They had a maximum effective ceiling of .

Gardiner and Gray quote an additional seven Maxim guns, but this cannot be confirmed. Five 18-inch (450 mm) submerged torpedo tubes were mounted on the &quot;Invincible&quot;s, two on each side and one in the stern and fourteen torpedoes were carried.

===Fire control===
The spotting tops at the head of the fore and main masts controlled the fire of the &quot;Invincible&quot;s&#x27; main guns. Data from a Barr and Stroud rangefinder was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the Transmitting Station located beneath each spotting top where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target&#x27;s data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. Each gun turret had its own transmission equipment and the turrets, Transmitting Stations, and spotting tops could be connected in almost any combination. Firing trials against in 1907 revealed this system&#x27;s vulnerability to gunfire as the spotting top was hit twice and a large splinter severed the voice pipe and all wiring running along the mast. To guard against this possibility, &#x27;A&#x27; turret was fitted, during refits between 1911 and 1914, with a 9-foot rangefinder at the rear of the turret roof and it was equipped to control the entire main armament.

Fire control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding World War I and the development of the Dreyer Fire Control Table was one such advance. It combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock and a simplified version, the Mk I, was fitted to the &quot;Invincible&quot;s during refits in 1915–16. The more important development was the director firing system. This consisted of a fire control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided gun data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director officer fired the guns simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. &quot;Invincible&quot; was the first battlecruiser to receive this system during her refit from April to August 1914, but its installation was interrupted by the outbreak of the war and it was not fully working until after the Battle of the Falkland Islands in November. &quot;Indomitable&quot; and &quot;Inflexible&quot; didn&#x27;t receive their systems until May 1916, immediately before the Battle of Jutland.

===Protection===
The armour protection given to the &quot;Invincible&quot;s the waterline belt measured amidships was only slightly more than half the thickness of &#x27;s . The belt was six inches thick roughly between the fore and aft twelve-inch gun turrets, but was reduced to four inches from the fore turret to the bow and did not extend aft of the rear turret. A six-inch bulkhead met the barbette of X turret to fully enclose the armoured citadel. The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by of armour, except for the turret roofs which used of Krupp non-cemented armour (KNC). The thickness of the main deck was around the base of barbettes and the crown of the base of the rear conning tower. It was over the crown of the base of the forward conning tower. The lower deck armour was on the flat and two inches thick on the slope, except aft of the rear turret where it was increased to to protect the steering gear. The front and sides of the forward conning tower were thick while its rear was . The walls of the rear conning tower were six inches thick. The roof and floor of both conning towers were KNC armour 2 inches thick while their communication tubes were of KNC. The signal tower immediately aft of the forward conning tower also had three inches of KNC. Mild steel torpedo bulkheads of 2.5-inch thickness were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms. Krupp cemented armour was used throughout, unless otherwise mentioned.

===Aircraft===
By 1918 the two surviving &quot;Invincible&quot;s carried a Sopwith Pup and a Sopwith 1½ Strutter on flying-off ramps fitted on top of &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turrets. Each platform had a canvas hangar to protect the aircraft during inclement weather.

==Ships==
The three &quot;Invincible&quot;s were ordered at the same time as &quot;Dreadnought&quot; as part of the 1905–06 Naval Programme. The following table gives the build details and purchase cost of the members of the &quot;Invincible&quot; class. Whilst standard British practice at that time was for these costs to exclude armament and stores, for some reason the cost quoted in The Naval Annual for this class &quot;includes&quot; armament.
==Service history==
All three ships entered service from the second half of 1908. Initially, &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Inflexible&quot; were assigned to the Home Fleet, while &quot;Indomitable&quot; took the Prince of Wales (later King George V) to the tercentennial celebrations in Canada, before also joining the Home Fleet. &quot;Invincible&quot;″s electrically driven turrets proved to be a failure despite two lengthy refits in 1909 and 1911 and were converted to hydraulic power during her refit in early 1914 at the enormous cost of £151,200. The situation was so bad during her gunnery trials in October 1908 that the captain of , the Royal Navy&#x27;s gunnery school described their operation thusly: &quot;When the order was given to train the turret, elevate or run a gun in or out, it was only necessary to push a button, or move a switch, but the result was often a flash of blue flame which seemed to fill the turret.&quot;

In 1914, &quot;Invincible&quot; was refitting in England, while &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot;, together with the newer formed the nucleus of the Mediterranean Fleet, where &quot;Inflexible&quot; served as flagship from November 1912. It was in the Mediterranean that the first naval action of the First World War took place, when the British pursued the German warships and upon the outbreak of war.

===World War I===
====Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau====

&quot;Indomitable&quot;, accompanied by &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, under the command of Admiral Sir Archibald Berkeley Milne encountered the battlecruiser &quot;Goeben&quot; and the light cruiser &quot;Breslau&quot; on the morning of 4 August 1914 headed east after a cursory bombardment of the French Algerian port of Philippeville, but Britain and Germany were not yet at war so Milne turned to shadow the Germans as they headed back to Messina to recoal. All three battlecruisers had problems with their boilers, but &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot; were able to break contact and reached Messina by the morning of the 5th. By this time war had been declared, after the German invasion of Belgium, but an Admiralty order to respect Italian neutrality and stay outside a six-mile (10 km) limit from the Italian coast precluded entrance into the passage of the Strait of Messina where they could observe the port directly. Therefore, Milne stationed &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Indefatigable&quot; at the northern exit of the Straits of Messina, still expecting the Germans to break out to the west where they could attack French troop transports, the light cruiser at the southern exit and sent &quot;Indomitable&quot; to recoal at Bizerte where she was better positioned to react to a German sortie into the Western Mediterranean.

The Germans sortied from Messina on 6 August and headed east, towards Constantinople, trailed by &quot;Gloucester&quot;. Milne, still expecting Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon to turn west, kept the battlecruisers at Malta until shortly after midnight on 8 August when he set sail for Cape Matapan at a leisurely , where Goeben had been spotted eight hours earlier. At 2:30 p.m. he received an incorrect signal from the Admiralty stating that Britain was at war with Austria – war would not be declared until 12 August and the order was countermanded four hours later, but Milne followed his standing orders to guard the Adriatic against an Austrian break-out attempt, rather than seek &quot;Goeben&quot;. Finally on 9 August Milne was given clear orders to &quot;chase &quot;Goeben&quot; which had passed Cape Matapan on the 7th steering north-east.&quot; Milne still did not believe that Souchon was heading for the Dardanelles, and so he resolved to guard the exit from the Aegean, unaware that the &quot;Goeben&quot; did not intend to come out. &quot;Indomitable&quot; remained in the Mediterranean to blockade the Dardanelles, but &quot;Inflexible&quot; was ordered home on 18 August.

On 3 November 1914, Churchill ordered the first British attack on the Dardanelles following the opening of hostilities between Turkey and Russia. The attack was carried out by &quot;Indomitable&quot; and &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, as well as the French pre-dreadnought battleships and . The intention of the attack was to test the fortifications and measure the Turkish response. The results were deceptively encouraging. In a twenty-minute bombardment, a single shell struck the magazine of the fort at Sedd el Bahr at the tip of the Gallipoli peninsula, displacing (but not destroying) 10 guns and killing 86 Turkish soldiers. The most significant consequence was that the attention of the Turks was drawn to strengthening their defences, and they set about expanding the mine field. This attack actually took place before a formal declaration of war had been made by Britain against the Ottoman Empire which happened on 6 November. &quot;Indomitable&quot; was ordered to return to England in December where she joined the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS).

====Battle of Heligoland Bight====

&quot;Invincible&quot;″s first action was as part of the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral Beatty during the Battle of Heligoland Bight operation on 28 August 1914. Beatty&#x27;s ships had originally been intended as distant support of the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast in case large units of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks. They turned south at full speed at 11:35 when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule and the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the bar at the mouth of the Jade estuary. The brand-new light cruiser had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the light cruisers and when Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12:37. &quot;Strassburg&quot; was able to duck into the mists and evade fire, but &quot;Cöln&quot; remained visible and was quickly crippled by fire from the squadron. But Beatty was distracted from the task of finishing her off by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser directly to his front. He turned in pursuit, but reduced her to a flaming hulk in only three salvos at a range under . At 13:10 Beatty turned north and made a general signal to retire. At this time, &quot;Invincible&quot;, trailing the main body of battlecruisers, opened fire on &quot;Cöln&quot;. She fired 18 rounds, all misses, before Beatty&#x27;s main body encountered the crippled &quot;Cöln&quot; shortly after turning north and she was sunk by two salvos from .

===Battle of the Falklands===
The West Indies Squadron of Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock was destroyed by the German East Asia Squadron commanded by Admiral Graf von Spee during the Battle of Coronel on 1 November 1914. In response, the Admiralty ordered that a squadron be sent to destroy the Germans. The squadron, under the command of Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee, consisted of &quot;Invincible&quot; (flag) and &quot;Inflexible&quot;. They departed on 11 November and rendezvoused with several other cruisers under Rear Admiral Stoddard at Abrolhos Rocks off the coast of Brazil on the 26th. The combined force departed the following day and reached Port Stanley on the morning of 7 December.

Spee, making a leisurely voyage back to the Atlantic, decided to destroy the radio station at Port Stanley and sent the armoured cruiser and the light cruiser on the morning of 8 December to see if the harbour was clear of British warships. They were spotted at 07:30 although the pre-dreadnought , grounded in Stanley Harbour to defend the town and its wireless station, did not receive the signal until 07:45. It mattered little because Sturdee was not expecting an engagement and most of his ships were coaling. Furthermore, the armoured cruiser and the light cruiser had one or both of their engines under repair. The armed merchant cruiser &quot;Macedonian&quot; was patrolling the outer harbour entrance while the armoured cruiser was anchored in the outer harbour, scheduled to relieve the &quot;Macedonian&quot; at 08:00. The Germans were not expecting any resistance and the first salvo from &quot;Canopus&quot;″s guns at 09:20 caused them to sheer off from their planned bombardment of the wireless station and fall back on Spee&#x27;s main body.

Sturdee&#x27;s ships did not sortie from the harbour until 9:50, but they could see the retreating German ships on the southwest horizon. The &quot;Invincible&quot;s, fresh out of dry dock, had a advantage over Spee&#x27;s ships which all had fouled bottoms that limited their speeds to at best. The light cruiser was lagging behind the other ships and Inflexible opened fire on her when the range dropped to at 12:55. &quot;Invincible&quot; opened fire shortly afterwards and both ships began straddling Leipzig as the range closed to . At 01:20 Spee ordered his squadron to separate and ordered his light cruisers to turn to the southwest while his armoured cruisers turned to the north east to cover their retreat. The German ships opened fire first at 13:30 and scored their first hit at 13:44 when hit &quot;Invincible&quot;, although the shell burst harmlessly on the belt armour. Both sides fired rapidly during the first half-hour of the engagement before Sturdee opened up the range a little to put his ships outside the effective range of the German guns. British gunnery was very poor during this period, scoring only four hits out of 210 rounds fired. The primary cause was the smoke from the guns and funnels as the British were downwind of the Germans, although one gun of &quot;Invincible&quot;″s &#x27;A&#x27; turret jammed at 13:42 and was out of action for thirty minutes.

Spee turned to the south in the hope of disengaging while the British had their vision obscured, but only opened the range to before the British saw his course change. This was futile as the British battlecruisers gave chase at . Forty minutes later the British opened fire again at . Eight minutes later Spee turned again to the east to give battle. This time his strategy was to close the range on the British ships so he could bring his secondary armament into play. In this he was successful and the 15 cm guns were able to open fire at 15:00 at maximum elevation. On this course the smoke bothered both sides, but multiple hits were made regardless. Those made by the Germans either failed to detonate or hit in some insignificant area. On the contrary &quot;Gneisenau&quot; had her starboard engine room put out of action. Sturdee ordered his ships at 15:15 back across their own wakes to gain the windward advantage. Spee turned to the northwest, as if to attempt to cross the British T, but actually to bring &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;″s undamaged starboard guns to bear as most of those on his port side were out of action. The British continued to hit &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; regularly during this time and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; ceased fire at 4:00 before capsizing at 16:17 with no survivors. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; had been slowed by earlier damage and was battered for another hour and a half by &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Invincible&quot; at ranges down to . Despite the damage her crew continued to fire back until she ceased firing at 16:47. Sturdee was ready to order &#x27;Cease fire&#x27; at 17:15 when an ammunition hoist was freed up and she made her last shot. The British continued to pound her until 17:50, after her captain had given the order to scuttle her at 17:40. She slowly capsized at 18:00 and the British were able to rescue 176 men. &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Inflexible&quot; fired 513 and 661 twelve-inch shells respectively during the battle, but &quot;Inflexible&quot; had been hit only three times and &quot;Invincible&quot; had been hit twenty-two times. Two of her bow compartments were flooded and one hit on her waterline abreast &#x27;P&#x27; turret had flooded a coal bunker and temporarily given her a 15° list. Only one man was killed and five wounded aboard the battlecruisers during the battle.

====Battle of Dogger Bank====

On 23 January 1915, a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Franz von Hipper sortied to clear the Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements. But the British were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of British battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Beatty, which included &quot;Indomitable&quot;. Contact was initiated at 07:20 on the 24th when the British light cruiser &quot;Arethusa&quot; spotted the German light cruiser . By 07:35 the Germans had spotted Beatty&#x27;s force and Hipper ordered a turn to the south at , believing that this would suffice if the ships that he saw to his northwest were British battleships and that he could always increase speed to &#x27;s maximum speed of if they were British battlecruisers.

Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. &quot;Indomitable&quot; managed to exceed 26 knots and Beatty recognised her performance with a signal at 08:55 &quot;Well done, &quot;Indomitable&quot;&quot; Despite this achievement &quot;Indomitable&quot; was the slowest of Beatty&#x27;s ships and gradually fell behind the newer and faster battlecruisers. By 10:48 &quot;Blücher&quot; had been heavily damaged by fire from all the other battlecruisers and her speed had dropped to and her steering gear had been jammed; Beatty ordered &quot;Indomitable&quot; to attack her. But due to a combination of a mistake by Beatty&#x27;s flag lieutenant in signalling, and heavy damage to Beatty&#x27;s flagship which had knocked out her radio and caused enough smoke to obscure her signal halyards so that Beatty couldn&#x27;t communicate with his ships, the rest of the battlecruisers turned away from Hipper&#x27;s main body and engaged &quot;Blücher&quot;. &quot;Indomitable&quot; fired 134 shells at &quot;Blücher&quot; before she capsized and sank at 12:07. After the end of the battle &quot;Indomitable&quot; was ordered to tow &quot;Lion&quot; back to port as one of her engines had been knocked out, the other was failing and she&#x27;d been holed a number of times beneath the waterline. It took over a day and a half at speeds of .

====Dardanelles Campaign====

After the Battle of the Falklands &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Inflexible&quot; were repaired and refitted at Gibraltar. &quot;Invincible&quot; sailed to England and joined the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron while &quot;Inflexible&quot; arrived at the Dardanelles on 24 January 1915 where she replaced &quot;Indefatigable&quot; as the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet. She bombarded Turkish fortifications on 19 February, the start of the Battle of Gallipoli, to little effect, and again on 15 March, with the same results. She was part of the first line of British ships on 18 March as they attempted to suppress the Turkish guns so the minefields could be swept. She was moderately damaged by Turkish gunfire, but was seriously damaged by a mine, probably about in size, that blew a large hole in her starboard bow and flooded the forward torpedo flat, drowning 39 men. She had to be beached at the island of Bozcaada (Tenedos) to prevent her sinking, as she&#x27;d taken in some of water, but she was temporarily repaired with a cofferdam over the hole. She sailed to Malta, escorted by the battleship and cruiser on 6 April. She nearly foundered when her cofferdam worked loose in heavy weather en route and had to be towed stern-first by &quot;Canopus&quot; for six hours while the cofferdam was repaired. She was under repair at Malta until early June before she sailed for home. She reached the UK on 19 June where she joined the 3rd BCS.

Towards the end of the year, the British battlecruiser force was organised into three squadrons, with the 3rd BCS consisting of the three &quot;Invincible&quot;-class ships under the command of Rear Admiral Horace Hood in &quot;Invincible&quot;. The 1st and 3rd BCS had sortied in response to the German bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25 April 1916, but failed to locate the German ships in heavy weather. During the return home, &quot;Invincible&quot; was rammed by the patrol yacht &quot;Goissa&quot;. &quot;Goissa&quot;″s bow was embedded in &quot;Invincible&quot;″s side which partially stoved-in. &quot;Invincible&quot;″s speed was reduced to through flooding and she was forced to haul out of line and proceed independently to Rosyth for repairs which lasted until 22 May.

===Battle of Jutland===

At the end of May 1916, the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron was temporarily assigned to the Grand Fleet for gunnery practice. On 30 May, the entire Grand Fleet, along with Admiral Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, had been ordered to sea to prepare for an excursion by the German High Seas Fleet. To support Beatty, Rear Admiral Hood took his three battlecruisers ahead of the Grand Fleet. At about 14:30 &quot;Invincible&quot; intercepted a radio message from the British light cruiser , attached to Beatty&#x27;s Battlecruiser Force, reporting the sighting of two enemy cruisers. This was amplified by other reports of seven enemy ships steering north. Hood interpreted this as an attempt to escape through the Skagerrak and ordered an increase in speed to at 15:11 and steered East-Southeast to cut off the fleeing ships. Twenty minutes later &quot;Invincible&quot; intercepted a message from Beatty reporting five enemy battlecruisers in sight and later signals reporting that he was engaging the enemy on a south-easterly course. At 16:06 Hood ordered full speed and a course of south-southeast in an attempt to converge on Beatty. At 16:56, with no British ships in sight, Hood requested Beatty&#x27;s course, position and speed, but never received a reply.

Hood continued on course until 17:40 when gunfire was spotted in the direction to which his light cruiser had been dispatched to investigate other gunfire flashes. &quot;Chester&quot; encountered four light cruisers of Hipper&#x27;s 2nd Scouting Group and was badly damaged before Hood turned to investigate and was able to drive the German cruisers away from &quot;Chester&quot;. At 17:53 &quot;Invincible&quot; opened fire on and the other two &quot;Invincible&quot;s followed two minutes later. The German ships turned for the south after fruitlessly firing torpedoes at 18:00 and attempted to find shelter in the mist. As they turned &quot;Invincible&quot; hit &quot;Wiesbaden&quot; in the engine room and knocked out her engines while &quot;Inflexible&quot; hit once. The 2nd Scouting Group was escorted by the light cruiser and 31 destroyers of the 2nd and 9th Flotillas and the 12th Half-Flotilla which attacked the 3rd BCS in succession. They were driven off by Hood&#x27;s remaining light cruiser and the five destroyers of his escort. In a confused action the Germans only launched 12 torpedoes and disabled the destroyer with gunfire. Having turned due west to close on Beatty&#x27;s ships, the &quot;Invincible&quot;s were broadside to the oncoming torpedoes, but &quot;Invincible&quot; turned north, while &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; turned south to present their narrowest profile to the torpedoes. All the torpedoes missed although one passed underneath &quot;Inflexible&quot; without detonating. As &quot;Invincible&quot; turned north, her helm jammed and she had to come to a stop to fix the problem, but this was quickly done and the squadron reformed heading west.

At 18:21, with both Beatty and the Grand Fleet converging on him, Hood turned south to lead Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers. Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers were away and the &quot;Invincible&quot;s almost immediately opened fire on Hipper&#x27;s flagship and . &quot;Indomitable&quot; hit &quot;Derfflinger&quot; three times and once, while the &quot;Lützow&quot; quickly took 10 hits from , &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Invincible&quot;, including two hits below the waterline forward by &quot;Invincible&quot; that would ultimately doom her. But at 18:30 &quot;Invincible&quot; abruptly appeared as a clear target before &quot;Lützow&quot; and &quot;Derfflinger&quot;. The two German ships then fired three salvoes each at &quot;Invincible&quot;, and sank her in 90 seconds. A 305 mm (12-inch) shell from the third salvo struck &quot;Invincible&quot;″s midships &#x27;Q&#x27; turret, flash detonated the magazines below, and the ship blew up and broke in half, killing all but 6 of her crew of 1,032 officers and men, including Hood.

&quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; remained in company with Beatty for the rest of the battle. They encountered Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers only away as the sun was setting about 20:19 and opened fire. &quot;Seydlitz&quot; was hit five times before the battlecruisers were rescued by the pre-dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Mauve and the British shifted fire to the new threat. Three of the predreadnoughts were hit before they too were able to turn into the gloom.

===Post-Jutland career===
The loss of three battlecruisers at Jutland (the others were and ) led to the force being reorganised into two squadrons, with &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; in the 2nd BCS. However, after Jutland there was little significant naval activity, for the &quot;Invincible&quot;s, other than routine patrolling, thanks to the Kaiser&#x27;s order that his ships should not be allowed to go to sea unless assured of victory. The end of the war saw the end for many of the older vessels, not least the two remaining &quot;Invincible&quot;-class ships. Both were sent to the Reserve Fleet in 1919, and were paid off in March 1920.

After the end of the war, Chile began seeking additional ships for its navy. In April 1920, Chile bought &quot;Canada&quot; and four destroyers, all of which had been ordered by Chile prior to the war&#x27;s outbreak and requisitioned by the British for the war. Further planned expansion included &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot;, but when the secret negotiations to acquire them were leaked to the press, a major uproar erupted in Chile. The most visible dissension came from a bloc of officers in the navy, who publicly opposed any possible purchase and instead promoted a &quot;New Navy&quot; which would acquire submarines and aircraft. They argued that these weapons would cost less and give the country, and its lengthy coastline, better protection from external threats. The ships were not bought for reasons of cost, but neither were the aircraft its supporters had been hoping for. Both were sold for scrap on 1 December 1921.

<text>A production assistant, also known as a PA, is a member of the film crew and is a job title used in filmmaking and television for a person responsible for various aspects of a production. The job of a PA can vary greatly depending on the budget and specific requirements of a production as well as whether the production is unionized.

Production assistants on films are sometimes attached to individual actors or filmmakers.

==Television and feature film==
In unionized television and feature film, production assistants are usually divided into different categories. Variations exist depending on a show&#x27;s structure or region of the world.

*&quot;Office PAs&quot; usually spend most hours in the respective show&#x27;s production office handling such tasks as phones, deliveries, script copies, lunch pick-ups, and related tasks in coordination with the production manager and production coordinator.
*&quot;Set PAs&quot; work on the physical set of the production, whether on location or on a sound stage. They report to the assistant director (AD) department and key set PA if one is so designated. Duties include calling out &quot;rolls&quot; and &quot;cuts&quot;, locking up (making sure nothing interferes with a take), wrangling actors and background, facilitating communication between departments, distributing paperwork and radios, and related tasks as mandated by the ADs. Set PAs usually work 12- to 16-hour days with the possibility at the end of a shoot to work more than 20 hours a single day.
*&quot;Post-production PAs&quot; work in an administrative office, focusing on film quality, arranging schedules, organizing workload and getting coffee.
*&quot;Truck PAs&quot; drive trucks carrying equipment from place to place.
*&quot;Locations PAs&quot; accompany the location manager and assist in any needed tasks. &quot;They&#x27;re wherever the location manager needs them to be on any particular day.&quot;
*&quot;Extra or daily PAs&quot; are brought and needed, frequently supporting a second unit. 
*&quot;Set Runner PAs&quot; do general tasks, such as buying stationery, taking lunch orders, copying call sheets and getting coffee.

==Commercials==
Commercial Set PAs share the same responsibilities as their Television and Feature Film counterparts (see &quot;Set PAs&quot; above), but also inherit additional responsibilities traditionally encompassed by other departments in the television and feature film structure. These responsibilities range from providing both critical and mundane production support equipment such as dollies, cranes, director&#x27;s chairs and pop-up tents to standing in for talent and even filling in for other departments who might be shortstaffed. It is not atypical for a commercial set PA to be seen handling trash one minute, and the next minute assisting the electricians or grips with a set-up. A select group of commercial set PAs are given the responsibility of driving and managing the production and camera cube trucks. This responsibility is often given to the more senior PAs because it provides several extra days of pay.

Set PAs in commercials are more commonly hired by the production coordinator and/or production manager as opposed to an AD or key set PA. However, many commercial ADs will also perform this responsibility.

Standard rate for a commercial PA in the Los Angeles area is a flat rate of $200 per day. On February 1, 2008, benefits for qualifying freelance PAs became available through the Producer&#x27;s Health Benefits Plan.

==Union vs. non-union==
With the exception of Quebec, in North America, no union currently exists for production assistants, but the affiliation of a production with a union (or &quot;unions&quot;) can affect the job responsibilities of a PA. Less unionized film productions have more positions that can be serviced by non-union personnel; consequently, PAs on such productions may take on a greater variety of non-traditional duties. Examples of this would be a PA setting a light bounce (grip department) or driving a passenger van (teamster/transportation department). PAs on a union production generally have less variety in their job duties whereas a non-union PA can be asked to perform any kind of task by a department head.

In British Columbia, which has the third largest film and television production sector in North America, PAs are represented by the Directors Guild of Canada. Production assistants represented by the DGC work in the Locations Department and work both on and off set with duties including locking up the set, traffic control, echoing rolls, firewatching, and liaising with the public and location owners. The Key-PA is in charge of all the PAs and is the 1st ADs&#x27; right-hand man when it comes to do with the on set aspects regarding a location. From this position DGC PA&#x27;s can move up through the Locations Department or the Assistant Direction (AD) Department as either a Training Locations Manager (TAL) or a Training Assistant Director (TAD), respectively. Office production assistants work in the production office as an Office PA and they work for the Production Manager, Production Coordinator, Assistant Production Coordinator, and / or other office staff in maintaining the work-flow in the office. From this position, Office PAs can work their way up through the office by becoming an Assistant Production Coordinator (APOC), which is unionized under IATSE 891. Pay for PAs according to the DGC Collective Agreement in BC is $283.93 (non-key) to $290.28 (key) for a 15-hour day. An 8-hour day is approximately $117.00.

In Quebec, the Set PA is part of what is called the &quot;Unit Department&quot; or &quot;Régie&quot;. Usually, there is a Unit Manager, Assistant Unit Manager, Set PA, Truck PA, Set Runner, and the &quot;dailies&quot; as needed for street blocking and extra set ups. In other states and provinces these duties are often taken care of by the AD Department, Locations or Transport. The Unit Manager and his/her team are the ones who deal with the daily logistics of shooting on location and/or in studio.

There are two film unions in Quebec: IATSE 514 and AQTIS: L&#x27;Alliance québécoise des techniciens de l&#x27;image et du son. In both cases the PA&#x27;s are unionized.

== Publication ==
Production assistants are also present in fields other than film and television, as publication businesses also have a need for PAs to regulate the production process of making professional written pieces such as articles, books, records or any other kind of production involving the preparation of written words.

=== Educational and publishing companies ===
The tasks taken on by a PA will depend on the type of educational and/or publishing company that employs them. If the assistant works at a textbook or publishing company, they may oversee the art and composition of written works. P.A.s at educational companies may also oversee work in proofreading departments, as well as for freelance copy editors and authors. When looking at documents and other materials uploaded by the author the production assistant has to make sure everything falls within the requirements of the company they work for. This includes items such as the format, correct file types, positioning, captions and obtaining copyright forms from authors.

If the assistant is part of a publications department for a scientific or professional organization, they have daily jobs that which involve keeping records that are important for their company. They may take care of editing, sending or reading information in databases or manuscripts. Production assistants may also team up with Information Technology workers to help streamline the tasks of the publications departments since it involves keeping track of large amounts of data and information. Working with an I.T. department to create a specific sorting program can improve the speed at which documents are proofed and organized.

=== Entertainment companies ===
In entertainment companies, production assignments may have to do technical work such as typesetting, printing and binding. They must also be good communicators and be good with deadlines. When working for magazines or newspapers, production assistants may need to keep track of things like individual teams and the cost of producing a physical product. Clients and stakeholders may be involved in a magazine, so P.A.&#x27;s have to be professional. There may also be journalists who are on deadlines or need extensions. There are also creative processes that a production assistant can be involved with. They can work with book designers or magazines to ensure a client&#x27;s specifications are followed properly and may then have to send a copy of the draft for approval to clients. This can last until the final piece has been completed. When printing a piece of work, production assistants may deal with is how files are supposed to be submitted to printers, along with publication dates, and any printing or copy issues. Even after a final piece is complete, the PA may need to ask a client their thoughts on final product.

<text>Craft service, Crafts service, or craft services is the department in film, television and video production which provides cast and crew with snacks, drinks and other assistance.

Craft service workers, nicknamed &quot;crafty&quot;, are so called because they provide their services to the other departments, known as crafts, in a set. In the United States and Canada they are represented by a union, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE). Other departments such as camera, sound, electricians, grips, props, art director, set decorator, special effects, hair and make-up, are referred to as crafts. Craft service is also an IATSE stagecraft and the work is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

The purpose of the crafts service union local is to service the other IATSE crafts. Crafts service laborers are one of the few crew jobs that can cross jurisdictional lines to assist other department crew members including set dressers, property persons, camera persons, grips, lighting technicians, costumers, make up artists and hair stylists. Their work can range from assisting set dressers with transporting decor to an underwater set, maintaining shop equipment for the special effects department, and working as a layout board technician to help protect filming locations. Laborers affiliated with the Laborers&#x27; International Union of North America (LiUNA!) Local 724 are the other unionized crew members who can cross jurisdictional lines to assist IATSE carpenters, sheet metal workers, plasterers, and off-production painters. While the laborers would provide cross-jurisdictional service to these trades during the construction of new sets or wrecking of sets, the labor work on stages or sets and locations during the actual shooting of the picture would be provided by crafts service workers.

Craft service is different from catering; craft service refers to the food always available to the crew while they are working, while catering is provided by a catering company or a restaurant and handles full meals.

Typically there is one main table where the snacks and coffee are set up (which is simply called &quot;crafty&quot; or &quot;the crafty table&quot;). Occasionally there are two craft service stations, with one being for cast and crew and another for non-union background actors. A &quot;satellite&quot; crafty may be set up next to the camera, as they may not be able to leave their workstations. In addition to snacks and drinks, the craft service department may perform odd jobs including digging holes for camera placement, layout protective materials, and keeping the set clean.
