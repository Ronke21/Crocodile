<text>Jim Lee (; born August 11, 1964) is a Korean-born American comic book artist, writer, editor, and publisher. As of 2023, he is the President, Publisher, and Chief Creative Officer of DC Comics. In recognition of his work, Lee has received a Harvey Award, Inkpot Award and three Wizard Fan Awards.

Lee got his start in the industry in 1987 as an artist for Marvel Comics, illustrating titles such as &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; and &quot;The Punisher War Journal&quot; before becoming widely popular through his work on &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;. On that book, Lee worked with writer Chris Claremont, with whom he co-created the character Gambit. That led to a 1991 spinoff series on which Lee and Claremont were the initial creative team. The debut issue, &quot;X-Men&quot; #1, which Lee penciled and co-wrote with Claremont, became the best-selling comic book of all time, according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. Lee&#x27;s style was later used for the designs of the &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot;.

In 1992, Lee and several other artists founded the publishing company, Image Comics, to publish their creator-owned comics. Lee published titles such as &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot; and &quot;Gen13&quot; through his studio, WildStorm Productions. In 1998, wanting to spend less time as a publisher and more time illustrating, Lee sold WildStorm to DC Comics, and ran WildStorm as a DC imprint until 2010. During this period, he also illustrated successful titles set in DC&#x27;s main fictional universe, such as the year-long storylines &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;), books (including &quot;Superman Unchained&quot;), and the New 52 run of &quot;Justice League&quot;. On February 18, 2010, it was announced that DC Comics had appointed Lee and Dan DiDio as its co-publishers (replacing Paul Levitz). In June 2018, Lee was also appointed the company&#x27;s chief creative officer, replacing Geoff Johns. In February 2020, when DiDio left the company, Lee became its sole publisher.

Aside from illustrating comics, he has done work as a designer or creative director on other DC products, such as action figures, video games, branded automobiles and backpacks. Outside the comics industry, Lee has designed album covers, as well as the packaging of one of General Mills&#x27; monster-themed cereal boxes for its 2014 Halloween collection. His private commission sketches command high prices ranging up to thousands of dollars.

==Early life==
Jim Lee was born on August 11, 1964, in Seoul, South Korea. In a December 2023 interview, he describes his nostaglic memories of life in that country, where he first began drawing at a young age, using oil pastels with an art teacher who visited his home, and developing a love of Max Fleischer&#x27;s 1940s animated &quot;Superman&quot; series. His strongest memory of living in Seoul, however, was when, at the age of 4 or 5, he was hit by a small truck while crossing the street, later regaining consciousness in the hospital in the presence of his father, a doctor. Lee says that the incident increased his parents&#x27; sense of protectiveness as he grew older, and summarizes his early years by saying, &quot;Comics. Trauma. Art. That was the be-all, end-all of my childhood.&quot;

In the aftermath of the Korean War, Lee&#x27;s parents desired a better, safer life for their family, and moved to the United States when Lee was in elementary school. They lived in Warren, Ohio, and Youngstown, Ohio, before settling in St. Louis, Missouri, where Lee lived a &quot;typical middle-class childhood&quot;. Lee attended River Bend Elementary School in Chesterfield and later St. Louis Country Day School, where he drew posters for school plays. Having had to learn English when he first came to the U.S. instilled in Lee with the sense of being an outsider, as did the &quot;preppy, upper-class&quot; atmosphere of Country Day. As a result, on the rare occasions that his parents bought him comics, Lee&#x27;s favorite characters were the X-Men, because they were outsiders themselves. Lee says that he benefited as an artist by connecting with characters that were themselves disenfranchised, like Spider-Man, or who were born of such backgrounds, such as Superman, who was created by two Jewish men from Cleveland to lift their spirits during the Depression. Lee also connected with Superman because like Lee, Superman was &quot;the ultimate immigrant&quot;, which helped him assimilate into American culture, and provided him a sense of &quot;sanctuary&quot; from the pressures he felt as an immigrant who did not fit in, and the shame he felt as a Korean. For this reason, Superman&#x27;s practice of wearing eyeglasses in order to effect a disguise was something Lee sympathized with, as he felt that he exhibited an &quot;American side&quot; at school, and then his &quot;Korean side&quot; at home. He developed a desire to one day work in comics between the ages of nine and twelve. Though given a Korean name at birth, he chose the name Jim when he became a naturalized U.S. citizen at age 12.

Lee attended Princeton University. During his junior year in 1984, Lee drew editorial cartoons for the school newspaper, &quot;The Daily Princetonian&quot;. Lee&#x27;s classmates predicted in his senior yearbook that he would found his own comic book company. Lee, however, was resigned to following his father&#x27;s career in medicine, continuing at Princeton by studying psychology, with the intention of becoming a medical doctor. This was largely influenced by the strict expectations of his parents, whom Lee said were &quot;really aggressive in terms of how they wanted me to find true success,&quot; owing to views about security and fear of failure that Lee describes as being typical in Korean households.

In 1986, as he was preparing to graduate, Lee took an art class that reignited his love of drawing, and led to his rediscovery of comics at a time when works such as Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons&#x27; &quot;Watchmen&quot; spurred a renaissance within the American comics industry. After obtaining his psychology degree, Lee, having grown to view a career in medicine to long escalator ride that he did not wish to make, decided to postpone applying to medical school for one year, in order to give himself time to break into comics. When he laid out this plan to his parents, it led to a heated argument that prompted Lee to flee his house. His father pursued him and reconciled with him, expressing understanding of his commitment to his dreams. Lee says that this influenced him to refrain from ever placing the same level of pressure on his own children. Earning the reluctant blessing of his parents, Lee vowed that he would attend medical school if he did not break into the comic book industry in the gap year he allotted for himself. He set up a small drafting table next to his bed, and would spend 8 to 10 hours each day drawing, to the point that he suffered from sore knuckles and a pinched nerve that required his father to give him a shoulder brace.

==Comics career==
===Rise to fame at Marvel Comics===
The samples that Lee initially submitted to various publishers did not find success. When he befriended St. Louis-area comics artists Don Secrease and Rick Burchett, they convinced him he needed to show his portfolio to editors in person, prompting Lee to attend a New York comics convention, where he met editor Archie Goodwin. Goodwin invited Lee to Marvel Comics, where the aspiring artist received his first assignment by editor Carl Potts, who hired him to pencil the mid-list series &quot;Alpha Flight&quot;, segu√©ing from that title in 1989 to &quot;&quot;. Lee&#x27;s work on the &quot;Punisher: War Journal&quot; was inspired by artists such as Frank Miller, David Ross, Kevin Nowlan, and Whilce Portacio, as well as Japanese manga.

In 1989, Lee filled in for regular illustrator Marc Silvestri on &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #248 and did another guest stint on issues 256 through 258 as part of the &quot;Acts of Vengeance&quot; storyline, eventually becoming the series&#x27; ongoing artist with issue #268, following Silvestri&#x27;s departure. During his stint on &quot;Uncanny&quot;, Lee first worked with inker Scott Williams, who would become a long-time collaborator. During his run on the title, Lee co-created the character Gambit with long-time X-Men writer Chris Claremont.

Lee&#x27;s artwork quickly gained popularity in the eyes of enthusiastic fans, which allowed him to gain greater creative control of the franchise. In 1991, Lee helped launch a second &quot;X-Men&quot; series simply called &quot;X-Men&quot; vol. 2, as both the artist and as co-writer with Claremont. &quot;X-Men&quot; vol. 2 #1 is still the best-selling comic book of all-time with sales of over 8.1 million copies and nearly $7 million, according to a public proclamation by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con. The sales figures were generated in part by publishing the issue with five different variant covers, four of which show different characters from the book that formed a single image when laid side by side, and a fifth, gatefold cover of that combined image, large numbers of which were purchased by retailers who anticipated fans and speculators who would buy multiple copies in order to acquire a complete collection of the covers. Lee designed new character uniforms for the series, including those worn by Cyclops, Jean Grey, Rogue, Betsy Braddock and Storm. He also created the villain Omega Red. Lee&#x27;s style of rendering the X-Men was later used for the designs the television program &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot;. Actor/comedian Taran Killam, who ventured into comics writing with &quot;The Illegitimates&quot;, has cited &quot;X-Men&quot; #1 as the book that inspired his interest in comics.

Stan Lee interviewed Lee in the documentary series &quot;The Comic Book Greats&quot;.

===Image Comics and WildStorm, return to Marvel===
Enticed by the idea of being able to exert more control over his own work, in 1992, Lee accepted the invitation to join six other artists who broke away from Marvel to form Image Comics, which would publish their creator-owned titles. Lee&#x27;s group of titles was initially called Aegis Entertainment before being christened WildStorm Productions, and published Lee&#x27;s initial title &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot;, which Lee pencilled and co-wrote, and other series created by Lee in the same shared universe. The other major series of the initial years of Wildstorm, for which Lee either created characters, co-plotted or provided art for, included &quot;Stormwatch&quot;, &quot;Deathblow&quot; and &quot;Gen13&quot;.

In 1993, Lee and his friend, Valiant Comics publisher Steven Massarsky, arranged a Valiant/Image Comics crossover miniseries called &quot;Deathmate&quot;, in which the Valiant characters would interact with those of WildStorm, and of Lee&#x27;s fellow Image partner, Rob Liefeld. The miniseries would consist of four &quot;center books&quot; (each one denoted by a color rather than an issue number), two each produced by the respective companies, plus a prologue and epilogue book. Wildstorm produced &quot;Deathmate Black&quot;, with Lee himself contributing to the writing. He illustrated the covers for that book, the &quot;Deathmate Tourbook&quot; and the prologue book, as well as contributing to the prologue&#x27;s interior inks.

WildStorm would expand its line to include other ongoing titles whose creative work was handled by other writers and artists, some of which were spinoffs of the earlier titles, or properties owned by other creators, such as Whilce Portacio&#x27;s &quot;Wetworks&quot;. As publisher, Lee later expanded his comics line creating two publishing imprints of WildStorm, Homage and Cliffhanger (that years later merged and were replaced by a single WildStorm Signature imprint), to publish creator-owned comics by some selected creators of the US comics industry.

Lee and Rob Liefeld, another Marvel-illustrator-turned-Image-founder, returned to Marvel in 1996 to participate in a reboot of several classic characters; the project was known as Heroes Reborn. While Liefeld reworked &quot;Captain America&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot;, Lee plotted &quot;Iron Man&quot; and plotted and illustrated &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; issues #1‚Äì6. Halfway through the project, Lee&#x27;s studio took over Liefeld&#x27;s two titles, finishing all four series. According to Lee, Marvel proposed continuing the Heroes Reborn lineup indefinitely, but under the condition that Lee would draw at least one of them himself, which he refused to do. Instead, he accepted an offer to re-imagine and relaunch (in the role of editor) three mainstream Marvel Universe titles: &quot;Defenders&quot;, &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;, and &quot;Nick Fury&quot;. Though scheduled to debut in December 1997, these three relaunches never appeared.

Lee returned to WildStorm, where he would publish series such as &quot;The Authority&quot; and &quot;Planetary&quot;, as well as Alan Moore&#x27;s imprint, America&#x27;s Best Comics. Lee himself wrote and illustrated a 12-issue series called &quot;Divine Right: The Adventures of Max Faraday&quot;, in which an internet slacker inadvertently manages to download the secrets of the universe, and is thrown into a wild fantasy world.

=== Move to DC Comics ===
Due to declining sales across the U.S. comics industry, and his view that his role as publisher and growing family demands interfered with his role as an artist, Lee left Image Comics and sold WildStorm to DC Comics in late 1998, enabling him to focus once again on art. He drew a &quot;Batman Black and White&quot; backup story for the first issue of &quot;&quot; (March 2000). In 2003, he collaborated on a 12-issue run on &quot;Batman&quot; with writer Jeph Loeb. &quot;&quot; became a sales success. That same year, Ubisoft released &quot;&quot;, a side-scrolling beat &#x27;em up video game whose titular villain was designed by Lee, a fact that served as the main draw to the game.

In 2004 Lee illustrated &quot;For Tomorrow&quot;, a 12-issue story in &quot;Superman&quot; by writer Brian Azzarello.

In 2005, Lee teamed with Frank Miller on &quot;All Star Batman &amp; Robin, the Boy Wonder&quot;, a series plagued by delays, including a one-year gap between the releases of the fourth and fifth issues. Lee himself took full responsibility for the delays, explaining that his involvement with the &quot;DC Universe Online&quot; video game were the cause, and not Miller&#x27;s scripts, which had been completed for some time. &quot;All-Star&quot; also drew controversy for Miller&#x27;s dialogue, pacing and depiction of the characters, garnering reviews that were mixed to negative, though Lee&#x27;s art was praised, and the book enjoyed excellent sales. A total of 10 issues were produced of that series, the tenth issue being released on September 24, 2015. In September 2015 Lee indicated the possibility of returning to the book to conclude it with Miller&#x27;s originally intended ending, but this series was never produced.

Lee continued to run WildStorm as editorial director, sometimes working on both DC and WildStorm properties simultaneously. In September 2006, Lee returned to &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot; with Grant Morrison as the writer, but only one issue of that series&#x27; fourth volume was published.

Lee provided artwork for the album booklet for Daughtry&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Leave This Town&quot;.
In February 2006, it was announced that Lee would be involved with the concept art for the DC Comics online game &quot;DC Universe Online&quot;. In 2008, Lee was named the Executive Creative Director of the forthcoming game, which at that time was expected to be released in 2009.
In February 2010, Lee and Dan DiDio were named Co-Publishers of DC Comics by DC Entertainment President Diane Nelson. According to Lee, this did not indicate another move away from the creative side of comics, as his Co-Publishing duties granted him greater creative involvement in the entire DC line and allow him to illustrate titles. DC announced they were ending the WildStorm imprint in September 2010.

===2010s===

In September 2011, DC Comics instituted an initiative called The New 52, in which the publisher cancelled all of its superhero titles and relaunched 52 new series with No. 1 issues, wiping out most of the then-current continuity. Lee and writer Geoff Johns, DC Comics&#x27; Chief Creative Officer, were the architects of the relaunch, which was initiated with a new &quot;Justice League&quot; series, written and illustrated by Johns and Lee, respectively. The series&#x27; first story arc was a new origin of the Justice League, which depicted the return of DC&#x27;s primary superheroes to the team. Lee&#x27;s illustration for the cover of issue No. 12 drew media attention for its depiction of Superman and Wonder Woman in a passionate embrace, a rendition that Lee said was inspired by Gustav Klimt&#x27;s painting &quot;The Kiss&quot; and Alfred Eisenstaedt&#x27;s 1945 photograph &quot;V-J Day in Times Square&quot;.

In July 2012, as part of San Diego Comic-Con, Lee and Dan DiDio participated in the production of &quot;Heroic Proportions&quot;, an episode of the Syfy reality television competition series &quot;Face Off&quot;, in which special effects makeup artists compete to create the best makeup according to each episode&#x27;s theme. Lee and DiDio presented the contestants with that episode&#x27;s challenge, to create a new superhero, with six DC Comics artists on hand to help them develop their ideas. The winning entry&#x27;s character, Infernal Core by Anthony Kosar, was featured in &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; #16 (March 2013), which was published January 30, 2013. The episode premiered on January 22, 2013, as the second episode of the fourth season.

In October 2012, DC Entertainment and Kia Motors America entered a partnership to benefit We Can Be Heroes, a campaign dedicated to fighting hunger in the Horn of Africa. The campaign involves the creation of eight Justice League-inspired vehicles, on whose designs Lee collaborated. Each vehicle is tied thematically to a member of the Justice League, the first of which was a Batman-themed Kia Optima. A Superman-themed version inspired by Lee&#x27;s art followed in February 2013.
In 2013, Lee designed a new version of the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; character Scorpion for use in the DC fighting video game &quot;&quot;.

On May 4, 2013, DC published a Free Comic Book Day sneak preview of &quot;Superman Unchained&quot;, an ongoing series written by Scott Snyder and illustrated by Lee, which was published on June 12, 2013, and intended to coincide with the feature film &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, which opened two days later.

In 2013, Lee was announced as a member of a newly formed advisory board of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, a non-profit organization founded in 1986 chartered to protect the First Amendment rights of the comics community.

In 2014, General Mills enlisted the help of DC Comics to create new designs for its monster-themed cereals in time for Halloween. The designs, revealed on August 6, consisted of a Boo Berry design by Lee, a Count Chocula design by Terry Dodson and a Franken-Berry design by Dave Johnson. Describing the task of designing a cartoon character, Lee explained, &quot;Drawing simpler characters is a lot more work and harder than drawing something that&#x27;s more complicated or has a lot of renderings. Every line counts and every distance between the eyes and the ears, it&#x27;s all super critical.&quot;

In February 2015, DC released &quot;The Multiversity: Mastermen&quot;, the seventh issue of Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;The Multiversity&quot; project, which Lee illustrated. That same year, Lee provided designs for a Batman action figure as part of the company&#x27;s BlueLine Edition series, to be released at that year&#x27;s San Diego Comic-Con. A Superman figure designed by Lee followed in 2016. November 2015 saw the debut of the miniseries &quot;Batman: Europa&quot;, on which Lee collaborated with writers Brian Azzarello and Matteo Casali and artist Giuseppe Camuncoli. The book, which was inspired by Lee&#x27;s time living in Italy, was originally announced by DC in 2004, and intended to feature Lee&#x27;s painted art over Camuncoli&#x27;s layouts, but after a series of delays, it was published with conventional artwork as a four-issue miniseries to positive reviews.

In 2016, Lee was the main artist on the one-shot &quot;Harley Quinn and the Suicide Squad April Fool&#x27;s Special&quot; sharing art duties on that book with Sean Galloway. That August, DC released the first of eight issues of Lee and writer Rob Williams&#x27; new &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; series, as part of the DC Rebirth relaunch.

In July 2017, Marvel decided to capitalize on Lee&#x27;s popularity by releasing 29 of its books with covers reprinting Lee&#x27;s art for its 1992 Series 1 X-Men trading cards.

In March 2018, Lee and writer James Tynion IV launched the series &quot;The Immortal Men&quot; as part of DC&#x27;s New Age of Heroes line. That June, following the departure of DC Entertainment&#x27;s Diane Nelson, and Geoff Johns&#x27; stepping down from his role as Chief Creative Officer (CCO) of DC Comics, Lee was named DC&#x27;s CCO, a role he would assume while continuing to act as publisher with Dan DiDio.

In May and June 2019, Lee, writer Tom King, and CW series actresses Nafessa Williams, Candice Patton, and Danielle Panabaker toured five U.S. military bases in Kuwait with the United Service Organizations (USO), where they visited the approximately 12,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in that country as part of DC&#x27;s 80th anniversary of Batman celebration.

On June 5, 2019, Lee and the fashion accessory brand HEX launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for two Batman-branded backpacks designed specifically for comics artists and collectors. The former, the HEX x Jim Lee Artist Backpack, is designed with features specifically for transporting art supplies and portfolios, such as a 11&quot; x 17&quot; dedicated portfolio cases, waterproof pockets for inks and paints, and organizers for brushes and pens. The latter, the HEX x Jim Lee Collectors Backpack, is designed with features for transporting art collections, such as fleece-lined pockets for comics, a poster tube holder, a pocket for the &quot;Overstreet Price Guide&quot;, and an anti-theft zipper lock. In addition to the Batman artwork by Lee that adorns both backpacks, the collectors version features batarang zipper pulls.

===2020s===
In late February 2020, following the departure of Co-Publisher Dan DiDio, Lee became the sole Publisher of DC Comics. The following month, amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, Lee began a 60-day series of daily sketches, auctioning off the proceeds of each sketch to a different random brick and mortar store that had closed as a result of the pandemic. The endeavor, which was done in partnership with DC and the BINC Foundation, saw the completion of the final sketch in July 2021. That drawing, which depicted Jason Todd, sold for $25,100 on eBay, while the entire campaign raised a total of over $800,000 for beleaguered comics shops.

On November 25, 2021, Lee appeared alongside several other Asian and Pacific Islander celebrities, including actor Simu Liu, tennis player Naomi Osaka, and &quot;Top Chef&quot; host Padma Lakshmi, in the Thanksgiving Day television program &quot;See Us Coming Together: A Sesame Street Special.&quot; The program was billed as a celebration of those communities, and introduced the series&#x27; first Asian American Muppet, a seven-year-old Korean girl named Ji-Young. The special premiered on HBO Max, PBSKids, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, as part of the Sesame Workshop&#x27;s &quot;Coming Together&quot; initiative, which endeavors to educate children about race, culture, and racial justice. It featured Lee showcasing his illustration of Ji-Young interacting with other Muppets.

Lee was promoted to President of DC Comics in May 2023.

In 2024 Jim Lee&#x27;s art agent, Albert Moy, publicly announced for the first time in 15 years that Lee was accepting original sketch commissions that would be delivered to customers at conventions at which Lee would be in attendance. The prices ranged from USD $1,000 for 3.25&quot; by 7&quot; head shots in profile, to $25,000 to $35,000 for either full recreations of other artists&#x27; covers or 11&quot; by 17&quot;, full figure, single character illustrations with substantial backgrounds.

== Technique and materials ==
Lee is known to use F lead for his pencil work. While inking his own pencils on &quot;The Punisher War Journal&quot;, Lee began using a crowquill nib for the first time. When illustrating full page commissions or sketches, Lee uses the drybrush technique in order to achieve greytone areas with an uneven texture, applying india ink to the paper and then rubbing it with a tissue, or by using a brush to fill in areas of black, and then using the brush to effect drybrush effects after it is nearly depleted of ink. To create white highlights, he uses a Pentel correction fluid pen.

In talking about the artist&#x27;s work ethic, Lee has said, &quot;Sometimes I wonder if we ever really improve as artists or if the nirvana derived from completing a piece blinds us enough to love what we have created and move on to the next piece. If we could see the work as it is, with years of reflection in the here and now, how many images would end up in the trash rather than on the racks?&quot;

In a March 2024 interview with Agence France-Presse, Lee was asked if AI-generated art was a threat to the comics industry. He replied, &quot;We have to figure out a way to live in a world where it exists, and the source material from which it derives its content is properly credited and compensated. But even if it were accepted and someone were going to pay me to use an AI engine to create work, I just wouldn&#x27;t do it. I don&#x27;t create art just so I can have something to get paid for. I love sitting down with a piece of paper and a pencil... I enter this fugue state, hours go by and it feels like 15 minutes, and at the end, I have this incredible sense of satisfaction because I went on this journey and I&#x27;ve created something. Typing something into a prompt and getting something two minutes later? I&#x27;m robbing myself of the whole point of why I got into this business.&quot;

When asked about his artistic inspirations, Lee cited Neal Adams, John Byrne, Kevin Nowlan, Mike Mignola, Art Adams, Milo Manara, and Barry Windsor-Smith.

==Praise and criticism==
In the February 1991 issue of &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;, writer/artist Barry Windsor-Smith was being interviewed for his Wolverine story &quot;Weapon X&quot;, and touching upon the then-current &quot;X-Men&quot; comics, Windsor-Smith stated:

Five years later, however, after having come to regret working on the &quot;Wildstorm Rising&quot; crossover story arc that ran the previous year in the books of Lee&#x27;s creator-owned studio, WildStorm Productions, Windsor-Smith expressed a different assessment of Lee in an interview with &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;. Windsor-Smith criticized the depth of the work of artists like Lee and Rob Liefeld, and those whom they influenced (whom he referred to as &quot;the Liefelds and the Lees&quot;), stating:

&quot;The Comics Journal&quot; publisher Gary Groth concurred, stating, &quot;Lee&#x27;s work is obviously more technically accomplished than Liefeld&#x27;s, but otherwise it&#x27;s conceptually comparable.&quot; Windsor-Smith added that he had believed in the Image Comics&#x27; founders&#x27; exodus from Marvel Comics as an important step for creator autonomy and creator rights, and was angered when Lee and Liefeld returned to Marvel to do &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot;.

In 2024, following the announcement that Lee would accept commissions to be delivered to customers at conventions, a small subset of fans expressed annoyance for the high prices given by Lee&#x27; agent, Albert Moy. A majority of the comics industry expressed support on social media for Lee&#x27;s right to charge these prices including Bengal, Tom Taylor, Fabian Nicieza, and Mark Brooks. Many comic book writers and artists also shared many stories of Lee&#x27;s previous generosity on social media. On Twitter, comic book writer, Gail Simone shared a story of how Lee drew free charity sketches in order to cover John Ostrander&#x27;s eye surgery. CBR&#x27;s Brian Cronin also defended Lee&#x27;s prices, which he argued were proportionate to the limits placed on his drawing time by his role as DC Comics President, and the level of esteem and demand placed on Lee&#x27;s art by his status as one of the top artists of all time, much in the same that any business in a free market calculated prices and discounts based on demand. Underscoring this latter point, Cronin observed that Lee was one of only two artists, along with Alex Ross, who had placed in the top five of CBR&#x27;s 2022 Master Artists List, who were still actively producing comics art. Cronin also pointed out that Lee&#x27;s art was often re-sold on the secondary market for similar prices, making that pricing on the part of Lee and his agent reasonable. In addition, Cronin stated that Lee did considerable charity work, calling into question the notion that the prices were motivated by greed. Cronin viewed this criticism as part of the broader practice on the part of the public of devaluing the work of illustrators, arguing that such criticism was not leveled at celebrities who charged fans hundreds of dollars for photo-ops and autographs at fan conventions.

==Personal life==
Lee is married to Carla Michelle Lee. In 2012, when Carla was pregnant, Lee included a tribute to her in &quot;Justice League&quot; #5, writing &quot;I LOVE CARLA&quot; on the shattered windshield of a car onto which Batman jumps. As of November 2016, they had nine children, ages 2 to 23.

In the 1990s, Lee bought two pages of Jack Kirby concept art, which Kirby had created for a film adaptation of Roger Zelazny&#x27;s novel &quot;Lord of Light&quot;, as part of the cover story to smuggle Americans out of Iran during the 1980 hostage crisis. Lee purchased the art at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction via Barry Geller, the producer of the faux film, who was selling it to help pay for his child&#x27;s college tuition. The CIA operation that rescued the Americans remained classified for another 17 years, and thus Lee had no idea of the pages&#x27; historical significance, nor did Geller know their true monetary value when he sold them to help pay his son&#x27;s college tuition (with Kirby&#x27;s permission). Both Lee and Geller learned of the true story behind the art years later with the rest of the public. In August 2013, four of Lee&#x27;s children were headed for college, and he and Carla decided to auction off the art through Heritage Auctions in order to pay for their education.

Outside of fan conventions, Lee enjoys traveling and learning new languages. In addition to English and Italian, he speaks some German. He also enjoys scuba diving on occasion.

<text>In mathematics and the field of number theory, the Landau‚ÄìRamanujan constant is the positive real number &quot;b&quot; that occurs in a theorem proved by Edmund Landau in 1908, stating that for large formula_1, the number of positive integers below formula_1 that are the sum of two square numbers behaves asymptotically as

:formula_3

This constant &quot;b&quot; was rediscovered in 1913 by Srinivasa Ramanujan, in the first letter he wrote to G.H. Hardy.

==Sums of two squares==
By the sum of two squares theorem, the numbers that can be expressed as a sum of two squares of integers are the ones for which each prime number congruent to 3 mod 4 appears with an even exponent in their prime factorization. For instance, &quot;45 = 9 + 36&quot; is a sum of two squares; in its prime factorization, 32¬†√ó¬†5, the prime 3 appears with an even exponent, and the prime 5 is congruent to 1 mod 4, so its exponent can be odd.

Landau&#x27;s theorem states that if formula_4 is the number of positive integers less than formula_1 that are the sum of two squares, then
:formula_6 ,
where formula_7 is the Landau‚ÄìRamanujan constant.

The Landau-Ramanujan constant can also be written as an infinite product:

formula_8

==History==
This constant was stated by Landau in the limit form above; Ramanujan instead approximated formula_4 as an integral, with the same constant of proportionality, and with a slowly growing error term.

<doc id="620718" wikidata="Q482511" url="?curid=620718" title="M79 grenade launcher">
<text>The M79 grenade launcher is a single-shot, shoulder-fired, break-action grenade launcher that fires a 40√ó46mm grenade, which uses what the US Army calls the High-Low Propulsion System to keep recoil forces low, and first appeared during the Vietnam War. Its distinctive report has earned it colorful nicknames, such as &quot;Thumper&quot;, &quot;Thump-Gun&quot;, &quot;Bloop Tube&quot;, &quot;Big Ed&quot;, &quot;Elephant Gun&quot;, and &quot;Blooper&quot; among American soldiers as well as &quot;Can Cannon&quot; in reference to the grenade size; Australian units referred to it as the &quot;Wombat Gun&quot;. The M79 can fire a wide variety of 40¬†mm rounds, including explosive, anti-personnel, smoke, buckshot, flechette (pointed steel projectiles with a vaned tail for stable flight), and illumination. While largely replaced by the M203, the M79 has remained in service in many units worldwide in niche roles.

==History==
The M79 was a result of the US Army&#x27;s Project Niblick, an attempt to increase firepower for the infantryman by having an explosive projectile more accurate with further range than rifle grenades, but more portable than a mortar. Project Niblick created the 40¬†x¬†46¬†mm grenade, but was unable to create a satisfactory launcher for it that could fire more than a single shot. One of the launchers at Springfield Armory was the three-shot &quot;harmonica&quot; T148 (not to be confused with the later, underbarrel XM148), which did see some limited production and fielding in Vietnam, but problems with the three-round magazine prevented widespread acceptance. The other design was a single-shot break-open, shoulder-fired weapon, the S-3. This was refined into the S-5, which resembled an oversized single-barrel shotgun. Unable to solve the problems with the multi-shot T148 launcher, the Army adopted the S-5 as the XM79. With a new sight, the XM79 was officially adopted as the M79 on December 15, 1960.

In 1961, the first M79 grenade launchers were delivered to the US Army. Owing to its ease of use, reliability, and firepower, the M79 became popular among American soldiers, who dubbed it &quot;the platoon leader&#x27;s artillery&quot;. Some soldiers would cut down the stock and barrel to make the M79 even more portable.
The M79 saw combat in the Vietnam War beginning in the early days, when M79 Grenadiers assigned to major Army divisions first arrived to see combat in Vietnam in 1965, including the 1st Cavalry Division, the 1st Infantry Division, the 101st Airborne Division, and the 173rd Airborne Brigade. M79s were assigned to the specialist 4 grenadier in both 4-5-man fire teams organic to an Army rifle squad headed by a squad leader. The Marines assigned one grenadier to their three-fireteam 14-man rifle squad.

However, its single-shot nature was a serious drawback. Reloading after every shot meant a slow rate of fire and an inability to keep up a constant volume of fire during a firefight. This led the Navy to develop the China Lake Grenade Launcher, which was produced for deployed SEAL Teams. For close-in situations, the minimum arming range (the round travels 30 meters to arm itself) and the blast radius meant a grenadier had to use his .45 ACP (11.43¬†mm) M1911 pistol, or fire and hope that the grenade acted as a giant slow bullet. Special grenades for close-in fighting were created to compensate, though a soldier was not always able to load one in the heat of battle. Moreover, the size/weight of both the M79 and its ammunition meant that a grenadier armed with this weapon could not also carry a rifle, having only a sidearm to use in a firefight after expending his rounds. Some grenadiers did choose to carry a slung M16 rifle in lieu of a sidearm.

Underbarrel grenade launchers, such as the XM148 and the M203, both designed as attachments for the M16 rifle, were developed during the Vietnam War, allowing the grenadier to also function as a rifleman. The XM148 was plagued with problems and the project was dropped. The M203 was however a success, and was standardized in 1969; it had replaced the M79 by the end of the war, though M79s were still used in Reserve and National Guard units.

Some US Navy SEALs and Army Special Forces in Iraq have been seen using the M79 in recent years, due to its greater accuracy and range compared to the M203 (350 meters effective versus 150 meters effective). The M79 has seen notable limited use during Operation Iraqi Freedom, such as for clearing IEDs. The grenade launcher also sees continued use as a mission-specific tool with Special warfare combatant-craft crewmen.

==Design==

Visually, the M79 grenade launcher resembles a large bore, break-action, sawed-off shotgun, and is simple in design, having only five major parts: a receiver group, a fore-end assembly, a barrel group, a sight assembly, and a stock. The fore-end assembly beds the barrel to the receiver. The stock is made out of wood or fiberglass. A rubber pad affixed to the buttstock absorbs some recoil. The front sight is a fixed blade. The rear sight on the M79 is a folding ladder‚Äìstyle leaf sight. When folded, the leaf sight acts as a fixed sight at close range. A grenadier may simply point and shoot with high accuracy. When unfolded, the leaf sight can be adjusted for ranges from 75 to 375 meters, in 25-meter increments. Additionally, Appendix A of the U.S. Army field manual for the M203 includes instructions on attaching the M16 rifle grenade sight to the M79&#x27;s stock and marking the sling for indirect fire at elevations greater than 40¬∞.

While not manufacturers of the M79, Milcor and Denel Mechem of South Africa do re-manufacture M-79 grenade launchers to more modern standards. They replace the leaf sight with an optical one and replace the wooden stock with a modified R-4/R-5 stock.

==Operation==
The M79 is easy to operate. To load, the grenadier pushes the barrel locking latch on the receiver group to the right. Gravity will pull down the barrel, opening the action and exposing the breech. The hammer is cocked when the breech is opened, and a spent casing may then be removed (if present) and a new round loaded. The break action must then be closed manually. Closing the breech will cause the barrel locking latch to return to center. The safety must then be pushed to the forward position in order to ready the weapon for firing.

==Ammunition==
Many different ammunition types were produced for the M79 (and subsequently for the M203). Outside of the smoke and illumination rounds three main types emerge: explosive, close-range, and non-lethal crowd control. The break-open action of the M79 allows it to use longer rounds that the standard M203 cannot use without some difficulty.

===Explosive===
The M406 40¬†mm HE (high explosive) grenades fired from the M79 travel at a muzzle velocity of 75 meters per second. The M406 contained enough explosive to produce over 300 fragments that travel at 1,524 meters per second within a lethal radius of 5 meters. This round incorporated a spin-activation safety feature which prevents the grenade from arming while still within range of the shooter; it armed itself after traveling a distance of about 14‚Äì27 meters. The round would not arm at point blank ranges and it usually did not have enough kinetic energy to kill, although it sometimes penetrated the abdomen or caused large hematomas.

===Close range===

For close range fighting, two styles of M79 rounds were developed. The first was a flechette or Bee Hive round (so named for the sound the flechettes made while in flight) that fired 45 10-grain steel flechettes. Flechettes proved to be ineffective because they would often not hit point-first and penetrate. Instead they would hit sideways and bounce off. About 1966, this was replaced by the M576 buckshot round. Containing twenty 24-grain metal pellets (M576E1) or twenty-seven 24-grain metal pellets (M576E2), this round could be devastating at close ranges. However, as range increased, the shot spread out so rapidly as to be ineffective. The M576E2, despite the greater number of shot, was less effective at range than the M576E1, because its shot spread out much more quickly and could completely miss the target.

===Non-lethal===
The M79 has been used extensively also for crowd control purposes where it is desirable to have a weapon dedicated solely to non-lethal force. The three common less-lethal rounds are the M651 CS gas, the M1006 sponge grenade, and the M1029 Crowd Dispersal rounds.

<text>In the United States, state law refers to the law of each separate U.S. state.

The fifty states are separate sovereigns, with their own state constitutions, state governments, and state courts. All states have a legislative branch which enacts state statutes, an executive branch that promulgates state regulations pursuant to statutory authorization, and a judicial branch that applies, interprets, and occasionally overturns both state statutes and regulations, as well as local ordinances. States retain the power to make laws covering anything not otherwise preempted by the federal Constitution, federal statutes, or international treaties ratified by the federal Senate. Normally, state supreme courts are the final interpreters of state institutions and state law, unless their interpretation itself presents a federal issue, in which case a decision may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court by way of a petition for writ of &quot;certiorari&quot;. State courts regularly have concurrent jurisdiction with federal courts and, where applicable, apply or are also bound by federal law. State laws have dramatically diverged in the centuries since independence, to the extent that the United States cannot be regarded as one legal system (as to the majority of types of law traditionally under state control), but instead as 50 &quot;separate&quot; systems of tort law, family law, property law, contract law, criminal law, and so on. Nonetheless developments in the law in one state may influence the development of law in other states.

In the United States, most cases are litigated in state courts and involve claims and defenses under state laws. In a 2018 report, the National Center for State Courts&#x27; Court Statistics Project found that state trial courts received 83.8¬†million newly filed cases in 2018, which consisted of 44.4¬†million traffic cases, 17.0¬†million criminal cases, 16.4¬†million civil cases, 4.7¬†million domestic relations cases, and 1.2¬†million juvenile cases. In 2018, state appellate courts received 234,000 new cases (appeals). By way of comparison, all federal district courts in 2016 together received only about 274,552 new civil cases, 79,787 new criminal cases, and 833,515 bankruptcy cases, while federal appellate courts received 53,649 new cases (appeals).

==Interstate diversity==
The law of most of the states is based on the common law of England; the notable exception is Louisiana, whose civil law is largely based upon French and Spanish law. The passage of time has led to state courts and legislatures expanding, overruling, or modifying the common law; as a result, the laws of any given state invariably differ from the laws of its sister states. Thus, as noted above, the U.S. must be regarded as 50 &quot;separate&quot; systems of tort law, family law, property law, contract law, criminal law, and so on. (In addition, the District of Columbia and the federal territories also have their own separate legal systems analogous to state legal systems, although they do not enjoy state sovereignty.)

A typical example of the diversity of contemporary state law is the legal test for finding a duty of care, the first element required to proceed with a lawsuit for negligence (the basis for most personal injury lawsuits). A 2011 article found that 43 states use a multifactor balancing test usually consisting of four to eight factors, but there are 23 various incarnations because so few states use exactly the same test, and consolidating those into a single list results in 42 unique factors. Naturally, the laws of different states frequently come into conflict with each other, which has given rise to a huge body of law regulating the conflict of laws in the United States. As of the mid-2010s, American federal and state courts were deciding around 5,000 conflict-of-laws cases each year‚Äîfar more than in any other country or even any other continent. 

The diversity of U.S. state law first became a notable problem during the late 19th-century era known as the Gilded Age, when interstate commerce was nurtured by then-novel technologies like the telegraph, the telephone, the steamship, and the railroad. Many lawyers during the Gilded Age complained about how the diversity and volume of state law hampered interstate trade and introduced complexity and inconvenience into virtually any interstate transaction (commercial or otherwise). This widespread frustration was evident at the founding of the American Bar Association in 1878; one of the ABA&#x27;s original founding purposes was to promote &quot;uniformity of legislation throughout the Union.&quot; There have been three major reactions to this problem, none of which were completely successful: codification, uniform acts, and the Restatements.

==Codification==
The United States, with the exception of Louisiana, originally inherited a common law system in which the law was not organized and restated such that it could be identified as (1) relevant to a particular legal question and (2) currently in force. The process of organizing the law, called codification, was borrowed from the civil law through the efforts of American lawyer David Dudley Field. Field, in turn, was building upon early (but wholly unsuccessful) foundational work by the English legal philosopher Jeremy Bentham, who actually coined the verb &quot;to codify&quot; for the process of drafting a legal code. The earliest attempt at codification occurred in Massachusetts with a 1648 publication.

Naturally, there is much diversity in the structure of the state codes, reflecting the diversity of the statutory law on which they were built. New York&#x27;s codes are known as &quot;Laws&quot;. California and Texas simply call them &quot;Codes&quot;. Other states use terms such as &quot;Code of [state name]&quot;, &quot;Revised Statutes&quot;, or &quot;Compiled Statutes&quot; for their compilations. California, New York, and Texas use separate subject-specific codes; Maryland&#x27;s code has, as of 2016, been completely recodified from numbered articles into named articles; virtually all other states and the federal government use a single code divided into numbered titles or other top-level divisions. Louisiana is a unique hybrid in that it has five subject-specific codes and a set of Revised Statutes for everything else. A poorly drafted 1864 anti-corruption amendment to Pennsylvania&#x27;s constitution prevented its legislature from starting comprehensive codification until 1970 (after the state constitution was finally amended to add the necessary exception in 1967).

The advantage of codification is that once the state legislature becomes accustomed to writing new laws as amendments to an existing code, the code will usually reflect democratic sentiment as to what the current law is (though the entire state of the law must always be ascertained by reviewing case law to determine how judges have interpreted a particular codified statute).

In contrast, in jurisdictions with uncodified statutes, like the United Kingdom, determining what the law is can be a more difficult process. One has to trace back to the earliest relevant Act of Parliament, and then identify all later Acts which either amended the earlier Act or expressly or impliedly repealed it. For example, when the UK decided to create a Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, lawmakers had to identify every single Act referring to the House of Lords that was still good law, and then amend all of those laws to refer to the Supreme Court.

In most U.S. states, certain areas of the law, especially the law of contracts and torts, continue to exist primarily in the form of case law, subject only to limited statutory modifications and refinements. Thus, for example, there is no statute in most states which one can consult for answers on basic issues like the essential elements of a contract. Rather, one must consult case law, with all the complexity and difficulty that implies.

Major exceptions include the states of California, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota as well as the territory of Guam, all of which largely enacted Field&#x27;s proposed civil code even though it was repeatedly rejected and never enacted by his home state of New York. Idaho partially enacted the contract portions of Field&#x27;s civil code but omitted the tort sections. Georgia initiated its own full codification independent of Field, which resulted in the enactment of the oldest ancestor of the modern Official Code of Georgia Annotated in 1861. As Field belatedly conceded in an 1889 article, Georgia&#x27;s code was enacted before his civil code, but he was unaware of the Georgia codification project because of the breakdown in interstate communications that preceded the American Civil War. 

In some states, codification is often treated as a mere of the common law, to the extent that the subject matter of the particular statute at issue was covered by some judge-made principle at common law. California is notorious for a confused approach to the interpretation and application of codified statutes: &quot;California judges wandered between expansive construction and traditional strict construction, lingering at every point in between‚Äîsometimes all in the course of the same opinion.&quot; In other states, there is a tradition of strict adherence to the plain text of the codes.

==Uniform acts==

Efforts by various organizations to create uniform acts to be adopted by multiple states have been made but only partially successful. The two leading organizations are the American Law Institute (ALI) and the Uniform Law Commission (ULC), formerly known as the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL).

Uniform acts are proposed by private organizations like ULC to cover areas of law traditionally governed by the states where it would be useful to have a consistent set of rules across the various states. 
The most successful and influential uniform acts are the Uniform Commercial Code (a joint ALI-ULC project) and the Model Penal Code (from ALI).

However, uniform acts can only become the law of a state if they are actually enacted by the state legislature. Many uniform acts have never been taken up by state legislatures, or were successfully enacted in only a handful of states, or enacted in part, thereby limiting their uniformity function.

==Restatements==

Upon its founding in 1923, ALI promptly launched its most ambitious and well-known enterprise: the creation of Restatements of the Law which are widely used by lawyers and judges throughout the United States to simplify the task of identifying and summarizing the current status of the common law. Instead of listing long, tedious citations of old cases that may not fit very well together (in order to invoke the long-established principles supposedly contained in those cases), or citing a treatise which may reflect the view of only one or two authors, they can simply cite a Restatement section (which is supposed to reflect the consensus of the American legal community) to refer to a particular common law principle.

The Restatements are often followed by state courts on issues of first impression in a particular state because they correctly state the current trend followed by most states on that issue. However, the Restatements are merely persuasive authority. This means that state courts (especially at the appellate level) can and have deviated from Restatement positions on a variety of issues.

==Civil law issues==

Much of Louisiana law is derived from French and Spanish civil law, which stems from its history as a colony of both France and Spain. Puerto Rico, a former Spanish colony, is also a civil law jurisdiction of the United States. However, the criminal law of both jurisdictions has been necessarily modified by common law influences and the supremacy of the federal Constitution.

Furthermore, Puerto Rico is also unique in that it is the only U.S. jurisdiction in which the everyday working language of court proceedings, statutes, regulations, and case law is Spanish. All states, the federal government, and most territories use American English as their working language. Some states, such as California, do provide certain court forms in other languages (Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Vietnamese) for the convenience of immigrants and naturalized citizens. But American law as developed through statutes, regulations, and case law is always in English, attorneys are expected to take and pass the bar examination in English, judges hear oral argument, supervise trials, and issue orders from the bench in English, and testimony and documents originating in other languages are translated into English before being incorporated into the official record of a case.

Many states in the southwest that were originally Mexican territory have inherited several unique features from the civil law that governed when they were part of Mexico. These states include Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas. For example, these states all have a community property system for the property of married persons (Idaho, Washington, and Wisconsin have also adopted community property systems, but they did not inherit them from a previous civil law system that governed the state). Another example of civil law influence in these states can be seen in the California Civil Code, where the law of contracts is treated as part of the law of obligations.

Many of the western states, including California, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and Wyoming use a system of allocating water rights known as the prior appropriation doctrine, which is derived from Spanish civil law. Each state has modified the doctrine to suit its own internal conditions and needs.

<text>The Weston A. Price Foundation (WAPF), co-founded in 1999 by Sally Fallon (Morell) and nutritionist Mary G. Enig, is a U.S.¬†501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to &quot;restoring nutrient-dense foods to the American diet through education, research and activism&quot;.

The foundation has been criticized for spreading medical misinformation and dangerous health advice. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned about its advocacy of drinking raw milk and various nutritionists, including Joel Fuhrman, were concerned about its advocacy of the health benefits of animal-based fats.

==Weston A. Price==

Price was a dentist from Cleveland, Ohio, whose 1939 book, &quot;Nutrition and Physical Degeneration&quot;, describes the fieldwork he did in the 1920s and 1930s among various world cultures, with the original goal of recording and studying the dental health and development of pre-industrial populations.

==Organization==
The president of the foundation is Sally Fallon Morell. According to the WAPF, she received a B.A. in English from Stanford University and an M.A. in English from UCLA.

The foundation has seven board members and numerous honorary board members, most of whom have medical or nutritional qualifications. In 2010, its membership numbered 13,000 and was growing at an annual rate of 10%, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

Its main sources of support are the dues and contributions of its members. It does not receive funding from the government or the food processing and agribusiness industries. It does accept sponsorships, exhibitors and advertising from small companies by invitation, whose products are in line with its principles. The sponsors include grass-fed meat and wild fish producers, as well as health product companies.

A 2004 report published by the foundation stated that it is dedicated to &quot;restoring nutrient-dense foods to the American diet through education, research and activism&quot;, and &quot;supports a number of movements that contribute to this objective including accurate nutrition instruction, organic and biodynamic farming, pasture feeding of livestock, community-supported farms, honest and informative labeling, prepared parenting and nurturing therapies.&quot;

Specific goals include establishment of universal access to certified raw milk and a ban on the use of soy in infant formulas. The organization actively lobbies in Washington, D.C., on issues such as government dietary guidelines and school lunch programs.

==Dietary recommendations==
The foundation&#x27;s recommendations include the consumption of unprocessed or minimally processed foods including: traditional fats (olive oil, cod liver oil, and animal fats such as lard and tallow, etc.), organic fruits and vegetables, raw dairy products, soured or lacto-fermented dairy and vegetables (such as sauerkraut), whole grains (soaked or soured to neutralize their phytic acid, lectins, and other anti-nutrients), and bone stocks.

WAPF publications regularly speak out against marijuana/cannabis and other drugs as harmful and addictive.

=== Lipid hypothesis ===

The Weston A. Price Foundation is known for its controversial position against the lipid hypothesis, maintaining a positive stance towards the consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol from traditional foods.

=== Criticism ===
The anti-vegetarian and anti-soy views of the foundation have been criticized as &quot;myths&quot; in several publications, for example, Quackwatch describes the foundation as promoting &quot;questionable dietary strategies&quot; and Price&#x27;s core assumptions as contrary to contemporary medical understanding, and &quot;Science-Based Medicine&quot; evaluated the medical and nutritional claims of the Weston A. Price Foundation and concludes the website is &quot;one of the worst on the internet&quot; due to misleading and false information.

Similarly, John Robbins reviewed the history of the Weston A. Price Foundation and provided evidence that Weston A. Price recommended a vegetarian and dairy diet to his own family members.

Joel Fuhrman has written a series of articles entitled &quot;The truth about the Weston Price foundation&quot; in which he argues the foundation is a purveyor of &quot;nutritional myths&quot;, largely because they have failed to update their recommendations in light of contradictory evidence and criticizes advocacy of the health benefits of animal-based fats.

==Activism==
The Weston A. Price Foundation is a lobbying group that seeks to ban infant soy formula and advocates a nutrient-dense diet of whole foods, including animal fats. Board of Directors member Kaayla Daniel has released a book titled: &quot;The Whole Soy Story: The Dark Side of America&#x27;s Favorite Health Food&quot;.

The foundation is an advocate for the consumption of unpasteurized milk, or raw milk, in what is known as the United States raw milk debate. One of its goals is to remove health regulations requiring pasteurization of milk products, so that raw milk can be legally purchased in all states. Supporters of this campaign believe pasteurization removes or destroys beneficial parts of raw milk, leading to a less healthy product that is associated with numerous diseases, however, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Food and Drug Administration disagree with this, noting that the pasteurization process &quot;does not significantly change the nutritional value of milk&quot; and that consumption of raw milk poses a &quot;severe health risk&quot;. They point out that prior to the widespread use of pasteurization many diseases were commonly transmitted by raw milk, while by 2005 they made up less than 1% of food and water contamination disease outbreaks. The director of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Division of Plant- and Dairy-Food Safety, John Sheehan, called the organization&#x27;s claims on the health benefits and safety of raw milk &quot;false, devoid of scientific support, and misleading to consumers&quot;.

The organization also supports local food and farms. Established with the help of the foundation in July 2007, the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund aims to protect the rights of farmers to provide meat, eggs, raw dairy products, vegetables and other foods directly to consumers. This includes protecting consumers&#x27; &quot;freedom of choice to consume raw milk,&quot; according to Pete Kennedy, president of the Fund. In the first year of its operation, it raised over $350,000 and receives around three requests for assistance per week from farmers in the United States facing legal or bureaucratic challenges in relation to sales of raw milk.

Weston A. Price Foundation, by way of founder Sally Fallon and regular contributor Andrew Kaufman, has published articles in its house journal &quot;Wise Traditions&quot; that call into question established science about COVID-19, specifically that it is a virus at all, that vaccines are beneficial if not outright deadly, and theories about origins in 5G network radiation.

<text>Qu Yuan (¬†‚Äì 278¬†BC) was a Chinese poet and aristocrat in the State of Chu during the Warring States period. He is known for his patriotism and contributions to classical poetry and verses, especially through the poems of the &quot;Chu Ci&quot; anthology (also known as &quot;The Songs of the South&quot; or &quot;Songs of Chu&quot;): a volume of poems attributed to or considered to be inspired by his verse writing. Together with the &quot;Shi Jing&quot;, the &quot;Chu Ci&quot; is one of the two greatest collections of ancient Chinese verse. He is also remembered in connection to the supposed origin of the Dragon Boat Festival.

Historical details about Qu Yuan&#x27;s life are few, and his authorship of many &quot;Chu Ci&quot; poems has been questioned at length. However, he is widely accepted to have written &quot;The Lament,&quot; a &quot;Chu Ci&quot; poem. The first known reference to Qu Yuan appears in a poem written in 174 BC by Jia Yi, an official from Luoyang who was slandered by jealous officials and banished to Changsha by Emperor Wen of Han. While traveling, he wrote a poem describing the similar fate of a previous &quot;Qu Yuan.&quot; Eighty years later, the first known biography of Qu Yuan&#x27;s life appeared in Han dynasty historian Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, though it contains a number of contradictory details.

==Life==
The only surviving source of information on Qu Yuan&#x27;s life is Sima Qian&#x27;s biography of him in &quot;Shiji&quot;, although the biography is circumstantial and probably influenced greatly by Sima&#x27;s own identification with Qu. Sima wrote that Qu was a member of the Chu royal clan and served as an official under King Huai of Chu (reigned 328‚Äì299 BC).

During the early days of King Huai&#x27;s reign, Qu Yuan was serving the State of Chu as its Left Minister. However, King Huai exiled Qu Yuan to the region north of the Han River, because corrupt ministers slandered him and influenced the king. Eventually, Qu Yuan was reinstated and sent on a diplomatic mission to the State of Qi. He tried to resume relations between Chu and Qi, which King Huai had broken under the false pretense of King Hui of Qin to cede territory near Shangyu.

During King Qingxiang&#x27;s reign, Prime Minister Zilan slandered Qu Yuan. This caused Qu Yuan&#x27;s exile to the regions south of the Yangtze River. It is said that Qu Yuan returned first to his home town. In his exile, he spent much of this time collecting legends and rearranging folk odes while traveling the countryside. Furthermore, he wrote some of the greatest poetry in Chinese literature and expressed deep concerns about his state. According to legend, his anxiety brought him to an increasingly troubled state of health. During his depression, he would often take walks near a certain well to look upon his thin and gaunt reflection in the water. This well became known as the &quot;Face Reflection Well.&quot; On a hillside in Xiangluping (at present-day Zigui County, Hubei Province), there is a well that is considered to be the original well from the time of Qu Yuan.

In 278 BC, learning of the capture of his country&#x27;s capital, Ying, by General Bai Qi of the state of Qin, Qu Yuan is said to have collected folktales and written the lengthy poem of lamentation called &quot;Lament for Ying&quot;. Eventually, he died by suicide, wading into the Miluo River in today&#x27;s Hunan Province while holding a rock. Why he chose death was argued by Chinese scholars for centuries. Typical explanations included martyrdom for his beloved but falling motherland ‚Äì suggested by Song dynasty philosopher Zhu Xi ‚Äì or extreme despair of the political in Chu, realizing his lifelong political dream would never be achieved. But according to &quot;Yu Fu&quot;, widely considered to be written by Qu himself or a person very familiar with him, suicide was an ultimate way to protect his innocence and life principles.

According to Li Yinhe, Qu Yuan is said to have expressed his love for the ruling monarch, King Huai of Chu, through several of this works, including the &quot;Li Sao&quot; and &quot;Longing for Beauty&quot;.

==Legacy==

Qu Yuan is regarded as the first author of verse in China to have his name associated to his work, since prior to that time, poetic works were not attributed to any specific authors. He is considered to have initiated the so-called &quot;sao&quot; style of verse, which is named after his work &quot;Li Sao&quot;, in which he abandoned the classic four-character verses used in poems of &quot;Shi Jing&quot; and adopted verses with varying lengths. This resulted in poems with more rhythm and latitude in expression. Qu Yuan is also regarded as one of the most prominent figures of Romanticism in Chinese classical literature, and his masterpieces influenced some of the great Romanticist poets in the Tang dynasty. During the Han dynasty, Qu Yuan became established as a heroic example of model behaviour for a scholar-official denied public recognition suitable to their worth.

===&quot;Chu Ci&quot;===
Chu was located in what is now the Yangzi River area of central China. At this time, Chu represented the southern fringe of the Chinese cultural area, having been at times an ally, opponent, or subunit of the Shang and Zhou kingdoms. However, the Chu culture also retained certain characteristics of local traditions such as shamanism, the influence of which can be seen in the &quot;Chu Ci&quot;.

The &quot;Chu Ci&quot; was compiled and annotated by Wang Yi (died AD 158), and is the source of transmission of these poems and any reliable information about them to subsequent times; thus, the role which Qu Yuan had in the authoring, editing, or retouching of these works remains unclear. The &quot;Chu Ci&quot; poems are important as being direct precursors of the &quot;fu style&quot; of Han dynasty literature. The &quot;Chu Ci&quot;, as a preservation of early literature, has provided invaluable data for linguistic research into the history of the Chinese language, from Chen Di on.

===Religion===
Following his suicide, Qu Yuan was sometimes revered as a water god, including by Taiwanese Taoists, who number him among the Kings of the Water Immortals.

===Patriotism===
Qu Yuan began to be treated in a nationalist way as &quot;China&#x27;s first patriotic poet&quot; during World War II. Wen Yiduo‚Äîa socialist poet and scholar later executed by the Chinese Nationalist Party‚Äîwrote in his &quot;Mythology &amp; Poetry&quot; that, &quot;although Qu Yuan did not write about the life of the people or voice their sufferings, he may truthfully be said to have acted as the leader of a people&#x27;s revolution and to have struck a blow to avenge them. Qu Yuan is the only person in the whole of Chinese history who is fully entitled to be called &#x27;the people&#x27;s poet&#x27;.&quot; Guo Moruo&#x27;s 1942 play &quot;Qu Yuan&quot; gave him similar treatment, drawing parallels to &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot;. Their view of Qu&#x27;s social idealism and unbending patriotism became canonical under the People&#x27;s Republic of China after the 1949 Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War. For example, one high-school Chinese textbook from 1957 began with the sentence &quot;Qu Yuan was the first great patriotic poet in the history of our country&#x27;s literature&quot;. This cult status increased Qu Yuan&#x27;s position within China&#x27;s literary canon, seeing him placed on postage stamps and the Dragon Boat Festival elevated to a national public holiday in 2008. It has, however, come at the expense of more the critical scholarly appraisals of Qu Yuan&#x27;s historicity and alleged body of work that had developed during the late Qing and early Republic.

===Dragon Boat Festival===
Popular legend has it that villagers carried their dumplings and boats to the middle of the river and desperately tried to save Qu Yuan after he immersed himself in the Miluo but were too late to do so. However, in order to keep fish and evil spirits away from his body, they beat drums and splashed the water with their paddles, and they also threw rice into the water both as a food offering to Qu Yuan&#x27;s spirit and also to distract the fish away from his body. However, the legend continues, that late one night, the spirit of Qu Yuan appeared before his friends and told them that he died because he had taken himself under the river. Then, he asked his friends to wrap their rice into three-cornered silk packages to ward off the dragon.

These packages became a traditional food known as &quot;zongzi&quot;, although the lumps of rice are now wrapped in leaves instead of silk. The act of racing to search for his body in boats gradually became the cultural tradition of dragon boat racing, held on the anniversary of his death every year. Today, people still eat &quot;zongzi&quot; and participate in dragon boat races to commemorate Qu Yuan&#x27;s sacrifice on the fifth day of the fifth month of the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar. The countries around China, such as Vietnam and Korea, also celebrate variations of this Dragon Boat Festival as part of their shared cultural heritage.

===Space Exploration===
China&#x27;s interplanetary exploration program, Tianwen (Heavenly Questions) is named after a poem by Qu Yuan. The first mission to Mars, Tianwen-1, was launched on July 23, 2020, and reached Mars on February 10, 2021. On Mar 14, 2021, the lander and rover successfully landed on the surface of Mars.

<doc id="620746" wikidata="Q23808" url="?curid=620746" title="Interface (computing)">
<text>In computing, an interface is a shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer system exchange information. The exchange can be between software, computer hardware, peripheral devices, humans, and combinations of these. Some computer hardware devices, such as a touchscreen, can both send and receive data through the interface, while others such as a mouse or microphone may only provide an interface to send data to a given system.

== Hardware interfaces ==
Hardware interfaces exist in many components, such as the various buses, storage devices, other I/O devices, etc. A hardware interface is described by the mechanical, electrical, and logical signals at the interface and the protocol for sequencing them (sometimes called signaling). A standard interface, such as SCSI, decouples the design and introduction of computing hardware, such as I/O devices, from the design and introduction of other components of a computing system, thereby allowing users and manufacturers great flexibility in the implementation of computing systems. Hardware interfaces can be parallel with several electrical connections carrying parts of the data simultaneously or serial where data are sent one bit at a time.

== Software interfaces ==
A software interface may refer to a wide range of different types of interfaces at different &quot;levels&quot;. For example, an operating system may interface with pieces of hardware. Applications or programs running on the operating system may need to interact via data streams, filters, and pipelines. In object oriented programs, objects within an application may need to interact via methods.

=== In practice ===
A key principle of design is to prohibit access to all resources by default, allowing access only through well-defined entry points, i.e., interfaces. Software interfaces provide access to computer resources (such as memory, CPU, storage, etc.) of the underlying computer system; direct access (i.e., not through well-designed interfaces) to such resources by software can have major ramifications‚Äîsometimes disastrous ones‚Äîfor functionality and stability.

Interfaces between software components can provide constants, data types, types of procedures, exception specifications, and method signatures. Sometimes, public variables are also defined as part of an interface.

The interface of a software module &quot;A&quot; is deliberately defined separately from the implementation of that module. The latter contains the actual code of the procedures and methods described in the interface, as well as other &quot;private&quot; variables, procedures, etc. Another software module &quot;B&quot;, for example the client to &quot;A&quot;, that interacts with &quot;A&quot; is forced to do so only through the published interface. One practical advantage of this arrangement is that replacing the implementation of &quot;A&quot; with another implementation of the same interface should not cause &quot;B&quot; to fail‚Äîhow &quot;A&quot; internally meets the requirements of the interface is not relevant to &quot;B&quot;, which is only concerned with the specifications of the interface. (See also Liskov substitution principle.)

=== In object-oriented languages ===

In some object-oriented languages, especially those without full multiple inheritance, the term &quot;interface&quot; is used to define an abstract type that acts as an abstraction of a class. It contains no data, but defines behaviours as method signatures. A class having code and data for all the methods corresponding to that interface and declaring so is said to &quot;implement&quot; that interface. Furthermore, even in single-inheritance-languages, one can implement multiple interfaces, and hence can &quot;be&quot; of different types at the same time.

An interface is thus a type definition; anywhere an object can be exchanged (for example, in a function or method call) the &quot;type&quot; of the object to be exchanged can be defined in terms of one of its implemented &quot;interface&quot;s or base-classes rather than specifying the specific class. This approach means that any class that implements that interface can be used. For example, a dummy implementation may be used to allow development to progress before the final implementation is available. In another case, a fake or mock implementation may be substituted during testing. Such stub implementations are replaced by real code later in the development process.

Usually, a method defined in an interface contains no code and thus cannot itself be called; it must be implemented by non-abstract code to be run when it is invoked. An interface called &quot;codice_1&quot; might define two methods: codice_2 and codice_3. It can be implemented in different ways, for example, codice_4 and codice_5‚Äîthe first being fast, working with a data structure of fixed size, and the second using a data structure that can be resized, but at the cost of somewhat lower speed.

Though interfaces can contain many methods, they may contain only one or even none at all. For example, the Java language defines the interface that has the single method; various implementations are used for different purposes, including , , , , and . Marker interfaces like contain no methods at all and serve to provide run-time information to generic processing using Reflection.

=== Programming to the interface ===
The use of interfaces allows for a programming style called &quot;programming to the interface&quot;. The idea behind this approach is to base programming logic on the interfaces of the objects used, rather than on internal implementation details. Programming to the interface reduces dependency on implementation specifics and makes code more reusable.

Pushing this idea to the extreme, inversion of control leaves the &quot;context&quot; to inject the code with the specific implementations of the interface that will be used to perform the work.

== User interfaces ==
A user interface is a point of interaction between a computer and humans; it includes any number of modalities of interaction (such as graphics, sound, position, movement, etc.) where data is transferred between the user and the computer system.

<text>Ndabaningi Sithole (21 July 1920 ‚Äì 12 December 2000) was a Zimbabwean politician and statesman who was the founder of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), a militant, nationalist organisation that opposed the government of Rhodesia, in July 1963. He worked as a United Church of Christ in Zimbabwe (UCCZ) minister. He spent 10 years in prison after the government banned ZANU. A rift along tribal lines split ZANU in 1975, and he lost the 1980 elections to Robert Mugabe.

==Early life==
Sithole was born in Nyamandlovu, Southern Rhodesia, on 21 July 1920. Sithole&#x27;s father was Ndau and his mother was Ndebele. He studied teaching in the United States from 1955 to 1958, and was ordained a Methodist minister in 1958. The publication of his book &quot;African Nationalism&quot; and its immediate prohibition by the minority government motivated his entry into politics. During his studies in the United States he studied at the Andover Newton Theological School and attended the First Church in Newton, founded in 1665, both located in Newton, Massachusetts.

==ZANU==
He was one of the founders and chief architect of Zimbabwe African National Union party in August 1963 in conjunction with Herbert Chitepo, Robert Mugabe and Edgar Tekere in the Highfields House of Enos Nkala. In 1964 there was a party Congress at Gwelo, where Sithole was elected president and appointed Robert Mugabe to be his secretary general. ZANU was banned in 1964 by Ian Smith&#x27;s government. He spent 10 years in prison after being arrested on 22 June 1964 alongside Mugabe, Tekere, Nyagumbo and Takawira for his political activities. While in prison he specifically authorised Chitepo to continue the struggle from abroad as a representative of ZANU. Sithole was convicted on a charge of plotting to assassinate Ian Smith and released from prison in 1974.

On 18 March 1975 Chitepo was assassinated in Lusaka, Zambia, with a car bomb. Mugabe, in Mozambique at the time, was unanimously chosen to be the first secretary of ZANU. Later that year there was a factional split, with many Ndebele following Joshua Nkomo into the equally militant ZAPU. Sithole eventually founded the moderate ZANU-Ndonga party, which renounced violent struggle, while the Shona-dominated ZANU (now called ZANU PF) followed Mugabe with a more militant agenda.

Sithole joined Abel Muzorewa&#x27;s transitional government under the Internal Settlement on 31 July 1979. Later in September 1979 he attended the Lancaster House Agreement, chaired by Lord Carrington, which paved the way for fresh elections, but his ZANU-Ndonga Party&#x27;s supporters and their villages were targeted by Mugabe&#x27;s ZANLA troops and it failed to win any seats in the 1980 elections.

His exit from ZANU was claimed by Mugabe to have been caused by his neglecting the fighters in Zambia (where their camp was bombed resulting in many fatalities and casualties).

==Exile and return==
Declaring that his life was in danger from political enemies, Sithole went into self-imposed exile first in the United Kingdom in the early-1980s and then in Silver Spring, Maryland, United States, around 1984, returning to Zimbabwe in January 1992.

He was elected to parliament for his tribal stronghold of Chipinge in southeastern Zimbabwe in 1995, and was a candidate in the 1996 presidential election (though he withdrew shortly before the election after claiming that Mugabe&#x27;s ZANU-PF was undermining his campaign). In December 1997, a court tried and convicted him of conspiring with Chimwenje to assassinate Mugabe and the government disqualified him from attending parliament. Sithole&#x27;s small opposition group again won the Chipinge seat in the June 2000 elections.

He was granted the right to appeal, appeal was filed, but the case was never heard by the Supreme Court. He was allowed bail because of his deteriorating health. He died on 12 December 2000, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The author of three books on African politics, he is survived by his wife, Vesta, and five adult children.

His farm, &quot;Porta Farm&quot; situated from Harare on Bulawayo Road, was legally purchased in 1992 under &quot;willing buyer ‚Äì willing seller&quot; arrangements. It was later confiscated by Robert Mugabe&#x27;s ZANU-PF government, on the grounds that it harboured the &quot;undesirables&quot; of Harare. These were people who had been left homeless after being summarily evicted from shanties in Harare before the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1991. Sithole had felt compassion for them, and what he felt was the breach of their human rights; he therefore had invited some of them to stay on the farm. This incensed the government, which then carried out an eviction operation. This was co-ordinated by the Ministry of Local Government and National Housing as well as the City of Harare. Pre-dawn raids were carried out and, in the aftermath, Porta Farm was confiscated.

==Books==
Sithole was the most prolific Black author in Rhodesia. He published 12 books including &quot;The Polygamist&quot;, a novel published in 1972 by The Third Press/Joseph Okpaku Publishing Co., Inc., New York ().

<text>A Secular Humanist Declaration was an argument for and statement of support for democratic secular humanism. The document was issued in 1980 by the Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism (CODESH), now the Council for Secular Humanism (CSH). Compiled by Paul Kurtz, it is largely a restatement of the content of the American Humanist Association&#x27;s 1973 Humanist Manifesto II, of which he was co-author with Edwin H. Wilson. Both Wilson and Kurtz had served as editors of &quot;The Humanist&quot;, from which Kurtz departed in 1979 and thereafter set about establishing his own movement and his own periodical. His Secular Humanist Declaration was the starting point for these enterprises.

Before the list of signatories, the declaration has the following disclaimer: &quot;Although we who endorse this declaration may not agree with all its specific provisions, we nevertheless support its general purposes and direction and believe that it is important that they be enunciated and implemented. We call upon all men and women of good will who agree with us to join in helping to keep alive the commitment to the principles of free inquiry and the secular humanist outlook. We submit that the decline of these values could have ominous implications for the future of civilization on this planet.&quot;

<text>Histiaeus (, died 493 BC), the son of Lysagoras, was a Greek ruler of Miletus in the late 6th century¬†BC. Histiaeus was tyrant of Miletus under Darius¬†I, king of Persia, who had subjugated Miletus and the other Ionian states in Asia Minor, and who generally appointed Greeks as tyrants to rule the Greek cities of Ionia in his territory.

==Scythian campaign of Darius I (circa 513 BC)==

According to Herodotus, Histiaeus, along with the other Chiefs/Tyrants under Darius&#x27; rule, took part in the Persian expedition against the Scythians, and was put in charge of defending the bridge that Darius&#x27; troops had placed across the Danube River. The Scythians attempted to persuade Histiaeus and the others to abandon the bridge; one faction, led by Miltiades of Athens, at that time tyrant of the Chersonese, wanted to follow the Scythians&#x27; advice. However, Histiaeus argued that they should stay, as they owed their positions as tyrants to Darius and would surely be overthrown if he were killed.

Instead, according to Herodotus, Histiaeus suggested that they pretend to follow the Scythian plan. So Histiaeus was sent as an ambassador to the Scythians to tell them that the tyrants would accept the Scythian plan, while the rest of the tyrants acted as if they were demolishing the bridge. Histiaeus persuaded the Scythians to look for the Persian forces.

Herodotus writes that while the Scythians were away, the Persians returned to the Danube and Histiaeus organised the ships to successfully ferry them across the river.

During the expedition, Histiaeus&#x27; troops had started building a settlement at Myrcinus (site of the later Amphipolis) on the Strymon River. After returning with Darius to Sardis, Darius asked Histiaeus what he wanted in return for his service. Histiaeus responded that he wanted to be given control over Myrcinus, to which Darius agreed.

However, the Persian commander Megabazus suspected Histiaeus&#x27; interest in the strategically important area, which controlled key roads from Persian controlled territory into Europe, as well as known sources of silver and timber. Nevertheless, Darius considered Histiaeus to be loyal, and asked him to come back to Susa with him as a friend and advisor. Histiaeus&#x27; nephew and son-in-law Aristagoras was left in control of Miletus.

==Ionian revolt (499-494 BC)==
However, according to Herodotus, Histiaeus was unhappy having to stay in Susa, and made plans to return to his position as King of Miletus by instigating a revolt in Ionia. In 499 BC, he shaved the head of his most trusted slave, tattooed a message on his head, and then waited for his hair to grow back. The slave was then sent to Aristagoras, who was instructed to shave the slave&#x27;s head again and read the message, which told him to revolt against the Persians. Aristagoras, who was disliked by his own subjects after an expedition to Naxos ended in failure, followed Histiaeus&#x27; command, and with help from the Athenians and Eretrians, attacked and burned Sardis. When Darius learned of the revolt, he sent for Histiaeus, who pretended to have no knowledge of its origins, but asked to be sent back to Miletus to put down the revolt. Herodotus writes that Darius permitted him to leave.

On his way back, Histiaeus went to Sardis, where the satrap Artaphernes suspected Histiaeus&#x27; role in the revolt, forcing Histiaeus to flee to Chios. Histiaeus tried unsuccessfully to build a fleet while on Chios. He then returned to Miletus with the aim of becoming tyrant once more. However, the Miletians did not want a return to tyranny and exiled him to Lesbos. There, he gathered some ships and, according to Herodotus, began committing acts of piracy in the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea from a base in Byzantium.

Meanwhile, the Persians defeated the leaders of the Ionian revolt at the Battle of Lade in 494 BC. When Histiaeus learned of this he left Byzantium, and his troops attacked Chios, blockaded Thasos and then attempted to land on the mainland to attack the Persians. After joining a Greek force in battle against the Persians, he was captured by the Persian general, Harpagus in 493 BC. The satrap Artaphernes did not want to send him back to Susa, where he suspected that Darius would pardon him, so he executed him by impaling, and sent his head to Darius. According to Herodotus, Darius still did not believe Histiaeus was a traitor and gave his head an honourable burial.

<text>The Goshutes are a tribe of Western Shoshone Native Americans. There are two federally recognized Goshute tribes today:

* Confederated Tribes of the Goshute Reservation, located in Nevada and Utah
* Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians of Utah of the Skull Valley Indian Reservation, located in Utah

==Culture==
The Goshute (Gosiute) refer to themselves as the &quot;Newe&quot; [n…®w…®] or &quot;Newenee&quot; [n…®w…®n…®…®] (&#x27;Person&#x27; or &#x27;People&#x27;), though at times have used the term &quot;Kutsipiuti&quot; (&quot;Gutsipiuti&quot;) or &quot;Kuttuhsippeh&quot;, meaning &quot;People of the dry earth&quot; or &quot;People of the Desert&quot; (literally: &quot;dust, dry ashes People&quot;). Neighboring Numic-speaking peoples used variants including &quot;Kusiutta&quot; / &quot;Kusiyuttah, Kusiyuttah,&quot; &quot;Newenee&quot;, &quot;Gusiyuta&quot;, or &quot;Kusiyutah&quot; when referring to the Goshute People.

English variants included: &quot;Goshutes, Go-sha-utes, Goship-Utes, Goshoots, Gos-ta-Utes, Gishiss, Goshen Utes, Kucyut, and Gosiutsi&quot;. These names suggest a closer affinity among the Goshute and Ute Peoples than other Numic-speaking groups, such as the Shoshone and Paiute. However, &quot;Ute&quot;, &quot;Uin-tah&quot; or &quot;Utah Indian&quot; were often used as catch-all terms by Anglo-American settlers.

The Goshute occupied much of what is now the western Utah and eastern Nevada. In aboriginal times, they practiced subsistence hunting and gathering and exhibited fairly simple social structure. Organized primarily in nuclear families, the Goshutes hunted and gathered in family groups and often cooperated with other family groups that usually made up a village. Most Goshutes gathered with other families only two or three times a year, typically for pine nut harvests, communal hunts for no more than two to six weeks, and winter lodging which was for a longer period. These gatherings often lasted no more than two to six weeks, although winter gatherings were longer, with families organizing under a &quot;dagwani&quot;, or village headman.

The Goshutes hunted lizards, snakes, small fish, birds, gophers, rabbits, rats, skunks, squirrels, and, when available, pronghorn, bear, coyote, deer, elk, and bighorn sheep. Hunting of large game was usually done by men, the hunters sharing large game with other members of the village. Women and children gathered harvesting nearly 100 species of wild vegetables and seeds, the most important being the pine nut. They also gathered insects the most important being red ants, crickets and grasshoppers. However, a family was able to provide for most of its needs without assistance. Their traditional arts include beadwork and basketry.

Prior to contact with the Mormons, the Goshutes wintered in the Deep Creek Valley in dug out houses built of willow poles and earth known as wiki-ups. In the spring and summer they gathered wild onions, carrots and potatoes, and hunted small game in the mountains.

===Ethnobotany===
The Goshute use the root of &quot;Carex&quot; as medicine.

==Language==

Gosiute is one main regional dialect of Shoshoni, a Central Numic language.

==History==
The Goshute are an indigenous peoples of the Great Basin, and their traditional territory extends from the Great Salt Lake (Goshute: &quot;Tƒ≠&#x27;tsa-pa&quot; - &quot;Fish Water&quot; or &quot;Pi&#x27;a-pa&quot; - &quot;Great Water&quot;) to the Steptoe Range in Nevada, and south to Simpson Springs (Goshute term: &quot;Pi&#x27;a-pa&quot; or &quot;Toi&#x27;ba&quot;). Within this area, the Goshutes were concentrated in three areas: Deep Creek Valley near Ibapah (&quot;Ai-bim-pa / Ai&#x27;bƒ≠m-pa&quot; - &quot;White Clay Water&quot; referring to Deep Creek) on the Utah-Nevada border, Simpson&#x27;s Springs farther southeast, and the Skull (Goshute: &quot;Pa&#x27;ho-no-pi / Pa&#x27;o-no-pi&quot;) and Tooele Valleys.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Navajo and Ute slave raiders preyed upon the Goshute. Unlike their neighbors, the Goshutes only obtained horses in the late 19th century. The Goshute diet depended on the grasslands, and consisted mostly of rats, lizards, snakes, rabbits, insects, grass-seed, and roots.

The first written description of the Goshute was made in the journal of Jedediah Smith while returning from a trip to California on his way to Bear Lake (Goshute: &quot;Pa&#x27;ga-di-da-ma / Pa&#x27;ga-dƒ≠t&quot;) in 1827. For the next two decades European contact with the Goshutes remained sporadic and insignificant.

There were five divisions or subtribes: 
* Pagayuats, formerly on Otter Creek (Goshute term for otter: &quot;Pan&#x27;tsuk / Pan&#x27;tsuk&quot;)., s. w. Utah
* Pierruiats (perhaps after the Goshute term for the Deep Creek Range), living at Deep Creek, s. w. Utah, in 1873

===Conflict with Mormons ===
In 1847, pioneers with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) settled in the neighboring Salt Lake Valley, and shortly afterwards began to impinge Goshute territory. Tooele valley soon became a major grazing ground for LDS cattle owners from Salt Lake to the north and Utah Valley to the south. In 1849, the pioneers started building permanent structures in Goshute territory, beginning with a grist mill commissioned by Ezra T. Benson. Other pioneer families followed and by 1850 Tooele County was established. The Mormon encroachment severely interrupted the Goshute way of life. Mormons occupied many of the best camping sites near reliable springs, hunted in Goshute hunting grounds, and overgrazed the meadowland, leaving it unfit for sustaining the animals and plants used by the Goshutes. Pioneers believed that Utah was a promised land given to them by God, and did not recognize any Goshute claim to the land.

The Goshutes did not accept the Mormon claim of exclusive rights to natural resources. They began confiscating cattle that would trespass onto their property. At first the cattle were herded to Utah Valley, suggesting cooperation with the Timpanogos. After the Timpanogos suffered the massacres at Battle Creek and Fort Utah, many of the survivors came and combined with the Goshutes, intermarrying and assuming leadership roles. By 1851 the Goshutes had confiscated approximately $5,000 worth of cattle that had been grazing in their traditional homelands. In response, the Mormons sent an army with orders to kill the Goshute. The army ambushed a Goshute village, but the Goshute were able to defend themselves without any casualties. Later that year, a group of Goshute again confiscated cattle this time belonging to Charles White. An army of fifty Mormons attacked the Goshute camp and killed nine Goshutes. In April 1851, a group of Goshute confiscated some horses that had invaded their territory near Benson Grist Mill. General Daniel H. Wells sent a posse led by Orrin Porter Rockwell to pursue the Goshute. They lost the trail of the Goshute that had taken the horses and encountered another group of 20 or 30 people, whom they took prisoner but did not disarm. When some of the captured Goshute tried to escape, one was shot by Custer, a non-Mormon member of the posse. Custer was then shot by one of the Native Americans, who was in turn shot by another posse member. All but four or five prisoners escaped, those that didn&#x27;t escape were executed by Rockwell. The Mormons continued to push further into Goshute territory, and by 1860, there were 1008 non-Natives in the traditional Goshute homelands of Tooele, Rush, and Skull Valleys. With the settlement of Ibapah, the Mormons had completely pushed the Goshutes out of any favored land.

===Goshute War===

Soon 49ers and later wagon trains of emigrant groups continually passed through their territory on the way west to California. Contact increased when the military established Camp Floyd at Fairfield, later the Pony Express and Butterfield Overland Mail set up stations along the Central Overland Route between Fairfield, Simpson Springs, Fish Springs, and Deep Creek. Soon after telegraph lines were strung along that route. Ranchers and farmers moved into the region, like the stations, taking the best lands available with water and forage, significant water and resource sites for the Goshutes in the otherwise barren land.

Finally after attacks on the Central Overland stage stations and coaches in the early 1860s, California Volunteers of the Union Army, under Brigadier-General Patrick E. Connor, attacked the Goshutes, killing many and forcing the survivors to sign a treaty. The treaty did not give up land or sovereignty but did agree to end all hostile actions against the whites and to allow several routes of travel to pass through their country. They also agreed to the construction of military posts and station houses wherever necessary. Stage lines, telegraph lines, and railways would be permitted to be built through their domain; mines, mills, and ranches would be permitted and timber could be cut. The federal government agreed to pay the Goshutes $1,000.00 a year for twenty years as compensation for the destruction of their game. The treaty was signed on October 12, 1863, ratified in 1864 and announced by President Lincoln on January 17, 1865.

The tribe ratified their constitution in 1940. In 1993, they had 413 enrolled members.

==Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians of Utah==
The Skull Valley Indian Reservation is located in Tooele County, Utah, about halfway between the Goshute Reservation and Salt Lake City, Utah. The tribe consists of about 130 people, of whom 31 live on an reservation located at in Tooele County. The Dugway Proving Grounds lies just south of Skull Valley. To the east is a nerve gas storage facility and to the north is the Magnesium Corporation plant which has had severe environmental problems. The reservation was a proposed location for an dry cask storage facility for the storage of 40,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel. Only are for the actual facility, and the rest of the land is a buffer area. 8¬Ω years after application, this facility was licensed by the NRC.

The office of the Skull Valley Band of Goshute is located at 407 Skull Valley Road, Skull Valley, Utah. Tribal membership at the end of 2020 is 148.

<text>George Procter Hawtrey (1847‚Äì17 August 1910) was a British actor, playwright and pageantmaster, and former schoolmaster.

==Early life and education==
Hawtrey was son of Reverend John William Hawtrey, headmaster of the Alden House School at Slough. Hawtrey&#x27;s two brothers, William and Charles, were also actors. He was educated at Eton College and Pembroke College, Oxford. A cousin was the economist Alfred Marshall.

==Academia==
Having been assistant master at the school founded by his father, Hawtrey decided to leave teaching and follow his brother, Charles, onto the stage.

==Stage career==
Hawtrey did not make a notable success as an actor, raising his family in &quot;straitened circumstances&quot; which inspired his son, Ralph, to follow the more remunerative path of the civil service. Hawtrey&#x27;s most notable achievement in connection with the stage was his adaptation of Baron von Moser&#x27;s farce &quot;Mit Vergn√ºgen&quot; (The Pickpocket), in which his brother Charles acted. He also assisted in preparing &quot;A Message From Mars&quot; for the stage. In 1908, Hawtrey became master of the Gloucestershire Historical Pageant at Cheltenham, followed by the National Pageant of Wales at Cardiff in October 1909 and the Chester Pageant in July 1910.

==Personal life==
Hawtrey married firstly, in 1873, Eda (died 1892), daughter of William Strahan; he married secondly, Gertrude Jessie Rolls, daughter of Captain John Simon Chandos Harcourt, of Ankerwycke, Buckinghamshire. He fathered one son- the economist Ralph George Hawtrey- and two daughters. According to an obituary published in &quot;The Times&quot;, Hawtrey died of heart failure on 17 August 1910 at his London residence, Clarence Gate Mansions, at Marylebone (today Clarence Gate Gardens) following a severe bout with asthma while putting on the Chester Pageant in July of that year. He was 63 years old.

<text>Martin William Liquori (born September 11, 1949) is a retired American middle distance athlete.

Liquori rose to fame when he became the third American high schooler to break the four-minute mile by running a 3:59.8 in 1967, three years after Jim Ryun first did it.

He grew up in Cedar Grove, New Jersey and attended Essex Catholic High School. After high school, Liquori enrolled at Villanova University. There he was coached by Jumbo Elliott.

Liquori made the U.S. Olympic team in 1968 as a nineteen-year-old freshman. He reached the finals of the 1,500 meter run but suffered a stress fracture and finished 12th. He was the youngest person ever to compete in the final.

In 1969, he finished second to Ryun in the NCAA indoor mile, then won the NCAA and AAU outdoor mile championships by turning the tables on Ryun and beating him. He repeated the AAU outdoor in 1970 and had his best year in 1971, winning the NCAA and AAU outdoor titles, and a gold medal in the 1,500 m at the Pan-American Games. Also in 1969 and 1971, he was ranked number 1 in the world for 1500 meters/mile. In 1977 he was ranked number 1 in 5000 meters and set a U.S. record of 13:15.1 while finishing second to Miruts Yifter in the inaugural World Cup.

On May 16, 1971, Liquori lowered his personal best to 3:54.6 in the Dream Mile in Philadelphia and beat Ryun by a few steps.

But Liquori was injured later that year. He didn&#x27;t return to competition until 1973. In 1975, he ran a personal best 3:52.2 in the mile, finishing second to Filbert Bayi (who broke Ryun&#x27;s world record in that race by 0.1 second with a 3:51.0), and set a United States record of 8:17.12 in the 2 mile. Liquori retired from competitive distance running in 1980.

He has written an autobiography, &quot;On The Run&quot;, and he also wrote &quot;Guide to the Elite Runner&quot; and &quot;Home Gym Workout&quot;. He was a founder of The Athletic Attic Footwear chain in 1972.
Liquori lives in Gainesville, Florida. Liquori did commentary at the Munich, Montreal, Sidney, Barcelona, Seoul and Athens Olympic Games and the New York and Boston Marathons. Liquori produced and hosted ‚ÄúRunning and Racing‚Äù on ESPN for 14 years and Fitness Adventures on the Outdoor Life Network. Liquori was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is now in remission.
Liquori has been inducted into the New Jersey Sports Hall of Fame, National Track and Field Hall of Fame, Italian American Hall of Fame, National High School Hall of Game, National Distance Running Hall of Fame, USTFCCCA Collegiate Athlete Hall of Fame, and the Cosida Academic All American Hall of Fame.

<text>David Edgar Herold (June 16, 1842 ‚Äì July 7, 1865) was an American pharmacist&#x27;s assistant and accomplice of John Wilkes Booth in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865. After the shooting, Herold accompanied Booth to the home of Samuel Mudd, who set Booth&#x27;s injured leg. The two men then continued their escape through Maryland and into Virginia, and Herold remained with Booth until the authorities cornered them in a barn. Herold surrendered, but Booth was shot to death by Sergeant Boston Corbett. Herold was tried by a military tribunal, sentenced to death for conspiracy, and hanged with three other conspirators at the Washington Arsenal, now known as Fort Lesley J. McNair.

==Biography==

===Early life===
David E. Herold was born in Maryland, the sixth of eleven children of Adam George Herold (1803‚Äì1864) and Mary Ann Porter (1810‚Äì1883). Adam and Mary were married on November 9, 1828, in Washington, D.C. David was their only son to survive to adulthood. His father Adam was the Chief Clerk of the Naval Storehouse at the Washington Navy Yard for over 20 years. Herold&#x27;s family was well-off financially and lived in a large brick house at 636 Eighth Street SE in Washington, D.C., near the Washington Navy Yard. David attended Gonzaga College High School, Georgetown College, Charlotte Hall Military Academy (at Charlotte Hall, St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland), and the Rittenhouse Academy. In 1860 Herold received a certificate in pharmacy from Georgetown College. He then worked as a pharmacist&#x27;s assistant and as a clerk for a doctor and was an avid hunter. He became acquainted with John Surratt while attending Charlotte Hall Military Academy classes in the late 1850s. A few years later, in December 1864, Surratt introduced him to John Wilkes Booth.

===Assassination plot===
Herold and a group of co-conspirators had originally plotted to kidnap Lincoln, but later decided to kill him, Vice President Andrew Johnson, and Secretary of State William H. Seward in a bid to help the Confederacy&#x27;s cause.
On the night of April 14, 1865, Herold guided Lewis Powell to Seward&#x27;s house. Inside, Powell attempted to kill Seward, severely wounding him and other members of his household. The ensuing commotion frightened Herold and he rode off, leaving Powell to fend for himself. Another conspirator, George Atzerodt, was supposed to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson, but he got drunk at a bar instead.

Booth shot Lincoln at Ford&#x27;s Theater. When he jumped onto the stage after shooting Lincoln in the back of the head, he may have broken his fibula. He fled on horseback across the bridge into Maryland, where he met Herold. They headed to Surrattsville, Maryland (now Clinton), where they picked up weapons that Mary Surratt had left earlier for them at her tavern. Booth and Herold went to the home of Samuel Mudd, who set Booth&#x27;s leg. Mudd let Booth and Herold rest at his home for a few hours. The pair then headed to the house of Samuel Cox, a Confederate sympathizer. He refused to let the two into his house, and insisted that they stay in a thicket behind the house. He brought food, whiskey, and newspapers to Booth and Herold, which is how Booth realized that he wasn&#x27;t seen as the hero (like Marcus Junius Brutus) that he longed to be. After a close encounter with the Union, Herold slaughtered the horses that he and Booth rode, worrying they would give the two away. Cox later gave Booth a skiff to cross the Potomac River. Due to the thick fog, instead of landing in Virginia as planned, Herold and Booth landed in Maryland. They next threatened a farmer and forced him and his family to sleep outside while the assassin and his cohort slept in the bedrooms. They left in the morning and went to a farm owned by Richard Henry Garrett. Unaware of what they had done, Garrett let them stay on his property. After Booth got drunk, Garrett made the two sleep in the tobacco barn. Soon, they woke to the sounds of horses.

Herold and Booth were trapped by Union soldiers on April 26. Herold surrendered, but Booth refused to lay down his arms and was shot by Boston Corbett through a crack in the barn wall. He died a few hours later.

==Trial and execution==
Herold was tried before a military tribunal. As he had already admitted his involvement in the assassination conspiracy, the only defense his lawyer Frederick Stone could offer was that Herold was feeble-minded and under undue influence from Booth. His defense being unsuccessful, Herold was convicted and sentenced to death. He was hanged in Washington, D.C., on July 7, 1865. The fall from the gallows did not break his neck; he struggled for nearly five minutes, slowly strangling to death.

On February 15, 1869, Herold&#x27;s mother and five of his sisters interred his remains in Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., in an unmarked grave, next to the grave of his father Adam. The gravestone memorializing David in Congressional Cemetery was placed there in July 1917, at the time of the burial of his sister.

==Cultural references==
Gore Vidal&#x27;s fictionalized account of Lincoln&#x27;s presidency, &quot;Lincoln&quot;, includes a heavy focus on David Herold. In the Afterword, when Vidal explains the extent to which his novel is true to fact, he writes, &quot;As David&#x27;s life is largely unknown until Booth&#x27;s conspiracy, I have invented a low-life for him.&quot;

In the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Assassins&quot;, David Herold appears in the song &quot;The Ballad of Booth&quot;, in which Booth forces Herold at gunpoint to write why Booth killed Lincoln. However, when soldiers surround the barn where they are hiding, Herold runs.

David Herold is played by Troy Acree in Season 4, Episode 2 of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; which dramatizes the conspiracy theory that Booth escaped capture and died in 1903.

In the 2024 series Manhunt, Herold is played by Will Harrison.

<doc id="620780" wikidata="Q946591" url="?curid=620780" title="Jim Matheson">
<text>James David Matheson (born March 21, 1960) is an American politician who served as a United States Representative from Utah from 2001 to 2015. He represented Utah&#x27;s 2nd district from 2001 to 2013 and its from 2013 to 2015 as a member of the Democratic Party. While in office, he was Utah&#x27;s only congressional Democrat, and his district was one of the most Republican-leaning districts to be represented by a Democrat.

On December 17, 2013, Matheson announced he would not seek reelection in the 2014 elections. There was speculation that Matheson, a moderate Democrat, might run in 2016 for Governor of Utah or for the Utah U.S. Senate seat coming open then, but this did not happen. In 2015, he joined the law firm of Squire Patton Boggs as a lobbyist. On June 13, 2016, he was named the CEO of National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, a trade organization for rural electric cooperatives, and on July 19, 2016, he succeeded fellow former Representative Jo Ann Emerson as CEO.

==Early life, education and career==

Matheson was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and obtained an A.B. from Harvard College and his M.B.A. from the UCLA Anderson School of Management. His father, Scott M. Matheson, served as governor of Utah from 1977 to 1985, his mother, Norma Matheson, served as First Lady of Utah and a prominent figure in the state Democratic Party, and his brother, Scott Matheson, Jr., was the 2004 Democratic nominee for Governor. Matheson is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Prior to entering politics, Matheson worked in the energy field, working for several different companies and studying environmental policy. He later started his own energy consulting firm.

His wife, Amy, is a pediatrician and they have two sons, William and Harris.

He joined a group that was in favor of increased compensation for people who were affected by the radiation from Cold War atomic testing. The radioactive fallout from nuclear tests caused the cancer that killed Matheson&#x27;s father.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Matheson was co-chairman of the Blue Dog Coalition, a conservative group of 25 Democrats in the House. He was also a member of the New Democrat Coalition. During his congressional tenure, he was the only Democrat in Utah&#x27;s Congressional Delegation.

During his time in Congress, Matheson was relatively conservative by national party standards. In the &quot;National Journal&quot; ratings in 2010, Matheson was more conservative than 51% of his colleagues, but more liberal than 49%, making him one of the most conservative Democrats, yet a centrist overall. On November 3, Matheson voted against requiring public disclosure of bonuses and golden parachute arrangements (agreements between a company and an employee specifying that the employee will receive significant benefits if they are terminated). This was a bill that the Democrats heavily supported and the Republicans opposed; only five other Democrats voted against the bill.

=== Foreign policy and terrorism ===
In March 2007, Matheson was one of 14 Democrats who voted against a bill that would require President George W. Bush to bring combat troops home from Iraq by September 1, 2008. Matheson regularly voted in favor of the wars in the Middle East, having voted for the 2003 Iraq invasion and opposing the bill to remove troops from Libya in 2011 and Pakistan in 2010. He did, however, vote in favor of requiring a time-table for withdrawal from Afghanistan, after opposing the bill in two previous votes.

In 2011, Matheson voted to extend expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act and voted in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2012.

=== Abortion ===
Matheson leans anti-abortion but supports expanding federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. He was rated 55% from National Right to Life Committee indicating a mixed record on abortion and 30% from NARAL indicating an anti-abortion voting record. However, Matheson&#x27;s NARAL Pro-Choice America rating dropped to 0% in 2010, while he garnered a 50% rating from the National Right to Life Committee.

=== Debt and economy ===
Matheson voted against raising the federal debt limit, as well as against both Republican and Democratic budgets that did not reduce the deficit. Matheson, a former energy industry businessman, voted against authorizing the construction of new oil refineries.

Matheson was a strong supporter of Wall Street regulation, voting in favor of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the strongest set of Wall Street reforms since the 1930s. In a comment on this legislation, Matheson stated, &quot;Nearly two years ago the subprime mortgage meltdown triggered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. We&#x27;ve been living under the same set of rules that were in place before the financial crisis sparked the job-killing recession. Now, that is about to change.&quot;

In July 2011, Matheson was one of five Democrats to vote for the Cut, Cap and Balance Act.

In January 2013, Matheson was one of sixteen Democrats that voted against the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was the last minute solution to the U.S. fiscal cliff. Matheson released a statement saying that &quot;to address the fiscal cliff, legislation must include a strong framework for real deficit reduction. Sadly, this bill falls short.&quot;

=== Education ===
Matheson is also opposed to the No Child Left Behind Act, believing that education is a local issue and federal funds should come with minimal strings attached. Matheson also believes that the &quot;Highly Qualified Teacher&quot; requirements should be more flexible, and that states should have alternative options to the single standardized test used in No Child Left Behind.

=== Healthcare ===
In November 2009, during intense debates over American health care reform, Matheson voted against the Affordable Health Care for America Act. When President Obama named Matheson&#x27;s brother Scott M. Matheson to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit at a time where he needed Matheson&#x27;s vote for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; posted an article that said &quot;Barack Obama will host ten House Democrats who voted against the health care bill in November at the White House; he&#x27;s obviously trying to persuade them to switch their vote to yes. One of the ten is Jim Matheson of Utah.&quot; They suggested that the White House was using this timely nomination to influence Matheson&#x27;s vote. Matheson responded by saying that he is very happy for his brother and that &quot;the federal 10th Circuit Court will gain a judge devoted to judicial integrity, fairness and knowledge of the law.&quot; In March 2010, he was one of 34 Democrats to vote against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which passed the House 219‚Äì212. However, when the 112th Congress reconsidered the legislation in January 2011, Matheson voted against repealing the healthcare overhaul.

===Committee assignments===
Congressman Matheson sat on these committees and subcommittees in the 111th Congress:
* Committee on Energy and Commerce
** Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade
** Subcommittee on Health

===Caucus memberships===
* Congressional Arts Caucus
* Congressional Cement Caucus, Co-chair

==Political campaigns==

===2000===
In 2000, Matheson was tapped to run for the 2nd district seat. The Democrats were optimistic in part because the 2nd district has historically been friendlier to Democrats than the rest of Utah and in part because two-term incumbent Merrill Cook had a reputation for erratic behavior. The prospect of losing the seat frightened district Republicans enough that Cook was unseated in the primary by computer executive Derek Smith. However, Matheson defeated Smith comfortably, taking 56% of the vote even as George W. Bush won the district with 57% of the vote.

===2002===
During the 2000s round of redistricting, the Republican-controlled state legislature made the 2nd significantly more Republican than its predecessor. The old 2nd had been located entirely in Salt Lake County since the 1980s round of redistricting; Salt Lake County has historically been friendlier to Democrats (at least at the state and local level) than the rest of Utah. The legislature drew all or part of 14 mostly rural counties in eastern and southern Utah into the 2nd. They were only connected to Salt Lake City by a narrow band of territory in heavily Republican Utah County. In addition, the legislature shifted most of western Salt Lake City to the 1st, leaving the more conservative eastern part of the city in the 2nd. The new district was approximately six points more Republican than its predecessor.

Ultimately, Matheson defeated State Representative John Swallow by only 1,600 votes, largely due to a 25,800-vote margin over Swallow in Salt Lake County. According to at least one study, some extra financial help from the Republican Party might have helped Swallow defeat Matheson. However, national Republicans stayed out of the race after state legislators claimed they had drawn a district that no Democrat could possibly win.

===2004===
Matheson defeated Swallow again‚Äîthis time by a 12-point margin even as Bush won the state by a large margin (and carried the district with 67 percent of the vote).

===2006===

Matheson defeated State Representative LaVar Christensen by 22 points.

===2008===

Matheson defeated Republican challenger Bill Dew in the 2008 general election by 28 percent.

===2010===

Matheson defeated Republican nominee Morgan Philpot. In May, Matheson faced his first challenge from within his party. Claudia Wright claimed that Jim Matheson was not liberal enough and obtained 45% of the vote at the Democratic State Convention, forcing a primary for the Democratic nomination. After weeks of campaigning Matheson secured the Democratic nomination, by obtaining 67.5% of the vote.

===2012===
Matheson had said he was considering a run for statewide office in 2012, particularly if his seat was substantially changed in redistricting. Polling conducted in July 2011 showed Matheson leading incumbent Republican Senator Orrin Hatch in a possible 2012 Senate race.

On December 15, 2011, Matheson announced that he would run for the newly created seat in the 4th congressional district, meaning there would be an open-seat race for the 2nd district. The 2nd district race was not expected to be competitive for Democrats. In a three-way race between Matheson, Mia Love (Republican) and Jim Vein (Libertarian), Matheson beat Love by 768 votes. In the race, Vein garnered 6,439 votes.

==Electoral history==
&quot;Note: Totals may not equal 100.0 percent due to rounding.&quot;

*Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 2000, Steven Alberts Voris received 597 votes. In 2004, Personal Choice Party candidate Ronald R. Amos received 1,210 votes. In 2006, Libertarian Party candidate Austin Sherwood Lett received 1,620 votes.

<doc id="620782" wikidata="Q166928" url="?curid=620782" title="Chris Cannon">
<text>Christopher Black Cannon (October 20, 1950 ‚Äì May 8, 2024) was an American politician who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives, for the Republican Party, representing the third district of Utah from 1997 to 2009.

== Personal life ==

Cannon was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and attended Brigham Young University (BYU) as well as J. Reuben Clark Law School of BYU. From 1980 until 1996 he was a lawyer, business owner, and venture capitalist, from which he became a millionaire. His other jobs included time as an associate solicitor for the United States Department of the Interior from 1984 to 1986, and time as Utah Republican Party finance chairman from 1992 until 1994. On June 24, 2008, he was defeated in the 2008 Republican Party third district primary by Jason Chaffetz, former chief of staff to then-Utah Governor Jon Huntsman Jr.

Chris Cannon was a member of the Cannon family of Utah. His brother, Joe Cannon is the former GOP State Party Chairman, and was appointed Editor in Chief of the &quot;Deseret Morning News&quot; in November 2006. He was the third member of his family to serve in the House, but the first &quot;voting&quot; member. His great-grandfather, George Q. Cannon, was a nonvoting member of the House from 1873 to 1881, while Utah was still a territory, whose son Frank Cannon was the state&#x27;s first senator, as well as a non voting delegate.

Cannon and his wife, Claudia, had eight children; their daughter, Rachel, died from cancer in 2005.

Cannon died in Provo on May 8, 2024, at the age of 73.

== Congressional career ==

In 1996, Cannon was the Republican candidate in Utah&#x27;s 3rd District against Democratic incumbent Bill Orton, who had managed to hold the seat for three terms (all by fairly large margins) despite its heavy Republican tilt. This time, however, the district&#x27;s partisan lean proved too much for Orton to overcome, and Cannon defeated him by four points. He never faced another general election contest nearly that close, and was reelected five times.

Cannon first entered the national spotlight in 1999, when as a member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, he was one of 13 House managers who prosecuted the case against President Bill Clinton in the impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate.

Cannon was named Chairman of the Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee at the beginning of the 108th Congress in January 2003, and served as its ranking Republican from 2007 to 2009. He also served on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property.

Cannon was also a member of the House Government Reform Committee. He served on the Subcommittees on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources as well as Regulatory Affairs. Cannon was also a member of the House Resources Committee, serving on the Energy and Mineral Resources and Forests and Forest Health Subcommittees.

In 2000, Cannon co-founded the Congressional Caucus to Fight and Control Methamphetamine, which has nearly 130 members from both major political parties in 2008.

In January 2001, Cannon hired David Safavian as his chief of staff. Safavian left on May 16, 2002, to take a position at the General Services Administration. Safavian was arrested in September 2005 in connection with the Jack Abramoff corruption case, and was convicted in June 2006 on four felony counts.

In January 2003, Cannon was elected chairman of the influential Western Caucus, an organization of over 50 Congressmen working on resource management issues.

He was a cosponsor of HR 2043, legislation that would provide voting representation for the District of Columbia. The bill also gives another congressional seat to Utah.

== Campaigns and challengers ==
Cannon was one of the most conservative members of the House. He had a lifetime rating of 96 from the American Conservative Union. This is not surprising, as he represented one of the most Republican districts in the nation. President George W. Bush received 77% of the vote in the district in 2004, his second highest percentage for a congressional district not located in Texas. However, during his last three reelection bids, he faced primary challengers running well to his right.

=== 2004 ===
In 2004, Cannon defeated Republican challenger Matt Throckmorton in the primary, getting 58.4% of the vote, in a race in which the major issue dividing the candidates was immigration policy. He then beat Democratic opponent Beau Babka 63%‚Äì33% in the November race. Cannon spent more than $600,000 to defeat Throckmorton and Babka. Throckmorton raised $84,000; Babka spent $35,000. The spending imbalance was offset to some extent by immigration reform groups that attacked Cannon through billboards, ads, and websites, though these did not support his Democratic opponent.

=== 2006 ===

====Primary====
Cannon faced opposition in the primaries from a fellow Republican for the first five times he ran (and won), but his opposition in 2006 seemed potentially stronger. In October 2005, millionaire real estate developer John D. Jacob announced that he would run against Cannon in 2006. In May 2006, at the state GOP convention, Jacob surprised Cannon by winning 52 percent of the delegate ballots to Cannon&#x27;s 48 percent‚Äîa shocking result for a five-term incumbent. Had Jacob won 60 percent of the delegate ballots, he would have won the nomination outright and ended Cannon&#x27;s congressional run. Team America PAC, a PAC dedicated to strict immigration enforcement, spent $50,000 on a radio advertising campaign attacking Cannon for his views on immigration (&quot;A vote for John Jacob is a vote for cleaning up the immigration mess Chris Cannon helped make&quot;).

The Republican primary was held on June 27, 2006. Polls predicted a close race. However, Cannon received 32,306 votes (55.8%) and Jacob received 25,589 votes (44.2%).

====General election====
Cannon faced Democrat Christian Burridge, a consumer rights attorney and also a graduate of Brigham Young University&#x27;s Law School, in November, as well as Jim Noorlander (Constitution Party) and Phil Hallman (Libertarian party). In the general election, Cannon received 92,621 votes (58%), Burridge 51,396 (32%), Noorlander 14,116 (9%) and Hallman 1,998 votes (1%). Cannon&#x27;s 58 percent was somewhat closer than expected, given the heavy Republican tilt of his district.

=== 2008 ===
In 2008, Cannon faced two primary opponents‚ÄîJason Chaffetz, a businessman and chief of staff to Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr. and David O. Leavitt, brother of former governor Mike Leavitt. On the first ballot at the state convention, Chaffetz received 59.01% of the delegate vote to Cannon&#x27;s 40.9%. Chaffetz fell a few hundred votes short of clinching the nomination outright. Leavitt was eliminated, and immediately endorsed Cannon. Young Leavitt supporters then walked into the convention hall with newly toted signs in support of Cannon, which &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; termed &quot;likely a violation of the convention rules.&quot; The rule supposedly referred to is &quot;Physical Arrangements ‚Äì 3(d)&quot; which states &quot;No signs may be placed in or around the staging area of the arena or in the convention hall between bleachers in the main Assembly Hall, except as approved by the State Party,&quot; which prohibits the placement of signs in the convention hall, but not the carrying nor holding of signs. The supporters were asked to leave the hall by the state vice chairman and exited when called upon to do so.

In the June 24 runoff primary, Chaffetz beat Cannon by nearly 9,000 votes, 60%‚Äì40%, ending Cannon&#x27;s congressional career. Immigration policy was again a significant issue. Cannon refused to meet with Chaffetz after the election to discuss the Transition.

==Controversies==

===Premium Beef of Nebraska===

Cannon&#x27;s financial disclosure statements showed that he gave a loan of between $50,000 and $100,000 to Gary Ruse, an executive and later president of First National Bank of Nebraska, in September 1996. The following year, the bank made a loan of $250,000 to the Premium Beef of Nebraska company, a kosher beef packing plant in which Cannon was a major investor. Ruse said in an interview he played no part in getting Cannon the loan. It was a decision, he said, that was made by the bank&#x27;s board of directors; he had recused himself.

The Premium Beef plant operated for a little more than a year before closing its doors, after the rabbi who oversaw the preparation of the meat died. Cannon&#x27;s chief of staff, Joe Hunter, said that the assets of the business were liquidated and Cannon repaid the loan to the Nebraska bank in 2001. The plant was sold to a Hasidic Jewish sect that took several years but finally reopened it in 2005. Ruse, who left the bank, was hired as manager for the reopened plant.

Cannon&#x27;s personal loan to Ruse remains outstanding. Cannon spokesman Charles Isom said that Ruse made a payment on the loan in late 1996 and then payments on the interest in 2000 and 2001. According to Cannon&#x27;s financial disclosure forms, Cannon collected between $200 and $1,000 in interest on Ruse&#x27;s loan in 2000 and 2001. He did not collect interest in 2002 or 2003 and had not otherwise received interest payments.

Cannon&#x27;s office stressed that the congressman made repeated efforts to collect the loan. Cannon&#x27;s most recent financial disclosure forms show the amount outstanding is still over $50,000.

===Lobbying by brother Joe Cannon===
Chris Cannon&#x27;s brother, Joseph Cannon, was chairman of the Utah Republican Party, a former business partner of his brother, and led a team of 10 lobbyists at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, a law and lobbying firm. From late 2006 to 2010, he served as editor of Utah&#x27;s second-largest daily newspaper, &quot;Deseret Morning News&quot; (now &quot;Deseret News&quot;).

Cannon acknowledged helping his brother&#x27;s clients, pointing out that he had been active on the issue in the past before being approached by his brother. &quot;If my wife decided to lobby, then we would probably say, &#x27;No talking to my office.&#x27; I just don&#x27;t see my brother in the same category,&quot; Cannon said.

Cannon had a financial interest in his brother&#x27;s success: The lobbyist owed him more than $250,000, according to the lawmaker&#x27;s financial disclosure reports. The debt stems from Joseph Cannon&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign for the U. S. Senate in 1992. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonpartisan advocacy organization, named Chris Cannon a &quot;member to watch&quot; on its list of &quot;most corrupt&quot; members of Congress for his dealings with his brother.

===Obama autobiography===

Cannon offered Hertford College, Oxford philosopher Peter Millican $10,000 to prove that then-presidential candidate Barack Obama&#x27;s memoir &quot;Dreams from My Father&quot; was ghostwritten by Bill Ayers by using computer analysis to compare that work to Ayers&#x27; &quot;Fugitive Days&quot;. During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, conservatives attempted to link Obama to Ayers, a former radical leader of the Weather Underground. Regarding the claim that Ayers authored Obama&#x27;s book, Millican concluded &quot;I feel totally confident that it is false&quot;.

==Electoral history==
*Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 1992, Nels J&#x27;Anthony received 384 votes. In 1996, John Phillip Langford received 270 votes. In 1998, write-ins received 20 votes. In 2000, Natural Law candidate Randall Tolpinrud received 852 votes. In 2002, John William Maurin received 1 vote. In 2004, Curtis Darrell James received 2,390 votes.

<doc id="620785" wikidata="Q1264941" url="?curid=620785" title="Council of Laodicea">
<text>The Council of Laodicea was a regional Christian synod of approximately thirty clerics from Asia Minor which assembled about 363‚Äì364 in Laodicea, Phrygia Pacatiana.

==Historical context==
The council took place soon after the conclusion of the war between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire, waged by Emperor Julian. Julian, the last Constantinian emperor, attempted a revival of paganism. After his death in battle on 26 June 363, officers of the army elected the Christian Jovian as his successor. Jovian, in a precarious position, far from supplies, ended the war with Persia unfavorably for Rome. He was soon succeeded by Valentinian I, who named his brother Valens as Emperor of the East.

==Major concerns==
The major concerns of the council involved regulating the conduct of church members. The council expressed its decrees in the form of written rules or canons. Among the sixty canons decreed, several aimed at:

* Maintaining order among bishops, clerics and laypeople (canons 3‚Äì5, 11‚Äì13, 21‚Äì27, 40‚Äì44, 56‚Äì57)
* Enforcing modest behavior of clerics and laypeople (4, 27, 30, 36, 53‚Äì55)
* Regulating approach to heretics (canons 6‚Äì10, 31‚Äì34, 37), Jews (canons 16, 37‚Äì38) and pagans (canon 39)
* Outlawing the keeping of the Sabbath (Saturday), and encouraging rest on Sunday (canon 29)
* Outlining liturgical practices (canons 14‚Äì20, 21‚Äì23, 25, 28, 58‚Äì59)
* Restrictions during lent (canons 45, 49‚Äì52)
* Admission and instruction of catechumens and s (canons 45‚Äì48)
* Specifying a biblical canon (canons 59‚Äì60)

==Biblical canon==
The 59th canon forbade the readings in churches of uncanonical books. The 60th canon listed canonical books, with the New Testament containing 26 books, omitting the Book of Revelation, and the Old Testament including 22 books from the Tanakh and some deuterocanonical books as the Book of Baruch, and the Epistle of Jeremiah. 

The authenticity of the 60th canon is doubtful, as it is missing from various Greek manuscripts and may have been added later to specify the extent of the preceding 59th canon. The Latin version of the canons of Laodicea consistently omit the canon list. Around 350, Cyril of Jerusalem produced a list of biblical books matching that from the Council of Laodicea.

==Astrology==
The council marks the first occasion in Christianity of the explicit condemnation of astrology, a matter on which theologians and legislators had not yet reached consensus.

<text>William Joseph Devane (born September 5, 1939) is an American actor. He is known for his role as Greg Sumner on the primetime soap opera &quot;Knots Landing&quot; (1983‚Äì1993) and as James Heller on the Fox serial dramas &quot;24&quot; (2001‚Äì2010) and &quot;24: Live Another Day&quot; (2014).

==Early life==
Devane was born on September 5, 1939, in Albany, New York, the son of Joseph Devane, who had been Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s chauffeur when he was governor of New York. His father was of Irish descent and his mother Kate had Dutch and German ancestry. Devane graduated from Philip Schuyler High School in Albany, and then the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City in 1962.

==Career==
Devane began his acting career with the New York Shakespeare Festival, where he performed in fifteen plays.

In 1966, Devane portrayed Robert F. Kennedy in the off-Broadway spoof &quot;MacBird&quot;. He gained acclaim for his role as President John F. Kennedy in a television docudrama about the Cuban Missile Crisis, &quot;The Missiles of October&quot; (1974) and again when he played blacklisted radio personality John Henry Faulk in the Emmy Award-winning TV movie &quot;Fear on Trial&quot; (1975). Devane starred as Master Sgt. Milt Warden in the miniseries remake of &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1979); he later reprised that role in a weekly series that was canceled after one season. Devane is widely known for his ten years as the ambitious and hardnosed politician-turned-corporate titan Greg Sumner on &quot;Knots Landing&quot;.

In 1971, he starred off-Broadway as Randle McMurphy in the first stage revival of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; alongside Danny DeVito as Martini, who would go on to reprise the role in the acclaimed film of the same name alongside Jack Nicholson.

In 1994, Devane appeared as Al Capone in &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; in an episode entitled &quot;That Old Gang of Mine&quot;. He had a recurring role on the CBS show &quot;Early Edition&quot; (1996‚Äì2000) as the lead character&#x27;s father. Devane appeared in the films &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; (1971); &quot;Lady Liberty&quot; (1971); &quot;Family Plot&quot; (1976), directed by Alfred Hitchcock; &quot;Marathon Man&quot; (1976); &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; (1977); &quot;Yanks&quot; (1979); &quot;Testament&quot; (1983) with Jane Alexander; &quot;Timestalkers&quot; (1987) with Lauren Hutton and Klaus Kinski; &quot;Forgotten Sins&quot; (1996) with John Shea; &quot;Exception to the Rule&quot; (1997); &quot;Payback&quot; (1999); &quot;Hollow Man&quot; (2000) and &quot;Space Cowboys&quot; (2000).

Devane has played members of the Presidential Cabinet on two evening dramas. In 2004, on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, he guest-starred as the secretary of state and potential vice presidential nominee. Devane appeared in several scenes with Martin Sheen; they also appeared together as President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert, respectively, 30 years earlier in &quot;The Missiles of October&quot; (1974). In 2005, he joined the cast of &quot;24&quot; as Secretary of Defense James Heller for seasons four through six.

===Later career===
In 2004, Devane appeared in three episodes of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; as President Henry Hayes and appears in the direct-to-DVD movie &quot;&quot;. He also co-starred in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Crumbs&quot; and as Brian&#x27;s real-estate broker father in &quot;What About Brian&quot; (2006‚Äì07). In 2008, he appeared in Russ Emanuel&#x27;s &quot;Chasing the Green&quot; alongside Jeremy London, Ryan Hurst, and Robert Picardo. He also appears as police officer turned psychologist Dr. Dix in the Jesse Stone mystery movies with Tom Selleck. In 2010, he appeared in the &quot;NCIS&quot; episode &quot;Worst Nightmare&quot; as a grandfather who is not what he appears to be, and is actually a former U.S. deep-cover special-operations agent, of a child kidnapped from Marine Corps Base Quantico. Also in 2010, Devane guest starred as retired Detective Peters along with Carl Weathers in episode 6 of season 5 of &quot;Psych&quot;, &quot;Viagra Falls&quot;

In 2012, Devane began a recurring role as Grandpa Edward Grayson on the ABC primetime soap opera &quot;Revenge&quot;. Devane also played the President of the United States in the Christopher Nolan film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;. Devane reprised his role as James Heller, now President, in the limited-run series &quot;24: Live Another Day&quot;, which premiered in May 2014.

Devane had a cameo role as Williams, as part of NASA, in the 2014 film &quot;Interstellar&quot; and a year later, was also part of the regular cast of the sitcom &quot;The Grinder&quot;. In 2022, he appeared in a four-episode guest arc on the Amazon Prime Video detective series &quot;&quot;.

<text>The Wanamaker Mile is a prestigious indoor mile race for elite middle distance runners held annually at the Millrose Games in New York City. Alongside Oslo&#x27;s Dream Mile and Eugene&#x27;s Bowerman Mile, the Wanamaker Mile is among the world&#x27;s premier mile races. It is the signature and concluding event of the Millrose Games, and is named in honor of department store owner Rodman Wanamaker.

The race is a tradition for Irish runners: past Irish winners include Ronnie Delany (1956‚Äì1959), Eamonn Coghlan (1977, &#x27;79‚Äì&#x27;81, &#x27;83, &#x27;85 and &#x27;87), Marcus O&#x27;Sullivan (1986, &#x27;88‚Äì&#x27;90 and 1992), Niall Bruton (1994 and 1996), and Mark Carroll (2000). Ray Flynn, the Irish record holder in the mile and the current meeting director of the Millrose Games, has also competed in the Wanamaker Mile.

It was at the Millrose Games that Coghlan earned the nickname &quot;Chairman of the Boards&quot; (from the surface of the track being made of wooden boards). O&#x27;Sullivan has run 11 sub-four-minute miles in the Wanamaker.

The Wanamaker Mile has been won by over 40 different men, including Glenn Cunningham, Kip Keino, Tony Waldrop, Filbert Bayi, Steve Scott, Noureddine Morceli, Bernard Lagat, Yared Nuguse, Matthew Centrowitz Jr., Marcus O&#x27;Sullivan, Ron Delany, and Eamonn Coghlan.

== History ==
The Millrose Games were first held in a local armory in 1908, being organized by the employees of the Wanamaker Department Store&#x27;s New York City branch. The employees formed the recreational Millrose Athletic Association. &quot;Millrose&quot; was the name of the country home of Rodman Wanamaker in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania. When this local armory overflowed, the Millrose Games were moved to Madison Square Garden in 1914.

In 1915, the &quot;Wanamaker 2 Mile Race&quot; was held. From 1916 to 1925, the games&#x27; signature event was the 1.5 mile run. In 1925, the last edition of the &quot;Wanamaker 1.5 Mile Race&quot; was won by &quot;Flying Finn&quot; Paavo Nurmi, the nine-time Olympic gold medalist from Finland.

In 1926, the race was shortened to one mile, and thus the Wanamaker Mile was born. The winner of the 1926 race was James J. Connolly, who had represented the United States at the 1920 and 1924 Olympics.

In the 1929 Wanamaker, American athlete Ray Conger became the first and only athlete to defeat and upset &quot;Flying Finn&quot; Paavo Nurmi in the mile. Although Conger was modest about his win, he would be known as &quot;the man who beat Nurmi&quot; for decades.

The first time the Wanamaker Mile was won in a sub-four minute time was by American athlete Tony Waldrop in 1974, in 3:59.7.

The first women&#x27;s race for the Wanamaker Mile was held in 1982, and was won by Mary Decker.

The Wanamaker was once held every year at 10:00 p.m., a tradition started by the legendary sports announcer Ted Husing. Husing would broadcast the race live during the nightly news. In 2002, the mile was moved to 9 p.m. to accommodate television coverage.

Madison Square Garden, which possessed a 146-meter track, was the venue for the race from 1914 until 2012, when it was moved to The Armory in Upper Manhattan, a much faster 200-meter mondo track.

Accompanying this venue change, the Millrose Games and therefore the Wanamaker Mile shifted from a Friday evening format to an all-day Saturday format.

By 2018, the start time had been moved to late afternoon when it was nationally televised live on NBC.

In 2019, Yomif Kejelcha won the Wanamaker in 3:48.46 to miss Hicham El Guerrouj&#x27;s then-world record of 3:48.45 by just one hundredth of a second. Kejelcha would later go on to shatter El Guerrouj&#x27;s indoor mile world record by almost 1.5 seconds at the Bruce Lehane Invitational in Boston, with a time of 3:47.01.

In 2023, Yared Nuguse ran an American record time of 3:47.38 in the Wanamaker, missing Ethiopian athlete Yomif Kejelcha&#x27;s 2019 indoor mile world record of 3:47.01 by .37 seconds. In 2024, Nuguse defended his title (3:47.83), but did not run faster than he did in 2023.

The 2024 edition of the Wanamaker Mile at the 116th Millrose Games was held on Super Bowl Sunday (February 11), at 2:42 pm (women) and 2:53 pm (men).

In the 2025 Wanamaker Mile, Yared Nuguse broke Yomif Kejelcha&#x27;s world record of 3:47.01, clocking a new world record of 3:46.63. Finishing behind Nuguse was Hobbs Kessler in 3:46.90, also under the previous record. Cameron Myers set a world U20 record and Australian record of 3:47.48, while Azeddine Habz set a French record of 3:47.56, and Andrew Coscoran set an Irish record of 3:49.26.

== Sponsors ==
The sponsors of the Wanamaker Mile have varied over the years, with the NYRR often supporting the race.

In 2023, the Rudin family sponsored the event in the 115th Millrose Games.

== Records ==
In 2010, Bernard Lagat surpassed Eamonn Coghlan&#x27;s record of seven Wanamaker Mile victories with his eighth victory. Prior to Coghlan, Glenn Cunningham was among the first men to dominate the event, winning six out of seven Wanamaker Miles from 1933 to 1939.

Mary Decker, Doina Melinte and Regina Jacobs are all tied for most Wanamaker victories on the women&#x27;s side, with three wins each.

The current men&#x27;s event record in the Wanamaker Mile is held by American athlete Yared Nuguse, who ran a world record time of 3:46.63 in the 2025 Wanamaker, improving Ethiopian athlete Yomif Kejelcha&#x27;s 2019 indoor mile world record of 3:47.01 by 0.38 seconds.

The current women&#x27;s event record in the Wanamaker Mile was set in 2024 by American athlete Elinor Purrier, with a time of 4:16.41, also the American record. Purrier had eclipsed her previous 2020 American record time of 4:16.85.

<doc id="620793" wikidata="Q1457873" url="?curid=620793" title="Monster (R.E.M. album)">
<text>Monster is the ninth studio album by American rock band R.E.M., released by Warner Bros. Records in the UK on September¬†26, 1994, and in the United States the following day. It was produced by the band and Scott Litt and recorded at four studios. The album was an intentional shift from the style of the band&#x27;s previous two albums, &quot;Out of Time&quot; (1991) and &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; (1992), by introducing loud, distorted guitar tones and simpler lyrics.

Led by the successful single &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?,&quot; &quot;Monster&quot; debuted at number one in the United States and at least seven other countries, and received generally positive reviews. Four more singles were released from the album, including UK top-20 hits &quot;Bang and Blame,&quot; &quot;Strange Currencies&quot; and &quot;Tongue.&quot; In 1995, the band promoted the album with its first concert tour since 1989. Although the tour was commercially successful, band members suffered several health problems. At the 37th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;Monster&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Album, but lost to The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Voodoo Lounge&quot;. The album&#x27;s follow-up &quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot; (1996) was primarily recorded during the tour.

==Recording==
Early in 1993, R.E.M. convened a four-day meeting in Acapulco to plan their next two years. The group agreed on a plan for 1994 through 1996, which included recording a new album and touring to promote it. Drummer Bill Berry was particularly eager to tour (which the band had not done since 1989), and insisted that the album &quot;rock&quot;. &quot;If we did another record like &quot;Out of Time&quot; or &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;, we&#x27;d be sitting on stools all night and swapping acoustic instruments, and that would be kind of boring,&quot; he said in October 1994. The band agreed that after their previous two albums, they did not want to record another slow-paced album. Frontman Michael Stipe in a 2019 interview with BBC Music viewed the album as an attempt to &quot;reinvent&quot; R.E.M., wanting to do &quot;something that was loud and brash and punk rock.&quot;

Later that year, R.E.M. began recording their ninth album. Pre-production took place at Kingsway Studio in New Orleans under the supervision of Mark Howard, who had worked on &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;. Guitarist Peter Buck said that the band wrote 45 songs, including &quot;a whole album&#x27;s worth of acoustic stuff&quot; which they demoed. According to Howard, the sessions were experimental: &quot;The bass had a tremolo sound on it. It was a more inventive session for them.&quot; The studio did not have a control room, so Howard recorded Michael Stipe singing lyrical ideas while lying on a couch: &quot;Being able to put those vocals down helped him write the lyrics to a lot of songs on &quot;Monster&quot;.&quot; When the sessions were finished Howard played the recordings to co-producer Scott Litt, who had worked with the band since their fifth album (&quot;Document&quot;, 1987).
In February 1994, the band moved to Crossover Soundstage in Atlanta, Georgia. At Crossover, most of the album&#x27;s basic tracks were recorded live as if the band were playing in concert. Litt said, &quot;I thought since they hadn&#x27;t toured in a while, it would be good for them to get into that mind-set‚Äîyou know, monitors, PA, standing up&quot;. The sessions were hampered by several events, including Berry and bassist Mike Mills falling ill on separate occasions, Buck and Stipe leaving to visit family members and the deaths of Stipe&#x27;s friends, Nirvana&#x27;s Kurt Cobain and actor River Phoenix. The band wrote and recorded &quot;Let Me In&quot; in tribute to Cobain and dedicated the album to Phoenix, whose sister Rain provided background vocals on &quot;Bang and Blame&quot;.

In late April 1994 the band relocated to Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, but recording was interrupted because Stipe had an abscessed tooth. Unlike previous album sessions, by the time production moved to Ocean Way Recording in Los Angeles the band was behind schedule. Litt attributed the delay to recording live at Crossover, which lengthened the mixing process; he told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re trying to figure out how raw to leave it and how much to studiofy it.&quot; Stipe was still writing songs when the band was supposed to be mixing the album. Tensions arose among the band members, who were staying in different locations in Los Angeles and would rarely be in the studio at the same time. The situation came to a head when the group was recording at Louie&#x27;s Clubhouse (Litt&#x27;s home studio in Los Angeles); years later, Stipe recalled, &quot;We broke up ... We reached the point where none of us could speak to each other, and we were in a small room, and we just said &#x27;Fuck off&#x27; and that was it.&quot; The group met to resolve their issues; Mills told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;We have to begin working as a unit again, which we haven&#x27;t been doing very well lately.&quot;

==Composition==

Unlike R.E.M.&#x27;s previous two albums, &quot;Monster&quot; incorporated distorted guitar tones, minimal overdubs, and touches of 1970s glam rock. Peter Buck described the album as &quot;a &#x27;rock&#x27; record, with the &#x27;rock&#x27; in quotation marks.&quot; He explained, &quot;That&#x27;s not what we started out to make, but that&#x27;s certainly how it turned out to be. There&#x27;s a nudge, nudge, wink, wink feel to the whole record. Like, it&#x27;s a rock record, but is it really?&quot; Mike Mills told &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;On past albums we had been exploring acoustic instruments, trying to use the piano and mandolin, and we did it about all we wanted to do it. And you come back to the fact that playing loud electric-guitar music is about as fun as music can be.&quot; Stipe&#x27;s vocals were pushed down in the mix. Buck&#x27;s guitar work on the album was inspired by the tremolo-heavy guitar playing of Glen Johansson of Echobelly, who supported R.E.M. on some of the Monster Tour. The album&#x27;s music has been described as grunge, alternative rock, and glam rock. One critic noted its &quot;sloppy lo-fi fun-isms&quot; in contrast to &quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot;. The band has called it a &quot;foxy, in-your-face, punk rock, trashed and stupid&quot; record. &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot;, &quot;Crush with Eyeliner&quot; and &quot;Circus Envy&quot; have been described as glam rock.

Stipe wrote &quot;Monster&quot; lyrics in character; this, according to biographer Dan Buckley, &quot;set the real Stipe at a distance from the mask adopted for each song.&quot; The album dealt with the nature of celebrity and &quot;the creepiness of fandom as pathology&quot;. Buck called the album a reaction to the band&#x27;s popularity: &quot;When I read the lyrics I thought, all these guys are totally fucked up. I don&#x27;t know who they are, because they&#x27;re not Michael. I would say that this was the only time where he&#x27;s done characters that are creepy, and I don&#x27;t know if anyone got that. He was getting out his things by acting out these parts that are not him.&quot; The band noted that at the end of certain songs, they left blank choruses (where Mills and Berry would usually sing harmony) so fans could sing along.
The song &quot;Let Me In&quot; was dedicated to the memory of American musician Kurt Cobain, leader of the grunge band Nirvana, who maintained a close friendship with Stipe. On April¬†5, 1994, during the first recording sessions for &quot;Monster&quot;, he died from a self-inflicted shotgun wound. In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, four months before his death stated:

On the recording of the track, Mills used a Fender Jag-Stang guitar that belonged to Cobain; his widow Courtney Love, leader of the band Hole, gave it to Mills. As Cobain was left-handed and Mills was right-handed, he had to play the guitar backwards. On the other hand, Buck used a Farfisa organ during the recording of the track. Speaking during BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Evening Session Show in 1994, Stipe reflected on how the deaths of Cobain and American actor River Phoenix contributed to the creation of &quot;Monster&quot;: &quot;We feel like we reached a zenith with that record. River&#x27;s death prevented me from being able to write for almost five months. When I did start writing I came up with &#x27;Crush With Eyeliner,&#x27; &#x27;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?,&#x27; &#x27;Circus Envy&#x27; and then when Kurt died halfway through making the record and I just threw my arms up and I had to express the frustration that I had, trying to pull him out of the state of mind he was in and not succeeding you know, I wrote that song (&#x27;Let Me In&#x27;) and we put it on the record&quot;.

==Packaging==
The cover art features a blurred drawing of a bear&#x27;s head against an orange background. The concept originated when Stipe showed cover artist Chris Bilheimer a balloon he wanted to use as the album cover and told him to &quot;play around with&quot;. Bilheimer changed the color of the balloon (which was originally green), and re-photographed the bear head. When he was down to the last few frames on a roll of film, he took a few photos without bothering to focus the shots, which he and Stipe ended up liking the best. The jewel case of the original CD release of &quot;Monster&quot; also featured an orange polystyrene media tray, akin to the yellow one used for the &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; CD. The back cover has the body of the bear next to the track listing, and the inside sleeve features images of the cartoon character Migraine Boy. &quot;I lifted Migraine Boy from the &quot;Flagpole&quot;,&quot; Stipe told Molly McCommons, his 12-year-old interviewer and daughter of &quot;Flagpole&quot; editor Pete McCommons. &quot;I&#x27;d like to officially thank &quot;Flagpole&quot; for introducing me to Greg Fiering and Migraine Boy. I haven&#x27;t met Greg, but I&#x27;ve talked to him a lot on the phone. We were actually in San Francisco at the same time, but I was working on another project and we had a television visit for about two hours. This is an exclusive. I don&#x27;t think anybody else knows about Migraine Boy yet.&quot; The booklet contains several alternate names and working titles of songs recorded for the album. In interviews, the band has described its process of naming albums: they tape a large sheet of paper on the studio wall, and then write down random ideas as they occur. One song mentioned on the list is &quot;Revolution&quot;, an outtake which later appeared on the &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; soundtrack and the bonus disc of &quot;In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988‚Äì2003&quot;. &quot;Yes, I Am Fucking with You&quot; was the working title of &quot;King of Comedy&quot;. The limited-edition deluxe CD was packaged with a 52-page hardcover book of photographs and artwork (including Migraine Boy), similar to the visual extras in other 1980s and 1990s limited-edition R.E.M. albums (which were usually overseen and directed by Stipe). The &quot;Monster&quot; book also included an obi strip and a different design printed on the disc itself, which fitted into a die-cut, star-shaped opening inside the book&#x27;s cover.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Monster&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first week sales of 344,000 copies and sold 131,000 copies in four days to debut at number one on the UK Albums Chart. The album was selling ten times its nearest rival, Massive Attack&#x27;s &quot;Protection&quot;. There were several hits from the album; particularly &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; and &quot;Bang and Blame&quot;, which charted better than any single from &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; in the United States and Canada. These two singles were also successful in the United Kingdom, peaking at number nine and number 15 respectively. &quot;Star 69&quot; also charted, although it was not released as a single. The album was among the first promoted with online content, which was also distributed via floppy disk.

The album was generally praised. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Robert Palmer noted that Stipe&#x27;s lyrics dealt with issues of identity (&quot;The concept of reality itself is being called into question: Is this my life or an incredible virtual simulation?&quot;), and the singer occasionally &quot;begins to sound not unlike the proverbial rock star, whining about all those fans who just won&#x27;t let him alone.&quot; Palmer added, &quot;What&#x27;s truly impressive about &quot;Monster&quot; is the way R.E.M. make an album with such potentially grave subject matter so much fun.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Keith Cameron wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s fun, frequently, but we feel distanced, engaged only on a secondhand level. Moreover, the loudly trumpeted fox factor has been conspicuous by its absence.&quot; According to Cameron, &quot;At best stunning, at worst merely diverting, &quot;Monster&quot; sounds like the album they &#x27;had&#x27; to make, to clear out their system, a simple prop to occupy our time ...&quot; AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, &quot;&quot;Monster&quot; doesn&#x27;t have the conceptual unity or consistently brilliant songwriting of &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;, but it does offer a wide range of sonic textures that have never been heard on an R.E.M. album before.&quot; It was voted number 786 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

In 2005, Warner Bros. released expanded two-disc editions of all the band&#x27;s Warner Bros. studio albums. The &quot;Monster&quot; reissue included a CD, a DVD-Audio disc with a 5.1-channel surround-sound mix of the album, and concert footage from the Monster Tour. The original CD booklet&#x27;s liner notes were expanded with lyrics and a photo gallery.

In November 2011 &quot;Monster&quot; was ranked ninth on &quot;Guitar World&quot; top-ten list of 1994 guitar albums, between Rancid&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; and Tesla&#x27;s &quot;Bust a Nut&quot;. &quot;Guitar World&quot; also included the album on their list &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; originally named it the year&#x27;s second-best album, but dropped it to fifteenth-best in a 2014 re-ranking. &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; was ranked at number 16 of &quot;Paste&quot;‚Ä≥s list of The 20 Best R.E.M. Songs of All Time in 2009, number 11 of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;‚Ä≥s list of R.E.M.‚Äôs Top 20 Songs, and number 19 of ThoughtCo&#x27;s list of the Top 40 Best R.E.M. Songs.

==Promotion==
===Singles===
Between 1994 and 1995, five singles were released to promote the album: &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot;, &quot;Bang and Blame&quot;, &quot;Crush with Eyeliner&quot;, &quot;Strange Currencies&quot; and &quot;Tongue&quot;. The first of them, &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot;, went on sale on September 5, 1994, twenty-two days before the release of &quot;Monster&quot;, and is the lead single from the album. By its release it achieved the top position on &quot;Billboard&quot;‚Ä≥s Alternative Airplay chart, and in Iceland. The following month, on October 31, 1994, &quot;Bang and Blame&quot; was published, which, like the previous single, managed to reach the first position on the Alternative Airplay chart once again. In Canada it was also positioned at the top of &quot;RPM&quot;&#x27;s Canada Top Singles chart. However, &quot;Crush with Eyeliner&quot; failed to be more commercially successful than its predecessors, it reached position 23 on the Official Charts Company list in England and Scotland, while in Australia, Belgium and Ireland it managed to stay in position 55, 45 and 21 respectively. &quot;Strange Currencies&quot; was not commercially successful either, it only reached number 100 on the Australian chart, and on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 it was ranked at position 47. By the time of the release of the last single, &quot;Tongue&quot;, compared to its predecessors, managed to reach a higher position on the Scottish list by topping at number 10, and for Ireland it was ranked 12.

Reception of the five singles was generally positive: Steve Baltin of &quot;Cash Box&quot; rated &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; &quot;Peak of the Week&quot;, saying that it is &quot;a strong song, but it is not so much a single as the introduction to the most anticipated album of the fall. On that level, it&#x27;s a resounding success. The song literally explodes onto the airwaves with an updated version of classic guitar rock before rumbling drums lead the song into Michael Stipe&#x27;s unique vocals. From there, the track winds its way through various rock tempos without ever losing the momentum of its initial burst of energy&quot;, and for &quot;Bang and Blame&quot; he commented: &quot;With a hard-edged guitar melody, vocalist Michael Stipe gets one of his best Monster moments when he sings, ‚ÄúYou kiss on me/don&#x27;t kiss on me/you tug on me don&#x27;t tug on me.‚Äù The propulsive rhythm of this song should also appeal even to non-fans of the group.&quot; Chuck Campbell of &quot;Knoxville News Sentinel&quot; commented that on &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; Buck&#x27;s &quot;powerful but not dirty guitar&quot; is the centerpiece of the &quot;satisfying&quot; first single, and he said the &quot;swaggering&quot; &quot;Crush with Eyeliner&quot; contains &quot;the most confident, fun Michael Stipe attitude.&quot; Andrew Mueller of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote that &quot;Strange Currencies&quot; &quot;puts the accompaniment of &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; through a brutal, cheap amplifier and replaces the universal balm with the humiliating heroism of the unrequited admirer. ‚ÄúFool might be my middle name,‚Äù he sings, gloriously, uselessly in love, ‚ÄúI tripped and I fell... you will be mine.‚Äù Ah, the pathos, the desperate, deceptive joy of it all. Lovely.&quot; Howard Hampton of &quot;Spin&quot; felt it was better than its &quot;emotive predecessor&quot; &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;, describing it as a &quot;tremulous, promising-your-soul&quot; track. For &quot;Tongue&quot; critics praised Stipe&#x27;s falsetto, Paul Evans of Rolling Stone felt that &quot;Stipe&#x27;s Chi-Lites falsetto is a revelation; elsewhere he declaims with clear authority. Stipe said that the song &quot;Its all about cunnilingus.&quot;

===Tour===

Despite their highest chart positions to date in 1991 and 1992, R.E.M. elected not to tour after they found the year-long &quot;Green&quot; tour exhausting. The Monster Tour was the group&#x27;s first outing in six years. The tour, which played arenas and amphitheaters, as well as some stadiums in Europe, began in January 1995 with shows in Australia and Japan and continued throughout Europe and the United States for the rest of the year. Support acts included Sonic Youth, Grant Lee Buffalo, Luscious Jackson and Radiohead. Although the tour was a commercial success, it was difficult for the group. On March 1, Berry collapsed onstage during a performance in Lausanne, Switzerland due to a brain aneurysm. He had surgery immediately, and recovered fully within a month. Berry&#x27;s aneurysm was the beginning of a series of health problems for the band; Mills had surgery to remove an intestinal adhesion in July, and a month later Stipe had emergency surgery to repair a hernia. However, the group composed and debuted a number of new songs on the tour and recorded most of &quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot; (their next album) on the road. They used eight-track recorders to capture the shows, and based the new album on those recordings.

==25th anniversary reissue==
R.E.M. decided to release a 25th anniversary deluxe edition of &quot;Monster&quot; in 2019, after having released such an edition for &quot;Monster&quot;&#x27;s predecessor, &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;, in 2017. The edition contains remastered, live and demo versions of the songs from the album, as well as, unusually, a CD containing a fully remixed version of the album. The remix was the brainchild of original producer Scott Litt, who had long regretted the original mixing job he had done on &quot;Monster&quot;, which involved distortion and vocals low in the mix, in keeping with the grunge style popular at the time. He felt that the tracks were unnecessarily muddy and did not make for a cohesive album, and noted that, at used record stores, he always saw copies of &quot;Monster&quot; that people had given away, and rarely copies of R.E.M.&#x27;s other albums, indicating listener dissatisfaction. For the 25th anniversary remix, Litt made Stipe&#x27;s and others&#x27; vocals more prominent and clearer, removed some instrumental tracks (like the tremolo guitar in the chorus of &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot;), and even used some different vocal takes, for example in &quot;Strange Currencies&quot;. He cited the new version of &quot;Let Me In&quot;, whose vocals are more comprehensible, as &quot;maybe the best example of what&#x27;s going on in the remix, which is simplicity&quot;.

The members of R.E.M., while supportive of the remix, said that they were still happy with the original production, saying that, in Stipe&#x27;s words, it conveyed &quot;exactly who we were at that moment in time.&quot; The music website &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was critical of the remix, writing, &quot;the inescapable excess of Buck‚Äôs guitar tone as well as the slipperiness of Stipe‚Äôs vocals are what make the record special; when you invert these effects, it starts to be indistinguishable from any other R.E.M. record.&quot;

<text>Richard R. Harris (born March 13, 1969), better known by his nickname, Ross Harris, is an American actor, artist, and musician.

==Early life==
Richard R. Harris was born in Ventura, California.

==Career==
===Acting===
He began acting at age six. He appeared in over 100 commercials in the 1970s. In 1979, at the age of 10, Ross landed the role of Joey in the classic comedy feature film &quot;Airplane!&quot;, notably in a scene with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Peter Graves. Ross went on to co-star in the Academy Award-nominated drama &quot;Testament&quot; as well as roles on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, &quot;T.J. Hooker&quot;, and many more.

In March 1985, he replaced Chad Lowe in the starring role on the NBC sitcom &quot;Spencer&quot;, which was retooled following Lowe&#x27;s sudden departure; it returned under the new title &quot;Under One Roof&quot;. Harris also appeared, as &quot;Ross Angeles&quot;, on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Jackass&quot;, in the &quot;Big Wheel Craze&quot; segment, alongside friend Dave England.

===Music, photography, and video career===
Harris was part of the Camarillo, California space-age electronic 1990s music act Sukia. Taking their name from an X-rated Italian comic book of the same name, Sukia was notable for their crazy, often perverse live shows, which sometimes featured a naked saxophone player. Sukia toured the world with acts like Beck and Stereolab, and subsequently put out one album on the Dust Brothers&#x27; fledgling label Nickel Bag Records in 1997. The album, &quot;Contacto Espacial con el Tercer Sexo&quot; (&quot;Space Contact with the Third Sex&quot;), was produced by the Dust Brothers and Jerry Finn.

After Sukia dissolved, Harris formed DJ Me DJ You with Sukia cohort Craig Borrell. More sample-heavy and straightforward musically than Sukia, DJ Me DJ You relied on sampling from their endless collection of obscure records along with live instrumentation as the basis of their songs. They put out two records, &quot;Rainbows and Robots&quot; (2000) on Emperor Norton Records and &quot;Can You See the Music&quot; (2003) on Eenie Meenie Records.

Amidst musical projects, Harris also worked as a music video director and photographer. He directed two music videos for Elliott Smith ‚Äì one for &quot;Coming Up Roses&quot;, from Smith&#x27;s 1995 self-titled album, and another for Smith&#x27;s Academy Award-nominated song &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, from the &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; soundtrack. (Harris also directed the music video for the song &quot;Plainclothes Man&quot; by Heatmiser, Smith&#x27;s previous band.) Harris was the photographer for Beck&#x27;s first two albums and performed on them as well, including the Grammy-winning &quot;Odelay&quot;.

These successes allowed him to begin yet another career as a record producer, recording works for Virgin, Capitol, and PolyGram. As a remixer, he has worked for Beth Orton, Beck, The Dust Brothers, The Prodigy, Fantastic Plastic Machine, and many others. His music has been featured on &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, &quot;Roswell&quot;, and &quot;Kissing Jessica Stein&quot;.

As a performer with both Sukia and DJ Me DJ You, he has traveled as far as Moscow and Tokyo to play to a growing underground audience.

2003 saw the release of the feature film &quot;Southlander: Diary of a Desperate Musician&quot;, co-written with director Steve Hanft. In addition to Harris&#x27; role as &quot;Ross Angeles&quot;, it stars Rory Cochrane, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, Laura Prepon, Beck, Hank Williams III, and features the final recorded live performance of jazz drummer Billy Higgins.

Harris spearheaded the benefit album &quot;Dimension Mix&quot;, which pays tribute to children&#x27;s electronic music pioneers Bruce Haack and Esther Nelson. The album was a culmination of over 5 years of work for Harris, who produced and compiled the project. It features a song by Beck, which Harris produced and engineered. The project also includes songs and remixes by Stereolab, Eels, Money Mark, The Apples in Stereo, and many more. All proceeds from the album go to &quot;Cure Autism Now&quot;.

Harris works as a director, editor, and director of photography. He has contributed to advertising campaigns for Honda, Acura, Ray-Ban, Levi&#x27;s, and the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba&quot;.

<text>Karl Eduard Wilhelm Groener (; 22 November 1867¬†‚Äì 3 May 1939) was a German general and politician. His organisational and logistical abilities resulted in a successful military career before and during World War I.

After a confrontation with Erich Ludendorff the Quartermaster general () of the German Army, Groener was reassigned to a field command. When Ludendorff was dismissed in October 1918, Groener succeeded him. Groener worked with the new Social Democratic president Friedrich Ebert to foil a left-wing take-over during the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19. Under his command, the army bloodily suppressed popular uprisings throughout Germany.

Groener tried to integrate the military, which was dominated by an aristocratic and monarchistic officer corps, into the new republic. After resigning from the army in the summer of 1919, Groener served in several governments of the Weimar Republic as minister of transportation, interior and defence. He was pushed out of the government in 1932 by Kurt von Schleicher, who was working on a pact with the Nazis.

==Early life==
Wilhelm Groener was born in Ludwigsburg in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg as the son of Karl Eduard Groener (1837‚Äì1893), regimental paymaster, and his wife Auguste (n√©e Boleg, 1825‚Äì1907) on 22 November 1867. After attending gymnasium at Ulm and Ludwigsburg, where his father had been stationed, Groener entered the of the W√ºrttemberg Army in 1884. In 1890, he was promoted to and from 1893 to 1896 attended the War Academy at Berlin, where he finished top of his class. In 1899, Groener married Helene Geyer (1864‚Äì1926) in Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd. They had a daughter, Dorothea Groener-Geyer (b.1900).

==Military career==

===Pre-war===
As a captain, he won appointment to the General Staff in 1899 and was attached to the railway section, where he worked for the next 17 years. This was only interrupted for the usual assignments to other locations, from 1902 to 1904 he was of Infantry Regiment 98 at Metz, from 1908 to 1910 he was with the XIII Army Corps and in 1910 he became a battalion commander in Infantry Regiment 125 at Stuttgart. In 1912, as a lieutenant-colonel, Groener became head of the railway section at the General Staff. His plans for the extension of the railway network and for deployment routes were based the deployment plans of Alfred von Schlieffen, the Chief of the General Staff of the German Army from 1891 to 1906.

===World War I===

The deployment of millions of troops to the frontier by rail boosted Groener&#x27;s reputation and he received numerous decorations in 1914. In June 1915, he was promoted to . Due to his organisational skills, in December 1915 Groener was put in charge of food deliveries from Romania. In May 1916, he joined the leadership of the newly created (War Food Ministry). In November 1916, as a he became head of the (War Office) the department that managed the war economy and deputy of the Prussian Minister of War.

With Erich Ludendorff, Groener worked on the draft for the &quot;Hilfsdienstgesetz&quot; (Auxiliary Services Act, 1916), which laid down the conscription of men () for the war economy. Groener negotiated with the civilian bureaucracy, unions and representatives of the employers. Despite his efforts to appear neutral to maximise output, he became the target of criticism. Factory owners resented him for accepting the unions as partners. Revolutionary groups used his strict admonishments against those who went on strike while soldiers died at the front to undermine his standing with the workers. The negotiations made the limits of Germany military power obvious to Groener and he began to doubt that Germany could win the war. This caused confrontations with the third &quot;Oberste Heeresleitung&quot; (OHL, the supreme command of the German army), led by Paul Hindenburg and Ludendorff. During the change at the in July 1917, when Georg Michaelis replaced Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg as Chancellor, Groener suggested that the state should intervene to limit corporate profits and the wage growth that resulted from booming war-related public demand. On 16 August 1917 he was recalled from his post and reassigned to an operational command. This was seen by the public as a response to his views on social policy.

Groener served for six months at the western front first as the commander of the 33rd Division, and then of the XXV Reserve Corps, where he was able to observe trench warfare and the mood of the troops. In March 1918, he commanded the I Corps during the occupation of Ukraine. On 28 March, he was appointed chief of staff of the army group &quot;Heeresgruppe Eichhorn-Kiew&quot;. This task required him to deal with organisational and political challenges, in particular confrontations with the army high command of Austria-Hungary and supervising, then reshuffling, the Ukrainian government which needed help against Bolshevik revolutionaries.

===End of the war and German revolution===
After the dismissal of Erich Ludendorff on 26 October 1918, Groener was recalled and on 29 October appointed as Ludendorff&#x27;s successor as First Quartermaster General (Deputy Chief of the General Staff) under Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg. The military situation was becoming untenable and social unrest and rebellion in the German armed forces and the civilian population threatened to break out into revolution. Groener started to prepare the withdrawal and demobilisation of the army. As the revolution spread through Germany in early November, Groener began to see the Emperor, Wilhelm II, as an impediment to saving the monarchy and the integrity of the army. Privately, he felt the Kaiser should sacrifice himself in a hero&#x27;s death at the front.

On 6 November, Groener reacted indignantly when the Social Democrat Friedrich Ebert suggested that the Kaiser should abdicate. On 9 November, when the Kaiser suggested using the army to crush the revolution at home, Groener advised him to abdicate, because he had lost the confidence of the armed forces. Groener&#x27;s goal was to preserve the monarchy, but under a different ruler. He was also in favour of accepting the armistice conditions put to the German government, despite their severe nature.

On the evening of 10 November, Groener contacted the new chancellor, Friedrich Ebert, and concluded the Ebert-Groener pact, which was to remain secret for a number of years. Ebert agreed to suppress the Bolshevik revolutionaries and to maintain the traditional role of the armed forces as a pillar of the German state; Groener promised that the army would support the new government. For this act, Groener earned the enmity of many other military leaders, many of whom sought the retention of the monarchy.

Groener oversaw the retreat and demobilisation of the defeated German army after the signing of the armistice on 11 November 1918. Despite a very tight schedule, the withdrawal was effected without problems. Groener organised the defence of the eastern borders of the until a peace treaty could be signed. The headquarters of OHL, at Schloss Wilhelmsh√∂he from 14 November 1918 to 13 February 1919, was moved to Kolberg. Groener also planned for and expected the German peacetime army to be built up to 300,000 in the coming years, a plan that would be ruined by the Treaty of Versailles.

On 23 June 1919, Ebert asked OHL for an opinion on whether the should sign the Treaty of Versailles. Groener supported signing as he was worried that the unity of the would be in danger if fighting was resumed, contradicting the officer corps and the views of Walther Reinhardt, the Prussian Minister of War. Hindenburg followed Groener on this issue and when Hindenburg resigned, Groener succeeded him. Groener, who expected to be made a scapegoat, began actively cooperating in this process to save the popular von Hindenburg&#x27;s reputation, something Ebert immediately noticed. OHL was dissolved as a condition of the treaty, and Groener temporarily took over command at Kolberg. He started to organise the establishment of the new peacetime (), arguing in favour of a high share of former general staff officers among the new leadership, including in the . He also supported a senior position for Hans von Seeckt. On 30 September, Groener resigned from the army, against the wishes of Ebert; Groener felt that his pact with the Social Democrats had cost him the trust of many of his fellow officers.

==Political career==
After his resignation from the army, Groener moved in and out of retirement during the 1920s. Not a member of any party, at Ebert&#x27;s request he served as Minister of Transport between 1920 and 1923. His main achievement was the rebuilding of the . In 1923, when the Cuno government resigned, Groener left politics and wrote military and political treatises, such as (1927). Hindenburg, Ebert&#x27;s successor as , appointed Groener as the successor of Otto Ge√üler as Minister of Defence on 20 January 1928, a post he held until 1932. Besides expanding the , Groener made an effort to integrate it into the society of the Weimar Republic. In 1930, Groener married Ruth Naeher-Gl√ºck (born 1894) in Berlin and had a son. This second marriage and the early birth date of his son undermined Groener&#x27;s relationship with the conservative Hindenburg.

On 8 October 1931 he became acting Interior Minister in the government of Heinrich Br√ºning and favoured the banning of the Nazi (SA storm troops). As Interior Minister he was asked to outlaw the SA, whilst his goal as Defence Minister was to integrate it into a national, non-partisan paramilitary force. In April 1932, under pressure from several German states, Groener outlawed the SA and (SS). Kurt von Schleicher, his subordinate at the wanted to set up a cooperation with the two groups and worked on Hindenburg, to have Groener dismissed. He also allied himself with the NSDAP. After a rhetorical defeat in the , Groener resigned on 13 May as Defence Minister, urged by Schleicher who told Groener that he had lost the trust of the . When the Br√ºning government fell on 30 May, Groener also lost his position as and left politics for good.

Groener moved to Potsdam-Bornstedt in 1934, where he wrote his memoirs, . Groener died of natural causes in Bornstedt on 3 May 1939. He is buried in the Stahnsdorf South-Western Cemetery, located between Potsdam and Berlin.

The post of Prime Minister of Sweden was introduced in 1876 and continued to rise in importance until the breakthrough of parliamentarism in the 1910s. King Gustaf V of Sweden acceded to the throne in 1907 and became the last king that tried to influence government politics in 1914. In 1921 universal suffrage was introduced and Sweden achieved full parliamentary democracy.

He became more widely known in 1985 when, at the age of eight, he appeared in &quot;Witness&quot;. His performance as an Amish boy who is the sole witness to a police officer&#x27;s murder was well received by critics. Haas followed this with roles in films, such as &quot;Solarbabies&quot; (1986) and &quot;Lady in White&quot; (1988).

<text>Philip Anglim is an American actor. He is best known for his performance as John Merrick in the stage and television versions of &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, a role for which he received a Best Actor nomination in the 1979 Tony Awards. Other notable roles include the title role in &quot;Macbeth&quot; on Broadway and Dane O&#x27;Neill, the ill-fated love child who grew up to follow in his unknown father&#x27;s footsteps on the path to the priesthood in the television mini-series &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;. He also had a recurring guest role as the Bajoran priest Vedek Bareil on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;.

==Biography==
Anglim&#x27;s father, a Catholic of Irish descent, worked as a patent attorney, and his mother, Paule Anglim, was of French-Jewish descent and was a San Francisco art dealer. He originally aspired to become a veterinarian, but after he was asked to appear in a play by one of his teachers, he switched to acting. Anglim graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English literature from Yale University in 1973. Subsequently, Anglim spent a year in Connecticut at the Southbury Playhouse.

His feature film debut was in &quot;The All-American Boy&quot; (1973), and his first television appearance was in the PBS &quot;The Adams Chronicles&quot; (1976). In 1979, while still an unknown, Anglim optioned the London play &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, and debuted off-Broadway at St. Peter&#x27;s Church. It later moved to The Booth Theater on Broadway in 1979, and earned several awards. He performed as Macbeth on Broadway in 1981 (in which he was replaced by Kelsey Grammer) and again on TV in 1982. In 1982, Anglim appeared in the ABC television version of &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, and earned an Emmy nomination for Best Actor for the performance.

Anglim also maintains a cattle farm in Tennessee, and in 1992, founded The Lewis County Children&#x27;s Fund to help children in the area.

<doc id="620809" wikidata="Q1493854" url="?curid=620809" title="Gap year">
<text>A gap year, also known as a sabbatical year, is a period of time when students take a break from their studies, usually after completing high school or before beginning graduate school. During this time, students engage in a variety of educational and developmental activities, such as traveling, working, volunteering, or taking courses. Gap years are not limited to a year-long break and can range from several months to a few years.

The activities undertaken during a gap year vary widely and depend on the individual&#x27;s interests and goals. Some students may take courses to improve their academic skills in areas such as math or language studies, while others may learn a trade, pursue art, or participate in sports. Volunteer work is also a popular choice, as it allows students to give back to their communities and gain valuable experience.

Research suggests that students who take a gap year tend to perform better academically than those who do not. However, some parents may worry that their children will continue deferring their education, rather than resuming studies at the end of the initially-planned period.

==Description==
A gap year is described as ‚Äúa semester or year of experiential learning, typically taken after high school, and prior to career or post-secondary education, in order to deepen one‚Äôs practical, professional, and personal awareness.‚Äù During this time, students engage in various educational, work-related, and developmental activities such as internships, work experience, travel, volunteering, participation in cultural exchanges, studying art or learning a trade, etc. Though gap years come in many different formats ‚Äì from structured programs to personal exploration ‚Äì the purpose of taking a gap year is usually founded on the common needs of young people to gain deeper self-understanding, expand their worldview, and recharge between traditional academic experiences. On the other hand, rejected college or employment applications have also caused high school students to pursue a gap year.

Taking a gap year can have significant benefits to one&#x27;s academic path as well as a career trajectory. This time taken off can help college students from ‚Äúburning out‚Äù or turning to indulgent behaviors as a result of unhealthy stress. During this year, students can explore different interests while gaining experience and maturity before beginning college. It gives young people the time to make an informed choice about the path they wish to pursue, as well as the experience of real-world situations to match academic theories. Gap years and similar sabbatical experiences are popular around the world (as can be evidenced below per country), but are just beginning to become more popular in the United States. Studies conducted by American colleges are showing that the average GPA for students who have taken a gap year is significantly higher than the average GPA for students who have not. Amidst much evidence supporting the positive outcomes of taking a gap year, the room for improvement remains ‚Äì as the gap year experience is largely geared primarily toward students with ‚Äúmeans.‚Äù Some still argue an opposing view, as parents are among the concerned that taking a year off from school has the potential to break a student&#x27;s focus and derail their path rather than recharge it. Ultimately though, the idea of a gap year is growing as it helps students gain the independence necessary for a smoother transition into adulthood.

==History==
Gap years first became common in the 1960s when the young, baby boom generation, wanted to get away from the severity of war from the silent generation. At first, the primary purpose of the gap year was for countries to exchange cultural ideals in the hope of preventing future wars. The outcome of this exchange was the growth of the gap year industry.

The introduction of gap-year companies in the 1960s and 1970s started the gap-year industry. With the long-term success of organizations like Topdeck, Flight Centre, and Raleigh International, the gap year industry developed rapidly. In 1967, Nicholas Maclean-Bristol created Project Trust, which sent three volunteers to Ethiopia from the UK. The goal of this was to help the nation develop, but also build the volunteers&#x27; own skills. In 1972, Gap Activity Projects (now Lattitude Global Volunteering) was started to send UK youth around the world on Gap Year experiences. Their participants, still called &quot;Gappers&quot;, went a long way to branding the year between high school and university as a Gap Year. In 1973, Graham Turner innovated the gap year industry by purchasing a bus and selling tickets to Kathmandu. This led to Turner creating Topdeck and Flight Centre, which are successful gap-year companies today. In 1978, the Prince of Wales and Colonel John Blashford-Snell began Operation Drake which is now known as Raleigh International, an expedition voyage around the world following Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s route.

In 1969, the first gap year organization was founded in Worcester, Massachusetts. The organization called Dynamy was founded with the intention of teaching young people self-confidence and the role they play in a large community. In the 1980s, the gap year idea was promoted by Cornelius H. Bull in the United States to allow students more time for individual growth. Cornelius saw that students needed a bridge between high school and college that would help develop more hands-on skills. To do this, he founded the Center for Interim Programs in 1980 which had goals of increasing self-awareness and developing new cultural perspectives.

The modern Gap Year pioneers came in the form of Peter Pedrick and Tom Griffiths who brought the gap year market onto the web in 1998 with the launch of gapyear.com. They created one of the first social media websites and actively promoted the concept in newspapers, radio and tv interviews using collected data and statistics. They wrote books, launched Gap Year magazine (published between 2002-2012) and invented products, offerings, phrases and concepts that form the skeleton of the international gap year industry seen today.

==Advantages and Disadvantages==
===Advantages===
Personal Growth: Students often participate in destructive behaviors when they feel they have no purpose in their education. Gap years can allow students to gain experience and develop clear goals for their future. 

Academic Performance: Students who take gap years often perform better academically, with benefits lasting throughout their academic careers.

Career Readiness: Gap years offer practical experiences that can help students clarify career goals. Internships, volunteer work, or job opportunities can also provide students with a competitive advantage in the admissions process. The Gap Year Association even reports that 90% of gap year participants reported that their experience helped them develop &quot;critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills,&quot; all of which are valuable for any career path. 

===Disadvantages===
Financial Constraints: Gap years can be very expensive. Travel, program fees, and living expenses can accumulate quickly, making this an option inaccessible for low income families. 

Loss of Academic Momentum: Without a properly structured gap year, individuals may waste their year with little productivity. Taking a year off from academics could easily result in students losing the habits they create while in high school, leading to poor performance in college due to an inability to reintegrate into a more structured academic environment. 

Delayed Graduation and Entry into Workforce: A gap year typically delays graduation and entry into the job market, which may be a disadvantage for some students who need to start their careers sooner. Some believe that this delay may hurt students in the long term. 

==By country==
===Australia and New Zealand===
Australians and New Zealanders have a tradition of traveling overseas independently at a young age. In New Zealand, this is known as &quot;doing an OE&quot; (Overseas experience). Sometimes this is limited to one year, but at times Australians and New Zealanders will remain overseas for longer, many working short-term in service industry jobs to fund their travels. Europe and Asia are popular destinations for gap year travels. In Australia, exchange programs and youth benefits provide many opportunities for young people to gain experience through travel in a gap year. The Gap Year Association provided approximately four million dollars in 2016 in the form of scholarships and need-based grants.

===Denmark===
In Denmark, during the late 1990s, the percentage of students continuing their education directly after high school was down to 25%. Along with this drop, there was a rise in the number of students enrolling and graduating within ten years of finishing high school. Data also shows that women in Denmark take more gap years than men. In 2018, a record low of 15% of that year&#x27;s high school graduates had chosen to continue their education directly after graduation.

Denmark has sought to limit the number of students who take a year out, penalizing students who delay their education to travel abroad or work full-time. In 2006, it was announced that fewer students than before had taken a year out. In April 2009, the Danish government proposed a new law that gives a bonus to students who refrain from a year out.

===Ghana===
In Ghana, most senior high school leavers have a year out from August to the August of the following year, although this is not mandatory. 

===Ireland===
Transition Year in Ireland is for school students, after taking the Junior Certificate (i.e. typically aged 15-16). It is usually optional and focuses on non-academic subjects.

===Israel===
In Israel, it is customary for young adults who have completed their mandatory military service to engage in backpacker tourism abroad in groups before starting university or full-time work ().

Israel has also become a popular gap year travel destination for thousands of young Jewish adults from abroad each year. There are over 10,000 participants in the Masa Israel Journey gap year annually.

===Japan===
The employment practice known as simultaneous recruiting of new graduates matches students with jobs before graduation, meaning sabbaticals are highly unusual in Japan. 

While unusual, gap years in Japan are not completely unheard of. Some students will take a gap year or two to readjust or reassess their career path or school of choice if not accepted into the school they had originally hoped for.

===Nigeria===
While waiting for their JAMB result after secondary school, Nigerian youths usually learn a trade or skill or enrol in another academic program (remedial, pre-degree, JUPEB, A-levels, IJMB, etc.) to increase their chances of getting into a university. Some students also use this opportunity to write their SAT and ACT exams and gain admission into schools abroad. 

===Norway===

It is quite normal in Norway to have a gap year between high school and further education or a job. Some join the military as part of the compulsory military service, some take part in Folkeh√∏yskole (Folk high school) and some are combining work (typically work that requires no formal education, such as cashiers and waiters) with traveling or volunteer work. It is also fairly common to study a language in another country, for instance, Spain, France, or Australia.

===Romania and Bulgaria===

Similar to the way that some students travel during a gap year, many Romanian and Bulgarian students instead study abroad and in recent years the number of students who choose to do this has been growing.

===South Africa===
In the Republic of South Africa, taking a year off is common for those in more affluent classes. Those who leave school often travel abroad to gain life experience. It is not uncommon for gap year students to travel to Cape Town for life experience. Common volunteer opportunities include working in animal welfare or tree planting.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the practice of taking a gap year ‚Äì seen as an interim period of 7 or 8 months between completing secondary education and starting university ‚Äì began to develop in the 1970s. The period was seen as a time for gaining life experience through travel or volunteering. Universities appear to welcome post-gap-year applicants on the same basis as those going straight to university from previous education.

Shorter gap-style experiences (volunteering, expeditions, courses, and work placements) are gaining in popularity, as they can be taken without the need to take a full year out of study or work.

A kind of a gap year after university graduation in the UK was short-term voluntary military service as a commissioned officer: &quot;Short Service Limited Commission&quot; was introduced at the end of the 1970s when many units were short of young officers. In 1999 the name was changed to &quot;Gap Year Commission&quot;. It was discontinued in 2007.

===United States===
In the United States, the practice of taking a &quot;year off&quot; remains the exception, but is gaining in popularity. Parents are starting to encourage their high school graduates to take a gap year to focus on service opportunities. Schools are also beginning to support gap years more; most notably Harvard University and Princeton University, are now encouraging students to take time off, and some have even built gap year-like programs into the curriculum, and many high schools now have counselors specifically for students interested in taking a gap year.

Taking a year off has recently become slightly more common for Americans, the main reason is that students often feel burnt out with schooling and want to take time to make sure their lives are headed in a direction that suits them. Some 40,000 Americans participated in 2013 in sabbatical programs, an increase of almost 20% since 2006, according to statistics compiled by the American Gap Association. Universities such as Georgetown University, New York University, Amherst College, Princeton University, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Middlebury College, Davidson College, Yeshiva University, and Reed College have formal policies allowing students to defer admission.

Tufts University offers a program called 1+4 which allows students from lower income-families to volunteer abroad or within America for a period of one year before starting their bachelor&#x27;s degree. Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, is the first U.S. university to fully integrate the gap year into a four-year undergraduate degree, which makes financial aid directly available to any student considering a gap year.

Some formal gap year programs can cost as much as $30,000, but cheaper alternatives are becoming more widely available; some reduce costs by offering room and board. For example, the National Civilian Community Corps, an AmeriCorps program, offers 18- to 24-year-olds (no age limit for Team Leaders) an all-expense-paid gap year (room &amp; board, meals, transportation, etc.) in exchange for a 10-month commitment to National and Community service. AmeriCorps NCCC members travel the country in diverse teams and perform a variety of tasks such as rebuilding trails in national parks, responding to natural disasters, or working as mentors for disadvantaged youths. As with most AmeriCorps programs, service members receive an education award of approximately $6,000 upon completion of their service that can be used toward qualified educational expenses or student loans. The zero cost to the member model AmeriCorps offers makes it an attractive alternative to costly gap year programs while leveraging taxpayer dollars to strengthen American communities.

Additionally, new federal partnerships such as FEMA Corps offer traditional gap year seekers an immersive professional and team-building experience that can serve as a launch pad for their careers. Some government programs designed to help students afford college prohibit students from taking a gap year. For example, the Tennessee Promise program requires that students must &quot;Attend full-time and continuously at an eligible postsecondary institution as defined in T.C.A. ¬ß 49-4-708 in the fall term immediately following graduation or attainment of a GED or HiSET diploma; except that a student enrolling in a Tennessee College of Applied Technology (TCAT) may enroll in the summer prior to the fall term.&quot; Malia Obama, daughter of former President Barack Obama, took a gap year before attending Harvard University in the fall of 2017. Universities such as Harvard and Princeton are encouraging students to take a Gap year. This time that is taken off can be beneficial so students don&#x27;t &quot;burn out&quot; or partake in indulging behaviors that promote unhealthy stress.

===Yemen===
In Yemen, a gap year is mandatory between secondary school (high school) and university. Unless one attends a private university, one must wait one year after secondary school before applying to university. Until the 1990s, it was mandatory for male graduates serve in the army for one year, and to teach in a school or work in a hospital for female graduates (and for men who cannot join the army for health reasons).

<doc id="620812" wikidata="Q1028497" url="?curid=620812" title="Camelot Group">
<text>The Camelot Group was an operator of lotteries, particularly the UK National Lottery from 1994 to 2024.

It has also operated the Illinois State Lottery in the state of Illinois in the United States since 2018. The Camelot Group companies, of which Camelot UK Lotteries Limited is the UK National Lottery operating subsidiary, are owned by the holding company Premier Lotteries Investments UK Limited. The group&#x27;s ultimate parent was the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan, a Canadian investment fund until 2023 when Allwyn AG purchased Camelot.

==History==
=== UK development ===
Camelot was formed as a consortium to bid for the National Lottery project. The major partners were International Computers Limited (ICL), supplying hardware, software, and systems integration expertise; Racal with responsibility for the communications network; and Cadbury Schweppes bringing experience in consumer marketing and knowledge of the world of corner-shop retailers. De La Rue brought knowledge of secure printing technology, and GTECH Corporation were brought in as the selected supplier of applications software. Staff were seconded from the partner companies, transferring to Camelot Group when the bid was won.

Senior executives such as Tim Holley were enticed to join the project by the promise of large bonuses if the bid was successful. This caused embarrassment later when the incoming Labour government, in particular Chris Smith, the Culture Secretary, publicly criticised Camelot and its executives for excessively lavish salaries and bonus payments.

The Camelot Group was awarded the National Lottery franchise in May 1994. It won the bid against Sir Richard Branson who proposed to create a not-for-profit structure, an idea that didn&#x27;t seduce the Gambling Commission.

The Camelot name is reflected in the actual lottery machines used in the National Lottery draw, which are named for characters, places, and objects in Arthurian Legend (Guinevere, Lancelot, Excalibur, Arthur, etc.).

In 2004, the transnational lottery EuroMillions entered the UK lottery market.

Camelot&#x27;s third licence period started on 31 January 2009; the money given to good causes was increased, and retailers&#x27; commission increased from 5% to 6%. The third licence was for a ten-year period with the option to extend by a further five years. In March 2009, Camelot announced a programme of redundancies to cut costs throughout the company.

In March 2012, the National Lottery Commission extended Camelot&#x27;s Licence by four years to 2023, on condition that Camelot deliver an additional ¬£1.7 billion in lottery funding to good causes.

In October 2013, Camelot doubled the ticket price of its main National Lottery game, Lotto, to ¬£2, with the aim of increasing ticket sales. Analysts noted that in the subsequent two-year period, funds raised for good causes by the National Lottery fell by ¬£100 million.

In November 2017, Nigel Railton was named CEO of the Camelot group in amidst falling lottery ticket sales. He was previously the company&#x27;s finance director, and had served as interim CEO since the departure of Andy Duncan in April 2017.

The Watford headquarters was previously the site of a Scammell Lorries Limited factory.

=== International development ===
In March 2010, Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan from Canada bought Camelot for ¬£389 million.

In October 2013, Premier Lotteries Ireland, a consortium including the Camelot Group with An Post, won the licence to run Ireland&#x27;s lottery for 20 years until 2034.

In January 2018, the Camelot group became the new operator of the Illinois State Lottery in the United States. The state of Illinois was the first in the US to privatize its lottery system.

===Loss of licence===
A franchise renewal competition was started in 2019 and Camelot group faced multiple competing bids to maintain the contract, including one from Northern &amp; Shell (operator of The Health Lottery).

In March 2022 the Gambling commission announced that Camelot&#x27;s National Lottery licence would not be renewed, and the franchise was awarded instead to Allwyn Entertainment Ltd, an international lottery operator owned by the Czech billionaire Karel Kom√°rek. Camelot was held as the &#x27;reserve applicant&#x27;.

In November 2022, it was announced Allwyn Entertainment Ltd. had acquired Camelot UK Lotteries Limited from the Ontario Teachers‚Äô Pension Plan. The acquisition was completed in February 2023, after the deal was approved by the United Kingdom Gambling Commission. Although Allwyn did not disclose the exact value of the acquisition, it was estimated at 100 million pounds.

== Earnings ==
In 2017/18, the average pound (100p) spent on the National Lottery was distributed as follows:

*55p Prize fund (50p in 2005)
*24p Good causes (28p in 2005)
*12p Government (12p in 2005)
* 4p Retailers (5p in 2005)
* 5p Camelot (5p in 2005)
** 4.5p Camelot for operating costs
** 0.5p Camelot for profit

According to the Camelot Group, the UK Lottery created 30 millionaires every month.

== Controversies ==

=== 2000/2001 franchise controversy ===
Two companies competed for the National Lottery franchise in 2001: Camelot, the incumbent operator, and a rival operator called &quot;The People&#x27;s Lottery&quot;, organised by Sir Richard Branson.

During the 2000 franchise bidding process, a technical problem with lottery terminals supplied by American company GTECH Corporation came to light. It was discovered that this technical problem may have inadvertently caused winners to be paid incorrect amounts. Because of this problem and the relationship between Camelot and GTECH, the National Lottery Commission recommended that the lottery franchise be awarded to the People&#x27;s Lottery. GTECH had been a shareholder in Camelot Group but they sold their shareholding to the remaining shareholders, who increased their stakes from 16.66% to 20%.

In August 2000, the chair of the National Lottery Commission, Dame Helena Shovelton, announced that neither party would be invited to run the National Lottery, claiming that neither party met the statutory requirements to run the lottery. It was felt that legal problems were responsible for the downfall of the People&#x27;s Lottery bid, while the relationship between G-Tech and Camelot was the reason Camelot would not be invited to run the lottery.

By September 2000, it was clear that although neither party met the statutory requirements to run the lottery, the commission was going to award the franchise to the People&#x27;s Lottery. Camelot initiated legal action, taking the commission to the high court for a judicial review. The High Court judges sided with Camelot, describing the commission&#x27;s decision as &quot;conspicuously unfair&quot;. The National Lottery Commission responded by dismissing the HM Treasury legal team who had been advising them. Dame Helena resigned shortly afterwards and was replaced by Lord Burns.

During November, the National Lottery Commission reopened the bidding process and both parties resubmitted their bids, the commission hoped to announce the winner by mid-December. On 19 December 2000 the commission announced that Camelot would be awarded the franchise, with voting 4‚Äì1 in favor of Camelot. One member later resigned from the commission over the process, deeply unhappy that Camelot had been re-awarded the franchise. Sir Richard Branson threatened to take further legal action; but due to the prospect of a lengthy and costly legal battle, one which could have resulted in the National Lottery games being suspended, he did not proceed with the action.

The governmental body the Gambling Commission is responsible for deciding who is awarded the franchise. The way the franchise was awarded to Camelot in 2001 caused some controversy, because state-owned Royal Mail held a 20% stake in the Camelot Group.

===2009 ticket fraud===
In 2009 Giles Knibbs, a Camelot employee, conspired with a member of the public, Edward Putman, to claim a jackpot prize using a bogus ticket. Knibbs, who worked in Camelot&#x27;s fraud department, found a way to forge lottery tickets bearing unclaimed winning numbers. Putman, of Kings Langley in Hertfordshire, was initially prosecuted in July 2012 for benefit fraud after failing to declare lottery winnings of ¬£5 million whilst in receipt of welfare benefits.

Putman refused to give Knibbs ¬£1m they had agreed, and had him arrested after a row over their agreement. Putman charged him with criminal damage, burglary and blackmail. In October 2015 Knibbs took his own life, fearful of repercussions over his actions.

Although police did not have enough evidence to bring a prosecution against Putman at the time, the case was investigated by the Gambling Commission in December 2016, who found that Camelot had breached the terms of its operating licence in failing to investigate the veracity of the prize claim before paying out and fined Camelot ¬£3 million. The case was subsequently investigated further and in October 2019 Putman was jailed for 9 years for defrauding the National Lottery of ¬£2.5 million.

=== 2018 failings fine ===
In August 2018, the Camelot Group was fined ¬£1.15 million by the Gambling Commission because of the malfunctioning mobile app launched by the group, and for failing to publish a complete raffle prize list. Among other things, the mobile app would apply a non-winning label on a user&#x27;s winning numbers. The Commission fined Camelot for five major failings, and observed 10 other failings that did not lead to further penalties. The Camelot Group accepted the fine and said it was sorry.

=== 2022 failings fine ===

<doc id="620815" wikidata="Q113672" url="?curid=620815" title="Lilia Skala">
<text>Lilia Skala (n√©e Sofer; 28 November 1896 ‚Äì 18 December 1994) was an Austrian and American architect and actress known for her role in the film &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot; (1963), for which she received critical acclaim and an Academy Award nomination. During her career, Skala was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award. 

Before Skala decided to be an actress, she practiced architecture as a profession. She was one of the first women architects in Austria and was the first female member of the Austrian Association of Engineers and Architects. She graduated from the University of Dresden Summa cum Laude; the institution is now known as the Technical University of Dresden, located in Germany. 

Her life was the subject of the eponymous one-woman play &quot;Lilia!&quot;, written and performed by her granddaughter Libby Skala.

==Early life and education==
Skala was born Lilia Sofer in Vienna. Her mother, Katharina Skala, was Roman Catholic, and her father, Julius Sofer, was Jewish and worked as a manufacturer&#x27;s representative for the Waldes Koh-i-noor Company. She was one of the first women to graduate in architecture and engineering from the University of Dresden, then practiced architecture professionally in Vienna.

In the late 1930s, she was forced to flee her Nazi-occupied homeland with her husband, Louis Erich Skala, and their two young sons. (Lilia and Erich adopted the non-Jewish sounding surname of Lilia&#x27;s mother.) Skala and her husband managed to escape (at different times) from Austria and eventually settled in the United States.

==Career==
According to a short memoir by Skala&#x27;s son Peter, Skala developed an interest in theatre when she was 14 or 15 years old. However, Skala&#x27;s parents were conservative and preferred Skala to pursue a career that was more &quot;respectable&quot;. At that time, women were not allowed to study at the University of Vienna, so Skala&#x27;s parents had to send her to the TU of Dresden in Germany. Although it is unclear why Skala choose to study architecture, she excelled in the field and graduated &quot;Summa cum Laude&quot;. Skala returned to Vienna and continued to practice architecture after the completion of her undergraduate degree. 

About a year after the birth of Skala&#x27;s son, she enrolled in acting lessons and renewed her interest in theatre. As her creative talents unfurled, Skala appeared in television shows and serials from 1952 to 1985, such as &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; in 1965. As Grand Duchess Sophie, Skala kept company on Broadway with Ethel Merman in &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;, not too many years after toiling in a Queens, New York zipper factory as a non-English-speaking refugee from Austria. She played Lisa Douglas‚Äôs mother, the Countess, on &quot;Green Acres&quot; in the 1960s.

She was nominated as Best Supporting Actress for her most famous role as the Mother Superior in 1963&#x27;s &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot;. Skala also appeared in &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; (1965), &quot;Charly&quot; (1968), &quot;Deadly Hero&quot; (1976), &quot;Eleanor and Franklin&quot; (1976), &quot;Roseland&quot; (1977), &quot;Heartland&quot; (1979) &quot;Flashdance&quot; (1983), and &quot;House of Games&quot; (1987).

== Death and legacy ==
Skala died in 1994 in Bay Shore, New York of natural causes at age 98. A collection of architectural drawings that she had made as an architecture student at the University of Dresden from 1915 to 1920 was donated to the International Archives of Women in Architecture by her sons, Peter and Martin Skala. The collection was part of Skala&#x27;s belongings when she fled the Nazis in 1939.

== Personal life ==
Skala was a Christian Scientist. She was introduced to the religion in Vienna in the 1920s.

<text>Leon Ames (born Harry Leon Wycoff; January 20, 1902 ‚Äì October 12, 1993) was an American film and television actor. He is best remembered for playing father figures in such films as &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944), &quot;Little Women&quot; (1949), &quot;On Moonlight Bay&quot; (1951) and &quot;By the Light of the Silvery Moon&quot; (1953). His best-known dramatic role may have been in the crime film &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; (1946).

==Early years==
Leon Ames was born Harry Leon Wycoff on January 20, 1902 in Portland, Indiana to Charles Elmer Wycoff and Cora Alice (DeMoss) Wycoff. Some sources list his original last name as Wykoff or Waycoff, and in his early films, he acted under the name of Leon Waycoff. In 1935, Ames explained that he had changed his name because Waycoff was often misspelled and mispronounced. Ames was his mother&#x27;s maiden name.

In the 1910 census, when his family was residing in Fowler, Indiana, Ames&#x27; name was given as Harry L. Wycoff and his father was listed as a manager of a meat market. During World War I, Ames served in the field artillery of the U.S. Army and later in the flying corps (the Army Air Service).

==Stage==
Ames&#x27; involvement with entertainment began when he worked as a stage manager for the Charles K. Champlin Theatre Company. He ventured into acting with the group and progressed to the lead in a production of &quot;Tomorrow and Tomorrow&quot; in Los Angeles. He acted for three years with the Stuart Walker Stock Company in Cincinnati.

He debuted on Broadway in &quot;It Pays to Sin&quot; (1933). His other Broadway credits include &quot;Howie&quot; (1958), &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot;, (1958), &quot;Slightly Married&quot; (1943), &quot;The Russian People&quot; (1942), &quot;Little Darling&quot; (1942), &quot;Guest in the House&quot; (1942), &quot;The Land Is Bright&quot; (1941), &quot;The Male Animal&quot; (1940), &quot;Thirsty Soil&quot; (1937), &quot;A House in the Country&quot; (1937) and &quot;Bright Honor&quot; (1936).

== Film ==

Ames made his film debut in &quot;Quick Millions&quot; in 1931. During the 1940s, he was under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Among his important roles at MGM was his portrayal of Mr. Smith in the studio&#x27;s 1944 hit film &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;.

Ames was also featured in &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; (1946), portraying the district attorney Kyle Sackett. He appeared in the Doris Day-Gordon MacRae film &quot;On Moonlight Bay&quot; (1951), its sequel &quot;By the Light of the Silvery Moon&quot; (1953) and &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (1957) and &quot;From the Terrace&quot; (1960).

In the 1961 Walt Disney comedy &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot;, Ames played college president Rufus Daggett. He reprised the role in the film&#x27;s 1963 sequel &quot;Son of Flubber&quot;. In 1970, he was cast as Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox in the action war film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; His last screen role occurred in &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; (1986), playing the grandfather of Kathleen Turner&#x27;s character.

== Radio and television ==
Ames&#x27; first radio broadcast was in January 1942 on &quot;Grand Central Station&quot;.

His television roles included leads in the adaptations of &quot;Life with Father&quot; (1953‚Äì55) and &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1961‚Äì62). His role in &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; was soon increased because he had become the series&#x27; dominant character.

Ames had the title role of judge John Cooper in the syndicated series &quot;Frontier Judge&quot; and played Howard McMann in &quot;Bewitched&quot;. He joined the cast of &quot;Mister Ed&quot; (1963‚Äì66) as a neighbor following the death of actor Larry Keating. Ames also appeared in episodes of the NBC anthology series &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot; and on the short-lived CBS legal drama &quot;Storefront Lawyers&quot;. He played a grandfather in the 1975 &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; episode ‚ÄúJenny‚Äôs Grandparents‚Äù.

Ames was a founder of the Screen Actors Guild in 1933, and he served as its president in 1957. During the 1960s, Ames owned several Ford dealerships in California.

==Personal life==
Ames was the father of Robert Fletcher, who was left with his mother when she and Ames split up in 1923.

Ames wed actress Christine Gossett in 1938. The couple had a daughter, Shelley (b. 1940), and a son, Leon (b. 1943). Christine retired early from acting to raise their family. They remained married until Ames&#x27; death in 1993.

Ames supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.

==Kidnapping==
On February 12, 1964, Ames and his wife were held hostage in their home as an intruder demanded $50,000 before he would free them. Ames called his business partner, who obtained the money from a bank and delivered it to the house as instructed. After inspecting the cash, the kidnapper left Ames in the house, bound with tape, and instructed Mrs. Ames to drive him in the couple&#x27;s car. He also forced both the business partner and a guest in the Ames house into the trunk. Eventually, police (who had been alerted by the partner while he was picking up the money) surrounded the car and freed the hostages.

== Death ==
On October 12, 1993, Ames died at the age of 91 in Laguna Beach, California of complications after suffering a stroke. His gravesite is at Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles.

== Recognition ==
In 1980, after 50 years in show business, Ames received the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award.

<text>Edward Lhuyd (1660‚Äì 30 June 1709), also known as Edward Lhwyd and by other spellings, was a Welsh naturalist, botanist, herbalist, alchemist, scientist, linguist, geographer and antiquary. He was the second Keeper of the University of Oxford&#x27;s Ashmolean Museum, and published the first catalogue of fossils, the .

==Name==
Lhuyd ( ; ) is an archaic spelling of the same Welsh surname now usually rendered as Lloyd or Llwyd, from (&quot;gray&quot;). It also appears frequently as Lhwyd; less often as Lhwydd, Llhwyd, Llwid and Floyd; and latinized as or , frequently abbreviated , and as and some scientific names. The English and Latin forms are also sometimes combined as &quot;Edward Luidius&quot;.

==Life==
Lhuyd was born in 1660, in Loppington, Shropshire, England, the illegitimate son of Edward Llwyd or Lloyd of Llanforda, Oswestry, and Bridget Pryse of Llansantffraid, near Talybont, Cardiganshire, in 1660. His family belonged to the gentry of southwest Wales. Though well established, the family was not wealthy. His father experimented with agriculture and industry in a manner that impinged on the new science of the day. The son attended and later taught at Oswestry Grammar School, and in 1682 went up to Jesus College, Oxford, but dropped out before graduation. In 1684, he was appointed to assist Robert Plot, Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum (which at that time was in Broad Street), and became the second Keeper himself in 1690, holding the post until his death in 1709.

While working at the Ashmolean Museum, Lhuyd travelled extensively. A visit to Snowdonia in 1688 allowed him to compile for John Ray&#x27;s a list of flora local to that region. After 1697, Lhuyd visited every county in Wales, then travelled to Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall, Brittany and the Isle of Man. In 1699, it became possible through funding from his friend Isaac Newton for him to publish the first catalogue ever of fossils, his . These had been collected in England, mostly in Oxford, and are now held in the Ashmolean.

Lhuyd received a MA &quot;honoris causa&quot; from the University of Oxford in 1701 and a fellowship of the Royal Society in 1708.

In 1696, Lluyd transcribed much of the Latin inscription on the 9th-century Pillar of Eliseg near Valle Crucis Abbey, Denbighshire. The inscription subsequently became almost illegible due to weathering, but Lhuyd&#x27;s transcript seems to have been remarkably accurate.

Lhuyd was also responsible for the first scientific description and naming of what we would now recognize as a dinosaur: the sauropod tooth &quot;Rutellum impicatum&quot;.
The first written record of a trilobite was by Lhuyd in a letter to Martin Lister in 1688 and published (1869) in his &quot;Lithophylacii Britannici Ichnographia&quot;. It is a fleeting mention and he simply identifies his find as a &quot;skeleton of some flat fish&quot;. The trilobite is nowadays identified as &quot;Ogygiocarella debuchii&quot; Brongniart, 1822.

==Pioneering linguist==
In the late 17th century, Lhuyd was contacted by a group of scholars led by John Keigwin of Mousehole, who sought to preserve and further the Cornish language. He accepted their invitation to travel there and study the language. Early Modern Cornish was the subject of a paper published by Lhuyd in 1702; it differs from the medieval language in having a considerably simpler structure and grammar.

In 1707, having been assisted in his research by a fellow Welsh scholar, Moses Williams, Lhuyd published the first volume of &quot;Arch√¶ologia Britannica&quot;. This has an important linguistic description of Cornish, which is noted all the more for the understanding of historical linguistics it shows. Some of the ideas commonly attributed to linguists of the 19th century have their roots in this work by Lhuyd, who was &quot;considerably more sophisticated in his methods and perceptions than [William] Jones&quot;.

Lhuyd noted a similarity between two language families: Brythonic or P‚ÄìCeltic (Breton, Cornish and Welsh) and Goidelic or Q‚ÄìCeltic (Irish, Manx and Scottish Gaelic). He argued that both families were derived from the Continental Celtic languages; the Brythonic languages originated in the Gaulish language once spoken and written by the Gauls of Pre-Roman France and the Goidelic languages are derived from the Celtiberian language once spoken in the Pre-Roman Iberian Peninsula, which includes modern Spain and Portugal. He concluded that as these languages were of Celtic origin, those who spoke them were Celts. From the 18th century, peoples of Brittany, Cornwall, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Scotland and Wales were known increasingly as Celts. They are seen to this day as modern Celtic nations.

==Death and legacy==
On his travels, Lhuyd developed asthma, which eventually led to his death from pleurisy in Oxford in 1709. He died in his room in the Ashmolean Museum, aged just 49, and was buried in the Welsh aisle of the church of St Michael at the Northgate.

The Cretaceous bryozoan species (originally described as &quot;Membranipora lhuydi&quot;) is named in his honour. The Snowdon lily (&quot;Gagea serotina&quot;) was for a time called &quot;Lloydia serotina&quot; after Lhuyd. 

Cymdeithas Edward Llwyd, the National Naturalists&#x27; Society of Wales, is named after him. On 9 June 2001 a bronze bust of him was unveiled by Dafydd Wigley, a former Plaid Cymru leader, outside the University of Wales Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies in Aberystwyth, next to the National Library of Wales. The sculptor was John Meirion Morris; the inscription on the plinth, carved by Ieuan Rees, reads &quot;&quot; (&quot;linguist, antiquary, naturalist&quot;).

<text>Lynne Littman (born June 26, 1941) is an American film and television director and producer.

She is best known for directing &quot;Testament.&quot; She has won several awards including an Academy Award for documentary short film &quot;Number Our Days&quot; (1976).

Littman was one of the Original Six, a group of women directors who created the Women&#x27;s Steering Committee of the Directors Guild of America to protest against gender discrimination in Hollywood.

== Early life and education ==
Littman was born June 26, 1941, in New York City. She attended Music &amp; Art High School and Sarah Lawrence College, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1962. She also studied at the Sorbonne from 1960 to 1961.

== Career ==
Littman began her career in the industry by working as a secretary for WNET (New York). In the following years she worked at a number of freelance jobs in different areas of film. It was until the 1970s when she began working for National Education Television. It is here that she began to explore her future in film journalism.

Commonly she worked with Mort Silverstein, who was known for having a passion for hard-hitting news practices. They made a follow-up documentary to Edward R. Murrow&#x27;s &quot;Harvest of Shame&quot;, titled &quot;What Harvest for the Reaper&quot;. She made several award-winning documentary shorts, including &quot;The Matter of Kenneth&quot; (1973). Her most notable short documentary film was &quot;Number Our Days&quot; (1976), based on the field work of anthropologist Barbara Myerhoff; this film received an Academy Award in 1977.

Littman&#x27;s first feature film was &quot;Testament&quot; (1983), about a family struggling to survive after a nuclear fallout. The film is based on a short story titled &quot;The Last Testament&quot; by Carol Amen. Littman had been reading the story with her son when she had the idea to adapt it. Many had wanted to obtain the film; however, Littman had managed to secure the rights first. She immediately went about trying to find money for the film. Eventually, a producer at PBS&#x27; American Playhouse gave her $500,000 for a 60-minute movie that would involve no studio interference. However, the budget had to be expanded to $750,000 when the screenwriter turned in a script for a 90-minute film that was well received by all involved. Littman stated how proud she was that the film was completed under budget, yet the editing process had taken five months longer than the standard television film. The film was a success upon release and garnered an Academy Award nomination for its lead actress Jane Alexander.

Following &quot;Testament&quot;, Littman made films infrequently. In 1999, she made two films: &quot;Freak City&quot;, and &quot;Having Our Say&quot;, which were aired on television on the same day and in the same time-slot.

Littman has won four Los Angeles Emmy Awards, from 1972 to 1974, and in 1977. She has received nominations for four Cine Golden Eagles for &quot;Running My Way&quot; (1982) and &quot;In Her Own Time&quot; (1985).

== Personal life ==
Littman was married to Taylor Hackford from 1977 to 1987. She has one child, Alexander Hackford, as well as a stepson, Rio Hackford. In 1985 she took a ten-year hiatus from film making to raise her child. During the 1980s and 1990s Littman served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute.

==Archive==
Littman&#x27;s moving image collection is held at the Academy Film Archive. The archive preserved her film &quot;Number Our Days&quot; in 2007.

<doc id="620833" wikidata="Q7777099" url="?curid=620833" title="The point (ice hockey)">
<text>The point is a term in ice hockey to indicate a position inside the opposition&#x27;s blue line along the edges of the rink.

==Description==
A player in the opponent&#x27;s end zone at the junction of the blue line with the boards is said to be at the point. Usually the players at the two points are the defencemen. On the power play the players playing at these positions are always known as the points, though one of the positions is sometimes played by a forward.

The point&#x27;s responsibilities include attempting to keep the puck in the offensive zone when the defensive team attempts to clear (see also Offside (ice hockey)), receiving a pass from the forwards to allow the play to reset, and taking slapshots at the goal, hoping to score, create a rebound or a deflection. On the power play, one of the players playing the point is typically the &quot;quarterback&quot; - that is, the one who controls (through passing) where the puck goes, and also takes many shots.

Given the difficulty of scoring directly from the point due to the distance to the goal, goals scored from the point are typically either on screens, or are tipped goals.

==Point and cover point==

In the early years of ice hockey, the two defencemen were known as the &quot;point&quot; and &quot;cover-point&quot; players. The term &quot;the point&quot; may have been derived from that early terminology. The point played further back, while the cover-point was allowed more latitude to roam forward.

<text>Robert Coppola Schwartzman (born December 24, 1982), also known as Robert Carmine, is an American director, screenwriter, actor, and musician. He is best known as the lead vocalist of the rock/pop band Rooney. Schwartzman directed the films &quot;Dreamland&quot; (2016), &quot;The Unicorn&quot; (2018), and &quot;The Argument&quot; (2020), acted in his cousin Sofia Coppola&#x27;s projects &quot;Lick the Star&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (1999), and starred in &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; (2001).

==Early life==
Schwartzman was born in Los Angeles, California, to Talia Shire (n√©e Coppola) and film producer Jack Schwartzman. His paternal grandparents were Ashkenazi Jews, while his mother is an Italian-American Catholic. His older brother, Jason Schwartzman, is also an actor and musician. His paternal half-siblings are Stephanie and cinematographer John Schwartzman, while his maternal half-brother is Matthew Shire.

As a member of the Coppola family, many of his relatives are also involved in the entertainment industry‚Äîhe is the nephew of filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola and opera conductor Anton Coppola; the cousin of actor Nicolas Cage and filmmakers Sofia Coppola, Roman Coppola, and Christopher Coppola; and the grandson of Coppola family matriarch Italia Coppola (n√©e Pennino) and composer Carmine Coppola.

==Career==
Schwartzman attended Windward School in Los Angeles and formed his band Rooney in 1999, in his junior year of school. He left the band temporarily when he attended Eugene Lang College in New York City in 2001. In his first semester at college, Schwartzman wrote songs in his dorm room and flew home every month to perform new material for Rooney. Most of the songs on the first Rooney album were written while he was at college, and it was during this time that he realized that he wanted to go back to Los Angeles and pursue a professional career in music with Rooney.

In early 2002, shortly after Schwartzman left school, Rooney was signed to Geffen/Interscope Records. Rooney recorded their self-titled debut album in June 2002. They also were selected by his friend Johnny Ramone for the Ramones tribute album &quot;We&#x27;re a Happy Family&quot;, which was released in early 2003. Rooney opened for Weezer during their headlining tour in the summer of 2002; it was their first national support slot. The next tour the band landed was with The Strokes. &quot;Rooney&quot; was finally released in May 2003, and has since sold approximately 500,000 copies. The band had a cameo appearance in an episode of &quot;The O.C.&quot;, &quot;The Third Wheel&quot;. Their song &quot;Blueside&quot; was featured on the &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004&quot; soundtrack, and their song &quot;I&#x27;m Shakin&#x27;&quot; was featured on an episode of the daytime soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;.

On November 16, 2004, the band issued their first DVD, &quot;Spit and Sweat&quot;. The hour-long documentary features interviews with the band and live performances from Los Angeles. The DVD also includes the videos for &quot;Blueside&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Shakin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;If It Were Up to Me&quot;, and &quot;Popstars&quot;, which was released as a never-before-seen video. Following their 2006 summer tour, the band began the recording sessions for their second album. Three songs from previous sessions (&quot;Don&#x27;t Come Around Again&quot;, &quot;Paralyzed&quot;, and &quot;Tell Me Soon&quot;), were kept for their new album, &quot;Calling the World&quot;. On March 6, 2007, the single &quot;When Did Your Heart Go Missing?&quot; was released on their MySpace account, and was also used in commercials for the TV show &quot;Beauty and the Geek&quot;. The album was released to stores July 17, 2007, and debuted at #42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 Albums chart.

Schwartzman released his first solo album, &quot;Double Capricorn&quot;, on October 25, 2011. All profits from the sale of the album will be donated to the Tibetan Healing Fund, to help build a new birthing center. He scored the 2013 film &quot;Palo Alto&quot; with Dev Hynes of Blood Orange.

In 2016, Schwartzman wrote and directed &quot;Dreamland&quot;, starring Johnny Simmons and Amy Landecker. It had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 14, 2016. It was released in a limited release and through video on demand on November 11, 2016. In 2018, he directed &quot;The Unicorn&quot;, starring Lauren Lapkus and Nick Rutherford. It had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 10, 2018.

=== Utopia Media ===
In 2018, Schwartzman co-founded Utopia Media, a &quot;filmmaker first&quot; distribution company. In 2020, Utopia Media announced the launch of Altavod, a platform for filmmakers to more easily distribute and profit from their films. Altavod originally launched in partnership with Unanimous Media‚Äôs documentary &quot;Jump Shot&quot;, a documentary that uncovered the inspiring true story of the forgotten basketball legend who developed, pioneered, and popularized the modern-day jump shot. Stephen Curry served as an executive producer on the film, which was distributed by Aspiration Media.

In 2020, Utopia Media released a 4K restoration of the 1980s cult-classic &quot;Rad&quot; by director Hal Needham. It starred Schwartzman&#x27;s mother, Talia Shire, and was executive produced by his father, Jack Schwartzman. The film made its belated Blu-ray and 4K Ultra HD debut in May 2020, from Vinegar Syndrome and Utopia Distribution.

<doc id="620841" wikidata="Q1562569" url="?curid=620841" title="Buck Ewing">
<text>William &quot;Buck&quot; Ewing (October 17, 1859 ‚Äì October 20, 1906) was an American Major League Baseball player and manager. He was renowned for both his offensive and defensive skills during his playing career. In 1939, Ewing was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, becoming the first catcher to receive the honor.

==Career==
Born in Hoagland, Ohio, in 1859, Ewing joined the National League in 1880 as a member of the Troy Trojans, but rose to stardom in 1883 as a member of the New York Gothams, later known as the Giants. That year he hit 10 home runs (a feat he would never repeat), while batting .303. Playing in an era when triples were more common than home runs due to the spacious parks and poor quality of the balls used, he led the league in 1884 with 20 triples, and was often among the league leaders.
Ewing was equally renowned for his defensive abilities. Writing in the 1938 Spalding Guide, John Foster said of him, &quot;As a thrower to bases Ewing never had a superior, and there are not to exceed ten men who could come anywhere near being equal to him. Ewing was the man of whom it was said, &quot;He handed the ball to the second baseman from the batter&#x27;s box.&quot; Primarily a catcher, Ewing was versatile enough to play all nine positions and fast enough to steal 354 bases. He hit .300 in ten different seasons.

Playing until 1897 with the Giants, Cleveland Spiders and Cincinnati Reds, Ewing posted consistently superb offensive numbers. Arguably his best season was in 1893 with the Spiders when he batted .344 with 6 home runs, 117 runs, 122 RBI, and 47 stolen bases.

In 1890, when a player revolt led to the formation of the short-lived Players&#x27; League, Ewing led the New York franchise as both star player and manager. Lingering resentment in the wake of the league&#x27;s establishment and demise has been suspected as a reason for his limited play in 1891 and subsequent move to Cleveland following the 1892 season. Ewing finished his career with a .303 lifetime batting average, 1129 runs, 883 RBI, 250 doubles, 178 triples, and 71 home runs ‚Äì totals made more impressive by the fact he was playing annual seasons only 100-130 games long.

In addition to playing, Ewing managed for seven seasons: the 1890 (Players&#x27; League) Giants, the 1895‚Äì1899 Cincinnati Reds, and the first half of the season with the 1900 Giants. He compiled a 489-395 record for a .553 winning percentage. Ewing also was used as an American Association umpire for two games on June 28 and July 4, .

Ewing died of diabetes in Cincinnati in 1906.

==Legacy==
In the first elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame, Ewing and Cap Anson led all 19th century players. Three years later, in 1939, they were among the first 19th century players elected and Ewing became the first member who was primarily a catcher. He was named one of the top five players from the 19th century in a 1999 poll by the Society for American Baseball Research.

In the 1947 film &quot;Life with Father&quot;, set in the late 1800s, Clarence Day&#x27;s son Clarence, Jr. announces to everyone that the morning paper noted Buck Ewing had hit a home run for the Giants the day before.

<text>The Treaty of Blois can refer to one of the four treaties signed in the French city of Blois, in the early sixteenth century, between the Spanish kingdoms and France:
* Treaty of Blois (1504) (1st Treaty of Blois), of September 22, 1504, Louis XII of France and Maximilian I of Habsburg agree that the dowry of Louis XII&#x27;s daughter, Claude, in marriage to Maximilian&#x27;s grandson, the future emperor Charles V, would include Milan and Burgundy. In return, Maximilian agrees to recognize Louis XII as the duke of Milan. The union never happens. 
* Treaty of Blois (1505) (2nd treaty of Blois), of October 12, 1505, Louis XII of France renounces his claim to Naples, leaving the kingdom in control of Ferdinand of Aragon. 
* Treaty of Blois (1509) (3rd Treaty of Blois), of December 12, 1509, an alliance between Ferdinand II of Aragon (and now regent of Castile), Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, and King Louis XII of France in the War of the League of Cambrai in northern Italy.
* Treaty of Blois (1512) (4th Treaty of Blois), of July 18, 1512, a defensive pact between Navarre and France to respect Navarre&#x27;s neutrality, whereby Francis I of France also recognizes the sovereignty of the Principality of B√©arn.

It can also refer to two unrelated treaties:
* Treaty of Blois (1499), an alliance between France and Venice against the Duchy of Milan.
* Treaty of Blois (1572), an agreement to have free trade and a military alliance between England and France against Spain in the Spanish Netherlands.

<text>Quettehou ( or ) is a commune in the Manche department in north-western France. On 1 January 2019, the former commune Morsalines was merged into Quettehou.

==Geography==
The town of Quettehou is located at the North-East tip of the peninsula of Cotentin in an area called Val de Saire, the vale of the river Saire.

==History==
The creation of Quettehou dates back to the Viking invasions when Ketil, chief of a Viking tribe, decided to settle at the top of the hill dominating the bay of Morsalines. With time, Ketil&#x27;s hill (Ketil holm) became known as Quettehou.

The Black Prince was knighted in the local church by his father, King Edward III of England, on 12 July 1346, prior to the Battle of Cr√©cy.

<doc id="620845" wikidata="Q1899451" url="?curid=620845" title="Lord Chamberlain's Men">
<text>The Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men was a company of actors, or a &quot;playing company&quot; (as it then would likely have been described), for which William Shakespeare wrote during most of his career. Richard Burbage played most of the lead roles, including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth. Formed at the end of a period of flux in the theatrical world of London, it had become, by 1603, one of the two leading companies of the city and was subsequently patronized by James I.

It was founded during the reign of Elizabeth I of England in 1594 under the patronage of Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon, then the Lord Chamberlain, who was in charge of court entertainments. After Carey&#x27;s death on 23 July 1596, the company came under the patronage of his son, George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, for whom it was briefly known as Lord Hunsdon&#x27;s Men. When George Carey in turn became Lord Chamberlain on 17 March 1597, it reverted to its previous name. The company became the King&#x27;s Men in 1603 when King James ascended the throne and became the company&#x27;s patron. The company held exclusive rights to perform Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

==Playhouses==
From 1594 the players performed at The Theatre, in Shoreditch. Problems with the landlord caused the company to move to the nearby Curtain Theatre in 1597. On the night of 29 December 1598, The Theatre was dismantled by the Burbage brothers, along with William Smith, their financial backer, Peter Street, a carpenter, and ten to twelve workmen. The beams were then carried south of the river to Southwark to form part of their new playhouse, the Globe Theatre. Built in 1599, this theatre was destroyed in a fire on 29 June 1613. The Globe was rebuilt by June 1614 and finally closed in 1642. The company also toured Britain, and visited France and Belgium.

A modern reconstruction of the original Globe, named &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe&quot;, was opened in 1997 near the site of the original theatre.

==Personnel==

The initial form of the Chamberlain&#x27;s men arose largely from the departure of Edward Alleyn from Lord Strange&#x27;s Men and the subsequent death of Lord Strange himself, in the spring of 1594. Yet the ultimate success of the company was largely determined by the Burbage family. James Burbage was the impresario who assembled the company and directed its activities until his death in 1597; his sons Richard and Cuthbert were members of the company, though Cuthbert did not act. This connection with the Burbages makes the Chamberlain&#x27;s Men the central link in a chain that extends from the beginning of professional theatre (in 1574, James Burbage led the first group of actors to be protected under the 1572 statute against rogues and vagabonds) in Renaissance London to its end (in 1642, the King&#x27;s Men were among the acting companies whose activities were ended by Parliament&#x27;s prohibition of the stage.)

The Chamberlain&#x27;s Men comprised a core of eight &quot;sharers&quot;, who split profits and debts; perhaps an equal number of hired men who acted minor and doubled parts; and a slightly smaller number of boy players, who were sometimes bound apprentices to an adult actor. The original sharers in the Chamberlain&#x27;s were eight. Probably the most famous in the 1590s to the 1600s was William Kempe, who had been in the company of the Earl of Leicester in the 1580s, and had later joined the King&#x27;s Men. As the company&#x27;s clown, he presumably took the broadest comic role in every play; he is identified with Peter in the quarto of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and probably also originated Dog-berry in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and Bottom in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Kempe has traditionally been viewed as the object of Hamlet&#x27;s complaint about extemporising clowns; whether this association is right or wrong, Kempe had left the company by 1601. Another two sharers from Strange&#x27;s Men had a long-standing association with Kempe. George Bryan had been in Leicester&#x27;s Men in the 1580s, and at Elsinore with Kempe in 1586; because he is not mentioned in later Chamberlain&#x27;s or King&#x27;s Men documents, it is assumed that Bryan retired from the stage in 1597 or 1598. (Bryan lived on for some years; in the reign of James, he is listed as a Groom of the Chamber, with household duties, as late as 1613.) Thomas Pope, another Leicester&#x27;s veteran, retired in 1600 and died in 1603. Both Bryan and Pope came to the company from Lord Strange&#x27;s Men.
Augustine Phillips also came from Strange&#x27;s Men. He remained with the troupe until his death in 1605.

Two younger actors who came from Strange&#x27;s, Henry Condell and John Heminges, are most famous now for collecting and editing the plays of Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folio (1623). Both were relatively young in 1594, and both remained with the company until after the death of King James; their presence provided an element of continuity across decades of changing taste and commercial uncertainty.

(Some scholars have theorised that the company maintained its original eight-sharer structure, and that as any man left, through retirement or death, his place as sharer was filled by someone else. So, Bryan was replaced by William Sly, ca. 1597; Kempe was replaced by Robert Armin, ca. 1599; Pope was replaced by Condell, ca. 1600. But this scheme, while possible, is not proven by the available evidence.)

The two sharers who would contribute the most to the Chamberlain&#x27;s Men did not come from Strange&#x27;s Men. Shakespeare&#x27;s activities before 1594 have been a matter of considerable inquiry; he may have been with Pembroke&#x27;s Men and Derby&#x27;s Men in the early 1590s. As a sharer, he was at first equally important as actor and playwright. At an uncertain but probably early date, his writing became more important, although he continued to act at least until 1603, when he performed in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Sejanus&quot;.

No less important was Richard Burbage. He was the lead actor of the Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, who played Hamlet and Othello, and would go on to play King Lear and Macbeth in the new reign of King James, among many other roles. Though relatively little-known in 1594, he would become one of the most famous of Renaissance actors, achieving a fame and wealth exceeded only by Alleyn&#x27;s.

Among the hired men were some who eventually became sharers. William Sly, who performed occasionally with the Admiral&#x27;s Men during the 1590s, acted for the Chamberlain&#x27;s by 1598, and perhaps before; he became a sharer after Phillips&#x27;s death in 1605. Richard Cowley, identified as Verges by the quarto of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, became a sharer in the King&#x27;s Men. Nicholas Tooley, at one point apprenticed to Burbage, stayed with the company until his death in 1623. John Sincler (or Sincklo) may have specialised in playing thin characters; he seems to have remained a hired man. John Duke was a hired man who went to Worcester&#x27;s Men early in James&#x27;s reign.

At least two of the boys had distinguished careers. Alexander Cooke is associated with a number of Shakespeare&#x27;s female characters, while Christopher Beeston went on to become a wealthy impresario in the seventeenth century.

===Later sharers===
The core members of the company changed in both major and minor ways before James&#x27;s accession. The most famous change is that of Will Kemp, the circumstances of which remain unclear. Kempe was among the stakeholders in the Globe property, and he may have performed in that theatre in its first year. His famous morris dance to Norwich took place during Lent, when the company lay idle; not until the hastily added epilogue to &quot;Nine Days&#x27; Wonder&quot; (his account of the stunt) does he refer to his plan to return to individual performances. He may have had a hand in the bad quartos of &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;The London Prodigal&quot;, in which the clown parts are unusually accurate.

Whatever the reason for his departure, Kempe was replaced by Robert Armin, formerly of Chandos&#x27;s Men and an author in his own right. Small and fanciful, Armin offered significantly different options for Shakespeare, and the change is seen in the last Elizabethan and first Jacobean plays. Armin is generally credited with originating such characters as Feste in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, Touchstone in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, and the fool in &quot;King Lear&quot;.

Thus, by 1603 the core of the troupe was in some respects younger than it had been in 1594. Bryan, Pope, and Kempe, veterans of the 1580s, had left, and the remaining sharers (with the probable exception of Phillips), were roughly within a decade of 40.

==Repertory and performances==
Shakespeare&#x27;s work undoubtedly formed the great bulk of the company&#x27;s repertory. In their first year of performance, they may have staged such of Shakespeare&#x27;s older plays as remained in the author&#x27;s possession, including &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot;, &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;, as well as &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;. &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; may have been the first play Shakespeare wrote for the new company; it was followed over the next two years by a concentrated burst of creativity that resulted in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Love&#x27;s Labours Lost&quot;, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, and the plays in the so-called second tetralogy. The extent and nature of the non-Shakespearean repertory in the first is not known; plays such as &quot;Locrine&quot;, &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John&quot;, and Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Edward II&quot; have somewhat cautiously been advanced as likely candidates. The earliest non-Shakespearean play known to have been performed by the company is Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;, which was produced in the middle of 1598; they also staged the thematic sequel, &quot;Every Man Out of His Humour&quot;, the next year.

On the strength of these plays, the company quickly rivalled Alleyn&#x27;s troupe for preeminence in London; as early as 1595 they gave four performances at court, followed by six the next year and four in 1597. These years were, typically for an Elizabethan company, also fraught with uncertainty. The company suffered along with the others in the summer of 1597, when the uproar over &quot;The Isle of Dogs&quot; temporarily closed the theatres; records from Dover and Bristol indicate that at least some of the company toured that summer. The character of Falstaff, though immensely popular from the start, aroused the ire of Lord Cobham, who objected to the use of the character&#x27;s original name (Oldcastle), which derived from a member of Cobham&#x27;s family.

In the last years of the century, the company continued to stage Shakespeare&#x27;s new plays, including &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot;, which may have opened the Globe, and &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which may well have appeared first at the Curtain. Among non-Shakespearean drama, &quot;A Warning for Fair Women&quot; was certainly performed, as was the Tudor history &quot;Thomas Lord Cromwell&quot;, sometimes seen as a salvo in a theatrical feud with the Admiral&#x27;s Men, whose lost plays on Wolsey date from the same year.

In 1601, in addition to their tangential involvement with the Essex rebellion, the company played a role in a less serious conflict, the so-called War of the Theatres. They produced Thomas Dekker&#x27;s &quot;Satiromastix&quot;, a satire on Ben Jonson that seems to have ended the dispute. Somewhat uncharacteristically, Jonson does not appear to have held a grudge against the company; in 1603, they staged his &quot;Sejanus&quot;, with dissatisfying results. They also performed &quot;The London Prodigal&quot;, &quot;The Merry Devil of Edmonton&quot;, and &quot;The Fair Maid of Bristow&quot;, the last a rarity in that it is a Chamberlain&#x27;s play that has never been attributed in any part to Shakespeare.

==Controversies==

The Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, and its individual members, largely avoided the scandals and turbulence in which other companies and actors sometimes involved themselves. Their most serious difficulty with the government came about as a result of their tangential involvement in the February 1601 insurrection of the Earl of Essex. Some of Essex&#x27;s supporters had commissioned a special performance of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; in the hope that the spectacle of that king&#x27;s overthrow might make the public more amenable to the overthrow of Elizabeth (who later remarked, &quot;I am Richard II, know ye not that?&quot;). Augustine Phillips was deposed on the matter by the investigating authorities; he testified that the actors had been offered 40 shillings more than their usual fee, and for that reason alone had performed the play on 7 February, the day before Essex&#x27;s uprising. The explanation was accepted; the company and its members went unpunished, and even performed for Elizabeth at Whitehall on 24 February, the day before Essex&#x27;s execution.

The following year, 1602, saw Christopher Beeston&#x27;s rape charge. Probably some of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men were among the actors who accompanied Beeston to his pretrial hearing at Bridewell and caused a disturbance there; but little can be said for certain.

==Audience==
Theatre-going became an extremely popular activity for many in London in the late 16th and early 17th century because of the constant advertisement seen throughout London playbills. During these years London had a population of approximately 200,000. Within that group of 200,000 over 15,000 men and women attended plays on a weekly basis. The Londoners who attended the theatre also enjoyed cock-fighting, bull-baiting, and bear-baiting. The theatres were in a rough part of London and were surrounded by the vices of drinking, gambling, and prostitution.

As Lord Chamberlain‚Äôs Men popularity grew, they began to attract more and more theatre goers and became one of the most popular playing companies. But as their popularity grew so did the demand. The audience‚Äôs lives were ever changing which led to Lord Chamberlain‚Äôs Men having to cater to their audience resulting in the group having to perform six different plays every week. This was extremely strenuous on the actors as they had to memorize lines from many different plays and were given very little time if any for rehearsal.

As Lord Chamberlain‚Äôs Men continued to prosper, they began to perform at larger venues. In 1599 they began playing at the outdoor Globe Theatre that had a capacity of 3,000 people and in 1609 they began performing at the indoor Blackfriars Theatre that had a capacity limit of 600. The minimum entry price at the Blackfriars was sixpence, six times that of the Globe, with better seats charged at eighteen and thirty pence. This allowed the company to make money year-round from being able to have productions at indoor and outdoor theatres.

<text>The Opel Omega is an executive car engineered and manufactured by German automaker Opel between 1986 and 2003. The first generation, the Omega A (1986‚Äì1994), superseded the Opel Rekord. It was voted European Car of the Year for 1987, and was available as a saloon or estate. The second generation, the Omega B, was manufactured from 1994 to 2003.

Rebadged variants of the Omega were marketed worldwide, including in North America as the Cadillac Catera, in Great Britain as the Vauxhall Omega, and South America as the Chevrolet Omega. As with the Rekord which preceded it, re-engineered versions of the Omega were manufactured in Australia from 1988 as the Holden Commodore (and its derivatives) since 1999. Commodore-based cars were in turn exported to South America as the Chevrolet Omega and to the Middle East as the Chevrolet Lumina.

Production of the Omega was discontinued in 2003. It was succeeded by the Opel Signum.

==Omega A (1986‚Äì1994)==
===Development===
The original Omega went into production in September 1986, as a replacement for the final version of the Opel Rekord, which had been in production since 1978. Sales began in November. The body was designed as an evolution of the previous Opel design theme engineered more towards aerodynamics in view of higher fuel prices and the general drive towards more fuel efficiency. The result was a remarkable drag coefficient of 0.28 (0.32 for the Caravan). The whole development program cost 2.5 billion Deutschmarks or ¬£1.5 billion. The UK market version of the final generation of Rekord had been marketed as the Vauxhall Carlton, and this nameplate was retained for the new car.

Late in 1986, it was voted European Car of the Year for 1987, ahead of the highly acclaimed new versions of the Audi 80 and BMW 7 Series. Compared to the Rekord, the Omega featured many modern technological advances, which were new to Opel in general, if not to the volume segment European automotive market. These included electronic engine management, ABS, on-board computer (which displayed parameters such as momentary fuel consumption or average speed), air-conditioned glove compartment, and even the then fashionable LCD instrument cluster (available in CD version from 1987, but dropped in 1991). More importantly, the Omega came with a self-diagnosis system (which is now a standard feature in present-day cars), whose output could be read by appropriately equipped, authorised service stations. The Omega was one of the first cars to offer (individual) heated seats in the rear.

===Markets===
The Omega was sold in most European countries, albeit with &quot;Vauxhall Carlton&quot; badging in the United Kingdom. In Japan, the Omega A (and Vectra) were the first Opels to be distributed by Isuzu Motors Ltd. rather than by long-standing importer Toho Motors (Êù±ÈÇ¶„É¢„Éº„Çø„Éº„Ç∫), beginning in July 1989. In the Isuzu lineup, it was slotted above the Isuzu Aska.

===Engines===
All the Omega models used a longitudinally mounted engine with a rear-wheel drive setup, with a five-speed manual transmission or four-speed automatic transmission. The engine range consisted of 1.8¬†L, 2.0¬†L, and 2.4¬†L four-cylinder units (as well as 2.0¬†L, 2.3¬†L diesel, and 2.3¬†L turbodiesel) to 2.6¬†L, 3.0¬†L, and 3.0¬†L-24v six-cylinder units. The 1.8 L and 2.0 L four-cylinder petrol engines were all based on the Family II design, whilst the six-cylinder units and the 2.4 L four-cylinder were based on the older Opel cam-in-head engine family.

In Brazil, the car was sold as the Chevrolet Omega and powered by 2.0¬†L I4 (C20NE and C20YE) or 3.0¬†L I6 (C30NE) Opel engines until 1994. Since the discontinuation of the Omega A in Germany, General Motors do Brasil needed new engines to continue production and the 2.0¬†L I4 was replaced by 2.2¬†L I4 engine (C22NE) with and . The 3.0¬†L I6 was replaced by the locally produced 4.1¬†L (250ci) Chevrolet Straight-6 engine (C41GE) with and . As fitted to the Omega, this engine was tuned by Lotus and equipped with multi port fuel injection. The Chevrolet Omega was produced until 1998.

===Notable trim levels and special variants===
The four basic trim levels were LS, GL, GLS, and CD (from least to most expensive). The base LS was clearly intended for the fleet market, with the sedan unavailable to individual customers in some markets. The LS Caravan was also available as a panel van with rear side windows covered, with body-coloured foil rather than replaced by solid panels.

For the 1991 model year, the Omega A was afforded a facelift, which encompassed slight alterations to front and rear fascias, as well as interior materials and additional sound dampening. The until then base 1.8¬†L engine was dropped. The LS and GLS trim levels were also dropped, while the CD was joined by Club and CD Diamant.

====Omega Diamant====
This options package was introduced in 1988, and could be added onto the GLS, LS, and CD trim versions. It included alloy wheels, metallic paint, tinted windows, stereo with cassette player, various leather trim in the interior, and a painted grille and door mirrors. It sold well and the package was kept after the facelift and a similar system with the same name was used for the Omega B.

====Omega 3000====

The Omega 3000 was the sports version of the Omega A model range. It featured a straight-six, 3.0 litre, 12-valve engine, which produced . Other modifications from the base model included a lowered suspension and limited-slip differential, as well as different fascias and a rear spoiler. The car had a top speed of , and accelerated from 0‚Äì100¬†km/h in 8.8 seconds. The catalyzed version of the engine originally only had . The uncatalyzed model was discontinued in August 1988. In countries where the Omega 3000 was sold as a Vauxhall, it was called the Carlton GSi 3000.

In October 1989, the Omega 3000 received an optional new engine with 24 valves, two overhead camshafts, and a variable intake manifold (Opel &quot;Dual Ram&quot; system). It also used a more advanced engine control unit. Power increased to , which increased top speed to , and 0‚Äì100¬†km/h time dropped to 7.6 seconds. At the same time, output of the catalyzed two-valve version increased to , the same as the uncatalyzed original.

====Omega Evolution 500====

This was a limited series model produced together with Irmscher. 500 examples were built so that Opel could compete in the DTM. The car had a three-litre straight-six engine producing . The car accelerated from 0‚Äì100¬†km/h in 7.5 seconds and had a top speed of . The racing version used on the track had , accelerated to in about 5 seconds, and could reach nearly . It did not, however, achieve great success.

====Lotus Omega====


In 1989, Opel sanctioned a high-performance version of the Omega built in cooperation with Lotus. This version was named the Lotus Omega or Lotus Carlton depending on whether the base car was sold as an Opel Omega or Vauxhall Carlton in their respective European markets. The car was built using a variety of parts from other GM suppliers and manufacturers. The engine was based on Opel&#x27;s standard 3.0-litre, 24-valve, which was handed to Lotus to modify.

As a result, engine capacity rose to 3.6 litres; in addition, two Garrett T25 turbochargers were installed along with a water-cooled intercooler. The engine management was also modified, and the ignition changed to an AC Delco type (same system as the Lotus Esprit uses). The result was a high-performance engine.

This Omega also inherited a larger differential from Holden&#x27;s Commodore with a 45% LSD, whereas the gearbox was a six-speed manual ZF gearbox fitted to the Corvette ZR1. The tyres were custom made by Goodyear, and can be recognised by the small Greek letter Œ© (Omega) on the side. These were required, as this car could reach , which made this Omega the world&#x27;s fastest production sedan at the time.

This was a controversial fact given that the other major German manufacturers producing high-performance cars had been fitting speed limiters to not allow maximum speeds higher than . The car accelerated from 0‚Äì in 5.3 seconds and 0‚Äì in 11.5 seconds.


==Omega B (1994‚Äì2003)==
The 1994 Omega B was an all new car with a modern exterior design, but a traditional rear-wheel drive chassis. The engine range was all new. Its MV6 model was rebadged and sold in the United States as Cadillac Catera between 1997 and 2001. The Omega B&#x27;s platform was also modified to form the basis of the Australian third-generation Holden Commodore up to 2006, commencing with the 1997 VT series. This generation also helped succeed the Opel Senator as GM&#x27;s executive car offering in European markets. The Vauxhall version was the first to feature the brand&#x27;s corporate &#x27;V&#x27; grille which also appeared on the facelifted MK3 Astra later in 1994. 

This was 1995 Semperit Irish Car of the Year in Ireland, and 1995 RJC Car of the Year for Import Car of the Year in Japan.

Leaked images of a design studio mockup, featuring Opel badges and &quot;D&quot; plates, emerged in Europe in February 1990. The media at the time described the new saloon as coup√©-like, speculating a release in 1992 or 1993. Meanwhile, the Cadillac Aurora (which also served as the basis for the Oldsmobile Aurora) presented by General Motors at the 1990 Chicago Auto Show in February, was the concept car that bore close resemblance to the Omega B&#x27;s eventual design style.

===Facelift (B2; 1999‚Äì2003)===
The Omega B2 was launched in Autumn 1999 as a facelift of the B. It was distinguished by minor revisions to the front and rear styling, centre console, and the introduction of an electronic stability program. Gradually, new engines of slightly larger displacement also replaced the earlier ones; the new ones were generally Euro 3 emissions compliant.

Major changes:
*bonnet (grille now integrated with bonnet)
*Bumper fascias and bodyside mouldings
*Taillights
*Side mirrors
*New designs of alloy wheels
*Brand new central console with GPS, air conditioning, and controls
*Electronic stability program

===Engines===
The engines were not a major departure from the Omega A, aside from the shift from Opel&#x27;s own (outdated) 2.3-liter diesel to BMW&#x27;s M51 turbocharged inline-six. Originally with the model code U25DT, this was updated to the Euro 2 compliant X25DT engine during 1996.

In late 1999, the Omega received a facelift and a 2.2¬†L 16-valve engine was added to the range as an eventual replacement for the 2.0¬†L which was discontinued within a year.

The following year, a 3.2¬†L V6 engine replaced the 3.0¬†L V6 unit, and a 2.6¬†L V6 engine replaced the 2.5¬†L V6 unit. 2001 brought also brand new diesel 2.5 DTI engine from BMW, with a &quot;common rail&quot; fuel system.

===Engines===


==Omega V8 (prototypes)==
In an effort to better compete with the BMW 5 Series and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Opel decided to install a V8 engine into what was at the time their flagship model, the Opel Omega. Prototypes of sedan and station wagon versions were built (equipped with multimedia systems, and named V8.com).

===Omega V8.com===
The V8.com concept car project was meant to be a &quot;mobile office&quot; it was built on Omega station wagon, which was elongated by 130¬†mm, to provide more space for the passengers and additional equipment; it contained separate 9.5-inch LCD screens for all passengers, Internet access, and integrated video conference mobile phone system with separate cameras and microphones providing passengers hands-free operation ‚Äì hence the name.

The car was also equipped with xenon headlights, and Advanced Frontlighting System, automatically adjustable to the road conditions. It was powered by a GM LS1 V8 engine.

The car debuted at Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1999.

===Omega V8===
Opel was planning to upgrade its flagship Omega model with a powerful GM LS1 V8 engine used in the Chevrolet Corvette. Unlike the V8.com which was a concept car, this model was intended to go into serial production. The Omega V8 was shown publicly for the first time at the 70th Geneva Motor Show (2‚Äì12 March 2000). The V8-engined version was to be put on sale in Autumn 2000, but it was cancelled after 32 pre-series cars had been completed.

The reasons for cancelling production plans were concerns regarding the transmission and about whether the engine was &quot;vollgasfest&quot; (German, &quot;full throttle resistant&quot;). The engine might overheat and be damaged if driven flat out on the Autobahn for long periods of time. While cooling was resolved by using the larger Holden Commodore radiator, the transmission problem remained. The Chevrolet Corvette (C5) had a transaxle transmission; the only gearbox suitable for the Omega V8 was the GM 4L60-E 4-speed automatic transmission. However, the transmission&#x27;s flexplate repeatedly broke at during the &quot;vollgasfest&quot; test. The solution to this problem would take longer than the planned production of the Omega.

Holden did equip its Commodore (which was a reengineered Omega for Australian market) with the same V8 engine. A version of this platform was used for the Holden Monaro, which was marketed in the United States as the fourth-generation Pontiac GTO, and in the United Kingdom as the Vauxhall Monaro.

==Worldwide markets==

*In the United Kingdom, the Omega A was marketed as the second-generation Vauxhall Carlton (the first-generation Vauxhall Carlton having been a rebadged Opel Rekord) E2, and the Omega B generation as Vauxhall Omega. Between 2001 and 2007, Vauxhall sold the Australian-made Monaro coupe, which was derived from the Holden Commodore, itself based on the Omega B platform.
*In Brazil, between August 1992 and 1998, the Omega A was built and marketed as a Chevrolet Omega sedan or Omega Suprema in station wagon form (station wagon production ended in 1996). Between 1999 and 2006, this Chevrolet was the Omega B-derived Holden Commodore imported from Australia.
*In North America, a badge-engineered version of the Omega B and Omega B FL was marketed as the Cadillac Catera. Between 2004 and 2006, Pontiac reintroduced and sold its GTO as a coupe based on the Australian-made Monaro, which was derived from the Holden Commodore.
*In Australia, reengineered versions of the Opel Omega A were manufactured by Holden (a GM subsidiary) as the second generation Commodore and its derivates (including long wheelbase wagons, utility and luxury sedans, Statesman and Caprice) between 1988 and 1997. Between 1997 and 2006, Holden instead adapted the Omega B for its third generation as the Commodore and derivates, which now also included the Monaro coupe.

These Australian sedans are larger in all body dimensions and have featured less sophisticated suspension designs, different interior styling, and powertrains ranging from a Buick-derived 3.8-litre V6 between 1988 and 2003 or 5.0-litre V8 between 1988 and 1999, both manufactured by Holden, to a new 3.6-litre V6 from 2003 also built and exported by Holden and fully imported Chevrolet V8 engines, beginning with a 5.7 litre version in 1999, upgraded to a 260¬†kW 6.0 litre version in 2006. These vehicles were equally available in New Zealand.
* Since 1999, the Omega B based second generation Holden Commodore and its derivatives were exported to North America, Brazil, and the United Kingdom in sedan and coupe form as noted above, but also as a Chevrolet Lumina in the Middle East and South Africa. The Holden Commodore&#x27;s 1999 long-wheelbase luxury derivative, WH-series Statesman/Caprice, was also exported to the Middle East as the fifth-generation Holden Caprice. In 2005, as the WK Statesman, this vehicle was sold in China as the Buick Royaum and in Korea as the Daewoo Statesman.
* The Omega was one of the first models introduced by Opel after their return to the Philippines in 1997. Shortly after the brand&#x27;s discontinuation in the Philippine market, it was replaced by the Chevrolet Lumina, but instead of being based on the Holden Commodore like other markets, the Philippines received a rebadged Chinese-market Buick Regal sourced from Shanghai GM.

===End of the Omega===
In the United Kingdom, the Vauxhall Omega proved to be a successful model, despite being slated in many reviews for heavy depreciation and unreliability. Omegas and Carltons were a regular sight on United Kingdom roads, sporting police livery and as covert traffic surveillance cars. However, just four years after the introduction of its latest incarnation, Omega B2, and seventeen years since introduction of Omega A, production of this model ended. On 25 June 2003, the last Omega rolled out of the factory in R√ºsselsheim ‚Äì it was a silver 3.2¬†L V6 Omega B2, number 797,011.

Following the demise of its direct rivals, the Ford Scorpio and Rover 800, the former due to its controversial styling, Opel/Vauxhall found themselves competing against BMW&#x27;s 5 Series, with minimal sales success. Apart from the Australian re-engineered Holden Commodore models that carried on until 2006 for the sedan (wagons and utilities until 2007), production of the Omega ended in 2003. The position that the Omega held as Opel&#x27;s flagship model (after the demise of the Senator) would be taken over by the smaller Opel Signum which used an extended-length platform of the Opel Vectra and incorporated practical features of both MPVs and station wagons into one package. Remaining stocks were sold into 2004. In the Philippines, the Omega was replaced by the Chevrolet Lumina.

Stories and photographs of a &quot;new&quot; successor appeared in the motoring press one year later. In the case of &quot;Auto Express&quot;, though, its October 2004 article simply featured the Holden Torana TT36 concept car, which itself previewed the 2006 Holden Commodore. Nevertheless, Holden contributed in the Omega badge remaining alive by it, for the entry-level model of its new Commodore. Unlike prior models since 1978, this new Holden was no longer based on an Omega platform. Ironically, a version of this Commodore would get exported to the UK market as the Vauxhall VXR8 from 2007 to 2017, effectively becoming the flagship of the brand. Being a high-performance sports sedan, it was the first such vehicle in Vauxhall&#x27;s lineup since the Lotus Carlton/Omega.

As of July 2020, only 3297 Vauxhall Omegas and 306 Carltons (including some rebadged Rekords) are left on the road in the United Kingdom.

<text>A mail carrier, also referred to as a mailman, mailwoman, mailperson, postal carrier, postman, postwoman, postperson, person of post, letter carrier (in American English), or colloquially postie (in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom), is an employee of a post office or postal service who delivers mail and parcel post to residences and businesses. The term &quot;mail carrier&quot; came to be used as a gender-neutral substitute for &quot;mailman&quot; soon after women began performing the job. In the Royal Mail, the official name changed from &quot;letter carrier&quot; to &quot;postman&quot; in 1883, and &quot;postwoman&quot; has also been used for many years.

==United States==
In the United States, there are three types of mail carriers: City Letter Carriers, who are represented by the National Association of Letter Carriers; Rural Carriers, who are represented by the National Rural Letter Carriers&#x27; Association; and Highway Contract Route carriers, who are independent contractors. While union membership is voluntary, city carriers are organized nearly 93 percent nationally.

Letter carriers are paid hourly with the potential for overtime. They are also subject to &quot;pivoting&quot; on a daily basis. When a carrier&#x27;s assigned route will take less than 8 hours to complete, management may &quot;pivot&quot; said carrier to work on another route to fill that carrier up to 8 hours. Postal management uses this tool to redistribute and eliminate overtime costs, based on consultation with the carrier about his/her estimated workload for the day and mail volume projections from the DOIS (Delivery Operations Information System) computer program. Routes are adjusted and/or eliminated based on information (length, time, and overall workload) controlled by the program, consultations with the carrier assigned to the route, and a current PS Form 3999 (street observation by a postal supervisor to determine accurate times spent on actual delivery of mail).

Rural carriers are under a form of salary called &quot;evaluated hours&quot;, usually with overtime built into their pay. The evaluated hours are created by having all mail counted for a period of two or four weeks, and a formula used to create the set dollar amount they will be paid for each day worked until the next time the route is counted. 

Highway Contract Routes are awarded to the lowest bidder, and that person then either carries the route themselves or hires carriers to fulfill their contract to deliver the mail.

Letter carriers typically work urban routes that are high density and low mileage. Such routes are classified as either &quot;mounted&quot; routes (for those that require a vehicle) or &quot;walking&quot; routes (for those that are done on foot). When working a mounted route, letter carriers usually drive distinctive white vans with the logo of the United States Postal Service on the side and deliver to curbside and building affixed mailboxes.
Carriers who walk generally also drive postal vehicles to their routes, park at a specified location, and carry one &quot;loop&quot; of mail, up one side of the street and back down the other side, until they are back to their vehicle. This method of delivery is referred to as &quot;park and loop&quot;. Letter carriers may also accommodate alternate delivery points if &quot;extreme physical hardship&quot; is confirmed. In cases where mail carriers do not have assigned vehicles, they may also get undelivered mail from relay boxes placed along their routes.Rural carriers typically work routes that have a lower density and higher mileage than those of letter carriers. They all work mounted routes, leaving their vehicles only to deliver to group mailboxes or to deliver an article that must be taken to a customer&#x27;s door. However, with former rural areas being urbanized, their routes are growing very similar to mounted &quot;city routes.&quot; Rural carriers often use their own vehicles and are not required to wear a uniform. Because of urbanization around cities and because rural carriers deliver mail at less cost to the Postal Service, the rural carrier craft is the only craft in the Postal Service that is growing.

Highway Contract Route carriers work routes that were established with a density of less than one customer per mile driven (some later become denser and can then be converted to rural delivery). They are only mounted routes, and all HCR carriers use their own vehicle. These routes are typically found in outlying areas, or around very small communities.

The three types of mail carriers are also hired differently. A new letter carrier begins as a City Carrier Assistant (CCA). Rural carriers are hired as Rural Carrier Associate (RCA) carriers, without benefits. There is normally an RCA assigned to each rural route and they typically work less frequently than city CCAs. As a result, there are thousands of RCA positions that go unfilled due to lack of applicants that are instead covered by other RCAs until hiring improves for the hiring process explained). Highway Contract Route carriers are hired by the winning bidder for that route. They are not United States Postal Service employees and normally receive lower pay than carriers on city or rural routes.

===Female carriers===

Women have been transporting mail in the United States since the late 1800s. According to the United States Post Office archive, &quot;the first known appointment of a woman to carry mail was on 3 April 1845, when Postmaster General Cave Johnson appointed Sarah Black to carry the mail between Charlestown Md P.O. &amp; the Rail Road &quot;daily or as often as requisite at $48 per annum&quot;. For at least two years Black served as a mail messenger, ferrying the mail between Charlestown&#x27;s train depot and its post office.&quot;

At least two women, Susanna A. Brunner in New York and Minnie Westman in Oregon, were known to be mail carriers in the 1880s. Mary Fields, nicknamed &quot;Stagecoach Mary&quot;, was the first black woman to work for the USPS, driving a stagecoach in Montana from 1895 until the early 1900s. When aviation introduced airmail, the first woman mail pilot was Katherine Stinson who dropped mailbags from her plane at the Montana State Fair in September 1913.

The first women city carriers were appointed in World War I and by 2007, about 59,700 women served as city carriers and 36,600 as rural carriers representing 40 per cent of the carrier force.

<text>Robert Del Naja (; born 21 January 1965), also known as 3D, is a British artist, musician, singer and songwriter. He emerged as a graffiti artist and member of the Bristol collective the Wild Bunch, and later as a founding member and sole consistent member of the band Massive Attack, with which he is still active. In 2009, he received the British Academy&#x27;s Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.

==Music==
Del Naja started rapping with the Wild Bunch in Bristol in the mid-1980s. He is one of the founding members of Bristol trip hop collective Massive Attack, with Daddy G (Grant Marshall), Tricky (Adrian Thaws) and Andrew Vowles, as a music producer and the only vocalist to feature on all their albums and EPs. The band received critical acclaim with their first album &quot;Blue Lines&quot;, released in 1991.

From 1997 to 1998, Del Naja was the band&#x27;s main producer in the recording sessions that made &quot;Mezzanine&quot;, Massive Attack&#x27;s most commercially successful album, selling nearly 4 million copies, with Neil Davidge as a sound engineer.

In addition to his work with Massive Attack, he provided vocals to &quot;Invasion&quot; on Unkle&#x27;s album &quot;Never, Never, Land&quot;, and &quot;Twilight&quot; on &quot;War Stories&quot;.

Del Naja has co-written a number of film scores and tracks for films with Neil Davidge and with Euan Dickinson. &quot;Herculaneum&quot;, the title track for Italian director Matteo Garrone&#x27;s 2008 award-winning film &quot;Gomorrah&quot;, based on the book by Roberto Saviano about organised crime in Naples, received the prize for best song at the David Di Donatello Awards.

In December 2012, Del Naja released the first single of his new project called the Battle Box, which fuses music, art and discourse across one-off live events, exhibitions and exclusive vinyl releases. He counted with the collaboration of artists such as Guy Garvey, Noel Gallagher, Jupiter Bokondji and the Higgins Waterproof Black Magic Band.

In December 2014, Del Naja donated ten unreleased music tracks to the Game Jam site Ludum Dare, for a game event taking place in December. The songs will be used by the site developers to make soundtracks for the games. This new music material is available for free download.

In February 2015, Del Naja and Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke released the soundtrack for the documentary &quot;The UK Gold&quot;. The songs are available for free download.

In 2015 he collaborated with Jean-Michel Jarre on the &quot;Electronica 1: The Time Machine&quot; album, resulting in the track &quot;Watching You&quot;.

==Art work==
Del Naja was a graffiti artist before becoming a producer and vocalist, and was featured in the 1987 book &quot;Spraycan Art&quot; by Henry Chalfant and James Prigoff and in the 1988 film &quot;Bombin&quot;&#x27;, directed by Dick Fontaine, alongside fellow artist and future drum and bass pioneer Goldie.

He is regarded as one of those who brought hip hop and graffiti culture from the United States to Bristol in the early 1980s. He has previously been the subject of speculation that he is anonymous artist Banksy.

Del Naja&#x27;s work has been featured on all of Massive Attack&#x27;s record sleeves.

Since 2003, Del Naja has co-designed all of Massive Attack&#x27;s lighting shows with UVA; the shows have been overtly political, dealing with local and international issues.

Del Naja and Massive Attack&#x27;s producer Neil Davidge collaborated with United Visual Artists on the large scale installation &quot;Volume&quot; at London&#x27;s V&amp;A museum in 2006. It consists of a field of 48 luminous, sound-emitting columns that respond to movement. Visitors weave a path through the sculpture, creating their own unique journey in light and music.

Del Naja took part in a group show in 2007 called &quot;Warpaint&quot; at the Lazarides Gallery in London, featuring his art from the Unkle album &quot;War Stories&quot;. He created an exhibition of flags at Massive Attack&#x27;s Meltdown Festival on London&#x27;s Southbank Centre in 2008. The installation was called &quot;Favoured Nations&quot;. In the exhibition, alternative flags of the British Commonwealth were recoloured in the anarchist red and black and hung from the ceiling of the Royal Festival Hall main floor.
In a 2010 interview, Del Naja said &quot;Painting is difficult for me because I&#x27;m colour blind. Back in the day, I had to label my spray cans with what colour they were because I couldn&#x27;t tell. It&#x27;s like the emperor&#x27;s new clothes: [people] telling me it&#x27;s great, and me pretending that&#x27;s what I intended.&quot; 

Del Naja had his largest solo art show at the Lazarides gallery in central London from 24 May to 22 June 2013. The show&#x27;s content spanned a period of over twenty years and featured many of the art pieces that Del Naja created for Massive Attack. Each piece, reinterpreted especially for the exhibition, was hand-printed and finished. The show featured three one-off &#x27;digital infinity mirrors&#x27; two of which contained phrases supplied by Reprieve extracted from drone pilot dialogues. Del Naja and Grant DJ&#x27;d at the opening night on 23 May.


A multi-medium show conceived and designed by Del Naja and filmmaker Adam Curtis ‚Äì in collaboration with United Visual Artists (UVA) ‚Äì premiered in Manchester in July 2013. The show featured a Curtis film, unofficially titled &quot;The Plan&quot;, which was projected onto a huge screen surrounding the audience. The lighting and LED elements that surrounded the film and players were designed by Del Naja and UVA.
Del Naja orchestrated the show&#x27;s soundtrack, and the music later became part of the score for Curtis&#x27; BBC production entitled HyperNormalisation in 2016.

In 2015, Del Naja published a book of photographs, art, and stories that spanned his entire career titled &quot;3D and the Art of Massive Attack&quot;.

During the COVID lockdown, on 19 May 2020 Del Naja launched his Fire Sale website store, selling &quot;Protection&quot;, a limited-edition print, in aid of the Bristol Food Union. The print raised more than ¬£100,000 for the charity.

In July 2020, Massive Attack released a political audiovisual EP called &quot;Eutopia&quot;: The 3x track fusion was created across five cities during the Covid-19 global lockdown period. The project was co-written and produced by 3D and Mark Donne, featuring strong arguments for global system change from UN Paris Climate Agreement author Christiana Figueres, founder of the universal basic income principle professor Guy Standing and inventor of the US wealth tax policy Professor Gabriel Zucman.

In June 2021, Del Naja was presented with a Royal College of Art honorary doctorate - nominated and presented by Sir Jony Ive.

In March 2022, he started again selling off artwork to help victims of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, with proceeds to go to the Disasters Emergency Committee&#x27;s humanitarian appeal.

== Technology==
In 2016, Massive Attack released their EP &quot;Ritual Spirit&quot; as part of a procedural music app called Fantom (with a new version developed in 2019). The &quot;sensory remixer&quot; lets people create unique versions of tracks, with the app taking into account variables like movement, time of day or night, location and what a user&#x27;s phone camera can see. An Apple Watch version of the app that varies the song&#x27;s rhythm and harmony based on heartbeat was developed, while live social media notifications sent via a Twitter feed triggered alternative real time mix events.

In 2019, Del Naja and Adam Curtis teamed up for a second time on a live show based on the band&#x27;s &quot;Mezzanine&quot; album.

==Musical scene and artistic peers==
Del Naja&#x27;s music has been associated with the Bristol sound. He said of the Bristol Scene: &quot;We all grew up listening to punk music and funk stuff and those attitudes sort of snuck into our music. That sort of brought people from different circles together and maybe it wasn&#x27;t as &#x27;cultural melting pot&#x27; as it all sounds but because Bristol is quite a small place, it becomes a lot more focused then.&quot;

==Activism and politics==

Del Naja has been critical of the government policies of the United Kingdom. He was strongly opposed to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and with fellow musician Damon Albarn personally paid for full-page adverts in the &quot;NME&quot; magazine. On the eve of the invasion of Iraq, they tried to organise a group of prominent musicians into an anti-war campaign, only according to Del Naja to be greeted with silence bordering on hostility.

Massive Attack have previously played two shows in Israel, but have declined recent offers. They have described this &quot;not an action of aggression towards the Israeli people&quot; but &quot;towards the [Israeli] government and its policies&quot;, arguing that &quot;the Palestinians [in Gaza and the West Bank] have no access to the same fundamental benefits that the Israelis do.&quot;

In 2005, Del Naja organised and performed at a charity concert in Bristol for Tsunami Relief with Adrian Utley and Geoff Barrow of Portishead. The two-night event featured Massive Attack, Portishead, Robert Plant, The Coral and Damon Albarn. Del Naja and Marshall performed three shows in 2005 in support of Hoping, an organisation that helps raise money, support projects for Palestinian youth in refugee camps in the Gaza strip and the West Bank, Lebanon and Syria.

Del Naja and Thom Yorke of Radiohead threw a Christmas party at an occupied UBS bank in London in December 2011, in recognition and support for the international Occupy movement.

Having previously boycotted playing at Bristol&#x27;s Colston Hall due to its connection with the city&#x27;s historic slave trade, in October 2012, Del Naja heavily criticised Bristol Mayor candidate George Ferguson because of his membership of a local organisation the Society of Merchant Venturers. The organisation dates back to the 16th century and had many connections with the Bristol slave trade, continuing to this day as an elitist private organisation, open to very few by invitation only. In November 2012, Del Naja then took a surprising stance to reverse his position and endorse Ferguson. Del Naja was cited by local media as saying that the other candidates had only party political agendas at heart and a newly elected mayor needed more imagination to help implement creative projects for Bristol.

In July 2014, Del Naja and Grant Marshall visited the Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp in Lebanon to meet with Palestinian volunteers at an educational centre. The band&#x27;s profit from the show in Byblos was donated to the centre.

In 2016, Del Naja worked with photographer Giles Duley to show their support for refugees; Massive Attack used his photographs from different sites of the crisis for their new show.

From 2018, Del Naja has been supporting the climate activists of the Extinction Rebellion group, which have conducted protests in London since October 2018. In April, he played a DJ set for the Extinction Rebellion protesters in the heart of London in Marble Arch. In July and October 2019, the group protested in 60 other cities worldwide and Del Naja provided a portable radio network using speakers in backpacks with receivers and transmitters for the campaigners in London. Massive Attack concluded their Mezzanine XXI tour of the US in October by organising a benefit gig at Webster Hall in NYC to help pay protestors&#x27; legal fees.

In November 2019, along with other public figures, Massive Attack signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn describing him as &quot;a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world&quot; and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election.

On 28 November 2019, Del Naja announced that Massive Attack partnered with a research centre based at the University of Manchester to explore the music industry&#x27;s climate impact. He wrote in a column in The Guardian: &quot;The commissioning of the renowned Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research to map the full carbon footprint of typical tour cycles, and to look specifically at the three key areas where CO2 emissions in our sector are generated&quot;.

In May 2020, during the Covid-19 lockdown, 3D called for more government support to be given to those in food poverty after a print fundraising sale in his home town of Bristol raised more than ¬£100,000 to help feed frontline workers and at-risk groups.

During the spring 2020, 3D also worked on a Massive Attack political audiovisual EP called &quot;Eutopia&quot;, consisting of 3 track fusion created across 5 cities during the Covid-19 global lockdown period, with documentary filmmaker Mark Donne, AI art pioneer Mario Klingemann and vocal collaborations with Algiers, Young Fathers and poet Saul Williams. The conceptual project, co-written and produced by 3D and Donne, features strong arguments for global system change from UN Paris Climate Agreement author Christiana Figueres, founder of the universal basic income principle professor Guy Standing and inventor of the US wealth tax policy Professor Gabriel Zucman. Each video ends with a quote from Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot;. He is mentioned in the credits of Adam Curtis&#x27; 2022 film &quot;Traumazone&quot;, which documents Russia between 1985 and 1999.

==Personal life==
Del Naja was brought up in Bristol. His father was from Naples, Italy, and as a result he is a supporter of the S.S.C. Napoli football team, as well as Bristol City. Del Naja was arrested and cautioned twice in Bristol during the 1980s for painting graffiti and made to do community service.

Del Naja attended state school in Filton, Bristol, but did not complete his A-levels.

<text>Quetteville () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

The name of the city is derived from the Latin &quot;Ketelvilla&quot;, meaning Ketil&#x27;s villa. Ketil was probably the name of a Viking settler.

The surname &quot;DeQuetteville&quot; is derived from the city&#x27;s name.

<doc id="620860" wikidata="Q354765" url="?curid=620860" title="Chimta">
<text>Chimta (, Shahmukhƒ´: ) literally means tongs. Over time it has evolved into a traditional instrument of South Asia by the permanent addition of small brass jingles. This instrument is often used in popular Punjabi folk songs, Bhangra music and the Sikh religious music known as Gurbani Kirtan.

The player of the chimta is able to produce a chiming sound if he holds the joint of the instrument in one hand and strikes the two sides of the chimta together. The jingles are made of metal and thus it produces a metallic sound and helps to keep up the beat of the song.

In Bhangra music or at weddings it is often combined with Dhol and Bhangra dancers.

== Construction and design ==
The chimta consists of a long, flat piece of steel or iron that is pointed at both ends, and folded over in the middle. A metal ring is attached near the fold, and there are jingles or rings attached along the sides at regular intervals. Sometimes there are seven pairs of jingles. The rings are plucked in a downward motion to produce tinkling sounds. Chimtas with large rings are used at rural festivals while ones with smaller rings are often used as an accompaniment to Bhangra dancers and singers of traditional Indian hymns.

== Notable players ==
The late Alam Lohar is famous for playing this instrument and introducing it to global audiences. Today, musicians like Kamal Heer and Arif Lohar play this instrument. Also known as the &quot;rusty tambourine sword&quot;, the chimta has been played by members of the experimental rock band His Name Is Alive on recent tours.

<text>Quimperl√© (; ) is a commune in the Finist√®re department, region of Brittany, northwestern France.

==Geography==
Quimperl√© is in the southeast of Finist√®re, 20¬†km to the west of Lorient and 44¬†km to the east of Quimper. Historically, it belongs to Cornouaille. The town is situated at the confluence of the Isole and Ell√© rivers that combine to form the La√Øta river, hence its name: confluent (kemper-) of the Ell√© (-le). A fourth smaller river, the Dourdu (black water in Breton), joins the La√Øta downstream. Quimperl√© station has rail connections to Quimper, Lorient, Vannes and Rennes.

The city is traditionally divided in two parts, the High Town and the Lower Town. The Lower Town, in the valley, is the historical centre, and developed around the Saint-Colomban church (of which only the front wall remains) and the abbey of Sainte Croix (Holy Cross). It covers the land between the Ell√© and Isole rivers as well as the banks of the La√Øta, an area that is sometimes flooded.

The more modern High Town, in the plain above the valley, centres around the Saint-Michel church and its market square. Seen from the Lower Town, its &quot;mountain&quot; topped with the Saint-Michel church has earned Quimperl√© the nickname of &quot;Mount Saint Michel on land&quot;

The town also developed, less importantly, on the East side of the valley, facing the Saint Michel mountain. This area is called Bourgneuf, a common name for recent neighbourhoods.

==Map==

==Population==
Inhabitants of Quimperl√© are called in French &quot;Quimperlois&quot;.

==History==
It seems that the area was first inhabited by Neanderthals, since remains of Mousterian-style stone tools have been found in the forest between Quimperl√© and Clohars-Carno√´t. A few dolmens were erected in Quimperl√© itself, although there is no trace of an actual settlement in the prehistoric times.

A first settlement was built in the Middle Ages, called Villa Anaurot, after a 5th-century British prince, but it is thought to have been destroyed by the Normans in 868.

A new town called Quimperl√© grew around the abbey of Sainte Croix, which was founded in the 12th century. The Romanesque basilica from the abbey can still be seen. The church of St Michel was built in the 14th and 15th centuries and its impressive tower dominates the town from its hilltop position.

==Breton language==
*The municipality launched a linguistic plan concerning the Breton language through Ya d&#x27;ar brezhoneg on 18 December 2008.
*In 2008, 3.17% of primary-school children attended bilingual schools.

<doc id="620875" wikidata="Q777151" url="?curid=620875" title="Serizawa Kamo">
<text>Serizawa Kamo (ËäπÊ≤¢ È¥®; September 2, 1826 ‚Äì October 30, 1863) was a samurai known for being the original lead commander of the Shinsengumi. He trained in and received a licence in the Shind≈ç Munen-ry≈´. &quot;Kamo&quot; means goose or duck in Japanese which was an odd name to call oneself at the time. His full name was &quot;Serizawa Kamo Taira no Mitsumoto&quot;.

==Background==
The Serizawa family were upper-seat Goshi rank samurai in Serizawa village in Mito which is now the capital of Ibaraki Prefecture in Japan. Kamo was born as the youngest son and his childhood name was Genta. He had two older brothers and an older sister. He was educated with the Sonn≈ç j≈çi ideals (meaning revere the Tenno (emperor) and expel the foreigners) and swordsmanship since childhood at Kodoukan which was a state school in Mito. Mito is a sub-branch of the Tokugawa family and it was considered the motherland of the Sonn≈ç J≈çi ideology and was a center of support for the Tenn≈ç and the Imperial court, which helped fuel the Revolution.

Although no portrait of Kamo remains, it is said he was a large man with very pale skin and small eyes.

On one hand, Serizawa was quite bold and fearless and on the other hand, he was extremely selfish and had a terribly short temper so he started fights often. If he was in a bad mood he would get violent, especially when he was drinking, and he was a heavy drinker. He was an idealist who held very strong pro-Imperial court beliefs and took the Sonno-joi beliefs very seriously while at the same time siding with the Tokugawa regime. A less well-known fact is that Serizawa was good at drawing and showed his drawings to children.

==Tenguto Period==
Kamo was the priest for a Shinto temple under the Kimura family. He married the daughter of the Kimura family, so his name was changed to Kimura Keiji. In 1860, he took part in an extremist anti-foreigner group &quot;Tengu-to&quot; (alternative name is Tamazukurisei) which assassinated Tairo Ii Naosuke. He made a name for himself as he joined the higher ranks of the group. What is little known that he was originally supposed to participate in the famous Tairo assassination, but he was not able to make it in time. In early 1861, he found out that three of the younger members in the group had broken the rules, causing him to lose his temper; he made them sit in a line and beheaded them all at once. He was jailed within the Tengu-to group for executing them without any permission. When political power shifted to the pro-Tokugawa government, those in the Tengu-to were jailed for their involvement on the assassination of Ii. There, he wrote this famous poem written on his ripped piece of clothing with his own blood from biting his pinky finger:

:Yukishimo ni
:Iroyoku hana no
:Sakigakete
:Chiritemo nochi ni
:Nihou ume ga ka

This roughly translates as:

:In the snow and frost,
:The color remains,
:And still giving off its scent after the scattering of the petals;
:Such ume is the perfume.

Many were surprised at Kamo&#x27;s never-before-demonstrated poetic talent. Serizawa was released in late 1862 when the government started to weaken and political power shifted back to the anti-foreigners. Then, he changed his name from Kimura Keiji to &quot;Serizawa Kamo&quot; after his release. He later joined Kiyokawa Hachirou&#x27;s &quot;Roushigumi&quot;.

==Mibu Roushigumi/Shinsengumi Period==
After their arrival in Kyoto, Serizawa and Kond≈ç Isami&#x27;s group separated from the Roushigumi, becoming an independent group. A few weeks later, Serizawa and Kond≈ç decided to submit a letter to the Aizu clan asking to join them in policing Kyoto. The Aizu clan were assigned by the Tokugawa regime to police the streets in Kyoto by samurai (most of them lower-class samurai from Ch≈çsh≈´, Tosa, and other states) who rampantly started fights and committed assassinations. The idea of working under the Aizu may have originated with Serizawa&#x27;s older brother, who had connections with the Aizu clan. The Aizu clan accepted the letter&#x27;s request, making the twenty-two samurai into a group under the Aizu clan.

It was then that the group began calling themselves the Mibu Roushigumi and Serizawa becomes joint captain of the group with Kond≈ç. 
However, Serizawa started numerous incidents. On July 18 (lunar calendar June 3), Aizu commanded Mibu Roushigumi members to police Osaka. Serizawa and his group were out drinking and later Serizawa got in a fight with a sumo wrestler. This created a conflict with the 25-30 wrestlers in the same dojo. Serizawa&#x27;s group had only ten or so members but managed to overcome their attackers. At the end ten wrestlers were dead and the rest had sustained serious injuries, yet Serizawa&#x27;s group barely had any injuries at all. News of this incident spread quickly, adding to the Mibu Roushigumi&#x27;s notoriety. Later in June, Serizawa had a drinking gathering with his members in a restaurant in Shimabara. He lost his temper while drinking and wrecked the whole restaurant; the restaurant had to be closed for business because of it. On September 25 (lunar calendar August 13), Serizawa and his group destroyed Yamatoya, a silk cloth store, in daylight with a cannon given to the group by the Aizu clan when they would not give them money.

==Death==
On October 19 (lunar calendar September 10), Niimi Nishiki, who was a sub-captain of the Shinsengumi, was ordered to commit seppuku by Hijikata and Yamanami. Most likely, this was the beginning of the plan by the Kond≈ç faction to expel Serizawa and his allies. When Serizawa, Hirayama, and Hirama found out about the involuntary seppuku, they were unable to retaliate because in August they had started recruiting many of their members to side with Kond≈ç. Noguchi Kenji, who was a fukuchou jokin and a member of Serizawa&#x27;s group, was not in Mibu village at this time of the assassination. But there is a possibility that Niimi was forced to commit seppuku by a Mito samurai for the murder of a Mibu Roushigumi member and Kond≈ç&#x27;s group was not involved with his death. Therefore, Serizawa&#x27;s group may have &quot;not&quot; known about Kond≈ç&#x27;s assassination plans.

On October 30 (lunar calendar September 18; however there is debate that it could have happened 2 days earlier in October 28), all of the Shinsengumi had a drinking party at which was a plan to assassinate Serizawa. The selected few led by Hijikata went into the house of Yagi Gennoj≈ç that night, Serizawa was then assassinated along with Oume, a woman who was sleeping with him, and also Hirayama. Hirama, the sole survivor in Serizawa&#x27;s group, managed to flee back to Mito where he reported Serizawa Kamo&#x27;s death to his family. The assassination was carried out under Matsudaira Katamori&#x27;s order. Three months later, on February 4, 1864 (lunar calendar December 27, 1863), Noguchi was ordered to commit seppuku by the Shinsengumi.

===Assassination===
There is some debate about who exactly was involved with killing Serizawa. Obviously those chosen to take part in the plot would have been members that Kondo and Hijikata trusted and also able to keep it a secret. The lineup was most likely Hijikata, Okita, Yamanami Keisuke, Inoue, and Harada. There is an alternative theory that the assassination was done by Hijikata, T≈çd≈ç, Sait≈ç and Harada. It is highly unlikely that Kond≈ç himself was involved with the assassination because it would have been too risky to get the next lead captain injured or killed.

There have been a number of theories about the motive for the assassination:

* &quot;Serizawa was too out of hand, so Aizu secretly planned to assassinate Serizawa Kamo with Kond≈ç and Hijikata.&quot;

This is the most mainstream and widely-believed theory. It&#x27;s quite possible that both Aizu and Kond≈ç felt Serizawa was too reckless to be the lead captain of a group that was intended to regulate peace in Kyoto, and one who would react violently to dismissal.

* &quot;The Mito clan was thinking of taking Serizawa&#x27;s Mibu Roushigumi to the fore-runner of sonno joi. Aizu clan felt this was a threat because they are more pro-Tokugawa than pro-Imperial court like Mito, so they commanded Kondo to assassinate Serizawa&#x27;s group.&quot;

This is a lesser-known theory. The Aizu clan could have commanded Kond≈ç to assassinate Serizawa because he was reckless in order to hide the true motive; an underlying political conflict with Mito. Aizu was having trouble in Kyoto already from samurais from Ch≈çsh≈´ and Tosa causing violence openly in the streets, so they could have wanted to prevent Mito samurais from entering the blood bath of Kyoto. Then, extreme samurais from 3 states (Mito, Ch≈çsh≈´ and Tosa) were competing with each other carrying out terrorist actions against those who they believed were against anti-foreigner ideals. A Mito official in Kyoto could have been plotting to take Serizawa&#x27;s group and make them side with Mito.

* &quot;Kondo and Hijikata used Serizawa to have connections with Aizu and now that was accomplished they eliminated Serizawa&#x27;s group to take a hold of the group.&quot;

It&#x27;s likely that Kondo and Hijikata hated Serizawa in the first place. But, they probably wouldn&#x27;t have been able to form Mibu Roushigumi, which later became the Shinsengumi, if it wasn&#x27;t for Serizawa&#x27;s brother&#x27;s close relations with the Aizu clan; they allowed him to be lead captain because they were just using him to get connections with Aizu. When they felt they securely had the trust to Aizu they assassinated Serizawa because they no longer needed him. It is possible that they also kept the assassination in the dark from the Aizu clan since they have reported Serizawa&#x27;s cause of death from illness.

===Grave===
Kond≈ç&#x27;s group held a funeral for his death and Serizawa&#x27;s older brother came to it. His grave was built a year after his death in Mibu Temple and it still resides there today.

There is a quote about him from Nagakura Shinpachi:

‚óéÊñ∞ÈÅ∏ÁµÑÈ°õÊú´Ë®ò-Ê∞∏ÂÄâ Êñ∞ÂÖ´
ÁåõÁÉà„Å™Âã§ÁöáÊÄùÊÉ≥„ÇíÊä±„Åç„ÄÅ„Å§„Å≠„Å´ÊîòÂ§∑„ÇíÂè´„Çì„Åß„ÅÑ„Åü„ÄÇ

which roughly translates as:

&quot;He held extremely strong pro-Imperial court ideals and screamed for the expelling out of foreigners. Everyone called him &quot;sensei&quot;. He was that much of a man but he died when the country needed him. We felt this is not just a loss for him but a loss for the country&quot;.

==In popular culture==

Serizawa is featured in Shiba Ryotaro&#x27;s &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot; (&quot;Burn, O Sword&quot;) and &quot;Shinsengumi Keppuroku&quot; (&quot;Record of Shinsengumi Bloodshed&quot;).

He is also featured in the manga &quot;Kaze Hikaru&quot; as Commander Serizawa and is pictured as a jolly man, often red nosed from drunkenness but below his comic and often-perverted nature is also a fierce opponent who should not be underestimated. He is often seen on drinking fests with the rest of the Mibu clan or always trying to get a kiss from Kamiya Seizaburo (Tominaga Sei). He falls in love in with a woman named Oume. His fight with Sumo wrestlers and meeting Oume are historical facts based on the real-life story of Serizawa.

Serizawa&#x27;s assassination was portrayed in the anime version of &quot;Peacemaker Kurogane&quot;

Serizawa is featured in NHK Shinsengumi portrayed by K≈çichi Sat≈ç, as a powerful swordsman, with a short temper, yet he had a strong spirit, and a great love for his country. Four Shinsengumi members were sent to assassinate him: Hijikata, Okita, Harada, and Sannan. Okita foolishly swung his Katana and it got stuck on the lintel off a doorway. Serizawa broke Hijikata&#x27;s sword in two then slipped on his own bottle of sake. Okita stabbed him through the heart with his Kodachi, and Hijikata finished him off by stabbing him in the back.

In &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; the character Shishio Makoto is roughly based on Serizawa Kamo as said by the manga artist Nobuhiro Watsuki, creator of Rurouni Kenshin series, during an interview (contained in Kenshin Kaden).

Also included as a character in Hakuouki Reimeiroku, Serizawa plays a major role in the most recent series of the anime &quot;Haku≈çki&quot;.

In the 2014 game &quot;Ry≈´ ga Gotoku Ishin!&quot;, Serizawa Kamo kills Miburoshigumi captain In≈çe Genzaburo, and takes on the dead man&#x27;s identity at the behest of leader Kond≈ç Isami. He says that three of the existing captains must take on the role of the dead Mito faction members in order to keep the group alive, which he then renames the Shinsengumi.

<doc id="620879" wikidata="Q369262" url="?curid=620879" title="Growth hormone deficiency">
<text>Growth hormone deficiency (GHD), or hyposomatotropism, is a medical condition resulting from not enough growth hormone (GH). Generally the most noticeable symptom is that an individual attains a short height. Newborns may also present low blood sugar or a small penis size. In adults there may be decreased muscle mass, high cholesterol levels, or poor bone density.
GHD can be present at birth or develop later in life. Causes may include genetics, trauma, infections, tumors, or radiation therapy. Genes that may be involved include &quot;GH1&quot;, &quot;GHRHR&quot;, or &quot;BTK&quot;. In a third of cases no cause is apparent. The underlying mechanism generally involves problems with the pituitary gland. Some cases are associated with a lack of other pituitary hormones, in which case it is known as combined pituitary hormone deficiency. Diagnosis involves blood tests to measure growth hormone levels.
Treatment is by growth hormone replacement using synthetic human growth hormone. The frequency of the condition is unclear. Most cases are initially noticed in children. The genetic forms of this disease are estimated to affect about 1 in 7,000 people. Most types occur equally in males and females though males are more often diagnosed.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Child===
Severe prenatal deficiency of GH, as occurs in congenital hypopituitarism, has little effect on fetal growth. However, prenatal and congenital deficiency can reduce the size of a male&#x27;s penis, especially when gonadotropins are also deficient. Besides micropenis in males, additional consequences of severe deficiency in the first days of life can include hypoglycemia and exaggerated jaundice (both direct and indirect hyperbilirubinemia).

Even congenital GH deficiency does not usually impair length growth until after the first few months of life. From late in the first year until mid-teens, poor growth and/or shortness is the hallmark of childhood GH deficiency. Growth is not as severely affected in GH deficiency as in untreated hypothyroidism, but growth at about half the usual velocity for age is typical. It tends to be accompanied by delayed physical maturation so that bone maturation and puberty may be several years delayed. When severe GH deficiency is present from birth and never treated, adult heights can be as short as .

Severe GH deficiency in early childhood also results in slower muscular development, so that gross motor milestones such as standing, walking, and jumping may be delayed. Body composition (i.e., the relative amounts of bone, muscle, and fat) is affected in many children with severe deficiency, so that mild to moderate chubbiness is common (though GH deficiency alone rarely causes severe obesity). Some severely GH-deficient children have recognizable, cherubic facial features characterized by maxillary hypoplasia and forehead prominence.

Other side effects in children include sparse hair growth and frontal recession, and pili torti and trichorrhexis nodosa are also sometimes present.

===Adults===
Recognised effects include:
* Increased 5-alpha-reductase
* Reduced sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)
* Reduced muscle mass and strength
* Baldness in men
* Reduced bone mass and osteoporosis (Decreased bone density)
* Reduced energy
* Impaired concentration and memory loss
* Increased body fat, particularly around the waistline
* Lipid abnormalities, particularly raised LDL cholesterol
* Increased levels of fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor
* Cardiac dysfunction, including a thickened intima media
* Lack of well-being
* Depression and anxiety
* Social isolation
* Fibromyalgia syndrome
* Neuromuscular dysfunction
* Central adiposity
* Decreased muscle mass
* Insulin resistance
* Accelerated atherogenesis
* Prothrombotic state
* Decreased sweating and thermoregulation.

==Causes==
Growth hormone deficiency in childhood commonly has no identifiable cause (idiopathic), and adult-onset GHD is commonly due to pituitary tumours and their treatment or to cranial irradiation. A more complete list of causes includes:
* mutations of specific genes (e.g., &quot;GHRHR&quot;, &quot;GH1&quot;)
* congenital diseases such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Turner syndrome, or short-stature homeobox gene deficiency
* congenital malformations involving the pituitary (e.g., septo-optic dysplasia, posterior pituitary ectopia)
* chronic kidney disease
* intracranial tumors in or near the sella turcica, especially craniopharyngioma
* damage to the pituitary from radiation therapy to the head (e.g. for leukemia or brain tumors), from surgery, from trauma, or from intracranial disease (e.g. hydrocephalus)
* autoimmune inflammation (hypophysitis)
* ischemic or hemorrhagic infarction from low blood pressure (Sheehan syndrome) or hemorrhage pituitary apoplexy

There are a variety of rare diseases that resemble GH deficiency, including the childhood growth failure, facial appearance, delayed bone age, and low insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels. However, GH testing elicits normal or high levels of GH in the blood, demonstrating that the problem is not due to a deficiency of GH but rather to a reduced sensitivity to its action. Insensitivity to GH is traditionally termed Laron dwarfism, but over the last 15 years many different types of GH resistance have been identified, primarily involving mutations of the GH binding protein or receptors.

Familial isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) can be inherited as an autosomal recessive (type I), autosomal dominant (type II), or X-linked (type III) characteristic.

==Pathophysiology==
As an adult ages, it is normal for the pituitary to produce diminishing amounts of GH and many other hormones, particularly the sex steroids. Physicians, therefore, distinguish between the natural reduction in GH levels which comes with age, and the much lower levels of &quot;true&quot; deficiency. Such deficiency almost always has an identifiable cause, with adult-onset GHD &quot;without&quot; a definable cause (&quot;idiopathic GH deficiency&quot;) extremely rare. GH does function in adulthood to maintain muscle and bone mass and strength, and has poorly understood effects on cognition and mood.

==Diagnosis==
Although GH can be readily measured in a blood sample, testing for GH deficiency is constrained by the fact that levels are nearly undetectable for most of the day. This makes simple measurement of GH in a single blood sample useless for detecting deficiency. Physicians, therefore use a combination of indirect and direct criteria in assessing GHD, including:
* Auxologic criteria (defined by body measurements)
* Indirect hormonal criteria (IGF levels from a single blood sample)
* Direct hormonal criteria (measurement of GH in multiple blood samples to determine secretory patterns or responses to provocative testing), in particular:
** Subnormal frequency and amplitude of GH secretory peaks when sampled over several hours
** Subnormal GH secretion in response to at least two provocative stimuli
** Increased IGF1 levels after a few days of GH treatment
* Response to GH treatment
* Corroborative evidence of pituitary dysfunction

&quot;Provocative tests&quot; involve giving a dose of an agent that will normally provoke a pituitary to release a burst of growth hormone. An intravenous line is established, the agent is given, and small amounts of blood are drawn at 15-minute intervals over the next hour to determine if a rise of GH was provoked. Agents which have been used clinically to stimulate and assess GH secretion are arginine, levodopa, clonidine, epinephrine and propranolol, glucagon, and insulin. An insulin tolerance test has been shown to be reproducible, age-independent, and able to distinguish between GHD and normal adults, and so is the test of choice.

Severe GH deficiency in childhood additionally has the following measurable characteristics:
* Proportional stature well below that expected for family heights, although this characteristic may not be present in the case of familial-linked GH deficiency
* Below-normal velocity of growth
* Delayed physical maturation
* Delayed bone age
* Low levels of IGF1, IGF2, IGF binding protein 3
* Increased growth velocity after a few months of GH treatment

In childhood and adulthood, the diagnosing doctor will look for these features accompanied by corroboratory evidence of hypopituitarism such as deficiency of other pituitary hormones, a structurally abnormal pituitary, or a history of damage to the pituitary. This would confirm the diagnosis; in the absence of pituitary pathology, further testing would be required.

===Classification===
Growth hormone deficiency can be congenital or acquired in childhood or adult life. It can be partial or complete. It is usually permanent, but sometimes transient. It may be an isolated deficiency or occur in association with deficiencies of other pituitary hormones.

The term hypopituitarism is often used interchangeably with GH deficiency but more often denotes GH deficiency plus deficiency of at least one other anterior pituitary hormone. When GH deficiency (usually with other anterior pituitary deficiencies) is associated with posterior pituitary hormone deficiency (usually diabetes insipidus), the condition is termed panhypopituitarism.

==Treatment==

GH deficiency is treated by replacing GH with daily injections under the skin or into muscle. Until 1985, growth hormone for treatment was obtained by extraction from human pituitary glands collected at autopsy. Since 1985, recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH) is a recombinant form of human GH produced by genetically engineered bacteria, manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. In both children and adults, costs of treatment in terms of money, effort, and the impact on day-to-day life, are substantial.

===Child===
GH treatment is not recommended for children who are not growing despite having normal levels of growth hormone, and in the UK it is not licensed for this use. Children requiring treatment usually receive daily injections of growth hormone. Most pediatric endocrinologists monitor growth and adjust dose every 3‚Äì6 months and many of these visits involve blood tests and x-rays. Treatment is usually extended as long as the child is growing, and lifelong continuation may be recommended for those most severely deficient. Nearly painless insulin syringes, pen injectors, or a needle-free delivery system reduce the discomfort. Injection sites include the biceps, thigh, buttocks, and stomach. Injection sites should be rotated daily to avoid lipoatrophy. Treatment is expensive, costing as much as US$10,000 to $40,000 a year in the US.

===Adults===
GH supplementation is not recommended medically for the physiologic age-related decline in GH/IGF secretion. It may be appropriate in diagnosed adult-onset deficiency, where a weekly dose of approximately 25% of that given to children is given. Lower doses again are called for in the elderly to reduce the incidence of side effects and maintain age-dependent normal levels of IGF-1.

In many countries, including the UK, the majority view among endocrinologists is that the failure of treatment to provide any demonstrable, measurable benefits in terms of outcomes means treatment is not recommended for all adults with severe GHD, and national guidelines in the UK as set out by NICE suggest three criteria which all need to be met for treatment to be indicated:
# Severe GH deficiency, defined as a peak GH response of &lt;9mU/litre during an insulin tolerance test
# Perceived impairment of quality of life, as assessed by questionnaire
# They are already treated for other pituitary hormone disorders
Where treatment is indicated, duration is dependent upon indication.

Cost of adult treatment in the UK is 3000-4000 GBP annually.

===Side effects===
* Headaches
* Joint pain and muscle pain
* Fluid retention, and carpal tunnel syndrome
* Mild hypertension
* Visual problems
* Nausea and vomiting
* Paraesthesiae
* Antibody formation
* Reactions at the injection site
* Rarely, benign intracranial hypertension.

==Prognosis==

===Child===
When treated with GH, a severely deficient child will begin to grow faster within months. In the first year of treatment, the rate of growth may increase from half as fast as other children are growing to twice as fast (e.g., from 1¬†inch a year to 4¬†inches, or 2.5¬†cm to 10). Growth typically slows in subsequent years, but usually remains above normal so that over several years a child who had fallen far behind in their height may grow into the normal height range. Excess adipose tissue may be reduced.

===Adults===
GH treatment can confer a number of measurable benefits to severely GH-deficient adults, such as enhanced energy and strength, and improved bone density. Muscle mass may increase at the expense of adipose tissue. Although adults with hypopituitarism have been shown to have a reduced life expectancy, and a cardiovascular mortality rate of more than double controls, treatment has not been shown to improve mortality, although blood lipid levels do improve. Similarly, although measurements of bone density improve with treatment, rates of fractures have not been shown to improve.

Effects on quality of life are unproven, with a number of studies finding that adults with GHD had near-normal indicators of QoL at baseline (giving little scope for improvement), and many using outdated dosing strategies. However, it may be that those adults with poor QoL at the start of treatment do benefit.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of idiopathic GHD in infants is about 1 in every 3800 live births, and rates in older children are rising as more children survive childhood cancers which are treated with radiotherapy, although exact rates are hard to obtain. The incidence of genuine adult-onset GHD, normally due to pituitary tumours, is estimated at 10 per million.

==History==
Like many other 19th century medical terms which lost precise meaning as they gained wider currency, &quot;midget&quot; as a term for someone with severe proportional shortness acquired pejorative connotations and is no longer used in a medical context.

Notable modern pop cultural figures with growth hormone deficiency include actor and comedian Andy Milonakis, who has the appearance and voice of an adolescent boy despite being in his 40s. Argentine footballer Lionel Messi was diagnosed at age 10 with growth hormone deficiency and was subsequently treated. TLC reality star Shauna Rae was affected by a medically-caused growth hormone deficiency resulting from childhood glioblastoma cancer treatment. Oscar winning actress Linda Hunt was diagnosed as having this condition when a teenager.

<text>Family Plots is an American reality series that followed the events and employees at the family-run Poway Bernardo Mortuary in Poway, California. It ran for two years, beginning in 2004, on the A&amp;E Network.

==Overview==
The show centered on the relationships between the employees, in particular Chuck Wissmiller and his three daughters, all of whom worked together at the mortuary during the show&#x27;s run. Each episode featured one or two funerals with families who shared their grief while celebrating the life and contributions of their loved ones. The departed themselves were seen from time to time on the show. While the work done in the preparation room was also shown, the more graphic portions of mortuary work were limited.

The show was also aired on the Seven Network in Australia, in Canada, and Europe.

<text>Moses Wisner (June 3, 1815 ‚Äì January 5, 1863) was the 12th governor of Michigan, a Colonel during the Civil War, and an active supporter of the anti-slavery movement.

==Early life in New York==
Wisner was born in Springport, New York, descendant from a family from Switzerland which emigrated to America in the early 1700s and settled in Orange County, New York. His father was Moses Wisner, a Colonel during the War of 1812, while his brother, George Washington Wisner, was one of the early founders of &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper. One of Wisner&#x27;s distant relatives is Henry Wisner, delegate from New York to the Continental Congress and major participant against the British in the American Revolution.

He received an education in the common schools while working on his parents‚Äô farm. In 1837, he moved to Michigan and settled on a farm in Lapeer County. Two years later, he gave up on farming and moved to Pontiac, Michigan.

==Life and politics in Michigan==
He studied law while working at the law firm of his brother, George W. Wisner, and Rufus Hosmer. In 1841, he was admitted to the bar at Pontiac and then moved to the village of Lapeer, Michigan to begin to a practice. He was appointed prosecuting attorney for Lapeer County in 1843 by Governor William Woodbridge. He moved back to Pontiac to join a law firm there.

Wisner was not especially active in politics until after the election of U.S. President Franklin Pierce in 1852, when he became active in the anti-slavery movement. He was one of the foremost critics in Michigan of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 which repealed the Missouri Compromise and opened the territories to slavery. He participated in the first convention of the U.S. Republican Party in Jackson, Michigan in July, 1854 where he declined nomination as Michigan Attorney General. That same year he was an unsuccessful candidate from Michigan&#x27;s 4th congressional district to the U.S. House against Democrat George Washington Peck.

In 1858, Wisner was elected the 12th Governor of Michigan by a large majority and served one term from 1859 to 1861. After his term was over he returned to his home in Pontiac and resumed the practice of law.

==Death and legacy==
In September 1862 during the American Civil War, Wisner worked to raise the 22nd Michigan Infantry and was commissioned a colonel, but was stricken with typhoid fever while en route to the regiment&#x27;s deployment. He died at the age of 47 in a private home near Lexington, Kentucky, and left behind his wife, Angeolina Hascall, the daughter of General Charles C. Hascall, of Flint, Michigan, and four children.

Moses Wisner is interred at Oak Hill Cemetery in Pontiac.

Wisner&#x27;s Greek Revival-Style mansion in Pontiac, the Moses Wisner House, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This site is now part of the Pine Grove Historical Museum, which hosts occasional social gatherings including weddings and ice cream socials.

Wisner Township, Michigan, in Tuscola County is named after Moses Wisner. Wisner Stadium, a football stadium located in Pontiac, Michigan, is also named for Wisner.

<doc id="620890" wikidata="Q313376" url="?curid=620890" title="Albert Roussel">
<text>Albert Charles Paul Marie Roussel (; 5 April 1869 ‚Äì 23 August 1937) was a French composer. He spent seven years as a midshipman, turned to music as an adult, and became one of the most prominent French composers of the interwar period. His early works were strongly influenced by the Impressionism of Debussy and Ravel, while he later turned toward neoclassicism.

== Biography ==
Born in Tourcoing (Nord), Roussel&#x27;s earliest interest was not in music but mathematics. He spent time in the French Navy, and in 1889 and 1890, he served on the crew of the frigate &quot;Iphig√©nie&quot; and spent several years in southern Vietnam. These travels affected him artistically, as many of his musical works would reflect his interest in far-off, exotic places.

After resigning from the Navy in 1894, he began to study harmony in Roubaix, first with Julien Koszul (grandfather of composer Henri Dutilleux), who encouraged him to pursue his formation in Paris with Eug√®ne Gigout; Roussel then continued his studies until 1908 at the Schola Cantorum de Paris, where one of his teachers was Vincent d&#x27;Indy. While studying, Roussel also taught. His students included Erik Satie and Edgard Var√®se. ()

During World War I, Roussel served as an ambulance driver on the Western Front. Following the war, he bought a summer house in Normandy and devoted most of his time there to composition.

Starting in 1923, another of Roussel&#x27;s students was Bohuslav Martin≈Ø, who dedicated his &quot;Serenade for Chamber Orchestra&quot; (1930) to Roussel. French composer and musicologist Yvonne Rokseth also studied with Roussel.

His sixtieth birthday was marked by a series of three concerts of his works in Paris; the concerts also included the performance of a collection of piano pieces, &quot;Homage to Albert Roussel&quot;, written by several composers, including Ibert, Poulenc, and Honegger.

Roussel died in Royan, in 1937, and was buried in the churchyard of Saint Valery in Varengeville-sur-Mer.

== Compositions ==

By temperament Roussel was predominantly a classicist. While his early work was strongly influenced by Impressionism, he eventually arrived at a personal style which was more formal in design, with a strong rhythmic drive, and with a more distinct affinity for functional tonality than is found in the work of his more famous contemporaries Debussy, Ravel, Satie, and Stravinsky.

Roussel&#x27;s training at the Schola Cantorum, with its emphasis on rigorous academic models such as Palestrina and Bach, left its mark on his mature style, which is characterized by contrapuntal textures. On the whole Roussel&#x27;s orchestration is rather heavy compared to the subtle and nuanced style of other French composers like Debussy or, indeed, Gabriel Faur√©. He preserved something of the romantic aesthetic in his orchestral works, and this sets him apart from Stravinsky and Les Six.

He was also interested in jazz. This interest led to his writing a piano-vocal composition entitled &quot;Jazz dans la nuit&quot;, which was similar in its inspiration to other jazz-inspired works such as the second movement of Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Violin Sonata&quot;, or Milhaud&#x27;s &quot;La cr√©ation du monde&quot;.

Roussel&#x27;s most important works were the ballets &quot;Le festin de l&#x27;araign√©e&quot;, &quot;Bacchus et Ariane&quot;, and &quot;Aeneas&quot; and the four symphonies, of which the &quot;Third&quot; in G minor, and the &quot;Fourth&quot; in A major, are highly regarded and epitomize his mature neoclassical style. His other works include numerous ballets, orchestral suites, a piano concerto, a concertino for cello and orchestra, a psalm setting for chorus and orchestra, incidental music for the theatre, and much chamber music, solo piano music, and songs.

== Critical reception ==
In 1929, one French critic, Henry Pruni√®res, described Roussel&#x27;s search for his own voice:

Arturo Toscanini included the suite from the ballet &quot;Le festin de l&#x27;araign√©e&quot; in one of his broadcast concerts with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Rene Leibowitz recorded that suite in 1952 with the Paris Philharmonic, and Georges Pr√™tre recorded it with the &quot;Orchestre National de France&quot; for EMI in 1984.

One brief assessment of his career says:

One 21st-century critic, in the course of discussing the Third Symphony, wrote:

== The Albert Roussel Collection ==
The association &quot;Les Amis belges d&#x27;Albert Roussel&quot; (The Belgian Friends of Albert Roussel) was founded in 1979 by Andr√© Peeters. In 1986 the association donated a collection of Roussel-linked documents to the Music Division of the Royal Library of Belgium, thus creating the most important collection of archival sources on the composer outside of France. The collection contains many unique documents including a dozen musical manuscripts, autographs, around 250 letters (100 of them unpublished), a travel diary, recordings (including most of the early recordings of his compositions), iconography, a large collection of press clippings, programs and other documents linked to Roussel&#x27;s works and life.

<text>An exploitation film is a film that tries to succeed financially by exploiting current trends, niche genres, or lurid content. Exploitation films are generally low-quality &quot;B movies&quot;, though some set trends, attract critical attention, become historically important, and even gain a cult following.

==History==
Exploitation films often include themes such as suggestive or explicit sex, sensational violence, drug use, nudity, gore, destruction, rebellion, mayhem, and the bizarre. Such films were first seen in their modern form in the early 1920s, but they were popularized in the 60s and 70s with the general relaxing of censorship and cinematic taboos in the U.S. and Europe. An early example, the 1933 film &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, included nude scenes featuring the Austrian actress Hedy Lamarr. The film proved popular at the box office but caused concern for the American cinema trade association, the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA). The organisation, which applied the Hays Code for film censorship, also disapproved of the work of Dwain Esper, the director responsible for exploitation movies such as &quot;Marihuana&quot; (1936) and &quot;Maniac&quot; (1934).

The Motion Picture Association of America (and its predecessor, the MPPDA) cooperated with censorship boards and grassroots organizations in the hope of preserving the image of a &quot;clean&quot; Hollywood, but the distributors of exploitation film operated outside of this system and often welcomed controversy as a form of free promotion. Their producers used sensational elements to attract audiences lost to television. Since the 1990s, this genre has also received attention in academic circles, where it is sometimes called paracinema.

&quot;Exploitation&quot; is loosely defined and arguably has as much to do with the viewer&#x27;s perception of the film as with the film&#x27;s actual content. Titillating material and artistic content often co-exist, as demonstrated by the fact that art films that failed to pass the Hays Code were often shown in the same grindhouses as exploitation films. Exploitation films share the fearlessness of acclaimed transgressive European directors such as Derek Jarman, Luis Bu√±uel and Jean-Luc Godard in handling &quot;disreputable&quot; content. Many films recognized as classics contain levels of sex, violence and shock typically associated with exploitation films. Examples include Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, Tod Browning&#x27;s &quot;Freaks&quot; and Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Repulsion&quot;. Bu√±uel&#x27;s &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; contains elements of the modern splatter film. It has been suggested that if &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; had been made in Europe, it would be considered an art film, while if &quot;Eyes Without a Face&quot; had been made in the U.S., it would have been categorized as a low-budget horror film. The audiences of art and exploitation film are both considered to have tastes that reject the mainstream Hollywood offerings.

Exploitation films have often exploited news events in the short-term public consciousness that a major film studio may avoid because of the time required to produce a major film. &quot;Child Bride&quot; (1938), for example, tackled the issue of older men marrying young girls in the Ozarks. Other issues, such as drug use in films like &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; (1936), attracted audiences that major film studios would usually avoid to keep their respectable, mainstream reputations. With enough incentive, however, major studios might become involved, as Warner Bros. did in their 1969 anti-LSD, anti-counterculture film &quot;The Big Cube&quot;. The film &quot;Sex Madness&quot; (1938) portrayed the dangers of venereal disease from premarital sex. &quot;Mom and Dad&quot;, a 1945 film about pregnancy and childbirth, was promoted in lurid terms. &quot;She Shoulda Said No!&quot; (1949) combined the themes of drug use and promiscuous sex. In the early days of film, when exploitation films relied on such sensational subjects as these, they had to present a very conservative moral viewpoint to avoid censorship, as movies then were not considered to enjoy First Amendment protection.

Several war films were made about the Winter War in Finland, the Korean War and the Vietnam War before the major studios showed interest. When Orson Welles&#x27; radio production of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; from &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; for Halloween in 1938 shocked many Americans and made news, Universal Pictures edited their serial &quot;Flash Gordon&#x27;s Trip to Mars&quot; into a short feature called &quot;Mars Attacks the World&quot; for release in November of that year.

Some Poverty Row low-budget B movies often exploit major studio projects. Their rapid production schedule allows them to take advantage of publicity attached to major studio films. For example, Edward L. Alperson produced William Cameron Menzies&#x27; film &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot; to beat Paramount Pictures&#x27; production of director George Pal&#x27;s &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; to the cinemas, and Pal&#x27;s &quot;The Time Machine&quot; was beaten to the cinemas by Edgar G. Ulmer&#x27;s film &quot;Beyond the Time Barrier&quot;. As a result, many major studios, producers, and stars kept their projects secret.

==Grindhouses and drive-ins==
Grindhouse is an American term for a theater that mainly showed exploitation films. These theatres were most popular throughout the 1970s and early 1980s in New York City and other urban centers, mainly in North America, but began a long decline during the mid-1980s with the advent of home video.

As the drive-in movie theater began to decline in the 1960s and 1970s, theater owners began to look for ways to bring in patrons. One solution was to book lower cost exploitation films. Some producers from the 1950s to the 1980s made films directly for the drive-in market, and the commodity product needed for a weekly change led to another theory about the origin of the word: that the producers would &quot;grind&quot;-out films. Many of them were violent action films that some called &quot;drive-in&quot; films.

==Subgenres==
Exploitation films may adopt the subject matter and styling of regular film genres, particularly horror films and documentary films, and their themes are sometimes influenced by other so-called exploitative media, such as pulp magazines. They often blur the distinctions between genres by containing elements of two or more genres at a time. Their subgenres are identifiable by the characteristics they use. For example, Doris Wishman&#x27;s &quot;Let Me Die A Woman&quot; contains elements of both shock documentary and sexploitation.

===1930s and 1940s cautionary films===

Although they featured lurid subject matter, exploitation films of the 1930s and 1940s evaded the strict censorship and scrutiny of the era by claiming to be educational. They were generally cautionary tales about the alleged dangers of premarital sexual intercourse and the use of recreational drugs. Examples include &quot;Marihuana&quot; (1936), &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; (1936), &quot;Sex Madness&quot; (1938), &quot;Child Bride&quot; (1938), &quot;Mom and Dad&quot; (1945) and &quot;She Shoulda Said No!&quot; (1949). An exploitation film about homosexuality, &quot;Children of Loneliness&quot; (1937), is now believed lost.

===Biker films===

In 1953, &quot;The Wild One&quot;, starring Marlon Brando, was the first film about a motorcycle gang. A string of low-budget juvenile delinquent films featuring hot-rods and motorcycles followed in the 1950s. The success of American International Pictures&#x27; &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; in 1966 ignited a more robust trend that continued into the early 1970s. Other biker films include &quot;Motorpsycho&quot; (1965), &quot;Hells Angels on Wheels&quot; (1967), &quot;The Born Losers&quot; (1967), &quot;Wild Rebels&quot; (1967), &quot;Angels from Hell&quot; (1968), &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969), &quot;Satan&#x27;s Sadists&quot; (1969), &quot;Naked Angels&quot; (1969), &quot;Nam&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1970), and &quot;C.C. and Company&quot; (1970). &quot;Stone&quot; (1974)&quot;, and Mad Max&quot; (1979) combine elements of this subgenre with Ozploitation. In the 1960s, Roger Corman directed Edgar Allan Poe B horror movies with well-known horror veteran movie actors with Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre, Vincent Price and a young, unknown Jack Nicholson. He turned down directing &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, which was directed by Dennis Hopper.

===Blaxploitation===

Black exploitation films, or &quot;blaxploitation&quot; films, are made with black actors, ostensibly for black audiences, often in a stereotypically black American urban milieu. A prominent theme was black Americans overcoming hostile authority (&quot;The Man&quot;) through cunning and violence. The first examples of this subgenre were &quot;Shaft&quot; and Melvin Van Peebles&#x27; &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot;. Others are &quot;Black Caesar&quot;, &quot;Black Devil Doll&quot;, &quot;Blacula&quot;, &quot;Black Shampoo&quot;, &quot;Boss Nigger&quot;, &quot;Coffy&quot;, &quot;Coonskin&quot;, &quot;Cotton Comes to Harlem&quot;, &quot;Dolemite&quot;, &quot;Foxy Brown&quot;, &quot;Hell Up in Harlem&quot;, &quot;The Mack&quot;, &quot;Disco Godfather&quot;, &quot;Mandingo&quot;, &quot;The Spook Who Sat by the Door&quot;, &quot;Sugar Hill&quot;, &quot;Super Fly&quot;, &quot;T.N.T. Jackson&quot;, &quot;The Thing with Two Heads&quot;, &quot;Truck Turner&quot;, &quot;Willie Dynamite&quot; and &quot;Cleopatra Jones&quot;.

In blaxploitation horror movies back in the 1970s, despite the leading stars in those movies being black, some of these movies were either produced, edited, or directed by white filmmakers.¬†&quot;Blacula&quot;, a well-known blaxploitation horror movie, was directed by an African American filmmaker named William Crain.¬†&quot;Blacula&quot; was one of the first early successful blaxploitation horror movies. &quot;Ganja &amp; Hess&quot; stars Duane Jones, who played Ben in &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. This movie has political and social commentary in which the vampires are a metaphor for capitalism, according to Harry M. Benshoff.

Modern homages of this genre include &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, &quot;Pootie Tang&quot;, &quot;Undercover Brother&quot;, &quot;Black Dynamite&quot;, &quot;Proud Mary&quot; and &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot;. The 1973 Bond film &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; uses blaxploitation themes.

===Cannibal films===
Cannibal films are graphic movies from the early 1970s to the late 1980s, primarily made by Italian and Spanish moviemakers. They focus on cannibalism by tribes deep in the South American or Asian rainforests. This cannibalism is usually perpetrated against Westerners that the tribes held prisoner. As with mondo films, the main draw of cannibal films was the promise of exotic locales and graphic gore involving living creatures. The best-known film of this genre is the controversial 1980 &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;, in which six real animals were killed on screen. Others include &quot;Cannibal Ferox&quot;, &quot;Eaten Alive!&quot;, &quot;Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death&quot;, &quot;The Mountain of the Cannibal God&quot;, &quot;Last Cannibal World&quot; and the first film of the genre, &quot;The Man From Deep River&quot;. Famous directors in this genre include Umberto Lenzi, Ruggero Deodato, Jes√∫s Franco and Joe D&#x27;Amato.

&quot;The Green Inferno&quot; (2013) is a modern homage to the genre.

===Canuxploitation===
&quot;Canuxploitation&quot; is a neologism that was coined in 1999 by the magazine &quot;Broken Pencil&quot;, in the article &quot;Canuxploitation! Goin&#x27; Down the Road with the Cannibal Girls that Ate Black Christmas. Your Complete Guide to the Canadian B-Movie&quot;, to refer to Canadian-made B-movies. Most mainstream critical analysis of this period in Canadian film history, however, refers to it as the &quot;tax-shelter era&quot;.

The phenomenon emerged in 1974, when the government of Canada introduced new regulations to jumpstart the then-underdeveloped Canadian film industry, increasing the Capital Cost Allowance tax credit from 60 per cent to 100 per cent. While some important and noteworthy films were made under the program, including &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot; and &quot;Lies My Father Told Me&quot;, and some film directors who cut their teeth in the &quot;tax shelter&quot; era emerged as among Canada&#x27;s most important and influential filmmakers of the era, including David Cronenberg, William Fruet, Ivan Reitman and Bob Clark, the new regulations also had an entirely unforeseen side effect: a sudden rush of low-budget horror and genre films, intended as pure tax shelters since they were designed not to turn a conventional profit. Many of the films, in fact, were made by American filmmakers, whose projects had been rejected by the Hollywood studio system as not commercially viable, giving rise to the Hollywood North phenomenon. &quot;Variety&quot; dubbed the genre &quot;maple syrup porno&quot;.

Notable examples of the genre include &quot;Cannibal Girls&quot;, &quot;Deathdream&quot;, &quot;Deranged&quot;, &quot;The Corpse Eaters&quot;, &quot;Black Christmas&quot;, &quot;Shivers&quot;, &quot;Death Weekend&quot;, &quot;The Clown Murders&quot;, &quot;Rituals&quot;, &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Curse&quot;, &quot;Deadly Harvest&quot;, &quot;Starship Invasions&quot;, &quot;Rabid&quot;, &quot;I Miss You, Hugs and Kisses&quot;, &quot;The Brood&quot;, &quot;Funeral Home&quot;, &quot;Terror Train&quot;, &quot;The Changeling&quot;, &quot;Death Ship&quot;, &quot;My Bloody Valentine&quot;, &quot;Prom Night&quot;, &quot;Happy Birthday to Me&quot;, &quot;Scanners&quot;, &quot;Ghostkeeper&quot;, &quot;Visiting Hours&quot;, &quot;Highpoint&quot;, &quot;Humongous&quot;, &quot;Deadly Eyes&quot;, &quot;Class of 1984&quot;, &quot;Videodrome&quot;, &quot;Curtains&quot;, &quot;American Nightmare&quot;, &quot;Self Defense&quot;, &quot;Spasms&quot; and &quot;Def-Con 4&quot;.

The period officially ended in 1982, when the Capital Cost Allowance was reduced to 50 per cent, although films that had entered production under the program continued to be released for another few years afterward. However, at least one Canadian film blog extends the &quot;Canuxploitation&quot; term to refer to any Canadian horror, thriller or science fiction film made up to the present day.

=== Carsploitation ===
Carsploitation films feature scenes of cars racing and crashing, featuring the sports cars, muscle cars, and car wrecks that were popular in the 1970s and 1980s. They were produced mainly in the United States and Australia. The quintessential film of this genre is &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; (1971). Others include &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot; (1971), &quot;The Cars That Ate Paris&quot; (1974), &quot;Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry&quot; (1974), &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; (1974), &quot;Death Race 2000&quot; (1975), &quot;Race with the Devil&quot; (1975), &quot;Cannonball&quot; (1976), &quot;Mad Max&quot; (1979), &quot;Safari 3000&quot; (1982), &quot;Dead End Drive-In&quot; (1986) and &quot;Black Moon Rising&quot; (1986). Quentin Tarantino directed a tribute to the genre, &quot;Death Proof&quot; (2007).

===Chanbara films===
In the 1970s, a revisionist, non-traditional style of samurai film achieved some popularity in Japan. It became known as &quot;chambara&quot;, an onomatopoeia describing the clash of swords. Its origins can be traced as far back as Akira Kurosawa, whose films feature moral grayness and exaggerated violence, but the genre is mostly associated with 1970s samurai manga by Kazuo Koike, on whose work many later films would be based. Chambara features few of the stoic, formal sensibilities of earlier &quot;jidaigeki&quot; films ‚Äì the new &quot;chambara&quot; featured revenge-driven antihero protagonists, nudity, sex scenes, swordplay and blood.

===Giallo films===

Giallo films are Italian-made slasher films that focus on cruel murders and the subsequent search for the killers. They are named for the Italian word for yellow, &quot;giallo&quot;, the background color featured on the covers of the pulp novels by which these movies were inspired. The progenitor of this genre was &quot;The Girl Who Knew Too Much&quot;. Other examples of Giallo films include &quot;Four Flies on Grey Velvet&quot;, &quot;Deep Red&quot;, &quot;The Cat o&#x27; Nine Tails&quot;, &quot;The Bird with the Crystal Plumage&quot;, &quot;The Case of the Scorpion&#x27;s Tail&quot;, &quot;A Lizard in a Woman&#x27;s Skin&quot;, &quot;Black Belly of the Tarantula&quot;, &quot;The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh&quot;, &quot;Blood and Black Lace&quot;, &quot;Phenomena&quot;, &quot;Opera&quot; and &quot;Tenebrae&quot;. Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci and Mario Bava are the best-known directors of this genre.

The 2013 Argentinian film &quot;Sonno Profondo&quot; is a modern tribute to the genre.

===Mockbusters===

Mockbusters, sometimes called &quot;remakesploitation films&quot;, are copycat movies that try to cash in on the advertising of heavily promoted films from major studios. Production company the Asylum, which prefers to call them &quot;tie-ins&quot;, is a prominent producer of these films. Such films have often come from Italy, which has been quick to latch on to trends like Westerns, James Bond movies, and zombie films. They have long been a staple of directors such as Jim Wynorski (&quot;The Bare Wench Project&quot;, and the &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; imitation &quot;Sub Zero&quot;), who make movies for the direct-to-video market. Such films are beginning to attract attention from major Hollywood studios, who served the Asylum with a cease and desist order to try to prevent them from releasing &quot;The Day the Earth Stopped&quot; to video stores in advance of the release of &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; to theaters.

The term &quot;mockbuster&quot; was used as early as the 1950s (when &quot;The Monster of Piedras Blancas&quot; was a clear derivative of &quot;Creature From The Black Lagoon&quot;). The term did not become popular until the 1970s, with &quot;Starcrash&quot; and the Turkish &quot;D√ºnyayƒ± Kurtaran Adam&quot; and &quot;S√ºpermen d√∂n√ºyor&quot;. The latter two used scenes from &quot;Star Wars&quot; and unauthorized excerpts from John Williams&#x27; score.

===Mondo films===

Mondo films, often called shockumentaries, are quasi-documentary films about sensationalized topics like exotic customs from around the world or gruesome death footage. The goal of mondo films, as of shock exploitation, is to shock the audience by dealing with taboo subject matter. The first mondo film is &quot;Mondo Cane&quot; (&quot;A Dog&#x27;s World&quot;). Others include &quot;Shocking Asia&quot;, &quot;Africa Addio&quot; (aka &quot;Africa Blood and Guts&quot; and &quot;Farewell Africa&quot;), &quot;Goodbye Uncle Tom&quot; and &quot;Faces of Death&quot;.

===Monster movies===
These &quot;nature-run-amok&quot; films focus on an animal or group of animals, far larger and more aggressive than usual for their species, terrorizing humans while another group of humans tries to fight back. This genre began in the 1950s, when concern over nuclear weapons testing made movies about giant monsters popular. These were typically either giant prehistoric creatures awakened by atomic explosions or ordinary animals mutated by radiation. Among them were &quot;Godzilla&quot;, &quot;Them!&quot; and &quot;Tarantula&quot;. The trend was revived in the 1970s as awareness of pollution increased and corporate greed and military irresponsibility were blamed for destruction of the environment. &quot;Night of the Lepus&quot;, &quot;Frogs&quot;, and &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot; are examples. After Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Jaws&quot;, a number of very similar films (sometimes regarded as outright rip-offs) were produced in the hope of cashing in on its success. Examples are &quot;Alligator&quot;, &quot;Cujo&quot;, &quot;Day of the Animals&quot;, &quot;Great White&quot;, &quot;Grizzly&quot;, &quot;Humanoids from the Deep&quot;, &quot;Monster Shark&quot;, &quot;Orca&quot;, &quot;The Pack&quot;, &quot;Piranha&quot;, &quot;Prophecy&quot;, &quot;Razorback&quot;, &quot;Blood Feast&quot;, &quot;Tentacles&quot; and &quot;Tintorera&quot;. Roger Corman was a major producer of these films in both decades. The genre has experienced a revival in recent years, as films like &quot;Mulberry Street&quot; and Larry Fessenden&#x27;s &quot;The Last Winter&quot; reflected concerns about global warming and overpopulation.

The Sci-Fi Channel (now known as SyFy) has produced several films about giant or hybrid mutations whose titles are sensationalized portmanteaus of the two species; examples include &quot;Sharktopus&quot; and &quot;Dinoshark&quot;.

===Nazisploitation===
Nazi exploitation films, also called &quot;Nazisploitation&quot; films, or &quot;il sadiconazista&quot;, focus on Nazis torturing prisoners in death camps and brothels during World War II. The tortures are often sexual, and the prisoners, who are often female, are nude. The progenitor of this subgenre was &quot;Love Camp 7&quot; (1969). The archetype of the genre, which established its popularity and its typical themes, was &quot;Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS&quot; (1974), about the buxom, nymphomaniacal dominatrix Ilsa torturing prisoners in a Stalag. Others include &quot;Fr√§ulein Devil&quot; (&quot;Captive Women 4&quot;, or &quot;Elsa: Fraulein SS&quot;, or &quot;Fraulein Kitty&quot;), &quot;La Bestia in calore&quot; (&quot;SS Hell Camp&quot;, or &quot;SS Experiment Part 2&quot;, or &quot;The Beast in Heat&quot;, or &quot;Horrifying Experiments of the S.S. Last Days&quot;), &quot;Gestapo&#x27;s Last Orgy&quot;, or &quot;Last Orgy of The Third Reich&quot;, or &quot;Caligula Reincarnated as Hitler&quot;, &quot;Salon Kitty&quot; and &quot;SS Experiment Camp&quot;. Many Nazisploitation films were influenced by art films such as Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s infamous &quot;Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom&quot; and Liliana Cavani&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Night Porter&quot;).

===Nudist films===
Nudist films originated in the 1930s as films that skirted the Hays Code restrictions on nudity by purportedly depicting the naturist lifestyle. They existed through the late 1950s, when the New York State Court of Appeals ruled in the case of &quot;Excelsior Pictures vs. New York Board of Regents&quot; that onscreen nudity is not obscene. This opened the door to more open depictions of nudity, starting with Russ Meyer&#x27;s 1959 &quot;The Immoral Mr. Teas&quot;, which has been credited as the first film to place its exploitation elements unapologetically at the forefront instead of pretending to carry a moral or educational message. This development paved the way for the more explicit exploitation films of the 1960s and 1970s and made the nudist genre obsolete‚Äîironically, since the nudist film &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; was the subject of the court case. After this, the nudist genre split into subgenres such as the &quot;nudie-cutie&quot;, which featured nudity but no touching, and the &quot;roughie&quot;, which included nudity and violent, antisocial behavior.

Nudist films were marked by self-contradictory qualities. They presented themselves as educational films, but exploited their subject matter by focusing mainly on the nudist camps&#x27; most beautiful female residents, while denying the existence of such exploitation. They depicted a lifestyle unbound by the restrictions of clothing, yet this depiction was restricted by the requirement that genitals should not be shown. Still, there was a subversive element to them, as the nudist camps inherently rejected modern society and its values regarding the human body. These films frequently involve a criticism of the class system, equating body shame with the upper class, and nudism with social equality. One scene in &quot;The Unashamed&quot; makes a point about the artificiality of clothing and its related values through a mocking portrayal of a group of nude artists who paint fully clothed subjects.

===Ozploitation===
The term &quot;Ozploitation&quot; refers broadly to Australian horror, erotic or crime films of the 1970s and 1980s. Changes to Australia&#x27;s film classification system in 1971 led to the production of a number of such low-budget, privately funded films, assisted by tax exemptions and targeting export markets. Often an internationally recognised actor (but of waning notability) would be hired to play a lead role. Laconic characters and desert scenes feature in many Ozploitation films, but the term has been used for a variety of Australian films of the era that relied on shocking or titillating their audiences. A documentary about the genre was &quot;Not Quite Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation!&quot;. Such films deal with themes concerning Australian society, particularly in respect of masculinity (especially the ocker male), male attitudes towards women, attitudes towards and treatment of Indigenous Australians, violence, alcohol and environmental exploitation and destruction. The films typically have rural or outback settings, depicting the Australian landscape and environment as an almost spiritually malign force that alienates white Australians, frustrating their personal ambitions and activities, and their attempts to subdue it.

Notable examples include &quot;Mad Max&quot;, &quot;Alvin Purple&quot;, &quot;Patrick&quot; and &quot;Turkey Shoot&quot;.

===Rape and revenge films===
This genre contains films in which a person is raped, left for dead, recovers and then exacts a graphic, gory revenge against the rapists. The most famous example is &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; (also called &quot;Day of the Woman&quot;). It is not unusual for the main character in these films to be a successful, independent city woman, who is attacked by a man from the country. The genre has drawn praise from feminists such as Carol J. Clover, whose 1992 book &quot;Men, Women, and Chainsaws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film&quot; examines the implications of its reversals of cinema&#x27;s traditional gender roles. This type of film can be seen as an offshoot of the vigilante film, with the victim&#x27;s transformation into avenger as the key scene. Author Jacinda Read and others believe that rape‚Äìrevenge should be categorized as a narrative structure rather than a true subgenre, because its plot can be found in films of many different genres, such as thrillers (&quot;Ms. 45&quot;), dramas (&quot;Lipstick&quot;), westerns (&quot;Hannie Caulder&quot;) and art films (&quot;Memento&quot;). One instance of the genre, the original version of &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot;, was an uncredited remake of Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;The Virgin Spring&quot;, recast as a horror film featuring extreme violence. &quot;Deliverance&quot;, in which the rape is perpetrated on a man, has been credited as the originator of the genre. Clover, who restricts her definition of the genre to movies in which a woman is raped and gains her own revenge, praises rape‚Äìrevenge exploitation films for the way in which their protagonists fight their abuse directly, rather than preserve the status quo by depending on an unresponsive legal system, as in rape‚Äìrevenge movies from major studios such as &quot;The Accused&quot;. 
 has been identified as an inspiration of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s for his Kill Bill movies.

===Redsploitation===

The redsploitation genre concerns Native American characters almost always played by white actors, usually exacting their revenge on their white tormentors. Examples are the &quot;Billy Jack&quot; tetralogy, &quot;The Ransom&quot;, the &quot;Thunder Warrior&quot; trilogy, &quot;Johnny Firecloud&quot;, &quot;Angry Joe Bass&quot;, &quot;The Manitou&quot;, &quot;Prophecy&quot;, &quot;Avenged&quot; (aka &quot;Savaged&quot;), &quot;Scalps,&quot; &quot;Clearcut and The Ghost Dance&quot;.

===Sexploitation===
Sexploitation films resemble softcore pornography and often include scenes involving nude or semi-nude women. They typically have sex scenes that are more graphic sex than mainstream films. The plots of sexploitation films include pulp fiction elements such as killers, slavery, female domination, martial arts, the use of stylistic devices and dialogue associated with screwball comedies, love interests and flirtation akin to romance films, over-the-top direction, cheeky homages, fan-pleasing content and caricatures, and performances that contain sleazy teasing alluding to foreplay or kink. The use of extended scenes and the showing of full frontal nudity are typical genre techniques. Sexploitation films include &quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; and &quot;Supervixens&quot; by Russ Meyer, the work of Armando B√≥ with Isabel Sarli, the &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; series, &quot;Showgirls&quot; and &quot;Caligula&quot;. &quot;Caligula&quot; is unusual among exploitation films in that it was made with a large budget and well-known actors (Malcolm McDowell, John Gielgud, Peter O&#x27;Toole and Helen Mirren).

Lesbian sex scenes of the 1970s have been studied in the context of the political and social implications of lesbianism and women&#x27;s sexuality, something that remains a topic of discourse for feminist film critics.¬†Some critics have said that lesbian sex on screen is an expression of chauvinism and male power as the images are portrayed for male pleasure.¬†

The casting of pornstars and hardcore actresses in sexploitation films is not uncommon. The films sometimes contain sex shows intended to shock or arouse their audiences.

===Slasher films===

Slasher films focus on a serial killer stalking and violently killing a sequence of victims. Victims are often teenagers or young adults. Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho (1960)&quot; is often credited with creating the basic premise of the genre, though Bob Clark&#x27;s &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (1974) is usually considered to have started the genre while John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978) was responsible for cementing the genre in the public eye. &quot;Halloween&quot; is also responsible for establishing additional tropes which would go on to define the genre in years to come. The masked villain, a central group of weak teenagers with one strong hero or heroine, the protagonists being isolated or stranded in precarious locations or situations, and either the protagonists or antagonists (or possibly both) experiencing warped family lives or values were all tropes largely founded in &quot;Halloween&quot;. John Carpenter was inspired by Bob Clark&#x27;s &quot;Black Christmas&quot;.

The genre continued into and peaked in the 1980s with well-known films like &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (1980) and &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984). Many 1980s slasher films used the basic format of &quot;Halloween&quot;, for example &quot;My Bloody Valentine&quot; (1981), &quot;Prom Night&quot; (1980), &quot;The Funhouse&quot; (1981), &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night&quot; (1984) and &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; (1983), many of which also used elements from &quot;Black Christmas&quot;. This genre was parodied/critiqued in Joss Whedon‚Äôs &quot;The Cabin in the Woods&quot; (2011).

===Spacesploitation===
A subtype featuring space, science fiction and horror in film. Despite ambitious literary works that depicted space travel as a component of more complex plots set in elaborately constructed civilizations (such as the Frank Herbert‚Äôs &quot;Dune&quot; series and the works of Isaac Asimov), for much of the 20th century space travel has been mostly featured in cheap &quot;B films&quot; that often had in their core a simplistic plot typical of another exploitation subgenre, such as slasher or zombie films. Spacesploration films feature a scientifically inaccurate and inconsistent depiction of space travel and are usually set in traversing spaceships and deserted planets, partially due to the films‚Äô limited resources. Such films include &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, &quot;Robinson Crusoe on Mars&quot;, &quot;Planet of the Vampires&quot;, &quot;The Black Hole&quot; and &quot;Saturn 3&quot;. During one of the peaks of space travel films, the 1979 James Bond film &quot;Moonraker&quot; featured outlandishly unrealistic scenes of space warfare, despite otherwise focusing on real contemporary (i.e. Cold War) intelligence agencies.

===Spaghetti Westerns===
Spaghetti Westerns are Italian-made westerns that emerged in the mid-1960s. They were more violent and amoral than typical Hollywood westerns. These films also often eschewed the conventions of Hollywood studio Westerns, which were primarily for consumption by conservative, mainstream American audiences.

Examples of the genre include &quot;Death Rides a Horse&quot;; &quot;Django&quot;; &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;; &quot;Navajo Joe&quot;; &quot;The Grand Duel&quot;; &quot;The Great Silence&quot;; &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;; &quot;The Big Gundown&quot;; &quot;Day of Anger&quot;; &quot;Face to Face&quot;; &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot;; &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;. Quentin Tarantino directed two tributes to the genre, &quot;Django Unchained&quot; and &quot;The Hateful Eight.&quot;

===Splatter films===


A splatter film, or gore film, is a horror film that focuses on graphic portrayals of gore and violence. It began as a distinct genre in the 1960s with the films of Herschell Gordon Lewis and David F. Friedman, whose most famous films include &quot;Blood Feast&quot; (1963), &quot;Two Thousand Maniacs!&quot; (1964), &quot;Color Me Blood Red&quot; (1965), &quot;The Gruesome Twosome&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Wizard of Gore&quot; (1970).

The first splatter film to popularize the subgenre was George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (1968), the director&#x27;s attempt to replicate the atmosphere and gore of EC&#x27;s horror comics on film. Initially derided by the American press as &quot;appalling&quot;, it quickly became a national sensation, playing not just in drive-ins but at midnight showings in indoor theaters across the country. George A. Romero coined the term &quot;splatter cinema&quot; to describe his film &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;.

Later splatter films, such as Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Evil Dead&quot; series, Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad Taste&quot; and &quot;Braindead&quot; (released as &quot;Dead Alive&quot; in North America) featured such excessive and unrealistic gore that they crossed the line from horror to comedy.

===Vansploitation===
=== Vetsploitation films ===
Vetsploitation films are mostly B-movies featuring veterans returning from war (especially the Vietnam War), often suffering from PTSD, who are misunderstood, vilified, turned into antiheroes, or go on a rampage of revenge. This subgenre is often the core plot of productions that also belong to other genres or subgenres, such as war, action, drama, thrillers, etc., and even horror films.

Well-known films of this subgenre are &quot;Welcome Home Soldier Boys&quot; (1972), &quot;The No Mercy Man&quot; (1973), &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; (1977), &quot;Cannibal Apocalypse&quot; (1980), and &quot;Thou Shalt Not Kill... Except&quot; (1985). Other films also considered as vetsploitation are &quot;Motorpsycho&quot; (1965), &quot;The Born Losers&quot; (1967), its sequel &quot;Billy Jack&quot; (1971), &quot;Vigilante Force&quot; (1976), &quot;The Zebra Force&quot; (1976), &quot;Born for Hell&quot; (1976), &quot;The Exterminator&quot; (1980), &quot;Don&#x27;t Answer the Phone!&quot; (1980), and &quot;Combat Shock&quot; (1986).

Although mostly associated with 1970s films dealing with the experience of Vietnam veterans and how they were perceived by society, there are films considered as vetsploitation shot in other times and involving other conflicts, such as World War II, like &quot;The Farmer&quot; (1977), or the Iraq war, like &quot;Red White &amp; Blue&quot; (2010).

Typical vetsploitation films are B-movies, however, some mainstream Hollywood films have been considered as representative of the subgenre, like &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982), &quot;Missing in Action&quot; (1984), and even art house films like &quot;Americana&quot; (1981), or &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; (1990).

===Women in prison films===
Women in prison films emerged in the early 1970s and remain a popular subgenre. They usually contain nudity, lesbianism, sexual assault, humiliation, sadism, and rebellion among captive women. Examples are Roger Corman&#x27;s &quot;Women in Cages&quot; and &quot;The Big Doll House&quot;, &quot;Bamboo House of Dolls&quot;, Jesus Franco&#x27;s &quot;Barbed Wire Dolls&quot;, Bruno Mattei&#x27;s &quot;Women&#x27;s Prison Massacre&quot;, Pete Walker&#x27;s &quot;House of Whipcord&quot;, Tom DeSimone&#x27;s &quot;Reform School Girls&quot;, Jonathan Demme&#x27;s &quot;Caged Heat&quot; and Katja von Garnier&#x27;s &quot;Bandits&quot;.

===Zombie films===

Victor Halperin&#x27;s &quot;White Zombie&quot; was released in 1932 and is often cited as the first zombie film.

Inspired by the zombie of Haitian folklore, the modern zombie emerged in popular culture during the latter half of the twentieth century, with George A. Romero&#x27;s seminal film &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (1968). The film received a sequel, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (1978), which was the most commercially successful zombie film at the time. It received another sequel, &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; (1985), and inspired numerous works such as &quot;Zombi 2&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Return of the Living Dead&quot; (1985). However, zombie films that followed in the 1980s and 1990s were not as commercially successful as &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; in the late 1970s.

In the 1980s Hong Kong cinema, the Chinese , a zombie-like creature dating back to Qing dynasty era fiction of the 18th and 19th centuries, was featured in a wave of films, popularised by &quot;Mr. Vampire&quot; (1985). Hong Kong films became popular in the Far East during the mid-1980s to early 1990s. Another American zombie film, &quot;The Serpent and the Rainbow&quot;, was released in 1988.

A zombie revival later began in the Far East during the late 1990s, inspired by the 1996 Japanese zombie video games &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;The House of the Dead&quot;, which led to a wave of low-budget Asian zombie films, such as the Hong Kong zombie comedy film &quot;Bio Zombie&quot; (1998) and Japanese zombie-action film &quot;Versus&quot; (2000). The zombie film revival later went global, as the worldwide success of zombie games such as &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; inspired a new wave of Western zombie films in the early 2000s, including the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film series, the British film &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (2002) and its sequel &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; (2007), &quot;House of the Dead&quot; (2003), a 2004 &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; remake and the British parody movie &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2004). The success of these films led to the zombie genre reaching a new peak of commercial success not seen since the 1970s.

Zombie films created in the 2000s have featured zombies that are more agile, vicious, intelligent, and stronger than the traditional zombie. These new fast running zombies have origins in video games, including &quot;Resident Evil&quot;‚Ä≥s running zombie dogs and particularly &quot;The House of the Dead&quot;‚Ä≥s running human zombies.

In the late 2010s, zombie films began declining in the Western world. In Japan, on the other hand, the low-budget Japanese zombie comedy &quot;One Cut of the Dead&quot; (2017) became a sleeper hit, making box office history by earning over a thousand times its budget.

===Minor subgenres===
* Actionploitation: Parody of 70s and 80s action films, usually a high-octane power fantasy that features macho pride, low-brow humor, cringe humor, bumbling and screwball buddy cops, martial arts, western boxing or street fighting, exaggerated rapport and/or bonding between villain and protagonist, intermittent melodrama and romance, plot elements that may be dropped and picked up again at random times to emphasize protagonist or villain&#x27;s brilliant planning and concludes with a drawn out final fight sequence. Films such as &quot;Megaforce&quot;, &quot;Full Contact&quot;, &quot;Crank&quot;, &quot;Samurai Cop 2&quot; and &quot;Kung Fury&quot; are examples of actionsploitation on both small screen and big screen.
* Bantusploitation: The exploitation films of Nigeria (Nollywood), Ghana (Ghallywood) and West Africa.
* Britsploitation: exploitation films set in Great Britain, sometimes in homage to the Hammer Horror range of films. Examples are &quot;The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue&quot; (1974) and the Academy Award winning American film &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (1981).
* Bruceploitation: films profiting from the death of Bruce Lee, with look-alike actors who often took similar names, like Bruce Li and Bruce Le. Examples include &quot;Enter Three Dragons&quot; and &quot;Re-Enter the Dragon&quot;. Another example is New Fist of Fury, which starred Jackie Chan before he became known for his &quot;slapstick&quot; fighting style.
* Category III films: Hong Kongese films aimed at audiences 18 years or older, named after the age certificates they would receive in Hong Kong. These films are estimated to make up 25% of Hong Kong&#x27;s film industry, and as in exploitation film itself, every genre of filmmaking is represented. Films made in the west, such as &quot;Wild Things&quot; and &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, often receive the Category III rating. Category III films are grouped into three classes based on censorship criteria: &quot;quasi-pornographic&quot; softcore pornography such as &quot;Sex and Zen&quot;, &quot;genre films&quot; that present adult-oriented versions of every genre of Hong Kong filmmaking, and &quot;pornoviolence&quot; films such as &quot;The Untold Story&quot;, which depict sexual violence and are often based on actual police cases.
* Chopsocky: Martial arts kung fu movies made primarily in Hong Kong and Taiwan during the 1960s and 1970s, such as &quot;Hand of Death&quot;, &quot;Master of the Flying Guillotine&quot;, &quot;Five Deadly Venoms&quot; and &quot;Legend of Shaolin Temple&quot;.
* Christploitation: Exploitation films with overtly Christian themes. Whereas films such as &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; and &quot;The Gospel According to St. Matthew&quot; are serious, thoughtful examinations of faith and spirituality, the Christploitation film delivers through condescension and heavy-handed delivery, the purpose of which is to make the non-Christian viewer feel guilty for not converting to Christianity. Christploitation films have existed for many decades, but only recently have achieved wider viewership. Independently produced Mormon-themed films &quot;All Faces West&quot; (1929) and &quot;&quot; (1931) were exploited for their expected appeal to LDS patrons. An early American example, &quot;The Lawton Story&quot; (1949) (aka &quot;Prince of Peace&quot;) was given an exploitation release by its producer Kroger Babb. Modern examples include &quot;God&#x27;s Not Dead&quot;, the Nicolas Cage remake of &quot;Left Behind&quot;, &quot;Unplanned&quot;, and &quot;Last Ounce of Courage&quot;.
* Deepsploitation: Between 1989 and 1990, numerous films with similar plots were released. All films show an underwater crew that has to fight with sea monsters in the deep ocean. &quot;Deep Star Six&quot;, &quot;Leviathan&quot;, &quot;The Abyss&quot;, &quot;The Evil Below&quot; and &quot;Lords of the Deep&quot; were released in 1989, and &quot;The Rift&quot; was released in 1990. While most of these films are low-budget, some are big productions like &quot;The Abyss&quot;.
* Gothsploitation: A small number of films generally from the year 2000 onwards featuring members of the Alternative or Goth subcultures of the UK, usually London, such as &quot;Learning Hebrew: A Gothsploitation Movie&quot; showing situations such as drug use, unusual sexual practises and wild parties, often with a heavily intellectual plot.
*Hicksploitation: an exploitation film subgenre based on stereotypes of the people and culture of the Southern United States. Examples of this subgenre include &quot;Child Bride&quot;, &quot;Deliverance&quot;, &quot;Two Thousand Maniacs!&quot;, and &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;.
* Hippie exploitation: 1960s films about the hippie counterculture, showing stereotypical situations such as marijuana and LSD use, sex, and wild psychedelic parties. Further examples are &quot;The Love-Ins&quot;, &quot;Psych-Out&quot;, &quot;The Trip&quot; (1967), and &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot;.
* Martial arts films: action films or historical dramas that are characterized by extensive fighting scenes employing martial arts. The genre was originally associated with Asia but gained international popularity owing to Bruce Lee. Examples include &quot;The Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;Sister Street Fighter&quot; series, and the Bruce Lee films &quot;The Big Boss&quot;, &quot;Fist of Fury&quot;, &quot;Way of the Dragon&quot;, and &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;.
* Mexican sex comedy: the Mexican sex comedies film genre, generally known as &quot;ficheras&quot; film, is a genre of sexploitation films that were produced and distributed in Mexico between the middle 1970s and the late 1980s. They were characterized by the language game called &quot;albures&quot; (comparable to &quot;playing the dozens&quot; in English), and their sexual tone was considered &quot;risque,&quot; though they weren&#x27;t always particularly explicit.
* Mexploitation: films exaggerating Mexican culture and portrayals of Mexican underworld, often dealing with crime, drug trafficking, money and sex. Hugo Stiglitz is a famous Mexican actor of this genre, as are Mario and Fernando Almada, brothers who made hundreds of movies on the same theme.
* Ninja films: these are a subgenre of martial arts films that center on the historically inaccurate stereotype of the ninja&#x27;s costume and arsenal of weapons, often including fantasy elements such as ninja magic. Many such movies were produced by splicing stock ninja fight footage with footage from unrelated film projects.
* Nunsploitation: films featuring nuns in dangerous or erotic situations, such as &quot;The Devils&quot;, &quot;Killer Nun&quot;, &quot;School of the Holy Beast&quot;, &quot;The Sinful Nuns of Saint Valentine&quot;, and &quot;Nude Nuns with Big Guns&quot;.
* Pinku eiga (pink films): Japanese sexploitation films popular throughout the 70s, often featuring softcore sex, rape, torture, BDSM and other unconventional sexual subjects.
* Pornochanchada: Brazilian na√Øve softcore pornographic films produced mostly in the 1970s.
* Queersploitation: A genre of exploitation film that deals with queer or LGBT people. 
* Rumberas film: Musical film genre that flourished in the called &quot;Golden Age of Mexican cinema&quot; in the 1940s and 1950s, and whose plots were developed mainly in tropical environments and the cabaret. His main stars were the actresses and dancers known as &quot;Rumberas&quot; (Afro-Caribbean rhythms dancers).
* Sharksploitation films: a subgenre about sharks. The most popular film in this genre is &quot;Jaws&quot;, and the subsequent Jaws (franchise) but many other films have been released. The sharksploitation films &quot;Sharknado&quot;, &quot;The Shallows&quot;, &quot;Bait 3D&quot;, &quot;The Reef&quot;, &quot;Shark Night&quot;, &quot;The Meg&quot;, &quot;Mega Shark Versus Crocosaurus&quot; and its sequels, &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;, &amp; &quot;Open Water&quot; are all examples of recent films in this genre. Sharksploitation films have been accused of spreading misinformation about sharks causing inflated fear of the animal, contributing to the worldwide decline of sharks.
* Stoner film or Stonersploitation: a subgenre that features the explicit use of marijuana, typically in a comical and positive light. Cheech &amp; Chong collaborations are a good example; a more recent series in this genre is Harold &amp; Kumar. Other movies in this genre include: &quot;Pineapple Express&quot;, &quot;Knocked Up&quot;, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, &quot;Half Baked&quot;, &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?&quot;, &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, &quot;Super Troopers&quot;, &quot;Booksmart&quot;, &quot;Get Him to the Greek&quot; with stoner slashers such as the &quot;Evil Bong&quot; series franchise, &quot;Pot Zombies&quot;, &quot;Evil Bong&quot;, &quot;Halloweed&quot;, &quot;Hansel &amp; Gretel Get Baked&quot; and &quot;4/20 Massacre&quot;.
* Swimsploitation: a subgenre of the sports film genre which focuses on water sports. An early example includes Bathing Beauty, the acclaimed documentaries &quot;The Endless Summer&quot; and &quot;Big River Man&quot;.
* Teensploitation: the exploitation of teenagers by the producers of teen-oriented films, with plots involving drugs, sex, alcohol and crime. The word &quot;teensploitation&quot; first appeared in a show business publication in 1982 and was included in &quot;Merriam Webster&#x27;s Collegiate Dictionary&quot; for the first time in 2004. &quot;River&#x27;s Edge&quot;, inspired by the murder of Marcy Renee Conrad, is a highly acclaimed instance, featuring early performances by Crispin Glover and Keanu Reeves and a cameo appearance by Dennis Hopper. The Larry Clark films &quot;Bully&quot;, &quot;Ken Park&quot; and &quot;Kids&quot; are well-known teensploitation films. American International Pictures made films for the teenage market from the 1950s on. &quot;The Pom Pom Girls&quot; was the inspiration behind slasher horror films and &quot;The Beatniks&quot; is a film with &quot;familiar tropes found in straight-up 1950s juvenile delinquency teensploitation.&quot; The depictions of American teens, female relationships and free-flowing narrative, topics are featured like dating, sex, hanging out, disobedience, etc., of &quot;Halloween and The Pom Pom Girls became standard elements of the slasher film.&quot; Teensploitation films, an era of teen sex comedies from the 80s, featuring gratuitous nudity. Some of the films are: &quot;The Last American Virgin&quot;, &quot;Private Lessons&quot; (1981), &quot;Animal House&quot; (1978), &quot;Heaven Help Us&quot; (1985), &quot;Spring Break&quot; (1983), &quot;Hot Resort&quot; (1985), &quot;Porkys&quot;, &quot;Surf II&quot;, &quot;Meatballs&quot; (1979), &quot;Summer Camp&quot; (1979), &quot;King Frat&quot; (1979), &quot;Private School&quot; (1983), &quot;Screwballs&quot; (1983), and &quot;Loose Screws&quot; (1985). The teen-adjacent sexploitation genre was born out of teensploitation, B-movie director Roger Corman was inspired to make many films about sexy teachers, sexy nurses, and many more. &quot;The Stewardesses&quot; (1969), &quot;Swedish Fly Girls&quot; (1971), &quot;The Swinging Stewardesses&quot; (1971), &quot;The Swinging Cheerleaders&quot; (1974), &quot;Fly Me&quot; (1973), &quot;Flying Acquaintances&quot; (1973), &quot;The Naughty Stewardesses&quot; (1975), &quot;Blazing Stewardesses&quot; (1975), &quot;Stewardess School&quot; (1986), &quot;The Bikini Carwash Company&quot; (1992) and &quot;Party Plane&quot; (1991). Lesser known are &quot;Computer Beach Party&quot; and &quot;&quot;.
* Fratsploitation/Sratsploitation/Greeksploitation: films focusing on the exploits of College life particularly the Greek life of fraternities and sororities centering around sex, drugs and alcohol before a serial killer rampages through the cast ending with the final girl defeating the killer and usually disowning her sorority. Examples include: &quot;The House on Sorority Row&quot; (1982), &quot;Sorority House Massacre&quot; (1986), &quot;Sorority Row&quot; (2009), &quot;Sorority Party Massacre&quot; (2012), &quot;Sorority Murder&quot; (2015) and &quot;Slotherhouse&quot; (2023).
* Turksploitation: Turksploitation is a tongue-in-cheek label given to a great number of unauthorized Turkish film adaptations of popular foreign (particularly Hollywood) movies and television series, produced mainly in the 1970s and 1980s. Filmed on a shoestring budget with often comically simple special effects and no regard for copyright, Turksploitation films substituted exuberant inventiveness and zany plots for technical and acting skill, although noted Turkish actors did feature in some of these productions. Examples of this genre have gained popularity in Turkey, such as &quot;D√ºnyayƒ± Kurtaran Adam&quot; (&quot;The Man Who Saved The World&quot;), colloquially &quot;Turkish Star Wars&quot; (1982), which includes footage from &quot;Star Wars&quot; and music from many sci-fi films; or &quot;Ay≈üecik ve Sihirli C√ºceler R√ºyalar √úlkesinde&quot; (&quot;Little Ay≈üe and the Magic Dwarves in the Land of Dreams&quot;, 1971), based on &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.
* Vigilante films: films in which a person breaks the law to exact justice. These films were rooted in 1970s unease over government corruption, failure in the Vietnam War, and rising crime rates. They reflect the rising political trend of neoconservatism. The genre is believed to have originated with the 1970 film &quot;Joe&quot;. The classic example is the &quot;Death Wish&quot; series, starring Charles Bronson. Vigilante films often deal with individuals who cannot find help within the system, such as the Native American protagonist of &quot;Billy Jack&quot;, or characters in blaxploitation films such as &quot;Coffy&quot;, or people from small towns who go to larger cities in pursuit of runaway relatives, as in &quot;Hardcore&quot; (1979), &quot;Trackdown&quot; (1976) and &quot;Next of Kin&quot; (1989). There are &quot;vigilante cop&quot; movies about policemen who feel thwarted by the legal system, as in the &quot;Walking Tall&quot; series, &quot;Mad Max&quot;, and the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; series of Clint Eastwood movies. These are not considered to be true vigilante films in the classic sense, because they do not involve ordinary citizens seeking justice for a personal hurt. Similarly, Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; does not fit the category, because of its mentally disturbed protagonist.

== Modern homages ==
While cheap films with lurid content continue to be made today, the term &quot;exploitation film&quot; is rarely used to refer to modern-day films. Nevertheless, a number of films have been released in the 21st century paying homage to exploitation films of the past.
The 2007 double feature &quot;Grindhouse&quot; is the most prominent tribute to exploitation films (in this case, those of the 1970s). &quot;Grindhouse&quot; consists of the Robert Rodriguez film &quot;Planet Terror&quot; and the Quentin Tarantino film &quot;Death Proof&quot;, and also included numerous mock trailers for nonexistent films. Eventually, Rodriguez made &quot;Machete&quot;, which began as one such trailer. &quot;Hobo With a Shotgun&quot; also began as a mock trailer for the Canadian release of &quot;Grindhouse.&quot;
Similar films such as &quot;Chillerama&quot;, &quot;Drive Angry&quot; and &quot;Sign Gene&quot; have appeared since the release of &quot;Grindhouse&quot;. S. Craig Zahler&#x27;s film &quot;Brawl in Cell Block 99&quot; is one example, along with his 2018 noir film &quot;Dragged Across Concrete&quot;. Ti West&#x27;s slasher film &quot;X&quot; (2022) also pays homage to 1970s exploitation films.
The Syfy TV show &quot;Blood Drive&quot; takes inspiration from exploitation films, with each episode featuring a different theme. The animated series &quot;Seis Manos&quot; has a similar premise; it is a kung fu story taking place in 1970s Mexico and is shown with a similar grainy film filter and simulated projection miscues.
&quot;Manhunt&quot;, &quot;Red Dead Revolver&quot;, &quot;The House of the Dead: Overkill&quot;, &quot;Wet&quot;, &quot;Shank&quot;, &quot;RAGE&quot; and &quot;Shadows of the Damned&quot; are several examples of video games that serve as homages to exploitation movies.
The novel &quot;Our Lady of the Inferno&quot; is both written as an homage to exploitation films and features several chapters that take place in a grindhouse theater.
The author Jacques Boyreau released the book &quot;Portable Grindhouse: The Lost Art of the VHS Box&quot; in 2009 about the history of the genre, as told through the cover art from home video releases. Exploitation films are also the focus of the 2010 documentary &quot;American Grindhouse&quot;. Additionally, authors Bill Landis and Michelle Clifford released &quot;Sleazoid Express,&quot; discussing exploitation subgenres and serving as an homage to the various grindhouses within Times Square; the book includes excerpts from Landis&#x27; magazine of the same name.

<text>Man, Economy, and State: A treatise on economic principles is a 1962 book of Austrian School economics by Murray Rothbard (orig. abridged ed.). It was originally intended as a textbook form of Human Action by Ludwig von Mises, but became its own treatise after he realized original work was needed to flesh out Mises&#x27; ideas.

According to Salerno, the book Power and Market: Government and the Economy &quot;was originally written as the third volume of &quot;Man, Economy, and State&quot;, but was published separately eight years later&quot;. It was reunited with the 4th edition of &quot;Man, Economy, and State&quot; in 2004 in the volume sub-titled &quot;The Scholar&#x27;s Edition&quot; from the Ludwig von Mises Institute. The author analyzes the negative effects of the various kinds of government intervention, and argues that the State is neither necessary nor useful.

<text>Pet Your Friends is the first album by the American alternative rock band Dishwalla. It was released in 1995 on A&amp;M Records. The album included the hit single &quot;Counting Blue Cars&quot; (the second single from the album), which was a Top 40 favorite. The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s Parents&quot;, was popular at concerts, although it was not very successful in terms of sales. An acoustic version of &quot;Counting Blue Cars&quot; with an extended bridge was also popular on radio.

The image used for the cover of the album is taken from the August 23, 1948, &quot;Life&quot; magazine cover. The cover story talks about a 17-year-old girl who became friends with a friend&#x27;s pet deer while swimming one day.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; noted that, &quot;individually, the songs on the quartet&#x27;s &quot;Pet Your Friends&quot; CD make for passable radio ditties, but as a whole they amount to a rock-by-numbers sleepwalk.&quot; &quot;Bass Player&quot; praised the &quot;well-written alterna-pop tunes.&quot;

<doc id="620914" wikidata="Q654778" url="?curid=620914" title="London After Midnight (band)">
<text>London After Midnight is an American rock band from California. Formed in 1990 by songwriter and instrumentalist Sean Brennan, London After Midnight has a following worldwide, with a large fan base in the goth subculture. However, in interviews Brennan has shunned the use of this label and others to describe his music, calling it &quot;artistically limiting&quot;.

== Ideology and themes ==
Brennan is known for his support of animal rights, pro-environmental and human rights issues, anti-corporate control of media, and progressive and liberal politics. He voices this support through London After Midnight Internet outlets, such as their official website and music.

== History ==
London After Midnight formed in Los Angeles, California, and played at several clubs in the area starting in late 1990, with a debut concert at Los Angeles gothic rock club, Helter Skelter.

In the early days London After Midnight had various temporary members who joined Brennan when performing live, but did not perform on the albums. Tamlyn is credited on the first cassette recordings, co-authored the opening track &quot;This Paradise&quot; on &#x27;Selected Scenes From The End of the World&#x27;, contributed an instrumental called &quot;Ice&quot; for the 1998 release of &quot;Oddities&quot; at Brennan&#x27;s request, and an instrumental entitled &quot;Perversion&quot; on the 93&#x27; Ruins demo tape released as a preview of what was to become their second album, &quot;Psycho Magnet&quot;.

=== Early performance lineups ===
After garnering a fanbase aided by the release of a self-titled demo, London After Midnight released their debut album &quot;Selected Scenes from the End of the World&quot; in 1991. Special effects artist Nick Benson played bass guitar in an early lineup of the band, and participated in songwriting. In 1992 bassist Michael Areklett joined the lineup after the resignation of live bassist Rob Podzunas. Like Tamlyn, Michael Areklett appeared live as a recurring member, rather than a guest. Around this period, Douglas Avery also joined, replacing live drummer Ian Haas. Eddie Hawkins was part of the original live line up, but was replaced in 1990. John Koviak performed live on bass from 1990‚Äì1992.

==== Touring and releases ====
In the earliest days the live band played mainly on the West Coast of the United States. Following the release of the self-titled debut, LAM gradually expanded their Californian fan base, eventually traveling to Mexico in 1994 (something few alternative acts were doing at the time) and progressing to tour the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, South America and further in the United States.

Brennan then expanded on the original demo release and recorded more songs for &quot;Selected Scenes from the End of the World&quot; released in late 1992.

Coinciding with the release of the follow-up album &quot;Psycho Magnet&quot; in 1996, London After Midnight headlined the Whitby Gothic Weekend in England, among other concerts in the UK, Europe, Mexico and the US. At this time, Brennan had begun to expand musically. The project continued on with a third album titled &quot;Oddities&quot; released in 1998, featuring a cover of a track named &quot;Sally&#x27;s Song&quot; from the film &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;. This CD was different from other releases in that it featured acoustic and ethereal alternative mixes of songs, along with a few new tracks.

Around this time London After Midnight was garnering international press and was featured on the covers of many magazines, while co-headlining major concert festivals like the Zillo summer festival, with The Cure and Green Day. LAM has since toured the world extensively playing alongside other popular bands such as Green Day, HIM (who have cited LAM as an influence), Rammstein, Soft Cell, and others, headlining and co-headlining to crowds of over 30,000 in Latin America, the US and Europe.

=== Recent times ===

The album, &quot;Violent Acts of Beauty&quot;, was released in 2007. LAM has, however, re-released (in 2003) two of the past three releases in Europe and the Russian Federation, (which charted on the Deutsche Alternative Charts) adding previously unreleased bonus tracks.

In 2006, a new London After Midnight song was released on the &quot;Saw II&quot; motion picture soundtrack.

In February 2007, a teaser trailer for London After Midnight&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Violent Acts of Beauty&quot; was released on the band&#x27;s official website and YouTube page. The trailer stated that the album was due for a spring/summer 2007 release. The album itself was released in fall 2007 (North America). To promote the new album, they played at various festivals in Europe (Greece, Portugal, France, Spain, Belgium, Germany) with bands such as Kirlian Camera, Dope Stars, and Noctivagus.

<text>Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence is a technique for organizing persuasion that inspires people to take action. Alan H. Monroe developed this sequence in the mid-1930s. This sequence is unique because it strategically places these strategies to arouse the audience&#x27;s attention and motivate them toward a specific goal or action.

== Foundation ==
Alan H. Monroe developed Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence theory after studying John Dewey‚Äôs work on psycho-logic for human problem-solving and combining it with our human tendency to be self-motivated and self-centered. Additionally, Monroe‚Äôs sequence draws from Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy in the sense, that the problem has to correspond with Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs- lower level first. After combining these theories with his own, Monroe founded Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence. Motivated sequence aligns with Edmund Burke&#x27;s ideas on proper speech form and John Dewey&#x27;s ideas on qualitative unity.

== Alan H. Monroe ==
Alan H. Monroe was born in 1903. Monroe earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Northwestern University and taught at Purdue University. By 1926, Monroe shifted his focus from English to Public Speaking and by 1927, he was promoted to assistant professor of Public Speaking. Throughout his time teaching at Purdue University, Monroe continued his education at Northwestern University, earning his master&#x27;s degree in 1927 and his Doctorate in 1937. In 1963, Monroe retired from Purdue University. He died in 1975.

==Steps==
Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence states that on the first step is to state the problem the customer is having, then explain it if one cannot solidify the need and give a representation of the situation that may occur.
;Attention: The attention step is audience-focused and uses an attention-getter to catch the audience&#x27;s attention.
;Need: The topic is applied to the psychological needs of the audience members. Monroe believed that it was most effective to convince the audience that they had specific needs tailored to the topic of the presentation.
;Satisfaction: Specific and viable solutions to the problems raised in the previous step are presented to the audience.
;Visualization: The solution is then described in such a way that the audience can visualize both the solution and its positive effects in a detailed manner.
;Action: The audience is then told how to solve the problem using the solution(s) previously presented.

==Benefits==
The advantage of Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence is that it emphasizes what the audience can do. Too often the audience feels like a situation is hopeless; Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence emphasizes the action the audience can take. It also helps the audience feel like the speaker knows the problem at hand and is listening to them instead of just tuning them out.

With its sequential model, Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence engages an audience with a psychologically satisfying speech order. The industries of sales and advertising use Monroe&#x27;s step-by-step sequence to motivate potential buyers to take action (purchase a product). Monroe&#x27;s Motivated sequence presents itself as a core model in communication theory because there is otherwise little guidance for presenters in organizing ideas in persuasive speech.

The benefit of Monroe‚Äôs motivated sequence theory is that it focuses on persuasive techniques to reach an intended outcome. It does this by putting an unpleasant image in the audience&#x27;s head, and then following it with the more appealing option, that aligns with the speaker‚Äôs goal. By providing a background in persuasion, Monroe‚Äôs theory gives insight into how to gain the audience‚Äôs attention and even change current views, thoughts, or ideas. 

== Research ==
Researcher, Tracy Micciche, conducted a study on 21, 23, and 24-year-old college students, with the 22-year-olds being the control group. Participants were told that they would receive better parking for an extra $50. The study used three different versions explaining the $50 for parking. One version used Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence. They explained the parking fee in the order of attention, need, satisfaction, visualization, and call to action. Other variations used Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence in different orders. Micciche found that the explanation using Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence&#x27;s original order was significantly higher for the college students to understand.

In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi explored the idea of implementing the ‚ÄòJanta Curfew‚Äô or the ‚ÄòPeople Curfew‚Äô as a first step to stopping the spread of the virus Covid-19 on March 22, 2020. Narendra Modi used Monroe‚Äôs motivated sequence to persuade his citizens to implement a trial run lockdown from 7 am-9 pm, 14 hours, which was named the ‚ÄòJanta Curfew‚Äô before the ultimate decision of the Prime Minister to go on to a 41-day extensive lockdown. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had some words to say about the success of the trial run curfew, &quot;the experience gained from it, would prepare people for their upcoming challenges.‚Äù The success of this curfew was ultimately implemented and practiced by the people for the people.

A study conducted by Bernadette Peter Lidadun and Nancy Chiuh examined the use of Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence. In the study, Lidadun and Chiuh used reading assignments and gave them to a group of aspirants for the Catholic priesthood in a Formation House in Malaysia. The research was conducted with ten participants from February 2019 to June 2019. The research indicates that participants engage more in the five-step approach of Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence during extensive reading online. The study also found that refining each step of Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence is essential for people using English as a second language. Researchers watched these groups use Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence to see if there could be a scaffold for participants who would be more prepared to find their research before verbally presenting it. While Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence enthused participants&#x27; reading experience, there would need to be refinement on each research step before verbal presentation. In conclusion, while Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence enthused participants&#x27; reading experience, each step of the sequence must be refined to make it accessible for ESL readers.

Research conducted by Alen Mateo S. Munzo, on July 6‚Äì8, 2022, at the University of De La Salle, Manila, Philippines, used Monroe‚Äôs motivated sequence to determine communicative function by inviting viewers to apply themselves to an advocacy project. This study used Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence to visually see the learning outcomes of advocacy awareness from the course syllabus. The e-service program through the University of De La Salle, Manila, Philippines, aimed to provide an environment online that fosters personal goals. This study included 26 students enrolled in the purposive communication course. Students individually wrote essays before being grouped into five.

Seriaznita Mat Said, Ali Salman Hummadi, and Amerrudin Abd Manan conducted research on President Donald Trump&#x27;s Policy Speech in Jerusalem. Said, Hummadi, and Manan used Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence steps to analyze Trump&#x27;s speech. This study used the five steps of the sequence and found that President Trump was successful in his use of persuasion on four of the five steps of Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence. Results indicate that President Trump did not entirely complete the satisfaction step.

=== Non-English Speaking Ads ===
A study published in The Journal of Interpersonal Violence showcased Monroe‚Äôs motivated sequence theory by designing videos for Asian immigrant women regarding intimate partner violence (IPV). The video was made in four languages; Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese. Participants included Asian women ages 25‚Äì45. During the study, participants were shown a video on IPV and how to get help through primary care settings. Results showed nearly three-fourths of participants indicated that they felt the videos would be useful in encouraging IPV victims to disclose. The use of Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence to persuade viewers was found effective in this study; however, participants thought the need and visualization appeal could have been stronger. A similar study assessing IPV ads found advertisements should work on increasing self-confidence in performing the recommended behaviors, as well as encouraging perpetrators to make a firm commitment to ending domestic violence. In conclusion, results suggest that culturally relevant interventions based on persuasive theories like Monroe&#x27;s motivated sequence‚Äîsuch as multi-lingual videos placed in primary health clinic consultation rooms‚Äîmay help to overcome some of the barriers to immigrants‚Äô disclosure and start them on the path to a better future.

A study published in &quot;Strategic Communications in Africa: the sub-Saharan context&quot; covers an analysis of street ads in Yoruba language collected from Ibadan, Nigeria using Monroe‚Äôs motivated sequence. Its analysis focused on textual content, in terms of the words used in the selected street adverts. These aspects of content were thoroughly examined to establish how they pass messages that influence patronage of products and services. Results showed the connection Monroe‚Äôs motivated sequence with the selected street adverts. All the elements of Monroe‚Äôs motivated sequence were reflected in the selected adverts. Another study assessing Indonesian and Nigerian advertisements notes the importance of visual elements in advertisements complementing each other. In conclusion, Monroe&#x27;s steps, specifically visualization can be applied to Nigerian street ads.

<doc id="620929" wikidata="Q886447" url="?curid=620929" title="Pierre Nord Alexis">
<text>Pierre Nord Alexis (; 2 August 1820 ‚Äì 1 May 1910) was President of Haiti from 17 December 1902 to 2 December 1908.

==Early life==
He was the son of a high-ranking official in the regime of Henri Christophe, and Bl√©zine Georges, Christophe&#x27;s illegitimate daughter. Alexis joined the army in the 1830s, serving President Jean-Louis Pierrot, his father-in-law, as an aide-de-camp.

==Career==
In the ensuing years, he had a tumultuous career: he was exiled in 1874 but was allowed to return to Haiti a few years later by President Pierre Th√©oma Boisrond-Canal. During the presidency of Lysius Salomon, he was a vocal leader of the opposition, enduring several jail sentences before Salomon was finally ousted in a revolt. The new president, Florvil Hyppolite, gave him an important military position in the north, but when President Tir√©sias Simon Sam resigned, he joined Ant√©nor Firmin in a march on Port-au-Prince in an effort to seize control of the government.

The new president, however, was his old ally, Boisrond-Canal, who had returned him from exile some twenty years earlier. Canal defused the tension by appointing Alexis Minister of War, driving a wedge between him and Firmin. Troops loyal to Firmin were finally defeated in Port-au-Prince, leaving only two strongholds, Saint-Marc and Gona√Øves, opposed to the new government of Canal and Alexis. Alexis took advantage of the situation by negotiating with the United States and declaring himself in support of American interests in the Caribbean. The U.S. responded by imposing a naval blockade on the two centers still loyal to Firmin, paving the way for Alexis to seize control of the government for himself. On June 28, 1902 there was a street battle in Cap-Haitien between the Firmin and Alexis partisans. During the firminist revolt in 1902 he gave Eugene Francois Magloire the defense of Fort Belair in Cap-Haitien. He made him a spy during the Civil War.

==Presidency==
At the age of 82, he became President on 21 December 1902 by leading troops loyal to him into the country&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies. Alexis managed to hold on to power for the next six years, though his regime was plagued by rebellion. In 1903, he proclaimed Eug√®ne Francois Magloire Commandant of Grande-Rivi√®re du Nord, General of division of the republic and his honorary aide-de-camp. During his presidency, he took to justice all statesmen accused of corruption in 1904: &quot; le proc√®s de la consolidation&quot;. All who stole the state&#x27;s money were judged and condemned. In January 1908, Alexis, already in his eighties, decided to have himself proclaimed President for Life. This reunited the supporters of Firmin, who launched a new revolt against Alexis. While the revolt was crushed, it exacerbated the country&#x27;s existing economic problems. A famine in the south that same year led to violent food riots and a new rebellion, this time from the south, led by General Fran√ßois Antoine Simon. On the night of March 14, 1908 he got more than 20 firminists who were trying to overthrow him executed in front of the Cemetery of Port-au-Prince; Massillon Coicou was part of those executed firminists.
==Exile==
Ousted from power on 2 December 1908, Alexis went into exile in Jamaica and later relocated to New Orleans with his family, where he died on 1 May 1910. He is buried in St. Louis Cemetery #2 in New Orleans.

==Family==
Alexis was married to Princess Marie-Louise-Amelie-Celestina Pierrot, daughter of President Jean-Louis Pierrot (a general and later Prince under Henri I). From this marriage, he had a son who bore the name of Henri Nord Alexis, also known as Henri Alexis. His great-great-grandson Jacques-√âdouard Alexis was Prime Minister of Haiti twice: from 1999 to 2001 and from 2006 to 2008.
