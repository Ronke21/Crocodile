<text>Jean Domat, or Daumat (30 November 162514 March 1696) was a French jurist.

==Life==
Domat was born at Clermont in Auvergne. He studied the humaniora in Paris, where he befriended Blaise Pascal, and later law at the University of Bourges. Domat closely sympathized with the Port-Royalists, and on Pascal&#x27;s death he was entrusted with the latter&#x27;s private papers. After Domat&#x27;s promotion in 1645, he practised law in Clermont and was appointed a crown prosecutor there in 1655. In 1683, he retired from this office with a pension from Louis XIV to concentrate on his scholarship.

==Principal work==
Together with Antoine Dadin de Hauteserre, Antoine Favre and the Godefroy brothers, Domat was one of the few later French scholars of Roman law of international significance. He is principally known from his elaborate legal digest, in three quarto volumes, under the title of &quot;Lois civiles dans leur ordre naturel&quot; (1689, with 68 later editions), an undertaking for which Louis XIV settled on him a pension of 2,000 livres. A fourth volume, &quot;Le droit public&quot;, was published in 1697, a year after his death. After Hugo Doneau&#x27;s more thorough but less consistent &quot;Commentarii iuris civilis&quot; (1589), the work was the first of this type of pan-European significance. It was to become one of the principal sources of the &quot;ancien droit&quot; on which the Napoleonic Code was later founded.

Domat&#x27;s work was in line with earlier Humanist attempts to transform the seemingly random historical sources of law into a rational system of rules. However, as a supporter of a Cartesian juridical order, Domat endeavoured to found all law upon ethical or religious principles, his motto being &quot;L&#x27;homme est fait par Dieu et pour Dieu&quot; (&quot;Man was made by God and for God&quot;). The work was thus an attempt to establish a system of French law on the basis of moral principles, and it presented the contents of the Corpus Juris Civilis in the form of a new system of natural law.

After the work of Robert Joseph Pothier, Domat&#x27;s work is regarded as the second most important influence on the Civil Code of Lower Canada.

==Later life==
Besides the &quot;Lois civiles&quot;, Domat prepared, in Latin, a selection of the laws in the Digesta and the Codex Justinianeus under the title &quot;Legum delectus&quot; (Paris, 1700; Amsterdam, 1703); it was subsequently appended to the &quot;Lois civiles&quot;. Domat died in Paris on 14 March 1696.

<text>Hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) is a broadband telecommunications network that combines optical fiber and coaxial cable. It has been commonly employed globally by cable television operators since the early 1990s.

In a hybrid fiber-coaxial cable system, television channels are sent from the cable system&#x27;s distribution facility, the headend, to local communities through optical fiber subscriber lines. At the local community, an optical node translates the signal from a light beam to radio frequency (RF), and sends it over coaxial cable lines for distribution to subscriber residences. The fiber optic trunk lines provide enough bandwidth to allow additional bandwidth-intensive services such as cable internet access through DOCSIS. Bandwidth is shared among users of an HFC. Encryption is used to prevent eavesdropping. Customers are grouped into service groups, which are groups of customers that share bandwidth among each other since they use the same RF channels to communicate with the company.

==Description==

The fiber optic network extends from the cable operators&#x27; master headend, sometimes to regional headends, and out to a neighborhood&#x27;s hubsite, and finally to an optical to coaxial cable node which typically serves 25 to 2000 homes. A master headend will usually have satellite dishes for reception of distant video signals as well as IP aggregation routers. Some master headends also house telephony equipment (such as automatic telephone exchanges) for providing telecommunications services to the community. In an HFC network telephony is provided using PacketCable.

A regional or area headend/hub will receive the video signal from the master headend and add to it the public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV channels as required by local franchising authorities or insert targeted advertising that would appeal to a local area, along with internet from a CMTS (an Integrated CMTS, which includes all parts required for operation), or a CCAP which provides both internet and video.

Separate Edge QAMs can be used to provide QAM modulated video suitable for transmission in a coaxial cable network, from digital video sources. Edge QAMs can also be connected to a CMTS to provide internet data instead of video, in a modular CMTS architecture. CCAPs aim to replace the conventional, integrated CMTS which only provides data and Edge QAMs used for video which are separate pieces of equipment.

Video can be encoded according to standards such as NTSC, MPEG-2, DVB-C or the QAM standard and data according to DOCSIS, analog video can be scrambled, signals can be modulated by analog or digital video modulators including QAM modulators or edge QAMs for video and/or data depending on whether a modular CMTS is used, at the CMTS for data only, or at the CCAP for video and data, and upconverted onto RF carriers in this equipment.

The various services from CMTSs, CCAPs, Edge QAMs and QAM modulators are combined onto a single RF electrical signal using headend RF management modules such as splitters and combiners and the resulting signals are inserted into a broadband optical transmitter which in practice is a transmitter module in an &quot;optics platform&quot; or headend platform such as an Arris CH3000, Scientific Atlanta Prisma, or a Cisco Prisma II. 


These platforms host several transmitters and receivers the latter of which can be used for cable internet, and can also host Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs) to extend the reach of the optical signals in fiber optics. Each transmitter and receiver services one optical node.

This optical transmitter converts the RF electrical signal to a downstream optically modulated signal that is sent to the nodes. Fiber optic cables connect the headend or hub to the optical nodes in a point-to-point or star topology, or in some cases, in a protected ring topology. Each node can be connected via its own dedicated fiber, so fiber optic cables laid outdoors in the outside plant can have several dozen to several hundred or even thousands of fibers, an extreme example being 6912 fibers.

=== Fiber optic nodes ===
A fiber optic node has a broadband optical receiver, which converts the downstream optically modulated signal coming from the headend or hub to an electrical signal going to the customers. the downstream signal is a RF modulated signal that typically begins at 50 MHz and ranges from 550 to 1000 MHz on the upper end. The fiber optic node also contains a reverse- or return-path transmitter that sends communication from customers back to the headend. In North America, this reverse signal is a modulated RF ranging from 5–42 MHz while in other parts of the world, the range is 5–65 MHz. This electrical signal is then outputted through coaxial cable to form a coaxial trunk.

The optical portion of the network provides a large amount of flexibility. If there are not many fiber-optic cables to the node, wavelength division multiplexing can be used to combine multiple optical signals onto the same fiber. Optical filters are used to combine and split optical wavelengths onto the single fiber. For example, the downstream signal could be on a wavelength at 1550 nm and the return signal could be on a wavelength at 1310 nm.

=== Final connection to customers ===
The coaxial trunk portion of the network connects 25–2000 homes (500 is typical) in a tree-and-branch configuration off of the node.

Trunk coaxial cables are connected to the optical node and form a coaxial backbone to which smaller distribution cables connect. RF amplifiers called trunk amplifiers are used at intervals in the trunk to overcome cable attenuation and passive losses of the electrical signals caused by splitting or &quot;tapping&quot; the coaxial cable. Trunk cables also carry AC power which is added to the cable line at usually either 60 or 90 V by a power supply (with a lead acid backup battery inside) and a power inserter. The power is added to the cable line so that optical nodes, trunk and distribution amplifiers do not need an individual, external power source. The power supply might have a power meter next to it depending on local power company regulations.

From the trunk cables, smaller distribution cables are connected to a port of one of the trunk amplifiers called a bridger to carry the RF signal and the AC power down individual streets. Usually trunk amplifiers have two output ports: one for the trunk, and another as a bridger. Distribution amplifiers (also called system amplifiers) can be connected from a bridger port 
to connect several distribution cables to the trunk if more capacity is needed as they have multiple output ports. Alternatively, line extenders, which are smaller distribution amplifiers with only one output port, can be connected to the distribution cable coming off the bridger port in the trunk and used to boost the signals in the distribution cables to keep the power of the television signal at a level that the TV can accept. The distribution line is then &quot;tapped&quot; into and used to connect the individual drops to customer homes.

These RF taps pass the RF signal and block the AC power unless there are telephony devices that need the back-up power reliability provided by the coax power system. The tap terminates into a small coaxial drop using a standard screw type connector known as an F connector.

The drop is then connected to the house where a ground block protects the system from stray voltages. Depending on the design of the network, the signal can then be passed through a splitter to multiple TVs or to multiple set top boxes (cable boxes) which may then be connected to a TV. If too many splitters are used to connect multiple TVs, the signal levels will decrease, and picture quality on analog channels will decrease. The signal in TVs past those splitters will lose quality and require the use of a &quot;drop&quot; or &quot;house&quot; amplifier to restore the signal.

=== Evolution of HFC networks ===
Historically the trend among cable operators has been to reduce the amount of coaxial cable used in their networks to improve signal quality, which initially led to the adoption of HFC. HFC replaced coaxial cable networks which had coaxial trunk cables originating at the headend of the network, and HFC replaced part of these trunk cables with fiber optic cables and optical nodes. In these coaxial networks, trunk amplifiers were placed along the trunk cables to maintain adequate signal levels in the trunks, distribution feeder cables could be used to distribute signals from the trunks into individual streets, directional couplers were used to improve signal quality, trunk amplifiers could be equipped with automatic level control or automatic gain control, hybrid amplifiers, which have a hybrid integrated circuit could also be used, and separate bridgers were used to connect the trunk to distribution feeders.

In 1953, C-COR was the first to introduce cable powering which transmits power through coaxial cables for powering cable amplifiers. In 1965, it introduced the use of integrated circuits in amplifiers used on utility poles and in 1969 was the first to use heat fins on amplifiers. The first amplifiers in outdoor housings with hinges and seals, for installation between utility poles hanging from messenger wires, were offered in 1965. In around 1973, hubs began to be used in cable networks to increase signal quality as a result of network expansion, and cable operators made efforts to reduce the number of amplifiers in cascade on coaxial parts of the network from around 20 to 5. Supertrunks made of coaxial cable with FM modulated video signals, fiber optics or microwave links were used to connect headends to hubs. Fiber optics were first used as a supertrunk in 1976. FM video could be also carried in fiber optics, and fiber optics eventually replaced coaxial cables in supertrunks. Bandwidth in cable networks increased from 216 MHz to 300 MHz in the 1970s, to 400 MHz in the 1980s, to 550 MHz, 600 MHz and 750 MHz in the 1990s, and to 870 MHz in the year 2000.

To cope with needs for increased digital bandwidth such as for DOCSIS internet, cable operators have implemented expansions in the RF spectrum in HFC networks beyond 1 GHz to 1.2 GHz, have transitioned to only handling IP traffic in the network thus eliminating dedicated video RF channels, used digital transport adapters (DTAs) for transmitting normally analog signals, or used Switched Digital Video (SDV) which allows the number of television channels in coaxial cables to be reduced without reducing the number of channels that are offered.

Towards the end of the 1990s GaAs (Gallium Arsenide) transistors were introduced in HFC nodes and amplifiers, replacing silicon transistors which allowed an expansion of the spectrum used in HFC from 870 MHz to 1 GHz by 2006. GaN transistors, introduced in 2008 and adopted in the 2010s allowed for another expansion to 1.2 GHz, or for expansion from 550 MHz to 750 MHz in older networks to 1 GHz without changing the spacing between amplifiers.

Remote PHY is an evolution of the HFC network that aims to reduce the use of coaxial cable in the network and improve signal quality. In a conventional HFC network, headend equipment such as CMTSs and CCAPs are connected to the HFC network using RF interfaces which physically are coaxial cable connections and optical signals in fiber optic cables in the network are analog. In Remote PHY, equipment such as CMTSs or CCAPs are connected directly to the HFC network using fiber optics carrying digital signals, eliminating the RF interface and coaxial cables at the CMTS/CCAP and RF modulation at the headend, and replacing analog signals in fiber optic cables in the network, with digital signals such as 10 Gigabit Ethernet signals, which eliminate the need for calibrating the HFC network bi-annually, extends the reach of the network, reduces the cost of equipment and maintenance, and improves signal quality and allows for modulation such as 4096 QAM instead of 1024 QAM, allowing more information to be transmitted at a time, per bit. This requires more sophisticated optical nodes which can also convert signals from digital to analog performing modulation, unlike conventional optical nodes which only need to convert signals from optical to electrical. These devices are known as Remote PHY devices (RPDs) or Remote MACPHY devices (RMDs). RPDs come in shelf variants which can be installed in apartment buildings (MDUs, multi dwelling units) and can also be installed in optical nodes or at a small hub which distributes signals similarly to a conventional HFC network. Alternatively Remote PHY can allow for a CMTS/CCAP to be located in a remote data center away from customers.

Remote MACPHY, besides achieving the same purpose as Remote PHY, also moves all DOCSIS protocol functionality to the optical node or the outside plant, which can reduce latency when compared to Remote PHY. Remote CMTS/Remote CCAP builds upon this by moving all CMTS/CCAP functionality to the outside plant. Distributed Access Architecture (DAA) covers Remote PHY and Remote MACPHY and has as the goal, moving functions closer to end customers, allowing for easier capacity expansions as centralized facilities for equipment are downsized or potentially eliminated, and newer DOCSIS versions beyond DOCSIS 3.1 with higher speeds. Remote PHY allows for some reuse of existing equipment such as CMTSs/CCAPs by replacing components.

Virtual CCAPs (vCCAPs) or virtual CMTSs (vCMTSs) are implemented on commercial off the shelf x86-based servers with specialized software, are often implemented alongside DAA and can be used to increase service capacity without purchasing new CMTS/CCAP chassis, or add features to the CMTS/CCAP more quickly.

Improving internet speeds for customers can be carried out by reducing the number of service groups with subscribers from 500 subscribers to no more than 128, in what is known as a n+0 architecture, with a single node and no amplifiers. HFC networks operating at 1.8 GHz to 3 GHz have been explored with GaN transistors. Changes in the frequency range used for upstream signals have been proposed: a mid split which uses frequencies from 5 to 85 MHz for the upstream, a high split which uses a range from 5 to 205 MHz, and an ultra high split with several options that allow for ranges of up to 5 to 684 MHz. Full duplex (FDX) DOCSIS allows upstream and downstream signals to simultaneously occupy a single frequency range without time division multiplexing. Cable operators have been gradually shifting to FTTP networks using PON (Passive Optical Networks).

==Transport over HFC network==
By using frequency-division multiplexing, a HFC network may carry a variety of services, including analog TV, digital TV (SDTV or HDTV), video on demand, telephony, and internet traffic. Services on these systems are carried on RF signals in the 5 MHz to 1000 MHz frequency band.

The HFC network is typically operated bi-directionally, meaning that signals are carried in both directions on the same network from the headend/hub office to the home, and from the home to the headend/hub office. The &quot;forward-path&quot; or &quot;downstream&quot; signals carry information from the headend/hub office to the home, such as video content, voice and Internet traffic. The very first HFC networks, and very old unupgraded HFC networks, are only one-way systems. Equipment for one-way systems may use POTS or radio networks to communicate to the headend. HFC makes two-way communication over a cable network practical because it reduces the number of amplifiers in these networks.

The &quot;return-path&quot; or &quot;upstream&quot; signals carry information from the home to the headend/hub office, such as control signals to order a movie or internet upstream traffic. The forward-path and the return-path are carried over the same coaxial cable in both directions between the optical node and the home.

To prevent interference of signals, the frequency band is divided into two sections. In countries that have traditionally used NTSC System M, the sections are 52–1000 MHz for forward-path signals, and 5–42 MHz for return-path signals. Other countries use different band sizes, but are similar in that there is much more bandwidth for downstream communication than for upstream communication.

Traditionally, since video content was sent only to the home, the HFC network was structured to be &quot;asymmetrical&quot;: one direction has much more data-carrying capacity than the other direction. The return path was originally used for only some control signals to order movies, etc., which required very little bandwidth. As additional services have been added to the HFC network, such as Internet access and telephony, the return path is being utilised more.

=== Multiple-system operators ===

Multi-system operators (MSOs) developed methods of sending the various services over RF signals on the fiber optic and coaxial copper cables. The original method to transport video over the HFC network and, still the most widely used method, is by modulation of standard analog TV channels which is similar to the method used for transmission of over-the-air broadcast.

One analog TV channel occupies a 6-MHz-wide frequency band in NTSC-based systems, or an 8-MHz-wide frequency band in PAL or SECAM-based systems. Each channel is centred on a specific frequency carrier so that there is no interference with adjacent or harmonic channels. To be able to view a digitally modulated channel, home, or customer-premises equipment (CPE), e.g. digital televisions, computers, or set-top boxes, are required to convert the RF signals to signals that are compatible with display devices such as analog televisions or computer monitors. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has ruled that consumers can obtain a cable card from their local MSO to authorize viewing digital channels.

By using digital video compression techniques, multiple standard and high-definition TV channels can be carried on one 6 or 8 MHz frequency carrier, thus increasing the channel carrying capacity of the HFC network by 10 times or more versus an all-analog network.

==Comparison to competing network technologies==
Digital subscriber line (DSL) is a technology used by traditional telephone companies to deliver advanced services (high-speed data and sometimes video) over twisted pair copper telephone wires. It typically has lower data carrying capacity than HFC networks and data speeds can be range-limited by line lengths and quality.

Satellite television competes very well with HFC networks in delivering broadcast video services. Interactive satellite systems are less competitive in urban environments because of their large round-trip delay times, but are attractive in rural areas and other environments with insufficient or no deployed terrestrial infrastructure.

Analogous to HFC, fiber in the loop (FITL) technology is used by telephone local exchange carriers to provide advanced services to telephone customers over the plain old telephone service (POTS) local loop.

In the 2000s, telecom companies started significant deployments of fiber to the x (FTTX) such as passive optical network solutions to deliver video, data and voice to compete with cable operators. These can be costly to deploy but they can provide large bandwidth capacity especially for data services.

<doc id="617704" wikidata="Q7310927" url="?curid=617704" title="Release consistency">
<text>Release consistency is one of the synchronization-based consistency models used in concurrent programming (e.g. in distributed shared memory, distributed transactions etc.).

== Introduction ==
In modern parallel computing systems, memory consistency must be maintained to avoid undesirable outcomes. Strict consistency models like sequential consistency are intuitively composed but can be quite restrictive in terms of performance as they would disable instruction level parallelism which is widely applied in sequential programming. To achieve better performance, some relaxed models are explored and release consistency is an aggressive relaxing attempt.

== Release consistency vs. sequential consistency ==

=== Hardware structure and program-level effort ===
Sequential consistency can be achieved simply by hardware implementation, while release consistency is also based on an observation that most of the parallel programs are properly synchronized. In programming level, synchronization is applied to clearly schedule a certain memory access in one thread to occur after another. When a synchronized variable is accessed, hardware would make sure that all writes local to a processor have been propagated to all other processors and all writes from other processors are seen and gathered. In release consistency model, the action of entering and leaving a critical section are classified as &quot;acquire&quot; and &quot;release&quot; and for either case, explicit code should be put in the program showing when to do these operations&quot;.&quot;

=== Conditions for sequential consistent result ===
In general, a distributed shared memory is release consistent if it obeys the following rules:

1. Before an access to a shared variable is performed, all previous acquires by this processor must have completed.

2. Before a release is performed, all previous reads and writes by this process must have completed.

3. The acquire and release accesses must be processor consistent.

If the conditions above are met and the program is properly synchronized (i.e., processors implement acquire and release properly), the results of any execution will be exactly the same as they would have been executed following sequential consistency. In effect, accesses to shared variables are separated into atomic operation blocks by the &quot;acquire&quot; and &quot;release&quot; primitives so that races and interleaving between blocks will be prevented.

== Implementations ==

=== Lock release ===

A lock release can be considered as a type of release synchronization. Assume a loop operation is performed using the code shown to the right. Two threads intend to enter a critical section and read the most recent value of , then exit the critical section. The code shows that thread 0 first acquires the lock and enters the critical section. In order to execute correctly, P1 must read the latest value of written by P0. In that case, only one thread can be in the critical section at a time. Therefore, the synchronization itself has ensured that the successful lock acquisition at P1 occurs after lock release by P0. Besides, the S2 -&gt; S3 ordering has to be ensured, since the P0 must propagate the new value of to P1. For the same reason, S5 must occur after S4.

Correctness is not affected if memory accesses following the unlock issue before the unlock complete or memory accesses prior to a lock issue after the lock acquisition. However, the code in critical section can not be issued prior to the lock acquisition is complete because mutual exclusion may not be guaranteed.

=== Post-wait ===

Post-wait synchronization is another implementation form of release consistency. As shown in the code to the right, correctness can be ensured if post operations occur only after all memory access are complete, especially the store to ‘a’. Apart from that, read operation should not be executed until the wait operation has completed. S2 acts as a release synchronization and S3 acts as an acquire synchronization. Therefore, S2 needs to prevent previous execution from occurring after it, and S3 needs to prevent any later execution from occurring before it. S2 does not need to prevent later execution from occurring before it, Likewise, S3 does not need to prevent any previous execution from occurring after it.

== Lazy release consistency ==

Lazy release consistency is a further optimization of release consistency. It assumes that the thread executing an acquire access does not need the values written by other threads until the acquire access has completed. Hence, all behavior of coherence can be delayed and timing for write propagation can be tweaked.

=== Example ===
Consider the scenarios described in the image to the right. This case shows when write propagation is performed on a cache-coherent system based on the release consistency model. The variable &quot;datum&quot; is completely propagated before the propagation of &quot;datumIsReady.&quot; But the value of &quot;datum&quot; is not needed until after the acquire synchronization access in P1 and it can be propagated along with &quot;datumIsReady&quot; without harming the result of the program.
The second image displays what is the case when lazy release consistency is applied. Considering this scenario, all values written ahead of the release synchronization are delayed and propagated together with the propagation of the release access itself. Hence, &quot;datum&quot; and &quot;datumIsReady&quot; are propagated together at the release point.

&quot;TreadMarks&quot; is an actual application of lazy release consistency.

=== Performance improvement over release consistency ===
Lazy release consistency can outperform release consistency in certain cases. If there is a system with little bandwidth between processors or it suffers badly from the higher overheads because of frequent propagation of small block of data versus infrequent large data block propagation, LRC can really help the performance.

Consider a system employs a software level shared memory abstraction rather than an actual hardware implementation. In this system, write propagation is executed at a page granularity, which makes it extremely expensive to propagate a whole page when only one block in this page is modified. Therefore, write propagation is delayed until a release synchronization point is reached and the entire page will be modified at this time and the whole page will be propagated.

=== Drawback ===
LRC requires performing write propagation in bulk at the release point of synchronization. Propagating such a large number of writes altogether will slow down the release access and the subsequent acquire access. Hence it can hardly improve the performance of a hardware cache coherence system.

== Release consistency vs. other relaxed consistency models ==

=== Weak ordering (Weak consistency) ===
Release consistency requires more from the programmers compared to weak ordering. They must label synchronization accesses as acquires or releases, not just as synchronization accesses. Similar to weak ordering, Release consistency allows the compiler to freely reorder loads and stores except that they cannot migrate upward past an acquire synchronization and cannot migrate downward past a release synchronization. However, the flexibility and performance advantage of Release consistency comes at the expense of requiring synchronization accesses to be properly identified and identified as acquires and releases. Unlike in weak ordering, synchronization accesses cannot be easily identified by instruction opcodes alone. Hence, the burden is on programmers’ shoulders to properly identify acquire and release synchronization accesses.

=== Processor consistency ===
For processor consistency, all processes see writes from each processor in the order they were initiated. Writes from different processors may not be seen in the same order, except that writes to the same location will be seen in the same order everywhere. Compared to processor consistency, release consistency is more relaxed because it does not enforce the ordering between stores that happens in processor consistency. It doesn&#x27;t follow programmers&#x27; intuition as it is relatively less restrictive to compiler optimizations.

<doc id="617705" wikidata="Q4834657" url="?curid=617705" title="BASIC-PLUS">
<text>BASIC-PLUS is an extended dialect of the BASIC programming language that was developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for use on its RSTS/E time-sharing operating system for the PDP-11 series of 16-bit minicomputers in the early 1970s through the 1980s.

BASIC-PLUS was based on BASIC-8 for the TSS/8, itself based very closely on the original Dartmouth BASIC. BASIC-PLUS added a number of new structures, as well as features from JOSS concerning conditional statements and formatting. In turn, BASIC-PLUS was the version on which the original Microsoft BASIC was patterned.

Notable among the additions made to BASIC-PLUS was the introduction of string functions like and , in addition to Dartmouth&#x27;s original all-purpose command. In future versions of the language, notably Microsoft&#x27;s, was removed and BASIC-PLUS&#x27;s string functions became the only ways to perform these sorts of operations. Most BASICs to this day follow this convention.

The language was later rewritten as a true compiler as BASIC-Plus-2, and was ported to the VAX-11 platform as that machine&#x27;s native BASIC implementation. This version survived several platform changes, and is today known as VSI BASIC for OpenVMS.

==Operation==
Users would sit at a terminal and type in programming language statements. The statements could either be entered into the system&#x27;s command interpreter directly, or entered into a text editor, saved to a file, and loaded into the command interpreter from the file. Errors in source code were reported to the user immediately after the line was typed.

As a smart terminal with cursor control could not be guaranteed, BASIC-PLUS used the common system of prefixing all source code with a line number. The code was edited by typing in the number and then changing the contents of the following code. A line of code could be removed by typing in its line number and nothing else, thereby setting it to an empty line.

The virtual address space of an RSTS/E user was limited to a little less than 64KB of space. Using BASIC-PLUS, about half of this virtual address space was used by the combined command interpreter and run-time library (named the Run Time System on RSTS/E). This limited user programs to about 32 kB of memory.

Large programs were broken into separate executable pieces by use of the statement, and programs could chain to specific line numbers in a secondary program to indicate that a program should begin execution at a different point from its first line. This feature of chaining to a certain line number allowed programs to signal to each other that they were being called from another program. The use of a shared memory section called core common also allowed programs to pass data to each other as needed. Disk files could also be used but were slower.

To conserve memory, the system included a garbage collecting memory manager, used for both string data and byte-code.

A running program could be interrupted, have variables examined and modified, and then be resumed.

==Syntax and features==
BASIC-PLUS is patterned closely on later versions of Dartmouth BASIC, including its powerful codice_1 commands. On top of this, DEC added a number of unique flow-control structures.

===Editing===
Line numbers were positive integers from 1 to 32767. Logical lines of code could be continued on multiple physical lines by using a line feed at the end of a line instead of the normal carriage return character. For ease of external editing of the source file, later versions of BASIC-PLUS also allowed the character as a line continuation character.

Multiple statements could be placed on a single line using as the statement separator. The system allowed tabs to be used as inline whitespace, and was used to make loops more clear, as in modern languages. Comments used either the keyword or the character, as opposed to MS BASICs, which used and .

===Standard statements===
The command divided the screen into regions 14 spaces wide, and the comma was used to move between these locations; would output 1, 2 and 3 in a spaced-out fashion, while would leave a single space and produce &quot;1 2 3&quot;. allowed a prompt string to be specified, but used the semicolon to separate it rather than the comma; 

Strings could be delimited by single or double quotes. In addition to the and functions that converted single characters to and from string format, BASIC-PLUS also supported Dartmouth&#x27;s command. iterated the string and returned each character&#x27;s ASCII value as a slot in a numeric array. For instance, would return an array with the five ASCII codes, 110, 105, 114, 114, 105, in elements 1 through 5, and the number 5, the length of the string, in element 0. One could reverse the operation as well, would read the individual numbers in the X array and convert it to a string.

===Statement modifiers===
BASIC-PLUS added the concept of &quot;statement modifiers&quot;, JOSS-like conditions that could be applied to any statement. For instance, is the equivalent of The opposite was also provided, was the equivalent of .

 loops worked as in other versions of BASIC, and the command could not be used in an expression to exit early. Instead, the and keywords could be used to control early exits. For instance, continue looping until I=10, with the assumption that following code would set the value of I, meaning it might not exit after 10 iterations but as soon as the code set I to 10. Modifiers could also be used to build compact one-line loops, for instance, would loop until X was 100.

===Variables, expressions and matrixes===
Variable names in the early versions of BASIC-PLUS could be a single letter or a single letter followed by a single digit. With the inclusion of &quot;Extend mode&quot; in later versions, variable names could be up to 29 characters long, and dot (.) was added as a permitted character. Every variable name still had to begin with a letter. As in most versions of BASIC, the keyword, for variable assignment, was optional. It could set multiple variables to a single value, like .

The language supported three data types; floating-point numbers, integers, and strings. Variables with no suffix were floating point (8 bytes, range 0.29 to 1.7, up to 16 digits of precision). Integer variables (16-bit, range −32768 to +32767) were indicated with a suffix, string variables (variable length) were indicated with a suffix.

The list of mathematical and logical operators was typical of most BASICs, with some extensions. For math, , , , and were supported, along with as an alternate form of for computer terminals that might not have that character. Standard logical comparisons were , , , , , and . One interesting addition was the operator, for &quot;approximately equal&quot;. This would return true if the two numbers would be printed the same, that is, their six most significant digits were the same. Logical operators included the typical , and , along with , which return true if both A and B are true or both are false, and which is false if A is true and B is false and otherwise always true.

The statement could allocate one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays of any of the three data types. The range of subscripts always began with 0 (but statements did not set elements in row 0 or column 0).

The language also included a number of commands to work with the entire array (or MATrix). The command would fill the matrix with values in a statement, would fill the array with user-typed values, and would print out the elements in a 1D or 2D format. could also be used to set default values in a matrix using associated keywords, for instance, would fill the A array with zeros. would transpose an entire matrix, and would invert it. Additionally, , , and could be used on matrixes, performing the associated matrix operation.

===File processing===
The &quot;virtual DIM&quot; statement could map &quot;virtual data array(s)&quot; or &quot;virtual array(s)&quot; to a disk file, which allowed arrays larger than the computer&#x27;s available memory (or even its address space), and allowed use of array elements to read, write, and extend disk files (persistent storage). They called this arrangement &quot;virtual data storage&quot; and &quot;virtual core&quot;, but it did not use the modern approach of allocating the arrays and a memory-mapped file. Instead, a single buffer was used to store 512 bytes of data at a time, and when an entry in the virtual array was accessed, the corresponding data was read, and old data written, as required. The statement caused the buffer to be written back (if necessary) before closing the file. Because no additional sectors were cached, accessing data in the &quot;wrong&quot; order could multiply the number of disk accesses. Additional rules were imposed on virtual arrays, such that one datum could never span a record boundary: Each data type was aligned to a multiple of its size. Virtual strings were stored as fixed-length ASCIIZ data, with sizes restricted to 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 bytes, and were accessed using and .

==Virtual machine==
BASIC-PLUS was not an interpreter but a compile and go system: each line of BASIC was translated into &quot;PPCODE&quot; (Push-Pop Code) as it was entered, for subsequent fast execution on its virtual machine. These translations did not tokenize the BASIC lines but rewrote them for use on a stack machine; you could not translate these representations back to BASIC statements. This avoided the need to repeatedly decode the keywords as strings: once converted to PPCODE the keywords were numbers that pointed to routines to run that function. BASIC-PLUS included a command, but this was not a true compiler; this simply saved the program&#x27;s PPCODE representation so that it did not have to be recompiled when the BASIC program was next loaded into memory. The system stored a user&#x27;s program in two formats. One was the editable source code in text format, created using the command and normally placed in a .BAS file. The other was the PPCODE version of the program created by the command and saved to a .BAC file; .BAC files were smaller and loaded and ran faster, but could not be edited.

==BASIC Plus 2==

A related product called Basic Plus 2 (&quot;BP2&quot; or BASIC-Plus-2), was later developed by DEC to add additional features and increased performance.

It used true compilation into threaded code and wrote its output to object files compatible with the machine code object files produced by the assembler and other language systems. These object files could be kept in libraries. A linker (the TKB, also known as the taskbuilder) then created executable files from object files and the libraries. TKB also supported overlays; this allowed individual routines to be swapped into the virtual address space as needed, overlaying routines not currently being used.

Additionally, BP2 programs ran under the RSX Run Time System; this RTS only occupied 8KB of the user&#x27;s virtual address space, leaving 56KB for the user&#x27;s program. (RSTS/E version 9 introduced separate Instruction and Data space, and the &quot;disappearing&quot; RSX Run Time System, permitting up to 64KB of each of instruction code and data.) These two factors allowed individual BP2 programs to be much larger than BASIC-PLUS programs, often reducing the need for CHAINing among multiple programs.

Unlike BASIC-PLUS (which was only available on RSTS/E), BP2 was also available for the RSX-11 operating system. BP2 programs were also more compatible with the later VAX BASIC.

==Comparison to MS BASIC==
Microsoft BASIC was patterned very closely on BASIC-PLUS. Earlier versions of MS BASIC, the 1.x series, lacked integer variables, but these were added in the 2.x series that was found on many machines, including the later models of the Commodore PET and Commodore 64. The ability to place logical and loop commands in-line, like was not copied over and does not appear on any common version of microcomputer BASIC. MS BASIC also lacked the matrix commands.

<doc id="617711" wikidata="Q3010461" url="?curid=617711" title="César Gutiérrez">
<text>César Dario Gutiérrez [goo-te-er&#x27;-rez] (January 26, 1943 – January 22, 2005), also nicknamed &quot;Cocoa&quot;, was a Venezuelan professional baseball player. He played as a shortstop in Major League Baseball for the San Francisco Giants in the 1967 and 1969 seasons, and for the Detroit Tigers from 1969 to 1971. Listed at 5&#x27;9&quot; and 155 lbs, he batted and threw right handed. Gutiérrez is notable for being the second player in Major League history to record seven hits in a game without making an out.

==Career==
Born in Coro, Falcón, Gutiérrez was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an amateur free agent in 1960. He was released in 1962, then was signed by the Giants before the 1963 season. Gutiérrez hit a combined .182 average in just 33 games for the Giants in parts of two seasons, before being traded to Detroit during the 1969 midseason.

His most productive season came in 1970 with the Tigers, when he became the everyday shortstop for the team, while posting career-highs in batting average (.243), RBI (22), runs (40), hits (101), doubles (11), triples (6), stolen bases (4) and games played (135), although he committed 23 errors for the third highest total in the league.

On June 21, 1970 in the second game of a doubleheader against the Cleveland Indians, Gutiérrez collected seven hits in seven at bats including a double, to become the second player in Major League history, after Wilbert Robinson, to record seven hits in a game without making an out. The Tigers won 9–8 in twelve innings, as his batting average went up 31 points that day, from .218 to .249.

Nevertheless, in 1971, Gutiérrez lost his regular shortstop position to Ed Brinkman, who had been acquired in a blockbuster six-player trade with the Washington Senators in the off-season. He played 40 games as a utility infielder for Detroit, batting only .189. Gutiérrez was sold to the Montreal Expos prior to the start of the next season, being assigned to their Triple-A affiliate, the Peninsula Whips, where after playing in only 12 games he was then released and picked up by the San Diego Padres, who assigned him to their Triple-A Hawaii Islanders affiliate club. Gutiérrez played the rest of the 1972 season in Hawaii, and retired at the end of the year.

==Career statistics==
In a four-year career, Gutiérrez played in 223 games, accumulating 128 hits in 545 at bats for a .235 career batting average and 26 runs batted in without home runs. He ended his career with a .953 fielding percentage.

In between, Gutiérrez played winter baseball in the Venezuelan League from 1961 to 1976. He later became a manager in the Mexican League, and served as a coach and scout with several teams.

Gutiérrez died in Cabimas, Zulia State, Venezuela, four days short of his 62nd birthday.

<doc id="617712" wikidata="Q3172759" url="?curid=617712" title="Folk costume">
<text>Folk costume, traditional dress, traditional attire or folk attire, is clothing associated with a particular ethnic group, nation or region, and is an expression of cultural, religious or national identity. If the clothing is that of an ethnic group, it may also be called ethnic clothing or ethnic dress. Traditional clothing often has two forms: everyday wear, and formal wear. The word &quot;costume&quot; in this context is sometimes considered pejorative, as the word has more than one meaning, and thus &quot;clothing&quot;, &quot;dress&quot;, &quot;attire&quot; or &quot;regalia&quot; can be substituted without offense.

Following the rise of romantic nationalism in parts of Europe, pre-industrial peasantry came to serve as models for all that appeared genuine and desirable. Garments that evoke peasant dress were made from traditional pre-industrial textiles.

In areas where Western styles of dress have become typical, traditional garments are often worn during special events or celebrations, particularly those connected to cultural tradition or heritage. International events may cater to non-Western attendees with a compound dress code such as &quot;business suit or national dress&quot;.

There are also contemporary societies in which traditional garments are required by sumptuary laws. In Bhutan, for example, the mandates what citizens should wear in public spaces. Bhutanese citizens must wear the traditional clothing of the Ngalop people, including a and for men and a and for women, including when on official business, in schools and institutions, and at official occasions and assemblies. These restrictions apply to when people are in or near &quot;monastic fortresses (), monasteries () and temples (), and in government buildings. Karin Altmann, a scholar of textile arts, states that the intent behind this law &quot;was to prevent specific features of Bhutanese culture from disappearing,&quot; and &quot;to emphasize national identity&quot;, but it has contributed to much conflict due to the ethnic and cultural diversity of Bhutan.

<text>Jean-Baptiste-Léon Say (6 June 1826, Paris – 21 April 1896, Paris) was a French statesman and diplomat.

One of the 19th-century&#x27;s noted economists, he served as French Finance Minister from 1872 until 1883.

==Biography==
The Say family is a most remarkable one. His grandfather, Jean-Baptiste Say, was a well-known economist. His brother Louis-Auguste Say (1774–1840) was a director of a sugar refinery at Nantes who wrote several books on economics; his son, Horace-Émile Say (1794–1860), Léon Say&#x27;s father, was educated at Geneva, before travelling in America. After returning to Paris, he then established himself in business later becoming President of Paris Chamber of Commerce in 1848; his acclaimed study of industrial conditions in Paris earned him a seat at the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences in 1857.

Léon Say was thus imbued with a zeal for economic study and theory, which first emerged at the age of twenty-two with his brief &quot;Histoire de la caisse descompte&quot;. Having initially been destined for the law, he became a banker and then was appointed as an executive for the Chemins de fer du Nord. Meanwhile, he was a regular contributor to the &quot;Journal des débats&quot;, growing his reputation through a series of brilliant attacks on the financial administration of Baron Haussmann, Prefect of the Seine.

He displayed a particular talent for engaging popular audiences in economic questions. His sympathies, like those of his grandfather, lay with the British economics school of thought, and he established a reputation as a proponent of free-trade principles for France. As a fluent English speaker, well acquainted with its customs and institutions, Say translated into French Goschen&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Foreign Exchanges&quot;.

He was one of the pioneers of the co-operative movement in France. Elected to the Assembly of 1871 for the Departments of Seine and Seine-et-Oise, he adopted the former, taking his seat with the Moderate Liberals, whose principles he espoused throughout his life. He was immediately chosen as rapporteur to the parliamentary commission regarding the state of French national finances, and in this capacity he produced two elaborate statements. Thiers, though opposing their publication on grounds of public expediency, was much struck by the ability displayed in them, and on 5 June appointed Say as Prefect of the Seine.

The fall of the Empire, the siege of Paris, and the Commune had reduced the administration of the capital to chaos, and the task of reconstruction severely tried the prefecture&#x27;s administration. This was, however, a gift to Say who was eminently suited to the task; he only quit this post to assume, in December 1872, the office of Minister of Finance — a remarkable tribute to his abilities from Thiers, who held strong protectionist views. In that same year, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

In all other respects Say regarded himself as the disciple of Thiers, who, in his last public utterance, designated Say as one of the younger men who should carry on his work. He fell from office with Thiers on 24 May 1873 and became leader of the Centre-Left parliamentary group, having unsuccessfully contested the Presidency of the Chamber against Buffet. In spite of their divergent views, he consented, at the urgent request of Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta and President of France, to take office in March 1875 in the Buffet Cabinet; but the reactionary policy of the Prime Minister led to a dispute between him and Say both in the press and in parliament, leading to Buffet&#x27;s resignation.

Say continued to hold the Finance ministerial brief under Dufaure and Jules Simon, and again in the Dufaure Government of December 1877, as well as in the succeeding Waddington Cabinet, till December 1879. During this long period, in which he became the undoubted doyen of French financial affairs; he first had to make repayment for the War Indemnity — a task which, owing largely to his consummate knowledge of foreign exchange markets, was effected long before the prescribed time. It was at a conference held between Say, Gambetta and Charles de Freycinet in 1878 that the great scheme of public works, introduced by the latter, was adopted as government policy.

Say&#x27;s general financial outlook was to ameliorate the burden of taxation. In accordance with his free-trade market principles, he believed that the surest way of enriching the French nation, and therefore its Treasury, was to remove all restrictions on internal commerce. Accordingly, Say reduced the rate of postage, repealed duties on many basic utilities, such as paper, and fought strongly, though unsuccessfully, against the system of &quot;octrois&quot;.

On 30 April 1880 he accepted the post of Ambassador to London for the purpose of negotiating a commercial treaty between France and Britain, but the Presidency of the Senate having become vacant, he was elected to this office on 25 May, but not before securing an outline agreement with the British Government, an important feature of which was the reduction of duty on cheaper French wines.

In January 1882 he became Minister of Finance in the Freycinet Cabinet, which was defeated in the following July over the Egyptian question. Say&#x27;s economic policies fell out of favour with the new generation of French politicians, since his academic Liberalism became regarded as old-fashioned; Socialism, which he never ceased to attack, obtained even greater power, and free-trade was discarded in favor of Félix Méline&#x27;s protectionism, against which Say organized in vain the &quot;Ligue contre le renchérissement du pain&quot;. He had, however, a large share in the successful opposition to raising income tax, which he considered likely to discourage individual effort and thrift.

In 1889 he resigned from the Senate to enter the Chamber as Deputy for Pau, in the belief that his efforts for Liberalism were more urgently needed in the National Assembly. Throughout his career he was indefatigable both as a writer and as a lecturer on economics, and in both capacities exerted a far wider influence than just in political circles.

Special mention must be made of his work, as editor and contributor, on the &quot;Dictionnaire des finances&quot; and &quot;Nouveau Dictionnaire d&#x27;économie politique&quot;. His style was easy and lucid, and he was often called upon for advice in drawing up important official documents, such as the famous presidential message of December 1877. He was for many years the most prominent member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques, and in 1886 was appointed to an Académie française seat, succeeding Edmond About.

Say died in Paris on 21 April 1896. A selection of his most important writings and speeches has since been published in four volumes under the title of &quot;Les Finances de la France sous la troisime république&quot; (1898 1901).

<text>Intimate and Live is the debut live album by Australian singer and songwriter Kylie Minogue. It was released on 30 November 1998 as a double CD set, and on 23 July 2002 as a DVD through BMG, Mushroom Records and Warner Vision. The concert was filmed at Capitol Theatre on 1 July 1998 from the Intimate and Live concert tour. Produced by David Wilson and directed by Mark Adamson and Michael Williams, both the album and DVD features twenty-one songs from the concert and spawned a promotional single, &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;.

The tour was in support of Minogue&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;, playing eight songs from the album. The album received positive reviews for Minogue&#x27;s clear delivery with slight criticism towards the covers, the DVD edition received mixed reviews from music critics for its visuals and stage production. The album reached number twenty-eight on the Australian Albums Chart, her first and highest live album to chart alongside the 2007 live album &quot;&quot; respectively. The DVD peaked at number one and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of 15,000 units.

==Background and material==

The album and DVD were recorded and filmed on 1 July 1998 at the Capitol Theatre in Sydney, Australia from the Intimate and Live concert tour. The photography used on the front cover was by Campbell Knott, while one image in the booklet is shot by Natalie Stevenson. Both the album and DVD cover sleeve was designed by Andrew Murabito, who worked directly through Mushroom for specialised artworks and cover designs. Both Minogue&#x27;s creative designers, British musician and producer Steve Anderson and British fashion designer William Baker, produced the album and DVD, who at the time had no experience in touring or producing a live album. Despite this, both Anderson and Baker carried on producing her live work in the future.

The CD was released through Mushroom on 28 November 1998. It contains eight tracks from the supporting album &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;; &quot;Too Far&quot;, &quot;Some Kind of Bliss&quot;, &quot;Breathe&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Style&quot;, &quot;Say Hey&quot;, &quot;Drunk&quot;, &quot;Did It Again&quot;, &quot;Limbo&quot; and two unreleased tracks &quot;Free&quot; and &quot;Take Me With You&quot;, alongside previous material. In addition, Minogue performed two cover songs on the tour; &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; by Swedish group ABBA and &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go?&quot; by American group The Clash. To promote the tour subsequently, Minogue and her Australian label Mushroom Records released &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; as a promotional single which also included the live version of &quot;Cowboy Style&quot;. The VHS of the concert was released a month later through Roadshow Entertainment and Mushroom, featuring all twenty-one tracks from the album. The reverse spiral dual layer (RSDL) DVD was released on 23 July 2002 through Warner Vision and BMG in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and featured all twenty-one tracks from the album. The video footage for &quot;Cowboy Style&quot; was used as its official music video, which was directed by Michael Williams.

==Reception==

&quot;Intimate and Live&quot; received favorable reviews from most music critics. While reviewing the concert tour and the CD/DVD versions, a reviewer from &quot;The Independent&quot; called the live performance &quot;fantastic&quot;. The reviewer felt songs like &quot;I Should be So Lucky&quot; was &quot;not only an inspired arrangement, but Kylie even sang it well: the helium she overdosed on in the late 1980s has worn off.&quot; Allmusic editor Chris True had highlighted tracks &quot;Too Far&quot;, &quot;What Do I Have to Do?&quot; and &quot;Limbo&quot; as album stand outs. Although he rated it three stars and called the music &quot;solid&quot;, he felt &quot;her soft dance-pop version of the Clash&#x27;s &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go?&quot; is downright awful. Mainly for die-hard collectors, less familiar fans will want to check out a greatest-hits compilation or her 1997 album Impossible Princess.&quot; An editor from &quot;JB Hi-Fi&quot; had praised the DVD version, feeling she was &quot;all grown up&quot; and &quot;Kylie truly was the prom-queen and this really was her homecoming.&quot; Pete Mellor from &quot;Michael DVD.co.au&quot; awarded the album three-and-a-half stars out of four, and the DVD two-and-a-half. For the album, he commended the quality by saying it was &quot;clear&quot; and was &quot;able to understand&quot;, while he criticized the colour saturation and staging of the show and editing.

Due to the positive reception and success of the tour, Minogue had written an open note on the album booklet;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Intimate and Live&quot; entered at number twenty-eight on the Australian Albums Chart, dropping to forty-six the following week, and falling out the chart. On 3 January 1999, the album re-entered at forty-one and stayed in the charts for four weeks. As a conjunction, &quot;Intimate and Live&quot; and Minogue&#x27;s 2007 live album &quot;&quot; are her highest charting live albums and her only live albums to chart in Australia. The DVD version peaked at number one in Australia and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) with shipments of 15,000 units.

<doc id="617736" wikidata="Q57619" url="?curid=617736" title="Frank Wedekind">
<text>Benjamin Franklin Wedekind (July 24, 1864 – March 9, 1918) was a German playwright. His work, which often criticizes bourgeois attitudes (particularly towards sex), is considered to anticipate expressionism and was influential in the development of epic theatre.

In the English-speaking world, before 2006 Wedekind was best known for the &quot;Lulu&quot; cycle, a two-play series—&quot;Erdgeist&quot; (&quot;Earth Spirit&quot;, 1895) and &quot;Die Büchse der Pandora&quot; (&quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, 1904)—centered on a young dancer/adventuress of mysterious origin. In 2006 his earlier play &quot;Frühlings Erwachen&quot; (&quot;Spring Awakening&quot;, 1891) became well known because of a Broadway musical adaptation.

==Life and career==
Benjamin Franklin Wedekind was born on July 24, 1864, in Hanover, German Confederation, Große Aegidienstraße 13 (today: Friedrichswall 10). His mother was Swiss and became pregnant with him in San Francisco. His father, a German, had a Swiss castle in which Wedekind grew up, after the family had left Hanover in 1872. Until World War I, when he was forced to obtain a German passport, he was an American citizen and traveled throughout Europe. He lived most of his adult life in Munich, though he had a brief period working in advertising, for the Maggi soup firm, in Switzerland in 1886.

Having worked in business and the circus, Wedekind went on to become an actor and singer. In this capacity, he received wide acclaim as the principal star of the satirical cabaret &quot;Die elf Scharfrichter&quot; (&quot;The Eleven Executioners&quot;), launched in 1901. Wedekind became an important influence on the tradition of German satirical writing for the theatre, paving the way for the cabaret-song satirists Kurt Tucholsky, Walter Mehring, Joachim Ringelnatz and Erich Kästner among others, who after Wedekind&#x27;s death would invigorate the culture of the Weimar Republic; &quot;all bitter social critics who used direct, stinging satire as the best means of attack and wrote a large part of their always intelligible light verse to be declaimed or sung&quot;. At the age of 34, after serving a nine-month prison sentence for &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; (thanks to the publication in &quot;Simplicissimus&quot; of some of his satirical poems), Wedekind became a dramaturg (a play-reader and adapter) at the Munich Schauspielhaus.

His sex life was promiscuous and he frequented prostitutes, contracting syphilis. He also enjoyed the pleasure of platonic female company and kept his tendencies toward homosexuality and sadism in check. He had an affair with Frida Uhl, the wife of playwright August Strindberg, who bore him a child, the Swedish-Austrian journalist and author Friedrich Strindberg. In 1906, he married the Austrian actress Tilly Newes, 22 years his junior and became strictly monogamous. His relationship with his wife was turbulent: Wedekind was prone to jealousy and felt pressure to maintain strenuous creative and sexual activity in order to please her. They had two daughters, Pamela and Kadidja, but his jealousy led his wife to attempt both separation and suicide.

Near the end of his life, Wedekind underwent an appendectomy and immediately began acting again, leading to a hernia. His doctor refused to operate immediately but Wedekind insisted and complications from the surgery led to his death at the age of 53 on March 9, 1918.

Tilly Wedekind went on to appear in such films as &quot;Travelling People&quot; and was romantically linked to the author Gottfried Benn. In 1969, at age 83, she published an autobiography in German, &quot;Lulu: Die Rolle meines Lebens&quot; (&quot;Lulu: The Role of My Life&quot;).

Wedekind&#x27;s great-grandson was the English writer Douglas Adams.

==Works==
Wedekind&#x27;s first major play, &quot;Frühlings Erwachen&quot; (&quot;Spring Awakening&quot;, 1891), which concerns sexuality and puberty among some young German students, caused a scandal, because it contained scenes of homoeroticism, implied group male masturbation, actual male masturbation, sado-masochism between a teenage boy and girl, rape and suicide, as well as references to abortion.

The &quot;Lulu&quot; plays &quot;Erdgeist&quot; (&quot;Earth Spirit&quot;, 1895) and &quot;Die Büchse der Pandora&quot; (&quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, 1904) were probably his best-known works until the 2006 adaptation of &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;. Originally conceived as a single play, the two pieces tell a continuous story of a sexually enticing young dancer who rises in society through her relationships with wealthy men but who later falls into poverty and prostitution. The frank depiction of sexuality and violence in these plays, including lesbianism and an encounter with Jack the Ripper (a role that Wedekind played in the original production), pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable on the stage at the time. Karl Kraus helped Wedekind stage it in Vienna.

&quot;Der Kammersänger&quot; (&quot;The Court-Singer&quot;, 1899) is a one-act character study of a famous opera singer who receives a series of unwelcome guests at his hotel suite.

In &quot;Franziska&quot; (1910), the title character, a young girl, initiates a Faustian pact with the Devil, selling her soul for the knowledge of what it is like to live life as a man (reasoning that men seem to have all the advantages).

A number of Wedekind&#x27;s works have been translated into English by Samuel Atkins Eliot Jr.

==Adaptations==

The &quot;Lulu&quot; plays formed the basis for G. W. Pabst&#x27;s acclaimed silent film &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; (1929), starring Louise Brooks as Lulu, and also Alban Berg&#x27;s opera &quot;Lulu&quot; (1937), which is considered to be one of the masterpieces of twentieth-century opera. Walerian Borowczyk based his 1980 film &quot;Lulu&quot; on these plays. The plays were adapted into comic books by John Linton Roberson, published in 2013 and 2020. They also form the basis for the 2011 album &quot;Lulu&quot;, a collaboration between the rock musician Lou Reed and the heavy metal band Metallica.

&quot;Hidalla&quot; was used as a source for a libretto by Franz Schreker, intended to be set by Alexander von Zemlinsky, but later set by Schreker himself in 1915 as the opera &quot;Die Gezeichneten&quot;.

&quot;Der Kammersänger&quot; was adapted by composer Hugo Weisgall for his English-language opera &quot;The Tenor&quot;.

Wedekind&#x27;s symbolist novella &quot;Mine-Haha, or On the Bodily Education of Young Girls&quot; (1903) was the basis for the films &quot;Innocence&quot; (2004) by Lucile Hadžihalilović and &quot;The Fine Art of Love&quot; (2005) by John Irvin.

In 2006, &quot;Frühlings Erwachen&quot; was adapted into the successful Broadway musical &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;.

<text>The prime minister of Angola was a high government official in Angola re-established by Angola&#x27;s 1992 constitution with limited powers as head of government.

Along with the rest of the Council of Ministers, the prime minister was appointed by the president. The position was originally created when Angola achieved independence from Portugal on 11 November 1975, but was abolished in 1978 when President Agostinho Neto consolidated his power. There was no prime minister until 1991, when President José Eduardo dos Santos reinstated the position following a peace agreement with the opposition party. The post was also vacant between 1999 and 2002.

The post was again abolished due to the 2010 Constitution of Angola, which integrates the functions of the prime minister into the office of the president, who is not subjected to the confidence of the parliamentary majority, contrarily to the prime minister.

<doc id="617742" wikidata="Q1091989" url="?curid=617742" title="Octave Feuillet">
<text>Octave Feuillet (11 July 1821 – 29 December 1890) was a French novelist and dramatist. His work stands midway between the romanticists and the realists. He is renowned for his &quot;distinguished and lucid portraiture of life&quot;, depictions of female characters, analyses of characters&#x27; psychologies and feelings, and his reserved but witty prose style. His most popular work remains his 1858 novel &quot;Le Roman d&#x27;un jeune homme pauvre&quot; (&quot;The Story of a Poor Young Man&quot;), which has been adapted for film many times by Italian, French, and Argentinian directors.

== Biography==
Feuillet was born at Saint-Lô, Manche (Normandy). His father, Jacques Feuillet, was a prominent lawyer and Secretary-General of La Manche, but also a hypersensitive invalid. His mother died when he was an infant. Feuillet inherited some of his father&#x27;s nervous excitability, though not to the same degree. He was sent to Lycée Louis-le Grand in Paris, where he achieved high distinction, assuring him of a good post in the diplomatic service.

In 1840 he rejected his father&#x27;s longtime wish that he be a diplomat and told him he planned to be a writer instead. His father disowned him. Octave Feuillet returned to Paris and lived as best he could by becoming a journalist. He collaborated with Paul Bocage on the plays &quot;Echec et mat,&quot; &quot;Palma, ou la nuit de Vendredi saint,&quot; and &quot;La Vieillesse de Richelieu&quot;. His father forgave him three years later and granted him an allowance, giving him a comfortable existence while he remained in the capital. There he wrote his first novels and got them published.

Jacques Feuillet&#x27;s health declined further, and he summoned his son to care for him at Saint-Lô. It was a real sacrifice to leave Paris and the outlet it gave Octave Feuillet for his career, but he obeyed. His father&#x27;s mania for solitude and tyrannical temper made life in Saint-Lô very stressful. However, in 1851, Octave married his cousin Valérie Feuillet (née Dubois), who was also a writer. During what he considered his &quot;exile&quot; in Saint-Lô, Feuillet produced some of his best work. His first major success came in 1852, when he published the novel &quot;Bellah&quot; and produced the comedy &quot;La Crise&quot;. Both were reprinted from the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;, where many of his later novels also appeared. Other acclaimed works written in Saint-Lô were &quot;La Petite Comtesse&quot; (1857), &quot;Dalila&quot; (1857), and the popular &quot;Le Roman d&#x27;un jeune homme pauvre&quot; (1858).

Seemingly repeating his father&#x27;s life, Feuillet himself grew ill at Saint-Lô with a more severe nervous condition, but his wife and mother-in-law helped sustain him. In 1857, he was able to return to Paris for a brief period to oversee the rehearsal of a play he had adapted from his novel &quot;Dalila.&quot; The following year, he did the same when &quot;Un jeune homme pauvre&quot; was rehearsing. While he was in the capital, his father died.

Feuillet and his family immediately moved to Paris, where he became a favorite at the court of the Second Empire. His pieces were performed at Compiègne before they were given to the public, and on one occasion the Empress Eugénie played the part of Madame de Pons in &quot;Les Portraits de la Marquise&quot;.

In 1862 he achieved another great success with his novel &quot;Sibylle&quot;. His health, however, had begun to decline, further impacted by the death of his eldest son. He returned to the quiet of Normandy but not to the Feuillet family chateau, which had been sold years earlier. He bought a house called Les Paillers in the suburbs of Saint-Lô, where he lived, hidden among the numerous rosebushes and their blooms that obsessed him, for fifteen years.

== Honors, final years, and death ==

In 1862, Feuillet was elected to the Académie française. Two years later he was made librarian of Fontainebleau Palace, where he had to live for a month or two each year to get the stipend accompanying the position.

In 1867 he produced his masterpiece, &quot;Monsieur de Camors&quot;, and in 1872 he wrote &quot;Julia de Trécœur&quot;. 1886 saw the publication of &quot;La Morte&quot;, to which influential literary critic Walter Pater devoted a chapter of praise and analysis in his 1889 essay collection, &quot;Appreciations&quot;. After the sale of Les Paillers, Feuillet spent his last years as a nomad owing to depression and other health problems. Not long after the publication of his final book, &quot;Honneur d&#x27;artiste&quot;, he died in Paris on 29 December 1890.

<doc id="617744" wikidata="Q30007" url="?curid=617744" title="Extremaduran language">
<text>Extremaduran ( , ) is a group of vernacular Romance dialects, related to the Asturleonese language, spoken in Extremadura and adjoining areas in the province of Salamanca. It is difficult to establish the exact boundary between Extremaduran and the Spanish varieties spoken in most of Extremadura.

== Dialects ==
The linguistic varieties of Extremadura are usually classified in three main branches: Northern or &quot;High&quot; (&quot;artu estremeñu&quot;), Central or &quot;Middle&quot; (), and Southern or &quot;Low&quot; (). The northern branch is usually considered to be the language proper, and is spoken in the north-west of the autonomous region of Extremadura, and the south-west of Salamanca, a province of the autonomous region of Castile and León. The central and southern branches are spoken in the rest of Extremadura, and are not different enough from standard Spanish to be considered anything but dialects of the language, since at least the 18th century.

Northern Extremaduran is also spoken in a few villages of southern Salamanca, being known there as the &quot;palra d&#x27;El Rebollal&quot;, which is now almost extinct.

== History ==
The late 19th century saw the first serious attempt to write in Extremaduran, until then an oral language, with the poet José María Gabriel y Galán. Born in Salamanca, he lived most of his life in the north of Cáceres, Extremadura. He wrote in a local variant of Extremaduran, full of dialectal remains, but always with an eye on Spanish usage.

After that, localisms are the pattern in the attempts to defend the Extremaduran language to the extent that today only a few people are trying to revive the language and make northern Extremadura a bilingual region, whereas the government and official institutions seem to think the best solution is for northwestern Extremadurans to speak a Castilian dialect without any kind of protection.

There are also attempts to transform the southern Castilian dialects (&quot;castúo&quot;, as some people named them using the word which appeared in Luis Chamizo Trigueros&#x27;s poems) into a language, which makes it even harder to defend High Extremaduran, considered more frequently a &quot;real&quot; language and makes it easier for the administration to reject co-officiality and the normalisation of Extremaduran.
It is in serious danger of extinction, with only the oldest people speaking it at present, while most of the Extremaduran population cannot speak the language, since the majority of Extremadurans, and even its own speakers, regard it as poorly spoken Spanish.

In 2013, the people of Serradilla created the first feature film in Extremaduran, &quot;Territoriu de bandolerus&quot;.

== Phonology ==

* Features related to Astur-Leonese:
** Post-tonic &quot;o&quot; becomes &quot;u&quot;, e.g. &quot;oru&quot; &#x27;gold&#x27;.
** Post-tonic &quot;e&quot; becomes &quot;i&quot;, e.g. &quot;calli&quot; or &#x27;street&#x27;.
** Latin word-final &quot;e&quot;, chiefly after &quot;d&quot;, is not lost, e.g. &quot;redi&quot; &#x27;net&#x27;.
** Some cases of palatalization of word-initial &quot;n&quot;, e.g. &quot;ñíu&quot; &#x27;nest&#x27;.
** Conservation of the consonantic group &quot;mb&quot; in intermediate position, e.g. &quot;lambel&quot; &#x27;to lick&#x27;.
** Frequent conservation of word-initial derived from a Latin &quot;f-&quot;. This consonant is lost in most Spanish varieties, but is common with much of Andalusia, e.g. &#x27;fig&#x27;.
** Occasional conservation of word-initial &quot;f&quot;, e.g. &#x27;home, hearth&#x27;.
* Features related to southern peninsular Spanish:
** General loss of intervocalic &quot;d&quot;, e.g. &#x27;fear&#x27;.
** Debuccalization of post-vocalic , and into (&quot;s-aspiration&quot;), e.g. &quot;estal&quot; &#x27;to be&#x27;.
* Other features:
** Infinitives in &quot;-l&quot;, e.g. &quot;dil&quot; &#x27;to go&#x27;.
** Metathesis of the consonant cluster &quot;rl&quot; into &quot;lr&quot;, e.g. &#x27;to talk&#x27;.
** Occasional interchange of the liquid consonants &quot;l/r&quot;, e.g. &#x27;clear&#x27;.
** Preservation of some old voiced fricatives, such as some instances of corresponding to in Portuguese or corresponding to in Portuguese (both corresponding to /θ/ in Spanish). This feature is an archaism preserved from Old Spanish or Old Astur-Leonese, as it happens only when it is etymologically justified. When a voiced fricative appears, one also does in languages such as Catalan or Portuguese: Extremaduran &quot;tristeza&quot; &#x27;sadness&#x27; (still voiced in Portuguese &quot;tristeza&quot; , voice lost in Spanish &quot;tristeza&quot; ), but Extremaduran &quot;cabeça&quot; &#x27;head&#x27; (voiceless also in Portuguese &quot;cabeça&quot; , Spanish &quot;cabeza&quot; ). The feature is dying out quite fast but is found all over the High Extremaduran speaking area.

==Morphology==

* Anteposition of the article before the possessive pronoun, as in Old Spanish or in many Romance languages such as Leonese, Portuguese, Catalan or Italian.
* Anteposition of the particle &quot;lu&quot; (or &quot;lo&quot;), in some interrogative sentences.
* Use of diminutives &quot;inu&quot; and &quot;ina&quot;, as heritage from Leonese (as in Portuguese).
* Occasional formation of gerund, derived from a form of the verb in past tense.
* Usage of a vocative-exclamative case. When nouns are in the vocative, the closing of post-tonic vowels (&quot;e&quot; into &quot;i&quot; and &quot;o&quot; into &quot;u&quot;) disappears and those vowels open. (Ramiro wants to come), but &quot;Ramiro, ven pacá&quot; (Ramiro, come here!). &quot;Sé quién lo vidu, Pepi&quot; (I know who saw it, &quot;Pepe did&quot;), but &quot;Sé quién lo vidu, Pepe&quot; (I know who saw it, &quot;Pepe&quot;). This is a characteristic shared with the Fala language. Extremaduran and the Fala language are actually the only western Romance languages with a distinct form of vocative case for nouns formed with a change in the ending.
* Usage of the preposition &quot;a&quot; with the verbs &quot;andal&quot; and &quot;estal&quot; indicating static temporal location, contrasting with the usage of &quot;en&quot;. &quot;Está a Caçris&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s in Cáceres (for a few days)&quot;, &quot;Está en Caçris&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s in Cáceres&quot;, &quot;Está pa Caçris&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s around Cáceres&quot;.
* A very frequent usage of deictic forms to which enclitic pronouns can be added at the end. They can be used in the middle of a sentence: &quot;Velaquí&quot; la mi casa (Here is my house), &quot;velallilu&quot; (there he is), &quot;velaquí&quot; lechugas, millu... (Look, lettuce, corn and so on is grown here).
* Usage of reduplicated forms of plural pronouns with a reciprocal sense (&quot;ellus y ellus&quot;, &quot;vujotrus y vujotrus&quot;...): &quot;Estaban brucheandu ellus y ellus&quot;: They were wrestling with each other.

== Vocabulary ==

* Usage of terms considered in Spanish as archaisms: &quot;ludia&quot; (Spanish &quot;levadura&quot;, &quot;yeast&quot;).
* Presence of common terms from Andalusian Arabic: &quot;zagal&quot; (from Andalusian Arabic &quot;zaḡál&quot;, &quot;boy&quot;).

==Comparative tables==

* The words in this table refer only to High Extremaduran.

** Extremaduran words in this table are spelled according to Ismael Carmona García&#x27;s orthography.

==Organizations==
There is a regional organization in Extremadura, OSCEC Estremaúra, that tries to defend the language, one journal (Belsana) and one cultural newspaper, Iventia, written in the new unified Extremaduran and the old dialect &quot;palra d&#x27;El Rebollal&quot;.

<doc id="617745" wikidata="Q482407" url="?curid=617745" title="1954 Geneva Conference">
<text>The Geneva Conference was intended to settle outstanding issues resulting from the Korean War and the First Indochina War and involved several nations. It took place in Geneva, Switzerland, from 26 April to 20 July 1954. The part of the conference on the Korean question ended without adopting any declarations or proposals and so is generally considered less relevant. On the other hand, the Geneva Accords that dealt with the dismantling of French Indochina proved to have long-lasting repercussions. The crumbling of the French colonial empire in Southeast Asia led to the formation of the states of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), the State of Vietnam (precursor of the future Republic of Vietnam, or South Vietnam), the Kingdom of Cambodia, and the Kingdom of Laos. Three agreements about French Indochina, covering Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, were signed on 21 July 1954 and took effect two days later.

Diplomats from South Korea, North Korea, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and the United States dealt with the Korean side of the conference. For the Indochina side, the Accords were between France, the Viet Minh, the Soviet Union, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the future states being made from French Indochina.
The agreement temporarily separated Vietnam into two zones: a northern zone to be governed by the Viet Minh and a southern zone to be governed by the State of Vietnam, which was headed by former Nguyễn dynasty emperor Bảo Đại. A Conference Final Declaration, which was issued by the British chairman of the conference, provided that a general election be held by July 1956 to create a unified Vietnamese state. Despite helping create some of the agreements, they were not directly signed or accepted by delegates of the State of Vietnam and the United States. After a military buildup in North Vietnam, the State of Vietnam, under Ngo Dinh Diem, subsequently withdrew from the proposed elections. Worsening relations between the North and South would eventually lead to the Vietnam War.

==Background==
On 18 February 1954, at the Berlin Conference, participants agreed that &quot;the problem of restoring peace in Indochina will also be discussed at the Conference [on the Korean question] to which representatives of the United States, France, the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Chinese People&#x27;s Republic and other interested states will be invited.&quot;

The conference was held at the Palace of Nations in Geneva, commencing on 26 April 1954. The first agenda item was the Korean question to be followed by Indochina.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
&quot;China&#x27;s belligerent policies in Korea and Indochina&quot;, coupled with their increasing diplomatic closeness to the Soviet Union, would actively make China&#x27;s international presence rather isolated. Fearing further isolation from the emerging de-colonized world, and also a possible American intervention into Indochina, the PRC&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Ministry (led by Zhou Enlai) would go into the conference with the key objective of breaking the US embargo of China and preventing American military intervention. Moreover, Zhou also stressed adopting a more &quot;realistic&quot; and moderate attitude which could deliver tangible results to the Indochina problem.

===Korea===

The armistice signed at the end of the Korean War required a political conference within three months—a timeline which was not met—&quot;to settle through negotiation the questions of the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea, the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, etc.&quot;

===Indochina===

As decolonization took place in Asia, France had to relinquish its power over Indochina (Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam). While Laos and Cambodia were both given independence, France chose to stay in Vietnam. This ended with a war between French troops and the Vietnamese nationalists led by Ho Chi Minh. The latter&#x27;s army, the Viet Minh, fought a guerrilla war against the French, who relied on Western technology. After a series of offensives, gradually whittling away at French held territory between 1950 and 1954, hostilities culminated in a decisive defeat for the French at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. This resulted in a French withdrawal and the Geneva conference.

It was decided that Vietnam would be divided at the 17th parallel until 1956 when democratic elections would be held under international supervision and auspices. All parties involved agreed to this (Ho Chi Minh had strong support in the north, which was more populous than the south, and was thus confident that he would win an election), except for the U.S., which, in the spirit of the Cold War, feared seeing communism spreading in a domino effect throughout Asia as written in a National Intelligence Estimate dated 3 August 1954.

==Korea==
The South Korean representative proposed that the South Korean government was the only legal government in Korea, that UN-supervised elections should be held in the North, that Chinese forces should withdraw, and that UN forces, a belligerent party in the war, should remain as a police force. The North Korean representative suggested that elections be held throughout all of Korea, that all foreign forces leave beforehand, that the elections be run by an all-Korean Commission to be made up of equal parts from North and South Korea, and to increase general relations economically and culturally between the North and the South.

The Chinese delegation proposed an amendment to have a group of &#x27;neutral&#x27; nations supervise the elections, which the North accepted. The U.S. supported the South Korean position, saying that the USSR wanted to turn North Korea into a puppet state. Most allies remained silent and at least one, Britain, thought that the South Korean–U.S. proposal would be deemed unreasonable.

The South Korean representative proposed that all-Korea elections, be held according to South Korean constitutional procedures and still under UN supervision. On June 15, the last day of the conference on the Korean question, the USSR and China both submitted declarations in support of a unified, democratic, independent Korea, saying that negotiations to that end should resume at an appropriate time. The Belgian and British delegations said that while they were not going to accept &quot;the Soviet and Chinese proposals, that did not mean a rejection of the ideas they contained&quot;. In the end, however, the conference participants did not agree on any declaration.

==Indochina==
While the delegates began to assemble in Geneva in late April, the discussions on Indochina did not begin until 8 May 1954. The Viet Minh had achieved their decisive victory over the French Union forces at Dien Bien Phu the previous day.

The Western allies did not have a unified position on what the Conference was to achieve in relation to Indochina. Anthony Eden, leading the British delegation, favored a negotiated settlement to the conflict. Georges Bidault, leading the French delegation, vacillated and was keen to preserve something of France&#x27;s position in Indochina to justify past sacrifices, even as the nation&#x27;s military situation deteriorated. The U.S. had been supporting the French in Indochina for many years and the Republican Eisenhower administration wanted to ensure that it could not be accused of another &quot;Yalta&quot; or of having &quot;lost&quot; Indochina to the Communists. Its leaders had previously accused the Democratic Truman administration of having &quot;lost China&quot; when the Communists were successful in securing control of virtually all of the country.

The Eisenhower administration had considered air strikes in support of the French at Dien Bien Phu but was unable to obtain a commitment to united action from key allies such as the United Kingdom. Eisenhower was wary of becoming drawn into &quot;another Korea&quot; that would be deeply unpopular with the American public. U.S. domestic policy considerations strongly influenced the country&#x27;s position at Geneva. Columnist Walter Lippmann wrote on 29 April that &quot;the American position at Geneva is an impossible one, so long as leading Republican senators have no terms for peace except unconditional surrender of the enemy and no terms for entering the war except as a collective action in which nobody is now willing to engage.&quot; At the time of the conference, the U.S. did not recognize the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, an anticommunist, forbade any contact with the Chinese delegation, refusing to shake hands with Zhou Enlai, the lead Chinese negotiator.

Dulles fell out with the UK delegate Anthony Eden over the perceived failure of the UK to support united action and U.S. positions on Indochina; he left Geneva on 3 May and was replaced by his deputy Walter Bedell Smith. The State of Vietnam refused to attend the negotiations until Bidault wrote to Bảo Đại, assuring him that any agreement would not partition Vietnam.

Bidault opened the conference on 8 May by proposing a cessation of hostilities, a ceasefire in place, a release of prisoners of war, and a disarming of irregulars, despite the French surrender at Dien Bien Phu the previous day in northwestern Vietnam.

On 10 May, Phạm Văn Đồng, the leader of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) delegation set out their position, proposing a ceasefire; separation of the opposing forces; a ban on the introduction of new forces into Indochina; the exchange of prisoners; independence and sovereignty for Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos; elections for unified governments in each country, the withdrawal of all foreign forces; and the inclusion of the Pathet Lao and Khmer Issarak representatives at the Conference. Pham Van Dong first proposed a temporary partition of Vietnam on 25 May. Following their victory at Dien Bien Phu and given the worsening French security position around the Red River Delta, a ceasefire and partition would not appear to have been in the interests of the DRV. It appears that the DRV leadership thought the balance of forces was uncomfortably close and was worried about morale problems in the troops and supporters, after eight years of war. Robert F. Turner has argued that the Viet Minh might have prolonged the negotiations and continued fighting to achieve a more favorable position militarily, if not for Chinese and Soviet pressure on them to end the fighting. In addition, there was a widespread perception that the Diem government would collapse, leaving the Viet Minh free to take control of the area.

On 12 May, the State of Vietnam rejected any partition of the country, and the U.S. expressed a similar position the next day. The French sought to implement a physical separation of the opposing forces into enclaves throughout the country, known as the &quot;leopard-skin&quot; approach. The DRV/Viet Minh would be given the Cà Mau Peninsula, three enclaves near Saigon, large areas of Annam and Tonkin; the French Union forces would retain most urban areas and the Red River Delta, including Hanoi and Haiphong, allowing it to resume combat operation in the north, if necessary.

Behind the scenes, the U.S. and the French governments continued to discuss the terms for possible U.S. military intervention in Indochina. By 29 May, the U.S. and the French had reached an agreement that if the Conference failed to deliver an acceptable peace deal, Eisenhower would seek Congressional approval for military intervention in Indochina. However, after discussions with the Australian and New Zealand governments in which it became evident that neither would support U.S. military intervention, reports of the plummeting morale among the French Union forces and opposition from U.S. Army Chief of Staff Matthew Ridgway, the U.S. began to shift away from intervention and continued to oppose a negotiated settlement. By early to mid-June, the U.S. began to consider the possibility that rather than supporting the French in Indochina, it might be preferable for the French to leave and for the U.S. to support the new Indochinese states. That would remove the taint of French colonialism. Unwilling to support the proposed partition or intervention, by mid-June, the U.S. decided to withdraw from major participation in the Conference.

On 15 June, Vyacheslav Molotov proposed that the ceasefire should be monitored by a supervisory commission, chaired by non-aligned India. On 16 June, Zhou Enlai stated that the situations in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos were not the same and should be treated separately. He proposed that Laos and Cambodia could be treated as neutral nations if they had no foreign bases. On 18 June, Pham Van Dong said the Viet Minh would be prepared to withdraw their forces from Laos and Cambodia if no foreign bases were established in Indochina. The apparent softening of the Communist position appeared to arise from a meeting among the DRV, Chinese and Soviet delegations on 15 June in which Zhou warned the Viet Minh that its military presence in Laos and Cambodia threatened to undermine negotiations in relation to Vietnam. That represented a major blow to the DRV, which had tried to ensure that the Pathet Lao and Khmer Issarak would join the governments in Laos and Cambodia, respectively, under the leadership of the DRV. The Chinese likely also sought to ensure that Laos and Cambodia were not under Vietnam&#x27;s influence in the future but under China&#x27;s.

On 18 June, following a vote of no-confidence, the French Laniel government fell and was replaced by a coalition with Radical Pierre Mendès France as Prime Minister, by a vote of 419 to 47, with 143 abstentions. Prior to the collapse of the Laniel government, France recognized Vietnam as &quot;a fully independent and sovereign state&quot; on 4 June. A long-time opponent of the war, Mendès France had pledged to the National Assembly that he would resign if he failed to achieve a ceasefire within 30 days. Mendès France retained the Foreign Ministry for himself, and Bidault left the Conference. The new French government abandoned earlier assurances to the State of Vietnam that France would not pursue or accept partition, and it engaged in secret negotiations with the Viet Minh delegation, bypassing the State of Vietnam to meet Mendès France&#x27;s self-imposed deadline. On 23 June, Mendès France secretly met with Zhou Enlai at the French embassy in Bern. Zhou outlined the Chinese position that an immediate ceasefire was required, the three nations should be treated separately, and the two governments that existed in Vietnam would be recognized.

Mendès France returned to Paris. The following day he met with his main advisers on Indochina. General Paul Ély outlined the deteriorating military position in Vietnam, and suggested that the situation on the ground called for partition at the 16th or 17th parallel. The three agreed that the Bao Dai government would need time to consolidate its position and that U.S. assistance would be vital. The possibility of retaining Hanoi and Haiphong or just Haiphong was dismissed, as the French believed it was preferable to seek partition with no Viet Minh enclaves in the south.

On 16 June, twelve days after France granted full independence to the State of Vietnam, Bao Dai appointed Ngo Dinh Diem as Prime Minister to replace Bửu Lộc. Diem was a staunch nationalist, both anti-French and anticommunist, with strong political connections in the U.S. Diem agreed to take the position if he received all civilian and military powers. Diem and his foreign minister, Tran Van Do, were strongly opposed to partition.

At Geneva, the State of Vietnam&#x27;s proposal included &quot;a ceasefire without a demarcation line&quot; and &quot;control by the United Nations... of the administration of the entire country [and] of the general elections, when the United Nations believes that order and security will have been everywhere truly restored.&quot;

On 28 June following an Anglo-US summit in Washington, the UK and the U.S. issued a joint communique, which included a statement that if the Conference failed, &quot;the international situation will be seriously aggravated.&quot; The parties also agreed to a secret list of seven minimum outcomes that both parties would &quot;respect&quot;: the preservation of a noncommunist South Vietnam (plus an enclave in the Red River Delta if possible), future reunification of divided Vietnam, and the integrity of Cambodia and Laos, including the removal of all Viet Minh forces.

Also on 28 June, Tạ Quang Bửu, a senior DRV negotiator, called for the line of partition to be at the 13th parallel, the withdrawal of all French Union forces from the north within three months of the ceasefire, and the Pathet Lao to have virtual sovereignty over eastern Laos.

From 3 to 5 July, Zhou Enlai met with Ho Chi Minh and other senior DRV leaders in Liuzhou, Guangxi. Most of the first day was spent discussing the military situation and balance of forces in Vietnam, Giáp explained that while
Dien Bien Phu had represented a colossal defeat for France ... she was far from defeated. She retained a superiority in numbers—some 470,000 troops, roughly half of them Vietnamese, versus 310,000 on the Viet Minh side as well as control of Vietnam&#x27;s major cities (Hanoi, Saigon, Huế, Tourane (Da Nang)). A fundamental alteration of the balance of forces had thus yet to occur, Giap continued, despite Dien Bien Phu.

Wei Guoqing, the chief Chinese military adviser to the Viet Minh, said he agreed. &quot;If the U.S. does not interfere,&#x27; Zhou asked, &quot;and assuming France will dispatch more troops, how long will it take for us to seize the whole of Indochina?&quot; In the best scenario, Giap replied, &quot;full victory could be achieved in two to three years. Worst case? Three to five years.&quot;

That afternoon Zhou &quot;offered a lengthy exposition on the massive international reach of the Indochina conflict ... and on the imperative of preventing an American intervention in the war. Given Washington&#x27;s intense hostility to the Chinese Revolution ... one must assume that the current administration would not stand idly by if the Viet Minh sought to win complete victory.&quot; Consequently, &quot;if we ask too much at Geneva and peace is not achieved, it is certain that the U.S. will intervene, providing Cambodia, Laos, and Bao Dai with weapons and ammunition, helping them train military personnel, and establishing military bases there ... The central issue&quot;, Zhou told Ho, is &quot;to prevent America&#x27;s intervention&quot; and &quot;to achieve a peaceful settlement.&quot; Laos and Cambodia would have to be treated differently and be allowed to pursue their own paths if they did not join a military alliance or permit foreign bases on their territory. The Mendes France government, having vowed to achieve a negotiated solution, must be supported, for fear that it would fall and be replaced by one committed to continuing the war.&quot; Ho pressed hard for the partition line to be at the 16th parallel while Zhou noted that Route 9, the only land route from Laos to the South China Sea ran closer to the 17th parallel.

Several days later the Communist Party of Vietnam&#x27;s Sixth Central Committee plenum took place. Ho Chi Minh and General Secretary Trường Chinh took turns Emphasizing the need for an early political settlement to prevent military intervention by the United States, now the &quot;main and direct enemy&quot; of Vietnam. &quot;In the new situation we cannot follow the old program,&quot; Ho declared. &quot;[B]efore, our motto was, &#x27;war of resistance until victory.&#x27; Now, in view of the new situation, we should uphold a new motto: peace, unification, independence, and democracy.&quot; A spirit of compromise would be required by both sides to make the negotiations succeed, and there could be no more talk of wiping out and annihilating all the French troops. A demarcation line allowing the temporary regrouping of both sides would be necessary ...&quot; The plenum endorsed Ho&#x27;s analysis, passing a resolution supporting a compromise settlement to end the fighting. However, Ho and Truong Chinh plainly worried that following such an agreement in Geneva, there would be internal discontent and &quot;leftist deviation&quot;, and in particular, analysts would fail to see the complexity of the situation and underestimate the power of the American and French adversaries. They accordingly reminded their colleagues that France would retain control of a large part of the country and that people living in the area might be confused, alienated, and vulnerable to enemy manipulations.
&quot;We have to make it clear to our people,&quot; Ho said that &quot;in the interest of the whole country, for the sake of long-term interest, they must accept this, because it is a glorious thing and the whole country is grateful for that. We must not let people have pessimistic and negative thinking; instead, we must encourage the people to continue the struggle for the withdrawal of French troops and ensure our independence.&quot;

The Conference reconvened on 10 July, and Mendès France arrived to lead the French delegation. The State of Vietnam continued to protest against partition which had become inevitable, with the only issue being where the line should be drawn. Walter Bedell Smith from the U.S. arrived in Geneva on 16 July, but the U.S. delegation was under instructions to avoid direct association with the negotiations.

All parties at the Conference called for reunification elections but could not agree on the details. Pham Van Dong proposed elections under the supervision of &quot;local commissions.&quot; The U.S., with the support of Britain and the Associated States of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, suggested UN supervision. That was rejected by Molotov, who argued for a commission with an equal number of communist and noncommunist members, which could determine &quot;important&quot; issues only by unanimous agreement. The negotiators were unable to agree on a date for the elections for reunification. The DRV argued that the elections should be held within six months of the ceasefire, and the Western allies sought to have no deadline. Molotov proposed June 1955 then softened to later in 1955 and finally July 1956. The Diem government supported reunification elections but only with effective international supervision; it argued that genuinely free elections were impossible in the totalitarian North.
By the afternoon of 20 July, the remaining outstanding issues were resolved as the parties agreed that the partition line should be at the 17th parallel and that the elections for reunification should be in July 1956, two years after the ceasefire. The &quot;Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam&quot; was signed only by French and Viet Minh military commands. Based on a proposal by Zhou Enlai, an International Control Commission (ICC) chaired by India, with Canada and Poland as members, was placed in charge of supervising the ceasefire. Because issues were to be decided unanimously, Poland&#x27;s presence in the ICC provided the communists&#x27; effective veto power over supervision of the treaty. The unsigned &quot;Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference&quot; called for reunification elections, which the majority of delegates expected to be supervised by the ICC. The Viet Minh never accepted ICC authority over such elections, stating that the ICC&#x27;s &quot;competence was to be limited to the supervision and control of the implementation of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities by both parties.&quot; Of the nine delegates present, only the United States and the State of Vietnam refused to accept the declaration. Bedell Smith delivered a &quot;unilateral declaration&quot; of the U.S. position, reiterating: &quot;We shall seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to insure that they are conducted fairly.&quot;

While the three agreements (later known as the Geneva Accords) were dated 20 July (to meet Mendès France&#x27;s 30-day deadline) they were in fact signed on the morning of 21 July.

== Provisions ==
The accords, which were issued on 21 July 1954 (taking effect two days later), set out the following terms in relation to Vietnam:
* a &quot;provisional military demarcation line&quot; running approximately along the 17th Parallel &quot;on either side of which the forces of the two parties shall be regrouped after their withdrawal&quot;.
* a demilitarized zone on each side of the demarcation line
* French Union forces regroup to the south of the line and Viet Minh to the north
* free movement of the population between the zone for three hundred days
* neither zone to join any military alliance or seek military reinforcement
* establishment of the International Control Commission, comprising Canada, Poland and India as chair, to monitor the ceasefire
* free general elections by secret ballot shall be held in July 1956, under the supervision of the International Supervisory Commission (it was recorded only in the unsigned Final Declaration of the Conference).

The agreement was signed by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, France, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. The State of Vietnam rejected the agreement, while the United States stated that it &quot;took note&quot; of the ceasefire agreements and declared that it would &quot;refrain from the threat or use of force to disturb them.

To put aside any notion specifically that the partition was permanent, an unsigned Final Declaration, stated in Article 6: &quot;The Conference recognizes that the essential purpose of the agreement relating to Vietnam is to settle military questions with a view to ending hostilities and that the military demarcation line is provisional and should not in any way be interpreted as constituting a political or territorial boundary.&quot;

Separate accords were signed by the signatories with the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Kingdom of Laos in relation to Cambodia and Laos respectively. Following the terms of the agreement, Laos would be governed by the Khao royal court while Cambodia would be ruled by the royal court of Norodom Sihanouk. Despite retaining its monarchy, the agreement also allowed for &quot;VWP-affiliated Laotian forces&quot; to run the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsal, further expanding North Vietnamese influence within Indochina. Communist forces in Cambodia, however, would remain out of power. 

The British and Communist Chinese delegations reached an agreement on the sidelines of the Conference to upgrade their diplomatic relations.

==Reactions==
The DRV at Geneva accepted a much worse settlement than the military situation on the ground indicated. &quot;For Ho Chi Minh, there was no getting around the fact that his victory, however unprecedented and stunning was incomplete and perhaps temporary. The vision that had always driven him on, that of a &#x27;great union&#x27; of all Vietnamese, had flickered into view for a fleeting moment in 1945–46, then had been lost in the subsequent war. Now, despite vanquishing the French military, the dream remained unrealized ...&quot; That was partly as a result of the great pressure exerted by China (Pham Van Dong is alleged to have said in one of the final negotiating sessions that Zhou Enlai double-crossed the DRV) and the Soviet Union for their own purposes, but the Viet Minh had their own reasons for agreeing to a negotiated settlement, principally their own concerns regarding the balance of forces and fear of U.S. intervention.

France had achieved a much better outcome than could have been expected. Bidault had stated at the beginning of the Conference that he was playing with &quot;a two of clubs and a three of diamonds&quot; whereas the DRV had several aces, kings, and queens, but Jean Chauvel was more circumspect: &quot;There is no good end to a bad business.&quot;

In a press conference on 21 July, US President Eisenhower expressed satisfaction that a ceasefire had been concluded but stated that the U.S. was not a party to the Accords or bound by them, as they contained provisions that his administration could not support.

==Aftermath==

On 9 October 1954, the tricolore was lowered for the last time at the Hanoi Citadel and the last French Union forces left the city, crossing the Paul Doumer Bridge on their way to Haiphong for embarkation.
For the communist forces, which were instrumental in the defeat of the French, the ideology of communism and nationalism were linked. Many communist sympathizers viewed the South Vietnamese as a French colonial remnant and later an American puppet regime. On the other hand, many others viewed the North Vietnamese as a puppet of International Communism.

After the cessation of hostilities, a large migration took place. North Vietnamese, especially Catholics, intellectuals, business people, land owners, anti-communist democrats, and members of the middle class moved south of the Accords-mandated ceasefire line during Operation Passage to Freedom. The ICC reported that at least 892,876 North Vietnamese were processed through official refugee stations, while journalists recounted that as many as 2 million more might have fled had it not been for the presence of Viet Minh soldiers, who frequently beat and occasionally killed those who refused to turn back. The CIA attempted to further influence Catholic Vietnamese with slogans such as &quot;the Virgin Mary is moving South&quot;. Around the same time, between 14,000 – 45,000 civilians and approximately 100,000 Viet Minh fighters moved in the opposite direction.

The U.S. replaced the French as a political backup for Ngo Dinh Diem, the Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam, who asserted his power in the South. The Geneva conference had not provided any specific mechanisms for the national elections planned for 1956, and Diem refused to hold them by citing that the South had not signed and was not bound to the Geneva Accords and that it was impossible to hold free elections in the communist North. Instead, he went about attempting to crush communist opposition.

On 20 May 1955, French Union forces withdrew from Saigon to a coastal base and on 28 April 1956, the last French forces left Vietnam.

North Vietnam violated the Geneva Accords by failing to withdraw all Viet Minh troops from South Vietnam, stifling the movement of North Vietnamese refugees, and conducting a military buildup that more than doubled the number of armed divisions in the North Vietnamese army while the South Vietnamese army was reduced by 20,000 men. U.S. military advisers continued to support the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, which was created as a replacement for the Vietnamese National Army.

In July 1955, the prime minister of the State of Vietnam, Ngô Đình Diệm, announced that South Vietnam would not participate in elections to unify the country. He said that the State of Vietnam had not signed the Geneva Accords and was therefore not bound by it, despite the State of Vietnam being part of the French Union, which was bound by the Accords. The failure of reunification led to the creation of the National Liberation Front (better known as the Viet Cong) by Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s government. They were closely aided by the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army (VPA) of the North, also known as the North Vietnamese Army. The result was the Vietnam War.

Despite glaring errors with the partition, the Chinese would still manage to largely benefit from the conference&#x27;s results. In addition to gaining an independent North Vietnam, China would also open up &quot;dialogues with France, Britain, and the United States&quot;. Furthermore, China, as a result of this expanded and moderate international approach, also helped to weaken America&#x27;s attempt to label China as a &quot;Red&quot; radical within the region. 

Historian John Lewis Gaddis said that the 1954 accords &quot;were so hastily drafted and ambiguously worded that, from the standpoint of international law, it makes little sense to speak of violations from either side&quot;.

<text>Henri Meilhac (; 23 February 1830 – 6 July 1897) was a French dramatist and opera librettist, best known for his collaborations with Ludovic Halévy on Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; and on the works of Jacques Offenbach, as well as Jules Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot;.

==Biography==
Meilhac was born in the 1st arrondissement of Paris in 1830. As a young man, he began writing fanciful articles for Parisian newspapers and comédies en vaudevilles, in a vivacious boulevardier spirit which brought him to the forefront. About 1860, Meilhac met Ludovic Halévy, and their collaboration for the stage lasted twenty years.

Their most famous collaboration is the libretto for Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;. However, Meilhac&#x27;s work is most closely tied to the music of Jacques Offenbach, for whom he wrote over a dozen librettos, most of them together with Halévy. The most successful collaborations with Offenbach are &quot;La belle Hélène&quot; (1864), &quot;Barbe-bleue&quot; (1866), &quot;La Vie parisienne&quot; (1866), &quot;La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein&quot; (1867), and &quot;La Périchole&quot; (1868).

Other librettos by Meilhac include Jules Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot; (with Philippe Gille) (1884), Hervé&#x27;s &quot;Mam&#x27;zelle Nitouche&quot; (1883), and &quot;Rip&quot;, the French version of Robert Planquette&#x27;s operetta &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; (also with Gille). Their vaudeville play &quot;Le réveillon&quot; was the basis of the operetta &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;.

In 1888, Meilhac was elected to the Académie française. He died in Paris in 1897.

<text>Julian David Cope (born 21 October 1957) is an English musician and author. He was the singer and songwriter in Liverpool post-punk band the Teardrop Explodes and has followed a solo career since 1983 in addition to working on musical side projects such as Queen Elizabeth, Brain Donor and Black Sheep.

Cope is also an author on Neolithic culture, publishing &quot;The Modern Antiquarian&quot; in 1998, and a political and cultural activist with a public interest in occultism and paganism. He has written two volumes of autobiography, &quot;Head-On&quot; (1994) and &quot;Repossessed&quot; (1999); two volumes of archaeology, &quot;The Modern Antiquarian&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Megalithic European&quot; (2004); and three volumes of musicology, &quot;Krautrocksampler&quot; (1995), &quot;Japrocksampler&quot; (2007); and &quot;Copendium: A Guide to the Musical Underground&quot; (2012).

==Early life==
Cope&#x27;s family resided in Tamworth, Staffordshire, but he was born in Deri, Glamorgan, Wales, where his mother&#x27;s parents lived, while she was staying there. Cope was staying with his grandmother near Aberfan on his ninth birthday, the day of the Aberfan disaster of 1966, which he has described as a key event of his childhood.

He grew up in Tamworth with his parents and his younger brother Joss. He played Oliver in Wilnecote High School&#x27;s production of the musical. Cope attended C.F. Mott College of Education (now Liverpool John Moores University), and it was here that he first became involved in music.

==Music==
===1976–77: Early bands===
In July 1977, Cope was one of the founders of Crucial Three, a Liverpool punk rock band in which he played bass guitar. Although the Crucial Three lasted for little more than six weeks and disbanded without ever playing in public, all three members eventually went on to lead successful Liverpool post-punk bands—singer Ian McCulloch with Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and guitarist Pete Wylie with the Mighty Wah!. Post-Crucial Three, Cope, and McCulloch initially went on to form other short-lived bands UH? and A Shallow Madness (Cope had also spent time with Wylie in another short-lived band, Nova Mob). When Cope sacked McCulloch from A Shallow Madness, McCulloch went on to form Echo and the Bunnymen. The two former bandmates would maintain a frequently antagonistic rivalry from then on, often carried out in public or in the press.

In late 1977, Cope joined the punk band The Mystery Girls with Pete Wylie, Pete Burns (later, of Dead or Alive) and Phil Hurst. They only had one performance (opening for Sham 69 at Eric&#x27;s Club in Liverpool in November 1977) before disbanding.

===1978–1983: The Teardrop Explodes===
In 1978, Cope formed the Teardrop Explodes with drummer Gary Dwyer, organist Paul Simpson and guitarist Mick Finkler, with himself as singer, bass player and principal songwriter. Drawing on a post-punk version of West Coast pop music (which gained the nickname of &quot;bubblegum trance&quot;), the band became part of a wave of neo-psychedelic Liverpool bands. Cope and Dwyer (and later their manager-turned-keyboard player David Balfe, who served both as Cope&#x27;s creative foil and his personal antagonist) were the only band constants, but seven other members passed in and out of the line-up during the band&#x27;s fractious four-year existence. Several well-received early singles (including &quot;Sleeping Gas&quot; and &quot;Treason&quot;) culminated in the band&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Reward&quot;, which hit number 6 in the UK singles chart and took the &quot;Kilimanjaro&quot; album to number 24 in the chart. Cope&#x27;s photogenic charm and wild, garrulous interview style helped keep the band in the media eye, and made him a short-lived teen idol during the band&#x27;s peak.

Success brought the Teardrops plenty of attention, but no further stability. Their second album &quot;Wilder&quot; experimented with different and darker psychedelic styles, as well as delving deeper into Cope&#x27;s complicated psyche: it spawned no major hits and sold relatively poorly at the time (despite being critically praised in retrospect). Excessive drug use plus continued infighting undermined the band, and a final lineup of Cope, Dwyer and Balfe split apart in 1982 after failed attempts to record a third album and a final disastrous tour.

Despite the relatively short life of the band, The Teardrop Explodes has continued to sustain interest and praise since its demise and the band&#x27;s back catalogue of recordings has been reissued several times over the last thirty years. Cope, however, has strenuously resisted taking advantage of any nostalgic and commercial opportunities to reunite the band.

===1982–85: The Mercury years – &quot;World Shut Your Mouth&quot; and &quot;Fried&quot;===
In 1982 (accompanied by his new American wife Dorian Beslity), Cope moved to the Staffordshire village of Drayton Bassett (close to his childhood home of Tamworth). Following the break up of the Teardrop Explodes, he spent a period in seclusion recovering from the strain of the group&#x27;s final year. Cope&#x27;s well-documented Teardrops-era LSD excesses, eccentric behaviour and subsequent retreat had led to him being labelled an &quot;acid casualty&quot; in the vein of Syd Barrett and Roky Erikson, an image which took him several years to shake off. During this period, Cope befriended a teenage Drayton Bassett musician called Donald Ross Skinner, who became his main musical foil for the next twelve years.
In 1983 Cope began recording the songs for his first solo album, &quot;World Shut Your Mouth&quot;. Although the album generally retained the uptempo pop drive of the Teardrops, it was also an introspective and surreal work with many references to childhood. Former Teardrops drummer Gary Dwyer, guitarist Steve Lovell and The Dream Academy oboist Kate St John all contributed to the album, which was released on Mercury Records in March 1984. &quot;World Shut Your Mouth&quot; was seen as out-of-step with the times, gained poor reviews and sold indifferently. A single from the album, &quot;Sunshine Playroom&quot;, featured a disturbing video directed by David Bailey. During a concert at Hammersmith Palais on the subsequent promotional tour, Cope slashed across his bare stomach with a broken microphone stand in an act of frustrated self-mutilation. Although the wounds were superficial, it shocked the audience and resulted in another memorable addition to his reputation for bizarre behaviour.

&quot;World Shut Your Mouth&quot; was followed six months later by 1984&#x27;s &quot;Fried&quot; album for which Cope was joined by Skinner, Lovell, St John, ex-Waterboys drummer Chris Whitten and Wah! guitarist Steve &quot;Brother Johnno&quot; Johnson. The album was much more raw in approach than its predecessor, and although in many respects it prefigured the looser and more mystical style which Cope would follow and be praised for in the next decade, it sold poorly at the time (as did the accompanying single &quot;Sunspots&quot;). Notoriously, the sleeve featured a naked Cope crouched on top of the Alvecote Mound slag heap clad only in a large turtle shell. The album includes a song called &quot;Bill Drummond Said&quot; about Cope&#x27;s A&amp;R man at WEA, to which future KLF star Drummond responded with a song titled &quot;Julian Cope Is Dead&quot;, pondering how much more famous Cope might have been had he been shot at the height of his fame. The commercial failure of &quot;Fried&quot; led to Polygram dropping Cope; he subsequently engaged a new manager Cally Callomon, and signed a deal with Island Records.

===1986–1992: The Island years===

====1986–1990: &quot;Saint Julian&quot; and &quot;My Nation Underground&quot;====

With Cally&#x27;s encouragement, Cope made the effort to clean up and compete. He formed a new backing group (informally known as the &quot;Two-Car Garage Band&quot;) featuring Skinner, Whitten, former Teardrops associate James Eller on bass guitar, and himself on vocals, rhythm guitar and assorted keyboards (Cope performed the latter under the alias of &quot;Double DeHarrison&quot; until the band hired Richard Frost as full-time keyboard player). This band lineup recorded Cope&#x27;s third solo album &quot;Saint Julian&quot;, mostly composed of crisp and memorable rock songs. It was trailed by the single &quot;World Shut Your Mouth&quot;, which became Cope&#x27;s biggest solo hit, reaching No. 19 in the UK in 1986 and becoming his only Top 20 solo hit. The parent album was well received and generated two more singles (&quot;Trampolene&quot; and &quot;Eve&#x27;s Volcano&quot;) but the fresh momentum did not last. Cope fell out with Callomon, and the Two-Car Garage band disintegrated as Eller joined The The and Whitten left for Paul McCartney&#x27;s band.

Back in London, and with only the faithful Skinner remaining, Cope enlisted his A&amp;R man Ron Fair as producer and recorded a follow-up album called &quot;My Nation Underground&quot;. This featured a varied lineup of musicians including Fair, Skinner, Danny Thompson, eccentric percussionist Rooster Cosby (who was to remain a close Cope associate) and assorted sessions musicians (some of whom, such as James Eller, had contributed to the previous album). &quot;My Nation Underground&quot; produced only one Top 40 single, &quot;Charlotte Anne&quot;, which also met with modest American success by reaching the top of the Modern Rock Tracks. Subsequent singles &quot;5 O&#x27;Clock World&quot; (a cover of a 1965 Vogues song) and the orchestral pop ballad &quot;China Doll&quot; both charted considerably lower, disappointing Island Records and further discouraging Cope, who had not enjoyed making the record and did not believe that it represented him properly as an artist.

To comfort himself, Cope spent a single illicit weekend at the end of the &quot;My Nation Underground&quot; sessions to create a second, lo-fi and unauthorised album called &quot;Skellington&quot;. Recorded in the same studio used for &quot;My Nation Underground&quot; on Island&#x27;s money (and predominantly featuring the same core team of Cope, Skinner, Cosby and Fair) it was seen by Cope as a far more genuine artistic statement recorded at a fraction of the money and time. Neither Island Records nor Cope&#x27;s current management team had any desire to release &quot;Skellington&quot; and Cope refused to record any other material while he feuded with them to try to get his new work released. Eventually, &quot;Skellington&quot; was released on the tiny Zippo label later in 1989, showing the poor relations between Cope and Island.

In 1990, Cope followed up &quot;Skellington&quot; with a second lo-fi album called &quot;Droolian&quot;, also recorded over three days. It was released only in Texas (on another small label, Mofoco) and the profits were used to aid of one of Cope&#x27;s heroes, the former 13th Floor Elevators frontman Roky Erickson, who at that time was in jail without legal representation.

====1991–92: &quot;Peggy Suicide&quot; and &quot;Jehovahkill&quot;====

During this period, Cope discovered the book &quot;Guitar Army: Rock and Revolution with The MC5 and the White Panther Party&quot; by John Sinclair. He later described it as his &quot;Holy Book&quot; and enthusiastically embraced its one-take approach to making and recording music (as well as its message of rock- and-roll being a weapon of cultural revolution). This method typified Cope&#x27;s musical approach from then on, as he forever left behind the more measured and constructed approach of &quot;Saint Julian&quot; and The Teardrop Explodes in favour of more spontaneous expression.

Having repaired his relationship with Island Records, Cope began recording his next record against the background of the civil demonstrations which became the Poll Tax Riots. Cope joined the demonstrations and took a prominent role in them. Wearing a huge theatrical costume throughout the march, he was later featured on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Poll Tax&quot; documentary, a lone protester walking down Whitehall surrounded by seven lines of mounted police.

These (and other) elements fed into the double album &quot;Peggy Suicide&quot;, which was released on Island Records in 1991 and was heralded by critics as Cope&#x27;s best work to date. On the album&#x27;s songs, Cope laid bare many of his personal convictions including his hatred of organized religion and his increasing public interest in women&#x27;s rights, the occult, alternative spirituality (including paganism and Goddess worship), animal rights, and ecology. Skinner, Rooster Cosby, Ron Fair and former Smiths drummer Mike Joyce all contributed to the record, as did a new sidekick in the shape of future Spiritualized lead guitarist Michael Watts (better known as Mike Mooney or &quot;Moon-eye&quot;). Although the album produced another well-received single (&quot;Beautiful Love&quot;) the political content of &quot;Peggy Suicide&quot; caused more friction with Island, who had signed Cope as a marketable hit-making alternative rocker but increasingly found themselves dealing with a latter-day counter-culturalist and revolutionary. Cope toured the album, including several dates in Japan which were recorded (although the results were not released until 2004, on the live album &quot;Live Japan &#x27;91&quot;.)

In 1992, Cope released another double album. &quot;Jehovahkill&quot;, on Island Records. Musically, the album reflected his interest in Krautrock (though in a more electro-acoustic based form) and his teenage fascination for Detroit hard rock. (A deluxe edition, with a disc of extra material, was released fourteen years later in 2006). Lyrically, the album was fiercely anti-Christian, with such songs as &quot;Poet is Priest&quot;, &quot;Julian H. Cope&quot;, and the single &quot;Fear Loves This Place&quot; espousing Cope&#x27;s Paganesque perspective and being highly critical of the established Church. The content (and lack of sales) proved to be too much for Island Records. Despite the album reaching the UK Top 20, the label dropped Cope in the same week that his three shows sold out at London&#x27;s 1,800 capacity Town &amp; Country Club. The music press mounted an outcry at Island&#x27;s decision, with the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (NME) featuring him on their front cover under the headline &quot;Endangered Species&quot; while &quot;Select&quot; magazine started a campaign to have Cope re-signed. Engaged in a tour of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, Cope refused to comment.

===1993–96: &quot;Rite&quot; to &quot;20 Mothers&quot; and &quot;Interpreter&quot;===

From this point onwards, Cope began to take greater personal control of his career and business affairs. While he continued to sign contracts with established record labels, he would begin to release more esoteric projects independently. The first of these projects (issued on Cope&#x27;s own K.A.K. label) was a collaboration with Donald Ross Skinner: an album of instrumental jams called &quot;Rite&quot;, inspired by Krautrock, Sly Stone-styled psychedelic funk and spiritual mysticism. Cope also took the opportunity to issue &quot;The Skellington Chronicles&quot; (an expanded version of &quot;Skellington&quot; along with a follow-up album in the same vein called &quot;Skellington 2: He&#x27;s Back ... and this time it&#x27;s personal&quot;) and would record a number of tracks released eighteen years later as 2011&#x27;s &quot;The Jehovahcoat Demos&quot;. During this period, Cope began his work as a writer, completing the first volume of his autobiography and beginning to research works on Krautrock and Neolithic architecture.
Signing to the Def Jam subsidiary American Recordings for a one-off album deal, Cope recorded &quot;Autogeddon&quot;, which was released in 1994. Continuing to build on the musical approach of &quot;Peggy Suicide&quot; and &quot;Jehovahkill&quot; but with a greater element of space rock, the album used the automobile as its central metaphor for individual and collective struggles between responsibility and selfishness, along with further stabs at patriarchy. &quot;Autogeddon&quot; was the first Cope album to feature synthesizer player Thighpaulsandra, who would become another key Cope collaborator. In the same year, Cope and Thighpaulsandra would form the ambient-electronic project Queen Elizabeth: the eponymous &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; album was released on the Echo Label, Cope&#x27;s mainstream home for the next two years.
Cope&#x27;s next album under his own name was 1995&#x27;s &quot;20 Mothers&quot; which revisited many of his existing lyrical preoccupations but with a more sprawling and eclectic musical approach (including stronger elements of pop and folk) and more directly personal and reflective material dealing with Cope&#x27;s own family. The album received very positive reviews and also spawned the Top 40 single &quot;Try, Try, Try&quot;, which led to two Top of the Pops performances. The subsequent British live tour (featuring Cosby, Mooney, Thighpaulsandra, and keyboard-player-turned-bass-guitarist Richard Frost) was fraught with tension, and Mooney subsequently moved on to Spiritualized. Cope had also parted company with his long-term foil Donald Ross Skinner during the recording of &quot;20 Mothers&quot;, although the parting was relatively amicable.

Having been dropped by Echo when he refused to visit the US, Cope then signed to Cooking Vinyl and delivered the &quot;Interpreter&quot; album in 1996. This continued in a similar but more disciplined vein to its predecessor, with stronger elements of techno and humour (as exemplified in songs like &quot;Cheap New Age Fix&quot;) among the more serious topics, such as those inspired by Cope&#x27;s attendance at the Newbury Bypass protests.

===1997–present: Head Heritage===
====1997–2006: Assorted solo and collaborative work; Brain Donor====

Cope&#x27;s battle with music industry operatives (whom he referred to as &quot;greedheads&quot;) saw him finally turn his back on the mainstream music industry from this point onwards. From 1997, Cope opted for full career independence, launching his Head Heritage organisation as combined record label, website and discussion forum.
The first Head Heritage release was 1997&#x27;s &quot;Rite 2&quot;, Cope&#x27;s follow up to 1993&#x27;s &quot;Rite&quot; (with Thighpaulsandra taking over from Donald Ross Skinner as creative foil). It was followed in the same year by the second Queen Elizabeth album, &quot;QE2: Elizabeth Vagina&quot;, which expanded on its predecessor&#x27;s cosmic rock experiments. Thighpaulsandra would then follow Michael Mooney into Spiritualized (as would Cope&#x27;s string arranger Martin Shellard), once more depriving Cope of a key collaborator. Cope&#x27;s next full solo album was 1999&#x27;s &quot;Odin&quot;, which consisted of a single 73-minute mantra for voices and electronics (although Thighpaulsandra has claimed credit for some of the work).

In 1999, Cope launched another side project. This was the garage-rock/heavy metal power trio Brain Donor, which featured Cope on bass, Anthony &quot;Doggen&quot; Foster on guitar and Spiritualized&#x27;s Kevin &quot;Kevlar&quot; Bales on drums. The band was as much theatrical as musical, featuring full face makeup, platform boots and ostentatious double-neck guitars. Cope stated that the band&#x27;s aim was to fuse the swaggering arena rock of KISS and Van Halen with elements of Japanese heavy metal, Detroit garage rock and Blue Cheer. He also described Brain Donor as &quot;pure white lightning played by forward-thinking motherfuckers&quot; while also asserting that he loathed the &quot;microcephalous ass (of) real heavy metal&quot;, seeing Brain Donor as part of his ongoing shamanic efforts.

In 2000, Cope released another solo album – &quot;An Audience with the Cope&quot;. While appearing to be pitched as a retrospective live recording, it consisted of a series of newly written psychedelic studio jams.

Since 1998, Cope had developed a parallel reputation as a serious antiquarian. This resulted in his 2001 album &quot;Discover Odin&quot; being a limited-edition tie-in with a talk he had given at the British Museum, featuring a mixture of spoken-word tracks exploring Nordic mythology and various musical tracks including a Cope setting of the epic Norse poem &quot;Hávamál&quot;. In the same year Head Heritage released the first two Brain Donor singles, &quot;She Saw Me Coming&quot; and &quot;Get Off Your Pretty Face&quot;, followed by the début Brain Donor album &quot;Love Peace &amp; Fuck&quot;. Cope, Doggen and a returning Thighpaulsandra also teamed up as the drummer-less psychedelic/meditational heavy metal group L.A.M.F. who released the &quot;Ambient Metal&quot; album the same year. Brain Donor&#x27;s &quot;Get Back on It&quot; single followed in 2002, as did the third album in Cope&#x27;s &quot;Rite&quot; series, &quot;Rite Now&quot;.
In 2003, Cope performed at the Glastonbury Festival as well as launching his own three-day &quot;Rome Wasn&#x27;t Burned in a Day&quot; event. A tie-in album, also called &quot;Rome Wasn&#x27;t Burned in a Day&quot;, was released to mark the event and included an &quot;eight-minute long Armenian epic&quot; called &quot;Shrine of the Black Youth (Tukh Manukh)&quot;. The album was recorded by a trio of Cope, synth player Christopher Patrick &quot;Holy&quot; McGrail and Donald Ross Skinner (returning to work with Cope after seven years). The year also saw more Brain Donor activity via the &quot;My Pagan Ass&quot; single and the album &quot;Too Freud To Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll, Too Jung To Die&quot; and an appearance on Sunn O)))&#x27;s collaborative album &quot;White1&quot; with Cope reciting occultic druid poetry on the opening track, &quot;My Wall&quot;.

Cope released two more albums in 2005. The first of these was the long-delayed &quot;Citizen Cain&#x27;d&quot;, an album which Cope had promised for several years and now delivered as a short double album (71 minutes over two discs) sold at a single album price. (According to Cope, the two-disc format was due to some of the songs being &quot;too psychologically exhausting&quot; to fit together onto a single album). The second album, &quot;Dark Orgasm&quot; was a forthright hard-rock exercise which Cope described as &quot;a violent sequence of outcast broadsides leveled at the coming new 21st-century conservatism.&quot; Meanwhile, Brain Donor (proving to be an enduring Cope project) was presented to America via a self-titled compilation album. Plans to tour the United States were dropped because the INS refused to grant Cope a visa.

2006 saw the release of the third proper Brain Donor album (&quot;Drain&#x27;d Boner&quot;) and the fourth album in the &quot;Rite&quot; series (&quot;Rite Bastard&quot;).

====2007–present: &quot;Black Sheep&quot; and beyond====

Cope&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;You Gotta Problem With Me&quot;, was something of a return to his early solo material: more post-punk styled, and featuring swathes of Mellotron and orchestral percussion. Conceptually, it continued his attacks on religion, bigotry, corporate greed and environmental destruction. As with &quot;Citizen Cain&#x27;d&quot;, Cope divided the fifty-six minutes of material across two CDs and also included lavish packaging including printed poems.

&quot;You Gotta Problem With Me&quot; was followed by 2008&#x27;s &quot;Black Sheep&quot;, which Cope described as &quot;a musical exploration of what it is to be an outsider in modern Western Culture&quot; and which featured his most outrightly anarchic pronouncements to date. Dominated by Mellotron, hand drums and acoustic guitars, the album also featured Doggen and McGrail plus new recruits Michael O&#x27;Sullivan and Ady &quot;Acoustika&quot; Fletcher. In November 2008, Cope released the &quot;Preaching Revolution EP&quot;, mingling acoustic protest songs with rockabilly pieces: along with material from the unreleased &quot;Diggers, Ranters, Levellers EP&quot;, these songs would be reissued on Cope&#x27;s limited-edition Cope solo album, &quot;The Unruly Imagination&quot;.

Cope, McGrail, O&#x27;Sullivan, and Acoustika went on to form a new ten-piece Cope side project (also called Black Sheep) which included new cohorts such as drummer Antony &quot;Antronhy&quot; Hodgkinson, &quot;Fat Paul&quot; Horlick and former Universal Panzies leader Christophe F. To date, Black Sheep has generated two further albums, both released in 2009 – &quot;Kiss My Sweet Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;Black Sheep at the BBC&quot;. 2009 also saw the release of a fourth Brain Donor album (&quot;Wasted Fuzz Excessive&quot;) and a live Queen Elizabeth album &quot; Hall&quot;, recorded in 2000.

==Writing==

===Music commentary===

Cope has long been an avid champion of obscure and underground music. While still a member of the Teardrop Explodes, he was instrumental in the critical rehabilitation of the reclusive singer Scott Walker, compiling &quot;Fire Escape in the Sky: The Godlike Genius of Scott Walker&quot; for release by Bill Drummond&#x27;s Zoo Records. This sparked renewed interest in the work of Walker (although years later Cope commented that the singer&#x27;s &quot;Pale White Intellectual&quot; outlook on life no longer held any fascination for him).

Cope established himself as a musicologist with his books &quot;Krautrocksampler&quot;, &quot;Japrocksampler&quot; and &quot;Copendium&quot;. Released in 1996, &quot;Krautrocksampler&quot; covers the German bands of the 1970s dubbed &quot;krautrock&quot; by the British music press. Reviews at the time were ecstatic, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; citing it as &quot;a work of real passion and scholarship&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; agreed: &quot;This is a superb book ... this is an extraordinary book.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; went further, writing: &quot;Brilliantly researched, Krautrocksampler abounds with revelations, and Cope&#x27;s enthusiasm verges on the lethal ... a sort of lysergic Lester Bangs.&quot; In the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, the reviewer wrote: &quot;German 1970s minimalism is invading the British rock scene ... an Englishman is to blame ... Krautrocksampler is a lively history of a fascinating period, half encyclopedia, half psychedelic detective story.&quot;

Cope&#x27;s writing has also won respect in academic circles. His second work as a musicologist, &quot;Japrocksampler&quot; – subtitled &quot;How the post war Japanese blew their minds on rock and roll&quot; – was published by HarperCollins in October 2007.
His Album of the Month reviews on the Unsung section of his website (collected and published in 2012 as &quot;Copendium&quot;) have promoted bands such as Comets on Fire, Sunn O))) (with whom he performed a guest vocal on their White1 album) and several Japanese bands which feature in &quot;Japrocksampler&quot;. Unsung is another community-based site that invites contributors&#x27; reviews, and Cope and the site&#x27;s numerous contributors have been instrumental in kick-starting the interest in bands like Sir Lord Baltimore, Blue Cheer, Les Rallizes Denudes, Tractor and the Groundhogs. Cope is also considered to be one of the first bloggers; he has been airing his sometimes controversial views since 1997 via his website&#x27;s &quot;Address Drudion&quot; on the first day of each month.

===Archaeology and antiquarianism===

1998 saw the release of Cope&#x27;s bestseller &quot;The Modern Antiquarian&quot;, a large and comprehensive full-colour 448-page work detailing stone circles and other ancient monuments of prehistoric Britain, which sold out of its first edition of 20,000 in its first month of publication and was accompanied by a BBC Two documentary. &quot;The Times&quot; called the book: &quot;A ripping good read ... it is deeply impressive ... ancient history: the new rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot; said: &quot;A unique blend of information, observation, personal experience and opinion which is as unlike the normal run of archaeology books as you can imagine.&quot; The historian Ronald Hutton went further, calling the book: &quot;the best popular guide to Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments for half a century.&quot;

&quot;The Modern Antiquarian&quot; was followed in 2004 with an even larger 484-page study of similar monuments across Europe entitled &quot;The Megalithic European&quot;, the most extensive study of European megalithic sites to date. In addition to his books on prehistoric monuments, Cope hosts a community-based Modern Antiquarian website that invites contributors to add their own knowledge of the ancient sites of Britain and Ireland. Cope has lectured nationally on the subject of prehistory, and also at the British Museum on the subjects of Avebury and Odin, where Cope appeared in five-inch platform boots and his hairspray set off fire alarms, causing the building to be evacuated.

===Fiction===
On 19 June 2014 Cope&#x27;s first novel &quot;One Three One&quot;, subtitled &quot;A Time-Shifting Gnostic Hooligan Road Novel&quot;, was published by Faber &amp; Faber. Named for a Sardinian motorway, &quot;One Three One&quot; was well reviewed by &quot;The Guardian&quot; who wrote that &quot;the musician&#x27;s fiction debut is brilliant, serious, funny – and completely bonkers&quot;. Comedian Stewart Lee interviewed Cope for &quot;The Quietus&quot; and admits that &quot;there were whole swathes of &quot;One Three One&quot; where I couldn&#x27;t tell what was going on (or) which time stream we were in...but I didn&#x27;t care&quot;.

Cope writes about many fictional bands and musicians in the book and has recorded music in the guise of these characters, some of which he has released under the same fictional pseudonyms. Other musical artists have collaborated with Cope for these releases, also under the book&#x27;s fictional names, including Stephen O&#x27;Malley and Holy McGrail (as drone group Vesuvio) and with Robert Courtney and Donald Ross Skinner (as ravers Dayglo Maradona), amongst others. These releases were released via various imprints of Cope&#x27;s Head Heritage label.

<text>Salomon Mikhailovich Flohr (November 21, 1908 – July 18, 1983) was a Czechoslovak and Soviet chess player and writer. He was among the first recipients of the title International Grandmaster from FIDE in 1950. Flohr dominated many tournaments of the pre-World War II years, and by the late 1930s was considered a contender for the World Championship. However, his patient, positional style was overtaken by the sharper, more tactical methods of the younger Soviet echelon after World War II.

== Early life ==
Flohr had a troubled childhood beset by personal crises. He was born in a Jewish family in Horodenka in what was then Galicia, Austria-Hungary (now in Ukraine). He and his brother were orphaned during World War I when their parents were killed in a massacre, and they fled to the newly formed nation of Czechoslovakia.

Flohr settled in Prague, gradually acquiring a reputation as a skilled chess player by playing for stakes in the city&#x27;s many cafés. During 1924, he participated in simultaneous exhibitions by Richard Réti and Rudolf Spielmann, and he was still giving displays well into his seventies.

==Early successes==
Flohr won the Kautsky Memorial tournaments of 1928 and 1929 which were held in Prague, and made his international debut at the Rohitsch-Sauerbrunn (Rogaška Slatina) tournament in Slovenia, where he finished second to Akiba Rubinstein in the latter&#x27;s final success. Flohr had also taken a job as a chess journalist; one of his first assignments was to cover the 1928 Berlin tournament, during which he continued to win money on the side by playing chess.

==World title contender==

Flohr&#x27;s playing ability peaked in the mid-1930s, when he became one of the world&#x27;s strongest players and a leading contender for the World Championship. He became champion of Czechoslovakia in 1933 and 1936 and played in many tournaments throughout Europe, generally finishing amongst the top three. Notable victories were at Bad Sliač in 1932, where he shared first place with Milan Vidmar; Scheveningen in 1933; Bad Liebenwerda in 1934 with 9½/11; Barcelona in 1935 where he tied for first with George Koltanowski; Moscow 1935 where he tied for first place with future World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik; Poděbrady in 1936 with the score of +10 −1 =6; and Kemeri in 1937 where he shared the top spot with Vladimir Petrov and Samuel Reshevsky. During this period, he had several other notable high finishes, such as Bern 1932 (tied for second with 11½/15, after World Champion Alexander Alekhine); Zürich 1934 (tied for second with 12/15, again trailing Alekhine); and Pärnu 1937 (second behind Paul Felix Schmidt).

Flohr also frequently visited England, regularly playing in the Hastings tournaments of the 1930s. He finished first in 1931/32, 1932/33 and 1933/34, he finished in a tie for first place with Max Euwe and Sir George Thomas in 1934/35, and he was second behind Reuben Fine in 1935/36. He also won the Margate tournament of 1936 ahead of former World Champion José Raúl Capablanca.

Flohr became a national hero in Czechoslovakia during the 1930s. His name was used to sell many of the luxury products of the time, including Salo Flohr cigarettes, slippers and eau-de-cologne.

==Excels in Chess Olympiads==
His form for his adopted country in the Chess Olympiads was equally impressive, according to the comprehensive Olympiad site olimpbase.org. He made his debut at Hamburg 1930 on board one, scoring 14½/17 for the silver medal. On home soil at Prague 1931, again on board one, he scored 11/18, and led Czechoslovakia to a team bronze medal. At Folkestone 1933, he again played board one, scored 9/14, helped Czechoslovakia win the team silver medal, and earned a bronze medal for himself. At Warsaw 1935, on board one he scored an undefeated 13/17 for another individual gold medal, and Czechoslovakia finished fifth. Then at Stockholm 1937, once again on board one, he scored 12½/16 for a third individual gold medal. In five Olympiads, he won two individual gold medals, a silver and a bronze. His aggregate was 60/82, for a 73% score against the top players in the world.

==Match results==
Flohr enjoyed a fair amount of success in match play. He played matches with two of his main rivals for the right to challenge reigning champion Alexander Alekhine. He tied a 16-game match against Euwe in 1932 (+3 −3 =10), and he tied a match against Botvinnik in 1933 (+2 −2 =8). Flohr beat Gösta Stoltz by 5½–2½ in 1931, and a year later he beat Mir Sultan Khan, the 1932 and 1933 British Champion, by 3½–2½. Flohr also defeated Johannes van den Bosch at The Hague in 1932 by 6–2. In 1933, he won two matches in Switzerland, first over Oskar Naegeli by 4–2 at Bern, and then by 4½–1½ over Henri Grob at Arosa.

== Official challenger, war years ==

Flohr had married in 1935. By 1937, FIDE had nominated him as the official candidate to play Alekhine for the World Championship. However, with World War II looming, it proved impossible for Flohr to raise the stake money in Czechoslovakia, so the plans were dropped. The next year, Flohr was one of the eight elite players invited to the great AVRO tournament of November 1938. He finished last, and this put an end to his chances of a World Championship match with Alekhine. AVRO may have been the only time in chess history when the top eight players in the world contested an important tournament.

While AVRO was a strong tournament and Flohr&#x27;s last-placed finish was no disgrace, his result may also be explained by his difficult personal circumstances at the time. The German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938 had left Flohr, as a Polish-Ukrainian Jew, in grave personal danger. Flohr remained in the Netherlands in early 1939, playing in several small events. He tied for first place in Amsterdam KNSB with Max Euwe and László Szabó at 3½/5. He tied third/fourth place in Amsterdam VARA with 3/5, as Euwe and Salo Landau won. He won Baarn I with 2½/3. Then, he and his family fled, first to Sweden, and then to Moscow with the help of his friend Botvinnik. While in Sweden, he tied for first place at Gothenburg with Rudolf Spielmann with 10 points out of 11.

== Soviet citizen, recovers form ==

Flohr was able to recover his form after reaching safety in Moscow. He won Kemeri 1939 with a score of 12/15. He also won the strong 1939 Leningrad/Moscow tournament with 12/17. He tied for second place at Margate 1939 with 6½/9 behind Paul Keres. He then tied for second at Bournemouth 1939 with 8½/11, behind former World Champion Euwe.

Flohr did not play in any official strong Soviet events from 1940–42, though he did lose a 1942 match to Vladimir Makogonov in Baku by 2–0. He became a naturalized Soviet citizen in 1942, and developed his writing career in his new country, contributing articles to Soviet newspapers and magazines including &quot;Ogonek&quot;. As the Soviet Union first stopped then reversed the Axis invasion, some chess activity started up again, and in 1943 Flohr won a small but strong tournament in Baku. In 1944 he was again victorious in a Bolshevik Society tournament at Kyiv, tied with Alexei Sokolsky. He withdrew from the 1945 USSR Championship after only three games.

After the war, he was still a contender for a possible World Championship match. He finished 6th at the 1948 Interzonal in Saltsjöbaden, thereby qualifying for the 1950 Candidates Tournament in Budapest. However, he finished joint last with 7 out of 18, and never entered the World Championship cycle again, concentrating on journalism. He also developed a role as a chess organiser. He did play periodically at high levels, both within the Soviet Union and abroad, with some success, until the late 1960s. He was awarded the title of International Arbiter in 1963.

Flohr died in Moscow on July 18, 1983.

== Achievements and legacy ==

Flohr was one of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s greatest chess players ever and proved virtually invincible at the Olympiads of the 1930s. His tournament record was impressive, with his tactical skill and excellent endgame technique securing him many famous victories. FIDE awarded him the International Grandmaster title on its inaugural list in 1950. He made some important contributions to opening theory: a &#x27;Flohr variation&#x27; can be found in six major openings, including the Caro–Kann Defence, the Ruy Lopez, the English Opening, and the Grünfeld Defence. The Flohr–Zaitsev Variation of the Closed Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 Bb7 10.d4 Re8) was successfully adopted by World Champion Anatoly Karpov in the 1980s.

Flohr was primarily a strategist who excelled in the endgame. He favoured the closed game with White, and during the prime of his career, he was especially deadly with the Queen&#x27;s Gambit, as the game selection shows. Flohr almost never opened with 1.e4. He was one of the main developers of the Caro–Kann, which was an obscure and poorly regarded line as late as the 1920s when Flohr adopted it.

The Second World War killed any chance he had of winning the world title, and the stress of becoming a refugee for the second time in his life affected his style of play. He became a much more cautious player in his post-war games and earned a drawish reputation, with many short draws which were hardly contested. Players such as Vasily Smyslov, David Bronstein, Isaac Boleslavsky, Paul Keres, Alexander Kotov, Tigran Petrosian, Efim Geller, Mark Taimanov, Yuri Averbakh, Boris Spassky, Mikhail Tal, Viktor Korchnoi, and Leonid Stein dominated the landscape with their sharper styles and innovative openings.

Flohr was never able to defeat Alekhine head-to-head, losing five games and drawing seven in their 12 encounters. Alekhine had a sharp, tactical style, and he could also play outstanding positional chess.

According to the site Chessmetrics.com, which compares historical ratings, Flohr was among the world&#x27;s top 20 players from 1930 to 1951, except for the war years 1942–44 when he was largely inactive; and his ranking peaked at No. 2 in the world in 1935.

<doc id="617752" wikidata="Q295201" url="?curid=617752" title="Stephen Hendry">
<text>Stephen Gordon Hendry (born 13 January 1969) is a Scottish retired professional snooker player and a current commentator and pundit. One of the most successful players in snooker history, he turned professional in 1985, aged 16, and rose rapidly through the snooker world rankings, reaching number four in the world by the end of his third professional season. He won his first World Snooker Championship in 1990, aged 21 years and 106 days, making him the sport&#x27;s youngest world champion, a record he still holds. He won seven world titles between 1990 and 1999, setting a new modern-era record that stood outright until Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan equalled it in 2022. He also won the Masters six times and the UK Championship five times for a career total of 18 Triple Crown tournament wins, a total exceeded only by O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s 23. His total of 36 ranking titles is second only to O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s 41, while his nine seasons as world number one were the most by any player under the annual ranking system used until 2010.

Hendry&#x27;s five consecutive Masters titles between 1989 and 1993 and five consecutive world titles between 1992 and 1996 remain records in the modern era. His 36 consecutive victories in ranking events between March 1990 and January 1991 and his 29 consecutive wins at the Crucible between 1992 and 1997 also remain modern-era records. One of three players to have won all three Triple Crown events in a single season, he is the only player to have achieved the feat twice, in the 1989–90 and 1995–96 seasons. His 777 career century breaks include 11 maximum breaks, putting him in third place behind O&#x27;Sullivan (15) and John Higgins (13) for the most officially recognised maximums in professional competition. Awarded an MBE in 1994, he was twice named the BBC Scotland Sports Personality of the Year, in 1987 and 1996.

Hendry&#x27;s form became less consistent after his sixth world title in 1996 and his career declined in the 2000s, his play increasingly affected by the yips. He reached the last of his nine world finals at the 2002 World Championship but lost in a deciding frame to Peter Ebdon. He won his last ranking title at the 2005 Malta Cup and reached his last ranking final at the 2006 UK Championship, where he was again defeated by Ebdon. During the 2011–12 season, he fell out of the top 16 in the world rankings for the first time in 23 years. He qualified for the 2012 World Championship, where he made his 27th consecutive Crucible appearance, but he announced his retirement from professional snooker at age 43 following a 2–13 defeat to Stephen Maguire in the quarter-finals. After almost nine years in retirement, he returned to professional competition during the 2020–21 season under an invitational tour card. He played sporadically on the professional tour over four seasons but secured only three wins in 20 professional matches and retired again after the 2023–24 season. Hendry has also competed on the World Seniors Tour and has twice been a semi-finalist at the World Seniors Championship.

== Early life ==
Hendry&#x27;s parents, Gordon Hendry and Irene Rixson, met as teenagers in the late 1960s while working at a woollen merchant in Edinburgh. Irene, who worked as a secretary, became pregnant, and she and Gordon moved into a bedroom of his grandmother&#x27;s flat in St Leonard&#x27;s, Edinburgh. Irene was 18 years old when she gave birth to Hendry on 13 January 1969. The family subsequently moved to Gorgie. Hendry&#x27;s younger brother Keith was born in 1972, and the family moved to Baberton Mains. His father was then working in the fruit and vegetable wholesale business. 

By the late 1970s, Hendry&#x27;s father and a business partner were running three greengrocer&#x27;s shops, located in Inverkeithing, Dalgety Bay, and Dunfermline. The family moved to a bungalow in Dalgety Bay when Hendry was nine and lived there for the next six years. He attended Inverkeithing High School. He started playing snooker when his parents bought him a miniature snooker table for Christmas in 1981. He subsequently began playing on full-sized tables at Maloco&#x27;s Snooker Hall and the Classic Snooker Centre in Dunfermline. He made his first century break, a 102, at the Classic Snooker Centre several months after his 13th birthday in 1982. 

When Hendry was 15, his parents separated. Due to financial difficulties caused by his father&#x27;s problem gambling, they had to sell their house and business interests. Hendry&#x27;s mother moved with her two sons to a council house in her hometown of Kirkliston, and Hendry began attending Queensferry High School. His father moved to a small flat in nearby Broxburn but travelled frequently with Hendry to snooker tournaments around the country. Hendry lived in a flat in South Queensferry during the early part of his professional snooker career.

==Career==
===Amateur years (1982–1985)===
Hendry&#x27;s first tournament win was an under-16 &quot;Stars of the Future&quot; event at a Pontins holiday camp in Prestatyn, Wales. After winning both the Scottish and British Under-16 Championships, he made his first televised appearance in 1983 on &quot;Junior Pot Black&quot;, where he defeated Nick Pearce but then lost to Steve Ventham in the semi-finals. In 1984, he became the youngest ever winner of the Scottish Amateur Championship. At the 1984 World Amateur Snooker Championship he became the youngest player ever to participate in the championship. He finished sixth-placed in his qualifying group of nine participants, and did not qualify for the final stages, 

In February 1985, his application for professional status was accepted by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. Two months later, he retained the Scottish Amateur Championship. Aged 16 years, he was then the sport&#x27;s youngest professional. From the age of 14 he was managed by Ron Clover, who also managed darts player Jocky Wilson, but when he was 16 Ian Doyle and Jim Marley took over his management after paying Clover £2,000. Doyle, who was influenced by Barry Hearn&#x27;s style of management, arranged a series of money matches against leading players for Hendry, mirroring the way that Hearn had arranged matches for Steve Davis before he turned professional.

===Early professional years (1985–1989)===
In his debut season as a professional, Hendry earnt his first ranking point at the 1986 Classic, eliminating Dessie Sheehan, Graham Miles and Silvino Francisco before losing 4-5 to Neal Foulds. He won the Scottish Professional Championship, becoming the youngest player to win any national professional title. He won four qualifying matches to reach the main stage of the 1986 World Snooker Championship, losing 8–10 to Willie Thorne in the first round. Aged 17 years and 3 months, he was then the youngest player to compete at the final stages of a world championship, a record he held for 26 years until Luca Brecel made his Crucible debut in 2012 aged two months younger.

In the 1986–87 season, Hendry and Mike Hallett reached the final of the 1986 World Doubles Championship, which they lost 3-10 to Steve Davis and Tony Meo, Hendry reached his first ranking semi-final at the Classic but lost 3–9 to Steve Davis. He then retained his Scottish Professional Championship title. Having won three qualifying matches to reach the main stage of the 1987 World Championship, he then eliminated Thorne and Steve Longworth to progress to
the quarter-finals. He lost 12–13 to defending champion Joe Johnson, despite coming from 1–8 and 8–12 behind to force a deciding frame.

Hendry defeated Hallett to win the invitational 1987 Australian Masters, and was runner-up to Steve Davis at the 1987 Hong Kong Masters. During the 1987–88 season, Hendry won his first ranking title, beating Taylor 10–7 in the final of the Grand Prix. He and Hallett won the 1987 World Doubles Championship, defeating Dennis Taylor and Cliff Thorburn 12–6 in the final. Hendry captured his second ranking title at the British Open with a 13–2 victory against Hallett in the final. He also won his third consecutive Scottish Professional Championship. By the end of his third professional season, he had reached number four in the world rankings and was named the BBC Scotland Sports Personality of the Year for 1987. Although he failed to win a ranking title during the 1988–89 season, he won the Masters on his debut, defeating John Parrott 9–6 in the final. He reached his first world semi-final at the 1989 World Championship but lost 9–16 to the eventual champion Davis.

===World Champion and World Number One (1989–1999)===
The 1989–90 season saw Hendry win four ranking titles and two notable invitational events. He won his first UK Championship, defeating Davis 16–12 in the final; won his second Masters, defeating Parrott 9–4 in the final; and won his first world title at the 1990 World Championship, beating Jimmy White 18–12 in the final. He became the second player to win all three Triple Crown events in the same season, after Davis had first achieved the feat two seasons earlier. Aged 21 years and 106 days, he superseded Alex Higgins as the sport&#x27;s youngest world champion, a record he still held as of 2020. He also won ranking titles at the Dubai Classic and Asian Open and became world number one for the first time at the end of the season.

In the 1990–91 season, Hendry became the first player to win five ranking titles in a single season. He won his second UK Championship, defeating Davis 16–15 in the final, and his third Masters, defeating Hallett 9–8 in the final after trailing 0–7 and 2–8. However, he failed to retain his world title at the 1991 World Championship; he lost 11–13 to Steve James in the quarter-finals, despite having led 11–9, falling victim to the Crucible curse. In the 1991–92 season, he won his fourth Masters, defeating Parrott 9–4 in the final. He won his second world title at the 1992 World Championship, where he came from 8–14 behind against White in the final to win ten consecutive frames for an 18–14 victory. He achieved his first maximum break in professional competition while playing Thorne in the Matchroom League.

In the 1992–93 season, Hendry won his fifth consecutive Masters, beating James Wattana 9–5 in the final. He won his third world title at the 1993 World Championship, defeating White 18–5 in the final with a &lt;dfn&gt;session to spare&lt;/dfn&gt;, having lost just 25 frames in the tournament. In the 1993–94 season, he reached the final of the UK Championship but lost 6–10 to 17-year-old Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, who won his maiden ranking title at the event. Hendry reached a sixth consecutive Masters final but lost 8–9 to his compatriot Alan McManus, his first defeat at the Masters. He won his fourth world title at the 1994 World Championship, clinching an 18–17 victory in the deciding frame of the final after White missed a black off the spot. It was the last time White featured in a World Championship final, having lost all six finals he contested, four of them to Hendry.

In 1994, Hendry was awarded an MBE. In the 1994–95 season, he won his third UK Championship, defeating Ken Doherty 10–5 in the final and setting a new record for the most centuries in a professional match, with seven. This still holds the record for the most centuries in a 19-frame match as well as jointly holding the record (with Judd Trump and Ding Junhui) for the most centuries in any professional contest. Hendry ended the season by winning the 1995 World Championship, defeating O&#x27;Sullivan 13–8 in the quarter-finals, White 16–12 in the semi-finals, and Nigel Bond 18–9 in the final to claim his fifth world title.

In the 1995–96 season, Hendry again won all three Triple Crown events: He defeated Peter Ebdon 10–3 to win his fourth UK Championship, defeated O&#x27;Sullivan 10–5 to win his sixth Masters, and defeated Ebdon 18–12 in the 1996 World Championship final to win his sixth world title, equalling the modern-era record held by Ray Reardon and Steve Davis. Hendry remains the only player to win all three Triple Crown events in two different seasons. He was named the BBC Scotland Sports Personality of the Year for a second time in 1996. In the 1996–97 season, Hendry won his fifth UK Championship, coming from 4–8 behind to defeat John Higgins 10–9 in the final. In the best-of-17 Liverpool Victoria Charity Challenge final, he led O&#x27;Sullivan 8–2 but O&#x27;Sullivan won six consecutive frames to take the match to a deciding frame. However, Hendry won the decider with a maximum break for a 9–8 victory, making him the only player to make a maximum break in the deciding frame of a final. At the 1997 World Championship, Hendry reached a sixth consecutive world final but lost 12–18 to Doherty, his first defeat in a world final and his first loss at the Crucible since 1991. His 29 consecutive victories at the Crucible over that period remains a record.

Hendry won only one ranking title in the 1997–98 season, despite reaching two of the three Triple Crown finals. He lost the UK Championship final 6–10 to O&#x27;Sullivan. In the 1998 Masters final, he led Williams 9–6, needing just one frame for victory. However, Williams took the match to a deciding frame and went on to win on a re-spotted black. At the 1998 World Championship, Hendry lost 4–10 to White in the first round. After eight consecutive seasons as world number one, he fell to second place in the rankings behind the new world champion John Higgins. In the 1998–99 season, he suffered a shock 0–9 whitewash to world number 73 Marcus Campbell in the first round of the UK Championship. It was then the heaviest professional defeat of Hendry&#x27;s career, surpassing his 1–9 loss to Thorburn in the semi-finals of the 1987 International Open. Afterwards, Hendry stated that his confidence had &quot;drained and drained&quot; and that he would have to go &quot;back to the drawing board&quot; to recover his form. However, at the 1999 World Championship, he defeated O&#x27;Sullivan 17–13 in the semi-finals and Williams 18–11 in the final to win his seventh and last world title at age 30. Hendry held the modern-era record of seven world titles outright for the next 23 years, until O&#x27;Sullivan equalled it in 2022.

===Later career and retirement (1999–2012)===
In the 1999–2000 season, Hendry won the British Open, where he made the fifth 147 break of his career, which was also the first maximum made in a ranking final. However, he suffered a surprise 7–10 defeat to debutant Stuart Bingham in the first round of the 2000 World Championship. In the 2000–01 season, Hendry failed to win any ranking titles for the first time since the 1988–89 season, reaching only one final. In the 2001–02 season, he won the European Open and came close to an eighth world title at the 2002 World Championship, where he defeated the defending champion O&#x27;Sullivan 17–13 in the semi-finals but lost 17–18 to Ebdon in the final. This was Hendry&#x27;s last appearance in a World Championship final, after featuring in nine of the 13 finals held between 1990 and 2002. He made 16 centuries during the 2002 event, a record that stood outright for the next 20 years until Williams equalled it in 2022.

Hendry won the Welsh Open in the 2002–03 season and won the British Open in the 2003–04 season. Returning from the Euro-Asia Masters Challenge in September 2003, he had his cue broken in the luggage hold of his international flight, where players had been required to stow their cues since the 11 September 2001 attacks. Hendry had received the cue as a gift from his parents when he was 14 and had used it when winning all seven of his world titles. Hendry reached the semi-finals of the 2004 World Championship but lost 4–17 to O’Sullivan with a session to spare, his heaviest defeat in a world semi-final. In the 2004–05 season, he was runner-up at the Welsh Open, losing 8–9 to O&#x27;Sullivan. The following month, he defeated fellow Scot Graeme Dott 9–7 to win the Malta Cup, his 36th and last ranking title.

Hendry regained the world number one ranking for the 2005–06 season due to his consistency in reaching the latter stages of tournaments without, by his own admission, reproducing his form of old. It was his ninth season as world number one, which holds the record under the annual ranking system used until 2010. The following season, Hendry took a 4–1 lead over O&#x27;Sullivan in the 2006 UK Championship quarter-finals, only for O&#x27;Sullivan to unexpectedly concede the best-of-17-frame match during the sixth frame. After O&#x27;Sullivan walked out of the arena, Hendry was awarded a 9–1 win. He came from 5–7 down in the semi-finals to defeat Dott 9–7 but lost the final 6–10 to Ebdon. It was the last time Hendry reached a ranking final. Following a disappointing 2007–08 season, he reached his 12th world semi-final at the 2008 World Championship, surpassing Davis&#x27;s previous record of 11 semi-finals. Aged 39, he was the oldest player to reach the semi-finals since Terry Griffiths in 1992, but he lost 6–17 to O&#x27;Sullivan with a session to spare. He lost all eight frames in the second session of the match, his first session whitewash at the Crucible.

Hendry also had a poor 2008–09 season, although his 10–7 win over Williams in the first round of the 2009 World Championship guaranteed that he would remain in the top sixteen of the rankings for the following season. He defeated Ding 13–10 in the second round, winning his 1000th frame at the Crucible. In the quarter-finals, he made a maximum break against Shaun Murphy, but lost the match 11–13. Aged 40, he was at the time the oldest player to make a maximum in a ranking tournament and the second player after O&#x27;Sullivan to make more than one 147 at the Crucible. Hendry ended the season ranked 10th, the first time he had been outside the top eight since the 1987–88 season.

In the 2009–10 season, Hendry reached the quarter-finals of the China Open but lost 4–5 to Mark Allen, despite having led 4–2. In the Masters, he lost 4–6 to Murphy in the first round. In the 2010 World Championship, he lost 5–13 to Mark Selby in the second round. He participated in a challenge match against Ding in Beijing but lost 6–13.
In the 2010–11 season, Hendry defeated White 9–8 in the first round of the 2010 UK Championship but lost 6–9 in the second round to Williams. Afterward, he expressed his frustration with his form and revealed that he has been suffering from &quot;the yips&quot; for ten years, leaving him unable to cue through the ball and causing him to miss routine shots. He lost 3–6 to reigning world champion Neil Robertson in the Masters. He made his tenth professional maximum break at the Welsh Open against Stephen Maguire but lost the match. At the China Open he whitewashed Matthew Stevens 5–0 in the first round, before losing 2–5 to Ding in the second round. At the 2011 World Championship, he beat Joe Perry in a first-round decider but again lost in the second round to Selby, this time by a score of 4–13.

In the 2011–12 season, after losing to Robert Milkins in the first round of the Shanghai Masters, Hendry fell to 21st in the world rankings, ending his 23 years in the top 16. He missed the Masters for the first time since his 1989 debut and had to qualify to reach the main stages of subsequent ranking events. He qualified for the UK Championship but lost 3–6 to Maguire in the first round. He lost 1–5 to James Wattana in the German Masters qualifiers, failing to reach the final stages of a ranking tournament for the first time in 15 years. He qualified for the Welsh Open by whitewashing Kurt Maflin 4–0 and then defeated reigning Masters champion Neil Robertson 4–1 in the first round. However, he lost 0–4 to Mark Allen in the second round. After defeating Mike Dunn 5–2 in qualifying, Hendry played Robertson again in the first round of the World Open but lost 3–5. Hendry defeated Yu Delu 5–1 to qualify for the China Open, where he defeated Martin Gould 5–4 in the first round, winning on the final black. He played Robertson for the third consecutive time in a ranking event but lost 3–5.

Hendry ensured he would make his 27th consecutive appearance at the main stage of the 2012 World Championship when he defeated Yu 10–6 in the qualifiers. He made a 147 in his 10–4 first-round defeat of Bingham, his third maximum break at the Crucible and the 11th of his career. He defeated the defending champion Higgins 13–4 in the second round, his first victory over Higgins in a ranking event since 2003, to reach his 19th world quarter-final. However, after losing 2–13 to Maguire in the quarter-finals, Hendry announced his retirement from professional snooker at the age of 43, citing dissatisfaction with his standard of play and difficulty balancing competitive, commercial, and personal commitments. He stated that he had decided three months earlier to retire at the end of the season.

===Return to the professional tour and second retirement (2020–2024)===
In August 2020, Hendry reached the semi-finals of the World Seniors Championship. The following month, citing improvements in his form and confidence, he accepted a two-year invitational tour card for the main World Snooker Tour. After delaying his return to competition several times during the 2020–21 season, he played his first professional match in almost nine years at the 2021 Gibraltar Open, losing 1–4 to Matthew Selt in the first round. At the 2021 World Championship, he won his first-round qualifier 6–3 against Jimmy White, but he lost 1–6 to Xu Si in the second qualifying round.

During the 2021–22 season, Hendry competed in six ranking events between August and November 2021 but did not progress beyond the last 64 in any of them. He defeated Chris Wakelin 3–2 in the first round of the 2021 British Open, but Gary Wilson whitewashed him 3–0 in the second round. He defeated Michael White 4–1 to qualify for the 2021 English Open but was whitewashed 0–4 in the first round by Wakelin, scoring just 18 points in the match. He lost 0–4 to Allan Taylor in the 2021 Scottish Open qualifiers, 3–5 to Li Hang in the January 2022 European Masters qualifiers, and 2–5 to Gao Yang in the 2022 German Masters qualifiers. After a 1–6 defeat to Thepchaiya Un-Nooh in the first round of the 2021 UK Championship, he did not compete in any further professional events for the remainder of the season. He opted not to enter the 2022 World Championship qualifiers, stating that he had not been practising enough to be competitive, but confirmed that he intended to continue on the tour.

In April 2022, Hendry&#x27;s invitational tour card was renewed for a further two seasons, despite complaints from some players and concerns from snooker&#x27;s governing body about his limited participation on the tour. His 2022–23 season began with a 0–5 whitewash by Mark Joyce in qualifying for the 2022 European Masters and a 1–4 defeat to Zhang Anda in qualifying for the 2022 British Open. He withdrew from the 2022 Northern Ireland Open and also withdrew from the 2022 UK Championship when the qualifying schedule conflicted with his broadcasting work for ITV at the 2022 Champion of Champions. He played his third professional match of the season in the 2023 German Masters qualifiers, where he was whitewashed 0–5 by Matthew Stevens. At the 2023 World Championship, he lost 4–10 in the first qualifying round to his ex-wife&#x27;s nephew James Cahill, after which he said he still had &quot;a very distant dream&quot; that he would one day compete at the Crucible again.

Hendry&#x27;s 2023–24 season began with a 2–4 defeat to Muhammad Asif in qualifying for the 2023 British Open. After losing 0–4 to Fergal O&#x27;Brien in qualifying for the 2023 English Open, Hendry stated in a podcast interview that he was considering retiring again, calling his performances &quot;embarrassing&quot; and acknowledging that he had not been practicing for events. He led Tien Pengfei 2–0 in the 2023 International Championship qualifiers but lost the match 3–6. He lost 2–4 to Matthew Stevens in qualifying for the 2023 Northern Ireland Open and lost by the same score to Ross Muir in qualifying for the 2024 Welsh Open. He opted not to enter the 2024 World Snooker Championship qualifiers, meaning that he finished a second consecutive season without a professional win. In June 2024, he declined the World Snooker Tour&#x27;s offer to renew his invitational tour card for a further two seasons. This marked his second retirement from professional snooker. &quot;I know the game inside out, I still know all the shots, but unfortunately the body is not performing like my brain wants it to,&quot; he stated. He had won just three of the 20 professional matches he played since returning to the tour.

==Status==
At the time of his initial retirement in 2012, Hendry was the most successful player in professional snooker history. He had earned almost £9 million in prize money, more than any other player. He held records for the most world titles in the modern era (7), the most ranking titles (36), the most Triple Crown titles (18), the most centuries in professional competition (775), and (jointly with O&#x27;Sullivan) the most maximum breaks (11). However, O&#x27;Sullivan, as of 2024, has equalled Hendry&#x27;s record of 7 world titles, won 41 ranking titles and 23 Triple Crown titles, and made over 1,200 centuries in professional competition. John Higgins, Neil Robertson, Mark Selby, and Judd Trump have also surpassed Hendry in terms of career century breaks. O&#x27;Sullivan now holds the record for the most maximum breaks, with 15, while Higgins is second with 13.

Dennis Taylor and Ray Reardon have argued that O&#x27;Sullivan has superseded Hendry as the sport&#x27;s greatest player. In 2005, John Higgins, who competed with both players at their respective peaks, proclaimed O&#x27;Sullivan as &quot;the best that&#x27;s ever played the game&quot;. Steve Davis considers O&#x27;Sullivan to be the best player but Hendry the greatest winner. White also regards O&#x27;Sullivan as the best player but considers Davis his toughest opponent. Dell Hill, a snooker coach who has worked with some of the game&#x27;s top players, considers O&#x27;Sullivan the best player &quot;without a shadow of a doubt&quot; but as of 2015 believed that O&#x27;Sullivan had &quot;under-achieved&quot; next to Hendry. Sean Ingle, chief sports journalist for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, has continued to make the case for Hendry as the sport&#x27;s greatest player.

O’Sullivan has dismissed the suggestion that he is the greatest player and has identified Hendry as the greatest due to his having dominated the sport in the 1990s. Hendry himself has identified O’Sullivan as the greatest player he has played against but considers he would triumph in a match if both players played at their peak. After O’Sullivan equalled Hendry&#x27;s seven world titles in 2022, each player paid tribute to the other, with O&#x27;Sullivan saying: &quot;[Hendry] used to play six hours a day and didn&#x27;t miss a ball. There is no one dominating the sport like he did, like Tiger Woods did&quot;. Hendry said of O&#x27;Sullivan during the 2022 World Championship: &quot;You cannot play better snooker than that. He is just supreme in all departments&quot;.

==Personal life==
At age 16, Hendry began dating 17-year-old Amanda Tart. Despite strong disapproval from Hendry&#x27;s then-manager Doyle, who feared that a girlfriend would distract Hendry from snooker, the two continued to see each other. They married on 30 June 1995, shortly after Hendry&#x27;s fifth world title win, and settled in Auchterarder. Their son Blaine was born the following year. The couple struggled to have more children and underwent multiple IVF procedures. In 2003, they had a stillborn son. They subsequently had another son, Carter, born in 2004. Amanda&#x27;s sister Maria married Patrick Cahill; their son James Cahill has also played snooker professionally.

In the 2010s, Hendry underwent financial struggles and divorce. In August 2011, HM Revenue and Customs successfully applied to Glasgow Sheriff Court to liquidate the assets of Stephen Hendry Snooker Ltd, the company set up to manage his sponsorships and promotion, following its failure to pay an £85,000 tax bill. In 2014, two years after his initial retirement, Hendry—then aged 45—left his wife to pursue a relationship with 26-year-old children&#x27;s entertainer and actress Lauren Thundow, whom he had met while she was working at Snooker Legends exhibition events. Hendry and Thundow began living together in the south of England. Amanda Hendry subsequently accused him of cheating on her with a woman half his age, of leaving her &quot;destitute&quot;, and of rarely visiting his children. During divorce proceedings, accountants failed to uncover significant wealth held by Hendry; his wife said she did not know what happened to his tournament winnings, commenting &quot;we never spent any of it&quot;. In 2021, she sold the couple&#x27;s former home in Auchterarder, which she had received as part of their divorce settlement, for around £875,000. 

Hendry&#x27;s father Gordon died from cancer in 2017 at age 68. In 2018, Hendry published his autobiography, &quot;Me and the Table&quot;. In 2022, he launched a YouTube channel, Stephen Hendry&#x27;s Cue Tips, which presents instructional content as well as conversations over frames of snooker with players and other personalities. Hendry has a single-figure golf handicap and enjoys poker and football; he supports Scottish team Hearts of Midlothian.

<doc id="617754" wikidata="Q14583" url="?curid=617754" title="XNU">
<text>XNU (&quot;X is Not Unix&quot;) is the computer operating system (OS) kernel developed at Apple Inc. since December 1996 for use in the Mac OS X (now macOS) operating system and released as free and open-source software as part of the Darwin OS, which, in addition to being the basis for macOS, is also the basis for Apple TV Software, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS.

XNU was originally developed by NeXT for the NeXTSTEP operating system. It was a hybrid kernel derived from version 2.5 of the Mach kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University, which incorporated the bulk of the 4.3BSD kernel modified to run atop Mach primitives, along with an application programming interface (API) in Objective-C for writing drivers named DriverKit.

After Apple acquired NeXT, the kernel was updated with code derived from OSFMK 7.3 from OSF, and the FreeBSD project, and the DriverKit was replaced with new API on a restricted subset of C++ (based on Embedded C++) named IOKit.

==Kernel design==
XNU is a hybrid kernel, containing features of both monolithic kernels and microkernels, attempting to make the best use of both technologies, such as the message passing ability of microkernels enabling greater modularity and larger portions of the OS to benefit from memory protection, and retaining the speed of monolithic kernels for some critical tasks.

, XNU runs on ARM64 and x86-64 processors, both one processor and symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) models. PowerPC support was removed as of the version in Mac OS X Snow Leopard. Support for IA-32 was removed as of the version in Mac OS X Lion; support for 32-bit ARM was removed as of the version in .

===Mach===

The basis of the XNU kernel is a heavily modified (hybrid) Open Software Foundation Mach kernel (OSFMK) 7.3. OSFMK 7.3 is a microkernel that includes applicable code from the University of Utah Mach 4 kernel and from the many Mach 3.0 variants forked from the original Carnegie Mellon University Mach 3.0 microkernel.

OSFMK 7.3 is able to run the core of an operating system as separated processes, which allows a great flexibility (it could run several operating systems in parallel above the Mach core), but this often reduces performance because of time-consuming kernel/user mode context switches and overhead stemming from mapping or copying messages between the address spaces of the kernel and that of the service daemons.

Apple licensed OSFMK 7.3 from the OSF, and attempted to streamline some tasks by building BSD functions into the kernel along with the Mach code. The result is a heavily modified (hybrid) OSFMK 7.3 kernel.

===BSD===
The Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) part of the kernel provides the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) application programming interface (API, BSD system calls), the Unix process model atop Mach tasks, basic security policies, user and group ids, permissions, the network protocol stack (protocols), the virtual file system code (including a file system independent journaling layer), several local file systems such as Hierarchical File System (HFS, HFS Plus (HFS+)) and Apple File System (APFS), the Network File System (NFS) client and server, cryptographic framework, UNIX System V inter-process communication (IPC), audit subsystem, mandatory access control, and some of the locking primitives. The BSD code present in XNU has been most recently synchronised with that from the FreeBSD kernel. Although much of it has been significantly modified, code sharing still occurs between Apple and the FreeBSD Project .

===K32/K64===

XNU in Mac OS X Snow Leopard, v10.6, (Darwin version 10) comes in two varieties, a 32-bit version called &quot;K32&quot; and a 64-bit version called &quot;K64&quot;. K32 can run 64-bit applications in userland. What was new in Mac OS X 10.6 was the ability to run XNU in 64-bit kernel space. K32 was the default kernel for 10.6 &quot;Server&quot; when used on all machines except Mac Pro and Xserve models from 2008 onwards and can run 64-bit applications. K64 has several benefits compared to K32:

* Can manage more than 32 GB RAM, as the memory map would consume a disproportionately large area of the 32-bit kernel space.
* Cache buffer sizes can be larger than what the 32-bit kernel space allows, potentially increasing I/O performance.
* Performance is increased when using high-performance networking devices or multiple graphics processing units (GPUs), as the kernel can map all of the devices in 64-bit space even if several have very large direct memory access (DMA) buffers.
Booting while holding down &quot;6&quot; and &quot;4&quot; forces the machine to boot K64 on machines supporting 64-bit kernels. K64 will run 32-bit applications but it will not run 32-bit kernel extensions (KEXTs), so these must be ported to K64 to be able to load.

XNU in OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) and later only provides a 64-bit kernel.

===IOKit===
IOKit is the device driver framework, written in a subset of C++ based on Embedded C++. Using its object-oriented design, features common to any class of driver are provided within the framework, helping device drivers be written in less time and code. IOKit is multi-threaded, symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)-safe, and allows for hot-pluggable devices and automatic, dynamic device configuration.

Many drivers can be written to run in user mode, which further enhances the stability of the system. If a driver running in user mode crashes, it will not crash the kernel. However, if a driver running in kernel mode crashes it will crash the kernel. Examples of drivers running in kernel mode include disk adapter and network adapter drivers, graphics drivers, drivers for Universal Serial Bus (USB) and FireWire host controllers, and drivers for virtual machine software such as VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop for Mac, and VMware Fusion. In macOS Catalina and later releases, DriverKit allows some of those types of drivers to run in user mode.

<doc id="617756" wikidata="Q204598" url="?curid=617756" title="Karl Offmann">
<text>Karl Auguste Offmann, GCSK (25 November 1940 – 12 March 2022) was a Mauritian politician who briefly served as the president of Mauritius from 2002 to 2003.

After two of his successive predecessors had resigned over their refusal to sign a controversial anti-terrorism bill, the parliament elected Offmann to serve as the third president on 25 February 2002. He served in the post until Paul Bérenger became his prime minister and nominated a new president on 1 October 2003.

== Educational and professional background ==
Because secondary education was not free, his family could not afford to meet the costs of education for seven children. Thus, when he completed primary school education, he chose to compete for a scholarship in order to pursue his studies further. He won the government-awarded mechanical Engineering Apprenticeship Scholarship in 1956 and secured a seat at the prestigious Royal College School and the Technical College of Floreal. To acquire practical knowledge and experience, he was trained at the Mauritius Railways Department where he stayed up to 1963. In that same year, he was approached by the team of the Daily Express to work as a technician in the composition sector. He worked for the paper until 1979 when he was offered the post of Director of Father Laval&#x27;s Printing, a company owned by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Port-Louis and for which he worked until 1983. From 1983 to 1986 he was Director of the Daily Socialist, a publication which belonged to a political party. In 1975, he obtained the Diploma of Political and Social Sciences at Claver House, London.

== Social work ==
Offman joined the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative in 1957, where he became deeply involved in the overall strategy of the movement with regard to its information campaign and training programme. The programme was in favour of the working youth of the Indian Ocean Islands and on the African Continent as well on the international scene.

In 1964, he was selected by the Mauritian Branch of the JOCI to participate in the first International Training Course. It committed him to fight illiteracy, poverty other social evils on the international plane.

On his return from this training course in 1965, he was appointed Member of the Commission of African Studies. From 1966 to 1968, he was responsible for coordinating JOCI activities within the Indian Ocean Islands and from 1966 to 1969, he was a Member of the African Team and of the executive committee. It was only during the period 1966 to 1969, while he was the coordinator of activities within the Indian Ocean Islands that he took two years’ leave from in order to devote himself fully to social and voluntary work. One of the highlights of this period was the Meeting of the JOCI Indian Ocean Islands in 1967 which was attended by, among others, a South African delegate during the days of apartheid. Another significant event was the first Meet of the African Continent in Yaoundé, Cameroon in 1968, which was organised exclusively by the African Team of the JOCI, composed of African delegates including himself. The others were France Tévi Sedalo, Mathias Dossoumon and Frédéric Jean Njougla. For its preparation, he put in his personal efforts for three-and-a-half months, working in situ.

After his marriage in 1969, he left the JOCI and the Bishop of Port-Louis entrusted to him the Presidency of the Commission of Lay Apostolate in Mauritius. While working in the Daily Express, he promoted the diocese. His position, though very favourable professionally and financially, did not fit his aspirations and his JOCI experience.

== Political career ==
Offmann was a full-time politician from 1976 to 2002. At the 1976 General Elections he was a candidate of Guy Ollivry&#x27;s party, the Union Démocratique Mauricienne (UDM), in Constituency No. 1 Grand River North West and Port Louis West but he was defeated by his rivals of the MMM (Jack Bizlall, Jerome Boulle and Rajnee Dyalah). He left the UDM and stood as candidate of Harish Boodhoo&#x27;s party Parti Socialiste Mauricien (PSM) in 1978. At the June 1982 General Elections he was a candidate of the MMM-PSM coalition in Constituency No. 17 Curepipe Midlands where he was elected for the first time as a member of the Legislative Assembly. At the August 1983 General Elections he was elected as a member of the MSM-Labour Party coalition in Constituency No.16 Vacoas Floréal. At the 1987 General Elections he was not elected after standing as candidate of the MSM-Labour coalition in Constituency No.16, but was deemed to be one of the 8 Best Losers. In September 1991 he was elected in Constituency No.16 as candidate of MSM-MMM coalition, defeating his rivals Sir Gaetan Duval, Marie-France Roussety and Motteepath Fowdur. But as a candidate of the MSM-RMM Coalition at the 1995 General Elections he was defeated in the same Constituency by his rivals Lallah, Sakaram, and Arouff-Parfait of the Labour-MMM coalition.

He served successively as Minister of Economic Planning and Development (August 1983), Minister of Local Government and Cooperatives (1984 – 1986), Minister of Social Security, National Solidarity and Reform Institutions (January 1988 – 1991) and as Government Chief Whip (1988 – 1991). From 1987 to 1991, he was General Secretary of the MSM which he helped to set up, and from 1996 to February 2000, he served as party leader.

One of his first missions in Washington (as Minister of Economic Planning and Development) was to convince the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to not press for drastic reductions in the Civil Service Staff and not do away with free education and free health services. Today, 44% of the overall wealth produced goes back to the people in the form of free education and Health Services, Social Security and other social services like Youth and Sports, Women&#x27;s Rights, Co-operatives, Housing, Arts and Culture etc.

=== President ===
In February 2002, he was elected president by the National Assembly which he held until October 2003.

==Awards and decorations==
** Grand Commander of the Order of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean (2002)

== Personal life and death==
Offmann was married to Marie Rose Danielle Moutou and they had two sons, Gilles Bernard and Hans Erick. Both are married. He was grandfather of Paul Alexandre, Mark Philip, Victoria, Adriana and Chloe.

Offmann died on 12 March 2022, at the age of 81.

<doc id="617761" wikidata="Q275872" url="?curid=617761" title="Symphony No. 9 (Shostakovich)">
<text>The Symphony No. 9 in E-flat major, Op. 70, was composed by Dmitri Shostakovich in 1945. It was premiered on 3 November 1945 in Leningrad by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra under Yevgeny Mravinsky.

==History==
===Development===
The Ninth Symphony was originally intended to be a celebration of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Shostakovich declared in October 1943 that the symphony would be a large composition for orchestra, soloists, and chorus.

Shostakovich told his students on 16 January 1945 that he had begun work on a new symphony the day before. A week later, he told them that he had reached the middle of the development section, and the work was going to open with a big tutti. Isaak Glikman heard around ten minutes of the music Shostakovich had written for the first movement in late April. Soon thereafter, Shostakovich stopped working on the symphony. He resumed work on 26 July 1945 and finished on 30 August 1945. The resulting symphony was unrelated to the one he had originally planned.

===Premières===
Shostakovich and Sviatoslav Richter played the Ninth Symphony in a four-hand arrangement for musicians and cultural officials in early September 1945. The premiere, conducted by Yevgeny Mravinsky, took place on 3 November 1945 in the opening concert of the 25th season of the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra, sharing the program with Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 5. The concert was broadcast live on the radio.

The Moscow premiere took place on 20 November 1945. A possible draft for the first movement of the original version of the Ninth Symphony, published as &quot;Symphonic Fragment&quot;, was conducted by Gennady Rozhdestvensky on 20 November 2006. A Naxos CD containing a recording of the &quot;Symphonic Fragment&quot; was released in 2009.

===Reception===
Shostakovich remarked that &quot;musicians will like to play it, and critics will delight in blasting it&quot;. The initial reaction of his peers to the new symphony was generally favourable:

Soviet critics censured the symphony for its &quot;ideological weakness&quot; and its failure to &quot;reflect the true spirit of the people of the Soviet Union&quot;. On 20 September 1946, a highly critical article by musicologist Izrail Nestyev was published:

The symphony was also coolly received in the West: &quot;The Russian composer should not have expressed his feelings about the defeat of Nazism in such a childish manner&quot; (&quot;New York World-Telegram&quot;, 27 July 1946).

The Ninth Symphony was nominated for the Stalin Prize in 1946, but did not win. By order of Glavrepertkom, the central censorship board, the work was banned on 14 February 1948 in his second denunciation together with some other works by the composer. It was removed from the list in the summer of 1955 when the symphony was performed and broadcast.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for:
;Woodwinds:
:Piccolo
:2 Flutes
:2 Oboes
:2 Clarinets in B and A
:2 Bassoons

;Brass:
:4 Horns
:2 Trumpets
:3 Trombones
: Tuba

;Percussion:
:Timpani
:Snare drum
:Bass drum
:Cymbals
:Triangle
:Tambourine

;Strings:
:1st Violins
:2nd Violins
:Violas
:Cellos
:Double basses
==Form==
The work has five movements, the last three played without interruption:

A typical performance lasts for around 26 minutes, which makes this symphony one of Shostakovich&#x27;s shortest.

<text>The Symphony No. 13 in B-flat minor, Op. 113 for bass soloist, bass chorus, and large orchestra was composed by Dmitri Shostakovich in 1962. It consists of five movements, each a setting of a Yevgeny Yevtushenko poem that describes aspects of Soviet history and life. Although the symphony is commonly referred to by the nickname Babi Yar, no such subtitle is designated in Shostakovich&#x27;s manuscript score.

The symphony was completed on July 20, 1962, and first performed in Moscow on December 18 of that year. Kirill Kondrashin conducted the premiere after Yevgeny Mravinsky declined the assignment. Vitaly Gromadsky sang the solo part alongside the basses of the and the Moscow Philharmonic.

== Movements ==

The symphony consists of five movements.

:: In this movement, Shostakovich and Yevtushenko transform the 1941 massacre by Nazis of Jews at Babi Yar, near Kiev, into a denunciation of anti-Semitism in all its forms. (Although a monument was not erected at Babi Yar by the Soviet government, it still became a place of pilgrimage for Soviet Jews.) Shostakovich sets the poem as a series of theatrical episodes — the Dreyfus affair, the Białystok pogrom and the story of Anne Frank — extended interludes in the main theme of the poem, lending the movement the dramatic structure and theatrical imagery of opera while resorting to graphic illustration and vivid word painting. For instance, the mocking of the imprisoned Dreyfus by poking umbrellas at him through the prison bars may be in an accentuated pair of eighth notes in the brass, with the build-up of menace in the Anne Frank episode, culminating in the musical image of the breaking down of the door to the Franks&#x27; hiding place, which underlines the hunting down of that family.

:: Shostakovich quotes from the third of his &quot;Six Romances on Verses by British Poets&quot;, Op. 62 (Robert Burns&#x27; &quot;Macpherson Before His Execution&quot;) to colour Yevtushenko&#x27;s imagery of the spirit of mockery, endlessly murdered and endlessly resurrected, denouncing the vain attempts of tyrants to shackle wit. The movement is a Mahlerian gesture of mocking burlesque, not simply light or humorous but witty, satirical and parodistic.

:: This movement is about the hardship of Soviet women queueing in a shop. This arouses Shostakovich&#x27;s compassion no less than racial prejudice and gratuitous violence. Written in the form of a lament, the chorus departs from its unison line in the music&#x27;s two concluding harmonized chords for the only time in the entire symphony, ending on a plagal cadence functioning much the same as a liturgical amen.

:: This movement touches on the subject of suppression in the Soviet Union and is the most elaborate musically of the symphony&#x27;s five movements, using a variety of musical ideas to stress its message, from an angry march to alternating soft and violent episodes.

::Harmonic ambiguity instills a deep sense of unease as the chorus intones the first lines of the poem: &quot;Fears are dying-out in Russia.&quot; (&quot;Умирают в России страхи.&quot;) Shostakovich breaks this mood only in response to Yevtushenko&#x27;s agitprop lines, &quot;We weren&#x27;t afraid/of construction work in blizzards/or of going into battle under shell-fire,&quot; (&quot;Не боялись мы строить в метели, / уходить под снарядами в бой,) parodying the Soviet marching song &quot;Smelo tovarishchi v nogu&quot; (&quot;Bravely, comrades, march to step&quot;).
:: While this movement opens with a pastoral duet by flutes over a B pedal bass, giving the musical effect of sunshine after a storm, it is an ironic attack on bureaucrats, touching on cynical self-interest and robotic unanimity while also a tribute to genuine creativity. The soloist comes onto equal terms with the chorus, with sarcastic commentary provided by the bassoon and other wind instruments, as well as rude squeaking from the trumpets. It also relies more than the other movements on purely orchestral passages as links between vocal statements.

==Overview==

===Background===
Yevtushenko&#x27;s poem &quot;Babi Yar&quot; appeared in the &quot;Literaturnaya Gazeta&quot; in September 1961 and, along with the publication of Alexander Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s novel &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; in &quot;Novy Mir&quot;, happened during a surge of anti-Stalinist literature during the premiership of Nikita Khrushchev. Publishers began receiving more anti-Stalinist novels, short stories and memoirs. This fad soon faded.

According to Edison Denisov, Shostakovich had always loathed anti-Semitism.

===Composition===

The symphony was originally intended as a single-movement &quot;vocal-symphonic poem&quot;. By the end of May, Shostakovich had found three additional poems by Yevtushenko, which caused him to expand the work into a multi-movement choral symphony by complementing &quot;Babi Yar&#x27;s&quot; theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko&#x27;s verses about other Soviet abuses. Yevtushenko wrote the text for the 4th movement, &quot;Fears,&quot; at the composer&#x27;s request. The composer completed these four additional movements within six weeks, putting the final touches on the symphony on July 20, 1962, during a hospital stay. Discharged that day, he took the night train to Kiev to show the score to bass Boris Gmyrya, an artist he especially admired and wanted to sing the solo part in the work. From there he went to Leningrad to give the score to conductor Yevgeny Mravinsky.

Yevtushenko remembered, on hearing the composer play and sing the complete symphony for him,

Yevtushenko added, about the composer&#x27;s setting of &quot;Babi Yar&quot; that &quot;if I were to able to write music I would have written it exactly the way Shostakovich did... His music made the poem greater, more meaningful and powerful. In a word, it became a much better poem.&quot;

===Growing controversy===
By the time Shostakovich had completed the first movement on 27 March 1962, Yevtushenko was already being subjected to a campaign of criticism, as he was now considered a political liability. Khrushchev&#x27;s agents engendered a campaign to discredit him, accusing the poet of placing the suffering of the Jewish people above that of the Russians. The intelligentsia called him a &quot;boudoir poet&quot; — in other words, a moralist. Shostakovich defended the poet in a letter dated 26 October 1965, to his pupil Boris Tishchenko:

For the Party, performing critical texts at a public concert with symphonic backing had a potentially much greater impact than simply reading the same texts at home privately. It should be no surprise, then, that Khrushchev criticized it before the premiere, and threatened to stop its performance,

By mid-August 1962, Gmyrya had withdrawn from the premiere under pressure from the local Party Committee; writing the composer, he claimed that, in view of the dubious text, he declined to perform the work. Mravinsky soon followed suit, though he excused himself for other than political reasons. Shostakovich then asked Kirill Kondrashin to conduct the work. Two singers were engaged, Victor Nechipailo to sing the premiere and Vitaly Gromadsky in case a substitute were needed. Nechipailo was forced to drop out at the last minute (to cover at the Bolshoi Theatre for a singer who had been ordered to &quot;get sick&quot; in a performance of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlo&quot;, according to Vishnevskaya&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Galina: A Russian Story&quot;, page 278). Kondrashin was also asked to withdraw but refused. He was then put under pressure to drop the first movement.

===Premiere===

Official interference continued throughout the day of the concert. Cameras originally slated to televise the piece were noisily dismantled. The entire choir threatened to walk out; a desperate speech by Yevtushenko was all that kept them from doing so. The premiere finally went ahead on December 18, 1962 with the government box empty but the theatre otherwise packed. The symphony played to a tremendous ovation. Kondrashin remembered, &quot;At the end of the first movement the audience started to applaud and shout hysterically. The atmosphere was tense enough as it was, and I waved at them to calm down. We started playing the second movement at once, so as not to put Shostakovich into an awkward position.&quot; Sculptor Ernst Neizvestny, who was present, said, &quot;It was major! There was a sense of something incredible happening. The interesting part was that when the symphony ended, there was no applause at first, just an unusually long pause—so long that I even thought that it might be some sort of conspiracy. But then the audience burst into wild applause with shouts of &#x27;Bravo!&#x27;&quot;

=== Changed lines ===
Kondrashin gave two performances of the Thirteenth Symphony; a third was scheduled for 15 January 1963. However, at the beginning of 1963 Yevtushenko reportedly published a second, now politically correct version of &quot;Babi Yar&quot; twice the length of the original. The length of the new version can be explained not only by changes in content but also by a noticeable difference in writing style. It might be possible that Yevtushenko intentionally changed his style of narrative to make it clear that the modified version of the text is not something he initially intended. While Shostakovich biographer Laurel Fay maintains that such a volume has yet to surface, the fact remains that Yevtushenko wrote new lines for the eight most offensive ones questioned by the authorities.

The rest of the poem is as strongly aimed at the Soviet political authorities as those lines that were changed so the reasons for these changes were more precise. Not wanting to set the new version to music, yet knowing the original version faced little chance of performance, the composer agreed to the performance of the new version yet did not add those lines to the manuscript of the symphony.

:Original Version
:Мне кажется сейчас – я иудей.
:Вот я бреду по древнему Египту.
:А вот я, на кресте распятый, гибну,
:и до сих пор на мне – следы гвоздей.
:И сам я, как сплошной беззвучный крик,
:над тысячами тысяч погребённых.
:Я – каждый здесь расстрелянный старик.
:Я – каждый здесь расстрелянный ребёнок.

:Censored Version
:Я тут стою, как будто у криницы,
:дающей веру в наше братство мне.
:Здесь русские лежат и украинцы,
:с евреями лежат в одной земле..
:Я думаю о подвиге России,
:фашизму преградившей путь собой,
:до самой наикрохотной росинки
:мне близкой всею сутью и судьбой.

:Original Version
:I feel myself a Jew.
:Here I tread across old Egypt.
:Here I die, nailed to the cross.
:And even now I bear the scars of it.
:I become a gigantic, soundless scream
:Above the thousands buried here.
:I am every old man shot dead here.
:I am every child shot dead here.

:Censored Version
:Here I stand at the fountainhead
:That gives me faith in brotherhood.
:Here Russians lie, and Ukrainians
:Together with Jews in the same ground.
:I think of Russia&#x27;s heroic dead
:In blocking the way to Fascism.
:To the smallest dew-drop, she is close to me
:In her being and her fate.
Even with these changed lines, the symphony enjoyed relatively few performances — two with the revised text in Moscow in February 1963, one performance in Minsk (with the original text, conductor Vitaly Katayev) shortly afterward, as well as Gorky, Leningrad and Novosibirsk. After these performances, the work was effectively banned in the Soviet bloc, the work&#x27;s premiere in East Berlin occurring only because the local censor had forgotten to clear the performance with Moscow beforehand. Meanwhile, a copy of the score with the original text was smuggled to the West, where it was premiered and recorded in January 1970 by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy.

Second to the &quot;Babi Yar&quot; movement, &quot;Fears&quot; was the most viciously attacked of the movements by the bureaucrats. To keep the symphony in performance, seven lines of the poem were altered, replacing references to imprisonment without trial, to neglect of the poor and to the fear experienced by artists.

===Influence of Mussorgsky===
Shostakovich&#x27;s orchestration of Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, &quot;Khovanshchina&quot; and &quot;Songs and Dances of Death&quot; had an important bearing on the Thirteenth Symphony, as well as on Shostakovich&#x27;s late work. Shostakovich wrote the greater part of his vocal music after his immersion in Mussorgsky&#x27;s work, and his method of writing for the voice in small intervals, with much tonal repetition and attention to natural declamation, can be said to have been taken directly from Mussorgsky.

<doc id="617766" wikidata="Q188073" url="?curid=617766" title="Symphony No. 14 (Shostakovich)">
<text>The Symphony No. 14 in G minor, Op. 135, by Dmitri Shostakovich was completed in the spring of 1969, and was premiered later that year. It is a work for soprano, bass and a small string orchestra with percussion, consisting of eleven linked settings of poems by four authors. Most of the poems deal with the theme of death, particularly that of unjust or early death. They were set in Russian, although two other versions of the work exist with the texts all back-translated from Russian either into their original languages or into German. The symphony is dedicated to Benjamin Britten (who gave the UK premiere the following year at Aldeburgh).

==Instrumentation==

Besides the soloists, the symphony is scored for a chamber orchestra consisting only of strings and percussion. The strings consist of ten violins, four violas, three cellos, and two double basses, and the percussion section (two players) includes wood block, castanets, whip, soprano, alto and tenor tom-toms, xylophone, tubular bells, vibraphone, and celesta. The percussion section does not include common instruments such as timpani, bass drum, cymbals, or triangle.

==Movements==

The work has eleven linked movements, each a setting of a poem, with a total duration of around 50 minutes:

The first movement begins with the violins playing a theme reminiscent of the Dies irae, which plays a prominent role in the history of Russian music. Fragments of the theme are developed in various sections throughout the symphony; it recurs in its entirety in the climactic penultimate movement.

The work shows Shostakovich&#x27;s willingness to adopt new techniques. All but two of the movements include themes using tone rows, which he uses to convey a sense of the abstract. He also makes dramatic use of tone clusters, such as the fortissimo chord illustrating the lily growing from the suicide&#x27;s mouth in the fourth movement.

==Overview==
===Composition===
The Fourteenth Symphony was a creative response to Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Songs and Dances of Death&quot;, which Shostakovich had orchestrated in 1962. Like Mussorgsky, Shostakovich brings back the subject of death in various images and situations. The Mussorgsky cycle contains only four songs — too few to do justice to Mussorgsky&#x27;s concept, Shostakovich felt. He proceeded to expand it by selecting 11 poems by Federico García Lorca, Guillaume Apollinaire, Wilhelm Küchelbecker and Rainer Maria Rilke.

Shostakovich attached great importance to this work, commenting in a letter to Glikman: &quot;Everything that I have written until now over these long years has been a preparation for this work.&quot; He added that he intended the symphony to prove a counterweight to the positive presentation of death in music:

&quot;In part, I am trying to polemicise with the great classics who touched upon the theme of death in their work... Remember the death of Boris Godunov. When ... he dies, then a kind of brightening sets in. Remember Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;. When the whole tragedy ends, and Desdemona and Otello die, we also experience a beautiful tranquility. Remember &quot;Aida&quot;. When the tragic demise of the hero and heroine occurs, it is softened with radiant music.&quot;
In Mussorgsky&#x27;s song cycle Shostakovich found a model that spoke out against death; in his symphony, he attempted to expand this protest still further. The composer wrote in his preface to the score:

I want listeners to reflect upon my new symphony ... to realise that they must lead pure and fruitful lives for the glory of their Motherland, their people and the most progressive ideas motivating our socialist society. That is what I was thinking about as I wrote my new work. I want my listeners, as they leave the hall after hearing my symphony, to think that life is truly beautiful.

While Shostakovich&#x27;s intent may have been to emphasise that life is truly beautiful, he did so by starkly underlining the opposite — that the end of life is ugly and irredeemably negative. Toward this end, Shostakovich&#x27;s music is sober in nature, and the composer was soon to extend these ideas in his last four string quartets as musical reflections on the themes of suffering and death. As in his orchestration of &quot;Songs&quot;, his orchestration of the symphony is spare but extremely imaginative. His writing for the voice is in small intervals, with much tonal repetition and attention paid to natural declamation. This practice is taken directly from Mussorgsky.

===Premieres===
The work received its official premiere in Leningrad on 29 September 1969 by the Moscow Chamber Orchestra under Rudolf Barshai. Four singers were involved in the first presentations of the work: the sopranos Galina Vishnevskaya and Margarita Miroshnikova, and the basses and Yevgeny Vladimirov. An initial performance, preceding the official Moscow and Leningrad premieres, was given by Miroshnikova and Vladimirov, but sources differ as to the vocalists in the official premieres. The official premiere recording on Melodiya was with Miroshnikova and Vladimirov.

The pre-premiere performance on 21 June 1969 was attended by Pavel Apostolov, one of the composer&#x27;s fiercest critics. He suffered a heart attack during the fifth movement. He died on 19 July.

The UK premiere was held at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1970 and was conducted by the dedicatee, Benjamin Britten.

===Criticism===
The composer himself was initially unsure what to call the work, eventually designating it a symphony rather than a song cycle to emphasise the unity of the work musically and philosophically: most of the poems deal with the subject of mortality (he rejected the title oratorio because the work lacks a chorus; it is not a choral symphony for the same reason).

Not all the movements are linked; there are a few breaks between movements that effectively divide the work into a &quot;conventional&quot; four-movement structure.

Many at the time (including Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Lev Lebedinsky) criticised the work as too pessimistic. Wilson argues that on the contrary &quot;through careful ordering of the texts [he] conveys a specific message of protest at the arbitrary power exercised by dictators in sending the innocent to their deaths&quot; (p. 411).

Shostakovich reportedly answered his critics in &quot;Testimony&quot;:

[My critics] read this idea in the Fourteenth Symphony: &quot;death is all-powerful.&quot; They wanted the finale to be comforting, to say that death is only the beginning. But it&#x27;s not a beginning, it&#x27;s the real end, there will be nothing afterwards, nothing. I feel you must look truth right in the eyes ... To deny death and its power is useless. Deny it or not, you&#x27;ll die anyway ... It&#x27;s stupid to protest against death as such, but you can and must protest against violent death. It&#x27;s bad when people die before their time from disease or poverty, but it&#x27;s worse when a man is killed by another man.

The absence from the symphony of redemption or transcendence drew protests not only in the Soviet Union but also in the West, where the work was considered both obsessive and limited spiritually. Shostakovich was determined to avoid false consolation. This intent was a prime stimulus in writing the work. Some have found that the work&#x27;s embracing of human mortality has been expressed with tremendous clarity. Others have found the work bleakly pessimistic and, especially in its opening &quot;De Profundis&quot;, virtually nihilistic. Regardless of opinion, the Fourteenth in performance is agreed to be a profound and powerful experience.

<doc id="617767" wikidata="Q112765" url="?curid=617767" title="Symphony No. 15 (Shostakovich)">
<text>The Symphony No. 15 in A major, Op. 141, composed between late 1970 and July 29, 1971, is the final symphony by Dmitri Shostakovich. It was his first purely instrumental and non-programmatic symphony since the Tenth from 1953. Shostakovich began to plan and sketch the Fifteenth in late 1970, with the intention of composing for himself a cheerful work to mark his 65th birthday the next year. After completing the sketch score in April 1971, he wrote the orchestral score in June while receiving medical treatment in the town of Kurgan. The symphony was completed the following month at his summer dacha in Repino. This was followed by a prolonged period of creative inactivity which did not end until the composition of the Fourteenth Quartet in 1973.

The Fifteenth Symphony was first performed privately in a reduction for two pianos for members of the Union of Soviet Composers and invited guests in August 1971. Its scheduled world premiere in September was postponed when Shostakovich suffered his second heart attack earlier that month. Following a two-month hospitalization, Shostakovich recovered well enough to attend rehearsals for the Fifteenth&#x27;s premiere starting in late December 1971. The premiere took place in Moscow on January 8, 1972, performed by the All-Union Radio and Television Symphony Orchestra conducted by Maxim Shostakovich. The Western hemisphere premiere took place in Philadelphia on September 28, 1972 with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy. Immediate critical reaction to the symphony was overwhelmingly positive in the Soviet Union, but mixed in the West.

Shostakovich&#x27;s extensive use of musical quotation in the Fifteenth has attracted speculation since its premiere. He initially likened the first movement to a &quot;toyshop&quot;, but later cautioned listeners against taking his description too precisely. A quotation from Gioacchino Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot; Overture recurs throughout the first movement, while the last movement quotes from a song by Mikhail Glinka and from Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; and &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. Critics have also detected in the symphony further quotations and allusions, from other composers as well as Shostakovich&#x27;s own music. Bernard Jacobson wrote in 1972 that the symphony&#x27;s lasting appeal was secured because it made use of &quot;one of [Shostakovich&#x27;s] greatest expressive assets—a teasing and often powerfully affective emotional ambivalence&quot;.

==History==
===Composition===

Shostakovich began to prepare the Fifteenth Symphony in late 1970. It was originally planned as a present to himself for his 65th birthday. He wrote to Boris Tishchenko that he wanted to write a &quot;merry symphony&quot;. Shostakovich completed a sketch outline of the Fifteenth Symphony totaling 18 pages, which used spare notation and extensive shorthand, by no later than April 2, 1971. The sketch manuscript also includes an unfinished and still unpublished setting of Yevgeny Yevtushenko&#x27;s &quot;Yelabuga Nail&quot;, a poem about the suicide of Marina Tsvetayeva.

That June, Shostakovich traveled with his wife to the clinic of Gavriil Ilizarov in Kurgan to continue treatment for his poliomyelitis, which he had been receiving since 1968. While there he began the final draft of the Fifteenth Symphony. He wrote to Marietta Shaginyan that he was working himself to the &quot;verge of tears&quot;:

Shostakovich later made similar remarks to Sofia Khentova, telling her that the symphony did not &quot;allow [him] a moment&#x27;s rest&quot;:

Veniamin Basner recalled that the composer complained to him that work on the finale progressed too slowly.

Shostakovich continued work on the symphony after he left the clinic for his summer dacha in Repino. On July 13, he was visited there by his friend Isaak Glikman, to whom the composer declared that he had completed the first two movements and was working on the third. Shostakovich told him that he still had to &quot;put together a finale, but, you know, somewhat like my Ninth, the symphony lacks a basic idea&quot;. Shostakovich completed the symphony on July 29 in the presence of Basner. &quot;The new symphony is still warm and I like it&quot;, Shostakovich told Glikman. &quot;But, perhaps after some time has gone by, I will think about it differently&quot;. In a letter to Krzysztof Meyer dated September 16, Shostakovich said: &quot;I finished another symphony—my Fifteenth. Maybe I should not compose anymore, but I cannot live without it&quot;. Shostakovich wrote to Shaginyan on August 26 that the completion of the symphony he had &quot;worked on day and night&quot; left him feeling as if in a void.

Subsequent to the symphony&#x27;s completion, Shostakovich experienced a prolonged period of creative inactivity. Aside from an arrangement of the &quot;Serenade&quot; by Gaetano Braga, which was intended for an unrealized projected opera based on Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Black Monk&quot;), Shostakovich composed nothing again until the Fourteenth Quartet in March 1973.

===Premiere===

Shortly after Shostakovich completed the Fifteenth, he informed his son Maxim, to whom its premiere was eventually entrusted. Kirill Kondrashin, the composer&#x27;s first choice, had suddenly been stricken with severe heart problems that summer and was unable to conduct. On the same day that Shostakovich completed the symphony, he and his wife returned home to Moscow. There he heard the symphony for the first time, played by Boris Tchaikovsky and Mieczysław Weinberg in a reduction for two pianos.

The completed score of the Fifteenth Symphony was sent to copyists at the Union of Soviet Composers by September 9 in preparation for its world premiere, which had been announced for autumn 1971. A few days later, on September 17, Shostakovich suffered his second heart attack, which required the postponement of the symphony&#x27;s first performance. He was in the hospital until November 28, whereupon he was released to continue recovery at a sanatorium in Barvikha. Despite continued weakness in Shostakovich&#x27;s arms and legs, his health had recovered sufficiently to allow him to attend the rehearsals for the rescheduled premiere. It eventually took place at the Large Hall of the Moscow Conservatory on January 8, 1972, performed by the All-Union Radio and Television Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Maxim Shostakovich; he also conducted the British premiere with the New Philharmonia Orchestra on November 20, 1972. Leopold Stokowski had vied for the rights to conduct the American premiere, but lost to Eugene Ormandy, who performed it with the Philadelphia Orchestra on September 28, 1972.

==Music==
The symphony consists of four movements, the middle two played without interruption.

A typical performance lasts approximately 45 minutes.

The first movement begins with two chimes on the glockenspiel, followed by a five-note motif on solo flute, accompanied by pizzicato strings. This leads into a galloping motif for trumpet constructed out of all twelve notes of the Western chromatic scale. Hugh Ottaway observed that Shostakovich&#x27;s use of such motifs in this symphony create an &quot;enlarged tonal field in which &#x27;chromatic&#x27; and &#x27;diatonic&#x27; cease to be meaningful distinctions&quot;. Recurring throughout the movement are quotations from Gioacchino Rossini&#x27;s overture to his opera &quot;William Tell&quot;.

A brass chorale opens the second movement, which gives way to a cello solo. These themes alternate with a dotted funereal motif introduced by a pair of solo flutes, then taken up by a solo trombone, which builds up to a &quot;fortississimo&quot; climax. A muted string restatement of the opening chorale fades away on a timpani roll, after which bassoons announce the start of the &quot;scherzando&quot; third movement.

The finale contains several quotations, starting with the &quot;fate motif&quot; from Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, then the opening motif from his &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, before segueing into a reminiscence of Mikhail Glinka&#x27;s &quot;Do Not Tempt Me Needlessly&quot;. A passacaglia theme which has drawn commentary for its resemblance to the march from Shostakovich&#x27;s Seventh Symphony builds to another powerful climax. The symphony ends with the celesta restating the symphony&#x27;s opening motif, followed by an open A-major chord sustained over a percussion part that recalls the scherzo of his Fourth Symphony, which is finally resolved by a three-octave C-sharp.

==Instrumentation==
The orchestra consists of the following instruments.

;Woodwinds
:Piccolo
:2 Flutes
:2 Oboes
:2 Clarinets in A
:2 Bassoons

;Strings
:1st Violins
:2nd Violins

The Fifteenth Symphony&#x27;s use of a large percussion section aside, it is scored for forces smaller than those employed in Shostakovich&#x27;s First. The composer indicated in the score that the number of instruments listed were the minimum required, but &quot;if there are more, then it would be better&quot;.

==Reception==
Upon hearing its first performance, Shostakovich remarked that he had composed a &quot;wicked symphony&quot;. It was received with an ovation by the audience at its premiere. Among its admirers was his friend Marietta Shaginyan, who after the first performance made the sign of the cross over him and exclaimed: &quot;You must not say, Dmitri Dmitrievich, that you are not well. You &quot;are&quot; well, because you have made us happy!&quot; Tikhon Khrennikov praised the symphony as one of Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;most profound&quot;, adding that it was &quot;full of optimism [and] belief in man&#x27;s inexhaustible strength&quot;. The first movement drew especial praise from Norman Kay in England, who called it a &quot;tour-de-force of concentration, self-dissolution, and musical economy&quot;. Eric Roseberry noted that the symphony&#x27;s instrumental timbres and use of passacaglia suggested that Shostakovich had been influenced by the late operas of his friend, Benjamin Britten. Yevgeny Mravinsky, who led the symphony&#x27;s Leningrad premiere, found himself &quot;overwhelmed&quot; during his study of the score, telling his wife he would continue to return to this &quot;autobiographical&quot; symphony until the 
&quot;end of his days&quot;.

Shostakovich&#x27;s use of quotations and allusions to various works by himself and other composers has attracted speculation since its premiere. He initially described the first movement as &quot;childhood, just a toyshop under a cloudless sky&quot;; later, he cautioned listeners against taking &quot;this definition too precisely&quot;. When describing the music and the process of the symphony&#x27;s composition, Shostakovich said that he still felt music the way he did as a child. While he maintained that he was unable to explain his extended use of musical quotation, he also said that he &quot;could &quot;not&quot;, could &quot;not&quot;, &quot;not&quot; include them&quot;. He reported to Glikman and Krzysztof Meyer that he made use of &quot;exact quotations&quot; from Beethoven, as well as Rossini and Wagner, and that he had been under the influence of Mahler&#x27;s music while he composed the symphony. According to Maxim Shostakovich, he had been urged by his father not to reveal to the orchestra at the first rehearsal that there would be a quotation from Rossini in the first movement: &quot;I want to see their faces when they come to it&quot;.

Maxim Shostakovich expressed the opinion that to him the symphony reflected &quot;the great philosophical problems of a man&#x27;s life cycle&quot;. Later he likened the work to a &quot;chamber symphony&quot; which described human life through the &quot;prison of existence&quot;. Another conductor, Kurt Sanderling, heard the music as being about loneliness and death, and that no other work by Shostakovich seemed to him so &quot;radically horrible and cruel&quot;. Alfred Schnittke, whose own music was deeply influenced by Shostakovich, held that the Fifteenth was a &quot;crossroads in time&quot; where &quot;the past enters into new relationships with the present, and, like the ghost of
Hamlet’s father, intrudes into the reality of the music and actually forms it&quot;. To Alexander Ivashkin, Shostakovich&#x27;s then unusual use of quotation signaled an awareness of the impossibility of composing a &quot;pure&quot; symphony, with the quotations creating a web of their own correspondences atop the &quot;traditional skeleton of the symphony&quot;.Shostakovich&#x27;s Fifteenth Symphony has also exerted influence beyond music. Director David Lynch cited it as an important influence on his 1986 film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;: &quot;I wrote the script to Shostakovich: No. 15 in A major. I just kept playing the same part of it, over and over again&quot;. During its filming, Lynch placed speakers on set and played the symphony in order to convey the mood he wanted. He later requested that Angelo Badalamenti compose a score for the film that was &quot;like Shostakovich&quot;.

<doc id="617769" wikidata="Q1818004" url="?curid=617769" title="Spiral (1998 film)">
<text>is a 1998 Japanese supernatural horror film and a sequel to &quot;Ring&quot; (1998). It is directed by Jōji Iida and is based on the novel of the same title by Koji Suzuki. It is titled The Spiral (stylized as the Spiral) in English on the Japanese poster and video packaging, and it was previously released in North America as Rasen (a transliteration of the Japanese title) and in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the Philippines as The Spiral.

&quot;Ring&quot; and its sequel &quot;Spiral&quot; were released in Japan at the same time. The studio hoped this would increase revenues, because the &quot;Ring&quot; story was already a successful novel and television film. The two films shared a few cast members and had the same production team, but different directors and screenwriters; &quot;Spiral&quot; was written and directed by Jōji Iida whereas &quot;Ring&quot; was written by Hiroshi Takahashi and directed by Hideo Nakata. After their release, &quot;Ring&quot; became an enormous success while &quot;Spiral&quot; floundered, quickly becoming the &quot;forgotten sequel&quot;.

Takahashi and Nakata were later recruited to produce another sequel, &quot;Ring 2&quot; (1999), which replaced &quot;Spiral&quot; as the sequel to &quot;Ring&quot;, not based on Suzuki&#x27;s works, and thus ultimately ignores the story of &quot;Spiral&quot;.

==Plot==
Following the events of &quot;Ring&quot;, the body of Ryūji Takayama, former husband of Reiko Asakawa and father of Yōichi Asakawa is examined by his friend and rival, pathologist Mitsuo Andō. After he finds a cryptic note in Takayama&#x27;s stomach, Reiko and Yōichi also turn up dead. Andō soon learns of a mysterious cursed videotape, haunted by the spirit of a murdered young woman. Rumor has it that anyone who watches the video will die exactly one week later. Despondent over the death of his own child, and believing that he is being guided by his rival&#x27;s ghost, Andō decides to see the video for himself. After watching the tape, strange things begin to happen around him, and he soon discovers that the tape&#x27;s restless spirit has different plans in store for him.

With the help of Takayama&#x27;s student, Mai Takano, Andō discovers more about Ryūji&#x27;s past and the mysterious young woman, Sadako Yamamura. Searching for the truth about why Ryūji and Yōichi died from the virus while Reiko did not lead him to her boss, Yoshino. Yoshino lets Andō in on a secret: he has Reiko&#x27;s diary. She and Ryūji had been researching the cursed videotape. While Reiko had broken the curse, Ryūji died 1 week after watching the tape. Reiko believed creating a copy would break the curse, but Yōichi died 1 week after watching the tape, just like his father had. Yoshino shows Andō both the tape and the diary.

When Andō tells Mai Takano what he has done, she is shocked and cannot understand why, since she felt from the start that it was the video that killed Takayama and his family. As they are talking, Yoshino calls Andō. He admits that he wishes he had never been involved in Reiko&#x27;s business. Andō believes that Yoshino had watched the video but denies it, saying he was too scared. However, Yoshino still dies.

Andō destroys the videotapes and ensures he will be the video&#x27;s last victim. He then confides in Mai about his son&#x27;s death, and they end up sleeping together. Andō asks Mai if she will be there when he dies, but Mai tells him she is too scared. He understands and decides to try to find out more about the virus that killed Takayama and his son. He discovers that the virus that killed Yoshino is different from the one that killed the father and son. Andō asks for tests to be run on him.

Meanwhile, Mai Takano goes missing, and Andō apparently survives the curse. He starts to feel that the story was just a myth and he is relieved when Mai turns up, but is shocked to find out that she has been found dead, having given birth with no sign of a baby. Andō goes back to work, sees &quot;Mai&quot; there, and finds out that she is no other than Sadako Yamamura, reborn and claiming to be &quot;perfectly dual-gendered&quot;. He then learns that Takayama was not helping Andō &quot;stop&quot; Sadako – instead, he was &quot;helping&quot; Sadako. Yoshino, Andō&#x27;s friend Miyashita, and many others were not killed by a virus or the video, but rather Reiko&#x27;s diary. Sadako promises to help resurrect Andō&#x27;s son in exchange for his help.

In the end, Andō brings Takayama and his son back to life with help from Sadako. Just as Ryūji leaves, he tells Andō: &quot;Many years will pass before our world will be at peace&quot;.

==Cast==
* Kōichi Satō as Mitsuo Andō
* Miki Nakatani as Mai Takano
* Hinako Saeki as Sadako Yamamura
* Shingo Tsurumi as Miyashita
* Shigemitsu Ogi as Maekawa Keibuho
* Yutaka Matsushige as Yoshino
* Daisuke Ban as Heihachiro Ikuma
* Naoaki Manabe as Kobayashi
* Hiroyuki Sanada as Ryūji Takayama

==Release==
&quot;Spiral&quot; was released theatrically in Japan on January 31, 1998 where it was distributed by Toho. In the Philippines, the film was given a limited release as &quot;The Spiral&quot; on February 25, 2004.

The film was released directly to DVD by DreamWorks in the United States on August 23, 2005, under the transliterated title &quot;Rasen&quot;.

It was released in high definition on Blu-ray Disc and video on demand in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland by Arrow Films under their Arrow Video imprint, under the title &quot;Spiral&quot;. &quot;Spiral&quot; was also included in Arrow Video&#x27;s &quot;Ring Collection&quot; Blu-ray box set.

==Reception==
&quot;Den of Geek&quot; called the film &quot;neither as poor as its reputation suggests or a long lost gem&quot;, while &quot;Collider&quot; called it a &quot;gonzo sequel, one that doesn&#x27;t hold itself together as well as its predecessor, it is a movie that should not be forgotten&quot;.

==Legacy==
Though this film was replaced by &quot;Ring 2&quot; as the sequel to &quot;Ring&quot;, it was followed by a related installment 14 years later in &quot;Sadako 3D&quot; (2012), a loose adaptation of the Suzuki novel &quot;S&quot;, the fourth installment in the Ring series. &quot;S&quot; is canonically a sequel to the novel &quot;Spiral&quot; that this film is an adaptation of. That being said, the film has little coherent continuity with &quot;Rasen&quot; (or any of the other Ringu films) outside of Takanori Ando, the protagonist of &quot;Sadako 3D&quot;, being the son of Mitsuo Ando, the protagonist of this film and the novel. That&#x27;s partially because Suzuki&#x27;s third novel, 1998&#x27;s Loop, was never adapted into a film, leaving a huge gap of story in between these films.

<doc id="617777" wikidata="Q903233" url="?curid=617777" title="Electron deficiency">
<text>In chemistry, electron deficiency (and electron-deficient) is jargon that is used in two contexts: chemical species that violate the octet rule because they have too few valence electrons and species that happen to follow the octet rule but have electron-acceptor properties, forming donor-acceptor charge-transfer salts.

==Octet rule violations==
Traditionally, &quot;electron-deficiency&quot; is used as a general descriptor for boron hydrides and other molecules which do not have enough valence electrons to form localized (2-centre 2-electron) bonds joining all atoms. For example, diborane (B2H6) would require a minimum of 7 localized bonds with 14 electrons to join all 8 atoms, but there are only 12 valence electrons. A similar situation exists in trimethylaluminium. The electron deficiency in such compounds is similar to metallic bonding.

==Electron-acceptor molecules==

Alternatively, electron-deficiency describes molecules or ions that function as electron acceptors. Such electron-deficient species obey the octet rule, but they have (usually mild) oxidizing properties. 1,3,5-Trinitrobenzene and related polynitrated aromatic compounds are often described as electron-deficient. Electron deficiency can be measured by linear free-energy relationships: &quot;a strongly negative ρ value indicates a large electron demand at the reaction center, from which it may be concluded that a highly electron-deficient center, perhaps an incipient carbocation, is involved.&quot;

<text>Ludovic Halévy (1 January 1834 – 7 May 1908) was a French author and playwright, best known for his collaborations with Henri Meilhac on Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; and on the works of Jacques Offenbach.

==Biography==
Ludovic Halévy was born in Paris. His father, Léon Halévy (1802–1883), was a civil servant and a clever and versatile writer, who tried almost every branch of literature—prose and verse, vaudeville, drama, history—without, however, achieving decisive success in any. His uncle, Fromental Halévy, was a noted composer of opera; hence the double and early connection of Ludovic Halévy with the Parisian stage. His father had converted from Judaism to Christianity prior to his marriage with Alexandrine Lebas, daughter of a Christian architect.

At the age of six, Halévy might have been seen playing in that &quot;Foyer de la danse&quot; with which he was to make his readers so familiar, and, when a boy of twelve, he would often, on a Sunday night, on his way back to the Collège Louis le Grand, look in at the Odéon, where he had free admittance, and see the first act of the new play. At eighteen he joined the ranks of the French administration and occupied various posts, the last being that of &quot;secrétaire-rédacteur&quot; to the Corps Législatif. In that capacity, he enjoyed the special favour and friendship of the famous duke of Morny, then president of that assembly.
In 1865, Ludovic Halévy&#x27;s increasing popularity as an author enabled him to retire from the public service. Ten years earlier, he had become acquainted with the musician Offenbach, who was about to start a small theatre of his own in the Champs-Élysées, and he wrote a sort of prologue, &quot;Entrez, messieurs, mesdames&quot;, for the opening night. Other little productions followed, &quot;Ba-ta-clan&quot; being the most noticeable among them. They were produced under the pseudonym of Jules Servières. The name of Ludovic Halévy appeared for the first time on the bills on 1 January 1856. Soon afterwards, the unprecedented run of &quot;Orphée aux enfers&quot;, a musical parody, written in collaboration with Hector Crémieux, made his name famous. In the spring of 1860, he was commissioned to write a play for the manager of the Variétés in conjunction with another vaudevillist, Lambert-Thiboust.

The latter having abruptly retired from the collaboration, Halévy was at a loss how to carry out the contract, when on the steps of the theatre he met Henri Meilhac (1831–1897), then comparatively a stranger to him. He proposed to Meilhac the task rejected by Lambert Thiboust, and the proposal was immediately accepted. Thus began a connection which was to last over twenty years, and which proved most fruitful both for the reputation of the two authors and the prosperity of the minor Paris theatres. Their joint works may be divided into three classes: the operettas, the farces, the comedies. The &quot;opérettes&quot; afforded excellent opportunities to a gifted musician for the display of his peculiar humour. They were broad and lively libels against the society of the time, but savoured strongly of the vices and follies they were supposed to satirize. Amongst the most celebrated works of the joint authors were &quot;La belle Hélène&quot; (1864), &quot;Barbe-bleue&quot; (1866), &quot;La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein&quot; (1867), &quot;La Périchole&quot; (1868), and &quot;Le Réveillon&quot;, which became one of the sources of Johann Strauss&#x27;s operetta Die Fledermaus.

After 1870, the vogue of parody rapidly declined. The decadence became still more apparent when Offenbach was no longer at hand to assist the two authors with his quaint musical irony, and when they had to deal with interpreters almost destitute of singing powers. They wrote farces of the old type, consisting of complicated intrigues, with which they cleverly interwove the representation of contemporary whims and social oddities. They generally failed when they attempted comedies of a more serious character and tried to introduce a higher sort of emotion. A solitary exception must be made in the case of &quot;Froufrou&quot; (1869), which, owing perhaps to the admirable talent of Aimée Desclée, remains their unique &quot;Succès de larmes&quot;. During this period, they wrote the libretto to &quot;Carmen&quot; but it was a sideshow to their other work.
Meilhac and Halévy will be found at their best in light sketches of Parisian life, &quot;Les Sonnettes&quot;, &quot;Madame attend Monsieur&quot;, &quot;Toto chez Tata&quot; and &quot;Le Roi Candaule&quot; (the title of the last is derived from the Classical Greek account of the semi-legendary King Candaules). In that intimate association between the two men who had met so opportunely on the &quot;perron des variétés&quot;, it was often asked who was the leading partner. The question was not answered until the connection was finally severed and they stood before the public, each to answer for his own work. It was then apparent that they had many gifts in common. Both had wit, humour, observation of character. Meilhac had a ready imagination, a rich and whimsical fancy; Halévy had taste, refinement and pathos of a certain kind. Not less clever than his brilliant comrade, he was more human.

Of this he gave evidence in two delightful books, &quot;Monsieur et Madame Cardinal&quot; (1873) and &quot;Les Petites Cardinal&quot;, in which the lowest orders of the Parisian middle class are faithfully described. The pompous, pedantic, venomous &quot;Monsieur Cardinal&quot; will long survive as the true image of sententious and self-glorifying immorality. M. Halévy&#x27;s peculiar qualities are even more visible in the simple and striking scenes of the Invasion, published soon after the conclusion of the Franco-German War, in &quot;Criquette&quot; (1883) and &quot;The Abbot Constantine&quot; (1882), two novels, the latter of which went through innumerable editions. Émile Zola had presented to the public an almost exclusive combination of bad men and women; in &quot;L&#x27;Abbé Constantin&quot; all are kind and good, and the change was eagerly welcomed by the public. Some enthusiasts robustly maintain that the Abbé will rank permanently in literature by the side of the equally chimerical &quot;Vicar of Wakefield&quot;. At any rate, it opened for M. Ludovic Halévy the doors of the Académie française, to which he was elected in 1884.

Halévy remained an assiduous frequenter of the Academy, the Conservatoire, the Comédie Française, and the Society of Dramatic Authors, but, when he died in Paris on 7 May 1908, he had produced practically nothing new for many years.

His last romance, &quot;Kari Kari&quot;, appeared in 1892. His diary was published in book form in 1935 as well as serially in the pages of the &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot; in 1937–38.

<doc id="617794" wikidata="Q5138418" url="?curid=617794" title="Coat of arms of Birmingham">
<text>The coat of arms of Birmingham – the heraldic emblem of the English city of Birmingham – was first used in 1838 and has changed several times since, as the former town grew and developed into a city.

==History==
===Incorporation===
Following the incorporation of Birmingham as a borough in 1838, the corporation approved the design of a seal comprising &quot;The Birmingham Arms, encircled with a wreath&quot;, with the motto &quot;Forward&quot;. The arms were those used from about 1413 to 1536 by the de Bermingham family, holders of the manor.

The quartered shield featured in the first and fourth quarters five gold lozenges or diamond shapes conjoined in a diagonal bend. These were the original arms of the de Berminghams until about 1343. The second and third quarters were divided vertically with an indented line. This should have been coloured in sable and argent (black and white), but in the version adopted by the corporation it was coloured or and gules (gold and red). These were in fact the arms of another branch of the family, who became the Barons of Athenry and Earls of Louth in Ireland. In 1867 a new seal was made, and at the time the discrepancy in the colouring of the second and third quarters was noticed. However, it was decided to retain the colouring.

===City status===
In 1889 Birmingham was granted city status, and to celebrate this fact, the corporation applied to the College of Arms for a grant of supporters to the arms. It was then realised that the arms used by Birmingham had never been officially granted, so a full grant of arms, crest and supporters was obtained in April of that year.

The shield was altered, with the addition of an ermine fess or horizontal band across the centre. This comes from the arms of the Calthorpe family, lords of the manor of Edgbaston, an area included in the borough at its incorporation. A mural crown – resembling a city wall – was placed on the fess to represent local government. The crest consisted of a man&#x27;s arm holding a hammer, symbolising industry. The supporters were two human figures: a male figure (dressed as a blacksmith) representing industry and a female figure (holding a book and painter&#x27;s palette) representing art.

===Modernisation===
By 1930 the city corporation felt that the design looked too old fashioned and adopted a new depiction designed by the Birmingham School of Art.

As there were doubts about the heraldic correctness of the new design, a new painting was obtained from the College of Arms in 1936 incorporating the changes, but still conforming to the 1889 blazon or technical description. The main changes were the addition of a helm and mantling between the shield and crest, a redrawing of the male figure and the replacement of the platform on which the supporters stood with a grassy compartment.

These arms continued in use until the abolition of the corporation.

==Current==
A new City of Birmingham was created, including the old city and the former borough of Sutton Coldfield, in 1974. New arms were granted to Birmingham City Council in 1977, closely based on the old arms. The ermine fess was changed to a cross, charged with a bishop&#x27;s mitre. These come from the Sutton Coldfield corporation arms and commemorate Bishop Vesey of Exeter, a native of Sutton, who was largely responsible for the growth of the town in the 16th century. A Tudor rose was added to the 1889 crest. This was the device of Sutton Coldfield from at least 1619 until 1935. As the College of Arms does not allow two bodies or persons to have identical supporters, they were swapped to opposite sides of the shield. The male figure now holds a cupel, a tool used in the manufacture of jewellery, an important industry in modern Birmingham.

== Use ==
As well as its use on seals and letters, the coat of arms is used in a number of ways, for example as an architectural detail, or to decorate items including buses (in the days when municipal transport was the responsibility of the council), street furniture, refuse collection vehicles, and even the crockery and cutlery used in the Council House. The coat of arms are on street signs across the city. They are situated on the left side of the street sign, with the postcode area on the right side.

The council flag is a banner of the arms and flies daily from public buildings within the city, including the Council House and the Town Hall in Victoria Square.

<text>A super cup is a competition, in association football, basketball, handball, volleyball and rugby union which often forms the &#x27;curtain raiser&#x27; to a season, and typically involves only two teams who have qualified through success in other competitions during the previous season. 

It is typically contested on a national level by two competition winners of the previous season: the national knock-out cup winner and the highest level league champion. There are also continental super cups, like the UEFA Super Cup in football, which puts together winners of the top and second-tier UEFA competitions and the Recopa Sudamericana between CONMEBOL Libertadores and the Sudamericana winners, and cross-border super cups between champions of neighbouring leagues, such as the Campeones Cup between the winners of the highest level leagues in the United States and Mexico, and the Champions Cup for the champions of both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. 

The now-defunct Intercontinental Cup was a super cup played between the continental champions of Europe and South America, with winners retroactively recognised by world governing body FIFA as World Champions prior to the creation of the official FIFA Club World Cup and the CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions between the winners of the European Football Championship and the Copa América, which rebranded once again in 2022 after the 29-year hiatus.

Sometimes, these are two-legged ties, with a match played at each side&#x27;s stadium, but increasingly they are one-off fixtures at a neutral venue, such as a national stadium. Some Super Cups have even been staged in venues outside their home country, such as the Italian, French, Spanish, Turkish, Mexican, and Egyptian games and increasingly function as publicity events for that league in the global market. 

If the league champions are also the national cup winners, they may play a selected XI team, or more commonly the runners-up from one of the competitions, typically from the league.

The Finalissima between the national team continental champions of UEFA and CONMEBOL, also known as the CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions, plus its women&#x27;s counterpart, are rare examples of &#x27;super cups&#x27; between national sides.

===Continental super cups===
Some continental football federations also have their own super cups:

* CAF: CAF Super Cup
* CONMEBOL: Recopa Sudamericana
* UEFA: UEFA Super Cup

===Regional super cups===
* UAFA: Arab Super Cup (defunct)

===Intercontinental super cups===
Most of the continental football confederations have jointly held a competition pitting their champions against each other:

* CONMEBOL &amp; UEFA: Intercontinental Cup (defunct)
* CONCACAF &amp; CONMEBOL: Copa Interamericana (defunct)
* AFC &amp; CAF: Afro-Asian Club Championship (defunct)

All of these competitions are now defunct and have been succeeded by the FIFA Club World Cup and the FIFA Intercontinental Cup, which features the champions of all of the confederations. In 2017, FIFA retroactively recognised the winners of the European/South American Cup as world champions.

A similar tournament was held at international level, the FIFA Confederations Cup. It was initially held on a biennial basis, every odd year, from 1993 until 2005 when it became quadrennial, the year before a World Cup in its host country. It featured the six continental champions, the World Cup winners and the host. The 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup was the 10th and last Confederations Cup before FIFA abolished it for an expanded Club World Cup. CONMEBOL and UEFA relaunched the CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions in 2020, previously held as the European/South American Nations Cup in 1985 and 1993, to be contested between the champions of both confederations. The rebooted cup, now branded as the Finalissima, held its first edition in 2022, with quadrennial editions to follow. The two confederations launched a Women&#x27;s Finalissima in 2023, involving the most recent winners of the Copa América Femenina and Women&#x27;s Euro. It is also planned to be a quadrennial event.

Other tournaments like this have been held, including the Intercontinental Champions&#x27; Supercup (contested by the past winners of the Intercontinental Cup), the Club Challenge, previously held as Supercopa Euroamericana (pitting the Copa Sudamericana and UEFA Europa League winners), the J.League-Sudamericana Championship (pitting the Copa Sudamericana and J.League Cup winners), the Copa de Oro (pitting all the most recent CONMEBOL competition winners), and the Copa Iberoamericana (pitting the Copa de Oro and Copa del Rey winners).

<text>Holyrood Park (also called the King&#x27;s Park or Queen&#x27;s Park depending on the reigning monarch&#x27;s gender) is a royal park in central Edinburgh, Scotland about to the east of Edinburgh Castle. It is open to the public. It has an array of hills, lochs, glens, ridges, basalt cliffs, and patches of gorse, providing a wild piece of highland landscape within its area. The park is associated with the Palace of Holyroodhouse and was formerly a royal hunting estate. The park was created in 1541 when James V had the ground &quot;circulit about Arthurs Sett, Salisborie and Duddingston craggis&quot; enclosed by a stone wall.
Arthur&#x27;s Seat, an extinct volcano and the highest point in Edinburgh, is at the centre of the park, with the cliffs of Salisbury Crags to the west. There are three lochs: St Margaret&#x27;s Loch, Dunsapie Loch, and Duddingston Loch. The ruins of St Anthony&#x27;s Chapel stand above St Margaret&#x27;s Loch. Queen&#x27;s Drive is the main route through the Park. St Margaret&#x27;s Well and St Anthony&#x27;s Well are both natural springs within the park. Holyrood Park is located to the south-east of the Old Town, at the edge of the city centre. Abbeyhill is to the north, and Duddingston village to the east. The University of Edinburgh&#x27;s Pollock Halls of Residence are to the south-west, and Dumbiedykes is to the west.

The whole of Holyrood Park was made a Scheduled Monument in 2013. It is owned, apart from the roadways which are retained by the Crown, by Scottish Ministers the whole being managed by Historic Environment Scotland. Various archaeological survey has taken place across the site, though findings are not yet fully understood.

==Natural features==

===Arthur&#x27;s Seat===

Arthur&#x27;s Seat is the main peak of the group of hills which form most of Holyrood Park. The hill rises above the city to a height of , provides excellent views, is quite easy to climb, and is a popular walk. Though it can be climbed from almost any direction, the easiest and simplest ascent is from the east, where a grassy slope rises above Dunsapie Loch, a small artificial loch located between Dunsapie Hill and Arthur&#x27;s Seat and which is a popular location within the park, supporting several bird species.

=== Salisbury Crags ===

Salisbury Crags are a series of cliffs at the top of a subsidiary spur of Arthur&#x27;s Seat which rise on the west of Holyrood Park. Below the foot of the cliffs is a large and steep talus slope falling to the floor of Holyrood Park, with a track running in the space between the two. This track was given the name Radical Road after it was paved in the aftermath of the Radical War of 1820 to provide jobs for unemployed radical weavers from the west of Scotland, at the suggestion of Walter Scott.

Creation of the Radical Road gave easy access to the upper rockface, and infamously the official Keeper of the Royal Park, Charles Hamilton, 8th Earl of Haddington, abused his position to start quarrying the rock face around 1821, causing damage that is still visible. The track was closed in 2018 after a large rock fall. A report suggested various possibilities: a sky walkway, reopening the path at users&#x27; risk, installing shelters or wire mesh, or permanent closure.

Hugo Arnot suggested in the 18th century that the name Salisbury Crags derives from the first Earl of Salisbury, who accompanied Edward III of England on one of his invasions of Scotland. James Grant&#x27;s view of this in 1880 is that it was &quot;an idle story&quot;, and quoted Lord Hailes&#x27; derivation from Anglo-Saxon meaning &quot;waste or dry habitation&quot;. The modern Gaelic name of the cliffs is Creagan Salisbury, a direct translation of the English; however in 1128, the cliffs were described in a charter under an older Gaelic name, Creag nam Marbh (the Crag of the Dead).

The cliffs are formed from steep dolerite and columnar basalt and have a long history of rock climbing on their faces starting from the earliest days of the sport. Harold Raeburn was brought up nearby, and became the leading climber of the Scottish Mountaineering Club not long after he joined it in 1896. By 1900 a number of traditional climbing and sport climbing routes had been recorded by Raeburn and W. Inglis Clark. In recent years the park rangers (previously under the auspices of the Royal Estate and now Historic Environment Scotland, who had taken over management of the park) attempted to regulate access to the cliffs due to hazards to park visitors from loose and falling rocks. Climbers are now restricted to a designated area of the South Quarry, and need to apply for a permit, free of charge, at the education centre in the north of the park in order to be allowed to climb. There is still some activity, though most of it is bouldering rather than free climbing. The finest areas are in the two quarries, although it is only in the South Quarry that climbing is still permitted at this time. The south quarry contains the Black Wall, a well-known bouldering testpiece in the Edinburgh climbing scene. The best known route to climb the Crags is at &quot;Cat Nick&quot; or &quot;Cat&#x27;s Nick&quot;, a cleft in the rocks near the highest point of the Crags. This is named on maps, sometimes leading people to believe that the highest point of the crag is so named.

===Samson&#x27;s Ribs===
Samson&#x27;s Ribs are a formation of columnar basalt.

===St Margaret&#x27;s Loch===

St Margaret&#x27;s Loch is a shallow man-made lochan to the south of Queen&#x27;s Drive. It is around 500 m east of the Palace of Holyroodhouse, and about 100 m north of the ruin of St Anthony&#x27;s Chapel. Once a boggy marshland, the loch was formed in 1856 as part of Prince Albert&#x27;s improvement plans for the area surrounding the palace. The loch has been used as a boating pond but is now home to a strong population of ducks, geese, and swans.

===Other geographical features===
Other geographical features include the Haggis Knowe, Whinny Hill and Hunter&#x27;s Bog, which drains into St Margaret&#x27;s Loch.

==Cultural heritage==
There are traces of four prehistoric hill forts within the park, at Arthur&#x27;s Seat, Salisbury Crags, Samson&#x27;s Ribs and Dunsapie Hill. The remains of cultivation terraces can be seen on the eastern slopes of Arthur&#x27;s Seat.

===Holyrood Abbey===

The ruined Augustinian Abbey of Holyrood was established in 1128, at the order of King David I of Scotland, within his royal deer-hunting park. The Abbey was in use until the 16th century. It was briefly used as a Chapel Royal by James VII, but was finally ruined in the mid-18th century.

===Palace of Holyroodhouse===

The Palace of Holyroodhouse began as a lodging within the Abbey, but eventually grew into a substantial palace. James IV had the first buildings constructed around 1500, although the bulk of the present building dates from the late 17th century, when it was remodelled in the neo-classical style by Sir William Bruce. It remains as the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland.

Both Mary, Queen of Scots, and her father James V kept sheep in some areas of the park, looked after by John Huntar. In May 1562 Dunsapie Loch was the setting for an entertainment at the wedding of John, Lord Fleming, and Elizabeth Ross, which involved a theatrical recreation of the siege of Leith. Mary had a place made for picnic suppers in the park. Sheep continued to be kept inside Holyrood park until 1975.

===St Anthony&#x27;s Chapel===
The origin and history of the chapel are obscure, but it was certainly built no later than the early 15th century, as in 1426 it is recorded that the Pope gave money for its repair. The chapel may have been linked to the Preceptory of St. Anthony, a skin hospice, which was based in Leith around this time. It may have been linked to the nearby Holyrood Abbey. James Grant says that the tradition was that the chapel was set up to protect a nearby holy spring (St Anthony&#x27;s Well). This apparently dried up completely in 1674 but after some decades it rematerialised at a lower point.

The chapel was originally rectangular in shape, around , with walls, and was built with local stone. The tower would have stood just over high, and probably had a spiral stair inside. The chapel is depicted on Richard Lee&#x27;s sketch plan of Edinburgh at the time of Lord Hertford&#x27;s raid on Edinburgh in 1544. The chapel deteriorated over the years and in 1779, Hugo Arnot in his &quot;The History of Edinburgh&quot; described it as &quot;a beautiful Gothick building, well suited to the rugged sublimity of the rock ... At its west end there was a tower .. about forty feet high.&quot; 

The chapel is now a ruin: only the north wall and a fragment of the west wall remain next to part of an ancillary building.

=== Muschat&#x27;s Cairn ===

This cairn is situated by the Duke&#x27;s Walk at the eastern (Meadowbank) end of Holyrood Park. It commemorates an event on 17 October 1720 when Nicol Muschat, an unemployed surgeon, cut his wife&#x27;s throat at this spot. He was tried and hanged on 6 January 1721 for this crime. At his trial he said that he had simply tired of her.

The present cairn consists of boulders cemented together and was erected in 1823 replacing an earlier cairn which had been removed c.1789. This earlier cairn was formed over several years by the tradition of laying stones on the cairn &quot;in token of the people&#x27;s abhorrence and reprobation of the deed&quot;. It was situated some way to the west of the present cairn with Sir Walter Scott placing it about a furlong to the east of St. Anthony&#x27;s Chapel. Scott mentions the cairn several times in the novel, The Heart of Midlothian, by siting Jeanie Dean&#x27;s tryst with the outlaw, George Robertson, at this spot. The site of the so-called Jeanie Deans Cottage can also be seen in Holyrood Park at the south end of St. Leonards Bank.

===St Margaret&#x27;s Well===

The medieval well house of St Margaret&#x27;s Well which was originally at Meadowbank, Restalrig was relocated just north of Salisbury Crags in 1860.

A plaque above the well informs:

&quot;This unique Well House dates from the late 15th Century. It originally stood at Restalrig, close to the Church, and its design is a miniature copy of St. Triduana&#x27;s Aisle there. In 1860 it was removed from its first site, which was then encroached upon by a railway depot, and was reconstructed in its present position near a natural spring.&quot;

===Royal Volunteer Review===
The most dramatic event in the park&#x27;s history took place on 7 August 1860 when an immense assembly was made of the several Scottish volunteer regiments to appear before Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The huge number of soldiers were billeted in schools, warehouses etc over the preceding days. These included the larger part of 250 regiments such as the Breadalbane Highlanders led by the aged John Campbell, 2nd Marquess of Breadalbane and Easdale Volunteers. All were under the overall command of Lt Gen George Wetherall.

The &quot;Artists Company&quot; included William McTaggart, John Pettie and Samuel Bough.

The fashion at the time was for ornamental arches along the route to be taken by the monarch, plus other temporary decorations. These were designed by a committee including David Octavius Hill, Joseph Noel Paton and W. B. Johnstone (Keeper of the Scottish National Gallery). Structures included a timber grandstand on the flat ground on the north edge of the park, capable of holding 3000 persons.

The volunteers stood in groups on three sides of the grandstand, mainly along the north edge of the road. Beyond the lower slopes of Arthur&#x27;s Seat created a natural amphitheatre from which the non-ticketed observers could gather. These were numbered as 100 to 300,000 which was considerably more than the total population of Edinburgh, but as many volunteers brought their families from up north, is not impossible.

Starting at 3pm Queen Victoria first drove by the 21,000 volunteers in an open carriage then sat on the &quot;saluting dais&quot; at the front of the grandstand. The Ross-shire Buffs provided the pipers for the ceremony. The soldiers then marched by the dais, saluting in waves as they were opposite the Queen. This took almost two hours. After readopting their original positions a unified general salute was made, followed by three cheers for the Queen. With the crowd then joining the cheer, the huge volume is said to have spooked multiple horses, upon which the various officers were mounted, and there was temporary confusion.

The parade officially ended at 6pm but the crowds did not fully disperse until sunset. Official thanks were conveyed to the regiments by Adjutant General James Yorke Scarlett.

A second major review took place in August 1881 with 44,000 parading under command of Gen Alastair Macdonald and a third in 1905.

== Road network ==
Up until 1844, no metalled road existed around the Park. The road network in the park today is a product of Prince Albert&#x27;s reforms in 1844, which added the circular Victoria Road, later called The Queen&#x27;s Drive.

The roads in Holyrood Park are not part of the City of Edinburgh road network. Holyrood Park, is under the ownership and care of the Scottish Ministers and managed through Historic Environment Scotland (HES) as a Property in Care. HES receives no direct funding for the upkeep of the park roads.

=== Road closures ===
HES has the authority to close most roads to motor vehicles when required or requested. HES may open or close roads at any time in the interest of safety or maintenance, or to facilitate organised events.

All roads in the park are closed to vehicles every Saturday and Sunday, with varying summer and winter hours and access to Broad Pavement, Duddingston, and Meadowbank car parks maintained. The road network is also closed for many events and holidays during the year: Christmas, Boxing Day, New Years Day, Edinburgh Marathon, marches etc. 

To help close the roads, there are gates at the five motor vehicle entrances: Dukes Walk (north east), Holyrood Gait (north west), Horse Wynd (north west), Holyrood Park Road (south west) and Old Church Lane (south east).

During the COVID-19 lockdowns, the High Road was closed to motor vehicles at all times. This was at first due to the annual toad migration in March and early April, but HES continued the road closure after the toad migration ended. The High Road is now closed to motor vehicles except daytime on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays and for the annual toad migration. 

=== Regulations ===
As a Royal Park, Holyrood Park is protected under the framework of The Parks Regulations Acts, 1872 to 1974, The Holyrood Park Regulations 1971 and subsequent amendments.

The Holyrood Park Regulations 1971 prohibit:

* soliciting passengers with a hackney carriage;
* driving or using any vehicle designed to seat more than seven passengers (in addition to the driver), or constructed or adapted for the purpose of any trade or business or as a dwelling; effectively prohibiting commercial vehicles.

The Holyrood Park Amendment Regulations 2005 instituted parking charges at Broad Pavement car park.

Coaches require the written permission of the Scottish Ministers to use Holyrood Park. Coach drivers must obtain a permit which is valid for 12 calendar months. Coach Permits are only valid while coaches are carrying passengers. Empty coaches travelling through the Park are classed as commercial vehicles and liable to a fixed penalty notice. Permits only allow coaches access to The Queen&#x27;s Drive and High Road and do not allow access to the Low Road between Holyrood Park Road (Commonwealth Pool) and Old Church Lane (Duddingston Village).

=== Traffic reduction ===
In 2011, Historic Scotland started a campaign to reduce traffic passing through Holyrood Park. Martin Gray, Historic Scotland&#x27;s Royal Parks Visitor Services Manager, noted increasing motor traffic in the park: &quot;Holyrood Park is a unique green space in the heart of the city. The Park&#x27;s location makes it very accessible and popular to visitors, but developments around the park have resulted in increasing levels of through-traffic, commercial vehicle misuse and speeding. Large and heavy vehicles cause accelerated wearing of roads surfaces and damage kerbs and traffic islands. They also pose a risk to park users and wildlife who enjoy the use of the Park.&quot;

=== Cycling infrastructure ===
There is a cycle path on the south side of Queen&#x27;s Drive from St Margaret&#x27;s Loch to Broad Pavement car park, but the path is shared between pedestrians and cyclists between Broad Pavement car park and the roundabout by the Royal Commonwealth Pool entrance to the park.

<text>Miroljub Labus (Serbian Cyrillic: Мирољуб Лабус; born 28 February 1947) is a Serbian economist and former politician. He is currently a University of Belgrade professor, lecturing political economy at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law. He is also the owner of consulting firm Belox Advisory Service.

Labus was the Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia from March 2004, serving under PM Vojislav Koštunica. He resigned on May 3, 2006, after EU suspended enlargement talks with Serbia over Ratko Mladić. Labus also resigned from the position of President of G17 Plus.

==Early life and education==
Labus was born in Mala Krsna, near Smederevo, PR Serbia, FPR Yugoslavia. He graduated from law school in 1970 from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law. This was followed by two postgraduate qualifications in economics.

==Academic and administrative career==
Labus began his career in academia as a university professor. In 1983, he was a Fulbright fellow at Cornell University.

Labus was a senior adviser at the Federal Statistics Bureau (Savezni zavod za statistiku) in Belgrade between 1986 and 1994. Since 1993, he has been a researcher at Belgrade&#x27;s Economics Institute. He edited the Federal Bureau of Statistics&#x27;s &quot;Economic Trend&quot; publication from 1990 to 1996, and the Belgrade Economics Institute&#x27;s &quot;Economic Barometer&quot; from 1994 to 2000. Labus has also been involved with the National Bank of Yugoslavia and World Bank. 

==Political career==
Already politically involved as a macroeconomic policy adviser to SFR Yugoslavia&#x27;s federal government, he joined the recently established Democratic Party (DS) in 1990.

===Democratic Party===
In 1992, Labus was elected as MP to the FR Yugoslavia&#x27;s federal parliament. While in this role, he was also a member of the parliamentary Monetary Policy Committee. In 1994, he was promoted to Vice-President of the Democratic Party under Zoran Đinđić. He held this position until 1997.

===G17 Plus===
In 1999, Labus became President of the Administrative Board of the G17 Plus movement. At this time, the G17 Plus movement was a lobby group focused on encouraging economic reforms within Serbia. G17 Plus soon become powerful, with significant public support. In 2000, he left the board of G17 Plus, taking up a position as Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia and Minister for International Economic Relations (in the federal government following the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević).

Leading up to the 2002 Serbian presidential elections, it was apparent that the current Serbian Prime Minister, Zoran Đinđić, did not have the appeal to match Koštunica, another candidate. Đinđić agreed to back Koštunica&#x27;s former ally, Labus, as an alternative candidate. In the resulting election, Koštunica defeated Labus. However, the election did not gain the required 50% voter turnout and the results were declared void. Labus continued on in his position for another year.

Labus continued working with G17 Plus and, in late 2002, he began transforming the lobby group into a full-fledged centrist political party, becoming its President. After the elections of December 2003, Labus and his party formed a minority coalition with the Democratic Party of Serbia and several other minor parties, in order to keep ultra-nationalist Tomislav Nikolić out of power. As a result, he retained his current positions. In 2006, Labus resigned from the position of President of G17 Plus party.

<doc id="617807" wikidata="Q220227" url="?curid=617807" title="Mamadou Tandja">
<text>Mamadou Tandja (1938 – 24 November 2020) was a Nigerien politician who was President of Niger from 1999 to 2010. He was President of the National Movement for the Development of Society (MNSD) from 1991 to 1999 and unsuccessfully ran as the MNSD&#x27;s presidential candidate in 1993 and 1996 before being elected to his first term in 1999. While serving as President of Niger, he was also Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States from 2005 to 2007.

Tandja was of mixed Fula and Soninke ethnicity. He was the first President of Niger who was not ethnically Hausa or Djerma.

Following a constitutional crisis in 2009, which was caused by Tandja&#x27;s efforts to remain in office beyond his term, he was ousted by the military in a coup d&#x27;état on 18 February 2010.

==Early life, 1974 coup, the Kountché regime and the MNSD==
Tandja was born in Maïné-Soroa, French West Africa in 1938, in the south-eastern part of what is now Niger. After joining the Nigerien army and rising to the rank of colonel, he participated in the 1974 coup that brought Seyni Kountché to power and became a member of the Supreme Military Council. He became Prefect of Maradi in 1976 before being appointed to the government as Minister of the Interior on 10 September 1979; he remained in the latter position until being replaced by Kountché himself on 31 August 1981. He was then Prefect of Tahoua from 1981 to March 1988, Ambassador to Nigeria from June 1988 to March 1990 and Minister of the Interior again from March 1990 to March 1991.

In 1991, Tandja emerged as the head of one of two powerful factions in the ruling National Movement of the Development Society (&quot;Mouvement National pour la Societé de Développement&quot;, MNSD) and at a party congress held in November 1991, he was elected as MNSD President. Tandja&#x27;s obtaining of the party leadership over rival faction leader Moumouni Adamou Djermakoye marked a departure from the traditional dominance of the party by Djermakoye&#x27;s Zarma (Djerma) ethnic group.

==1993 election and subsequent events==
Tandja ran for President in the elections of 1993, taking first place in the first round in February with 34.22% of the vote, but then losing to Mahamane Ousmane in the second round in March, taking 45.58% of the vote. Tandja accepted the results and congratulated Ousmane.

Tandja participated in an opposition protest against the government of the Alliance of the Forces of Change ruling coalition on 16 April 1994 and was arrested along with 90 others. Ousmane was overthrown in a military coup led by Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara on 27 January 1996.

==1996 election==
Under Maïnassara, a new presidential election was held on 7–8 July 1996, in which Tandja ran again; this time he took third place with 15.65% of the vote, behind Maïnassara with about 52% and Ousmane with about 20%, according to official results. On the second day of polling he was placed under house arrest along with the other three opposition candidates and held for two weeks. Following a pro-democracy demonstration on 11 January 1997, Tandja was arrested along with Ousmane and former Prime Minister Mahamadou Issoufou and held until 23 January.

==1999 election and first term==

In April 1999, Maïnassara was assassinated and a new military government led by Major Daouda Malam Wanké took over. This junta promised a return to democracy within the year, and the elections were held in October and November. Tandja won the presidential election, receiving first place, with 32% of the vote, in the first round, and 59.89% in the second round, defeating Issoufou. Tandja received the backing of Ousmane in the second round. The MNSD also won the most seats in the parliamentary election in November 1999 and Tandja himself was elected to the National Assembly as an MNSD candidate from Diffa constituency, although due to his concurrent election as President his seat was filled by his substitute, Nassourou Samaila. He took office as President on 22 December 1999. He appointed Hama Amadou as Prime Minister in January 2000.

Niger was heavily in debt and was not receiving any foreign aid due to the 1996 coup and subsequent suspension of democratic institutions. Tandja focused on economic development, negotiating with the civil service unions and with foreign donors. Many did not approve of Tandja&#x27;s measures in reducing government spending. In 2001, students at the University of Niamey staged violent protests against the reduction of their government grants. On 31 July 2002, some soldiers in Diffa started a mutiny demanding pay and improved living conditions; this briefly spread to Niamey a few days later. Loyalists defeated the mutineers and restored peace by 9 August, but Tandja came under political fire for his decrees blocking communication about the rebellion.

==2004 election and second term==
Tandja was a candidate for re-election in the 2004 presidential election. In the first round of the election, held on 16 November, he took first place with 40.7% of the vote, the rest being divided between five opponents. As in 1999, Mahamadou Issoufou took second place, and he participated in a runoff with Tandja on 4 December. Tandja was re-elected in the second round with 65.53% of the vote, with Issoufou receiving the remaining 34.47%. All four of the defeated first round candidates supported Tandja in the second round. He was sworn in for his second term on 21 December at a ceremony at the Général Seyni Kountché Stadium in Niamey, which was attended by six other African presidents.

Although there had been speculation about a possible constitutional change to enable Tandja to run again in 2009, he said in an interview with &quot;Le Monde&quot;, published on 6 October 2007, that he intended to step down at the end of his second term. However, on 21 December 2008, a large rally was held in front of the National Assembly building in Niamey calling for an extension of Tandja&#x27;s term by three years, so that it would end on 22 December 2012. According to supporters of this proposal—which also called for extending the mandates of the National Assembly and other institutions—a three-year extension would be beneficial to the course of Niger&#x27;s development. Prime Minister Seyni Oumarou was among those taking part in the rally. The opposition furiously denounced this proposal, and a large demonstration opposing the proposal was held in Niamey a few days later. On 30 December 20 non-governmental organizations and unions, including the Democratic Confederation of Workers of Niger (CDTN), formed the United Front for the Safeguarding of Democratic Gains (FUSAD) in opposition to the extension proposal, and they called on Tandja—who had up to that point expressed no opinion on the matter in public—to speak out against the proposal.

The relationship with the French nuclear company Areva, which had enjoyed a &quot;de facto&quot; four decade monopoly in the country, worsened under Tandja as he sought to curb the power of French influence by striking a deal with Sino-U in 2007 to develop a uranium mine, resulting in competition for Areva.

==2009 constitutional crisis==

In the run-up to the 2009 elections (presidential, Assembly, and municipal), a movement to draft President Tandja for a third term appeared. Led by public figures of the MNSD outside government, the group took the name of Tandja&#x27;s 2004 re-election slogan, &quot;Tazartché&quot;: a Hausa word meaning &quot;Continuity&quot;. Through several well funded and well attended public rallies in late 2008, the President remained silent on the calls for him to remain. The 1999 constitution not only limited the president to two terms (article 36), but explicitly barred amending this provision by any means (article 136). Prime Minister Seyni Oumarou reiterated on 22 January that all scheduled elections would go ahead before the end of 2009. In March, during his meetings with French President Sarkozy, Tandja explicitly stated that he would not seek a third term.

Then, in early May 2009, when questioned by the press on his visit to Agadez to begin peace talks with Tuareg rebels, Tandja announced he would seek a third term, saying. &quot;The people have demanded I remain; I cannot ignore their call.&quot; His spokesman then outlined a plan in which a referendum could be held in mid-2009, not to amend the 1999 constitution, but to scrap it and begin work on a constitution of the Sixth Republic of Niger, which would contain no term limits for the President, and create a fully presidential republic.

On 15 May 2009, in response to their parties&#x27; opposition to a proposed referendum to allow the President to seek a third term, the three members of RDP-Jama&#x27;a and ANDP-Zaman Lahiya were replaced with ministers drawn from the MNSD-Nassara. With the continued support of the CDS, the MNSD maintained a working majority of 67 seats in the 113-seat National Assembly.

According to the 1999 Constitution of Niger, the President may call a referendum on any matter (except for a revision of those elements of the Constitution outlined in Article 136—including the presidential term limits). The Constitutional Court of Niger and the National Assembly of Niger must advise the president, but there is no provision that the president must heed their advice. On 25 May 2009, the Constitutional Court, made up of appointed judges, released a ruling that any referendum to create a new constitution would not only be unconstitutional, but would violate the oath Tandja had sworn on the Qur&#x27;an (a serious matter in this overwhelmingly Muslim country). The week prior, two major parties had come out in their opposition to the referendum proposal as well. On 13 May, the ANDP-Zaman Lahiya, led by Moumouni Adamou Djermakoye, declared its opposition to any change in the constitution. On 15 May the CDS-Rahama, the party without which the MNSD could not have formed governments in 1999, 2004, and 2007, came out opposing the referendum, and calling the constitution unalterable. Neither party moved into the opposition, and both Ousmane and Djermokoye said they were willing to negotiate with the president.

On 26 May, within hours of the Constitutional Court&#x27;s statement, official media read out a statement that Tandja had dissolved the National Assembly. Under the 1999 Constitution he is allowed to do this once every two years, but he must call parliamentary elections within three months. This would mean the government of Niger would carry out scheduled parliamentary elections in September, two months early, and a referendum on a new constitution before presidential elections which could have been held no later than December, assuming the 1999 constitution was in effect.

Following a ruling by the Constitutional Court, this time binding, that the referendum could not go ahead, the President released a statement on 21 June saying he would forgo the referendum, at least for the near future. But on 24 June he released a further statement, demanding the court reverse its ruling. This was immediately (the 25th) followed by a previously postponed one day general strike by seven labor confederations, and the abandonment of his government by the CDS-Rahama party of Mahamane Ousmane.

On 27 June, President Tandja announced he was suspending the government and would rule by decree. On 27 June, the leader of the main opposition party, Mahamadou Issoufou, denounced what he called a coup, and called on Nigeriens to resist by all legal means, citing Article 13 of the 1999 Constitution which mandates officials to ignore &quot;manifestly illegal orders&quot;.

==February 2010 coup==

On 18 February 2010, during a government meeting at the presidential palace, rebel soldiers attacked and deposed Tandja in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, establishing a military junta called the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy (CSRD). Tandja was believed to be held at a military barracks on the outskirts of Niamey.

The junta kept Tandja in detention while it organized a political transition. He was held under house arrest and then moved to a prison in January 2011. Tandja&#x27;s mother, having reached a very advanced age, died in March 2011.

The junta held elections in 2011, which were won by Issoufou, who led the opposition to Tandja during the 10 years of the latter&#x27;s presidency. The transition ended with Issoufou taking office in April 2011. A month later, the Niamey Court of Appeal threw out all of the legal charges against Tandja, and he was released on 10 May 2011. MNSD officials, including party leader Seyni Oumarou, promptly went to his home to greet and congratulate him, but it was not immediately clear whether he planned to return to active politics.

== Illness and death ==
Tandja suffered from an illness in his final years and travelled to France, Germany and Morocco for medical treatment. He died on 24 November 2020 in Niamey at the age of 82.

<doc id="617808" wikidata="Q712311" url="?curid=617808" title="Arthur's Seat">
<text>Arthur&#x27;s Seat (, ) is an ancient extinct volcano that is the main peak of the group of hills in Edinburgh, Scotland, which form most of Holyrood Park, described by Robert Louis Stevenson as &quot;a hill for magnitude, a mountain in virtue of its bold design&quot;. It is situated just to the east of the city centre, about to the east of Edinburgh Castle. The hill rises above the city to a height of , provides excellent panoramic views of the city and beyond, is relatively easy to climb, and is popular for hillwalking. Though it can be climbed from almost any direction, the easiest ascent is from the east, where a grassy slope rises above Dunsapie Loch. At a spur of the hill, Salisbury Crags has historically been a rock climbing venue with routes of various degrees of difficulty. Rock climbing was restricted to the South Quarry, but access was banned altogether in 2019 by Historic Environment Scotland.

== Name ==
It is sometimes said that its name is derived from legends pertaining to King Arthur, such as the reference in &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;. Some support for this may be provided by several other hilltop and mountaintop features in Britain which bear the same or similar names, such as the peak of Ben Arthur (The Cobbler) in the western highlands, sometimes known as Arthur&#x27;s Seat, and Arthur&#x27;s Chair on the ridge called Stone Arthur in the English Lake District. 

== Geology ==
Arthur&#x27;s Seat is the largest of the three parts of the Arthur&#x27;s Seat Volcano site of special scientific interest (the other parts being Calton Hill and the Castle Rock) which is designated to protect its important geology (see below), grassland habitats and uncommon plant and animal species.

Like the rock on which Edinburgh Castle is built, it was formed by a volcanic system of early Carboniferous age (lava samples have been dated at 341 to 335 million years old), which was eroded by a glacier moving from west to east during the Quaternary (approximately the last two million years), exposing rocky crags to the west and leaving a tail of material swept to the east. This is how the Salisbury Crags formed and became basalt cliffs between Arthur&#x27;s Seat and the city centre. From some angles, Arthur&#x27;s Seat resembles a lion couchant. Two of the several extinct vents make up the &#x27;Lion&#x27;s Head&#x27; and the &#x27;Lion&#x27;s Haunch&#x27;.
Arthur&#x27;s Seat and the Salisbury Crags adjoining it helped form the ideas of modern geology as it is currently understood. It was in these areas that James Hutton observed that the deposition of the sedimentary and formation of the igneous rocks must have occurred at different ages and in different ways than the thinking of that time said they did. It is possible to see a particular area known as Hutton&#x27;s Section in the Salisbury Crags where the magma forced its way through the sedimentary rocks above it to form the dolerite sills that can be seen in the Section.

The hill bears a strong resemblance to the Cavehill in Belfast in terms of its geology and proximity to a major urban site.

== Human history ==

A hill fort occupies the summit of Arthur&#x27;s Seat and the subsidiary hill, Crow Hill.

Hill fort defences are visible round the main massif of Arthur&#x27;s Seat at Dunsapie Hill and above Samson&#x27;s Ribs, in the latter cases certainly of prehistoric date. These forts are likely to have been centres of power of the Votadini, who were the subject of the poem &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;, which is thought to have been written about 600 AD.
Two stony banks on the east side of the hill represent the remains of an Iron Age hill-fort and a series of cultivation terraces are obvious above the road just beyond and best viewed from Duddingston.
On 1 May 1590, to celebrate the safe return of James VI of Scotland and Anna of Denmark, a bonfire was lit that night on the Salisbury Crags fuelled with ten loads of coal and six barrels of tar.

A track rising along the top of the slope immediately under Salisbury Crags has long been a popular walk, giving a view over the city. It became known as the Radical Road after it was paved in the aftermath of the Radical War of 1820, using the labour of unemployed weavers from the west of Scotland at the suggestion of Walter Scott as a form of work relief. This route has been closed since 2018 after 50 tons of rock fell from the cliffs above.

In 1836 five boys hunting for rabbits found a set of 17 miniature coffins containing small wooden figures in a cave on the crags of Arthur&#x27;s Seat. The purpose has remained a mystery ever since the discovery. A strong contemporary belief was that they were made for witchcraft, though more recently it has been suggested that they might be connected with the murders committed by Burke and Hare in 1828. There were 16 known victims of the serial-killers plus the first person sold &quot;to the doctors&quot;, namely a man who had died of natural causes. However, the murder victims were primarily female, while the eight surviving figures are male. Alternatively, the coffins may have represented the 16 bodies sold to the doctors, plus that of the final victim who remained unburied at the time of the duo&#x27;s arrest, but was, as a destitute beggar, very likely dissected in any case. The surviving coffins are now displayed in Edinburgh&#x27;s National Museum of Scotland.

The prominence of Arthur&#x27;s Seat over Edinburgh has attracted various groups and has a particular significance to the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, because this is where the nation of Scotland was dedicated in 1840 &quot;for the preaching of the gospel&quot;. The apostle, Orson Pratt, arrived in Scotland in early 1850 and climbed the hill to pray to God for more converts.

In 1884, alpine mountain guide Emile Rey visited Edinburgh where he climbed Arthur&#x27;s Seat, local tradition stating that before doing so he estimated it would take much of the day to reach the top.

== Mythology ==
Arthur&#x27;s Seat is often mentioned as one of the possible locations for Camelot, the legendary castle and court of the Romano-British warrior-chief, King Arthur.

Tradition has it that it was at the foot of Arthur&#x27;s Seat, covered by the forest of Drumselch, that Scotland&#x27;s 12th-century king David I encountered a stag while out hunting. Having fallen from his horse and about to be gored, he had a vision of a cross appearing between the animal&#x27;s antlers, before it inexplicably turned away, leaving him unharmed. David, believing his life had been spared through divine intervention, founded Holyrood Abbey on the spot. The burgh arms of the Canongate display the head of the stag with the cross framed by its antlers.

The slopes of the hill facing Holyrood are where young girls in Edinburgh traditionally bathe their faces in the dew on May Day to make themselves more beautiful. The poem &quot;Caller Water&quot; (fresh cool water), written by Robert Fergusson in 1773, contains the lines:

<doc id="617831" wikidata="Q1133242" url="?curid=617831" title="Semicircle">
<text>In mathematics (and more specifically geometry), a semicircle is a one-dimensional locus of points that forms half of a circle. It is a circular arc that measures 180° (equivalently, radians, or a half-turn). It only has one line of symmetry (reflection symmetry).

In non-technical usage, the term &quot;semicircle&quot; is sometimes used to refer to either a closed curve that also includes the diameter segment from one end of the arc to the other or to the half-disk, which is a two-dimensional geometric region that further includes all the interior points.

By Thales&#x27; theorem, any triangle inscribed in a semicircle with a vertex at each of the endpoints of the semicircle and the third vertex elsewhere on the semicircle is a right triangle, with a right angle at the third vertex.

All lines intersecting the semicircle perpendicularly are concurrent at the center of the circle containing the given semicircle.

==Arithmetic and geometric means==
A semicircle can be used to construct the arithmetic and geometric means of two lengths using straight-edge and compass. For a semicircle with a diameter of &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;, the length of its radius is the arithmetic mean of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; (since the radius is half of the diameter).

The geometric mean can be found by dividing the diameter into two segments of lengths &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, and then connecting their common endpoint to the semicircle with a segment perpendicular to the diameter. The length of the resulting segment is the geometric mean. This can be proven by applying the Pythagorean theorem to three similar right triangles, each having as vertices the point where the perpendicular touches the semicircle and two of the three endpoints of the segments of lengths &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.

The construction of the geometric mean can be used to transform any rectangle into a square of the same area, a problem called the quadrature of a rectangle. The side length of the square is the geometric mean of the side lengths of the rectangle. More generally, it is used as a lemma in a general method for transforming any polygonal shape into a similar copy of itself with the area of any other given polygonal shape.

==Farey diagram==

The Farey sequence of order &quot;n&quot; is the sequence of completely reduced fractions which when in lowest terms have denominators less than or equal to &quot;n&quot;, arranged in order of increasing size. With a restricted definition, each Farey sequence starts with the value 0, denoted by the fraction , and ends with the fraction . Ford circles can be constructed tangent to their neighbours, and to the x-axis at these points. Semicircles joining adjacent points on the x-axis pass through the points of contact at right angles.

==Equation==

The equation of a semicircle with midpoint formula_1 on the diameter between its endpoints and which is entirely concave from below is

:formula_2

If it is entirely concave from above, the equation is

:formula_3

==Arbelos==

An arbelos is a region in the plane bounded by three semicircles connected at their endpoints, all on the same side of a straight line (the &quot;baseline&quot;) that contains their diameters.

<text>Velimir &quot;Velja&quot; Ilić (, ; born 28 May 1951) is a Serbian politician and founder and president of the New Serbia party. He served as the Minister of Capital Investments from 2004 to 2008, Ministry of Construction and Urbanism from 2012 to 2014, and Minister without portfolio in charge of Emergency Situations from 2014 to 2016.

==Early years and education==
Following the graduation from the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Faculty of Technology (Department of Construction Materials), he worked for various construction firms, and then became a private entrepreneur himself in 1986.

In 2005, he obtained his master&#x27;s degree from the University of Kragujevac. His qualification was granted by an academic supervisory board entirely composed of officials of his own New Serbia party. The academics who granted his degree stated they acted purely as academics in this case and not as party officials under the leadership of their student.

==Political career==
Velja&#x27;s first political steps were taken with Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) in 1990. He quickly rose in the party hierarchy by forming a strong local branch in Čačak. His personable nature and imposing personality, quickly marked him out on the local political scene.

===Mayor of Čačak 1996–2004===
Ilić was elected as the mayor of Čačak in 1996 after defeating the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) candidate. Shortly thereafter, in 1997 following the breakup of Zajedno coalition, he left the SPO, where he was the president of party&#x27;s local branch, and founded his own New Serbia party.

During his tenure, Čačak became a small haven of anti-Milošević struggle similar to few other cities where different opposition parties held municipal power. Ilić ran the city successfully, attracting legitimate investors and developing local economy. He was extremely vocal and direct in his criticism of Slobodan Milošević and his regime, so much so that he was forced into hiding during the NATO airstrikes during Spring 1999, fearing brutal reprisal at a time when the regime often engaged in the practice of eliminating political opponents under the shield of NATO bombs.

In 2000 Ilić&#x27;s New Serbia joined the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition along with 17 other parties. Ilić had a large role in the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević as he organized and headed a long motorcade of cars, buses and trucks that left Čačak on the morning of October 5, 2000 and arrived in Belgrade after going through (often forcefully) numerous police road blocks and check points along the way. Ilić and his men then positioned themselves right in front of the Federal Assembly building, addressed the crowd, which was already gathered in hundreds of thousands, and eventually led the charge on Parliament.

In the immediate days and months after the successful overthrow, Ilić enjoyed wide praise and enormous popularity. So, many, including Ilić himself, were surprised and unhappy about him getting very little in the subsequent division of power among the DOS members. In comparison, many other leaders of small parties within DOS that had considerably lesser profile than NS and Ilić, like Vladan Batić, Dušan Mihajlović, Goran Svilanović, Nebojša Čović, Rasim Ljajić, Žarko Korać, Dragan Veselinov, József Kasza, Mile Isakov, etc., all received high posts. Ilic on the other hand only got to be MP in the federal Parliament of Serbia and Montenegro in addition to his mayoral duties in Čačak.

So, even though he started out as a prominent member of the ruling coalition, Ilić&#x27;s role was effectively marginalized over the coming years. He reportedly had an understanding with Zoran Đinđić that he&#x27;d be DOS&#x27; candidate for the President of Serbia, but nothing materialized in that regard. Since he didn&#x27;t have a national platform through a high-ranking government position, Ilić was seldom featured in the media for anything other than his frequent outburst or spats with reporters.

===Minister of Capital Investment 2004–2008===
In late 2003 after dissolution of Serbia&#x27;s parliament in anticipation of new elections, he reached out to his old friend Vuk Drašković (also a political non-factor at this point) and their parties entered a pre-election coalition. Surprising many, they managed to get 22 parliamentary seats, which they used to form a minority government with Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) and G17 Plus party. Drašković became the Foreign Minister of Serbia-Montenegro, while Ilić got the position of Serbia&#x27;s Minister for Capital Investment.

After elections in 2007, Ministry for Capital Investments was dissolved into three ministries. Ilić became minister of newly formed Ministry for Infrastructure.

Ilić was nominated for president in 2008 election by New Serbia with support of Democratic Party of Serbia, United Serbia and List for Sandžak. He finished third with 7.43% of votes.

==Controversy==
Throughout his political career, Ilić has maintained a colourful public persona, including numerous public outbursts of profanity-punctuated anger that were especially frequent during his time as the mayor of Čačak.

On 28 March 2001, taking a reporter&#x27;s question/insinuation about being behind an incident at Čačak&#x27;s Radio Ozon that saw the station&#x27;s windows shattered by a group of unknown attackers, Ilić denied involvement by answering: &quot;We&#x27;re not some petty Gypsies. When we wreck something, grass doesn&#x27;t grow there again&quot;.

At a press conference held in Čačak on 6 August 2001, Ilić referred to the &quot;Večernje novosti&quot; reporter Milena Marković as &quot;a teenage Belgrade junkie&quot; before proceeding to label &quot;Novosti&quot;&#x27;s editor-in-chief Manojlo Vukotić a &quot;disgrace to Serbian journalism whose asking price is 100 Deutsche Marks in cash and a bottle of beer&quot;.

While denying allegations from a &quot;Nedeljni Telegraf&quot; piece by Dragan Novaković, headlined &quot;Cypriot Partners of Velimir Ilić, Part of the Biggest Tobacco Mafia in Europe&quot;, Ilić made thinly veiled threats of violence against the &quot;Nedeljni Telegraf&quot; reporter, saying: &quot;If I had really wanted to beat him up, he wouldn&#x27;t have a single tooth left in his head now&quot;.

Ilić&#x27;s best known public outburst occurred during a summer 2002 live phone-in on the Studio B radio station while being asked about road blocks that Serb refugees from Kosovo had supposedly set up in protest throughout different parts of the country. Being completely unaware of any protests, Ilić asked the host to clarify at which point the host explained that the Serbian government coordinator for Kosovo Nebojša Čović made a claim about the refugees being organized by Ilić. Upon hearing this, Ilić began his verbal tirade: &quot;&quot;Listen to me now, Nebojša Čović is a communist piece of garbage and a Belgrade scumbag and you&#x27;re free to quote me on that anywhere you want. That sick bastard should go to a sanatorium, somewhere, and I&#x27;ll be happy to pay for his treatment&quot;. After somewhat settling down, Ilić informed the host about having been at home for days recovering from bronchitis and being unaware about any protests, but soon fired up again, this time against the Studio B radio station itself: &quot;all of you bastards at Studio B can suck my cock, and also make sure to take good care of yourselves because I&#x27;ll come to that shitty station of yours and throw all of you out the window&quot;. Ilić ended his outburst by blasting Studio B TV journalist Olja Bećković, calling her &quot;a jerkoff&quot; and adding &quot;If she was better looking, I&#x27;d let her suck me off, but she&#x27;s way too ugly&quot;&quot;.

On 11 October 2002, as part of their call-in show &quot;Naslovna strana&quot; TV Čačak ran a story by journalist Jelena Katanić alleging that recently slain mobster Sredoje Šljukić was a member of Ilić&#x27;s New Serbia. Ilić immediately called the station live and started insulting the journalist as well as the story editor. The very next day, accompanied by his personal security, he barged into the TV station&#x27;s offices and shouted some more at journalists Jelena Katanić and Vesna Radović who happened to be present. Three days later, he held a press-conference saying the story violated the pre-election silence (second round runoff presidential elections contested between Vojislav Koštunica and Miroljub Labus were held on October 13) even if neither candidate was so much as mentioned in the story. Ilić also put forth his, by now usual insinuation that TV Čačak employees are all junkies and should seek treatment.

In June 2003, angered by a question from Novi Sad&#x27;s TV Apolo journalist Vladimir Ješić about alleged ties of Ilić&#x27;s brother Strahinja with organized crime and the construction of a tobacco factory in Čačak, Ilić stood up, kicked the open binder Ješić held in his lap, called him gay, and left the studio.

After getting appointed Serbia&#x27;s Minister of Capital Investment in March 2004, Ilić somewhat cleaned up his act, though still causing plenty of public image problems for the cabinet he represented. On one occasion he infamously threatened to &quot;&quot;chop off&quot; (Minister of Finance) &quot;Mlađan Dinkić&#x27;s fingers&quot;. Dinkić&#x27;s party, G17 Plus threatened to leave the ruling coalition if Ilić did not apologize.

In August 2005, dissatisfied with the question posed to him, Capital Investment Minister Ilić verbally assaulted a B92 journalist calling her &quot;mentally disturbed&quot;&quot; and threatening to kill her and her editor. After a public scandal and an outcry in the media and the public, the government called an emergency session to discuss the issue. Ilić declined to comment or apologize, citing he was the victim of a media smear campaign. Later that day a government statement expressing regret was issued and read by another cabinet minister without an explicit apology or any repercussion for Mr. Ilić.

Ilić called B92 journalist Svetlana Zarić, a &quot;monster&quot;.

Ilić called Bojan Kostreš, President of the Assembly of Vojvodina a &quot;sect member, drug addict, and separatist&quot; in a TV interview on September 6, 2007.

In reaction to the February 2008 declaration of Kosovo independence, Ilić made an indirect threat to the Liberal Democratic Party of Serbia (LDP) leader Čedomir Jovanović (one of the few Serbian politicians who openly advocate in favour of the independence of the Serbian province), saying he should feel &quot;lucky if he stays alive until March, but that it will not be easy.&quot;

In 2009, Ilić accused Nenad Čanak of using drugs. Nenad Čanak subsequently took a drug test which turned out to be negative after which he decided to sue Ilić for defamation.

In February 2009, Ilić was accused of hate speech. leading to the Public Prosecutor opening an investigation into Ilić&#x27;s conduct. Speaking in the parliament, Ilić questioned whether it is appropriate for a Muslim politician Rasim Ljajić to send invitations for the statehood day celebration. Ilić later said that he was misunderstood and that he only question whether it was appropriate for a cabinet minister instead of a president to hand out invitations for such an important event. Ilić also suffered a minor stroke on that day.

==Personal life==
Ilić has five children with three different women. From the marriage with his first wife, he has a daughter. From his second marriage to Ljubinka, Ilić has two more children. Ilić is currently married to Gorica with whom he also has two children - daughter Natalija and son Jovan.

<doc id="617834" wikidata="Q5959" url="?curid=617834" title="Quintus Curtius Rufus">
<text>Quintus Curtius Rufus (; ) was a Roman historian, probably of the 1st century, author of his only known and only surviving work, &quot;Historiae Alexandri Magni&quot;, &quot;Histories of Alexander the Great&quot;, or more fully &quot;Historiarum Alexandri Magni Macedonis Libri Qui Supersunt&quot;, &quot;All the Books That Survive of the Histories of Alexander the Great of Macedon.&quot; Much of it is missing.

Apart from his name on the manuscripts, nothing else is known of him, leading philologists to believe that he had another unknown historical identity. A few theories exist and are treated with varying degrees of credibility. Meanwhile, the identity of Quintus Curtius Rufus, historian, is maintained separately.

==The historical &quot;alter ego&quot;==
Curtius&#x27; work is uniquely isolated. No other ancient work refers to it, or as far as is known, to him. Peter Pratt pointing out that the Senate and emperors frequently proscribed or censored works, suggests that Curtius had not published the manuscript before his death, but left it in care of the emperor. The emperors intended to publish it posthumously but did not find a political opportunity. They had adopted the identity of Alexander for themselves. The provinces fashioned from the Macedonian Empire were difficult to govern, always on the point of rebellion. The work of Curtius, Pratt conjectures, was not politically appropriate because it would have encouraged independence.

The earliest opportune moment was the year 167, when the campaign of the emperor Marcus Aurelius against the Parthian Empire had failed, and the returning troops were in bad morale and infected with the Antonine Plague. The emperor attempted to build national pride among the former Macedonian states. Avidius Cassius, commandant of Legio III Gallica, returning veterans, was promoted to Consul. He claimed descent from the Seleucids of Macedonia. New coins and medals were issued in Macedonia on Alexandrian themes. Pratt conjectures that the manuscript in storage, by this time damaged and partly destroyed, was published finally, accounting for the previous lack of references to it. It is also possible Books I and II along with other loci were censored out. As the emperors probably had surmised, it was immediately popular.

===Most credible date===

The dating available relies entirely on internal evidence, which is not certain but offers some degree of preponderance. In Book X Curtius digresses to give an encomium on blessings of peace under the empire, citing the Roman Empire with the implication of contemporaneity. In essence he reasserts the policy of Augustus, which casts the empire as the restoration of monarchy for the suppression of the civil wars fomented by the contention of powerful noblemen vying for control of the Republic. Curtius&#x27; glowing endorsement of the policy dates him to the Roman Empire.

He also mentions the Parthian Empire. It was formed by the eastern satrapies recusing themselves from Greek overlordship and restoring a purely Iranian empire. It defended itself successfully against Rome, even though Rome absorbed what was left of the Macedonian kingdoms. The dates of the Parthian Empire are 247 BC through 224 AD. Although Curtius may have been writing about an empire that vanished in his own day, the most straightforward approach assumes that he wrote in a window, 63 BC (start of the Roman Empire) through 224 AD.

For further localization, the same imperial purple passage contrasts the civil wars of the Macedonians (Diadochi wars) due to failure to obtain a stable emperor, with an incident of the Roman Empire in which the risk of the civil war was avoided by the appointment of a new emperor in a single night. Not very many incidents fit the description. Baynham summarizes the argument of Julius Nützell that the crisis might be the night of 24/25 January, 41 AD, following the assassination of Caligula on that day. The Senate met on an emergency basis to debate whether the Roman Republic should be restored. The Praetorian Guard forced its way in to insist on the appointment of Caligula&#x27;s uncle, Claudius. His reign concentrated on the restoration of the rule of law. A lawyer, he issued up to 20 imperial edicts per day, re-establishing the Pax Romana. If this argument is correct, Curtius&#x27; work must be dated to after 41 AD.

The upper limit is provided by a passage that mentions the &quot;continued prosperity of Tyre under Roman dominion.&quot; The peace of the empire came to an end in 43 AD when Claudius invaded Britain. None of these dates are certain, but the union of all the ranges presents a credible view of Curtius&#x27; date. Baynham says: &quot;many modern scholars now accept a date in the middle to late part of the first century A.D. as a likely floruit for Curtius.&quot;

===Most credible identity===
By his name, Quintus Curtius Rufus was a member of the &quot;Curtii Rufi&quot; branch of the Curtii family, one of the original nobility of Rome. Due to the frequently used institution of adoption, people of the name &quot;Curtius&quot; (or female &quot;Curtia&quot;) might not be consanguineous. Moreover, the same name tended to be repeated, typically from grandfather to grandson. After centuries of &quot;Curtii&quot;, a &quot;Curtius&quot; might turn up in history at any location or in any period.

The candidates for the historical identity of the author are but few. Given the time frame of the mid-1st century, however, there is a credible candidate. He is a certain Curtius Rufus (The praenomen has been omitted. Presumably it is Quintus.) In the List of Roman consuls he served as Consul Suffectus for October through December, 43 AD under the emperor Claudius. He had been a protégé of Tiberius.

He must have written the &quot;Histories&quot; in a year or two before the consulship. Tacitus says that he was on the staff of the Quaestor of Africa during that time, which would have given him the opportunity to use the Library of Alexandria. Tiberius had died in 37; Caligula was emperor then. Curtius&#x27; relations with Caligula are not mentioned. But Caligula was not in his vicinity.

On Curtius&#x27; return, a book such as the &quot;Historiae&quot; unless politically incorrect would have impressed the scholarly Claudius. Tiberius already had been an admirer before the book: he said that Curtius Rufus was his own ancestor; i.e., a self-made man. Tacitus hints that Curtius was of low birth, possibly the son of a gladiator. The story is only compatible with the name if one assumes adoption, which Tiberius could easily have arranged,

If Curtius took office at the minimum age of 25, and Tiberius made his comment in the year of his own death, Curtius would have been 19 or younger when described as a self-made man. In an age when Alexander had become regent of Macedon at 16, a rise to fame at 19, and consulship at 25, would not have been incredible. Tiberius would have been a senior emperor when Curtius came to his attention. What his qualifications were for the patronage remain obscure. If, on the other hand, Quintus Curtius Rufus is to be identified with Curtius Rufus, Consul Suffect of 43, then the most likely circumstantial evidence places his birth in the early years of the 1st century, in the reign of Augustus.

==The &quot;Historiae&quot;==
===Manuscripts and editions===
&quot;Historiae&quot; survives in 123 codices, or bound manuscripts, all deriving from an original in the 9th century. As it was a partial text, already missing large pieces, they are partial as well. They vary in condition. Some are more partial than others, with lacunae that developed since the 9th century. The original contained ten &quot;libri&quot;, &quot;books,&quot; equivalent to our chapters. Book I and II are missing, along with any Introduction that might have been expected according to ancient custom. There are gaps in V, VI, and X. Many &quot;loci&quot;, or &quot;places,&quot; throughout are obscure, subject to interpretation or emendation in the name of restoration.

The work enjoyed popularity in the High Middle Ages. It is the main source for a genre of tales termed the Alexander Romance (some say romances); for example, Walter of Chatillon&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Alexandreis&quot;, which was written in the style of Virgil&#x27;s Aeneid. These romances spilled over into the Renaissance, especially of Italy, where Curtius was idolized. Painters, such as Paolo Veronese and Charles Le Brun, painted scenes from Curtius.

The &quot;Editio Princeps&quot;, or first printed edition, was published in 1470 or 1471 at Venice by Vindelinus Spirensis. A slow but steady stream of editions appeared subsequently until more of a need for standardization was perceived. In 1867 Edmund Hedicke instigated a convention that persists yet. He based his edition of that year on the five best manuscripts.

===The vulgate authors===
In what remains of his work, Curtius mainly does not identify sources. They were, perhaps, stated in the missing books. Speculations of what they were based on thorough analysis of the content and style vary widely. Yardley and Heckel say: &quot;The internal evidence for Curtius&#x27; sources is disappointing.&quot; He does, however, mention Cleitarchus, a historian in camp, twice, Ptolemy once, and Timagenes once. These men were participants in the Alexander story and therefore are counted as eyewitnesses, or primary sources. All accounts based on them are by analogy also termed &quot;primary.&quot; These works are also called &quot;the Vulgate.&quot;

<text>The benefactive case (abbreviated , or sometimes when it is a core argument) is a grammatical case used where English would use &quot;for&quot;, &quot;for the benefit of&quot;, or &quot;intended for&quot;, e.g. &quot;She opened the door &quot;for Tom&quot;&quot; or &quot;This book is &quot;for Bob&quot;&quot;. The benefactive case expresses that the referent of the noun it marks receives the benefit of the situation expressed by the clause.

This meaning is often incorporated in a dative case. In Latin this type of dative is called the &quot;dativus commodi&quot;.

An example of a language with a benefactive case is Basque, which has a benefactive case ending in &quot;-entzat&quot;. Quechua is another example, and the benefactive case ending in Quechua is &quot;-paq&quot;. Tangkhul-Naga (from the Tibeto-Burman group of languages) has the benefactive case marker &quot;&quot;.

In Aymara, the benefactive case is marked with -&quot;taki&quot;, expressing that the referent of the inflected noun benefits from the situation expressed by the verb, or, when there is no verb, that the noun to which it attaches is a recipient, as in the word below:

Benefactive meaning may also be marked on the verb, in a common type of applicative voice.

== Autobenefactive ==
An autobenefactive case or voice marks a case where the agents and the benefactor are one and the same. In Rhinelandic colloquial German, one finds expressions like:
(I smoke a cigarette for myself), where &quot; (for myself) is optional.

In the Colognian language, there is a compulsory autobenefactive for example with the verb &quot; (to pray) when it is used intransitively:
(He is praying).

Similarly, in French one can say, in informal but fully correct language:
(Literally: &quot;I (to) myself smoke a cigarette. I (to) myself do a pause.)

Formally, those forms coincide with reflexives in these languages.

A similar construction is also found in colloquial English with a pronoun that is reflexive in function but not form:

<text>The Army Reserve (AR) () is the reserve land component of the Irish Defence Forces. It is the second line reserve of the Irish Army. The Army Reserve involves active military service on a part-time basis, and is one of three elements of the Reserve Defence Forces, the other two being the First Line Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve (NSR).

It was established on 1 October 2005 to replace and reorganise the previous reserve organisation, and to improve training and courses along the lines of the regular, full-time Permanent Defence Forces (PDF). This reorganisation saw the creation of an overriding Reserve Defence Forces structure which spans both the Army and Naval Service Reserve.

Prior to the 2005 restructure, the land component of the reserve forces was known as the &quot;&quot; (&quot;FCA&quot;) (local defence force), which in turn has its origins in the units formed in the 1920s. Army Reserve elements are now integrated with PDF units, under the &quot;Single Force&quot; framework.

In times of crisis or emergency, Reservists are liable to be called up for permanent service within the state or outside it by the Minister for Defence or Government of Ireland in accordance with the Defence Acts.

==History==

===Early Reserve/Volunteer forces===
In the years following the establishment of the Defence Forces, various classes of Army Reserves were experimented with. Between 1927 and 1939, these comprised several reserve classes.

====Classes====
In May 1927, the &quot;&quot;Class A Reserve&quot; was established and consisted of regular non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and men transferred to the Reserve. Though numbers never exceeded 5,000, they were the best trained of the reserves, with over 80% reporting annually for training.

In January 1928, the &quot;Class B Reserve&quot; was formed, with the object of building up the infantry arm of the Defence Forces – on a voluntary basis. Its conditions of service were three months of initial training, followed by one months&#x27; annual training with liability for six years Reserve service. It was not a success however, never exceeding 3,600 in strength, and had practically ceased to exist by 1934.

The &quot;Volunteer Reserve Force&quot; was established in Autumn 1929. No initial training was required – instead members attended parade once weekly, with four weekend camps per year along with fifteen days annual training. It was divided into three units, one Battalion in Dublin, an Artillery Battery in Cork and an Officer Training Corps in third-level universities. A total of 1,229 enlisted in the Officer Training College (OTC), while 987 enlisted in the other two units. The units were disbanded in 1935.

The &quot;Volunteer Force&quot; was established in March 1934. Apart from basic military requirements there was a political consideration in its formation. Fianna Fáil, who had assumed power in 1932, were anxious that the Army should be more representative of the different political persuasions in the country. Since 1924, the Army had been composed of pro-Treaty supporters. It was hoped that this new force would attract men who would be considered anti-Treaty in outlook. To this end a number of men who had prominent anti-Treaty records in the Civil War were commissioned at the initial stages as Administrative Officers.

On 6 November 1935 the &quot;Pearse Regiment&quot;&quot; was added. Named after Pádraig Pearse, this force consisted of three lines of Reserve with varying conditions of service. Those of the first line had to undergo initial training along with a commitment to thirty days annual training, and reached a maximum strength of 10,578 by April 1935. On 1 September 1939 the strength was 257 officers and 6,986 other ranks. The second line consisted of personnel who had been trained in the first line and had been transferred. The third line was intended to be a reserve of specialists in civilian life who would be of value to the Army upon mobilisation.

====Organisation====
The Volunteer Force was the first scheme to make provision for recruitment into all arms of the service. It also provided for the special training of non-commissioned officers and the training of NCOs for commissions. The inclusion of civilian committees (known as ) to help recruiting and administration at a local level was a feature of the Force. The however gradually disappeared and were replaced by committees composed solely of Volunteers. The Volunteers had a distinctive uniform, darker than the ordinary uniform, with black boots, leggings, belts, chromium buttons and badges and forage caps.

Territorially these early volunteer/reserve forces were divided into regimental areas, which took their names from the ancient Irish kingdoms where they were raised;
*The Regiment of Oriel – Counties Louth, Meath and Monaghan.
*The Regiment of Leinster – Counties Kildare, West Wicklow, Wexford and Carlow.
*The Regiment of Dublin – County and Borough of Dublin and East Wicklow.
*The Regiment of Ormond, renamed Ossory in 1935. Counties Kilkenny, Waterford and Tipperary.
*The Regiment of Thomond – Counties Limerick and Clare.
*The Regiment of Connacht – Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.
*The Regiment of Breffni – Counties Cavan, Longford, Leitrim and Sligo.
*The Regiment of Tyrconnell – County Donegal.
*The Regiment of Uisneach – Counties Laois, Offaly and Westmeath.
*The Regiment of Desmond – Counties Cork and Kerry.

===World War II – &quot;The Emergency&quot;===
In response to the various security threats posed during World War II, known in Ireland as &quot;The Emergency&quot;, a new reserve force – the Local Security Force (LSF) – was created on 28 May 1940 as an auxiliary police service. Instituted under a Garda Síochána Act, its activities were to be devoted to auxiliary police and internal security work. Recruiting forms were dispatched to Garda stations on 31 May 1940 and by 16 June of the same year 44,870 members were enrolled.

On 22 June 1940 a decision was taken to divide the force into two groups;
*&quot;A&quot; Group – to act as an auxiliary to the Army.
*&quot;B&quot; Group – to continue as an auxiliary to the Police Force.

By August 1940 the strength had risen to 148,306 and by October of the same year detailed organisations for each group were issued and District Staffs were formed. By the end of 1940 the Army had more or less completed its expansion to a war-time footing and was then in a position to take over the control of &quot;A&quot; Group from the Gardaí. On 1 January 1941 it was handed over to the Command and control of the Army and was given the new title of &quot;The Local Defence Force&quot;/&quot;LDF&quot; (&quot;An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil&quot; / &quot;FCA&quot;).

The &quot;B&quot; Group continued as an auxiliary police force and retained its old name – &quot;The Local Security Force&quot; (LSF). From the military point of view the LDF was the equivalent of many additional battalions to the Defence Forces.

====Local Security Force====
The LSF was organised in groups around each Garda Station. It was organised into sections and squads and its general duties consisted of traffic control, communications, protective duties, transport, and first aid.

While other elements of the Defence Forces devoted most of their time to training, the LSF, while training was important, were required to devote much of their time to actual work. Police duties, patrolling and observation were important aspects of their activities. Unlike the soldier who was trained to act as part of a team, the LSF member acted more like a policeman and therefore more emphasis was placed on training to enable him to act alone.

In the cities and large towns their systems of patrols and beats were designed to coincide with times of local crime peaks. A survey of 200 commendations issued to members include the detection of such crimes as housebreaking, larceny, dangerous driving, saving of life from burning buildings, assistance to Gardaí in need of assistance and others.

They also assisted the Gardaí in searches for reported parachutists, missing persons, and crashed aircraft. They kept a watch for floating mines and provided cordons when required. They also assisted in policing at two General Elections. Assistance to other Government Departments was also provided, and included the distribution to households of tea rationing forms and ration books (March 1941), census of turf cutting (July 1941), a survey of accommodation available for refugees, and the provision of patrols to enforce the regulations governing the movement of cattle on outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.

==== Local Defence Force ====

As noted above, this was the &quot;A&quot; Group of the LSF that had been transferred to the Army in January 1941. With its military status and responsibility, it was integrated into the combat organisations under full military discipline. The main LDF weapons were the rifle, bayonet and grenade. The organisation was mostly one of rifle companies and platoons.

In 1942 the LDF strength was 98,429. In 1943 this rose to 103,530. And in 1944 it was at 96,152. These strengths were regarded as being effective and may reflect a rise and fall as the European battle front approached or receded from Irish shores.

===Establishment of the FCA===

A post-war establishment of 12,500 in all ranks saw a rapid demobilisation and reorganisation within a small period. The Regular Army was now composed of three Brigades.
In 1947 all reserve forces were disestablished and in their place were created the First Line Reserve (FLR) and the Second Line Reserve – An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil (FCA) (Local Defence Force).

The basic principles underlying this establishment were that;
*The three brigades at about half strength could, with their reserves be quickly mobilised to full strength.
*Provide normal garrison and training establishments.
*Provide cadres for the Reserves.

This organisation remained until 1959 when &quot;integration&quot; was introduced by which the FCA was integrated with the Regular Army. Six Brigades of mixed Regular and FCA units, each with only one Regular Battalion were established with the intention that the remaining units would be filled by FCA personnel upon mobilisation.

In 1979 there was a change in the structure and role of the FCA which had existed since the 1959 integration.

The six integrated Infantry Brigades were reduced to four Permanent Defence Force (PDF) Brigades and the Eastern Command Infantry Force (ECIF). A new command structure was set up for the FCA with a Directorate of Reserve Forces.

The Army Reserve was deployed to aid its regular counterparts in support of the Garda Síochána along the border with Northern Ireland during the conflict known as the Troubles (1969–1998).

===Changing role and the RDF===
Confirmed by the Minister for Defence in Dáil Éireann on 15 May 1991, the role of the FCA units changed. They were now to be tasked with local defence and security, reinforcement of Army units with trained manpower, and the replacement of Army units in Barracks should the need arise.

Females were inducted into selected units of the FCA in 1991 and from 1993 all units were permitted to recruit females. In 1997, a Steering Group was convened by the Chief of Staff of the Irish Defence Forces to conduct a special study on the restructuring of the Reserve Defence Forces. The report was completed in May 1999.

On 1 October 2005 the FCA was stood down and the Reserve Defence Forces (RDF), consisting of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve, was established.

In 2013 a major reorganisation was carried out that implemented the &#x27;Single Force Concept&#x27; whereby RDF sub-units would now be attached to PDF Army units.

As of January 2021, reservists had carried out 1,391 duties relating to &quot;Operation Fortitude&quot;, the military&#x27;s contribution to Ireland&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Training==
Enlistment is open to EU and EEA citizens between the ages of 18 and 39 (increased from 35 in 2024), provided they are ordinarily resident in Ireland, can pass a fitness examination, medical examination, are of good character, obtain a security clearance, and also to non-EU citizens who have been continuously legally resident in the state for at least three years. Former members of the Reserve and Permanent Defence Forces who have had not less than one year&#x27;s uninterrupted military service can apply to join/rejoin the Army Reserve up to the age of 45.

All enlisted members of the Reserve Defence Forces undergo recruit training on a part-time basis, receiving professional military training. This training takes place mostly on weekends, weekday evenings and annual full-time training (FTT). Recruits must also undergo full-time paid training for at least 2 continuous weeks in a year and pass proficiency tests on foot drill, arms drill, tactics, physical fitness and rifle training with the Steyr AUG 5.56mm assault rifle to qualify as a 2 Star Private.

3 Star training includes navigation, training on the FN MAG general-purpose machine gun (GPMG), fieldcraft, combat first aid, public order training and tactical training, which takes place on weekends, &quot;field days&quot; and &quot;parade nights&quot; and there is also a requirement to undergo at least 14 continuous days full-time paid training. The recruit to fully trained 3* soldier syllabus now takes 2 years part-time to complete.

After recruit training, soldiers then undergo continuation training in their respective corps, each corps has a designated specialised military task and soldiers must learn the various skills used by their corps. All soldiers are taught to operate radio communications, map reading, CBRN warfare defence and the light machine gun, and can move on to courses such as reconnaissance (&quot;recce course&quot;), driving courses, Regimental Signallers course, Physical Training Leader and Specialist Instructor Course. 

Steps up the Defence Forces career ladder include the Potential Non-Commissioned Officer&#x27;s course, designed to teach the fundamentals of leadership, the Standard Non-Commissioned Officer course to move from being a Junior to Senior NCO and to prepare NCOs for middle management, and the Potential Commissioned Officer course.

In order to be considered operationally ready (and as criteria to join career progression and promotion courses), personnel must meet annual KPIs including being passed medically fit, passing the Defence Forces annual fitness test, annual personal weapons test (APWT) and complete a minimum amount of mandays and duties with their unit.

==Army Corps==
There are eight Army Corps, organised along the lines of the PDF under 1st Brigade, 2nd Brigade, DFTC and DFHQ;
* Infantry Corps
* Artillery Corps
* Cavalry Corps
* Engineer Corps
* CIS Corps
* Transport Corps
* Medical Corps
* Military Police Corps

==Rank structure==

The Army Reserve is organised along the same rank and command structures as the Permanent Defence Forces, however there are some differences.

All ranks within the Reserve Defence Forces are enlisted as recruits. Potential officers are chosen from the non-commissioned ranks - normally only Corporal and Sergeant ranks are selected - but since 2019 any rank holding a &quot;relevant degree&quot; can apply. The Potential Officers course is run over 2 years and is run centrally out of the Cadet School, Military College in the Curragh Camp. There are some Direct Entry routes for officers in the Reserve. This is only available for former Regular Army Officers, and specific direct-entry officer roles such as Medical Officers (Doctors) and Engineering Officers.

Lieutenant Colonel is the most senior rank in the Reserve forces.

==Weapons==

The personnel weapons used are the standard Platoon and Company level weapons of the Irish Defence Forces.

<doc id="617849" wikidata="Q158654" url="?curid=617849" title="Claude Louis Hector de Villars, 1st Duke of Villars">
<text>Claude Louis Hector de Villars, Prince of Martigues, Marquis then (1st) Duke of Villars, Viscount of Melun (, 8 May 1653 – 17 June 1734) was a French military commander and an illustrious general of Louis XIV of France. He was one of only six Marshals to have been promoted Marshal General of France.

==Early career==
Villars was born at Moulins (in the present-day département of Allier) in a noble but poor family, his father was the diplomat Pierre de Villars. He entered the French army through the corps of pages in 1671 and distinguished himself at the age of twenty in the Siege of Maastricht in 1673 during the Franco-Dutch War and again at the bloody Battle of Seneffe. A year later he was promoted on the field to mestre de camp (colonel) of a cavalry regiment.

The next promotion would take time in spite of a long record of service under Turenne, The Great Condé and Luxembourg, and of his aristocratic birth, as he had incurred the enmity of the powerful Louvois. He was finally made &quot;maréchal de camp&quot; in 1687.

In the interval between the Dutch wars and the formation of the League of Augsburg, Villars, who combined with his military gifts the tact and subtlety of a diplomat, was employed in an unofficial mission to the court of Bavaria, and there became the constant companion of Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria.

He returned to France in 1690 and was given a command in the cavalry of the army in Flanders, but towards the end of the War of the Grand Alliance, in 1698, he went to Vienna as ambassador.

==War of the Spanish Succession==

It was Villars&#x27; part in the next war, beginning with Friedlingen (1702) and Hochstadt (1703) and ending with Denain (1712), that has made him most famous. For his part in the battle of Friedlingen he received the marshalate, and for the pacification of the insurgent Cévennes he received the Saint-Esprit order and the title of duke. Friedlingen and Hochstadt were barren victories, and the campaigns of which they formed were characterised by lost opportunities. Villars&#x27; career culminated from 1709 onwards when France, close to total defeat, managed to survive.

In that year he was called to command the main army opposing Prince Eugène of Savoy and Marlborough on the northern frontier. During the famine of the winter he shared the soldiers&#x27; rations. When the campaign opened the old Marshal Boufflers volunteered to serve under him, but they were unable to prevent the Allies from capturing Tournai and Mons. After the Battle of Malplaquet in September 1709, in which Villars was gravely wounded (by a musketball to the knee), he was able to tell the king: &quot;If God grants us the grace to lose such a battle again, Your Majesty can count on all of his enemies being destroyed&quot;.

Two more campaigns passed without a battle and with scarcely any advance on the part of the invaders, but at last Marlborough manoeuvred Villars out of the famous &quot;Ne plus ultra&quot; lines, and the power of the defence seemed to be broken. But Louis made a last effort, the English contingent and its leader were withdrawn from the enemy&#x27;s camp, and Villars, though still recovering from his Malplaquet wounds, outmanoeuvred and decisively defeated Eugène at Denain. The French followed up this success by retaking several lost fortresses, culminating in the Siege of Bouchain (1712). 

This victory saved France, though the war dragged on for another year, where Villars led the Rhine campaign (1713), in which he took Landau, led the stormers at Freiburg and negotiated the Treaty of Rastatt and the Treaty of Baden with Prince Eugène.

As a result of his contribution, his title was granted Grandee of Spain status by Philip V.

==&quot;Villars&quot; residence==
&quot;Villars,&quot; named for Marshal Villars, was built in Moulins, Allier during the reign of Louis XV. The 18th century historical monument was used as a cavalry barracks. It was partially destroyed during World War II and was restored by François Voinchet, Architect of Historic Monuments and is now the Centre National du Costume de Scene museum.

==Regency==

Villars played a conspicuous part in the politics of the Regency period as the principal opponent of Cardinal Dubois, and only the memories of Montmorency&#x27;s rebellion prevented his being made constable of France. He took the field for the last time in the War of the Polish Succession (1734), with the title &quot;marshal-general of the king&#x27;s armies&quot;, that Turenne had held before him. But he was over eighty years old at this point, and after opening the campaign energetically he died at Turin on 17 June 1734.

==Marriage and issue==

On 1 February 1702, he married Jeanne Angélique Roque with whom he had a son:

# Honoré Armand de Villars, 2nd Duke of Villars (4 October 1702 - May 1770) married Amable Gabrielle de Noailles and had a daughter.

==Legacy==
Villars&#x27;s memoirs show us a &quot;fanfaron plein d&#x27;honneur&quot;, as Voltaire calls him. He was indeed boastful, and also covetous of honours and wealth. But he was also described as an honourable man of high courage, moral and physical, and certainly a very skilled soldier. He was famous for his love for young men as wrote the Duchess of Orleans in her letters.

The memoirs, part of which was published in 1734 and afterwards several times republished in untrustworthy versions, were for the first time completely edited by the Marquis of Vogüé in 1884–92.

<text>In Latin literature, Augustan poetry is the poetry that flourished during the reign of Caesar Augustus as Emperor of Rome, most notably including the works of Virgil, Horace, and Ovid. In English literature, Augustan poetry is a branch of Augustan literature, and refers to the poetry of the 18th century, specifically the first half of the century. The term comes most originally from a term that George I had used for himself. He saw himself as an Augustus. Therefore, the British poets picked up that term as a way of referring to their endeavours, for it fit in another respect: 18th-century English poetry was political, satirical, and marked by the central philosophical problem of whether the individual or society took precedence as the subject of the verse.

==Overview==
In the British literary period known as the &#x27;Augustan era,&#x27; poets were more conversant with each other&#x27;s writings than were the contemporary novelists (see Augustan prose). They wrote in counterpoint, directly expanding each other&#x27;s works, and using satire to heighten their oppositional voices. In the early part of the century, there was a great struggle over the nature and role of the pastoral, primarily between Ambrose Philips and Alexander Pope, and then between their followers, but such a controversy was only possible because of two simultaneous literary movements. The general movement, carried forward only with the struggle between poets, was the same as in the novel: the invention of the subjective self as a worthy topic, the emergence of a priority on &quot;individual&quot; psychology, against the insistence that all acts of art are a &quot;performance&quot; and a public gesture meant for the benefit of society at large. Beneath that large banner raged individual battles. The other development, one seemingly agreed upon by both sides, was a gradual expropriation and reinvention of all the Classical forms of poetry. Every genre of poetry was recast, reconsidered, and used to serve new functions. The ode, the ballad, the elegy, and satire, parody, song and lyric poetry, would be adapted from their older, initial literary uses. Odes would cease to be encomia, ballads would cease to be narratives, elegies would cease to be sincere memorials, satires no longer would be specific entertainments, parodies no longer would consist of &quot;bravura&quot;, stylised performances, songs no longer would be personal lyrics, and the lyric would celebrate the individual man and woman, and not the lover&#x27;s complaint.

These two developments (the emphasis on the person and the writer&#x27;s willingness to reinvent genre) can be seen as extensions of Protestantism, as Max Weber argued, for they represent a gradual increase in the implications of Martin Luther&#x27;s doctrine of the priesthood of all believers and the Calvinist emphasis on individual revelation of the divine (and therefore the competence and worth of the individual). It can be seen as a growth of the power and assertiveness of the bourgeoisie and an echo of the displacement of the worker from the home in growing industrialization, as Marxists such as E. P. Thompson has argued, for people were no longer allowed to remain in their families and communities when they had to travel to a factory or mill, and therefore they grew accustomed to thinking of themselves as isolated. It can be argued that the development of the subjective individual against the social individual was a natural reaction to trade over other methods of economic production, or as a reflection of a breakdown in social cohesion unconsciously set in motion by enclosure and the migration of the poor to the cities. There are many other plausible and coherent explanations of the causes of the rise of the &quot;subjective self&quot;, but whatever the prime cause, poets showed the strains of the development as a largely conservative set of voices argued for a social person and largely emergent voices argued for the person.

==Alexander Pope, the Scriblerians, and poetry as social act==
The entire Augustan age&#x27;s poetry was dominated by Alexander Pope. Since Pope began publishing when very young and continued to the end of his life, his poetry is a reference point in any discussion of the 1710s, 1720s, 1730s or even 1740s. Furthermore, Pope&#x27;s abilities were recognized early in his career, so contemporaries acknowledged his superiority, for the most part. Indeed, seldom has a poet been as publicly acknowledged as a leader for as long as was Pope, and, unlike the case with figures such as John Dryden or William Wordsworth, a second generation did not emerge to eclipse his position. From a technical point of view, few poets have ever approached Alexander Pope&#x27;s perfection at the iambic pentameter closed couplet (&quot;heroic verse&quot;), and his lines were repeated often enough to lend quite a few clichés and proverbs to modern English usage. However, if Pope had few rivals, he had many enemies. His technical perfection did not shelter him from political, philosophical or religious opponents, and Pope himself was quarrelsome in print. His very technical superiority led Pope to injudicious improvements in his editing and translation of other authors. However, Pope and his enemies (often called &quot;the Dunces&quot; because of Pope&#x27;s successful satirizing of them in &quot;The Dunciad&quot; of 1727 and 1738) fought over central matters of the proper subject matter for poetry and the proper pose of the poetic voice, and the excesses and missteps as much as the achievements, of both sides demonstrated the stakes of the battle.

The Pope/Philips debate occurred in 1709 when Alexander Pope published his &quot;Pastorals&quot;. Pope&#x27;s &quot;Pastorals&quot; were of the four seasons. When they appeared, Thomas Tickell, a member of the &quot;Little Senate&quot; of Addison&#x27;s (see above) at Button&#x27;s coffee shop wrote an evaluation in &quot;Guardian&quot; that praised Ambrose Philips&#x27;s pastorals above Pope&#x27;s. Pope replied by writing in &quot;Guardian&quot; with rock praise of Philips&#x27;s &quot;Patorals&quot; that heaped scorn on them. Pope quoted Philips&#x27;s worst lines, mocked his execution, and delighted in pointing out his empty lines. Philips responded by putting staff on the floor of Button&#x27;s with which to beat Pope, should he appear. In 1717, Pope explained his theory of the pastoral in the &quot;Discourse on Pastoral Poetry&quot;. He argued that any depictions of shepherds and their mistresses in the pastoral must not be updated shepherds, that they must be icons of the Golden Age: &quot;we are not to describe our shepherds as shepherds at this day really are, but as they may be conceived then to have been when the best of men followed the employment&quot; (Gordon). Philips&#x27;s &quot;Pastorals&quot; were not particularly awful poems, but they did reflect his desire to &quot;update&quot; the pastoral.

In 1724, Philips would update poetry again by writing a series of odes dedicated to &quot;all ages and characters, from Walpole, the steerer of the realm, to Miss Pulteney in the nursery&quot;. To do so, he shortened his line length to 3.5&#x27;, or almost half a normal iambic pentameter line. Henry Carey was one of the best at satirizing these poems, and his &quot;Namby Pamby&quot; became a hugely successful obliteration of Philips and Philips&#x27;s endeavour. What is notable about Philips against Pope, however, is not so much the particular poems and their answers as the fact that &quot;both&quot; poets were adapting the pastoral and the ode, both altering it. Pope&#x27;s insistence upon a Golden Age pastoral no less than Philips&#x27;s desire to update it meant making a political statement. While it is easy to see in Ambrose Philips an effort at modernist triumph, it is no less the case that Pope&#x27;s artificially restricted pastoral was a statement of what the ideal (based on an older Feudal arrangement) should be.
The Scriblerus Club wrote poetry as well as prose, and the club included among its number John Gay, who was not only a friend and collaborator of Pope&#x27;s but also one of the major voices of the era. John Gay, like Pope, adapted the pastoral. Gay, working at Pope&#x27;s suggestion, wrote a parody of the updated pastoral in &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Week&quot;. He also imitated the satires of Juvenal with his &quot;Trivia&quot;. In 1728, his &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; was an enormous success, running for an unheard-of eighty performances. All of these works have in common a gesture of compassion. In &quot;Trivia&quot;, Gay writes as if commiserating with those who live in London and are menaced by falling masonry and bedpan slops, and &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Week&quot; features great detail of the follies of everyday life and eccentric character. Even &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera,&quot; which is a clear satire of Robert Walpole, portrays its characters with compassion. The villains have pathetic songs in their own right and are acting out of exigency rather than boundless evil. Gay&#x27;s tone is almost the opposite of Jonathan Swift&#x27;s. Swift famously said that he hated mankind but loved individual humans, and Gay&#x27;s poetry shows a love of mankind and a gentle mocking of overly serious or pretentious individuals.

Old-style poetic parody involved imitation of the style of an author to amuse, but not for ridicule. The person imitated was not satirized. Ambrose Philips&#x27;s idea was of adapting and updating the pastoral to represent a contemporary lyric (i.e. to make it a form for housing the &quot;personal&quot; love complaints of modern shepherds), where individual personalities would be expressed, and this desire to move from the universal, typical, and idealized shepherd to the real, actual, and individual shepherd was the heart of the debate. Prior to Ambrose Philips, John Philips, whose &quot;The Splendid Shilling&quot; of 1701 was an imitation of John Milton&#x27;s blank verse for a discussion of the miseries of poverty, was championed by Addison&#x27;s Kit-Kats. &quot;The Splendid Shilling&quot;, like Pope&#x27;s poetry and the other poetry by the &quot;Tory Wits&quot;, is a statement of the social man. The shilling, the poverty, and the complaint are all posited in terms of the man in London, the man in society and conviviality, and not the man as a particular individual or with idiosyncrasies. It was a poem wholly consonant with the poetry of the Scribblerians. After Ambrose Philips, though, poets would begin to speak of peculiarities and actualities, rather than ideals. It is a debate and a poetic tension that would remain all the way to Samuel Johnson&#x27;s discussion of the &quot;streaks of the tulip&quot; in the last part of the century (&quot;Rasselas&quot;).

==Translation and adaptation as statement==
Gay adapted Juvenal, as Pope had already adapted Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot;, and throughout the Augustan era the &quot;updating&quot; of Classical poets was a commonplace. These were not translations, but rather they were imitations of Classical models, and the imitation allowed poets to veil their responsibility for the comments they made. Alexander Pope would manage to refer to the King himself in unflattering tones by &quot;imitating&quot; Horace in his &quot;Epistle to Augustus&quot;. Similarly, Samuel Johnson wrote a poem that falls into the Augustan period in his &quot;imitation of Satire III&quot; entitled &quot;London&quot;. The imitation was inherently conservative, since it argued that all that was good was to be found in the old classical education, but these imitations were used for progressive purposes, as the poets who used them were often doing so to complain of the political situation.
Readers of adaptations were assumed to know the originals. Indeed, original translation was one of the standard tests in grammar school. Pope&#x27;s translation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; was not an attempt to make the works available to an Augustan audience, but rather to make a new work occupying a middle ground between Homer and Pope. The translation had to be textually accurate, but it was intended to be a Pope translation, with felicity of phrase and neatness of rhyme from Pope. Additionally, Pope would &quot;versify&quot; John Donne, although his work was widely available. The changes Pope makes are the content, the commentary. Pope&#x27;s edition of Shakespeare claimed to be textually perfect (although it was corrupt), but his desire to adapt led him to injudicious attempts at &quot;smoothing&quot; and &quot;cleaning&quot; Shakespeare&#x27;s lines.

In satire, Pope achieved two of the greatest poetic satires of all time in the Augustan period, and both arose from the imitative and adaptive demands of parody. &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; (1712 and 1714) was a gentle mock-heroic, but it was built upon Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Pope applied Virgil&#x27;s heroic and epic structure to the story of a young woman (Arabella Fermor) having a lock of hair snipped by an amorous baron (Lord Petre). The &quot;structure&quot; of the comparison forced Pope to invent mythological forces to overlook the struggle, and so he borrowed sylphs from ludicrous (to him) alchemist Paracelsus and makes them the ghosts of vain women. He created an epic battle over a game of ombre, leading to a fiendish appropriation of the lock of hair. Finally, a deus ex machina appears and the lock of hair experiences an apotheosis. To some degree, Pope was adapting Jonathan Swift&#x27;s habit, in &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot;, of pretending that metaphors were literal truths, and he was inventing a mythos to go with the everyday. The parody was in no way a comment on Virgil. Instead, it was an imitation made to serve a new purpose. The epic was transformed from a paean to national foundations to a satire on the outlandish self-importance of the country nobility. The poem was an enormous success, at least with the general public.

After that success, Pope wrote some works that were more philosophical and more political and therefore more controversial, such as the &quot;Essay on Criticism&quot; and &quot;Essay on Man&quot;, as well as a failed play. As a result, a decade after the gentle, laughing satire of &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;, Pope wrote his masterpiece of invective and specific opprobrium in &quot;The Dunciad&quot;. Pope had translated Homer and produced an errant edition of William Shakespeare, and the 1727 &quot;Dunciad&quot; was an updating and redirection of John Dryden&#x27;s poison-pen battle of &quot;MacFlecknoe&quot;. The story is that of the goddess Dulness choosing a new avatar. She settles upon one of Pope&#x27;s personal enemies, Lewis Theobald, and the poem describes the coronation and heroic games undertaken by all of the dunces of Great Britain in celebration of Theobald&#x27;s ascension. When Pope&#x27;s enemies responded to &quot;The Dunciad&quot; with attacks, Pope produced the &quot;Dunciad Variorum&quot;, which culled from each dunce&#x27;s attack any comments unflattering to another dunce, assembled the whole into a commentary upon the original &quot;Dunciad&quot; and added a critical comment by Pope professing his innocence and dignity. In 1743, Pope issued a new version of &quot;The Dunciad&quot; (&quot;The Dunciad B&quot;) with a fourth book added. He also changed the hero from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber. In the fourth book of the new &quot;Dunciad&quot;, Pope expressed the view that, in the battle between light and dark (enlightenment and the Dark Ages), Night and Dulness were fated to win, that all things of value were soon going to be subsumed under the curtain of unknowing.

John Gay and Alexander Pope belong on one side of a line separating the celebrants of the individual and the celebrants of the social. Pope wrote &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;, he said, to settle a disagreement between two great families, to laugh them into peace. He wrote the &quot;Essay on Criticism&quot; and the &quot;Essay on Man&quot; to emphasize, time and again, the public nature of human life and the social role of letters. Even &quot;The Dunciad&quot;, which seems to be a serial killing of everyone on Pope&#x27;s enemies list, sets up these figures as expressions of dangerous and &quot;antisocial&quot; forces in letters. Theobald and Cibber are marked by vanity and pride, by having no care for morality, so long as they are famous. The hireling pens Pope attacks mercilessly in the heroic games section of the &quot;Dunciad&quot; are all embodiments of avarice and lies. Similarly, Gay, although he always has strong touches of personal humor and the details of personal life, writes of political society, of social dangers and of follies that must be addressed to protect the greater whole. On the other side of this line, however, were people who agreed with the &quot;politics&quot; of Gay and Pope (and Swift), but not in approach.

==Precursors of Romanticism==
The other side of this division include, early in the Augustan Age, John Dyer, James Thomson and Edward Young. In the year 1726 poems by the two former were published describing landscape from a personal point of view and taking their feeling and moral lessons from direct observation. One was Dyer&#x27;s &quot;Grongar Hill&quot;, the other was James Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Winter&quot;, soon to be followed by all the seasons (1726–30). Both are unlike Pope&#x27;s notion of the Golden Age pastoral as exemplified in his &quot;Windsor Forest&quot;. Mythology is at a minimum and there is no celebration of Britain or the crown. Where the octosyllabic couplets of Dyer&#x27;s poem celebrate the natural beauty of a mountain view and are quietly meditative, the declamatory blank verse of Thomson&#x27;s winter meditation is melancholy and soon to establish that emotion as proper for poetic expression.
A notable successor in that line was Edward Yonge&#x27;s &quot;Night Thoughts&quot; (1742–1744). It was, even more than &quot;Winter&quot;, a poem of deep solitude, melancholy and despair. In all the poems mentioned, there are the stirrings of the lyric as the Romantics would see it: the celebration of the private individual&#x27;s idiosyncratic, yet paradigmatic, responses to the visions of the world. These works appeared in Pope&#x27;s lifetime and were popular, but the older, more conservative poetry maintained its hold for a while to come. On the other hand, Thomas Gray&#x27;s &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot; set off a new craze for poetry of melancholy reflection.

Gray&#x27;s &quot;Elegy&quot; appeared in 1750, and it immediately set new ground. First, it was written in the &quot;country,&quot; and not in or as opposed to London. In fact, the poem makes no reference at all to the life of the city and society, and it follows no classical model. Further, it is not an elegiac in the strictest sense. Also, the poem sets up the solitary observer in a privileged position. It is only by being solitary that the poet can speak of a truth that is wholly individually realized, and the poem is a series of revelations that have been granted only to the contemplative (and superior) mind. After Gray, a group often referred to as the Churchyard Poets began imitating his pose, and occasionally his style. These imitations followed no convenient or conventional political or religious division. Oliver Goldsmith (&quot;The Deserted Village&quot;), Thomas Warton, and even Thomas Percy (&quot;The Hermit of Warkworth&quot;), each conservative by and large and Classicist (Gray himself was a professor of Greek), took up the new poetry of solitude and loss. Additionally, Thomas Chatterton, among the younger poets, also followed. The only things these poets had in common was that they were not centered in London (except Chatterton, for a time), and each of them reflected, in one way or another, on the devastation of the countryside.

Therefore, when the Romantics emerged at the end of the 18th century, they were not assuming a radically new invention of the subjective self themselves, but merely formalizing what had gone before. Similarly, the later 18th century saw a ballad revival, with Thomas Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry.&quot; The relics were not always very ancient, as many of the ballads dated from only the 17th century (e.g. the Bagford Ballads or The Dragon of Wantley in the Percy Folio), and so what began as an antiquarian movement soon became a folk movement. When this folk-inspired impulse combined with the solitary and individualistic impulse of the Churchyard Poets, Romanticism was nearly inevitable.

<doc id="617870" wikidata="Q1254594" url="?curid=617870" title="Dragan Jočić">
<text>Dragan Jočić (, born 7 September 1960) is a Serbian lawyer and politician. He served as the Minister of Internal Affairs of Serbia from 2004 until 2008 in the cabinet of Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.

He has been a member of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) since its inception until 2014. He also served as the party vice-president and has been a member of the party&#x27;s executive board since its founding. From 1992 to 1997, he was an MP in the Serbian parliament. He was also a city council member and has been a member of the Belgrade City Council since 2000.

==Early life and education==
Jočić is of Montenegrin Serb descent, his family originating from Martinići, a village near Danilovgrad, Montenegro. He graduated from the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Law School. After graduation, he started private law practice.

==Car accident==
On 25 January 2008, around 11:30pm CET, Jočić was severely injured in a car crash when a government-issued, chauffeur-driven Mercedes-Benz ML 500 that he was riding in hit a dog on the Belgrade-Niš highway near the town of Velika Plana. After hitting the animal, the driver, Mirko Damnjanović lost control of the vehicle, which then careened into a mid-highway divider, crossed into the oncoming traffic lanes, spun several times, and landed in a ditch. Jočić was then airlifted to Belgrade&#x27;s Banjica orthopedic clinic with spinal injuries where an emergency surgery was performed early Saturday morning on 26 January 2008. Driver Damnjanović was rushed to Belgrade&#x27;s Emergency Center where he also had an emergency surgery. It was initially reported that they&#x27;re both in stable conditions following their surgeries. However, it soon became clear Jočić&#x27;s condition remained life-threatening and a lot more serious than initially predicted and he was put back into intensive care where reanimation measures were performed. On 27 January 2008, a team of Russian neurosurgeons from Burdenko Institute arrived to Belgrade in order to help with Jočić&#x27;s post-surgery recovery process. He then spent three weeks at the Orthopädische Universitätsklinik Balgrist in Zürich, Switzerland, before coming back to Serbia on 11 April 2008 and continuing the rehab at the Dr Miroslav Zotović Rehabilitation Clinic in Belgrade. In January 2009, his condition was reported as &quot;much improved&quot;. However, as of October 2010, Jočić is still unable to walk and has been released from the rehab clinic (after spending two and a half years there) for further rehabilitation at home.

In November 2015, in his first interview after the accident, given to NIN, Jočić said that the country&#x27;s authorities have failed to protect him and give him needed help after the accident. He also stated that: &quot;the length and painful way in which I try to accomplish what belongs to me, so that I can live, offends dignity&quot;.

==Controversy==
After being named Interior Minister on 3 March 2004, several newspapers reported that as a 21-year-old Jočić was directly involved in a 1981 kiosk robbery for which he was convicted to a 6-month conditional jail sentence. He confirmed the stories when asked about them. He later stated that this was his &quot;only mischief as a youth&quot; and that &quot;everybody knows that Dragan Jočić is a good man&quot;. Both claims became a popular catchphrase among those unsympathetic towards his and his party&#x27;s policies.

In September 2004, Jočić became the target of criticism for allegedly trying to influence Dejan Milenković Bagzi, one of the accused in the Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić murder trial who became a protected witness (svedok saradnik). The accusation of meddling in the trial came after the transcripts of Bagzi&#x27;s apparent phone call with his attorney Biljana Kajganić were published. In them, attorney Kajganić allegedly tells her client that she got him the protected witness status after talking to Jočić and BIA chief Rade Bulatović, but that in return he (Bagzi) has to &quot;admit to organizing the killing of Momir Gavrilović in 2001 on orders from Ljubiša &quot;Čume&quot; Buha&quot;. Jočić strenuously denied the charges that he in any way influenced the trial and added that transcripts were forged.

Jočić was blasted again for having a private meeting with the chief suspect for the murder of the Prime Minister Đinđić just minutes after he was arrested. The meeting lasted several hours. Jočić confirmed this, but denied that he broke the law by stating that this was the safest option.

He was also accused by some Serbian press outlets of failing to adequately protect the Belgrade&#x27;s Bajrakli Mosque during riots caused by March 17, 2004 ethnically motivated violence in Kosovo. Jočić reacted by sacking the chief of Belgrade police force even though transcripts of phone calls which they had during the riot clearly proved that he strictly insisted that no force be used against protestors. That eventually led to the significant damage to the mosque.

<text>Ljiljana Čolić (; born 1956) is a Serbian politician who previously served as Minister for Education and Sport in the Government of Serbia.

==Academic career==
Čolić holds a graduate degree in philosophy and a Ph.D. in philology. She is a professor of Ottoman language and paleography at the University of Belgrade as well as an associate professor teaching Turkish at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology; and in Priština, she worked as a guest lecturer at the Faculty of Philosophy. She is a self-avowed &quot;devout Orthodox Christian&quot;.

Čolić was a deputy in the Federal Parliament and one of the founders of the Democratic Party of Serbia. She speaks English and French fluently.

==Political life==
Čolić was named Minister of Education and Sport in March 2004. As a conservative government superseded a reformist one, Dr. Čolić worked to alter and reverse changes from the previous government.

Čolić garnered controversy in September 2004 when she ordered Serbian schools to suspend the teaching of evolution unless they introduced creationism.

Researchers, teachers, the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts and some 40 non-government organisations and human rights groups voiced their concern over such a move, including UNICEF. After widespread protest, on September 9, Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica reversed the decision and announced that Čolić would be replaced.

On September 16, 2004, she resigned after a meeting with Koštunica. Slobodan Vuksanović replaced her in October 2004.

In June 2006 she published a book titled &quot;Put&quot; (&quot;Path&quot;), staunchly defending her actions as a minister of education. During the official promotion of her book, she claimed that during her tenure, when she asked foreign advisors why they pushed so hard for the reform of Serbian education, she was told that &quot;they need plumbers, not educated people&quot;.

In an interview in November 2019, professor Milan M. Ćirković discussed pseudoscience. He mentioned Čolić&#x27;s short ministerial stint, adding that because of her removal of Darwinism, she was &quot;depicted as a heroine in the magazines and books of the global creationist movement&quot;. Čolić responded with a letter, underlining Ćirković&#x27;s claim that some pseudoscience are life threatening, though he specifically used it for other movements like pseudo-medicine, quackery and antivaxers. Čolić wrote: &quot;difference between us - adherents of the &quot;life threatening pseudoscience&quot;, and them - serious scientists, is that we accept that incomprehensible is indeed incomprehensible, unlike them who claim that incomprehensible is comprehensible. They unlimitedly believe in limited science, and we believe in super-science - impervious to the limited human mind. As for the two 8th grade biology lessons in elementary school which I &quot;plucked&quot; from Darwin&#x27;s ape, I added them to the previous lesson: Family and health - healthy family. Role of the family. Delinquency. Restraining and treatment of addiction illnesses.&quot;

<text>Aleksandar Popović (, , born 20 October 1971) is a Serbian politician and university professor. He served as the Minister of Energy and Mining from 2007 to 2008, and as the Minister of Science and Environmental Protection from 2004 to 2007. Before becoming a politician, Popović was a sprinter who competed internationally throughout 1990s.

==Education==
Internationally educated, Popović completed elementary school in Belgrade before moving to Moscow where he finished high school. Returning home to complete college, he obtained a degree from University of Belgrade&#x27;s Faculty of Chemistry. During the mid-1990s he moved abroad again, this time to Tallahassee, in Florida, United States, where in 1996 he earned his MA from Florida State University. Finally in 2002, he added a PhD to his academic resume from Faculty of Chemistry in Belgrade, where he currently works as a full professor.

==Athletic career==
Popović made his international debut at the 1990 World Junior Championships in Athletics, where he ran in Heat 6 of the men&#x27;s 100 meters as well as in Heat 5 of the men&#x27;s 200 meters. In neither distance did he make it into the semifinals. When he moved to Moscow, he continued training with Dynamo Sports Club. When he studied for his master&#x27;s degree at Florida State, he trained with the varsity team but was not NCAA eligible, so he ran unattached at college track meets. Upon returning to Yugoslavia from his graduate studies in the United States, he was called up as a member of Yugoslavia&#x27;s 4 × 400 metres relay team for the 1997 Mediterranean Games, which placed last at the competition. His competitive sprinting career ended in 1999 with a meniscus injury. His personal record in the 200 meters was 21.73 seconds with no wind aid.

==Political career==
Popović was the Vice-president of Democratic Party of Serbia between 2003 and 2016.
He served as the Minister of Energy and Mining and previously Minister of Science and Environmental Protection in both Koštunica&#x27;s Governments between 2004 and 2008.
He was DSS candidate for the Belgrade City Mayor position in both 2008 Serbian local elections and 2012 Serbian local elections. He was nominated as Democratic Party of Serbia&#x27;s candidate in the 2017 Serbian presidential election.

==Political positions==
===Economic policy===
During a 2017 presidential campaign stop in Niš, Popović called for reducing the value-added tax rates on all domestic production in underdeveloped parts of Serbia. He also called for a progressive tax regarding those with higher incomes, however unlike the typical progressive tax model, Popović told his campaign audience in Sremska Mitrovica that the poorest should not pay taxes at all.

Without mentioning his name, Popović said that Minister of Finance Dušan Vujović is &quot;an excellent professional&quot;, but criticized him on the deadlines given to Serbian MPs on assessing budget proposals. Popović claimed that such deadlines were meant to satisfy the conveniences of the IMF as opposed to the interests of Serbia.

===Foreign policy===
====European Union====
Popović is a long-time eurosceptic. In an interview with &quot;Večernje novosti&quot; on January 24, 2017, Popović stated that he was against the Brussels Agreement. He suggested that even the termination of the Brussels Agreement should not mean an end to diplomatic relations with the European Union, but that Serbia in that case should still abstain from EU membership. During a visit in Smederevo during his presidential campaign, Popović told the press that the European Union would try to prevent Chinese investments into the Serbian metallurgical industry.

<doc id="617891" wikidata="Q367272" url="?curid=617891" title="Montreal Forum">
<text>Montreal Forum () is a historic building located facing Cabot Square in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Called &quot;the most storied building in hockey history&quot; by &quot;Sporting News&quot;, it was an indoor arena which served as the home of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Montreal Maroons from 1924 to 1938 and the Montreal Canadiens from 1926 to 1996. The Forum was built by the Canadian Arena Company in 159 days. Today most of the Forum building is now a multiplex cinema known as &quot;Cineplex Cinemas Forum&quot; operated by Cineplex Entertainment. Additionally, a large portion of the building&#x27;s upper floors are used as campus expansion for Dawson College.

Located at the northeast corner of Atwater and Ste-Catherine West (Metro Atwater), the building was historically significant as 15 Stanley Cup championships were clinched/presented on its ice: twelve for the Canadiens and one for the Maroons (for whom the arena was built initially); one for the visiting New York Rangers and Calgary Flames respectively. The Forum was also home to the Montreal Roadrunners and Montreal Junior Canadiens.

==History==

The idea to build the Forum in 1923 is credited to Sir Edward Wentworth Beatty, president of the Canadian Pacific Railway. At the suggestion of Senator Donat Raymond, William Northey developed a plan for a 12,500-seat capacity rink. Plans were scaled back for financial reasons to a rink of 9,300 seats. Even at the reduced size, the rink could not immediately find financing. The Forum would eventually be financed by H. L. Timmins. The site selected was the site of a roller skating rink named the Forum, and the name was kept. The site had previously been the site of an outdoor ice hockey rink, used by Frank and Lester Patrick, Art Ross and Russell Bowie as youths.

The Forum opened on November 29, 1924, at a total cost of 1.5 million ($ in dollars) with an original seating capacity of 9,300. It underwent two renovations, in 1949 and 1968. When the Forum closed in 1996 it had a capacity of 17,959, which included approximately 1,600 in standing room.

As part of the 1968 renovations, a centre-hanging digital score clock was installed, designed by the Day Sign Company of Toronto and similar to those installed at the Boston Garden and Chicago Stadium during the 1970s. A new centre-hanging score clock, designed by Daktronics, was installed in 1985 and contained on each side a colour matrix board.

Along with one other Original Six indoor ice hockey arena, the Boston Garden, the Montreal Forum used a high-pitched siren to signal the end of an NHL game&#x27;s period. The siren would later be re-installed in the Forum&#x27;s successor facility, the Bell Centre (and is still in use there), much as the TD Garden in Boston inherited the lower-pitched Garden&#x27;s siren.

===Ice hockey===

While hosting the Canadiens and Maroons on Thursdays and Saturdays, the Forum also hosted the Quebec Senior Hockey League, featuring the Montreal Victorias, Montreal Royals and the Montreal Canadiens amateur team on Wednesdays and Sundays. The Quebec Junior Hockey League played on Monday nights, the Bank League on Tuesdays, and the Railways and Telephone League played on Friday nights.

The Montreal Forum hosted Memorial Cup games in 1950, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1973 &amp; 1976, with the Junior Canadiens winning on home ice in 1970. In 1972, the Forum hosted game one of the famous &quot;Summit Series&quot; between Team Canada and the USSR; the USSR won the game 7-3. The 1980 NHL Entry Draft was hosted at the Forum. It would mark the first time that an NHL Arena hosted the event.

The Forum hosted the Stanley Cup Finals in 1926, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1944, 1946, 1947, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1971, 1973, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1986, 1989, and 1993.

Only two visiting teams have ever won the Stanley Cup on Forum ice: the New York Rangers did so in 1928, defeating the Maroons, while the Calgary Flames defeated the Canadiens in 1989.

On March 11, 1996, the Montreal Canadiens played their last game at the Montreal Forum, defeating the Dallas Stars 4-1. The game was televised on TSN and TQS in Canada and on ESPN2 in the United States. The Stars&#x27; Guy Carbonneau, who had captained the Canadiens from 1989 to 1994 (including their 1993 Cup win), took the ceremonial opening faceoff. After the game, many previous hockey greats were presented to the crowd, most notably Maurice Richard (said to be the Canadiens&#x27; most beloved player of all time), who received a sixteen-minute standing ovation from the crowd as he broke down in tears. A symbolic torch—representative of a line quoted from the poem &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;, &quot;To you from failing hands we throw the torch; be yours to hold it high,&quot; displayed in the Forum&#x27;s home dressing room—was carried by Émile Bouchard out of the Canadiens dressing room to the playing surface. The flaming torch was passed on to each of the former Canadiens captains (Jean Beliveau, Yvan Cournoyer, Henri Richard, Serge Savard, Bob Gainey, and Carbonneau) and finally to the then-current captain Pierre Turgeon. The next day, a parade was organized in which the torch was carried down the route to the Molson Centre (which has since been renamed the Bell Centre). Their first game at the new venue was against the New York Rangers, which the Canadiens won.

===Other sports===
When the 1932 World Figure Skating Championships were held in Montreal, the first occasion of their taking place in Canada, the Forum was used as the venue for the free skating competitions.

The Forum also hosted other sports, including indoor soccer, boxing, lacrosse and tennis. It was a site of five events in the 1976 Summer Olympics: gymnastics, handball (final), basketball (final), volleyball (final), and boxing (final). The gymnastics event included Nadia Comaneci&#x27;s famous perfect 10, the first in Olympic history.

The Forum was the site of many major professional wrestling matches, as shown in the 1961 National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;Wrestling&quot; (&quot;La Lutte&quot;).

===Notable events===

On March 11, 1937, the Forum hosted the only funeral in its history, a service for Canadiens great Howie Morenz. Morenz had died from complications due to a broken leg sustained in a game between the Canadiens and the Chicago Blackhawks on January 28.

On September 8, 1964, The Beatles performed at the Forum. Four tracks, including a live version of &quot;A Hard Rain&#x27;s a-Gonna Fall&quot; for &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue&quot; were recorded here. Bob Marley and the Wailers played here on June 10, 1978, to support his Kaya Tour. The Bee Gees played two sold-out concerts here on September 1–2, 1979, during their North American Spirits Having Flown Tour. The first four tracks off the Journey live album &quot;Captured&quot; were recorded at The Forum on August 8, 1980. In 1981, Canadian rock band Rush filmed (and recorded almost all of) their 1981 concert film and album, &quot;Exit...Stage Left&quot;. That same year, British rock band Queen recorded and filmed their concert film, titled &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; (re-released as &quot;Queen Rock Montreal&quot; in 2007), by performing the final two concerts of The Game Tour there. This had followed earlier performances by the band in 1977 for the A Day At The Races Tour, 1978 for the Jazz Tour, 1980 for the first leg of The Game Tour, and finally in 1982 for the Hot Space Tour. On August 4, 1981, the Jacksons performed at the Forum during their Triumph Tour. In March 1983, American musical duo Hall &amp; Oates filmed and recorded their concert film, Rock &#x27;n Soul Live. The live portions of Black Sabbath&#x27;s video for the song &quot;Zero the Hero&quot; were filmed in 1983. July 7–8 Madonna with her Who&#x27;s That Girl World Tour for two sold-out concerts. In July 1983, David Bowie held a concert for his Serious Moonlight Tour to promote his new album &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot;. As part of her debut headlining tour, &quot;The Greatest Love World Tour&quot;, Whitney Houston performed a concert on August 6, 1986.

The heavy metal band Metallica performed two half-priced shows at the Montreal Forum in February 1993 after the events of August 1992.

Billy Graham held his Mission Quebec in 1990 before nearly 20,000 spectators, which was filmed for international television syndication as a TV special. Then Canadien Ryan Walter delivered his testimony at the crusade.

After the Canadiens left the Forum, the building was used to film arena sequences for the Brian De Palma film &quot;Snake Eyes&quot;.

The Forum was then completely gutted and converted into a downtown entertainment centre called the Pepsi Forum, consisting of an AMC Theatres multiplex theatre (sold to Cineplex Odeon in July 2012), shops and restaurants. A Rainforest Cafe was planned to open at the location following its conversion but was never built.

Centre ice was recreated in the centre of the complex, complete with a small section of the grandstand, along with a statue of a fan leaning forward in delight (removed in the summer of 2017), while original seats were used as benches throughout the complex. A statue of Maurice Richard was located next to the grandstand. On the Saint Catherine Street entrance, there is a Quebec Walk of Fame consisting of Richard and Celine Dion. Both were on hand for their bronze star&#x27;s respective unveiling. The Atwater Street entrance has a large bronze Montreal Canadiens logo surrounded by 24 bronze Stanley Cup banners cemented into the sidewalk. Inscribed in French are the words &quot;forever proud.&quot; The entire building was themed after the Forum&#x27;s storied history, with particular emphasis on the Montreal Canadiens.

The building was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1997 because: 

The city of Montreal estimated the value of the building at $36.8 million in 2012. This is a $10 million drop in value since the previous estimation in 2009. AMC Forum is now owned by New York City-based real estate investor Ben Ashkenazy through a firm called Investissements Forum Canadien Inc. Due economic downturn in recent years, the Montreal Forum has suffered from many vacant and empty spaces. To supplement the building&#x27;s revenue, Dawson College has leased out a large section of its 2nd and 4th floors to expand its adjustment campus. Furthermore, extensive renovations were done to refresh the space to give it a more generic mall look, which meant the removal of tributes to hockey and its themes (including the re-creation of centre ice, stands, seating, hockey banners and statues). Some of the Forum and hockey memorabilia can still be found on the upper levels, albeit in a far less prominent and visible way.

<text>Terrace Hill, also known as Hubbell Mansion, Benjamin F. Allen House or the Iowa Governor&#x27;s Mansion, is the official residence of the governor of Iowa, United States. Located at 2300 Grand Avenue in Des Moines, it is an example of Second Empire architecture. The home measures 18,000 square feet (1,600 m2). It sits on a hill overlooking downtown Des Moines, and has a tower that offers a commanding view of the city. The building&#x27;s steeply pitched mansard roof, open verandas, long and narrow and frequently paired windows, and bracketed eaves give this house an irreplaceable design. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2003.

== History ==
Terrace Hill was built by Benjamin Franklin Allen, the first millionaire in Iowa, as a home for his family. The architect for this project was William Boyington, a popular Chicago architect. Construction began in 1866, and was finished in 1869. The total cost of the project was $250,000 for the Mansion, the Carriage House, the original furnishings, and about 30 acres (120,000 m2) of land. The house had very modern features for its time, which included hot and cold running water, indoor restrooms, an elevator, and gas lights.

When the house was first built, it was on the western edge of Des Moines. However, the city expanded westward. As a result, Terrace Hill is now nearly in the center of the city.

In 1884 the mansion was bought by local Des Moines businessman F.M. Hubbell. The mansion was purchased for $60,000 from Benjamin Franklin Allen.

From the time Iowa became a state in 1846 until 1947, no official residence was provided for the governor aside from Governor William L. Harding (1917–1921). In 1947 Iowa purchased an old colonial style home to serve as the residence for the governor, but by 1970, a new home was needed to serve the needs of the governor and the state to host visiting dignitaries. At first, the Iowa government considered building a new home to serve as the governor&#x27;s residence. The Hubbell family—the owners of Terrace Hill—then offered the home to the state for use as a residence for the governor and his family. In the fall of 1976, Robert D. Ray became the first governor to use Terrace Hill as his residence when he moved there with his wife Billie Ray and their three daughters. Governors Terry Branstad (1983–1999, 2011–2017), Tom Vilsack (1999–2007), Chet Culver (2007–2011), and Kim Reynolds (2017–present) have occupied Terrace Hill since then.

Terrace Hill is located at 2300 Grand Avenue, south of Interstate 235. Most visitors stop first at the Carriage House, which is located near the house. Nowadays the building is used as a reception area for most visitors who arrive to tour the home. It also contains permanent and unique changing exhibits – such as a permanent display on the previous owners of the house, the Hubbell family.

=== The First Floor ===
The first floor of Terrace Hill is a formal area. The rooms on the first floor were used often for reception of important guests, a tradition which continues.

The Vestibule is the entry area to the mansion. Formerly, a servant would greet guests in the Vestibule. They would enter through two sets of doors there that weigh more than 200 pounds (90 kg) each.

From there, guests would be taken to the Reception Room. Guests would wait while their presence was announced to the owners, and the host or hostess would greet them in that room.

Across the hall is the Drawing Room. At one time it was used for weddings and funerals of the home&#x27;s residents. Now the room is used for important events – which include entertaining of foreign dignitaries. The room also features a 7.5 foot (2.3 m) crystal chandelier, and handcarved, laminated, rosewood Belter furniture.

The Music Room was previously an entertainment room. Young women would usually play music in this room. The room features a Steinway &quot;Music Room Grand&quot; from 1869 – the same year the house was completed.

The Dining Room was used for formal dinners by the previous owners of the home. Today the Dining Room continues to be used for state dinners and receptions. Food served in the dining room is prepared in the kitchen in the basement.

The Library was another important room on the first floor. It served originally as the gathering place for the men of the home, and as a storage place for knowledge. The room contains several interesting items, which include F. M. Hubbell&#x27;s leather chair. Because he was just over 5 feet (1.5 m) tall, the chair sits close to the floor to accommodate him. There is also a portable gentleman&#x27;s &quot;desk&quot;, and a partners&#x27; table, where two people could work at once.

The Sitting Room was the family room during earlier times.

All of these rooms are connected by the Main Hall. The ceilings in the hall are 14.5 feet (4.4 m) tall. The Main Hall has carpets by Wilton. There are also a number of interesting portraits.

Outside there is a large porch that overlooks the downtown area. It is still used occasionally for parties.

=== The Second Floor ===
At the end of the Main Hall on the First Floor, there is a grand staircase that leads up to the Second Floor, with a landing in between.
At the landing between the First and Second Floors, there is a stained glass window. The window is often described as &quot;garden in glass&quot; and measures 9 by 13 feet (3 by 4 m). This window colors the landing and part of the staircase with colorful light. The window was added by F. M. Hubbell between 1884 and 1890.

After the landing, the staircase divides into two approaches to the Second Floor. Originally the Second Floor served as the bedrooms for most of the family. Now, the formal office of the governor is located on the Second Floor (their working office is located at the Capitol).

The First Gentleman&#x27;s office is also located on the Second Floor. Their office is not normally part of tours because the office is used as a working office for writing speeches, scheduling appearances, and planning special events.

=== The Third Floor and the Basement ===
The Governor of Iowa and the First Family live in the private apartment on the third floor of the house. This floor is not open to tours.

The Basement, like the Third Floor, is also not open to the public. A kitchen located in the basement prepares meals for special events. Also located in the basement is an Iowa State Patrol security office where an unspecified number of troopers assigned to the premises provide 24/7 protection to the governor of Iowa and Terrace Hill property.

== Tour information ==
Terrace Hill is open for guided tours Tuesdays through Saturdays at 10:30 am and 12:00 pm by reservation made 48 hours in advance. Terrace Hill&#x27;s touring season is March through December.

<text>In Case You Didn&#x27;t Feel Like Showing Up is a live album by American industrial metal band Ministry, released on September 4, 1990, by Sire Records.

==Critical reception and legacy==
Audio from the live performance of &quot;Breathe&quot;, subtitled &quot;Live from Gulag&quot;, was featured in Warner Bros. Records&#x27; 1990 compilation album &quot;Just Say Da&quot;, volume four of the &quot;Just Say Yes&quot; series.

In 2005, &quot;In Case You Didn&#x27;t Feel Like Showing Up&quot; was ranked number 328 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Track listing==
==&quot;Live Necronomicon&quot;==
This 2017 re-release features more songs including covers from side-projects &amp; bands like Lard, a Jourgensen and Barker side project featuring Jello Biafra, and Skinny Puppy with their frontman Nivek Ogre on vocals. In addition, the songs that had already appeared on &quot;In Case You Didn&#x27;t Feel Like Showing Up&quot; (e.g. The Missing) are presented raw and without any of the overdubbing present on the initial release.

===Disc 1===
===Disc 2===
==Video==
A companion home video also exists, featuring the same tracks as the audio except it is bookended by two &quot;bonus&quot; songs, &quot;Breathe&quot; and &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot;, and incorporates footage from two concerts, including the Merrillville, Indiana concert and a December 1989 New Year&#x27;s Eve concert in Chicago. According to Patty Marsh (Al Jourgensen&#x27;s wife in this time), the band were annoyed at having to wear exactly the same clothing on both concert dates and the video was difficult to edit properly due to small differences in each.

The beginning of the concert starts with a very textured dual drum jam then segues into &quot;Breathe&quot;. After playing &quot;Stigmata&quot;, Jello Biafra comes on stage and reads his own rendition of The Pledge of Allegiance. After that, the band returns for an encore of &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey.&quot; Biafra remains on stage giving an almost dadaist performance art routine, largely alternating between sucking his thumb and giving a Nazi salute.

<doc id="617904" wikidata="Q459991" url="?curid=617904" title="Mary Surratt">
<text>Mary Elizabeth Surratt (; 1820 or May 1823 – July 7, 1865) was an American boarding house owner in Washington, D.C., who was convicted of taking part in the conspiracy which led to the assassination of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln in 1865. Sentenced to death, she was hanged and became the first woman executed by the U.S. federal government. She maintained her innocence until her death, and the case against her was and remains controversial. Surratt was the mother of John Surratt, who was later tried in the conspiracy, but was not convicted.

Born in Maryland in the 1820s, Surratt converted to Catholicism at a young age and remained a practicing Catholic for the rest of her life. She wed John Harrison Surratt in 1840 and had three children with him. An entrepreneur, John became the owner of a tavern, an inn, and a hotel. The Surratts were sympathetic to the Confederate States of America and often hosted fellow Confederate sympathizers at their tavern.

Upon her husband&#x27;s death in 1862, Surratt had to manage his estate. Tired of doing so without help, Surratt moved to her townhouse in Washington, D.C., which she then ran as a boardinghouse. There, she was introduced to John Wilkes Booth. Booth visited the boardinghouse numerous times, as did George Atzerodt and Lewis Powell, Booth&#x27;s co-conspirators in the Lincoln assassination. Shortly before killing Lincoln, Booth spoke with Surratt and handed her a package containing binoculars for one of her tenants, John M. Lloyd.

After Lincoln was assassinated, Surratt was arrested, then tried by a military tribunal the following month, along with the other conspirators. She was convicted primarily due to the testimonies of Lloyd, who said that she told him to have the &quot;shooting irons&quot; ready, and Louis J. Weichmann, who testified about Surratt&#x27;s relationships with Booth. Five of the nine judges at her trial asked that Surratt be granted clemency by President Andrew Johnson because of her age and sex. Johnson did not grant her clemency, though accounts differ as to whether or not he received the clemency request. Surratt was hanged on July 7, 1865, and later buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery.

==Early life==
Mary Elizabeth Jenkins (baptismal name, Maria Eugenia) was born to Archibald and Elizabeth Anne (née Webster) Jenkins on a tobacco plantation near the southern Maryland town of Waterloo (now known as Clinton). Sources differ as to whether she was born in 1820 or 1823. There is uncertainty as to the month as well, but most sources say May.

She had two brothers: John Jenkins, born in 1822, and James Jenkins, born in 1825. Her father died in the fall of 1825 when Mary was either two or five years old, and Mary&#x27;s mother then inherited their property (originally part of the His Lordship&#x27;s Kindness estate).

Although her father was a nondenominational Protestant and her mother Episcopalian, Surratt was enrolled in a private Catholic girls&#x27; boarding school, the Academy for Young Ladies in Alexandria, Virginia, on November 25, 1835. Mary&#x27;s maternal aunt, Sarah Latham Webster, was a Catholic, which may have influenced where she was sent to school. Within two years, Mary converted to Catholicism and adopted the baptismal name of Maria Eugenia. She stayed at the Academy for Young Ladies for four years, leaving in 1839, when the school closed. She remained an observant Catholic for the rest of her life.

==Married life==
Mary Jenkins met John Harrison Surratt in 1839, when she was 16 or 19 and he was 26. His family had settled in Maryland in the late 1600s. An orphan, he was adopted by Richard and Sarah Neale of Washington, D.C., a wealthy couple who owned a farm. The Neales divided their farm among their children, and Surratt inherited a portion of it. His background has been described by historian Kate Clifford Larson as &quot;questionable&quot;, and he had fathered at least one child out of wedlock. They wed in August 1840. John converted to Catholicism prior to the marriage, and the couple may have wed at a Catholic church in Washington, D.C. John purchased a mill in Oxon Hill, Maryland, and the couple moved there. The Surratts had three children over the next few years: Isaac (born June 2, 1841), Elizabeth Susanna (nicknamed &quot;Anna&quot;, born January 1, 1843), and John Jr. (born April 1844).

In 1843, John Surratt purchased from his adoptive father of land straddling the DC/Maryland border, a parcel named &quot;Foxhall&quot; (approximately the area between Wheeler Road and Owens Road today). Richard Neale died in September 1843, and a month later, John purchased of land adjoining Foxhall. John and Mary Surratt and their children moved back to John&#x27;s childhood home in the District of Columbia in 1845 to help John&#x27;s mother run the Neale farm. But Sarah Neale fell ill and died in August 1845, having shortly before her death deeded the remainder of the Neale farm to John. Mary Surratt became involved in raising funds to build St. Ignatius Church in Oxon Hill (it was constructed in 1850), but John was increasingly unhappy with his wife&#x27;s religious activities. His behavior deteriorated over the next few years. John drank heavily, often failed to pay his debts, and his temper was increasingly volatile and violent.

In 1851, the Neale farmhouse burned to the ground (an escaped family slave was suspected of setting the blaze). John found work on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad. Mary moved with her children into the home of her cousin, Thomas Jenkins, in nearby Clinton. Within a year, John purchased of farmland near what is now Clinton, and by 1853, he constructed a tavern and an inn there. Mary initially refused to move herself and the children into the new residence. She took up residence on the old Neale farm, but John sold both the Neale farm and Foxhall in May 1853 to pay debts and she was forced to move back in with him in December.

With the money he earned from the tavern and sale of his other property, on December 6, 1853, John Surratt bought a townhouse at 541 H Street ( Now known as 604 H St. 2024) in Washington, D.C., and began renting it out to tenants. In 1854, John built a hotel as an addition to his tavern and called it Surratt&#x27;s Hotel.
The area around the tavern was officially named Surrattsville that same year. Travelers could take Branch Road (now Branch Avenue) north into Washington, D.C.; Piscataway Road southwest to Piscataway; or Woodyard Road northeast to Upper Marlboro. Although Surrattsville was a well-known crossroads, the community did not amount to much: just the tavern, a post office (inside the tavern), a forge, and a dozen or so houses (some of them log cabins). John Surratt was the hamlet&#x27;s first postmaster.

He expanded his family&#x27;s holdings by selling off land, paying down debt, and starting new businesses. Over the next few years, Surratt acquired or built a carriage house, corn crib, general store, forge, granary, gristmill, stable, tobacco curing house, and wheelwright&#x27;s shop. The family had enough money to send all three children to nearby Catholic boarding schools. Isaac and John Jr. attended the school at St. Thomas Manor, and Anna enrolled at the Academy for Young Ladies (Mary&#x27;s alma mater). The family&#x27;s debts continued to mount, however, and John Sr.&#x27;s drinking worsened. John sold another of land in 1856 to pay debts. By 1857, Surratt had sold all but of the family&#x27;s formerly extensive holdings (which represented about half the he had originally owned). Most of the family&#x27;s slaves were also sold to pay debts. Still, his alcoholism worsened. In 1858, Mary wrote a letter to her local priest, telling him that Surratt was drunk every single day. In 1860, St. Thomas Manor School closed, and Isaac found work in Baltimore, Maryland. The Surratts sold off another of land, which enabled Anna to remain at the Academy for Young Ladies and for John Jr. to enroll at St. Charles College, Maryland (a Catholic seminary and boarding school in Ellicott&#x27;s Mills). The couple also borrowed money that same year against their townhouse in Washington, DC, and at some point used the property as collateral for a $1,000 loan.

==Civil War and widowhood==
The American Civil War began on April 12, 1861. The border state of Maryland remained part of the United States (&quot;the Union&quot;), but the Surratts were Confederate sympathizers, and their tavern regularly hosted fellow sympathizers. The Surratt tavern was being used as a safe house for Confederate spies, and at least one author concludes that Mary had &quot;de facto&quot; knowledge of this. Confederate scout and spy Thomas Nelson Conrad visited Surratt&#x27;s boarding house before and during the Civil War.

On March 7, 1861, three days after Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s inauguration as President of the United States, Isaac left Maryland and traveled to Texas, where he enlisted in the Confederate States Army (serving in the 33rd Cavalry, or Duff&#x27;s Partisan Rangers, 14th Cavalry Battalion). John Jr. quit his studies at St. Charles College in July 1861 and became a courier for the Confederate Secret Service, moving messages, cash, and contraband back and forth across enemy lines. The Confederate activities in and around Surrattsville drew the attention of the Union government. In late 1861, Lafayette C. Baker, a detective with the Union Intelligence Service, and 300 Union soldiers camped in Surrattsville and investigated the Surratts and others for Confederate activities. He quickly uncovered evidence of a large Confederate courier network operating in the area, but despite some arrests and warnings, the courier network remained intact.

John Surratt collapsed suddenly and died on either August 25 or August 26 in 1862 (sources differ as to the date). The cause of death was a stroke. The Surratt family affairs were in serious financial difficulties. John Jr. and Anna both left school to help their mother run the family&#x27;s remaining farmland and businesses. On September 10, 1862, John Jr. was appointed postmaster of the Surrattsville post office. Lafayette Baker swept through Surrattsville again in 1862, and several postmasters were dismissed for disloyalty, but John Jr. was not one of them. In August 1863, he sought a job in the paymaster&#x27;s department in the United States Department of War, but his application caused federal agents to be suspicious about his family&#x27;s loyalties to the Union. On November 17, 1863, he was dismissed as postmaster for disloyalty.

The loss of John Jr.&#x27;s job as postmaster caused a financial crisis for the Surratt family. When John Sr.&#x27;s estate was probated in late November 1862, the family owned only two middle-age male slaves. However, by 1863, Louis J. Weichmann, a friend of John Jr. from St. Charles College, observed that the family had six or more slaves working on the property. By 1864, Mary Surratt found that her husband&#x27;s unpaid debts and bad business deals had left her with many creditors. Several of her slaves ran away. When he was not meeting with Confederate sympathizers in the city, her son was selling vegetables to raise cash for the family. Mary was tired of running the farm, tavern, and other businesses without her son&#x27;s help. In the fall of 1864, she began considering moving to her townhouse in the city.

On October 1, 1864, she took possession of the townhouse at 604 H Street NW in Washington, D.C. The gray brick house had four stories and stood on a lot wide, deep. The first floor, which was level with the street, had two large rooms, used as the kitchen and dining room. The second floor had a front and back parlor, with the room in the rear used as Mary Surratt&#x27;s bedroom. The third floor had three rooms: two in the front and a larger one at the back. The fourth floor, which was considered an attic, had two large and one small room, occupied by a servant. Surratt began moving her belongings into the townhouse that month, and on November 1, 1864, Anna and John Jr. took up residence there. Mary Surratt herself moved into the home on December 1. That same day, she leased the tavern in Surrattsville to a former Washington, D.C., policeman and Confederate sympathizer John M. Lloyd for $500 a year. On November 30, December 8, and December 27, Mary Surratt advertised for lodgers in the &quot;Daily Evening Star&quot; newspaper. She had initially said that she wanted only lodgers who were known to her personally or were recommended by friends, but in her advertisements, she said rooms were &quot;available for 4 gentlemen.&quot;

Some scholars have raised questions about Surratt&#x27;s move into the city. Historians Kate Larson and Roy Chamlee have noted that although there is no definite proof, a case can be made that Surratt made the move into the city in furtherance of her and her son&#x27;s espionage activities. For example, Larson and Chamlee say that on September 21, 1864, John Surratt wrote to Louis J. Weichmann, observing that the family&#x27;s plans to move into the city were advancing rapidly &quot;on account of certain events having turned up,&quot; perhaps a cryptic reference to either his Confederate activities in general or the conspiracy to kidnap or kill Lincoln. Larson has observed that although the move made long-term economic sense for Surratt, it also, in the short term, would have meant moving expenses and furnishing up to 10 rooms in the townhouse, money that she did not have.

Chamlee, too, found little economic reason to move into the city and concluded that it would have been more profitable to rent the H Street boarding house entirely to lodgers. During her time in the city, Surratt tried to keep her daughter away from what she felt were negative influences. Moreover, Surratt still owed money on both the tavern and the townhouse and would take out yet another mortgage against the townhouse in January 1865.

John Jr. transferred all his title to the family property to his mother in January 1865. That act may have additional implications. A traitor&#x27;s property could be seized, and John&#x27;s spy knowledge was certainly his motivation for relinquishing his title to the houses and land. Mary may have known of his motivation as well or at least suspected. If she did, she would have possessed at least &quot;de facto&quot; knowledge of the conspiracy.

==Conspiracy==

Louis J. Weichmann moved into Surratt&#x27;s boarding house on November 1, 1864. On December 23, 1864, Samuel Mudd introduced John Surratt Jr. to John Wilkes Booth. Booth recruited John Jr. into his conspiracy to kidnap Lincoln. Confederate agents began frequenting the boarding house. Booth visited the boarding house many times over the next few months, sometimes at Mary&#x27;s request.

George Atzerodt and Lewis Powell boarded at the townhouse for short periods. Atzerodt, a friend of both John Jr. and Booth and a co-conspirator in the plot to kidnap Lincoln, visited the boarding house several times in the first two months of 1865. He stayed at the Surratt boarding house in February 1865 (for one night or several, sources differ), but he proved to be a heavy drinker, and Surratt evicted him after just a few days.

He continued to visit the townhouse frequently afterward, however. Powell posed as a Baptist preacher and stayed at the boarding house for three days in March 1865. David Herold also called at the home several times.

As part of the plot to kidnap Lincoln in March 1865, John, Atzerodt, and Herold hid two Spencer carbines, ammunition, and some other supplies at the Surratt tavern in Surrattsville. On April 11, Mary Surratt rented a carriage and drove to the Surratt tavern. She said that she made the trip to collect a debt owed her by a former neighbor. However, according to her tenant, John Lloyd, Surratt told him to get the &quot;shooting irons&quot; ready to be picked up. On April 14, Surratt said that she would once again visit the family tavern in Surrattsville to collect a debt. Shortly before she left the city, Booth visited the boarding house and spoke privately with her. He gave her a package, later found to contain binoculars, for Lloyd to pick up later that evening. Surratt did so and, according to Lloyd, again told Lloyd to have the &quot;shooting irons&quot; ready for pickup and handed him a wrapped package from Booth.

Booth&#x27;s plan was to assassinate Lincoln and have Atzerodt kill Vice President Andrew Johnson and Powell kill Secretary of State William H. Seward. Booth killed Lincoln, Atzerodt never attempted to kill Johnson, and Powell stabbed Seward repeatedly but failed to murder him. As they fled the city after Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, Booth and Herold picked up the rifles and binoculars from Surratt&#x27;s tavern. Lloyd repaired a broken spring on Surratt&#x27;s wagon before they left.

==Arrest and incarceration==
Around 2 a.m. on April 15, 1865, members of the District of Columbia police visited the Surratt boarding house, seeking John Wilkes Booth and John Surratt. Why the police came to the house is not entirely clear. Most historians conclude that Weichmann&#x27;s friend, Department of War employee Daniel Gleason, had alerted federal authorities to Confederate activity centered on the Surratt house, but that does not explain why police rather than federal agents appeared there. (Historian Roy Chamlee, however, says that there is evidence that Gleason did not tell police about his suspicions of Weichmann for several days.) Within 45 minutes of the attack on Lincoln, John Surratt&#x27;s name had become associated with the attack on Secretary of State William H. Seward. The police as well as the Provost Marshal&#x27;s office both had files on John Surratt Jr. and knew he was a close friend of Booth. (It is possible that either James L. Maddox, property supervisor at Ford&#x27;s Theatre and a friend of Booth&#x27;s, or actor John Matthews, both of whom may have known about the plot to attack government officials, mentioned Surratt&#x27;s name.) Historian Otto Eisenschiml has argued that David Herold&#x27;s attempt to steal a horse from John Fletcher may have led them to the Surratt boarding house, but at least one other scholar has called the link uncertain. Other sources claim that eyewitnesses had identified Booth as Lincoln&#x27;s attacker, and the detectives had information (a tip from an unnamed actor and a bartender) linking John Jr. to Booth. Mary lied to the detectives that her son had been in Canada for two weeks. She also did not reveal that she had delivered a package to the tavern on Booth&#x27;s behalf only hours earlier.
On April 17, a Surratt neighbor told U.S. military authorities that he overheard one of the Surratt&#x27;s servants saying that three men had come to the house on the night of Lincoln&#x27;s assassination and that one of the men had mentioned Booth in a theater. (The servant was mistaken about the date, as John Surratt Jr. had indeed been in Elmira, New York, on a mission for a Confederate general). Other pieces of information also mentioned the boarding house as a key meeting place of the possible conspirators. Either Colonel Henry H. Wells, Provost Marshal (head of the military police) of the District of Columbia, or General Christopher C. Augur told Colonel Henry Steel Olcott to arrest everyone in the house.

Federal soldiers visited the Surratt boarding house again late on the evening of April 17. John Jr. could not be found, but after a search of the house, the agents found in Mary&#x27;s room a picture of Booth, hidden behind another photograph, pictures of Confederate leaders including Jefferson Davis, a pistol, a mold for making bullets, and percussion caps. As Mary was being arrested for conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln, Powell appeared at her door in disguise. Although Surratt denied knowing him, Powell claimed that he was a laborer hired by Surratt to dig a ditch the next morning. The discrepancy and Powell&#x27;s remarkably well-dressed and -groomed appearance, quite unlike a ditch-digger, prompted his arrest. He was later identified as the man who had attempted to assassinate Secretary of State William Seward.

After her arrest, she was held at an annex to the Old Capitol Prison before being transferred to the Washington Arsenal on April 30. Two armed guards stood before the door to her cell from the beginning of her imprisonment until her death. Her cell, while airy and larger than the others, was sparsely furnished, with a straw mattress, table, wash basin, chair, and a bucket. Food was served four times a day, always of bread; salt pork, beef, or beef soup; and coffee or water. The other arrested conspirators had their heads enclosed in a padded canvas bag to prevent a suicide attempt. Sources disagree as to whether Surratt was also forced to wear it. Although the others wore iron manacles on their feet and ankles, she was not manacled. (Rumors to the contrary were raised by reporters at the trial who could not see her or &quot;heard&quot; the clank of chains about her feet. The rumors were repeatedly investigated and denied.) She began to suffer menstrual bleeding and became weak during her detention. She was given a rocking chair and allowed visits from her daughter, Anna. She and Powell received the most attention from the press. The Northern press was also highly critical of her, claiming that she had a &quot;criminal face&quot; due to her small mouth and dark eyes.

John Surratt Jr. was in Elmira at the time of the assassination, delivering messages on behalf of a Confederate general. After learning of Lincoln&#x27;s death, he fled to Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

==Trial==
The trial for the alleged conspirators began on May 9. A military tribunal, rather than a civilian court, was chosen as the venue because government officials thought that its more lenient rules of evidence would enable the court to get to the bottom of what was then perceived by the public as a vast conspiracy. All eight alleged conspirators were tried simultaneously. Historians have conflicting views regarding Surratt&#x27;s innocence. Historian Laurie Verge commented, &quot;Only in the case of Dr. Samuel Alexander Mudd is there as much controversy as to the guilt or innocence of one of the defendants.&quot; Lincoln assassination scholar Thomas Reed Turner says that of the eight people accused of plotting to kill Lincoln, the case against Surratt remains &quot;the most controversial... at that time and since.&quot;

A room on the northeast corner of the third floor of the Arsenal was made into a courtroom, and the prisoners were brought into the room through a side door, which prevented them from passing by or being harassed by spectators. Surratt was given special considerations during the trial because of her illness and sex. In the courtroom, she sat apart from the other prisoners. Sources differ as to whether an armed guard sat on either side of her, as was done for other prisoners during the trial. While the others wore wrist and ankle manacles in the courtroom, she did not. She was also permitted a bonnet, fan, and veil to hide her face from spectators. As her illness worsened during the trial, she was moved to a larger and more comfortable prison cell.

Surratt was charged with abetting, aiding, concealing, counseling, and harboring her co-defendants. The federal government initially attempted to find legal counsel for her and the others, but almost no attorneys were willing to take the job for fear they would be accused of disloyalty to the Union. Surratt retained Reverdy Johnson as her legal counsel. A member of the military commission trying the conspirators challenged Johnson&#x27;s right to defend Surratt, as he had objected to requiring loyalty oaths from voters in the 1864 presidential election. After much discussion, this objection was withdrawn, but damage had been done to his influence, and he did not attend most of the court sessions. Most of Surratt&#x27;s legal defense was presented by two other lawyers: Frederick Aiken and John Wesley Clampitt.
The prosecution&#x27;s strategy was to tie Surratt to the conspiracy. Powell&#x27;s arrival at her boarding house, three days after the president&#x27;s murder, was critical evidence against her, the government argued. The prosecution presented nine witnesses, but most of their case rested on the testimony of just two men: John M. Lloyd and Louis J. Weichmann. Lloyd testified on May 13 and 15, 1865 on the hiding of the carbines and other supplies at the tavern in March and the two conversations he had with her in which she told him to get the &quot;shooting irons&quot; ready. Weichmann&#x27;s testimony was important, as it established an intimate relationship between her and the other conspirators.

Weichmann testified May 16 to 19 and said that he had resided at the boarding house since November 1864. He had seen or overheard John Jr. meeting and talking with Atzerodt, Booth, and Powell many times over the past four and a half months. Weichmann had driven Surratt to the tavern on April 11 and 14, confirmed that she and Lloyd had spent much time in private conversation, testified that he saw Booth give her the package of binoculars, and attested that she had turned the package over to Lloyd. Weichmann also testified at length about the Surratt family&#x27;s ties to the Confederate spy and courier rings operating in the area and their relationships with Atzerodt and Powell. He also testified about the December 23 meeting with Booth and John (which he also attended) and their subsequent meeting with Booth at Booth&#x27;s room at the National Hotel. Finally, he told the military tribunal about the general excitement in the boarding house in March 1865 after the failed attempt to kidnap Lincoln.

Other prosecution witnesses reinforced Weichmann&#x27;s testimony. Lodger Honora Fitzpatrick confirmed visits by Atzerodt, Booth, and Powell to the boarding house. Emma Offut, Lloyd&#x27;s sister-in-law, testified that she saw (but did not hear) Surratt speaking for long periods of time with Lloyd on April 11 and 14. Government agents testified about their arrest of Surratt, Powell&#x27;s arrival, and her denial that she knew Powell. The fact that Powell sought refuge in the boarding house after Lincoln&#x27;s murder left a bad impression of her. Surratt&#x27;s refusal (or failure) to recognize him also weighed against her. The agents also testified about their search of the house, and the evidence (the photographs, the weapons, etc.) discovered there. Lloyd&#x27;s testimony was the most important for the prosecution&#x27;s case, for it indicated that she had played an active role in the conspiracy in the days before Lincoln&#x27;s death. The prosecution rested its case on May 22.

The defense strategy was to impeach the testimony of the key prosecution witnesses: Lloyd and Weichmann. It also wished to show that she was loyal to the Union, her trips to Surrattsville were of an innocent nature, and she had not been aware of Booth&#x27;s plans. There were 31 witnesses who testified for the defense. George H. Calvert testified that he had pressed Surratt to pay a debt, Bennett Gwynn said Surratt had sought payment from John Nothey to satisfy the Calvert debt, and Nothey agreed that he had received a letter from Surratt for him to appear at the tavern on April 11 to pay what was owed. Several witnesses impugned Lloyd&#x27;s character by testifying about his alcoholism, while others said he was too intoxicated on the day of Lincoln&#x27;s assassination to remember that day clearly. Augustus Howell, a Confederate agent, testified that Weichmann was an untrustworthy witness, as he had sought to become a Confederate spy himself. (The prosecution had attempted to show that Howell was a Confederate spy and should not be trusted.)

Anna Surratt testified that it was Weichmann who had brought Atzerodt into the boarding house, that the photograph of Booth was hers, and that she owned photographs of Union political and military leaders. Anna denied ever overhearing any discussions of disloyal activities or ideas in the boarding house, and that Booth&#x27;s visits to the house were always short. Anna explained her mother&#x27;s failure to recognize Powell by asserting she could not see well. Augusta Howell, a former servant, and Honora Fitzpatrick, a former slave, testified to Mary&#x27;s poor eyesight as well. The former servant and the former slave both said Surratt had given Union soldiers food. Numerous witnesses were called at the end of the defense&#x27;s case to testify to her loyalty to the Union, her deep Christian faith, and her kindness. During the prosecution&#x27;s rebuttal, government lawyers called four witnesses to the stand, who testified as to Weichmann&#x27;s unimpeachable character.

Johnson and Aiken presented the closing arguments for the defense. Johnson attacked the jurisdiction of a military tribunal over civilians, as had Mudd&#x27;s attorney. Aiken also challenged the court&#x27;s jurisdiction. He also reiterated that Lloyd and Weichmann were unreliable witnesses and that the evidence against her was all circumstantial. The only evidence linking Surratt to the conspiracy to kill Lincoln, he said, came from Lloyd and Weichmann, and neither man was telling the truth. (Dorothy Kunhardt has written that there is evidence the latter&#x27;s perjured testimony was suborned by Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton.)

Judge Advocate John Bingham presented the closing argument for the prosecution. The military tribunal had jurisdiction, he said, not only because the court itself had ruled at the beginning of the trials that it did but because they were crimes committed in a military zone, during a time of war, and against high government officials in carrying out treasonous activities. Bingham pointed out that the Surratt boarding house was where the conspiracy was planned, and Atzerodt, Booth, and Powell had all met with Surratt. Booth had paid for the rental of the carriage that took Surratt to Surrattsville each time, and Bingham said that was evidence that Surratt&#x27;s trips were critical to the conspiracy. Bingham also said that Lloyd&#x27;s testimony had been corroborated by others and that his unwillingness to reveal the cache of weapons in the tavern was prompted by his subservient tenant relationship to Surratt. Bingham concluded by reiterating the government&#x27;s key point: Powell had returned to the Surratt house seeking Surratt, and that alone was proof of her guilt. Bingham also pointed out for the tribunal that the charge a person was indicted for was irrelevant. Under the law of conspiracy, if one person carries out a crime, all conspirators are guilty of the same crime.

The trial ended on June 28, 1865. Surratt was so ill the last four days of the trial that she was permitted to stay in her cell. In the opinion of historian Roy Z. Chamlee, both legal teams appeared to have flaws in their cases, and except for Reverdy Johnson, neither team employed highly skilled attorneys. The government&#x27;s case was hindered by its failure to call as a witness the man who shared Lloyd&#x27;s carriage when he talked with Surratt and could have verified Lloyd&#x27;s version of the &quot;shooting irons&quot; story or Metropolitan Police Chief A.C. Richards whose investigation had had the most success in the early days of the investigation. The government did not fully investigate Booth&#x27;s meetings with Surratt at noon or the evening of the murder, and its questioning and cross-examination of witnesses was poorly prepared and weak. What is most important, according to historian Roy Z. Chamber Jr., is that the government had botched the attempt to apprehend John Jr. The defense&#x27;s case, too, had a problem. The defense never followed up on inconsistencies in Weichmann&#x27;s chronology of Mary&#x27;s last visit to the tavern, which could have undermined Weichmann&#x27;s entire credibility.
The military tribunal considered guilt and sentencing on June 29 and 30. Surratt&#x27;s guilt was the second-last to be considered, as her case had problems of evidence and witness reliability. The sentence was handed down on June 30. The military tribunal found her guilty on all charges but two. A death sentence required six of the nine votes of the judges. Surratt was sentenced to death, the first woman executed by the federal government. The sentence was announced publicly on July 5. When Powell learned of his sentence, he declared that she was completely innocent of all charges. The night before the execution, Surratt&#x27;s priests and Anna Surratt both visited Powell and elicited from him a strong statement declaring Mary innocent. Although it was delivered to Captain Christian Rath, who was overseeing the execution, Powell&#x27;s statement had no effect on anyone with authority to prevent Surratt&#x27;s death. George Atzerodt bitterly condemned her, implicating her even further in the conspiracy. Powell&#x27;s was the only statement by any conspirator exonerating Surratt.

Anna Surratt pleaded repeatedly for her mother&#x27;s life with Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt, but he refused to consider clemency. She also attempted to see President Andrew Johnson several times to beg for mercy but was not granted permission to see him.

Five of the nine judges signed a letter asking President Johnson to give Surratt clemency and commute her sentence to life in prison because of her age and sex. Holt did not deliver the recommendation to Johnson until July 5, two days before Surratt and the others were to hang. Johnson signed the order for execution but did not sign the order for clemency. Johnson later said he never saw the clemency request; Holt said he showed it to Johnson, who refused to sign it. Johnson, according to Holt, said in signing the death warrant that she had &quot;kept the nest that hatched the egg.&quot;

==Execution==
Construction of the gallows for the hanging of the conspirators condemned to death began immediately on July 5, after the execution order was signed. It was constructed in the south part of the Arsenal courtyard, was high and about in size. Rath, who oversaw the preparations for the executions, made the nooses. Tired of making nooses and thinking that the government would never hang a woman, he made Surratt&#x27;s noose the night before the execution with five loops rather than the regulation&#x27;s seven. He tested the nooses that night by tying them to a tree limb and a bag of buckshot and then tossing the bag to the ground (the ropes held). Civilian workers did not want to dig the graves out of superstitious fear, so Rath asked for volunteers among the soldiers at the Arsenal and received more help than he needed.

At noon on July 6, Surratt was informed she would be hanged the next day. She wept profusely. She was joined by two Catholic priests (Jacob Walter and B.F. Wiget) and her daughter Anna. Father Jacob remained with her almost until her death. Her menstrual problems had worsened, and she was in such pain and suffered from such severe cramps that the prison doctor gave her wine and medication. She repeatedly asserted her innocence. She spent the night on her mattress, weeping and moaning in pain and grief, ministered to by the priests. Anna left her mother&#x27;s side at 8 a.m. on July 7 and went to the White House to beg for her mother&#x27;s life one last time. Her entreaty rejected, she returned to the prison and her mother&#x27;s cell at about 11 a.m. The soldiers began testing the gallows about 11:25 a.m.; the sound of the tests unnerved all the prisoners. Shortly before noon, Mary Surratt was taken from her cell and then allowed to sit in a chair near the entrance to the courtyard. The heat in the city that day was oppressive. By noon, it had already reached . The guards ordered all visitors to leave at 12:30 p.m. When she was forced to part from her mother, Anna&#x27;s hysterical screams of grief could be heard throughout the prison.

Clampitt and Aiken had not finished trying to save their client, however. On the morning of July 7, they asked a District of Columbia court for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, arguing that the military tribunal had no jurisdiction over their client. The court issued the writ at 3 a.m., and it was served on General Winfield Scott Hancock. Hancock was ordered to produce Surratt by 10 a.m. General Hancock sent an aide to General John F. Hartranft, who commanded the Old Capitol Prison, ordering him not to admit any US marshal, as that would prevent the marshal from serving a similar writ on Hartranft. Johnson was informed that the court had issued the writ and promptly cancelled it at 11:30 a.m. under the authority granted to him by the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act of 1863. General Hancock and United States Attorney General James Speed personally appeared in court and informed the judge of the cancellation of the writ.
On July 7, 1865, at 1:15 p.m., a procession led by General Hartranft escorted the four condemned prisoners through the courtyard and up the steps to the gallows. Each prisoner&#x27;s ankles and wrists were bound by manacles. Surratt led the way, wearing a black bombazine dress, black bonnet, and black veil. More than 1,000 people, including government officials, members of the US armed forces, friends and family of the accused, official witnesses, and reporters, watched. General Hancock limited attendance to those who had a ticket, and only those who had a good reason to be present were given a ticket. (Most of those present were military officers and soldiers, as fewer than 200 tickets had been printed.)

Alexander Gardner, who had photographed the body of Booth and taken portraits of several of the male conspirators while they were imprisoned aboard naval ships, photographed the execution for the government. Hartranft read the order for their execution. Surratt, either weak from her illness or swooning in fear (perhaps both), had to be supported by two soldiers and her priests. The condemned were seated in chairs, Surratt almost collapsing into hers. She was seated to the right of the others, the traditional &quot;seat of honor&quot; in an execution. White cloth was used to bind their arms to their sides and their ankles and thighs together. The cloths around Surratt&#x27;s legs were tied around her dress below the knees. Each person was ministered to by a member of the clergy. From the scaffold, Powell said, &quot;Mrs. Surratt is innocent. She doesn&#x27;t deserve to die with the rest of us.&quot; Fathers Jacob and Wiget prayed over her and held a crucifix to her lips. About 16 minutes elapsed from the time the prisoners entered the courtyard until they were ready for execution.

Surratt&#x27;s bonnet was removed, and the noose put around her neck by a U.S. Secret Service officer. A white bag was placed over the head of each prisoner after the noose was put in place. She complained that the bindings about her arms hurt, and the officer preparing said, &quot;Well, it won&#x27;t hurt long.&quot; Finally, the prisoners were asked to stand and move forward a few feet to the nooses. The chairs were removed. Her last words, spoken to a guard as he moved her forward to the drop, were &quot;Please don&#x27;t let me fall.&quot;

Surratt and the others stood on the drop for about 10 seconds, and then Captain Rath clapped his hands. Four soldiers of Company F of the 14th Veteran Reserves knocked out the supports holding the drops in place, and the condemned fell. Surratt, who had moved forward enough to barely step onto the drop, lurched forward and slid partway down the drop, her body snapping tight at the end of the rope, swinging back and forth. She appeared to die relatively quickly with little struggle. Atzerodt&#x27;s stomach heaved once and his legs quivered; then, he was still. Herold and Powell struggled for nearly five minutes, strangling to death.

==Burial==

Each body was inspected by a physician to ensure that death had occurred. The bodies of the executed were allowed to hang for about 30 minutes and soldiers began to cut them down at 1:53 p.m. A corporal raced to the top of the gallows and cut down Atzerodt&#x27;s body, which fell to the ground with a thud. He was reprimanded, and the other bodies were cut down more gently. Herold&#x27;s body was next, followed by Powell&#x27;s. Surratt&#x27;s body was cut down at 1:58 p.m. As Surratt&#x27;s body was cut loose, her head fell forward. A soldier joked, &quot;She makes a good bow&quot; and was rebuked by an officer for his poor use of humor.

Upon examination, the military surgeons determined that no one&#x27;s neck had been broken by the fall. The manacles and cloth bindings were removed but not the white execution masks, and the bodies were placed into the pine coffins. The name of each person was written on a piece of paper by acting Assistant Adjutant R. A. Watts, and inserted in a glass vial, which was placed into the coffin. The coffins were buried against the prison wall in shallow graves, just a few feet from the gallows. A white picket fence marked the burial site. The night that she died, a mob attacked the Surratt boarding house and began stripping it of souvenirs until the police stopped them.

Anna Surratt unsuccessfully asked for her mother&#x27;s body for four years. In 1867, the War Department decided to tear down the portion of the Washington Arsenal where the bodies of Surratt and the other executed conspirators lay. On October 1, 1867, the coffins were disinterred and reburied in Warehouse No. 1 at the Arsenal, with a wooden marker placed at the head of each burial vault. Booth&#x27;s body lay alongside them. In February 1869, Edwin Booth asked Johnson for the body of his brother. Johnson agreed to turn the body over to the Booth family, and on February 8 Surratt&#x27;s body was turned over to the Surratt family. She was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Washington, D.C., on February 9, 1869. Lloyd is buried from her grave in the same cemetery.

==Surviving family and home==

Anna Surratt moved from the townhouse on H Street and lived with friends for a few years, ostracized from society. She married William Tonry, a government clerk. They lived in poverty for a while after he was dismissed from his job, but in time, he became a professor of chemistry in Baltimore and the couple became better off. The strain of her mother&#x27;s death left Anna mentally unbalanced, and she suffered from periods of extreme fear that bordered on insanity. She died in 1904.

After the dismissal of charges against him, John Jr. married and he and his family lived in Baltimore near his sister, Anna. He had seven children, the only one of Mary&#x27;s children with issue.

Isaac Surratt also returned to the United States and lived in Baltimore. He died unmarried in 1907. Isaac and Anna were buried on either side of their mother in Mount Olivet Cemetery. John Jr. was buried in Baltimore in 1916. In 1968, a new headstone with a brass plaque replaced the old, defaced headstone over Mary Surratt&#x27;s grave.

Mary Surratt&#x27;s boarding house still stands and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Those interested in Mary Surratt formed the Surratt Society. The Surrattsville tavern and house are historical sites run today by the Surratt Society as a historic house museum. The Washington Arsenal is now Fort Lesley J. McNair.

==Portrayals==
Surratt was portrayed by actress Virginia Gregg in the 1956 episode &quot;The Mary Surratt Case,&quot; telecast as part of the NBC anthology series &quot;The Joseph Cotten Show&quot;. She was portrayed by Robin Wright in the 2011 film &quot;The Conspirator&quot;, which was directed by Robert Redford. She was portrayed by Carrie Lazar in the 2024 television series &quot;Manhunt&quot; by showrunner Monica Beletsky.
