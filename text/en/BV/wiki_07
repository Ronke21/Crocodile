<text>Wannsee () is a locality in the southwestern Berlin borough of Steglitz-Zehlendorf, Germany. It is the westernmost locality of Berlin. In the quarter there are two lakes, the larger &quot;Großer Wannsee&quot; (Greater Wannsee, &quot;See&quot; means lake) and the &quot;Kleiner Wannsee&quot; (Little Wannsee), located on the River Havel and separated only by the Wannsee Bridge. The larger of the two lakes covers an area of and has a maximum depth of .

The municipality is the location of the compound where the mass-extermination of Europe&#x27;s Jewish population, known as the &quot;Final Solution&quot;, was planned and approved in early 1942 by the Nazi Party&#x27;s highest ranking officials, including Reinhard Heydrich and Adolf Eichmann.

==Geography==
===Overview===
At the western rim of the Wannsee locality the Glienicke Bridge connects it with the city of Potsdam. The late neoclassical Glienicke Palace as well as the Pfaueninsel are nearby. Since 1990 these palaces and parks have formed part of the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The locality is centred on the ancient village of Stolpe, known to exist in 1299. The locality also includes the districts of Kohlhasenbrück (named after the 1811 novella &quot;Michael Kohlhaas&quot; by Heinrich von Kleist) and Steinstücken, which in Cold War days became famous as a tiny exclave of West Berlin within the GDR.

===Großer and Kleiner Wannsee===
Wannsee lake is a bathing and recreation spot for western Berlin. The Strandbad Wannsee, an open-air lido with one of the longest inland beaches in Europe and a nudist area, was built in 1929–1930 after a concept by architect Richard Ermisch. Situated on the eastern shore of the lake it is officially part of the Nikolassee locality.

==History==

The history of Wannsee as an attractive suburb of Berlin began when &quot;Great Elector&quot; Frederick William of Brandenburg ordered the construction of a hunting lodge, the Jagdschloss Glienicke. The castle remained the hunting lodge of the Hohenzollern family for generations, and was rebuilt and expanded several times. Today, the castle houses an institute for social education.

In 1793, the Prussian king Frederick William II, a descendant of Frederick William, acquired the island Pfaueninsel (German: &quot;Peacock Island&quot;) in the Havel river and had the Pfaueninsel castle built for himself and his mistress Wilhelmine Enke in 1794–1797. Jagdschloss Glienicke and Pfaueninsel castle are both part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.

On 21 November 1811, German writer Heinrich von Kleist shot himself on the shore of the &quot;Kleiner Wannsee&quot; and, at her bidding, his lover, Henriette Vogel. A memorial marks the site.

Glienicke Palace (German: &quot;Schloss Glienicke&quot;) was designed in neoclassical style by Karl Friedrich Schinkel for Prince Carl of Prussia in 1826. It used to be the summer palace of the prince. Together with the Russian style ensemble &quot;Nikolskoe&quot; around the church Ss. Peter and Paul (German: St. Peter und Paul) on the top of a hill on the banks of the Havel river, it also belongs to the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.

&quot;Nikolskoe,&quot; consisting of the church, a cottage, a school and a cemetery, was established from 1813 to 1837 at the suggestion by a Russian Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, the daughter of King Frederick William III of Prussia. Her brother Prince Carl, constructor of Glienicke Palace, was buried in the church after his death. Today the church is especially popular for weddings and the cottage is housing a restaurant.

The Verein Seglerhaus am Wannsee, the second oldest yacht club in Germany, was established in October 1867 on a small wooden shack by River Havel. In 1877 it moved to its present location at the edge of the lake.

In 1909, Max Liebermann, head of the Berlin Secession, had a villa built at the western shore of the Wannsee. His widow was forced to sell it to the &quot;Deutsche Reichspost&quot; in 1940. Today, the property is a museum in honor of the painter. Especially worth seeing is the garden, which was a popular Liebermann motif.

In 1928, a large shooting range was established in the Düppel woods near the Berlin city limits. It was the site of the shooting events of the 1936 Summer Olympics. A golf course hosted the running section of the modern pentathlon at the same games. After World War II, it was used by the US Army as the &quot;Rose Range&quot; firing compound. In 1994, the shooting range was returned to Germany by the Allies, and is today used by the DEVA institute.

On 20 January 1942, senior Nazi officials met at the Wannsee Villa (built 1914–1915) to ensure the cooperation of the major government organizations in &quot;the organizational, logistical and material steps for a final solution of the Jewish question in Europe&quot; - the extermination of the Jews of Europe. The event, presided over by Reinhard Heydrich and conducted by Adolf Eichmann, has since become known as the Wannsee Conference. Today, the building serves as a memorial and education centre.

==Transport==
Wannsee is served by the Berlin S-Bahn lines S1, as terminus, and S7, at the Berlin-Wannsee railway station. It is also a stop of some long-distance trains as well as of RegionalExpress and RegionalBahn trains of Deutsche Bahn and Transdev Germany. Wannsee is also linked to Kladow by Berlin ferry line F10.

==Education==
The &quot;Japanische Internationale Schule zu Berlin&quot;, a Japanese international school, is in Wannsee.

The American Academy in Berlin is located on Lake Wannsee.

<doc id="611663" wikidata="Q6820096" url="?curid=611663" title="Merricks, Victoria">
<text>Merricks is a town in the south-eastern extremity of the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, approximately south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Merricks recorded a population of 184 at the 2021 census.

Merricks is located between Hastings and Flinders.

==History==

Merricks was part of the Parish of Balnarring and is believed to be named after an early cattle station owner. It was first settled in 1865 by John Caldwell, who built &quot;Koonoona&quot;, a wattle cottage. Unlike Balnarring and Hastings, Merricks&#x27;s early settlers preferred running cattle and sheep to growing orchards. In 1902 a post office opened which was served by Cobb and Co from Crib Point; this closed in 1979. In 1920, a co-operative cool store was built in nearby Red Hill, and from 1921 until 1953, a railway from Bittern to Red Hill travelled through Merricks, although it received little use after its initial decade of service. A small primary school was also opened in 1921, closing in 1951 along with several others in the region when Red Hill Consolidated School commenced.

The Victorian Municipal Directory in 1962 stated that Merricks contained &quot;(only) a general store and post and telegraph office&quot;.

==Present day==

Merricks is a tiny settlement along the Frankston-Flinders Road which has changed little over the years from its earlier rural functions, and many of the original settler houses still stand today. It features a newly restored General Store (built in 1927) incorporating a post office and newsagency, the Peninsula Quarter Horse Association&#x27;s base and a chocolate factory. Also in Merricks are the Merricks Creek vineyard specialising in pinot noir production and Stoniers Winery (1978) producing chardonnay and pinot noir.

A 6.3 km mostly tree-lined horse riding trail, established by the former Shire of Hastings in the mid-1980s along a disused railway route, runs roughly east–west from Merricks Station Ground Reserve to Red Hill through mostly rural land between the Coolart and East Creeks.

Merricks is served by the 782 bus route operated by Ventura Bus Lines between Frankston and Flinders.

In 1780, Joseph Damer, Lord Milton, the first Earl of Dorchester and owner of Milton Abbey, decided that the adjacent market town, Middleton, was disturbing his vision of rural peace. He commissioned architect Sir William Chambers and landscape gardener Capability Brown (both of whom had already worked on the Abbey building and grounds) to design a new village, Milton Abbas, in a wooded valley (Luccombe Bottom) to the southeast of the Abbey. Most of the existing villagers were relocated here, and the previous village was demolished and the site landscaped.

The 36 almost identical thatched cottages were intended to house two families each. They were built from cob and previously were painted yellow, with each house fronted by a lawn; originally a horse chestnut tree was planted between each dwelling. Almshouses and a church were also provided for the new village, sited opposite each other. The almshouses were moved from the old town, where they had originally been built in 1674. The church, consecrated in 1786, is in Georgian Gothic style, with late 19th-century additions.

Some house-names give clues to some of the original inhabitants of the village: baker, blacksmith, brewery, etc. Today the houses are white-washed, and the main street also features a public house (the &quot;Hambro Arms&quot;), a Post Office/shop, the Tea Clipper Tea Rooms, a now redundant school building, and a Wesleyan chapel. In 1953 the original horse chestnut trees were judged unsafe and a danger to the houses and removed. Above the eastern end of the valley, the village has been extended with more modern housing and other facilities, including a doctor&#x27;s surgery.

==Geography==
Measured directly, Milton Abbas village is about southwest of the market town of Blandford Forum and northeast of the county town of Dorchester. Milton Abbas civil parish extends from the village south to Bagber Farm, west to Bramblecombe Lane, north to Delcombe Head, and east to the top of Whatcombe Wood.

==Demography==
In the 2011 Census Milton Abbas civil parish had 263 dwellings, 232 households and a population of 755.

==18th-century street fair==
Every two years there is a simulation of an 18th-century country fair with traditional music and dancing and local crafts people. Residents and stall holders dress in period costume.

==Notable buildings==

Within Milton Abbas civil parish, 75 structures are listed by Historic England for their historical or architectural interest; four structures are listed as Grade I, six are Grade II* and the rest are Grade II. The Grade I structures are the Abbey Church of St Mary, St Sansom and St Bradwalader, the Chapel of St Catherine, Milton Abbey School, and The Abbot&#x27;s Hall and kitchen at Milton Abbey. The Grade II* structures are the almshouses and reading room, Delcombe Manor, Garden Cottage at Delcombe Manor, the Parish Church of St James (built circa 1786), The Old Rectory, and The Stone Lodge And Gatehouse (including the gatehouse, gatepiers and gates). In addition to the listed structures, of parkland around the abbey site are listed as Grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

The Abbey Church dates mostly from the 14th century, with a 15th-century north transept and tower extension. It was restored in 1790 by James Wyatt and in 1865 by Sir George Gilbert Scott. It is described in its listing text as &quot;a church of major importance&quot;. The Chapel of St Catherine dates from the late 12th century and originally served the abbey. It has been changed little since its construction; during the 18th century the chancel walls were raised and the nave&#x27;s west wall rebuilt, in 1901 it was restored, and about 1980 the stone slates on the north side of the roof were replaced with artificial stone. Milton Abbey School, built in 1771–1776 as a country house, was designed by Sir William Chambers and James Wyatt in the early Gothic Revival style. It largely replaced the abbey&#x27;s domestic buildings. The abbot&#x27;s hall and kitchen at Milton Abbey used to be the abbey&#x27;s hall (built 1498) and dining room (17th century); they were incorporated into the country house (now Milton Abbey School) by Chambers and restored by Sir Gilbert Scott in the mid-19th century. A fire in 1956 destroyed internal features in the kitchen.

Milton Manor, on the east side of the village, is listed as Grade II. It was originally built in the mid 19th century as a shooting lodge forming part of the Hambro Estate. It was enlarged in the early 20th century in the Arts and Crafts style.

==Education==
The original abbey and House is now Milton Abbey School, a co-educational independent school, with around 250 pupils.

<text>TV5Monde (), formerly known as TV5, is a French public television network, broadcasting several channels of French-language programming. It is an approved participant member of the European Broadcasting Union.

The network is available across Europe on satellite via Astra 19.2°E and Eutelsat Hot Bird (13°E) (both free-to-air), online and via TVPlayer.

==Summary==
TV5 started on 2 January 1984 and was under the management of Serge Adda until his death in November 2004. The next director from 6 April 2005 was Jean-Jacques Aillagon, a former French Minister for Culture and Communication. The director-general is now Marie-Christine Saragosse.

In January 2006, TV5 underwent a major overhaul, including rebranding as &quot;TV5Monde&quot; to stress its focus as a global network (&quot;Monde&quot; is French for &quot;World&quot;). Also, the changes included a new schedule and a new program line-up. Since 1993, &quot;TV5 Monde&quot; is part of the channel&#x27;s corporate name. Its Canadian operations are branded &quot;TV5 Québec Canada&quot;, but the shorter version TV5 is also used.

==History==
TV5 was formed on 2 January 1984, under the guidance of Claude Cheysson, the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, and TV5 President Serge Adda, by five public television channels: TF1, Antenne 2 and FR3 from France, the Swiss Télévision Suisse Romande and the Belgian RTBF. The &quot;5&quot; from the name TV5 comes from the five public broadcasters. On 18 December 1985, TV5 was amongst the first four channels carried by cable television in France, inaugurated in Cergy-Pontoise.

Following its privatisation in 1987, TF1 retired from the TV5 consortium but continued to supply its programmes to the channel until 1995. On 1 September 1988, TV5 Québec Canada was created, followed by TV5 Afrique in 1991. The following year, TV5 transmitted using digital compression towards Latin America and the Caribbean. Its coverage was expanded in 1996 with the launch of its Asian-Pacific signal with TV5 Asie-Pacifique and the subscription channel TV5 États-Unis in the United States. Two years later, the Middle East feed was launched with TV5 Moyen-Orient in 1998.

In early 1999, TV5 split its European signal into two, with the launch of TV5 France Belgique Suisse, a signal specific to Francophone Europe (France, Belgium, Switzerland, Monaco, Luxembourg). TV5 Europe continued to serve the wider continental audience.

A consortium formed by public channels Arte and La Cinquième entered into the capital of the channel, which brought with it new sources of programming. A new schedule was constructed, centred on news programmes such as news flashes on the hour, two TV5 bulletins and rebroadcasts of its partners&#x27; main news programmes (&quot;20 Heures&quot; from France 2, &quot;Soir 3&quot; from France 3, &quot;Le Journal&quot; from TSR/RTS and &quot;13 Heures&quot; from RTBF).

A meeting with ministers from TV5 in Vevey, Switzerland, gave a mandate to the channel&#x27;s council of co-operation to reform the structure of the channel in the view of creating a unique worldwide channel. The national governments in charge of the five participants gave an agreement to turn management of TV5 États-Unis and TV5 Amérique Latine over to TV5 Monde, the new name for the channel&#x27;s head operations in Paris.

From the September 11 attacks in 2001 to the 2003 Iraq War, the media coverage put the spotlight on TV5&#x27;s particular way of broadcasting news bulletins from its member public broadcasters. International conflicts arising from the decision to go to war by the United States and the United Kingdom in which France notably refused to participate had relaunched the debate over whether to create an international news channel from a French perspective, resulting in the 2006 launch of France 24.

With the creation of France 24 placing TV5&#x27;s own existence in doubt, its new CEO, Jean-Jacques Aillagon decided from 1 January 2006 to rename the channel to TV5Monde to underline its status better as the only international Francophone channel available on-air (France 24 was then available only in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the United States cities of New York and Washington, DC, in French). Aillagon stepped down from his post on 3 March 2006.

The name TV5Monde applies only to its eight different signals, broadcast from its Paris headquarters. In Canada, such as in French-speaking Quebec, TV5 Quebec Canada is managed from Montreal, which keeps the original name TV5, as it is operated by an independent company that is distinct from TV5Monde. As well as being part of the TV5 family, TV5 Quebec Canada has its own management and its schedule is made with the Canadian viewer in mind and to conform to Canadian broadcast regulations, which, sets domestic production quotas and limits foreign investors to a minority stake.

In 2007, a new programme schedule saw the reduction of programming from France Télévisions (France 2, 3 and 5), for example, ti one daily news bulletin from France 2 by abandoning France 3&#x27;s midday news programme. In 2008, TV5Monde became part of holding company France Monde.

In 2009, TV5Monde split its Asia-Pacific signal into two, one of them being TV5Monde Asie, a feed for territories located between GMT+8 (Hong Kong) and GMT+12 (New Zealand). TV5Monde&#x27;s Pacific signal is an adaptation of its existing Asian signal that has been adopted to its time zones to serve its viewers better. It currently broadcasts in Oceania and, despite the signal&#x27;s name, in Japan, South Korea and South East Asia.

On 25 February 2015, the new signal TV5Monde Brésil was launched broadcasting its programming with Portuguese subtitles.

Monaco was announced to be joining the service with its public service broadcaster, TVMonaco (formerly called Monte-Carlo Riviera TV before its launch), from 1 September 2023.

===April 2015 cyberattack and resulting disruption===
On the evening of 8 April 2015, TV5Monde was the victim of a cyberattack by a hacker group known as &quot;CyberCaliphate&quot;, which claimed to have ties to the terrorist organization Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The hackers breached the broadcaster&#x27;s internal systems in what Director Yves Bigot described as an &quot;unprecedented&quot; attack, overriding TV5Monde&#x27;s broadcast programming for over three hours, with service only partially restored in the early hours of the following morning. Normal broadcasting services were still disrupted late into 9 April. Various computerised internal administrative and support systems including e-mail were also still shut down or otherwise inaccessible because of the attack. The hackers also hijacked TV5Monde&#x27;s Facebook and Twitter pages to post the personal information of relatives of French soldiers participating in actions against the organization, along with messages critical of President François Hollande arguing that the January 2015 terrorist attacks were &quot;gifts&quot; for his &quot;unforgivable mistake&quot; of partaking in conflicts that &quot;[serve] no purpose&quot;.

As part of the official response to the attack, the French Minister of Culture and Communications, Fleur Pellerin, called for an emergency meeting of the heads of various major media outlets and groups. The meeting took place on 10 April at an undisclosed location. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls called the attack &quot;an unacceptable insult to freedom of information and expression&quot;. A colleague in his cabinet, the Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, attempted to allay public concern by stating that France &quot;had already increased its anti-hacking measures to protect against cyber-attacks&quot; since the aforementioned terrorist attacks on January earlier that year, which had left a total of 20 people dead.

French investigators later discounted the theory that the attack was connected to ISIL but instead suspected the APT28 or &quot;Pawn Storm&quot;, a hacking group with alleged links to the Russian government. Investigators concluded that the attack was a test of the same sorts of cyberweaponry that were used to switch off a power station in Ukraine.

As a result, Airbus Defence and Space implemented the Keelback Net cybersensor.

==Content==
Most of its content is taken from mainstream networks in the French-speaking world, notably France Télévisions from France, TVMonaco from Monaco, RTBF from Belgium, RTS from Switzerland and the Radio-Canada and TVA networks in Canada.

<doc id="611705" wikidata="Q20050783" url="?curid=611705" title="Macclesfield Bank">
<text>Macclesfield Bank is an elongated sunken atoll of underwater reefs and shoals in the South China Sea. It lies east of the Paracel Islands, southwest of Pratas Island and north of the Spratly Islands. It is about long from southwest to northeast, and about wide at its broadest part. With an ocean area of it is one of the largest atolls in the world. The Macclesfield Bank is part of what China calls the Zhongsha Islands, which includes a number of geographically separate submarine features, and also refers to a county-level administrative division.

== History ==
Macclesfield banks reportedly were named after British ship named &quot;Macclesfield&quot;, though there is some ambiguity which vessel this was. By one account, the vessel was the British East India Company East Indiaman , which mapped and recorded the shoals in early 1701 on her way back to England from China. An alternative origin story attributes the name to an HMS &quot;Macclesfield&quot; that reportedly ran aground in the vicinity of these shoals in 1804.

In April 1888 , under the command of William Usborne Moore, with Percy Bassett-Smith as Surgeon-Naturalist, mapped the banks. They found a depth of inside the bank, with the rim rising to within of the surface. Dredging found live corals, showing that although entirely submerged, the bank was an actively growing reef.

== Geography ==
The broken coral reef rim of Macclesfield Bank, with a width of up to , has depths of at Pygmy Shoal on the northeast end of the bank and depths of 11.6 to elsewhere. Within the lagoon, Walker Shoal marks the least known depth of . In general, the central lagoon is very deep, with depths up to . While the bank is everywhere submerged, with no drying shoals, it is usually visible due to the turbulence it causes, the seas becoming &quot;high and confused&quot; in heavy weather.

The elongated atoll consists of the following shoals, clockwise starting in the northeast, and at the end the six named shoals in the lagoon:
1 inside lagoon

== Territorial claims ==

Macclesfield Bank is claimed, in whole or in part, by China and Taiwan (Republic of China).

Jose Zaide, a Filipino diplomat of ambassadorial rank, has written that the Philippines does not claim the Macclesfield Bank. Moreover, Macclesfield Bank is not within UNCLOS 200 or Philippines EEZ.

As the bank is entirely underwater, some scholars have raised questions regarding the legality of territorial claims upon it with regards to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). However, the Philippines filed claim for another underwater feature, the Benham Rise, in 2008 in compliance with the requirements of UNCLOS and UN officially approved the claim in April 2012.

<text>Mornington is a seaside town of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia located on the Mornington Peninsula south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District. It is the most populous town in the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Mornington had a population of 25,759 at the 2021 census.

Mornington is a tourist destination renowned for its bay beaches and wineries, with a town centre that runs into the foreshore area and local beach.

==History==

Originally home to the Indigenous Boonwurrung people, the first European settlers arrived in the area in the 1840s for fishing, logging and agriculture.

A 46-metre long pier was opened in 1858 and became the social and economic gateway to the Mornington Peninsula, connecting the surrounding areas with Melbourne. Originally known as Schnapper (or Snapper) Point, the town was renamed Mornington in 1864 after the second Earl of Mornington. The Courthouse was built in 1861 and the Post Office in 1863. The Grand Hotel was originally opened in 1892 at 126 Main Street as an alcohol-free Grand Coffee Palace designed by notable Melbourne architect William Pitt. Mornington became a popular tourist destination, with day trippers travelling from Melbourne on steamers from the 1860&#x27;s.

<text>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

Among Web professionals, &quot;Web development&quot; usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.

== Evolution of the World Wide Web and web development ==

=== Origin/ Web 1.0 ===
Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989 at CERN.

The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, HTML was developed in 1993.

Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small amount of information. Core protocols of web 1.0 were HTTP, HTML and URI.

=== Web 2.0 ===
Web 2.0, a term popularised by Dale Dougherty, then vice president of O&#x27;Reilly, during a 2004 conference with Media Live, marks a shift in internet usage, emphasizing interactivity.

Web 2.0 introduced increased user engagement and communication. It evolved from the static, read-only nature of Web 1.0 and became an integrated network for engagement and communication. It is often referred to as a user-focused, read-write online network.

In the realm of Web 2.0 environments, users now have access to a platform that encourages sharing activities such as creating music, files, images, and movies. The architecture of Web 2.0 is often considered the &quot;backbone of the internet,&quot; using standardized XML (Extensible Markup Language) tags to authorize information flow from independent platforms and online databases.

=== Web 3.0 ===
Web 3.0, considered the third and current version of the web, was introduced in 2014. The concept envisions a complete redesign of the web. Key features include the integration of metadata, precise information delivery, and improved user experiences based on preferences, history, and interests.

Web 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized database, providing more functionality than traditional search engines. Users can customize navigation based on their preferences, and the core ideas involve identifying data sources, connecting them for efficiency, and creating user profiles.

This version is sometimes also known as Semantic Web.

=== Evolution of web development technologies ===
The journey of web development technologies began with simple HTML pages in the early days of the internet. Over time, advancements led to the incorporation of CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. This evolution transformed static websites into dynamic and responsive platforms, setting the stage for the complex and feature-rich web applications we have today.

* Static HTML Pages (1990s)
* Introduction of CSS (late 1990s)
* JavaScript and Dynamic HTML (1990s - early 2000s)
* AJAX (1998)
* Rise of Content management systems (CMS) (mid-2000s)
* Mobile web (late 2000s - 2010s)
* Single-page applications (SPAs) and front-end frameworks (2010s)
* Server-side javaScript (2010s)
* Microservices and API-driven development (2010s - present)
* Progressive web apps (PWAs) (2010s - present)
* JAMstack Architecture (2010s - present)
* WebAssembly (Wasm) (2010s - present)
* Serverless computing (2010s - present)
* AI and machine learning integration (2010s - present)

Web development in future will be driven by advances in browser technology, Web internet infrastructure, protocol standards, software engineering methods, and application trends.

== Web development life cycle ==
The web development life cycle is a method that outlines the stages involved in building websites and web applications. It provides a structured approach, ensuring optimal results throughout the development process.

A typical Web Development process can be divided into 7 steps.

=== Analysis ===
Debra Howcraft and John Carroll proposed a methodology in which web development process can be divided into sequential steps. They mentioned different aspects of analysis.

Phase one involves crafting a web strategy and analyzing how a website can effectively achieve its goals. Keil et al.&#x27;s research identifies the primary reasons for software project failures as a lack of top management commitment and misunderstandings of system requirements. To mitigate these risks, Phase One establishes strategic goals and objectives, designing a system to fulfill them. The decision to establish a web presence should ideally align with the organization&#x27;s corporate information strategy.

The analysis phase can be divided into 3 steps:
* Development of a web strategy
* Defining objectives
* Objective analysis

During this phase, the previously outlined objectives and available resources undergo analysis to determine their feasibility. This analysis is divided into six tasks, as follows:

* Technology analysis: Identification of all necessary technological components and tools for constructing, hosting, and supporting the site.
* Information analysis: Identification of user-required information, whether static (web page) or dynamic (pulled &quot;live&quot; from a database server).
* Skills analysis: Identification of the diverse skill sets necessary to complete the project.
* User analysis: Identification of all intended users of the site, a more intricate process due to the varied range of users and technologies they may use.
* Cost analysis: Estimation of the development cost for the site or an evaluation of what is achievable within a predefined budget.
* Risk analysis: Examination of any major risks associated with site development.

Following this analysis, a more refined set of objectives is documented. Objectives that cannot be presently fulfilled are recorded in a Wish List, constituting part of the Objectives Document. This documentation becomes integral to the iterative process during the subsequent cycle of the methodology.

=== Planning: sitemap and wireframe ===
It is crucial for web developers to be engaged in formulating a plan and determining the optimal architecture and selecting the frameworks. Additionally, developers/consultants play a role in elucidating the total cost of ownership associated with supporting a website, which may surpass the initial development expenses.

Key aspects in this step are:
* Sitemap creation
* Wireframe creation
* Tech stack

=== Design and layout ===
Following the analysis phase, the development process moves on to the design phase, which is guided by the objectives document. Recognizing the incremental growth of websites and the potential lack of good design architecture, the methodology includes iteration to account for changes and additions over the life of the site. The design phase, which is divided into Information Design and Graphic Design, results in a detailed Design Document that details the structure of the website, database data structures, and CGI scripts.*

The following step, design testing, focuses on early, low-cost testing to identify inconsistencies or flaws in the design. This entails comparing the website&#x27;s design to the goals and objectives outlined in the first three steps. Phases One and Two involve an iterative loop in which objectives in the Objectives Document are revisited to ensure alignment with the design. Any objectives that are removed are added to the Wish List for future consideration.

Key aspects in this step are:
* Page layouts
* Review
* Approval

=== Content creation ===
No matter how visually appealing a website is, good communication with clients is critical. The primary purpose of content production is to create a communication channel through the user interface by delivering relevant information about your firm in an engaging and easily understandable manner. This includes:

* Developing appealing calls to action
* Making creative headlines
* Content formatting for readability
* Carrying out line editing
* Text updating throughout the site development process.

The stage of content production is critical in establishing the branding and marketing of your website or web application. It serves as a platform for defining the purpose and goals of your online presence through compelling and convincing content.

=== Development ===
During this critical stage, the website is built while keeping its fundamental goal in mind, paying close attention to all graphic components to assure the establishment of a completely working site.

The procedure begins with the development of the main page, which is followed by the production of interior pages. The site&#x27;s navigational structure is being refined in particular.

During this development phase, key functionality such as the Content Management System, interactive contact forms, and shopping carts are activated.

The coding process includes creating all of the site&#x27;s software and installing it on the appropriate Web servers. This can range from simple things like posting to a Web server to more complex tasks like establishing database connections.

=== Testing, review and launch ===
In any web project, the testing phase is incredibly intricate and difficult. Because web apps are frequently designed for a diverse and often unknown user base running in a range of technological environments, their complexity exceeds that of traditional Information Systems (IS). To ensure maximum reach and efficacy, the website must be tested in a variety of contexts and technologies. The website moves to the delivery stage after gaining final approval from the designer. To ensure its preparation for launch, the quality assurance team performs rigorous testing for functionality, compatibility, and performance.

Additional testing is carried out, including integration, stress, scalability, load, resolution, and cross-browser compatibility. When the approval is given, the website is pushed to the server via FTP, completing the development process.

Key aspects in this step are:
* Test Lost Links
* Use code validators
* Check browser

=== Maintenance and updating ===
The web development process goes beyond deployment to include a variety of post-deployment tasks.

Websites, in example, are frequently under ongoing maintenance, with new items being uploaded on a daily basis. The maintenance costs increases immensely as the site grows in size. The accuracy of content on a website is critical, demanding continuous monitoring to verify that both information and links, particularly external links, are updated. Adjustments are made in response to user feedback, and regular support and maintenance actions are carried out to maintain the website&#x27;s long-term effectiveness.

== Traditional development methodologies ==
Debra Howcraft and John Carroll discussed a few traditional web development methodologies in their research paper:

* Waterfall: The waterfall methodology comprises a sequence of cascading steps, addressing the development process with minimal iteration between each stage. However, a significant drawback when applying the waterfall methodology to the development of websites (as well as information systems) lies in its rigid structure, lacking iteration beyond adjacent stages. Any methodology used for the development of Web-sites must be flexible enough to cope with change.
* Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM): Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM) is a widely used methodology for systems analysis and design in information systems and software engineering. Although it does not cover the entire lifecycle of a development project, it places a strong emphasis on the stages of analysis and design in the hopes of minimizing later-stage, expensive errors and omissions.
* Prototyping: Prototyping is a software development approach in which a preliminary version of a system or application is built to visualize and test its key functionalities. The prototype serves as a tangible representation of the final product, allowing stakeholders, including users and developers, to interact with it and provide feedback.
* Rapid Application Development: Rapid Application Development (RAD) is a software development methodology that prioritizes speed and flexibility in the development process. It is designed to produce high-quality systems quickly, primarily through the use of iterative prototyping and the involvement of end-users. RAD aims to reduce the time it takes to develop a system and increase the adaptability to changing requirements.
* Incremental Prototyping: Incremental prototyping is a software development approach that combines the principles of prototyping and incremental development. In this methodology, the development process is divided into small increments, with each increment building upon the functionality of the previous one. At the same time, prototypes are created and refined in each increment to better meet user requirements and expectations.

== Key technologies in web development ==
Developing a fundamental knowledge of client-side and server-side dynamics is crucial.

The goal of front-end development is to create a website&#x27;s user interface and visual components that users may interact with directly. On the other hand, back-end development works with databases, server-side logic, and application functionality. Building reliable and user-friendly online applications requires a comprehensive approach, which is ensured by collaboration between front-end and back-end engineers.

=== Front-end development ===
Front-end development is the process of designing and implementing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a web application. It involves creating visually appealing and interactive elements that users interact with directly. The primary technologies and concepts associated with front-end development include:

==== Technologies ====
The 3 core technologies for front-end development are:
* HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML provides the structure and organization of content on a webpage.
* CSS (Cascading Style Sheet): Responsible for styling and layout, CSS enhances the presentation of HTML elements, making the application visually appealing.
* JavaScript: It is used to add interactions to the web pages. Advancement in JavaScript has given rise to many popular front- end frameworks like React, Angular and Vue.js etc.

==== User interface design ====
User experience design focuses on creating interfaces that are intuitive, accessible, and enjoyable for users. It involves understanding user behavior, conducting usability studies, and implementing design principles to enhance the overall satisfaction of users interacting with a website or application. This involves wireframing, prototyping, and implementing design principles to enhance user interaction. Some of the popular tools used for UI Wireframing are -

* Sketch for detailed, vector-based design
* Moqups for beginners
* Figma for a free wireframe app
* UXPin for handing off design documentation to developers
* MockFlow for project organization
* Justinmind for interactive wireframes
* Uizard for AI-assisted wireframing

Another key aspect to keep in mind while designing is Web Accessibility- Web accessibility ensures that digital content is available and usable for people of all abilities. This involves adhering to standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), implementing features like alternative text for images, and designing with considerations for diverse user needs, including those with disabilities.

==== Responsive design ====
It is important to ensure that web applications are accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes. Responsive design uses CSS media queries and flexible layouts to adapt to different viewing environments.

==== Front-end frameworks ====
A framework is a high-level solution for the reuse of software pieces, a step forward in simple library-based reuse that allows for sharing common functions and generic logic of a domain application.

Frameworks and libraries are essential tools that expedite the development process. These tools enhance developer productivity and contribute to the maintainability of large-scale applications. Some popular front-end frameworks are:

* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook. It allows developers to create reusable UI components.
* Angular: A TypeScript-based front-end framework developed and maintained by Google. It provides a comprehensive solution for building dynamic single-page applications.
* Vue.js: A progressive JavaScript framework that is approachable yet powerful, making it easy to integrate with other libraries or existing projects.

==== State management ====
Managing the state of a web application to ensure data consistency and responsiveness. State management libraries like Redux (for React) or Vuex (for Vue.js) play a crucial role in complex applications.

=== Back-end development ===
Back-end development involves building the server-side logic and database components of a web application. It is responsible for processing user requests, managing data, and ensuring the overall functionality of the application. Key aspects of back-end development include:

==== Server/ cloud instance ====
An essential component of the architecture of a web application is a server or cloud instance. A cloud instance is a virtual server instance that can be accessed via the Internet and is created, delivered, and hosted on a public or private cloud. It functions as a physical server that may seamlessly move between various devices with ease or set up several instances on one server. It is therefore very dynamic, scalable, and economical.

==== Databases ====
Database management is crucial for storing, retrieving, and managing data in web applications. Various database systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, play distinct roles in organizing and structuring data. Effective database management ensures the responsiveness and efficiency of data-driven web applications. There are 3 types of databases:

* Relational databases: Structured databases that use tables to organize and relate data. Common Examples include - MySQL, PostgreSQL and many more.
* NoSQL databases: NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and can be more flexible than relational databases. They come in various types, such as document-oriented, key-value stores, column-family stores, and graph databases. Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, ScyllaDB, CouchDB, Redis.
* Document stores: Document stores store data in a semi-structured format, typically using JSON or XML documents. Each document can have a different structure, providing flexibility. Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB.
* Key-value stores: Key-value stores store data as pairs of keys and values. They are simple and efficient for certain types of operations, like caching. Examples: Redis, DynamoDB.
* Column-family stores: Column-family stores organize data into columns instead of rows, making them suitable for large-scale distributed systems and analytical workloads. Examples: Apache Cassandra, HBase.
* Graph databases: Graph databases are designed to represent and query data in the form of graphs. They are effective for handling relationships and network-type data. Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.
* In-memory databases: In-memory databases store data in the system&#x27;s main memory (RAM) rather than on disk. This allows for faster data access and retrieval. Examples: Redis, Memcached.
* Time-series databases: Time-series databases are optimized for handling time-stamped data, making them suitable for applications that involve tracking changes over time. Examples: InfluxDB, OpenTSDB.
* NewSQL databases: NewSQL databases aim to provide the scalability of NoSQL databases while maintaining the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) of traditional relational databases. Examples: Google Spanner, CockroachDB.
* Object-oriented databases: Object-oriented databases store data in the form of objects, which can include both data and methods. They are designed to work seamlessly with object-oriented programming languages. Examples: db4o, ObjectDB.

The choice of a database depends on various factors such as the nature of the data, scalability requirements, performance considerations, and the specific use case of the application being developed. Each type of database has its strengths and weaknesses, and selecting the right one involves considering the specific needs of the project.

==== Application programming interface (APIs) ====
Application Programming Interfaces are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

* RESTful APIs and GraphQL are common approaches for defining and interacting with web services.

===== Types of APIs =====
* Web APIs: These are APIs that are accessible over the internet using standard web protocols such as HTTP. RESTful APIs are a common type of web API.
* Library APIs: These APIs provide pre-built functions and procedures that developers can use within their code.
* Operating System APIs: These APIs allow applications to interact with the underlying operating system, accessing features like file systems, hardware, and system services.

==== Server-side languages ====
Programming languages aimed at server execution, as opposed to client browser execution, are known as server-side languages. These programming languages are used in web development to perform operations including data processing, database interaction, and the creation of dynamic content that is delivered to the client&#x27;s browser. A key element of server-side programming is server-side scripting, which allows the server to react to client requests in real time.

Some popular server-side languages are:

# PHP: PHP is a widely used, open-source server-side scripting language. It is embedded in HTML code and is particularly well-suited for web development.
# Python: Python is a versatile, high-level programming language used for a variety of purposes, including server-side web development. Frameworks like Django and Flask make it easy to build web applications in Python.
# Ruby: Ruby is an object-oriented programming language, and it is commonly used for web development. Ruby on Rails is a popular web framework that simplifies the process of building web applications.
# Java: Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Java-based frameworks like Spring are commonly used for building enterprise-level web applications.
# Node.js (JavaScript): While JavaScript is traditionally a client-side language, Node.js enables developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it suitable for building scalable and high-performance applications.
# C# (C Sharp): C# is a programming language developed by Microsoft and is commonly used in conjunction with the .NET framework for building web applications on the Microsoft stack.
# ASP.NET: ASP.NET is a web framework developed by Microsoft, and it supports languages like C# and VB.NET. It simplifies the process of building dynamic web applications.
# Go (Golang): Go is a statically typed language developed by Google. It is known for its simplicity and efficiency and is increasingly being used for building scalable and high-performance web applications.
# Perl: Perl is a versatile scripting language often used for web development. It is known for its powerful text-processing capabilities.
# Swift: Developed by Apple, Swift is used for server-side development in addition to iOS and macOS app development.
# Lua: Lua is used for some embedded web servers, e.g. the configuration pages on a router, including OpenWRT.

==== Security measures ====
Implementing security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Authentication and authorization mechanisms are crucial for securing data and user access.

==== Testing, debugging and deployment ====
Thorough testing and debugging processes are essential for identifying and resolving issues in a web application. Testing may include unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. Debugging involves pinpointing and fixing errors in the code, ensuring the reliability and stability of the application.

* Unit Testing: Testing individual components or functions to verify that they work as expected.
* Integration Testing: Testing the interactions between different components or modules to ensure they function correctly together.
* Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): CI/CD pipelines automate testing, deployment, and delivery processes, allowing for faster and more reliable releases.

=== Full-stack development ===
Full-stack development refers to the practice of designing, building, and maintaining the entire software stack of a web application. This includes both the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) components, as well as the database and any other necessary infrastructure. A full-stack developer is someone who has expertise in working with both the frontend and backend technologies, allowing them to handle all aspects of web application development.

* MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) are popular full-stack development stacks that streamline the development process by providing a cohesive set of technologies.

=== Web development tools and environments ===
Efficient web development relies on a set of tools and environments that streamline the coding and collaboration processes:

# Integrated development environments (IDEs): Tools like Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text provide features such as code highlighting, autocompletion, and version control integration, enhancing the development experience.
# Version control: Git is a widely used version control system that allows developers to track changes, collaborate seamlessly, and roll back to previous versions if needed.
# Collaboration tools: Communication platforms like Slack, project management tools such as Jira, and collaboration platforms like GitHub facilitate effective teamwork and project management.

Security is paramount in web development to protect against cyber threats and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data. Best practices include encryption, secure coding practices, regular security audits, and staying informed about the latest security vulnerabilities and patches.

* Common threats: Developers must be aware of common security threats, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
* Secure coding practices: Adhering to secure coding practices involves input validation, proper data sanitization, and ensuring that sensitive information is stored and transmitted securely.
* Authentication and authorization: Implementing robust authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth or JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensures that only authorized users can access specific resources within the application.

== Agile methodology in web development ==

=== Agile manifesto and principles ===
Agile is a set of principles and values for software development that prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. The four key values are:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
* Working software over comprehensive documentation.
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
* Responding to change over following a plan.

=== Agile concepts in web development ===

# Iterative and incremental development: Building and refining a web application through small, repeatable cycles, enhancing features incrementally with each iteration.
# Scrum and kanban: Employing agile frameworks like Scrum for structured sprints or Kanban for continuous flow to manage tasks and enhance team efficiency.
# Cross-functional teams: Forming collaborative teams with diverse skill sets, ensuring all necessary expertise is present for comprehensive web development.
# Customer collaboration: Engaging customers throughout the development process to gather feedback, validate requirements, and ensure the delivered product aligns with expectations.
# Adaptability to change: Embracing changes in requirements or priorities even late in the development process to enhance the product&#x27;s responsiveness to evolving needs.
# User stories and backlog: Capturing functional requirements through user stories and maintaining a backlog of prioritized tasks to guide development efforts.
# Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD): Implementing automated processes to continuously integrate code changes and deliver updated versions, ensuring a streamlined and efficient development pipeline.

<text>Mount Eliza is a seaside suburb on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Mount Eliza recorded a population of 18,734 at the 2021 census.

==History==
The traditional Boonwurrung name for the mount is Berringwallin. The mount was given its European name in 1836 after Captain William Hobson’s wife, Eliza Elliott.

Prior to large scale subdivision, Mount Eliza was mainly a location for holiday homes, with the Mount Eliza Post Office opening on 15 November 1920. This began to change in the early half of the 20th century when many old estates were subdivided. One such subdivision was Ranelagh Estate, designed by Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin in 1924 in tandem with the surveyors Tuxen and Miller.

Daveys Bay was named after James Davey who constructed a jetty in the 1840s to ship his produce to Melbourne. In 1909 the Daveys Bay Yacht Club was established, and winds its way to a walking track overlooking Mt Eliza Beach on the shores of Canadian Bay, which was named after three Canadians who owned a sawmill in the area in the 1950s. In 1928, the independent girls school Toorak College was built and is one of the oldest independent girls schools in Victoria. By the 1950s the shopping precinct began to develop and by the 1960s was a well established shopping village. Hollywood glamour came to Mt Eliza in 1959 when movie stars Fred Astaire, Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner arrived to shoot the Stanley Kramer film, On The Beach, based on the novel of the same name by British novelist Nevil Shute who had lived at nearby Langwarrin.

Adjacent to Sunnyside beach sits a historical property Morning Star Estate. Morning Star Estate is a distinctive example of a Victorian era mansion built as a rural or holiday retreat on the Mornington Peninsula, it incorporates a number of architectural styles – including Tudor and Gothic Revival.

Sunnyside estate (now Morning Star Estate) was originally purchased by Londoner Francis Alfred Gillett in 1865 a short time after he arrived in the colony in 1853. Gillett designed the Sunnyside mansion sometime around 1867–1870. In 1932 the property was purchased, with funds from a bequest, by the Catholic Church and became known as Morning Star Boys&#x27; Home. The boys’ home was developed into a country-training centre for delinquent boys, giving them exposure to the benefits of rural life. The boys later became involved in an extensive building program, which led to further developments of the property. Despite this, the mansion remained the dominant architectural feature of the property.

Renovations and extensions were undertaken by the Franciscans in 1944–1946. Some effort to follow the lead of the mansion was made in the external Tudor/Gothic detailing of the large chapel. A number of courtyards were formed by the new buildings, including a large courtyard which was used for sports and was later enclosed. The remains of a football field lie to the south of the building complex, and a tall angular concrete pillar near the Nepean Highway originally carried a statue of the Virgin Mary sculpted by one of the brothers.

Morning Star Estate has been in a number of films due to its location and historical buildings, including a three-month location shoot around the mansion for the movie Partisan, starring French actor Vincent Cassel, during 2013 and 2014. The mansion was also the location for the Kath &amp; Kim movie spin-off Kath &amp; Kimderella.

Morning Star estate is also home to possibly the largest rose garden in Victoria, and the gardens surrounding the main mansion are home to more than 700 varieties of ornamental roses.

<text>Mount Martha is a suburb on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Mount Martha recorded a population of 19,746 at the 2021 census.

Mount Martha is located on the southeastern shores of Port Phillip and offers a bathing beach. A boardwalk winds its way for more than along the Balcombe Creek, its North beach mouth to the Briars Historic Park. The suburb&#x27;s highest point bears the area&#x27;s name and reaches . The peak was named in 1836 after Captain William Hobson&#x27;s mother, Martha Jones.

It marks the start of the Selwyn fault, a geological formation that runs to the eastern Dandenong Ranges.

==History==

Mount Martha has its roots dating back to the 1840s when the township&#x27;s major role was that of farming. The Briars Homestead in the town&#x27;s east was constructed from 1848 to 1851 and was used by Alexander Balcombe until 1876 as he farmed the land surrounding it and tended to of vineyards. The homestead was named after the lodging of the same name in Saint Helena. Dame Mabel Brookes collected Napoleonic memorabilia which was also donated to the Mornington Peninsula shire; some is on display at the house.

In 1890, the Martha Hotel, designed by architects Tappin, Gilbert and Dennehy was constructed in a Federation Queen Anne style. Today, the building now known as Mt. Martha House serves as a community centre and is Victorian Heritage listed. As the population grew, the Mount Martha Post Office opened around 1902.

During the Second World War, Mount Martha&#x27;s Balcombe Creek camp hosted the United States Marine Corps&#x27;s 1st Marine Division in late 1942 following their involvement in the Battle of Guadalcanal. After the conclusion of the war, it was progressively relocated or demolished until 1999. The area is now known as Balcombe Estuary and has barbecue facilities (including an open fireplace) as well as a children&#x27;s play area in the west, and residential allocations were made in the east. Also during the Second World War, Mount Martha House had extensive use by the military and functioned as a Women&#x27;s Royal Australian Army Corps (WRAAC) barracks up until 1978.

In 1978, a water treatment plant was constructed in the town&#x27;s east. It services the nearby suburbs of Mornington, Mount Eliza, Mount Martha, Somerville, Pearcedale and Baxter, and provides treated water to local vineyards, a tree plantation and lawns.

==Present day==

More recently from the 1990s to the present the Mount Martha area has experienced significant population growth, particularly in the south with the Martha Cove marina development as well as east towards the Moorooduc Highway. This has led to the area being incredibly crowded in Summer, with little or no areas to park.

Mount Martha is home to a volunteer CFA fire brigade responding on average to 180 calls a year for assistance from the community. Incidents range from grass and scrub fires and motor vehicle accidents to house fires.

Martha Cove, a large inland harbour and residential development in Safety Beach, was named after its location in the cove at the foot of Mount Martha. The project, which began in 2004, was initially heavily protested by residents. After experiencing considerable financial difficulties, Martha Cove recovered and became a thriving residential community.

==Transport==

Peninsula Link and the Mornington Peninsula Freeway are both major arterial routes to both Mount Martha and the Mornington Peninsula, from Melbourne (via the EastLink tollway).

==Sport==

Mount Martha volunteer Surf Lifesaving Club holds the popular annual Mount Martha Australia Day Swim, the &quot;MMAD Swim&quot;. Golfers play at the course of the Mount Martha Golf Club on Forest Drive. Mount Martha is also home to public tennis courts, four football ovals and numerous grass reserves.

Mornington Peninsula Pony Club provides dressage, show jumping and cross-country facilities for young equestrian enthusiasts. The club is affiliated with the Pony Club Association of Victoria.

<text>The Arda ( , , ) is a river in Bulgaria and Greece. It is a tributary of the Maritsa (or Evros). Its source lies in the Bulgarian Rhodope Mountains near the village Arda, part of the municipality of Smolyan. It flows eastward past Rudozem, Kardzhali and Ivaylovgrad and enters Greece in the northern part of the Evros regional unit. It flows into the Maritsa on the border of Greece and Turkey, between the Greek village Kastanies and the Turkish city Edirne. In the Bulgarian section, there are three hydroelectric and irrigation dams, Kardzhali Dam, Studen Kladenets and Ivaylovgrad Dam. The Bulgarian section is long, making the Arda the longest river in the Rhodopes. The medieval Dyavolski most arch bridge crosses the river from Ardino.

The three floods of February 18, 2005, when the water level was at , March 1 and March 7, 2005, flooded the low-lying areas, especially the Kastanies area which turned into a lagoon. The merging of the waters of the Maritsa (Evros/Meriç) caused streets and buildings including homes to be flooded, leaving people stranded in their homes.

Arda Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica and the mineral ardaite are named after the Arda river.

==Archeology and places of interest==

The Arda valley and the valleys of its tributaries have been a preferred place for habitation since ancient times. A settlement from 6,000 BC was discovered during the construction works in the area of the town of Kardzhali. Many archeological sites were discovered in the region, including the famous Thracian cult complexes Perperek, known as Perperikon for the last 20 years, as well as the sacred site of Tatul. To cross the ancient roads to the Aegean, several stone bridges were built on the river, impressive in size and architecture. One fully preserved bridge is the Devil&#x27;s Bridge in the area of the village of Dyadovtsi (Ardino municipality). There are remnants of bridges in several places in the region: near the villages of Suhovo and Borovitsa, and another three have remained under the waters of the dams.

<doc id="611729" wikidata="Q7208062" url="?curid=611729" title="Point Leo, Victoria">
<text>Point Leo is a town on the shore of Western Port bay on the eastern side of the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Point Leo recorded a population of 178 at the 2021 census.

Point Leo Foreshore Reserve provides excellent waves for surfing and is one of the closest surf beaches to Melbourne.

==History==

The area was known as Bobbanaring to the local Bunurong people prior to European settlement. The area was first surveyed in 1841, and a town was proposed here in 1869, but the area did not develop until after World War II, when the Woods family built a house and store. Facilities were developed in the 1960s, including camping grounds, toilet blocks with hot showers on the foreshore and a kiosk on the surf beach. A Post Office opened on 8 December 1969, but closed in 1974. By the 1980s the area was still dominated by holiday homes and weekend travellers with few permanent residents.

==Present day==

The small town contains a general store and supports an active surf lifesaving club and boat club. A large foreshore reserve includes picnic, barbecue and camping areas, managed by Point Leo Foreshore, and provide access to the surf beach. A gate fee is payable. Most other facilities are available from nearby Shoreham and Balnarring.

No public transport services Point Leo directly although the bus route 782 operated by Ventura Bus Lines between Frankston and Flinders passes within 2 km of the town.

<doc id="611731" wikidata="Q344875" url="?curid=611731" title="Ron Atkinson">
<text>Ronald Frederick Atkinson (born 18 March 1939) is an English former football player and manager. Nicknamed &quot;Big Ron&quot;, he was regarded as one of Britain&#x27;s best-known football pundits in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Nicknamed &quot;The Tank&quot; during his playing career, he represented Oxford United for twelve years, and still holds the club record for appearances. As a manager, he won the FA Cup with Manchester United in 1983 and 1985 and the Football League Cup with Sheffield Wednesday in 1991 and Aston Villa in 1994.

==Early life and playing career==
Atkinson was born in Liverpool in the Old Swan area of the city with his brother Graham Atkinson who was also a professional footballer. After a few years his family moved to Shard End (then in Warwickshire, now an area of Birmingham). He attended Lea Village Secondary School. After beginning his career as a ground staff boy at Wolverhampton Wanderers, he was signed by Aston Villa from works team BSA Tools at the age of 17, but never played a first-team match for them. He has referred to then Villa coach Jimmy Hogan as his biggest influence.

Atkinson was transferred to Headington United (renamed Oxford United in 1960) in the summer of 1959 on a free transfer. There he played alongside his younger brother Graham. He went on to make over 500 appearances in all competitions as a wing-half for the club, earning, in his playing days the nickname: &quot;The Tank&quot;, and scoring a total of fourteen goals. He was United&#x27;s captain through their rise from the Southern League to the Second Division, achieved in only six years from 1962 to 1968. He was the first ever footballer to captain a club from the Southern League through three divisions of the Football League and played three seasons in the Second Division.

==Managerial career==
===Kettering Town and Cambridge United===
After retiring from playing, Atkinson became manager player of non-league Kettering Town in 1971, aged only 32. His success there led to a move to the league with Cambridge United, in November 1974, going on to win the Fourth Division in 1977 and leaving them when they were on the verge of promotion to the Second Division, which they later achieved that season under Atkinson&#x27;s assistant John Docherty.

===West Bromwich Albion===
In January 1978, Atkinson moved to manage First Division West Bromwich Albion. He soon signed Brendon Batson from his former club, to play alongside Laurie Cunningham and Cyrille Regis. Never before had a team in the top division of English football simultaneously fielded three black players on a regular basis.

Atkinson led West Bromwich Albion to third place in the league in the season 1978–79 and also to the UEFA Cup quarter-finals. On 30 December 1978 they achieved a famous 5–3 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. The club were second in the table at the time, only beaten off top spot from Liverpool by goal difference. They finished fourth in 1981, and shortly after this Atkinson was appointed the manager of Manchester United following the dismissal of Dave Sexton.

===Manchester United===
Atkinson was seen as the man who could bring the spark to Manchester United that had been so sorely lacking under his predecessor. Sexton had taken them to second place in the league in 1980 but did not win a major trophy in his four years at the club. United had finished eighth in the season before Atkinson&#x27;s appointment, and Atkinson had actually missed out of the chance of overseeing a UEFA Cup campaign by departing from Albion and taking over at United.

In the 1981–82 season, United finished third in the First Division, to qualify for the UEFA Cup, though for much of the season they were one of several teams who topped the table before a late surge from Liverpool saw Bob Paisley&#x27;s team seal the title. Early in the season he had paid a national record £1.5 million for Bryan Robson from his old club West Bromwich Albion, and shortly afterwards also added midfielder Remi Moses, also from West Brom, and Arsenal striker Frank Stapleton to his ranks. He also gave a debut to promising young forward Norman Whiteside in April 1982, just before the player&#x27;s 17th birthday.

In the 1982–83 season, two appearances at Wembley, one of which was an FA Cup victory against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, coupled with another third-place finish in the league, fuelled speculation that United were back in a big way. During the first half of the season, they had topped the league more than once but a storming run of form by Liverpool beginning before Christmas meant that the title headed for Anfield for the second year running. 1982–83 also saw the breakthrough of Whiteside as one of the best performing players in the First Division. Whiteside was also on the scoresheet for the FA Cup final replay as United beat Brighton 4–0 after drawing the first game 2–2.

In the 1983–84 season, Atkinson&#x27;s side reached the semi-finals of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup although their defence of the FA Cup ended at the first hurdle with a shock 2–0 defeat at Third Division team AFC Bournemouth. They finished fourth in the league, having topped the table at several stages once again, before injuries to key players counted against them and they dropped points. The end of the season saw the sale of key midfielder Ray Wilkins to A.C. Milan of Italy for £1.5 million, while the duration of the season had seen the breakthrough of young striker Mark Hughes. Rather than plunge into the transfer market for a big name, Atkinson shifted Norman Whiteside into midfield to fill the gap left by Wilkins and allowed Hughes to form a partnership with the experienced Frank Stapleton.

In the 1984–85 season, United again won the FA Cup. However, Atkinson and his team were denied the chance of another European Cup Winners Cup campaign as the Heysel disaster at the European Cup final that year resulted in an indefinite ban from European competitions for all English clubs.

In the 1985–86 season, they won their first ten games of the league season and were unbeaten after their first fifteen games to build a comfortable lead at the top of the table that lasted into the new year. However, their form tailed off badly and they again finished fourth, with Liverpool finishing the season as league champions. With the ban on English clubs in European competitions continuing, there was not even the consolation of a UEFA Cup place. United&#x27;s title chances were not helped by the fact that captain Bryan Robson was only available for half of United&#x27;s league games due to injuries.

There was more disappointment for United&#x27;s fans when the sale of Mark Hughes to Spanish club Barcelona was announced at the end of the season. Atkinson had prepared for Hughes&#x27; departure in March 1986 by paying Nottingham Forest £570,000 for England striker Peter Davenport. Although Davenport was their top scorer in the 1986–87 season, he failed to achieve the same success as Hughes and was not a popular figure among fans.

Despite media speculation that Atkinson would be sacked in favour of Aberdeen manager Alex Ferguson or Barcelona manager Terry Venables, the 1986–87 season began with Atkinson still at the helm. His two FA Cup wins and five successive top four league finishes had made him the most successful United manager since Matt Busby, but the pressure to build on the earlier successes was becoming more intense than ever. The 1986–87 season began poorly with three successive defeats, and despite a minor upturn in September and October which included a 5–1 home win over Southampton in the league, the pressure on Atkinson remained intense and the board finally ran out of patience on 6 November 1986 when he was dismissed as manager two days after a 4–1 exit at the hands of Southampton in the League Cup. United were still in the bottom four of the First Division with a third of the season already gone.

===Return to West Bromwich Albion===
Atkinson returned to West Brom in the autumn of 1987, by which time they had fallen into the Second Division and were battling against relegation to the Third Division. Survival was achieved, as Albion finished the 1987–88 season in 20th place, and they began the 1988–89 season well, looking like serious promotion contenders. 

===Atlético Madrid===
Following his time at Manchester United, Atkinson was due to take charge of Atlético Madrid, however internal politics at Atlético delayed his appointment, with Atkinson returning to manage West Brom in the meantime. In October 1988, Atkinson was finally appointed manager of Atlético Madrid, winning his first game in charge 6–1 against Espanyol.

Atkinson&#x27;s tenure at Atlético was quite a turbulent one and despite relative moderate success in terms of league position, a clash of personalities with the then-owner of the club, Jesús Gil, led to Atkinson being sacked after just three months as manager. His right-hand man at West Bromwich Albion, Colin Addison, was appointed, much to the disdain of Atkinson, who went on record in the English media as saying Addison had &quot;stabbed him in the back&quot;. The pair never worked together again following the events at Atlético.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
Atkinson went on to manage Sheffield Wednesday from February 1989 to June 1991. Although the club were relegated to the Second Division in May 1990 after a 3–0 home defeat against Nottingham Forest, Atkinson secured promotion back to the First Division the following season. They also won the League Cup that year, beating Manchester United 1–0 at Wembley. On 31 May 1991 Atkinson stated he would be remaining as Wednesday&#x27;s manager, only to leave for Aston Villa a week later, a move that upset many Sheffield Wednesday fans.

===Aston Villa===
Taking over from Jozef Venglos, Atkinson led Aston Villa to second place in the inaugural FA Premier League season in 1992–93 and to victory in the League Cup in 1994, securing (ultimately short-lived) UEFA Cup campaigns for both of these successes. As of 2021, Atkinson&#x27;s second place remains the highest-ever finish by an English manager in the Premier League, subsequently equalled by Kevin Keegan in 1995–96.

Despite leading Villa to their first major success since their 1982 European Cup triumph, a mutual dislike between Villa chairman Doug Ellis and Atkinson that developed from 1992, inevitably resulted in him being sacked on 10 November 1994 following a 4–3 defeat at the hands of Wimbledon – three days after Ellis had given Atkinson a &quot;vote of confidence&quot; in the media, stating that Atkinson was one of England&#x27;s &quot;top three football managers&quot;. By this stage, an ageing Villa side that had so nearly won the league title 18 months earlier were now among the relegation battlers. He was replaced by Brian Little, who kept Villa in the top flight and built a new younger team.

===Coventry City===
Three months after being sacked by Villa, Atkinson became manager at Coventry City replacing Phil Neal, who was purposely and acrimoniously sacked to make way for him. He took over in mid-February 1995, with the Sky Blues just above the Premier League relegation zone. His new team managed some good results, including a 4–2 home win over local rivals Leicester City, a 3–2 away win over Liverpool and a point against a Blackburn Rovers side who ended the season as champions. With survival looking certain several games before the season ended, Atkinson was named Premier League Manager of the Month for March 1995. The penultimate game of the season brought another fine result when the Sky Blues travelled to North London and beat Tottenham Hotspur 3–1. Survival was finally confirmed as Atkinson guided the Sky Blues to a 16th-place finish.

In December 1995, Atkinson guided the Sky Blues to one of their best results of the 1990s, a 5–0 home win over defending champions Blackburn Rovers. During his spell as manager of Coventry, he brought in high-profile players including Gordon Strachan, Noel Whelan and Gary McAllister (although in his autobiography he states that this latter signing was Strachan&#x27;s initiative and he was opposed for tactical reasons) but they continued to struggle in the Premier League and in November 1996 he became Director of Football, handing over managerial duties to Strachan, who by then had retired as a player and had become assistant manager.

===Return to Sheffield Wednesday===
In November 1997, he returned to Sheffield Wednesday following the sacking of David Pleat. Wednesday had made a poor start to the 1997–98 season, including a 7–2 loss at Blackburn and a 6–1 loss at Manchester United. Under Atkinson, Wednesday&#x27;s form picked up immediately and they pulled well clear of relegation trouble, but he was not offered a permanent contract and left the club at the end of the season.

===Nottingham Forest===
Atkinson&#x27;s last managerial job came with Nottingham Forest, for the final four months of the 1998–99 season. This spell was not a success and at his first home game against Arsenal he even climbed into the wrong dug-out. He also angered a number of Forest fans following an 8–1 defeat at home to Manchester United when he stated in an interview after the game that his team had given the fans a &quot;nine-goal thriller&quot;.

Atkinson took over as manager on 11 January 1999 and Forest&#x27;s relegation was confirmed on 24 April with a 2–0 defeat at his old club Aston Villa. He announced his resignation as manager within hours of the final whistle, with effect from the final game of the league season on 16 May and said that he would be retiring from football management altogether.

==Broadcasting career==

===TV work===
Atkinson was already working as a pundit for ITV Sport and after leaving management he continued in this role. For a number of years, he covered most of the channel&#x27;s live matches, sometimes as a studio guest, but more often as the &quot;ex-football insider&quot; member of a two-man commentary team. His commentaries with Brian Moore and then Clive Tyldesley provided the basis for the 1990s and early-2000s ITV Champions League nights. He was also the main co-commentator for ITV&#x27;s coverage of the European Championships and the World Cup during this period. He also fronted two series of &quot;Extra Time with Ron Atkinson&quot; for Central Television, with Ron interviewing football personalities like Kevin Keegan, Terry Venables and Martin O&#x27;Neill.

In 1997, he appeared as manager of Harchester United in &quot;Dream Team&quot;.

In August 2013, Atkinson became a housemate on the twelfth series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;. He was the second housemate to be evicted on Day 9 after receiving the fewest votes to save him against Charlotte Crosby, Courtney Stodden, Lauren Harries and Louie Spence.

===Music===
In 2002, Atkinson released a Christmas song, &quot;It&#x27;s Christmas – Let&#x27;s Give Love a Try&quot;, but this failed to gain chart success. The following year, Atkinson was a guest on an episode of TV chat show &quot;Room 101&quot; and host Paul Merton played the video as an outro to the show.

===Racist comments===
Following his sacking from Atlético Madrid, club president Jesús Gil claimed Atkinson had racially abused his own player, Donato, during his final game in charge of the club against Barcelona in January 1989.

Atkinson resigned from ITV on 21 April 2004, after he made a racist comment live on air about the black Chelsea player Marcel Desailly; believing the microphone to be switched off, he said, &quot;...he [Desailly] is what is known in some schools as a fucking lazy, thick nigger&quot;. Although transmission in the UK had finished, the microphone gaffe meant that his comment was broadcast to various countries in the Middle East. He also left his job as a columnist for &quot;The Guardian&quot; &quot;by mutual agreement&quot; as a result of the comment.

Carlton Palmer, one of Atkinson&#x27;s players while he was manager at Sheffield Wednesday, defended Atkinson by saying, &quot;I&#x27;m black and I&#x27;m sitting here and I&#x27;m gonna stand up for Big Ron not because he&#x27;s a friend of mine; I&#x27;m standing up for him because I know what he&#x27;s like as a bloke. If we&#x27;re going to deal with racism then let&#x27;s deal with the bigger picture of racism not about a throwaway comment that wasn&#x27;t meant in that manner.&quot; A BBC Radio documentary about Batson, Cunningham and Regis, entitled &quot;Three Degrees West&quot;, repeated on 16 May 2004, was cancelled owing to Atkinson&#x27;s central contributions.

Also in 2004, Atkinson said to an audience at Hillsborough Stadium: &quot;The Chinese people have the best contraception in the world - their women are so ugly. I can&#x27;t understand why there are so many of them.&quot;

On &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; in 2013, he jokingly asked fellow contestant, Irish doctor Danielle Marr, &quot;you&#x27;re not carrying a bomb with you, are you?&quot;, when she draped her jumper over her head like a headscarf.

===Other TV work===
It was reported Atkinson was being brought in to support Iffy Onuora at Swindon Town in December 2005, and Atkinson and the club appeared to confirm this. It later transpired that Atkinson&#x27;s role was as part of a Sky One documentary about the club being filmed at the County Ground. In late January 2006, Atkinson and Swindon Town parted company, with Swindon manager Onuora citing interference as the main reason for stopping the documentary from going ahead. Just a week later the cameras turned up at Peterborough United&#x27;s ground, London Road, to begin filming for the documentary called &quot;Big Ron Manager&quot;. Peterborough were paid £100,000 to allow the filming to take place.

Atkinson spent the 2006 World Cup recording an amateur video blog and distributing it through the UK-based video sharing site SelfcastTV.com. He also provided commentary on the World Cup for the UK digital channel UKTV G2.

In 2006, Atkinson took part in the BBC Two programme &quot;Excuse My French&quot;. Atkinson, comedian Marcus Brigstocke and television presenter Esther Rantzen were immersed in the French language by staying in a remote town in the Provence region, being compelled to adapt to the French lifestyle and speak the language. His assignment at the end of the course was to provide a match analysis on a football match (Paris Saint-Germain – AS Monaco) in French for a French radio station.

He briefly made a return to television, appearing as a pundit on &quot;Football Italia&quot; broadcast on Bravo. He left the programme when Bravo lost the broadcast rights to Italian football.

Atkinson returned to the screen on 16 August 2009 on the Channel 4 reality show &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot;. When questioned about his controversial comments by swappee Tessa Sanderson, he refused to discuss it.

Atkinson brought out an autobiography &quot;60 Minutes with Ron Atkinson&quot;, in which he talks about his controversial comments and his football career.

Atkinson is currently a pundit on William Hill&#x27;s &quot;The Punt&quot; podcast and on Manchester United&#x27;s channel MUTV. In October 2019, he made a return to broadcasting, commentating on the six-a-side World Cup final in Crete, alongside UK commentator John Gwynne.

==Director of football==
On 23 January 2007, Atkinson returned to Kettering Town, the club he had managed more than thirty years previously, as director of football. It was announced on 19 April 2007 that he had left the post at the Conference North club following his disapproval over the sacking of manager Morell Maison.

==Leisure Leagues==
In December 2018, Atkinson was announced as an ambassador for worldwide six-a-side football firm Leisure Leagues; as part of the deal, he was to act as Director Of Football for the England six-a-side team.

<text>Portsea is a seaside suburb on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, approximately south-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Portsea recorded a population of 787 at the 2021 census.

Portsea is located on the opposite side of Port Phillip Bay. The suburb is located on the bay itself, but the locality boundaries stretch as far west as Point Nepean and incorporate a section of Bass Strait coastline. Portsea is the westernmost town on the Mornington Peninsula, and lies adjacent to Sorrento. It has one of the highest average incomes in Australia.

==History==

Portsea is named after Portsea Island which is an island incorporated by Portsmouth, England. Portsmouth is where the first settlers to Australia set sail from. Portsea Post Office opened on 10 February 1877 and closed in 1987.

In January 1948 the new St Mary&#x27;s School for Deaf Children was opened at Delgany, Portsea led by Kathleen Mary Egan. It was an initiative by the Dominican Sisters of Eastern Australia and the first to use oral techniques in Victoria.

OCS Portsea, an army establishment, was located just outside the town. The historic reserve became famous when Prime Minister of Australia Harold Holt disappeared while swimming inside the facility at Cheviot Beach on 17 December 1967 and was officially presumed dead two days later, although a formal inquest into his death did not take place until 2005.

==Present day==

Portsea was considered by many to be the hub of Melbourne&#x27;s recreational scuba diving activities. At one time there were as many as four dive shops in the main street of Portsea. Dive charter boats still travel from Portsea Pier to sites both inside Port Phillip and outside Port Phillip Heads, also known as &quot;The Rip&quot;.

The Portsea Pier is the home to the spectacular weedy sea dragon, as well as many other fish species, including numerous pufferfish. Boating traffic is frequent, and divers should be careful to avoid main boating routes. After dredging was done to deepen the entrance to the bay for shipping there was increased surge at Portsea Pier and within a year Portsea Beach was gone. Sandbags have been placed on the once picturesque beach to prevent further sand erosion.

Portsea Back Beach is an attraction in Portsea, due to its great surfing conditions and long stretch of sand. Portsea Surf Life Saving Club patrols the popular surf beach, as patrols are always needed during the summer period given the large waves and strong tides that are often present.

Corsair Rock, just at the entrance to Port Philip, is a well-known surf spot to locals and professional surfers. However, it is not advised to surf there unless you are an experienced surfer and, for safety, are accompanied by somebody in a boat nearby. It is considered a very dangerous location. The rip can run out as fast as 8-10 knots.

Golfers play at the revered Portsea Golf Club on Relph Avenue. The annual Portsea Polo event is held at Jarman Oval, near the former quarantine station on Point Nepean.

According to the 2016 Australian Bureau of Statistics Census, Portsea had 510 residents. Prominent residents include trucking magnate Lindsay Fox, Kate Baillieu and Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s grandson businessman David Calvert Jones, other well known residents are Eddie McGuire and Ron Walker.

==Traditional ownership==

The formally recognised traditional owners for the area in which Portsea is located are the Bunurong people. The Bunurong people are represented by the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation.

==Popular culture==

The Australian Crawl song &quot;Hoochie Gucci Fiorucci Mama&quot; (from the 1980 album &quot;The Boys Light Up&quot;) was written about Portsea.

<doc id="611738" wikidata="Q6282456" url="?curid=611738" title="Joseph Damer, 1st Earl of Dorchester">
<text>Joseph Damer, 1st Earl of Dorchester (12 March 1718 – 12 January 1798) was a country landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1741 to 1762 when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Milton. He was particularly associated with the reshaping of Milton Abbey and the creation of the village of Milton Abbas in Dorset, south-west England.

==Early life==
Damer was the eldest son of Joseph Damer MP of Winterbourne Came, and his wife Mary Churchill, daughter of John Churchill of Henbury, Dorset. He was from a wealthy family and his great-uncle was a money-lender in Ireland. He was baptised at the Holy Trinity Church, Dorchester and educated at Trinity College, Dublin in 1734–5. He married Lady Caroline Sackville, daughter of the 1st Duke of Dorset on 27 July 1742.

==Political career==
Damer was returned as Member of Parliament (MP) for Weymouth in the 1741 general election at the age of 22. He was then returned for Bramber in the 1747 general election and Dorchester in the 1754 general election. On 3 July 1753, Damer was created Baron Milton of Shrone Hill, County Tipperary, in the peerage of Ireland, which did not transfer him into the House of Lords, and then on 10 May 1762 Baron Milton of Milton Abbey in the peerage of Great Britain, which did.
==Building==
In 1751, Damer commissioned architect John Vardy to build him a London residence on Park Lane. He also purchased Milton Abbey and embarked on an ambitious project to reshape the surrounding valley. He replaced some existing buildings at the Abbey with a mansion house (designed initially by Vardy, then by Sir William Chambers, and completed by James Wyatt) for his own use. Landscape gardener Capability Brown was commissioned to remodel the surrounding grounds.

As a wealthy landowner Damer also set about the systematic removal of the neighbouring small town of Middleton and its residents. By 1780, most of the residents had been relocated to a new purpose-designed and built model village, Milton Abbas, approximately half a mile south-east of the Abbey; the town&#x27;s grammar school was moved to Blandford Forum, away. The original town was razed to the ground and landscaped, most of the site disappearing beneath a new ornamental lake.

==Later life and legacy==
Damer&#x27;s wife Lady Caroline died on 24 March 1775 at the age of 57, and he commissioned the Italian sculptor Agostino Carlini to create a magnificent tomb to her memory in the Abbey Church at Milton Abbey. In politics he had been associated with his brother-in-law, Lord George Sackville, and from 1768 to 1775 with Rockingham, but upon his wife&#x27;s death he spent a period in seclusion. In 1778 he returned to political life and took up a violent animosity against the Americans in their war of independence.

Damer was created first Earl of Dorchester and Viscount Milton on 18 May 1792. His income was variously estimated at between £15,000 and £30,000 a year. Horace Walpole in 1774 described him as &quot;the most arrogant and proud of men&quot;, and Wraxall wrote of him: &quot;At his seat of Milton Abbey in Dorsetshire, where he maintained a gloomy and sequestered splendour, analogous to his character and habits, he had made immense landed purchases, which, exhausting his pecuniary means, extensive as they were, reduced him to a species of temporary distress.&quot;

Damer died in 1798. He and his wife Caroline had three sons. The eldest, John, born in 1744, married the sculptor Anne Seymour Conway in 1767. She separated from him after seven years. Deep in debt, John Damer shot himself in 1776. The second son, George, born 1746, was also an MP and succeeded his father as Earl of Dorchester, but died unmarried in 1808, whereupon the title became extinct and the estate passed to his sister, Caroline.

Damer&#x27;s Park Lane mansion became known as The Dorchester. It was replaced by an Italianate building during the mid-19th century, but the name lives on as it is now the site of the Dorchester Hotel.

<text>The French Army, officially known as the Land Army (, ), is the principal land warfare force of France, and the largest component of the French Armed Forces; it is responsible to the Government of France, alongside the French Navy, French Air and Space Force, and the National Gendarmerie. The Army is commanded by the Chief of Staff of the French Army (CEMAT), who is subordinate of the Chief of the Defence Staff (CEMA), who commands active service Army units and in turn is responsible to the President of France. CEMAT is also directly responsible to the Ministry of the Armed Forces for administration, preparation, and equipment.

The French Army, following the French Revolution, has generally been composed of a mixed force of conscripts and professional volunteers. It is now considered a professional force, since the French Parliament suspended the conscription of soldiers.

According to British historian Niall Ferguson, out of all recorded conflicts which occurred since the year 387 BC, France has fought in 168 of them, won 109, lost 49 and drawn 10; this makes France the most successful military power in European history in terms of number of fought and won.

==History==

===Early history===
The first permanent army of France, which was paid with regular wages instead of being supplied by feudal levies, was established in the early 15th century under Charles VII. It was formed due to the need for reliable troops during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, though the Army was not disbanded because it saw continued use by the Kings of France following the conflict. Upon the outbreak of a conflict, an ordonnance would be issued to govern the length of service, composition and payment of units.

The Compagnies d&#x27;ordonnance formed the core of the Gendarme well into the 16th century, and were stationed throughout France and summoned into larger armies as needed. There was also provisions made for francs-archers, which was a militia of bowmen and foot soldiers raised from the non-noble classes, but the units were disbanded once war ended.

Meanwhile, the bulk of infantry was still provided by urban or provincial militias, which were raised from an area or city to fight locally and that were named for their recruiting grounds. Gradually, the units became more permanent, and in the late 15th century, Swiss instructors were recruited, and some of the &#x27;Bandes&#x27; (Militia) were combined to form temporary &#x27;Legions&#x27; of up to 9000 men. The men would be paid, contracted to fight and receive military training.

Henry II further regularised the French Army by forming standing infantry regiments to replace the Militia structure. The first of them (Régiments de Picardie, Piémont, Navarre and Champagne) were called &quot;Les Vieux Corps&quot; (The Old Corps). It was normal policy to disband regiments after a war was over as a cost-saving measure with the &quot;Vieux Corps&quot; and the French Royal Guard being the only survivors.Regiments could be raised directly by the King and so be called after the region in which they were raised or by the nobility and so called after the noble or his appointed colonel. When Louis XIII came to the throne, he disbanded most of the regiments in existence, leaving only the &quot;Vieux&quot; and a handful of others, which became known as the &quot;Petite Vieux&quot; and also gained the privilege of not being disbanded after a war.
In 1684, there was a major reorganisation of the French infantry and another in 1701 to fit in with Louis XIV&#x27;s plans and the War of the Spanish Succession. The reshuffle created many of the modern regiments of the French Army and standardised their equipment and tactics. The army of the Sun King tended to wear grey-white coats with coloured linings. There were exceptions and the foreign troops, recruited from outside France, wore red (Swiss, Irish etc.) or blue (Germans, Scots etc.) while the French Guards wore blue. In addition to the regiments of the line the &quot;Maison du Roi&quot; provided several elite units, the Swiss Guards, French Guards and the Regiments of Musketeers being the most famous. The white/grey coated French Infantry of the line &quot;Les Blancs&quot; with their Charleville muskets were a feared foe on the battlefields of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, fighting in the Nine Years&#x27; War, the Wars of Spanish and Austrian Succession, the Seven Years&#x27; War and the American Revolution.

===Wars of the Coalition===

The French Revolution caused the Army to lose most of its officers to aristocratic flight or the guillotine, and thus it became demoralised and ineffective. The revolutionary militias of Sans-culottes, and the bourgeoise National Guard formed the nucleus of the French Revolutionary Army alongside the remnants of the dissolved Royal French Army; it was created following the storming of the Tuileries palace, where the French National Guard joined the revolt, the loyal Swiss Guards were massacred and the King was deposed.

From 1792, the Revolutionary Army fought against a combination of European powers in the French Revolutionary Wars, with the state directing most of its industry and population to war efforts, marking the start of modern conscription in the world, it also allowed more flexible military strategies, setting way for Napoleonic warfare. Moreover, many noble officers were retired, decreasing stratification and increasing military specialism. These, and the extreme investments into war efforts allowed France to begin a steady advance into Europe.

Under Napoleon I, the French Imperial Army conquered most of Europe during the Napoleonic Wars. Professionalising again from the Revolutionary forces and using columns of attack with heavy artillery support and swarms of pursuit cavalry the French army under Napoleon and his marshals was able to outmanoeuvre and destroy the allied armies repeatedly until 1812. Napoleon introduced the concept of all arms Corps, each one a traditional army &#x27;in miniature&#x27;, permitting the field force to be split across several lines of march and rejoin or to operate independently. The &quot;Grande Armée&quot; operated by seeking a decisive battle with each enemy army and then destroying them in detail before rapidly occupying territory and forcing a peace.

In 1812, Napoleon invaded the Russian Empire with a new &quot;Grande Armee&quot;, seeking to remove their influence from eastern Europe and secure the frontiers of his empire and client states. The campaign initially went well, but the vast distances of the Russian Steppe and its cold winter forced his army into a shambling retreat preyed on by Russian raids and pursuit. This force could not be replaced and with the &quot;ulcer&quot; of the ongoing war in the Spanish peninsular against Britain and Portugal, the French Army was badly short of trained troops and French manpower was almost exhausted.

After Napoleon&#x27;s abdication and return, halted by an Anglo-Dutch and Prussian alliance at Waterloo, the French army was placed back under the restored Bourbon Monarchy. The structure remained largely unchanged and many officers of the Empire retained their positions.

===The 19th century===
The Bourbon restoration was a time of political instability with the country constantly on the verge of political violence. The army was committed to the restoration of Spanish monarchial absolutism in 1824. It achieved its aims in six months, but did not fully withdraw until 1828. By comparison with the earlier Napoleonic invasion, this expedition was rapid and successful.

Taking advantage of the weakness of the local bey, the French invasion of Algiers in 1830 again rapidly overcame initial resistance. The French government formally annexed Algeria but it took nearly 45 years to fully pacify the country. This period of French history saw the creation of the , which included the Légion étrangère. The Army was now uniformed in dark blue coats and red trousers, which it would retain until the First World War.

The news of the fall of Algiers had barely reached Paris in 1830 when the Bourbon Monarchy was overthrown and replaced by the constitutional Orleans Monarchy. During the July 1830 revolution, the Paris mobs proved too much for the troops of the and the main body of the French Army, sympathetic to the crowds, did not become heavily involved.

In 1848 a wave of revolutions swept Europe and brought an end to the French monarchy. The army was largely uninvolved in the street fighting in Paris which overthrew the King but later in the year troops were used in the suppression of the more radical elements of the new Republic which led to the election of Napoleon&#x27;s nephew as president.

The Pope had been forced out of Rome as part of the Revolutions of 1848, and Louis Napoleon sent a 14,000 man expeditionary force of troops to the Papal State under General Nicolas Charles Victor Oudinot to restore him. In late April 1849, it was defeated and pushed back from Rome by Giuseppi Garibaldi&#x27;s volunteer corps, but then recovered and recaptured Rome.

The French army was among the first in the world to be issued with Minié rifles, just in time for the Crimean War against Russia, allied with Britain. This invention gave line infantry a weapon with a much longer range and greater accuracy and lead to new flexible tactics. The French army was more experienced at mass manoeuvre and war fighting than the British and the reputation of the French army was greatly enhanced.

A series of colonial expeditions followed and in 1856 France joined the Second Opium War on the British side against China; obtaining concessions. French troops were deployed into Italy against the Austrians, the first use of railways for mass movement.

The French army was now considered to be an example to others and military missions to Japan and the emulation of French Zouaves in other militaries added to this prestige. However, an expedition to Mexico failed to create a stable puppet régime.

France was humiliated following its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, and while the army had far superior infantry weapons in the form of the Chassepot and Mitrailleuse, its tactics and artillery were inferior, and by allowing the Prussian Army to take the initiative, the French Army was rapidly bottled up into its fortress towns and defeated. The loss of prestige within the army lead to a great emphasis on aggression and close quarter tactics.

===The World Wars===

In August 1914, following the outbreak of the Great War, the French Armed Forces numbered some soldiers, and by the end of the war the French Army had called up 8,817,000 men, including 900,000 colonial troops; of these around 1,397,000 French soldiers were killed in action, mostly on the Western Front. French soldiers, at the beginning of the war, still wore the colourful uniforms of the Franco-Prussian War, with this conspicuous dress proving unsuited to the trenches and, accordingly, by 1915 the mostly blue and red peacetime uniforms had been replaced by &quot;bleu-horizon&quot; (light blue-grey), with the Adrian helmet in place of the kepi. The traditional of the French infantry continued to be worn in the trenches but in &quot;bleu-horizon&quot;. Colonial and North African soldiers adopted khaki uniforms.
At the beginning of the Battle of France the French Army deployed 2,240,000 combatants grouped into 94 divisions (of which 20 were active and 74 were reservists) from the Swiss border to the North Sea.These numbers did not include the Army of the Alps facing Italy or the 600,000 men dispersed through the French colonial empire. After defeat in 1940, the Vichy French regime was allowed to retain 100–120,000 Armistice Army personnel in unoccupied France, and larger forces in the French Empire: more than 220,000 in Africa (including 140,000 in French North Africa), and forces in Mandate Syria and French Indochina. Free French Forces, under the command of Charles de Gaulle, continued the fight with the Allies until the final defeat of the Axis in 1945.

===The Cold War===
After 1945, despite enormous efforts in the First Indochina War of 1945–54 and the Algerian War of 1954–62, both lands eventually left French control. French units stayed in Germany after 1945, forming the French Forces in Germany. 5th Armored Division stayed on in Germany after 1945, while 1st and 3rd Armoured Divisions were established in Germany in 1951. However NATO-assigned formations were withdrawn to fight in Algeria; 5th Armoured Division arrived in Algeria in April 1956. From 1948 to 1966, many French Army units fell under the integrated NATO Military Command Structure. Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces Central Europe was a French Army officer, and many key NATO staff positions were filled by Frenchmen. While an upper limit of 14 French divisions committed to NATO had been set by the Treaty of Paris, the total did not exceed six divisions during the Indochina War, and during the Algerian War the total fell as low as two divisions.

The Army created two parachute divisions in 1956, the 10th Parachute Division under the command of General Jacques Massu and the 25th Parachute Division under the command of General Sauvagnac. After the Algiers putsch, the two divisions, with the 11th Infantry Division, were merged into a new light intervention division, the 11th Light Intervention Division, on 1 May 1961.

During the Cold War, the French Army, though leaving the NATO Military Command Structure in 1966, planned for the defence of Western Europe. In 1977 the French Army switched from multi-brigade divisions to smaller divisions of about four to five battalions/regiments each. From the early 1970s, 2nd Army Corps was stationed in South Germany, and effectively formed a reserve for NATO&#x27;s Central Army Group. In the 1980s, 3rd Army Corps headquarters was moved to Lille and planning started for its use in support of NATO&#x27;s Northern Army Group. The Rapid Action Force of five light divisions, including the new 4th Airmobile and 6th Light Armoured Divisions, was also intended as a NATO reinforcement force. In addition, the 152nd Infantry Division was maintained to guard the S3 intercontinental ballistic missile base on the Plateau d&#x27;Albion.

In the 1970s–1980s, two light armoured divisions were planned to be formed from school staffs (the 12th and 14th). The 12th Light Armoured Division (12 DLB) was to have its headquarters to be formed on the basis of the staff of the Armoured and Cavalry Branch Training School at Saumur.

In the late 1970s an attempt was made to form 14 reserve light infantry divisions, but this plan was too ambitious. The planned divisions included the 102nd, the 104th, 107e, 108e, the , 110e, 111e, 112e, 114e, 115th, and 127th Infantry Divisions. From June 1984, the French Army reserve consisted of 22 military divisions, administering all reserve units in a certain area, seven &quot;brigades de zone de défense&quot;, 22 &quot;régiments interarmées divisionnaires&quot;, and the 152nd Infantry Division, defending the ICBM launch sites. The plan was put into action from 1985, and &quot;brigades de zone&quot;, such as the 107th Brigade de Zone, were created. But with the putting-in-place of the &quot;Réserves 2000&quot; plan, the brigades de zone were finally disbanded by mid-1993. 1st Army Corps was disbanded on 1 July 1990; 2nd Army Corps in August 1993.

====Decolonisation====

At the end of the Second World War, France was immediately confronted with the beginnings of the decolonisation movement. The French army, which had employed indigenous North African spahis and tirailleurs in almost all of its campaigns since 1830, was the leading force in opposition to decolonization, which was perceived as a humiliation. In Algeria the Army repressed an extensive rising in and around Sétif in May 1945 with heavy fire: figures for Algerian deaths vary between 45,000 as claimed by Radio Cairo at the time and the official French figure of 1,020.

The Army saw maintaining control of Algeria as a high priority. By this time, one million French settlers had established themselves, alongside an indigenous population of nine million. When it decided that politicians were about to sell them out and give independence to Algeria, the Army engineered a military coup that toppled the civilian government and put General de Gaulle back in power in the May 1958 crisis. De Gaulle, however, recognized that Algeria was a dead weight and had to be cut free. Four retired generals then launched the Algiers putsch of 1961 against de Gaulle himself, but it failed. After 400,000 deaths, Algeria finally became independent. Hundreds of thousands of Harkis, Muslims loyal to Paris, went into exile in France, where they and their children and grandchildren remain in poorly assimilated &quot;banlieue&quot; suburbs.

The Army repressed the Malagasy Uprising in Madagascar in 1947. French officials estimated the number of Malagasy killed from a low of 11,000 to a French Army estimate of 89,000.

===Recent history (1996–present)===
In February 1996, President Jacques Chirac began the transition of the Army to a professional force, and as part of the resulting changes, ten regiments were dissolved in 1997. On 1 July 1997, the specialized support brigades were transferred to various communes; Lunéville for signals, Haguenau for artillery and Strasbourg for engineers. On 1 September 1997, the 2nd Armoured Division left Versailles and was installed at Châlons-en-Champagne in place of the disbanded 10th Armoured Division. On 5 March 1998, in view of the ongoing structural adoptions of the French Army, the Minister of Defence decided to disband III Corps, and the dissolution became effective 1 July 1998. The headquarters transitioned to become Headquarters Commandement de la force d&#x27;action terrestre (CFAT) (the Land Forces Action Command).

During the professionalisation process, numbers decreased from the 236,000 (132,000 conscripts) in 1996 to around 140,000. By June 1999, the Army&#x27;s strength was 186,000, including around 70,000 conscripts. 38 of 129 regiments were planned to be stood down from 1997 to 1999. The previous structure&#x27;s nine &#x27;small&#x27; divisions and sundry separate combat and combat support brigades were replaced by nine combat and four combat support brigades. The Rapid Action Force, a corps of five small rapid-intervention divisions formed in 1983, was also disbanded, though several of its divisions were re-subordinated.

Opération Sentinelle is a French military operation with 10,000 soldiers and 4,700 police and gendarmes deployed since the aftermath of the January 2015 Île-de-France attacks, with the objective of protecting sensitive &quot;points&quot; of the territory from terrorism. It was reinforced during the November 2015 Paris attacks, and was part of a state of emergency in France due to continued terror threats and attacks.

==Organisation==
The organisation of the army is fixed by Chapter 2 of Title II of Book II of the Third Part of the Code of Defense, notably resulting in the codification of Decree 2000-559 of 21 June 2000.

In terms of Article R.3222-3 of the Code of Defence, the Army comprises:
* The Army Chief of Staff (Chef d&#x27;état-major de l&#x27;armée de Terre (CEMAT)).
* The army staff (&quot;l&#x27;état-major de l&#x27;armée de Terre&quot; or EMAT), which gives general direction and management of all the components;
* The Army Inspectorate (&quot;l&#x27;inspection de l&#x27;armée de Terre&quot;);
* The Army Human Resources Directorate (&quot;la direction des ressources humaines de l&#x27;armée de Terre&quot; or DRHAT);
* The forces;
* A territorial organisation (seven regions, see below)
* The services;
* The personnel training and military higher training organisms.

The French Army was reorganized in 2016. The new organisation consists of two combined divisions (carrying the heritage of 1st Armored and 3rd Armored divisions) and given three combat brigades to supervise each. There is also the Franco-German Brigade. The 4th Airmobile Brigade was reformed to direct the three combat helicopter regiments. There are also several division-level (&quot;niveau divisionnaire&quot;) specialized commands including Intelligence, Information and communication systems, Maintenance, Logistics, Special Forces, Army Light Aviation, the Foreign Legion, National Territory, Training.

===Arms of the French Army===
The Army is divided into arms (&quot;armes&quot;). They include the Infantry (which includes the Chasseurs Alpins, specialist mountain infantry, the &quot;Troupes de Marine&quot;, heirs of colonial troops and specialist amphibious troops), the Armoured Cavalry Arm (&quot;Arme Blindée Cavalerie&quot;), the Artillery, the Engineering Arm (&quot;l&#x27;arme du génie&quot;), &quot;Matériel&quot;, Logistics (&quot;Train&quot;) and Signals (&quot;Transmissions&quot;). Each brigade will have several &quot;armes&quot; within its units.

The French Foreign Legion was established in 1831 for foreign nationals willing to serve in the French Armed Forces. The Legion is commanded by French officers. It is an elite military unit numbering around 9,000 troops. The Legion has gained worldwide recognition for its service, most recently in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan since 2001. It is not strictly an &quot;Arme&quot; but a &quot;commandement particulier&quot;, whose regiments belong to several arms, notably the infantry and the engineering arm.

The Troupes de marine are the former Colonial Troops. They are the first choice units for overseas deployment and recruit on this basis. They are composed of Marine Infantry (&quot;Infanterie de Marine&quot;) (which includes parachute regiments such as 1er RPIMa and a tank unit, the &quot;Régiment d&#x27;infanterie-chars de marine&quot;) and the Marine Artillery (&quot;Artillerie de Marine&quot;).

The &quot;Aviation légère de l&#x27;armée de Terre&quot; (ALAT, which translates as Army Light Aviation), was established on 22 November 1954 for observation, reconnaissance, assault and supply duties. It operates numerous helicopters in support of the French Army, its primary attack helicopter is the Eurocopter Tiger, of which 80 were ordered. It is an &quot;Arme&quot; with a &quot;commandement particulier&quot;.

===Administrative services===
On the administrative side, there are now no more than one Direction and two services.

The Army Human Resources Directorate (DRHAT) manages human resources (military and civilian) of the Army and training.

The two Services are the service of ground equipment, and the integrated structure of operational maintenance of terrestrial materials (SIMMT, former DCMAT). This joint oriented service is responsible for project management support for all land equipment of the French army. The holding-operational equipment the Army is headed by the Service de maintenance industrielle terrestre (SMITer).

Historically there were other services of the Army who were all grouped together with their counterparts in other components to form joint agencies serving the entire French Armed Forces.

After the health service and the fuel service were both replaced respectively by the French Defence Health service and Military Fuel Service, other services have disappeared in recent years:
* In 2005, the Army historical service (SHAT) became the &quot;Land&quot; department of the Defence Historical Service (Service historique de la défense);
* In September 2005, the Central Engineering Directorate (Direction centrale du génie, DCG) was merged with its counterparts in the air force and the navy to form the Central Directorate of Defense Infrastructure (Direction centrale du service d&#x27;infrastructure de la défense);
* On 1 January 2006, the Central Directorate of Telecommunications and Informatics (DCTEI) was incorporated into the Central Directorate of the Joint Directorate of Infrastructure Networks and Information Systems (DIRISI);

The Army Commissariat was dissolved on 31 December 2009 and intégrated into the joint-service Service du commissariat des armées.

There is the Diocese of the French Armed Forces which provides pastoral care to Catholic members of the Army. It is headed by Luc Ravel and is headquartered in .

===Military regions===

On 24 July 1873, the French Parliament passed a law which created 18 military regions in metropolitan France. A 19th Army Corps was created in Algeria in September 1873 (see ). In 1905, the strength of the &quot;Troupes coloniales&quot; stationed in the 19 military districts of metropolitan France was reported at 2,123 officers and 26,581 other ranks. In 1946, following the Second World War ten military regions were created or recreated, in accordance with a decree of 18 February 1946. They included the 1st (Paris); 2e (Lille); 3e (Rennes); 4e (Bordeaux); 5e (Toulouse); 6e (Metz); 7e (Dijon); 8th (Lyon); the 9th (Marseille), and the 10th in Algeria. The 10th Military Region (France) supervised French Algeria during the Algerian War.

The Défense opérationnelle du territoire supervised reserve and home defence activities from 1959 to the 1970s. However, by the 1980s the number had been reduced to six: the 1st Military Region (France) with its headquarters in Paris, the 2nd Military Region (France) at Lille, the 3rd Military Region (France) at Rennes, the 4th Military Region (France) at Bordeaux, the 5th at Lyons and the 6th at Metz. Each supervised up to five &quot;division militaire territoriale&quot; – military administrative sub-divisions, in 1984 sometimes supervising up to three reserve regiments each. Today, under the latest thorough reform of the French security and defence sector, there are seven each with a territorial ground army region: Paris (or Île-de-France, HQ in Paris), Nord (HQ in Lille), Ouest (HQ in Rennes), Sud-Ouest (HQ in Bordeaux), Sud (HQ in Marseille), Sud-Est (HQ in Lyon), Est (HQ in Strasbourg).

==Personnel==
===Strength===

, the French Army employed 118,600 personnel; this includes the French Foreign Legion and Paris Fire Brigade. In addition, the reserves of the French Army consist of 25,000 personnel.

===Contracts===
Enlistment contracts for French army soldiers can range from a one to a five-year contract, which are all renewable. Meanwhile, Non-commissioned officers serve on permanent contracts, or exceptionally on renewable five years-contracts. Though NCO candidates are required to have a high school diploma that grants them access to university. &quot;École Nationale des Sous-Officiers d’Active (ENSOA)&quot;, Basic NCO school of 8 months, followed by combat school of 4 to 36 weeks depending on occupational specialty. A small number of NCO candidates are trained at the &quot;Ecole Militaire de Haute Montagne (EMHM)&quot; (High Mountain Military School). NCOs with the Advanced Army Technician Certificate (BSTAT) can serve as platoon leaders.

All Career officers serve on permanent contracts, with direct entry cadets with two years of Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles or a bachelor&#x27;s degree spend three years at École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr (ESM), and graduate as First Lieutenants. Direct entry cadets with a master&#x27;s degree spend one year at ESM, and graduate as First Lieutenants. Non-commissioned officers with three years in the army, spend two years at École militaire interarmes, and graduate as First Lieutenants. 50% of the commissioned officers in the French Army are former NCOs.

Contract officers serve on renewable contracts for a maximum of 20 years service. A bachelor&#x27;s degree is required. There are two different programs, combat officers and specialist officers. Officers in both programs graduate as Second Lieutenants and may reach Lieutenant Colonels rank. Combat officers spend eight months at ESM, followed by one year at a combat school. Specialist officers spend three months at ESM, followed by a year of on the job-training within an area of specialization determined by the type of degree held.

===Women===
Civilian women were hired by the French army in the First World War, thereby opening new opportunities for them, forcing a redefinition of military identity, and revealing the strength of anti-Republicanism within the Army. Officers by the 1920s accepted women as part of their institution.

===Code===
In 1999, the Army issued the &quot;Code of the French Soldier&quot;, which includes the injunctions:
===Ranks===

====Commissioned officer ranks====
The rank insignia of commissioned officers.
====Other ranks====
The rank insignia of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.
==Equipment==


==Uniforms==
In the 1970s, France adopted a light beige dress uniform which is worn with coloured kepis, sashes, fringed epaulettes, fourragères and other traditional items on appropriate occasions. The most commonly worn parade dress, however, consists of camouflage uniforms worn with the dress items noted above. The camouflage pattern, officially called Camouflage Centre Europe (CE), draws heavily on the colouration incorporated into the US M81 woodland pattern, but with a thicker and heavier striping. A desert version called the Camouflage Daguet has been worn since the Gulf War which consists of large irregular areas of chestnut brown and light grey on a sand khaki base.

The legionnaires of the Foreign Legion wear white kepis, blue sashes, and green and red epaulettes as dress uniform, while the Troupes de marine wear blue and red kepis and yellow epaulettes. The pioneers of the Foreign Legion wear the basic legionnaire uniform but with leather aprons and gloves. The Chasseurs Alpins wear a large beret, known as the &quot;tarte&quot; (the &quot;pie&quot;) with dark blue or white mountain outfits. The Spahis retain the long white cloak or &quot;burnous&quot; of the regiment&#x27;s origin as North African cavalry.

The military cadets of Saint-Cyr and the École Polytechnique retain their late 19th century dress uniforms. A dark blue/black evening dress is authorized for officers and individual branches or regiments may parade bands or &quot;fanfares&quot; in historic dress dating as far back as the Napoleonic period.

<text>Red Hill is a town on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, approximately south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Red Hill recorded a population of 1,009 at the 2021 census.

Red Hill is located in the hinterland of the Mornington Peninsula, about an hour&#x27;s drive south of Melbourne.

==History==

Red Hill was so named due to the rich, red soil colour found in this locality. The area now known as Red Hill contains land in three parishes: Kangerong, Wannaeue (only 626 acres) and Balnarring. Kangerong is north of Arthurs Seat Road and west of Red Hill Road, Wannaeue is west of Mornington-Flinders Road. The rest of Red Hill and Red Hill South are in Balnarring parish.

Many Red Hill roads are named after early pioneering families: Sheehan, McIlroy, Stanley, Bayne, Herriott, Oscar, Oscar, Lolat, Nash, Prossor, Perry (sic) and Callanan.

Red Hill Post Office opened on 1 August 1871.
A railway also operated here between 1921 and 1953, and was known as the Red Hill railway line.

==Today==

The town has an Australian rules football team, called the Hillmen, competing in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League. They won their first Division Two premiership back in 1990. Their most recent Division Two premiership was 2019, which saw them move into Division One in 2020.

A monthly community market is held from September through May. Patrons can still watch old-time games like Pétanque being played and smell the roasting of chestnuts. Other traditional Australian foods such as meat pies and jam donuts are also sold.

Since the 1970s, wineries have been established around Red Hill to take advantage of the microclimates that suits cool-climate grapes, and especially pinot noir. Strawberries, cherries and apples are also grown and available seasonally at the farm door.

<doc id="611744" wikidata="Q2104028" url="?curid=611744" title="Rosebud, Victoria">
<text>Rosebud is a seaside suburb on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, approximately south of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Rosebud recorded a population of 14,381 at the 2021 census.

Rosebud is wedged between the lower slopes of Arthurs Seat, the shores of Port Phillip and the plains of Boneo. It is a popular tourist resort with families who appreciate its sandy beaches and shallow waters.

==History==
On 2 June 1855, the cargo vessel &quot;Rosebud&quot;, owned by one of the colony&#x27;s best known pastoralists Edward Hobson, was washed over the large sandbars and onto the beach. The burgeoning community made off with the cargo of damask and household goods, but the wreck remained for many years as the locals slowly stripped its hull to use in the construction of houses. It became commonplace to call the area &quot;The Rosebud&quot; in reference to the ship, which was shortened to &quot;Rosebud&quot; as the last vestiges of the ship disappeared.

Officially the term Rosebud referred only to Rosebud Village, the blocks on the foreshore west of Eeling Creek (now an underground drain between Tom Salt Park and the camping ground). Land on the south side of &quot;the road to Portsea&quot; was described as being in Wannaeue; this was the name of the parish that extended south to Limestone Road. Today the name is recalled by a small street between Rosebud Parade and Ninth Avenue. The parish went from The Avenue to Government Road in Rye, but also included the Arthurs Seat pre-emptive right (now McCrae and Arthurs Seat). Peter Wilson gives much detail about the buyers of Rosebud Village allotments. Lime Land Leisure mentions a &quot;Mr Gomm, of whom little is known.&quot;

Allotment 20, between The Avenue and Parkmore Road, was not settled at the same time as the rest of the land to Boneo Road. This was supposedly due to an arrangement with Captain Henry Everest Adams, because he had been carrying convicts between Van Diemen&#x27;s Land and Melbourne. This transport was probably provided in 1840 when there was a drastic labour shortage in Melbourne. Isaac White who purchased allotment 19 (west to Adams Avenue), knew Adams and probably cared for the Captain&#x27;s wife while he was away at sea. He probably settled lot 19 on behalf of the Captain, who owned it by 1864. In the Argus of 12 March 1883, the Government advertised land in the village of Wannaeue on allotment 20, Wannaeue. No parish map has made mention of this village. The Adams family had a guest house, Hopetoun House, named after the Governor (a frequent guest), on the site of the car wash near McCrae Plaza. It was later renamed Merlyn Lodge. Robert Adams sold allotment 19 and the part north of Rosemore Road was subdivided but the ownership of the rest reverted to him in the Bust. Parkmore was built in 1896 by Albert Holloway and bought by the Clemengers in 1908.

The rest of the land to Boneo Road was granted to speculators. Allotment 18 (west to Jetty Road) became the property of Charles BLAKEY and then Robert White, after 18 February 1874, when the 152.5 acre allotment was advertised in the Argus. It was pointed out that a block, 66 x 330 feet, fronting the beach road, had been sold. As this was the only block separately owned for decades, it had to be Lot 86, which William Edwards mortgaged to Captain Adams in August 1878. As the land was of little value, it is strange that it was considered to provide enough security. Edwards borrowed £128 9/-, to be repaid with interest on 30 June 1880. McCrae was called Dromana until about 70 years ago, as the steamers had made Dromana&#x27;s location well known. Isobel Moresby said that Jack Jones had built a store on the corner in about 1900 but it was built about a decade earlier just after the &quot;Lake v Jones&quot; case.

Allotment 17 (west to Norm Clark Walk) came into the ownership of the Woolcotts. William Gomm was farming it in 1876 but returned to fishing when subdivision began. George and Susan Peatey were among the first buyers and the site for the state school was bought a few years later. Later residents were the McDowells after whom a street was named.

Allotments 16 and 15 (west to First Avenue) became the Clacton on-Sea estate. Allotment 14 (west to Boneo Road), granted to Hugh Glass of Flemington House, became small farms:Randall&#x27;s, then Rigg&#x27;s Hindhope, and Coupar&#x27;s The Thicket. By 1930 Hindhope Park was operating on the site of Rosebud Plaza. This had pine cabins for tourist accommodation. Some of the land was subdivided as the Hindhope Estate by 1920 but the tourist facility was still running in the mid-1960s. Walter and Charlie Burnham, fishermen from Sorrento, were two early purchasers on the estate in about 1914.(See Steve Burnam&#x27;s website for Vin Burnham&#x27;s story of the early days.)

Some of the famous residents (permanent and holiday) of Rosebud were Judith Mavis Cock (Judith Durham), Arthur Boyd and William John Ferrier. Judith spent her first six summers in the weatherboard house that stood on the west side of Durham Place. It is well documented on many websites that the 1995 Australian of the Year launched his fabulous career as a painter from the age of 16 while living in Rosebud from 1936-9 with his grandfather. One of young Arthur&#x27;s paintings was of the Burnhams&#x27; jetty at the end of Boneo Rd; it is reproduced in Peter Wilson&#x27;s &quot;On the Road to Rosebud&quot; alongside photos of the jetty. It has recently been discovered through title documents that the Boyd cottage is still standing at 62 Rosebud Pde. Ferrier won acclaim from all over Australia, and probably a job in the lighthouse branch, because of his heroic rescue of two of the seven crewmen of the La Bella at Warrnambool. He owned 858 Pt Nepean Rd for a time before moving to Queenscliff, naming his house in Beach St &quot;Rosebud&quot;. A descendant, Lewis Ferrier, jokingly called the Harbour Master at Queenscliff, gave the same name to his fishing boat. The Queenscliffe Maritime Museum website shows some paintings of ships that Ferrier did on the internal timber lining of the South Pile Lighthouse. Two farm homesteads remain among subdivision housing in Rosebud: 19 Mitchell St and 50 First Avenue. The latter was the Hindhope Villa on lots 95 and 96 of the Hindhope Estate (with 14 acres of grounds, as advertised in the Argus in 1914, which the land plan shows was west of Rosebrook St.)

Peter Wilson&#x27;s book, &quot;On the Road to Rosebud&quot;, gives excellent detail about Lot 18 (Henry Potton&#x27;s Farm, the suicide), Lot 17 (church, shops) and the Clacton-on-Sea estate.

The settlement remained rudimentary for many years. A school began operating in 1884 and moved into purpose-built premises three years later. The first store wasn&#x27;t opened until Welshman Jackie Jones began selling goods from an upturned boat in the late 1880s. Rosebud suffered from a lack of direct access to Melbourne. When a pier was finally built in 1888, it failed to extend into the deep water, so ferries and passenger ships from the metropolis had to dock at Dromana, a larger town about eight kilometres to the north. A road was formed by clearing a path at Anthony&#x27;s Nose, the point where Arthurs Seat (305 metres) meets the sea, halfway between Rosebud and Dromana. This, at last, gave Rosebud a road connection to surrounding towns and Melbourne. The Post Office then opened on 27 March 1889.

Although some companies offered ferry passengers a ride to Rosebud after they disembarked at Dromana, the bulk of the tourism trade went to Dromana and nearby Arthurs Seat, while Dromana remained the transportation hub for goods brought by road and sea.

In the early twentieth century, developers attempted to market Rosebud as an English-style seaside resort with the creation of the Clacton-on-Sea estate (today known as the &quot;Avenues&quot;). Vacant land was offered at just £2 per block in an effort to stimulate investment in the area. Take up was slow; society was not affluent enough to allow many of the middle class to own holiday homes so far from the city. This slow growth continued in the inter-war years; the township consisted of about ten shops and a Presbyterian church, built of wood on a single day in 1923. The first pub (the Rosebud Hotel) wasn&#x27;t built until 1939-40. Built in the prevailing art deco style, it remains the only pub in the town to this day.

Local businessmen had noticed a slowly growing phenomenon in the late 1930s and 1940s – the popularity of camping on the Rosebud foreshore; a cheap and interesting alternative to staying at guesthouses or hotels. After World War II, aided by the explosion in the number of people owning a car, camping at Rosebud over the Christmas-New Year holidays became a tradition for many Melbourne and Victorian families. The Rosebud Foreshore Committee was set up to administer the area and take bookings, which are now made twelve months in advance. In the 21st century, camping on the foreshore has taken on a cultural dimension and there are families who are fourth and even fifth generation visitors. Many Victorians reminisce about Summer holidays at Rosebud.

By the 1960s, Rosebud had become the largest town on the southern Peninsula, complete with a shopping centre and extensive sporting facilities. In time it became home to an increasing number of permanent residents, including &#x27;sea change&#x27; retirees. New housing estates have developed in the last five years, including the Peninsula Sands Estate in Rosebud South, home to many young families. The town&#x27;s shopping strip and most of its amenities are located on an extended strip of the Nepean Highway, which runs parallel to the beach. Rosebud proper extends from Lonsdale Street (the border with McCrae) for three kilometres to Boneo Road, where Rosebud West (Capel Sound) begins, while Rosebud South is a pocket of suburban streets directly south of Rosebud on the lower slopes of Arthur&#x27;s Seat. In 2016, after a controversial, and at times bitter balloting process, Mornington Peninsula Shire approved the name &quot;Capel Sound&quot; to replace &quot;Rosebud West&quot;. This was done to align with the Federal Government&#x27;s preference for town names without directional reference. It was also seen as an opportunity to improve the image of a suburb previously viewed as being somewhat less socially acceptable to the wider community. Some residents fancied the old name had a negative effect on land and property values. Other residents had grown up in Rosebud West. They expressed dismay and annoyance that their town&#x27;s traditional name might be taken from them. Nevertheless, after a long and at times painful campaign, the name &quot;Capel Sound&quot;, taken from a small bay area to the north of the shopping village, was the one which emerged to grace the town&#x27;s signboards for ever more.

Rosebud is shielded by camping grounds lined with banksias, tea tree and sheoak. During the summer months and as late as Easter campers can be found in these areas. Rosebud is one of the main towns on the Mornington Peninsula mostly because of its shopping areas. The Public Library is located at the Rosebud Central Shopping Centre. There is a shopping strip in Capel Sound, along Point Nepean Road.

==Culture==

Rosebud is popular for its weekend markets, including craft and vintage markets.
The foreshore area of Rosebud is one of the largest camping areas on the peninsula. During the summer months the populations of Rosebud and Dromana can double in size as many tourists stay within the camp grounds.

In 2015, Mornington Peninsula Shire completed the complete rebuild of Rosebud&#x27;s famous pier with Parks Victoria having spent about $3.5 million on its restoration.

Rosebud has hosted a parkrun on the foreshore since 17 February 2018.

In 2015 SJ Higgings was awarded the project to develop a low-rise apartment and retail units on the corner of Jetty and Nepean Roads.

==Climate==

Rosebud has a temperate coastal climate, and is usually several degrees cooler than Melbourne. The annual maximum mean temperature is 19.1 °C.

==Topography==

The town centre is located directly opposite the foreshore area and local beach.

==Sport==

The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League. They play at Olympic Park on Eastbourne Road. They have been champion of this league six times; in 1933, 1970, 1988, 1997, 2007 and 2015.

Rosebud is home to the Rosebud Heart Soccer Club which was established in 2010. The club has 180 junior players with 12 teams playing in the Football Victoria leagues and their own mini league Soccer Champs Program and a girls team that started in 2020. The club&#x27;s home ground is Olympic Park Recreation Reserve located on Besgrove Street.

Golfers play at the Eagle Ridge Golf Course on Browns Road, Rosebud, at the course of the Rosebud Country Club on Boneo Road, or at the Rosebud Park Public Golf Course on Elizabeth Drive.

Cycling is also a popular pastime in Rosebud and on the Mornington Peninsula. Point Nepean Road and the Nepean Highway are used by cyclists, as well as shared trails. The Mornington Peninsula Shire has constructed almost 80 kilometres of trails, including Bay Trail: Dromana to Sorrento, Melbourne Road Trail: Rye to Portsea and Western Port Bay Trail: Somerville to Balnarring.

==Schools==

There are several schools in the Rosebud area.

Primary schools include:
* Rosebud Primary School, established 1884

<doc id="611746" wikidata="Q3354420" url="?curid=611746" title="Loyal opposition">
<text>In parliamentary systems of government, the loyal opposition is the opposition parties in the legislature. The word &quot;loyal&quot; indicates that the non-governing parties may oppose the actions of the sitting cabinet while remaining loyal to the formal source(s) of the government&#x27;s power, such as the monarch or constitution. This loyalty allows for a peaceful transition of power and ongoing strengthening of democratic institutions. The idea of inquisitorial opposition that held the executive to account emerged in the United Kingdom.

==Concept==
The phrase is derived from John Hobhouse stating &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition&quot; in 1826 in a debate in the British parliament. It is intended to illustrate that Members of Parliament in a country&#x27;s legislature may oppose the policies of the incumbent government—typically comprising parliamentarians from the party with the most seats in the elected legislative chamber—while maintaining deference to the higher authority of the state and the larger framework within which democracy operates. The concept thus permits the dissent necessary for a functioning democracy without fear of being accused of treason.

As Michael Ignatieff, a former leader of the loyal opposition in the House of Commons of Canada, said in a 2012 address at Stanford University:
==Commonwealth realms==
The notion of a loyal opposition exists in various Commonwealth realms, being therein termed formally as &quot;His (or Her) Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition&quot; and informally as the &quot;Official Opposition&quot;, with the head of the largest opposition party—normally that which holds the second largest number of seats—designated as the &quot;Leader of Her (or His) Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition&quot;. This tradition emerged in the oldest of the Commonwealth realms—the United Kingdom—during the 18th century.

As a consequence of this parliamentary evolution, the sovereign&#x27;s right to the throne became more concrete, seeing the opposition scrutinise government legislation and policies, rather than engage in disputes between competing candidates for the Crown, each supported by different religious and economic groups. Further, the acceptance of such a thing as a loyal opposition in Parliament factored into the development of a rigid party system in the United Kingdom; the separation of Members of Parliament&#x27;s loyalty to the Crown from their opposition to the sovereign&#x27;s ministers eliminated the idea that there could only be one &quot;King&#x27;s Party&quot; and that to oppose it would be disloyal or even treasonous.

The concept of a loyal parliamentary opposition came to be rooted in the other countries due to their being former British colonies, to which British parliamentary institutions were transported. Thus, the phrase &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition&quot; existed in some Commonwealth realms even before the title of &quot;prime minister&quot;. Also, in federal countries, such as Canada and Australia, the phrase &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition&quot; is also employed in provincial or state legislatures, in the same fashion as in other parliaments.

<text>Yal Ayerdhal (26 January 195927 October 2015) was a French thriller and science fiction writer from Lyon. His later work preferred the thriller genre; &quot;Transparences&quot;, &quot;Resurgences&quot; and &quot;Rainbow Warriors&quot; play with various genres. &quot;Rainbow Warriors&quot; (published at the end of May 2013) flirts with political fiction with most protagonists being LGBTQ. He received the Grand Prix de l&#x27;Imaginaire in 2005 for &quot;Transparences&quot; and in 1993 for his novel &quot;Demain une oasis&quot;. He is considered one of the leading names in both genres. He shared the Prix Tour Eiffel with co-author Jean-Claude Dunyach for their 1999 novel &quot;Étoiles mourantes&quot;. He also received an award for his novel &quot;Parleur ou les chroniques d&#x27;un rêve enclavé&quot; and two for &quot;Transparences&quot;, a thriller. He also received the Cyrano award for lifetime achievement in the service of genre fiction and its actors.

Ayerdhal was born in the La Croix-Rousse area of Lyon. In addition to his own writing career he devoted part of his time to supporting aspiring young authors and, with Le droit du Serf, to struggle with copyright law exceptions in the service of authors.

Ayerdhal held genre fiction in the highest regard, not only as a tool for learning but as tool for the expression of one&#x27;s imagination and political inspirations. He frequently used a quote from French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre: &quot;The writer&#x27;s function is to make sure that no-one can ignore the world and that no-one can declare him/herself innocent.&quot;

<text>Capel Sound is a suburb on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Capel Sound recorded a population of 5,246 at the 2021 census.

A distinguishing landmark feature of Capel Sound is the Tootgarook Swamp, the largest example left of a shallow freshwater marsh in the Port Phillip bay region. The swamp is also described by Melbourne Water as a ground water dependent ecosystem. The 381 hectare swamp is found on the lower section of the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria, Australia. A large portion of the Tootgarook Swamp is zoned as residential and industrial, with roughly half of the actual swamp inside the green wedge and half within the urban growth boundary.

==History==

Rosebud West Post Office opened on 12 January 1938 and closed around 1996.

The town kept the name of the post office until an effort to change the name began in 2015. Proponents hoped a name change would distance the town from being seen as only an economically disadvantaged suburb of nearby Rosebud. About 56% of residents surveyed voted in favor of the name change. On 15 September 2016, Mornington Peninsula Shire Council officially changed the name from Rosebud West to Capel Sound. The new name was derived from an 1836 survey chart of the area, and was already in use by local businesses such as The Capel Sound Shopping Village.

<doc id="611752" wikidata="Q20053" url="?curid=611752" title="Ravioli">
<text>Ravioli (; : &quot;raviolo&quot;, ) are a type of stuffed pasta comprising a filling enveloped in thin pasta dough. Usually served in broth or with a sauce, they originated as a traditional food in Italian cuisine. Ravioli are commonly square, though other forms are also used, including circular and semi-circular (&quot;mezzelune&quot;).

Ravioli appear in the 14th-century cookbook &quot;The Forme of Cury&quot; under the name of &quot;rauioles&quot;.

==Etymology==
English and French borrowed the word &quot;ravioli&quot; from Italian in the 14th century. The ultimate origin of the word is uncertain. It is sometimes connected to the northern Italian word &quot;rava&quot;, &#x27;turnip&#x27;, supposing that the filling was made of turnips, but the earliest recipes, even Lenten ones, do not include turnips. Another theory connects it to a kind of cheese (related to modern Italian &quot;robiola&quot;), but that also appears unlikely.

==History==
Ravioli are mentioned in the personal letters of Francesco Datini, a merchant of Prato in the 14th century. In Venice, the mid-14th-century manuscript &quot;Libro per cuoco&quot; offers ravioli of green herbs blanched and minced, mixed with beaten egg and fresh cheese, simmered in broth and seasoned with &quot;sweet and strong spices&quot;. In Rome, ravioli were already well known when Bartolomeo Scappi served them with boiled chicken to the papal conclave of 1549.

==Overview==
Traditionally, ravioli are made at home. The filling varies according to the area where they are prepared. In Rome and Latium, the filling is made with ricotta cheese, spinach, nutmeg and black pepper. In Sardinia, ravioli are filled with ricotta and grated lemon rind.

Modern ravioli are also mass-produced by machine.

==Around the world==
In Europe and the United States, fresh-packed ravioli have several weeks of shelf life. Canned ravioli were pioneered by the Italian Army in the First World War and were popularized by Heinz and Buitoni in the UK and Europe, and Chef Boyardee in the United States. Canned ravioli may be filled with beef, processed cheese, chicken, or Italian sausage and served in a tomato, tomato-meat, or tomato-cheese sauce. Toasted ravioli (ravioli that have been breaded and deep-fried) was developed in St. Louis, Missouri, and is a popular appetizer and snack food.

Ravioli are commonly encountered in the cooking of Nice, the broader Côte d&#x27;Azur, and the surrounding regions in the south of France. The contents of these vary greatly, but most idiosyncratic to the region is the use of leftover daube meat. Miniaturized cheese-filled ravioli, locally called &quot;raviole du Dauphiné&quot;, are a specialty of the Drôme department in the Rhône-Alpes region, particularly the commune of Romans-sur-Isère, and are frequently served &quot;au gratin&quot;.

Ravioli filled with halloumi are a traditional pasta dish of Cypriot cuisine. They are boiled in chicken stock and served with grated halloumi and dried mint on top.

==In other cultures==
In Turkey, &quot;manti&quot;, similar to ravioli, is a popular dish. It is stuffed with spiced meat and served with paprika sauce and yoghurt. Similar dishes in China are &quot;jiaozi&quot; or wonton.

In India, a popular dish called &quot;gujhia&quot; is similar to ravioli. However, it is prepared sweet, with a filling of dry fruits, sugar, and a mixture of sweet spices, then deep-fried in vegetable oil. Different stuffings are used in different parts of India. 

Jewish cuisine includes various similar dishes. Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine features &quot;kreplach&quot;, which are pockets of meat or other fillings encased in egg-pasta dough and simmered in chicken soup. In the Israeli cities of Safed and Tiberias, there is a comparable dish called &quot;calsones&quot; (pronounced &quot;caltzones&quot;). These are pockets filled with &quot;tzfatit&quot;, a locally-made sheep’s milk cheese. This dish originated in Jewish communities in Spain and Italy, with migrating Jews bringing it to Syria and then Israel, where it became a Shavuot staple.

A similar Middle Eastern dish called &quot;shishbarak&quot; contains pasta filled with minced beef meat and cooked in hot yogurt.

In Argentina, &quot;sorrentinos&quot; are large ravioli typically stuffed with meat and cheese and served with a tomato and meat sauce.

<text>Rye is a seaside suburb on the Mornington Peninsula in, Victoria, Australia, approximately south of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Rye recorded a population of 9,438 at the 2021 census.

Rye&#x27;s beach, on the eastern side of Port Phillip, is popular with swimmers, fishermen, yachtsmen, and kitesurfers. Its ocean beach (which is not patrolled) is also popular with surfers and divers. Rye is in the traditional country of the Boon wurrung (Bunurong) people of the Kulin nation.

==History==

Rye was proclaimed a town on 26 February 1861 and is partly in the parish of Wannaeue but mainly in the parish of Nepean, which is west of Government Road and Weeroona Street. The township went south to the southern boundary of the cemetery, with its east and west boundaries being Weir Street and Dundas Street. Suburban lots of 21 to 98 acres extended west to French St and south to a point just past the Golf Pde corner. Most of these suburban lots were bought by W.A.Blair, a Melbourne Lime Merchant.
He also received grants for much land in the parishes of Wannaeue and Nepean. His objective was to establish a monopoly, which was only rivalled by John Cain. Many who had been engaged in the production of lime, such as Nathan Page, Tom Bennett, Edward Russell, Harold Bainbridge and Spunner, were dispossessed of their kilns by Blair in about 1867. Lime could be quarried throughout the area west of Boneo Road. Many golf courses and the Peninsula Hot Springs are on the sites of Limeburners&#x27; properties between Browns and Limestone Roads. A reproduction of a lime kiln is displayed on the foreshore just east of White Cliff. They were built into the side of a hill so that firewood and napped limestone could be loaded from above.

The demand for rye lime declined in 1879 with the opening of the Lilydale quarry. However, the Sullivans continued production south of Weeroona Road, with operations later managed by Antonio Albress. Blair&#x27;s large kiln remained active at the Fire Station site. Ben Stenniken and James Sullivan became the leaders in a new industry, firewood. Ti tree had spread inland from the foreshore as the she-oaks had almost completely disappeared, having fired the kilns for decades. Cut into 2 foot 6 inch sections, the ti tree was shipped in former limecraft to heat bakers&#x27; ovens in Melbourne. 

Jim Brown and the Jennings family moved into farms near Browns Road just before and after 1910, the latter on former Blair land. Brown set about dealing with rampant ti tree and rabbits, while the Jennings family moved into dairy farming. Another feature on land granted to Blair was the McDonalds&#x27; Rye Golf Links, enclosed by Dundas Street and Golf Parade. (Sources: Parish and Rye Township maps, Lime Land Leisure.)

The Post Office opened on 18 January 1858 as Tootgarook and was renamed Rye in 1870. 
==Today==

In 2010 the Rotary Club merged with the Rosebud Rotary Club. These organisations are heavily involved within the local community. 
Rye also has a historical society which operates from the Old School House in Collingwood Street. 
Rye&#x27;s summer carnival is located beside the pier carpark. The town is extremely popular during vacation periods and has a varied selection of eating establishments.

The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League.

Golfers play at the course of the Moonah Links on Peter Thomson Drive or at The Dunes Golf Links on Browns Road.

When it opened in 2004, Rye Skatepark was the first cradle skate bowl built in the Southern Hemisphere. It remains popular with skateboarders.

==Rye Pier==

Rye Pier is a popular recreational scuba diving shore dive site inside Port Phillip. The pier can house seahorses, stingrays, spider crabs, squid, scallops and octopuses and Australian fur seals. The wreck of the wooden sailing ketch Eivion lies 115 metres to the east of Rye Pier. The shipwreck remains of the wooden schooner Barbara lie 240 metres to the west of Rye Pier.

Rye Pier is also the location of an annual giant spider crab mass aggregation. In late May-June great spider crabs migrate along through the area.

==Fire Brigade==

The Rye Fire Brigade is located in Collingwood Street, just behind the Bowls Club.
The brigade has 3 appliances, a Pumper – used for structure fires, and Tanker – used for grass and scrub fires, and a Salvage – used as a support for both pumper and tanker.

The fire brigade is volunteer-based and responds to calls in the Rye area and surrounding areas. Rye Brigade played important roles during Black Saturday sending trucks to Narre Warren, Kinglake, Longwarry and sending crews to Wilson Promontory.

<doc id="611758" wikidata="Q7398603" url="?curid=611758" title="Safety Beach, Victoria">
<text>Safety Beach is a seaside suburb on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south of Melbourne&#x27;s city centre, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Safety Beach recorded a population of 6,328 at the 2021 census.

Safety Beach occupies slightly less than half the area of land between the foothills of Mount Martha and Arthurs Seat and borders Port Philip Bay to its west.

Martha Cove is a large inland harbour and residential development in Safety Beach. It was named after its location in the cove at the foot of Mount Martha. The project, which began in 2004, was initially heavily protested by residents. After experiencing considerable financial difficulties, Martha Cove recovered and became a thriving residential community.
Golfers play at the course of the Mount Martha Valley Golf Club on Country Club Drive, or at the Safety Beach Golf Course nearby.

Previously, an abattoir existed nearby to slaughter local farm animals for their meat. Blood and offal from early abattoir operations were dumped into the Sheepwash and Dunns Creeks, and carried by these creeks into Dromana Bay at Safety Beach. 

Consequently, when lots of sharks were attracted here, people joked and called Safety Beach “Shark Bay” for some years. Eventually the abattoir’s operations were properly cleaned up by Health Department regulations, and Safety Beach never had its name changed from the original one ‘Safety Beach’ given by John Aitken in 1836. 

==Beach activities==

The area has a calm, sandy bay and a swimming beach which is popular for boating. The foreshore reserve has an attractive children&#x27;s playground and BBQ areas with shading. 
Safety Beach Sailing Club was established in 1967. Safety Beach Sailing Club has hosted many State and National titles and SBSC sailors are recognised by the sailing community for their excellence in sailing with success at regattas and at State, National and International level.

==History==

Many believe Safety Beach to originally have been named &#x27;Shark Bay&#x27;, but no official maps have this name. The area of port Phillip bay is called Dromana Bay and the first domestic subdivision around 1912 was called Dromana estate and was the blocks of land off Marine Drive and Dromana Parade from Pt Nepean road to around Dunns creek. 
Safety Beach gets its name from a journal entry of a trading vessel that run aground in storm and they were able to off load the livestock safely.
In 1841, Hugh Jamieson purchased , or eight square miles, of land from the Crown for £1 an acre under the terms of the short-lived Special Survey regulations.
The purchase included all of the present suburb of Safety Beach . The area is known as Jamieson&#x27;s Special Survey in cadastral surveys. The survey extended east as far as Bulldog Creek Rd. Henry Dunn had leased the Survey from 1846 until 1851 and was succeeded by tenants such as the Griffith, Eaton, Peatey, McLear, Clydesdale, Wilson, Cottier and Gibson families, which were involved with the History of Dromana. Edward Louis Tassell leased the northern for some time near the creek that is named after him.

Big Clarke later owned the survey, and sold the northern 1000 or so acres to John Vans Agnew Bruce. Maria Stenniken, who married Godfrey Burdett Wilson, used to work at Bruce&#x27;s house as a servant during the summer. At the eastern end of the Survey, many of the pioneers worked at goldmining for Bernard Eaton. (Sources: A Dreamtime of Dromana, Lime Land Leisure, Rate records, 1888 Post office directory.)

Safety Beach Post Office opened on 1 October 1953 and closed in 1974.

Shoreham is in the southern Mornington Peninsula region on the Western Port, located on its shores around the mouth of Stoney Creek. It is a coastal recreation resort rich in artistic history, notable for its pine-covered cliffs, foreshore reserve, and Honeysuckle Beach.

==History==

Shoreham began as a port for timber exports from the surrounding area. Early reports of the area suggested the region was &quot;thick with honeysuckle and sheoak&quot; and early settlers in the Balnarring and Hastings region were involved in wattle bark stripping and cutting piles and sleepers for shipping to Melbourne via the town.
Shoreham Post Office opened on 1 October 1881.

==Artists==

Shoreham has a rich artistic history in Australian art, as a place where artists have resided and painted, most notably Clifton Pugh, Colin Colahan, John Perceval and Charles Blackman. Several homes and paintings bear testimony to their work. There is also iron work by Matcham Skipper and frescos by Clifton Pugh.

==Today==

Shoreham today is a small coastal town containing a post office, tennis courts, community hall and CFA, picnic and barbecue facilities, and a boat launch access over Honeysuckle beach. Whilst predominantly the refuge of private homes and farms, there are various accommodation options such as B&amp;Bs, a caravan park and camping sites.

Shoreham is served by the bus route 782 bus route operated by Ventura Bus Lines between Frankston railway station and Flinders. The town is also within 15 minutes driving distance of the Stony Point railway line, which connects travellers to the metropolitan Melbourne railway network.

<text>Somers is a town on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Somers recorded a population of 1,857 at the 2021 census.

Somers is located in the south-eastern corner of the Mornington Peninsula, on the shores of Western Port.

==History==

Originally known as Balnarring East, the town was renamed for a popular former Governor of Victoria who set up the local Lord Somers Camp. The subdivision of Somers began in 1925, whilst the Boulevard Cafe &amp; Post Office commenced business in 1927, the address then still being Balnarring East. After much correspondence with the Education Dept. the Palm Beach School No. 4458 opened 1929. The renaming of the town occurred in 1930. Despite a few very small land subdivisions for housing, Somers has not seen any major development since the 1920s and has retained much of its remnant bush land on the foreshore. Initially as the land had been used for grazing, the estates were bare until local residents led by local store-keeper Ron Stone planted many trees throughout the area.

==Geography==

Somers lies on an area of land on the south-eastern point of the Mornington Peninsula, where to the south, it borders Western Port. The town of Cowes on Phillip Island can be seen from any beach in Somers in most weather conditions. There are two large sandbars between Somers and Phillip Island, and between them is a deep shipping channel. At low tide both sandbars are often visible. To the north, inland, lies extensively cleared lands used for agriculture. Further north lie the towns of Bittern and Hastings which host many commercial services used by Somers residents. To the east is the suburb and military base, HMAS Cerberus. Its compound bordering Somers is entirely bushland and used for training exercises. Where the base meets Somers at its coastline, beaches are closed and the land consists mainly of bushy coastal forests. To the west, separated from the Lord Somers Camp and the Coolart Wetlands, lies the locality of Balnarring. Somers&#x27; geography slopes gently down towards the water&#x27;s edge, interrupting line of sight to Mt. Dandenong and as a result, television reception can be difficult when using a small antenna. Local knowledge is advisable for good reception.

==Recreation==

Somers is perhaps best known for its yacht club and sailing facilities. The waters offshore from Somers, neighbouring Balnarring and Merricks Beaches, Flinders and Shoreham, and the body of water between the Mornington Peninsula and Philip Island are some of the most ideal and safest regions for sailing of all types in Australia. On most days many sailboats, mainly catamarans, can be seen in the waters of Western Port Bay participating in several races that are held during good sailing conditions, usually on weekends. The tidal inlet of Merricks Creek at low tide is one of the best places around Melbourne and the Mornington Peninsula for skiffle boarding, while the South Beach (actually to the east of the main beach) is tucked away behind the belt of foreshore bushland that is Somers Foreshore Reserve, and is enjoyed mainly by local residents, while the main beach, Somers Beach, is home to one of the major yacht clubs in Western Port, Somers Yacht Club. Walking is also popular in Somers as good quality sealed and unsealed pathways exist along roadsides and in parklands, where walkers enjoy native bush land, wildlife and views of Western Port.

===Beaches===

The coastline of Somers has three distinguishable beaches, South Beach, Somers Beach and the tidal flats of Merricks Creek Inlet.

At certain times of the year these beaches can be covered with dried seaweed from the extensive marine vegetation under the waters of Western Port, however when the seaweed is not in season, all of Somers beaches boast clean sand. The South Beach has an intricate system of rock pools, this is both of great interest to beachcombers, and something of a curse, as the beach is a difficult place to swim. The Merricks Creek Inlet is a tidal creek that flows with the tides of Western Port. About 50 cm below the surface of the sandbed of the creek lies a darker sand that gives off a hydrogen sulphide smell when disturbed. Sand all these beaches is generally fine grain mixed with crushed sea shells. Small reefs exist in a few places and can be seen at low tide, but these are only rocky reefs incapable of supporting coral. At low tide these reefs can make navigation near the beach difficult for watercraft and are clearly marked with buoys. A succession of big storm tides came in on 24 March, 25 March, 22 April, 23 April and 15 June 2011, severely eroding the sand dunes east the Merricks Creek. In 2012, the wooden wall that had fixed that path of the Merricks Creek since 1974, was taken down, as it was deemed unsafe and not adequately performing its job anymore. Starting in July 2012 and finishing in September 2012, a new rock wall was built, to fix the creek on a path straight into Westernport. For the three and a half years the wall has been in place, a noticeable buildup of sand has occurred east of the wall, while considerable erosion has occurred west of the wall. In November 2015, the entrance to the Merricks Creek was filled in with a sand groyne, as a short-term solution to the constant hydrogen sulphide odour caused by the breakdown of sea grasses within the creek. As of June 2016, the sand groyne is still in place, and as such the surrounding beaches have benefitted with the buildup of sand.

===Erosion===
Somers has an interesting history revolving around its Main Beach. Erosion of the beaches around Somers, particularly around the Yacht Club has been a major concern for foreshore communities and residents of Parklands Avenue and The Promenade over the last few decades. Several decades ago, Somers Yacht Club was situated next to the beach with a depression (where once the Merricks Creek flowed separating it from the sands of the beach of Westernport Bay. Yachts and sailboats were wheeled and carried over many sand dunes to reach the sandy beaches to launch them to sail.

Yet today, the Yacht Club boasts Seaside views and in 2001 had its roof blown off and severely damaged in a large storm after decades of erosion drew a new coastline almost to the doorstep of the Yacht Club. Seawalls constructed of natural rocks have been strategically placed around the coastline of Somers Beach complemented by wooden seawalls and many small wave-breaks that have all slowly succumbed to the waves of the sea. Experts such as marine geomorphologists have assessed the erosion situation, however no definitive explanation can be found as to why the erosion occurs. The most popular theory is that of Longshore Drift, where successive &quot;waves&quot; of sand pass Somers, with sand build up when such a wave passes, and erosion at other times. A commonly held view is that the man-made channelisation of Merricks Creek has upset the delicate equilibrium of the coastline. In recent years the erosion has slowed and almost stopped, and experts predict it could be due to a major decrease in easterly winds, tending to slow the effects of longshore drift, thus the erosion. An alternative view is that the decrease in rainfall has limited the period when Merricks Creek is flowing into the sea, thus allowing sand build up at the mouth of the creek, which then allows the sand build up to propagate along the beach. Between 2011 and 2015, the beaches of Somers have lost a considerable amount of dunage and sand, seen most evidently west of the Wits End Creek and west of Merricks Creek. These areas have lost up to as much as six to eight metres of dunes in a five-year period. As recently as May 2015, the beach west of Merricks Creek lost three metres of dunes in as little as three days, caused by gale-force winds, large swell and king tides.

==Community==
Somers has a Primary School, a Kindergarten,a caravan park, a General Store (&quot;The Somers General&quot;),a CFA (Country Fire Authority) Fire Station, tennis courts, a cricket ground, The Coolart Wetlands, Lord Somers Camp, the Education Department School Camp (originally built for the RAAF, then used to accommodate immigrants) and various parks, gardens and reserves. There are no shopping strips or centres and no supermarkets. The newly refurbished General Store and cafe has become very popular with both local residents and visitors as a pleasant meeting /social venue for a meal or coffee. It also carries sufficient groceries etc. so that it is almost possible not to have to travel to nearby Balnarring or Hastings for food. However, if other forms of commercial service are required, Balnarring and Hastings are usually the main places to go.

Somers is also home to The Somers Yacht Club which houses a Sea Rescue Facility, who contribute greatly to the safety of Western Port Bay through the use of rescue boats sent out to help capsized skippers and crew, or those in other forms of trouble, whilst the Yacht Club is open.

==Environment==

It is not unusual in Somers to see some (introduced) koalas and the suburb is well known for its Koala Walk. The distinctive growl of Koalas can often be heard in the town. Travellers are advised to take care, as koalas frequently cross local roads, and show little road sense. Occasionally echidnas have been seen in the area around The Promenade. Bushy-tail and ring- tail Possums are commonplace, and can often be seen soon after nightfall, scurrying along powerlines and thus silhouetted against the night sky.

<text>An International Nonproprietary Name (INN) is an official generic and nonproprietary name given to a pharmaceutical substance or an active ingredient, encompassing compounds, peptides and low-molecular-weight proteins (e.g., insulin, hormones, cytokines), as well as complex biological products, such as those used for gene therapy. INNs are intended to make communication more precise by providing a unique standard name for each active ingredient, to avoid prescribing errors. The INN system was initiated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1953.

Having unambiguous standard names for each pharmaceutical substance (standardization of drug nomenclature) is important because a drug may be sold under many different brand names, or a branded medication may contain more than one drug. For example, the branded medications Celexa, Celapram and Citrol all contain the same active ingredient whose INN is citalopram. The antibacterial medication known as co-trimoxazole as well as those under the brand names Bactrim and Septran all contain two active ingredients easily recognisable by their INN: trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. 

The WHO publishes INNs in English, Latin, French, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese, and a drug&#x27;s INNs are often cognate across most or all of the languages, with minor spelling or pronunciation differences, for example: &quot;paracetamol&quot; (en) &#x27; ([[Neo-Latin|la]]),&#x27; (fr) and (ru). An established INN is known as a &quot;recommended&quot; INN (rINN), while a name that is still being considered is called a &quot;proposed&quot; INN (pINN).

National nonproprietary names such as British Approved Names (BAN), Dénominations Communes Françaises (DCF), Japanese Adopted Names (JAN) and United States Adopted Names (USAN) are nowadays, with rare exceptions, identical to the INN.

==INN stems==
Each drug&#x27;s INN is unique but may contain a stem that is shared with other drugs of the same class. In this context, a stem is a syllable (or syllables) created to evoke in the name the pharmacological mechanism of action or the chemical structure of the substance. Stems are mostly placed word-finally (suffixes), but in some cases word-initial stems (prefixes) are used. For example, the beta blocker drugs propranolol and atenolol share the stem &quot;-olol&quot; (as a suffix), and the benzodiazepine drugs lorazepam and diazepam share the stem &quot;-azepam&quot; (also a suffix) The list of stems in use are collected in a publication informally known as the &quot;Stem Book&quot;.

Some examples of stems are:
* &quot;-anib&quot; for angiogenesis inhibitors (e.g. pazopanib)
* &quot;-anserin&quot; for serotonin receptor antagonists, especially 5-HT2 antagonists (e.g. ritanserin and mianserin)
* &quot;-arit&quot; for antiarthritic agents (e.g. lobenzarit)
* &quot;-ase&quot; for enzymes (e.g. alteplase)
* &quot;-azepam&quot; or &quot;-azolam&quot; for benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam and alprazolam)
* &quot;-caine&quot; for local anaesthetics (e.g. procaine )
* &quot;cef-&quot; for cephalosporins (e.g. cefalexin)
* &quot;-coxib&quot; for COX-2 inhibitors, a type of anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. celecoxib)
* -&quot;grel&quot;- or -&quot;grel&quot; for platelet aggregation inhibitors (e.g. anagrelide, cangrelor, clopidogrel)
* &quot;-mab&quot; for monoclonal antibodies (e.g. infliximab); see Nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies
* &quot;-meran&quot; for messenger RNA products (e.g. tozinameran and elasomeran)
*-- or &quot;nab&quot;- for cannabinoid receptor agonists (e.g. cannabidiol, dronabinol, nabilone)
*&quot;-olol&quot; for beta blockers (e.g. atenolol)
* &quot;-pril&quot; for angiotensing converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g. captopril)
* &quot;-sartan&quot; for angiotensin II receptor antagonists (e.g. losartan)
* &quot;-tinib&quot; for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. imatinib)
* &quot;-vastatin&quot; for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, a group of cholesterol-lowering agents (e.g. atorvastatin and simvastatin )
* &quot;-vir&quot; for antivirals (e.g. remdesivir and ritonavir)
** for antiretroviral protease inhibitors (e.g. darunavir)
** -&quot;ciclovir&quot; for bicyclic heterocycle antivirals (e.g. aciclovir and famciclovir)

== School of INN ==

The School of INN is a WHO International Nonproprietary Name Programme initiative launched in 2019, which aims to provide information to pharmacy, medical and health students, as well as health professionals and other stakeholders on how an INN is designed and constructed.

Users can take self-administered courses on several topics using this free and open source learning platform. For example, the course An Introduction to Drug Nomenclature and INN provides the user with a general overview of drug nomenclature and how INN are obtained and constructed. The course Learning Clinical Pharmacology (ATC classification, INN system) provides the student with the first steps to learn pharmacology using INN stems.

Registered students can take other courses provided by the School of INN, such as the &quot;Stem in a pill&quot; course, in which each topic or course contains information correlating INN and pharmacology for a given stem, including indications, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, contraindications, and drug interactions for the drugs sharing the stem.

There is also a &quot;How to ...&quot; section about INN Programme services and &quot;MedNet INN&quot; which enables users to carry out searches in the INN database to retrieve information on INN, its chemical information and ATC codes amonsgt other things.

The School of INN has created pilot sites in collaboration with several Universities around the globe: University of the Western Cape(South Africa), University of Eastern Piedmont (Italy), Université Grenoble Alpes (France) and University Ramon Lull and University of Alcalá in Spain. These pilot sites are involved in disseminating the use of INN, teaching based on INN and related research activities.

== Linguistics ==

=== Stems and roots ===
The term &quot;stem&quot; is not used consistently in linguistics. It has been defined as a form to which affixes (of any type) can be attached. Under a different and apparently more common view, this is the definition of a root, while a stem consists of the root plus optional derivational affixes, meaning that it is the part of a word to which inflectional affixes are added. INN stems employ the first definition, while under the more common alternative they would be described as roots.

=== Translingual communication ===
Pharmacology and pharmacotherapy (like health care generally) are universally relevant around the world, making translingual communication about them an important goal. An interlingual perspective is thus useful in drug nomenclature. The WHO issues INNs in English, Latin, French, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese. A drug&#x27;s INNs are often cognates across most or all of the languages, but they also allow small inflectional, diacritic, and transliterational differences that are usually transparent and trivial for nonspeakers (as is true of most international scientific vocabulary). For example, although &quot;ibuprofenum&quot; (la) has an inflectional difference from &quot;ibuprofen&quot; (en), and although &quot;ibuprofène&quot; (fr) has a diacritic difference, the differences are trivial; users can easily recognize the &quot;same word&quot;. Although &quot;Ибупрофе́н&quot; (ru) and &quot;ibuprofen&quot; (en) have a transliteration difference, they sound similar, and for Russian speakers who can recognize Latin script or English speakers who can recognize Cyrillic script, they look similar; users can recognize the &quot;same word&quot;. Thus, INNs make medicines bought anywhere in the world as easily identifiable as possible to people who do not speak that language. Notably, the &quot;same word&quot; principle allows health professionals and patients who do not speak the same language to communicate to some degree and to avoid potentially life-threatening confusions from drug interactions.

=== Spelling regularization ===
To facilitate the translation and pronunciation of INN, &quot;f&quot; should be used instead of &quot;ph&quot;, &quot;t&quot; instead of &quot;th&quot;, &quot;e&quot; instead of &quot;ae&quot; or &quot;oe&quot;, and &quot;i&quot; instead of &quot;y&quot;; the use of the letters &quot;h&quot; and &quot;k&quot; should be avoided. Thus a predictable spelling system, approximating phonemic orthography, is used, as follows:

* &quot;ae&quot; or &quot;oe&quot; is replaced by &quot;e&quot; (e.g. estradiol vs. oestradiol)
* &quot;ph&quot; is replaced by &quot;f&quot; (e.g. amfetamine vs. amphetamine)
* &quot;th&quot; is replaced by &quot;t&quot; (e.g. levmetamfetamine vs. levo-methamphetamine)
* &quot;y&quot; is replaced by &quot;i&quot; (e.g. aciclovir vs. acyclovir)
* &quot;h&quot; and &quot;k&quot; are avoided where possible

==Names for radicals and groups (salts, esters, and so on)==
Many drugs are supplied as salts, with a cation and an anion. The way the INN system handles these is explained by the WHO at its &quot;Guidance on INN&quot; webpage. For example, amfetamine and oxacillin are INNs, whereas various salts of these compounds – e.g., &quot;amfetamine sulfate&quot; and &quot;oxacillin sodium&quot; – are modified INNs (INNM).

==Comparison of naming standards==
Several countries had created their own nonproprietary naming system before the INN was created, and in many cases, the names created under the old systems continue to be used in those countries. As one example, in English the INN name for a common painkiller is &quot;paracetamol&quot;; the table below gives the alternative names for this in different systems: 
Other naming systems not listed above include France&#x27;s Dénomination Commune Française (DCF) and Italy&#x27;s Denominazione Comune Italiana (DCIT).

<text>Somerville is a town on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Somerville recorded a population of 11,767 at the 2021 census.

Somerville forms part of an urban enclave on Western Port comprising Somerville, Hastings, Bittern, Crib Point, and Tyabb. Statistically, it is part of Greater Melbourne.

The size of Somerville is approximately .

Originally an orchard town Somerville has experienced significant population growth over the last twenty-five years.

It is served by Somerville railway station on the Stony Point Line, as well as a bus service to Frankston.

Yaringa Marina, east of the township, offers boat access to Western Port.

==History==

The township was once located on Lower Somerville Road, with several original buildings still present today. Somerville Post Office opened on 21 November 1870 and closed in 1893.

The railway came to Somerville in September 1889, Somerville station was originally located approximately one mile from Lower Somerville Road and the town centre but was relocated to its current site during the 1890s. Somerville Railway Station Post Office opened on 15 August 1890 and was renamed Somerville in 1907.

The Somerville Hotel was built in the early 1900s along with the Mechanics&#x27; Hall which formed part of the Station Street shopping strip. The north side of the station, lining the railway had historical buildings that were burnt down in 1987 in an act of vandalism.

Somerville was known during the early 1900s through to World War II for the fruit that was produced in its orchards. A harvest festival was held once yearly and special trains ran from Flinders Street station to the town during the festival.

During the late 1980s and early to mid 1990s the town experienced a population increase with a number of housing estates created.

The Somerville war memorial was unveiled on 4 November 1923 at the intersection of Frankston Flinders Road and Eramosa Road West. With the increasing population and traffic, the memorial was moved from this busy intersection to Clarinda Street in 1966. From November 2014 to April 2015 the memorial was moved from Clarinda Street to the Fruitgrowers Reserve. The cenotaph was restored with markers surrounding it telling the residents the history of the area. Trees were also planted surrounding the memorial remembering the lost soldiers.

An avenue of honour was originally located on Eramosa Road East where road was lined with plane trees in 1917. Each tree represented a resident who fought in World War 1 in Somerville. These trees were removed by the local Shire and footpaths laid in their place in the 1970s. In early 2013 a new avenue of honour of ornamental pear trees was planted along Station Street.

At the 2016 census, Somerville had a population of 11,336 up from 10,730 in 2011, 10,704 in 2006 and 10,049 in 2001.

==Today==

Somerville is experiencing urban growth with an expanding residential area surrounding its retail and commercial hub. Somerville has a vast shopping district with both Woolworths and Coles supermarkets, Target, Aldi and other speciality shops. The iconic Somerville Hotel is a well-known landmark.

There are many parks and playgrounds scattered throughout the area, including the Jones Road Oval and the Fruitgrowers Reserve.

There are award-winning coffee shops located in Somerville.

The Mechanics&#x27; Hall is a popular venue hosting local bands and small school concerts. On 7 January 2015, a massive storm ravaged Somerville and the neighbouring town of Tyabb, ripping the roof off the hall. The roof was restored the following week.

Peninsula Pottery Industries which operated from 1901 to 1979, made bricks for some of the historical buildings in Somerville including St. Andrews Anglican Church and the Somerville Hotel in 1901, but all historical kilns and the chimneys were removed in 2004. Peninsula Pottery Industries was officially deregistered in 1979. Residential development occurred to the south of the pottery a few years after the closure including Wellington Road and Highfield Way estates. The clay pottery reopened in 2015 after years of closure and is now owned and operated by the Bayport Group located at 9 Pottery Road, Somerville, where they are digging to a depth of 30 metres over the 60 acres.

Inghams also has a large factory north of Somerville that employs a large number of the towns population. Inghams is an Australian-based poultry supplier and producer. The company was founded in 1918 by Walter Ingham. Following his death in 1953, his two sons, Jack and Bob Ingham took over the small breeding operation and developed the site into the largest producer of chickens and turkeys in Australia.

<text>René Barjavel (24 January 1911 – 24 November 1985) was a French author, journalist and critic who may have been the first to think of the grandfather paradox in time travel. He was born in Nyons, a town in the Drôme department in southeastern France. He is best known as a science fiction author, whose work often involved the fall of civilisation due to technocratic hubris and the madness of war, but who also favoured themes emphasising the durability of love.

René Barjavel wrote several novels with these themes, such as &quot;Ravage&quot; (translated as &quot;Ashes, ashes&quot;), &quot;Le Grand Secret&quot;, &quot;La Nuit des temps&quot; (translated as &quot;The Ice People&quot;), and &quot;Une rose au paradis&quot;. His writing is poetic, dreamy and sometimes philosophical. Some of his works have their roots in an empirical and poetic questioning of the existence of God (notably &quot;La Faim du tigre&quot;). He was also interested in the environmental heritage which we leave to future generations. Whilst his works are rarely taught in French schools, his books are very popular in France.

Barjavel wrote &quot;Le Voyageur imprudent&quot; (1943), the first novel to present the famous Grandfather paradox of time travel: &quot;if one goes backwards in time and kills one of their ancestors before he had children, the traveller cannot exist and therefore cannot kill the ancestor&quot;.

Barjavel died in 1985 and was buried with his ancestors in Tarendol (commune) cemetery, opposite Mount Ventoux in Provence. He used these place names in his books; Mount Ventoux appears as the site of the space base in &quot;Colomb de la lune&quot;, for example, and Tarendol is the name of the hero in the eponymous novel.

<text>Tootgarook ( ) is a suburb on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Tootgarook recorded a population of 3,178 at the 2021 census. Tootgarook is located within Boonwurrung Country.

==History==

Tootgarook is an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;Croaking of frogs&quot;. Tootgarook is located within Boonwurrung Country.

The town is named from the pastoral run of J. Purves established adjacent to the west of the Tootgarook Swamp (now Wetland). Purves retained the name as his pre-emptive right. 

A Tootgarook Post Office opened in 1858 and was renamed Rye in 1870. A later Tootgarook Post Office opened on 3 April 1956 when some development took place in the suburb, and closed in 1987 

==Today==

In the same suburb, but extending to neighbouring suburbs, is the Tootgarook Wetland. This wetland is about 300 hectares in size and supports many rare and endangered species of flora and fauna. Most of the wetland is in private ownership and some is vulnerable to development.

The local school in the area is Tootgarook Primary School, which currently has 203 students.

<text>SOS Children&#x27;s Villages is an independent, non-governmental, nonprofit international development organization headquartered in Innsbruck, Austria. The organization provides humanitarian and developmental assistance to families facing difficulties and supports children and young people without parental care or at risk of losing it. The organization also protects their interests and rights around the world. Today, SOS Children&#x27;s Villages is active in more than 130 countries and territories worldwide.

SOS Children’s Villages offers alternative care options for children and young people.

Additionally, SOS Children’s Villages advocates together with – and on behalf of – children and young people who have lost parental care or are at risk of losing it.

SOS Children&#x27;s Villages relies on contributions from governments and private donors. In 2017, the organization&#x27;s 350 institutional partnership contracts totaled more than €31 million in institutional funds implemented. Funding from foundations and lotteries totaled nearly €48 million, and corporate partnerships provided more than €49 million in support for SOS Children&#x27;s Villages globally. The organization was awarded the Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize in 2002, and the Princess of Asturias Award of Concord in 2016.

== History ==

The Second World War resulted in many children becoming homeless and orphaned. Hermann Gmeiner (23 June 1919 – 26 April 1986), who himself participated in the war as an Austrian soldier, founded the first SOS Children&#x27;s Village in Imst in the Austrian Federal State of Tyrol in 1949 together with Maria Hofer, Josef Jestl, Ludwig Kögel, Herbert Pfanner, and Hedwig Weingartner. Originally, the SOS Children&#x27;s Village was established to look after the orphans of the Second World War. But later the organization eventually started looking after other children who had experienced abandonment, neglect, and abuse.

In the second half of the 20th century, the organization spread all over Europe. In 1959, SOS Children&#x27;s Villages national associations were established in Italy, France, and Germany, and in the same year, the first SOS Children&#x27;s Villages Youth Facility was founded in Innsbruck, Austria. 
The first caregiver for SOS Children&#x27;s Villages was the Austrian Maria Weber (1919–2011).
This first patron was Béatrice von Boch-Galhau (1914–2011). She financed the first SOS Children&#x27;s Villages programme in Germany (Hilbringen / Saar) with her private assets and she used her political and business connections to promote the idea. As the organization grew, the umbrella organization SOS-Kinderdorf International was established to oversee all the national associations in the world in 1960. In the same year, the first SOS Children&#x27;s Villages organization in South America was founded in Uruguay. In 1963, the organization reached Asia with the first programmes established in South Korea and India. Seven years later, the organization founded programmes in Africa in the Republic of Ivory Coast, Kenya, Ghana, and Sierra Leone. In North America, the first programme was established in 1991 in the United States. Today, there are now more than 570 SOS Children&#x27;s Villages programmes present in 135 countries and territories.

In 2006, the &quot;&quot;Colegio Internacional SOS Hermann Gmeiner&quot;, in Santa Ana, Costa Rica, re-opened as the United World College of Costa Rica, becoming the 11th United World College and the only UWC in Latin America and the Caribbean. Although no longer operating under the auspices of the SOS Children&#x27;s Villages, the college continues to have a relationship with the organization, including a program of full scholarships for SOS Children&#x27;s Villages students, with more than 50 SOS Children&#x27;s Villages students having attended and graduated from the school.

Hermann Gmeiner was the SOS Children&#x27;s Villages president until 1985 when he was succeeded by Helmut Kutin. Helmut Kutin, born in 1941 in Bolzano, Italy, who was one of the first children admitted in SOS Austria, led the organization SOS Children&#x27;s Villages International for 27 years after which in 2012, he was succeeded by Siddhartha Kaul, born in 1951 in Pilani, India.

==Governance==

Each 118 national SOS Children&#x27;s Villages association carries out the international organizations’ missions, protocols, and policies. Regional offices guide this work and provide fundraising, marketing, and technical assistance to country offices as needed. Overall management and administration of the organization takes place at the headquarters in Innsbruck, Austria. The highest decision-making body is the General Assembly responsible for electing the President, Vice-President, and other members of the International Senate. Guiding and monitoring of all SOS’ work is the responsibility of the International Senate made up of 22 members. They establish policies, formulate policy changes, and procedural guidelines. The International Senate&#x27;s work is coordinated by the Management Council, comprising eight representatives from member associations chaired by the President. The Management Council makes recommendations for Senate decisions, approves work plans developed by the Management Team, and defines the federation&#x27;s targets. The General Secretariat comprises the international offices in Austria, and other regional offices responsible for implementing strategic decisions, developing and monitoring the organization&#x27;s quality standards, and representing the organization in international communications and forums.

==International frameworks==

The organization follows three international frameworks that serve as guidelines for their work. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) adopted in 1989 is a human rights treaty that sets out the civil, political, economic, social, health, and cultural rights of children. The UN Guidelines for Alternative Care of Children adopted in 2009 provides a framework for governments to acknowledge and deliver alternative care to children growing up without adequate parental care. And the UN Sustainable Development Goal adopted in 2015 and valid until 2030 in which SOS Children&#x27;s Villages work focuses mainly on children and families living in vulnerable circumstances.

== Campaigns ==
=== 2009 ===
In 2009, the organization launched the &quot;I Matter&quot;&quot; campaign to improve legislation surrounding the practice on leaving care. The aim is to support youth ageing out of care in their transition toward independence.
=== 2012 ===
In 2012, the organization launched the Care For ME! Campaign to encourage research and assessment on alternative child care and to advocate the need to protect the human rights of children from various violations committed against them. Participating countries need to assess whether their national alternative care system complies with the UN Guidelines for Alternative Care of Children.

=== 2017 ===
In 2017, the organization launched the No Child Should Grow Up Alone campaign which aims to emphasize research showing that 1 in 10 children (220 million) worldwide is growing up alone. The campaign is based on global research called the &#x27;Care Effect&#x27; claiming that children growing up without adequate parental care are particularly vulnerable to different forms of human rights violations such as child labor, violence, and sex trafficking.

The report concluded that:&quot;If we provide care for today&#x27;s children in vulnerable circumstances, giving them the foundation they need for learning and developing life skills, we stand a better chance of building a better future for the world”

==Regional and national network==

SOS Children&#x27;s Villages is present in over 130 countries and territories around the world. These are listed below by region. SOS Children&#x27;s Villages organizations in these countries provide active support to children, young people and families. Exceptions are countries marked with an asterisk (), in which SOS Children&#x27;s Villages maintains representative offices which focus on fundraising and building awareness.

=== Africa ===
=== Americas ===
=== Asia ===
=== Europe ===
=== Oceania ===
== Controversy ==
In January 2018, the branch of the association in Ethiopia was accused of supporting Islam, including forcible conversion of children. The organization denies the allegations but does admit that a mosque (now closed) had been built on SOS land, contrary to policy.

== Prominent supporters ==
The first prominent supporter was the German-British businesswoman Béatrice von Boch-Galhau, wife of the largest shareholder of the ceramic manufacturer Villeroy &amp; Boch.
She became friends with the at-the-time unknown Hermann Gmeiner. In 1959, she employed some of her private fortune to pay for the first Kinderdorf in Germany located in Merzig Hilbringen. She also used her husband&#x27;s political connections to promote the SOS Kinderdorf idea which was first meeting resistance from the local majors.

Prominent supporters include Nelson Mandela; the Dalai Lama; international footballers Kakha Kaladze, Andriy Shevchenko, Vincent Kompany, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Cesc Fàbregas and Javier Zanetti; opera singer Anna Netrebko; writer Henning Mankell; Belgian tennis player Kim Clijsters; French writer and actress Anny Dupérey; Sarah, Duchess of York; English Child Actress Georgie Henley; former model Princess Salimah Aga Khan; actress and singer Cher; businessman and television host Mike Holmes; Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter and entertainer June Carter Cash; and Johnny Cash whose memorial fund is towards the work of SOS Children&#x27;s Villages worldwide. The organisation received the 2002 Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize.

SOS Children&#x27;s Villages also receive significant funds through Genworth Financial&#x27;s Putts4Charity initiative, which they run on golf&#x27;s European Tour. In November 2012, the initiative reached €1 million in total money raised since 2007.

<text>Tyabb ( ) is a town on the Mornington Peninsula in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Tyabb recorded a population of 3,449 at the 2021 census.

Tyabb is within an urban enclave on Western Port comprising Tyabb, Hastings, Bittern, Crib Point, and Somerville. It is served by the Tyabb railway station on the Stony Point railway line. Statistically it is part of Greater Melbourne.

Mornington Peninsula&#x27;s first Dog only café is located out the back of the Tyabb Packing House.

==History==

&quot;Tyabb&quot; is derived from the Boonwurrung word &quot;jouap&quot;, one of the recorded names for French Island.

The Post Office opened on 9 March 1891 shortly after the arrival of the railway in 1889.

The local area was well known as a fruit growing area in the early twentieth century and was identified by the &quot;TYCOS&quot; brand, which was the name used by the local growers co-operative.

==Today==

Tyabb is a small township with three primary schools and two high-schools, a Country Fire Authority station, bakery, antique store, motel, cafes and unmanned railway station. There are a number of businesses in the town including fruit processing, cabinet makers, arborists, motel, cafes, pharmacy, equine outfitters and engineering workshops.

Tyabb is well known for its many antique shops. The largest, the Tyabb Packing House Antique complex is housed in an historic cool store building dating from the area&#x27;s fruit growing past. The Tyabb Packing House Antique complex reputedly has one of the largest retail antique collections under one roof in the southern hemisphere. There are several other antique shops in the Tyabb township.

Tyabb also has Tyabb Airport, a private airfield which has been operating for more than fifty years and is owned by Peninsula Aero Club. The airfield hosts an internationally recognised Air Show every second year. The airfield provides access to the area for all emergency services and is an important part of the town&#x27;s economy being the largest employer in the district. It is also home to a collection of important and unique antique and warbird aircraft as well as successful flying school.

In the last decade there has been rapid residential development in the town, changing its rural character. Tyabb has its own cricket and football teams known as the Yabbies competing in the Mornington Peninsula Cricket Association and Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League respectively.

Tyabb is one of the few towns in Australia that does not have a pub. Although the town is over 100 years old it has never had a pub, however two liquor vendors are operating in the town.

Tyabb has given its name to the Tyabb Fault, an ancient geological formation extending from Tyabb across the Peninsula to Mornington, and Tyabb Loam, the characteristic soil of the district. The Tyabb Fault produces many small earthquakes throughout the year.

Tyabb was the scene of a brutal murder when an eleven-year-old boy, Luke Batty, was stabbed to death by his father, following cricket practice on 12 February 2014. His father was shot dead by police at the scene.

<text>Francis Dominic Nicholas Michael Rossi, (born 29 May 1949) is an English musician. He is the co-founder, lead singer, lead guitarist and the sole continuous member of the rock band Status Quo.

== Early life ==
Rossi was born on 29 May 1949 in Forest Hill, London. His father&#x27;s side of the family were Italian ice cream merchants and had an ice cream business in South London, and his mother, who was from a Northern Irish Roman Catholic background, came from Liverpool. He grew up in a household with his parents, grandmother, and &quot;lots of aunts and uncles&quot; and was given a Roman Catholic upbringing, having been named after Saint Francis of Assisi. He would spend holidays in Crosby, Merseyside where his maternal grandparents and aunts and uncles lived.

He attended Our Lady and St Philip Neri Roman Catholic Primary School in Sydenham, and then Sedgehill Comprehensive School, from which he was expelled on his last day for having allowed his classmates to deface his school uniform. His desire to become a musician began after seeing The Everly Brothers live on television at a young age, after which he asked his parents to buy him a guitar for Christmas.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
In 1962, while attending Sedgehill Comprehensive School, Rossi became close friends with future Status Quo bassist Alan Lancaster while playing trumpet in the school orchestra. The two, along with other classmates Alan Key (drums) and Jess Jaworski (keyboards), formed a band called the Scorpions, who played their first gig at the Samuel Jones Sports Club in Dulwich. Key was later replaced by Air Cadets drummer and future Quo member John Coghlan, and the band was renamed the Spectres. The Spectres wrote their own material and played live shows; the line-up soon included Redhill-based keyboard player Roy Lynes, whom they had seen performing with a band called the Echoes who were also based in Redhill. 

In 1965, the Spectres played at a Butlins holiday camp in Minehead. There Rossi met his future long-time Status Quo partner Rick Parfitt, who was playing as part of another band, the Highlights. The two became close friends and agreed to continue working together. In 1966, the Spectres signed a five-year deal with Piccadilly Records, releasing three singles that failed to chart. The group again changed their name, this time to Traffic Jam, after embracing psychedelia.

=== Status Quo ===
In 1967, Traffic Jam changed its name to The Status Quo, but eventually dropped the definite article. Shortly afterward Parfitt joined the band, completing the original line-up, and beginning an almost 50-year partnership with Rossi until Parfitt&#x27;s death in 2016. Rossi had written a song called &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot;, which hit the charts in both the UK and the US in 1968, launching their hit-making career. After some years of minor success, the band reached #5 in the album charts in 1972 with &quot;Piledriver&quot;. Released on Vertigo Records, it included &quot;Paper Plane&quot;, a song penned by Rossi and Bob Young, which was released as a single. 

Status Quo continued to enjoy major success in the UK, Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand through the 1970s and 1980s. They were the opening act of 1985&#x27;s Live Aid, and Rossi wrote and co-wrote some of their biggest hits, including &quot;Caroline&quot; and the band&#x27;s only number one single, &quot;Down Down&quot;.

Early Status Quo albums, up to 1971&#x27;s &quot;Dog of Two Head&quot;, credited him as Mike Rossi. Interviewed in 1996, he explained that his own name was deemed &quot;too poncey&quot; by the band&#x27;s original manager, &quot;so I had to change it to Mike, a real man&#x27;s name, apparently&quot;. Within the band, he is known as &quot;Frame&quot; or &quot;The Gomor&quot; (The Grand Old Man of Rock).

Rossi and Parfitt were the only remaining original members in the band until Parfitt&#x27;s death in 2016. In 2013 and 2014, Rossi and Parfitt reunited with original Quo bandmates Lancaster and Coghlan for a series of reunion concerts. Over their career, Status Quo have sold over 128 million albums worldwide.

=== Other projects ===
In 1984, the year before Quo opened Live Aid, Rossi and Parfitt appeared on the Band Aid charity single, &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; Rossi has also pursued solo projects outside Status Quo. In 1985 when the band was on hold, he recorded two singles with his longtime writing partner Bernie Frost. The single releases were &quot;Modern Romance (I Want to Fall in Love Again)&quot; (UK No. 54), and &quot;Jealousy&quot;. In 1996 he issued a solo album, &quot;King of the Doghouse&quot;, which was not a commercial success, although it produced a UK No. 42 single, &quot;Give Myself to Love&quot;. 

Some years earlier, in 1976, he had appeared on the soundtrack album and film &quot;All This and World War II&quot; comprising cover versions of songs by the Beatles. Although the album sleeve credits the performance of &quot;Getting Better&quot; to Status Quo, the track featured Rossi&#x27;s vocals and the London Symphony Orchestra. In 1977, he produced and played guitar on John Du Cann&#x27;s solo album &quot;The World&#x27;s Not Big Enough&quot;. 3 May 2010 saw the release of his second solo album, &quot;One Step at a Time&quot;, including a re-recording of Quo&#x27;s 1973 single &quot;Caroline&quot;.

In 2013, Rossi starred as himself alongside Quo bandmate Parfitt in the adventure comedy film &quot;Bula Quo!&quot;, which followed the duo on an adventure in Fiji, getting involved in local Mafia operations on the island.

In 2019, Rossi released a joint album with UK singer and violinist Hannah Rickard, entitled &quot;We Talk Too Much&quot; on the earMusic label. The same year, he released his autobiography &quot;I Talk Too Much&quot; (published by Little, Brown), as well as announcing a spoken word tour of the UK of the same name.

== Musical equipment ==
Rossi&#x27;s guitar of choice is the Fender Telecaster, and he has used several over the years including his trademark green 1957 model with a maple fretboard, which he purchased in 1968. It was originally sunburst, but was painted green in 1970. Through the years several parts had been replaced with G&amp;L parts, and a third pickup had been installed in a configuration much like a Stratocaster.

He also owns two other green Fender Telecasters that are both brighter in colour and feature rosewood fretboards. One is used for the song &quot;Down Down&quot; and the other for &quot;Whatever You Want&quot;. Like his main guitar they are both in a three-pickup configuration.

In December 2014, Rossi was said to be &quot;heartbroken&quot; when his green 1957 Telecaster, after 46 years of use, became worn beyond use—the wood having become too soft to be able to properly tune the instrument. The guitar was sold at auction in 2019 for £118,813.

For amplification Rossi uses Marshall JCM800 or JCM900 Lead series amplifiers with 4x12 cabinets and a Roland GP8 to boost his signal. The sound from his Marshall rig is blended with Vox AC30 amplifiers that are kept behind his Marshall setup. He also uses software like Amplitube in the studio.

== Style ==

Rossi, along with the rest of Status Quo, has often been described as &quot;uncool&quot;, including by Rossi himself; in March 2013, he called the Status Quo of 1974 &quot;the most uncool band in the world&quot;. On stage, Rossi normally sported a black waistcoat, blue jeans and a pair of white trainers. In a December 2000 review of a Status Quo concert at Wembley Arena, Andrew Gilchrist writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the white trainers &quot;the only &quot;visual&quot; [the band] really have&quot;.

Interviewed by Simon Hattenstone for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2007, Rossi said that he had idolised Little Richard, saying: &quot;I think that&#x27;s where we got the energy. To me it&#x27;s synonymous with doing rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll. If you don&#x27;t commit physically, rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll doesn&#x27;t really work.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Rossi married his second wife Eileen in 1989 and has eight children from his two marriages. Interviewed in 2011, he said that all of his children played music professionally.
Rossi was estranged from his daughter Bernadette for seventeen years after his relationship with rock publicist Elizabeth Gernon broke up. They reunited in 2007, and her band Bernadette and The North supported Status Quo on that year&#x27;s tour.

In 2019 his autobiography, &quot;I Talk Too Much&quot;, was published by the Little, Brown Book Group. Rossi refers to himself as a lapsed Catholic.

Rossi was known for his long ponytail, which he started growing out around 1974. After 35 years, Rossi cut the ponytail off in 2009, when he noticed his hair was progressively thinning as he was approaching his 60th birthday. &quot;It looked fabulous - I felt like a fashion icon! But in the past few years my hair has got so thin that there&#x27;s not enough to work into a decent ponytail. A few weeks ago it dawned on me that I looked ridiculous. So I decided to forget about clinging to my youth and it was time to grow old gracefully. When it came off I was horrified to look at these six inches of wizened grey strands. I realised I must have looked really stupid.&quot; (Rossi, 2009 interview)

=== Addictions ===
After years of excess, Rossi is teetotal and no longer takes drugs. Rossi claimed to have spent £1.7 million on cocaine in the 1980s. This heavy cocaine use resulted in a piece of his nasal septum falling out, leaving a hole inside his nose which he once &quot;pushed a cotton bud through during a TV interview&quot; in order to demonstrate the dangers of drug addiction to young people. In October 2014, Rossi told BBC&#x27;s &quot;HARDtalk&quot; that alcohol was the gateway that led to his cocaine habit. Despite no longer drinking alcohol, in 2010 Rossi became chairman of the 196-year-old Glen Rossie brand of whisky, which the band used to drink whilst on tour.

== Accolades ==
Rossi was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to music and charity, along with Parfitt. Rossi said &quot;It&#x27;s one thing going out to play in front of 50,000 people but talking to the Queen – well that&#x27;s quite another. We were both so humbled by the experience. I mean, this is the Queen after all. She is England, isn&#x27;t she? We have grown up with her as our figurehead since we were tiny children and she&#x27;s still going strong at 83. Not a very rock and roll thing to say I know, but she is simply amazing.&quot;

<text>Abbotsford () is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Yarra local government area. Abbotsford recorded a population of 9,088 at the 2021 census.

Abbotsford is bounded by Collingwood, Richmond and Clifton Hill and separated from Kew by the meandering Yarra River. Formerly part of the City of Collingwood, it is now part of the City of Yarra. Victoria Street forms the southern boundary to Abbotsford (with Richmond); Hoddle Street forms the western boundary (with Collingwood); the Eastern Freeway forms the northern boundary (with Clifton Hill) while the Yarra forms the eastern boundary with Kew, in Boroondara.

Some well-known Abbotsford landmarks include the Skipping Girl Sign, Dights Falls, the former Collingwood Town Hall, Victoria Park Football Stadium and Abbotsford Convent.

Abbotsford is designated one of the 82 Major Activity centres listed in the Metropolitan Strategy Melbourne 2030.

Abbotsford takes its name from the estate of John Orr, which in turn is named after a ford in Scotland&#x27;s Tweed River, used by the abbot of Melrose Abbey. Since World War II the area has become quite ethnically diverse.

==History==

The Abbotsford area was once bush along the Yarra River occupied by the Wurundjeri people. In the Woiwurrung language the area is named &quot;Carran-carramulk,&quot; with &#x27;carran&#x27; meaning prickly myrtle.

The area of Abbotsford was first subdivided in 1838 and sold at an auction in Sydney. One of these lots was purchased by John Dight and the lot was later called Dight&#x27;s Paddock. Dight then further subdivided the land into 5 acre (12 hectare) lots and in 1878 Edwin Trenerry, a Cornwall-based property developer, purchased a large portion of Dight&#x27;s Paddock for his nephew Fredrick Trenerry Brown and proceeded to further subdivide it for a residential estate.

In order to provide recreational facilities for potential residents and hence boost the value of the lots being offered for sale Fred Brown and solicitor David Abbott created a sports oval and called it Victoria Park in 1879.

Abbotsford quickly established as an industrial area, home to many Irish, mostly factory workers, and until the construction of Melbourne&#x27;s sewerage and drainage systems was regularly flooded by the Yarra River. Like many inner Melbourne suburbs, its working class origins have given it a reputation for crime.

Since World War II the area has become quite ethnically diverse, with many Greeks, Italians, Vietnamese, Chinese and more recently Arabs and Africans, making it their home.

In the 1960s a section of the northern part of the suburb was demolished to make way for the Eastern Freeway.

Along with Clifton Hill and Collingwood, the suburb was a part of the City of Collingwood, until former State premier Jeff Kennett conducted a wholesale merger of local government areas in 1994.

Property values have skyrocketed in recent years and many young professionals have moved to the area and the old industrial areas have experienced significant gentrification and urban renewal since 2000.

A steady stream of migration since the 1980s has made Abbotsford home to Melbourne&#x27;s largest Vietnamese community. So much so that Victoria Street is also known as Little Saigon. It is best known for its exceptional varieties of Vietnamese food, which draws tourists to the area from across Melbourne.

==Industry==
Abbotsford is home to Carlton &amp; United Breweries, the company which produces Victoria Bitter and Foster&#x27;s Lager. The malt smell of brewing often fills the surrounding area. Visitors can see the beer making process at the Carlton Brewhouse centre and tour the brewery. More recently established microbreweries are also located in Abbotsford.

==Recreation and leisure==
Dights Falls, where the Merri Creek and Yarra River converge, is a short walk from the Collingwood Children&#x27;s Farm. The area was a significant meeting place for peoples of the Kulin nation, where trade, ceremonies and law matters would take place. It remains a significant cultural and recreational site. Pedestrians pass through Collingwood Children&#x27;s Farm on the Yarra River Trail, which follows the Yarra River from the city to Dight&#x27;s Falls, where it meets the Merri Creek Trail. This also forms part of the Capital City Trail.

On the eastern side of the Yarra opposite Abbotsford, Studley Park, an extensive parkland which merges with the larger Yarra Bend Park, contains Dights Falls and features within it a golf course, sports grounds, and small pockets of remnant bushland.

==Local landmarks==


Victoria Park was the home ground of the Collingwood Football Club from its inception in 1892 until 2005. AFL matches are no longer played there, but Collingwood Football Club&#x27;s VFL matches are played each season at Victoria Park, with free public entry.

Collingwood Children&#x27;s Farm was established in 1979 by the local community with the support of the former City of Collingwood and the former Department of Education to give city children &quot;a taste of country life&quot;. It is located next to the grounds of the Abbotsford Convent Arts Precinct and a Steiner School, on a bend in the Yarra River. It is a small-holding, fully functioning working farm with rare breeds of livestock, vegetable gardens and fruit orchards. Community Garden plots are also a part of the Farm. Eggs and seasonal produce are for sale, and visitors are encouraged to interact with farm animals through activities such as cow milking. The Collingwood Children&#x27;s Farm is sited on the Abbotsford Precinct Heritage Farmlands, the oldest continually farmland in the state of Victoria; farming commenced in 1838 (although anecdotal evidence suggests farming commenced as early as 1836) and has continued uninterrupted since then. The former convent itself was also home to the Lincoln Early Childhood Studies Institute and a campus of La Trobe University for a while, but is now the site of a community and arts precinct use after protracted negotiations between developers, the state government and the Yarra City Council.

The Skipping Girl Sign, the first animated sequence neon sign in Australia, is located at 627 Victoria Street.

===Public buildings===
Abbotsford contains some impressive public buildings, most of them centred on the historic Collingwood Town Hall precinct. Among them is the Carringbush Library, a former Church of Christ, built between 1888 and 1889 in the classical style to the design of Jonathan Rankine. It is on the National Trust register. The Sailors and Soldiers Memorial Hall is an unusual looking free classical building constructed in 1927, on Hoddle Street.

===Housing===

Like many of Melbourne&#x27;s inner suburbs, there are few detached houses in Abbotsford. Residential streets are often narrow, and some streets are leafy. A large proportion of houses in Abbotsford are subject to heritage overlay provisions, which protect their heritage value. The older residential sections consist mostly of working class single-storey Victorian terrace houses. Some double-storey terraces are found along the railway line and off the tram line on Victoria Street. Many terrace houses in Abbotsford remain in a state of disrepair although renovations have steadily increased as the suburb has gentrified. Notable examples are terraces in Charles Street, and the identical pair of Dorothy and Winniefred terraces in Lulie Street, which are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. In recent years, many previous industrial and commercial sites have been redeveloped as housing, including sites along the Yarra River and the Denton Mills hat factory.

===Commercial and industrial===
As a prominent early industrial area, Abbotsford has various outstanding examples of industrial architecture. The most prominent is Denton Hat Mills, a large turn of the century industrial complex designed by architect William Pitt in polychrome brick in 1888. It was the home to Brush Fabrics until 2004, then converted to apartments between 2007 and 2009.

One of the suburb&#x27;s most prominent hotels is the Carringbush Hotel. It was built in 1889 and was originally named the Friendly Societies Hotel. Others prominent hotels include the Park Hotel, Yarra Hotel and Yorkshire Stingo Hotel. The Retreat Hotel on Nicholson St was the filming location for the Australian drama series The Sullivans (1976–1983).

===Bridges===

There are five bridges on the eastern boundary.
* A footbridge across the Merri Creek at Dights Falls.
* The Johnston Street, Studley Park Road bridge. The first bridge was erected in 1858 as a laminated timber arch with laminated timber truss spandrels. It was replaced in 1876 by a riveted wrought iron girder bridge. The current bridge was completed in 1956, featuring reinforced concrete curved-T girders.
* A footbridge connecting Gipps Street and Yarra Bend Park, along the site of Hodgson&#x27;s Punt. The punt can be seen in Chevalier&#x27;s painting &#x27;Studley Park at sunrise&#x27; (1861). By 1861 the punt had stopped operating. It was probably put out of business by the Penny Bridge nearby. According to a letter to The Argus the Punt was still operating in 1856, but a coronial inquest reported in The Argus of 1859 said the body had been found &#x27;near where the old Hodgson&#x27;s Punt crossed the river.&#x27;
* The 1892 Walmer Street footbridge, connecting Walmer Street Kew and Burnley Street Richmond.
* The 1884 Victoria Bridge, connecting Victoria Street to Barkers Road Hawthorn (later widened). This bridge replaced a ferry.

Between 1857 and 1899 a privately owned toll bridge, or &#x27;Penny Bridge&#x27;, connected the north end of Church Street to Yarra Bend Park.

==Educational facilities==

Abbotsford has a government primary school (Abbotsford Primary School), the University of Melbourne Early Learning Centre and the Sophia Mundi Steiner School, which caters for students from Prep to Year 12.

==Transport==
Two railway stations are located in Abbotsford, both on the Mernda and Hurstbridge lines. Collingwood railway station serves the middle of the suburb. Victoria Park station serves the northern section and Victoria Park stadium. Nearby North Richmond Station also services the southernmost part of the suburb.

Tram route 109 (Port Melbourne/Box Hill), and Tram route 12 (St Kilda/Victoria Gardens) run down Victoria Street and route 78 terminates at the corner of Church Street and Victoria Street (technically in Richmond).

Abbotsford is served by numerous bus routes, including route 200 (City centre to Bulleen Terminus), 207 (City centre to Doncaster Shopping Centre) and 202 (University of Melbourne to Yarra Bend Park) along Johnston Street; and 246 (Clifton Hill to Elsternwick), 302 (City centre to Box Hill Station), 303 (City centre to Ringwood North), 304 (City centre to Doncaster Shopping Centre) and 305 (City centre to The Pines Shopping Centre).

Abbotsford is punctuated by the main streets of Hoddle, Johnston, Victoria and Nicholson Streets. Much of Abbotsford is serviced by narrow one-way streets and laneways. Hoddle Street divides Abbotsford from Collingwood and the Eastern Freeway feeds into it at its northern end. Hoddle Street is a major busway and includes a dedicated priority bus lane along the length of the Abbotsford section.

<doc id="611781" wikidata="Q4999948" url="?curid=611781" title="Burnley, Victoria">
<text>Burnley is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 4 km east of the Melbourne central business district, located within the City of Yarra local government area. Burnley recorded a population of 794 at the 2021 census. It has historically been part of the larger Richmond area due to its proximity and small size.

Burnley has the Yarra River as its southern and eastern boundaries. The other boundaries are Burnley Park to the north and Park Grove along with the south end of Burnley Street to the west.

==History==

The Kulin people were the first people to live in the Burnley area. According to the notes of Alfred Howitt, the area was known as Koϊ-wirip in Woiwurrung language, which refers to the ti trees. The scarred trees in Burnley Park such as the Corroboree Tree are a sign of Kulin use of the area.

In 1838 the area approximating Burnley&#x27;s present open space lying in a loop of the Yarra River was reserved as the Survey Paddock. It is bisected by Swan Street (1880s), trisected by railway lines diverging at Burnley (to Hawthorn, 1861 and to Glen Iris, 1890), and skirted on its eastern edge by the Yarra Boulevard (1930s) and on its southern edge by the South Eastern, now Monash Freeway (1962).

The area was named after William Burnley, pioneer land purchaser in Richmond, local councillor and parliamentarian.

Burnley was developed in the 1850s as part of the wider Richmond district as Melbourne expanded eastwards to the Dandenong Ranges. Industrial development followed in the 1860s with workers&#x27; housing established within walking distance of the many local factories manufacturing everything from clothing to pipe organs.

The Horticultural Society of Victoria was granted 12 ha. in the Survey Paddock in 1862 for experimental gardens, mainly for acclimatization of exotic fruits, vegetables and flowers. The site was taken over by the State Department of Agriculture in 1891. The balance of the Survey Paddock became Richmond Park, containing the Pic Nic railway station, east of the present Burnley station, as the entry to a landscaped pleasure ground.

Burnley&#x27;s industrial area was in its south-west corner next to the river. Basalt quarries were worked south of Coppin Street. One of them has been opened up to the river by the cutting of a channel to improve stream velocity to clear upstream floodwaters from Kew. The quarry hole became a dock depot for silt-dredging craft, and the channel also resulted in the formation, mid-stream, of Herring Island. The Richmond Abattoirs were near the old quarries, and municipal dignity was improved with Barkly Gardens (1865).

There were two ferries across the river, one being the Twickenham ferry. It was replaced by the MacRobertson Bridge (1935).

On 22 January 1885, St Bartholomew&#x27;s Anglican Church was opened after land had been granted by the Victorian Government in 1870.

In 1887, the first State primary school was opened; the primary school was demolished in the 1970s to become the Golden Square Bicentennial Park. A temporary primary school in Burnley Park closed in 1987. Quite near the site of the temporary school is a remnant dead tree, evidence of the traditional Aboriginal inhabitants. It may have been a marker tree for ritual events or a tree from which bark was taken for a canoe or shelter. Separated from these areas by the railway line is a section of Burnley Park set aside for travelling circuses and outdoor music events called Reunion Park.

Burnley Post Office opened on 21 March 1887.

In the southernmost part of the Survey Paddock, through which the freeway passes, there is a public golf course and sports facilities comprising the Kevin Bartlett Sporting and Recreation Complex. Bartlett was a Richmond footballer.

In 1991 the adjacent horticultural college celebrated its centenary, by when it was famed for the training of career horticulturists and as the metropolitan venue for demonstrations for amateur gardeners. In its grounds is an ornamental garden area of several hectares, among the best of Melbourne&#x27;s passive recreation areas.

Following the construction of the CityLink road on its southern boundary, one its two tunnels was named for the suburb.

==Local landmarks==

With a large number of historic small homes in narrow streets, Burnley has a diverse range of residential architecture as well as many public buildings including churches, hotels, shops and factories including the former factory and workshop of the pipe organ building firm of George Fincham &amp; Sons, Australia&#x27;s most prolific pipe organ builder from the 1862 until the late 20th century. George Fincham established his business in Stawell Street, Burnley, in 1862.

Burnley has three major parks: Ryan&#x27;s Reserve, on Swan Street, is a centre for tennis and netball; Golden Square Bicentennial Park is the former site of the Burnley Primary School, which was merged with Cremorne Primary School and Richmond Primary School; Burnley Park houses Burnley Oval, near Yarra Boulevard and Melbourne Girls College.

Kevin Bartlett Reserve (named after former Australian rules footballer Kevin Bartlett) houses a number of playing fields and a sporting complex.

Burnley Public Golf Course services local residents and other Melburnians.

A light industrial park opened in the early 2000s (decade), housing General Electric Australia and Amrad Pharmaceutical Research. In 2006, the headquarters of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade was built adjacent to the exit of the Burnley Tunnel.

More recently commercial business park Botanicca was constructed on Swan Street in the 2010s to house the head offices of David Jones and Country Road along with Harris Scarfe and Forever New. In early 2024, David Jones relocated its head office to Docklands. The complex also has a 4-star boutique hotel Element by Westin.

<doc id="611784" wikidata="Q5133240" url="?curid=611784" title="Clifton Hill, Victoria">
<text>Clifton Hill is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Yarra local government area. Clifton Hill recorded a population of 6,606 at the 2021 census.

It is located is located immediately adjacent to Fitzroy North with which it shares the same postcode. Along with Carlton North and Fitzroy North, Clifton Hill has wide streets than most of inner Melbourne, legacy of a government subdivision laid out by Clement Hodgkinson in the 1860s.

Described in the 1880s as the &quot;Toorak of Collingwood&quot;, Clifton Hill fell out of favour, along with much of inner Melbourne, by the mid 20th century. Later becoming a centre of Melbourne&#x27;s bohemianism, the suburb has undergone rapid gentrification in recent years with renewed interest in its inner city location and Victorian and Edwardian housing stock.

==History==
===Etymology===
Clifton Hill was originally part of the municipality of East Collingwood. It was proclaimed on 24 April 1855 by Collingwood&#x27;s businessmen to improve the district, initially only including the areas which would later be known as Collingwood and Abbotsford.

Clifton Hill received its current name, distinguishing it from the remainder of Collingwood, from Clifton Farm, one of the first properties in the area. The word &quot;Hill&quot; was added by land developer John Knipe to spruik his new estate, the first subdivision of which, being 64 freehold properties, was auctioned by Knipe, George and Co. on 18 September 1871.

===Pre-European settlement===
The area now known as Clifton Hill was inhabited from an estimated 31,000 to 40,000 years ago and is part of the lands of the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation.

===19th century===
In the mid-1850s, East Collingwood was known as an unsanitary flood-prone polluted flat. It was &#x27;Melbourne&#x27;s multi-problem suburb&#x27;, described as &quot;An ideal case study in the origins of pollution. The residents were soon wading in (their) own muck ... Collingwood became a cesspool for refuse.&quot; The area was &quot;akin to a swamp and the few who ventured forth were looked upon after their return as people who had performed a somewhat perilous journey.&quot;

In the 1850s, the land that would become Clifton Hill was crown land, but unincorporated, serviced by unsurveyed tracks leading to Northcote and bounded by the surveyed roads of Heidelberg Road and Hoddle Street, which provided access to private quarries in the area, which is between Ramsden and Roseneath Streets, Clifton Hill nowadays, as well as the City of Melbourne quarry, located between Yambla Street and the Merri Creek.

Within a few months, the East Collingwood Local Committee sought permission for East Collingwood to annex what is now Clifton Hill. This annexation was controversial. Henry Groom, a City of Melbourne Councillor, declared, not surprisingly, &quot;The freeholders of Clifton Hill have no desire to depreciate the value of their property by suffering it to be annexed to a swamp which to drain itself would drain our resources.&quot;

East Collingwood was successful in its acquisition of Clifton Hill, and also unsuccessfully pursued the annexation of Studley Park. This formed the City of Collingwood, which remained essentially intact until it was amalgamated, along with the City of Fitzroy and the City of Richmond, into the City of Yarra in 1994.

====Establishment====
While much of Richmond, Fitzroy and Collingwood had been laid out by speculators anxious to increase profits, Clifton Hill was a professionally laid out suburb. Clement Hodgkinson, as Victorian Assistant-Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey (1861–74), was responsible for the government subdivisions of Carlton (1860), North Carlton, North Fitzroy and Clifton Hill (1865–9), Hotham Hill (1866), South and North Parkville (1868–9). Under his supervision, suburban planning employed the grid system used by Robert Hoddle, Hodgkinson&#x27;s predecessor.

Consequently, Smith, Wellington and Hoddle Streets were extended north to connect with Heidelberg Road (now Queens Parade), and planning of Clifton Hill proceeded on a more organised basis than that of the remainder of the municipality, including reservation of land for public recreation purposes.

During the following years, disputes arose as competing interests proposed different locations and routes for infrastructure to be constructed through the municipality, such as major roads and bridges. The North, South, &#x27;flat&#x27; and &#x27;slope&#x27; of the municipality disputed issues that were all seen to benefit one faction to the detriment of another.

A large drain, known as the Reilly Street drain (now located under Alexandra Parade), was constructed to drain the Crown land in Clifton Hill, in order to increase profits for the government when selling the land to private developers. However, this scheme failed when the drain overflowed onto the Collingwood Flat in the first winter after it was constructed. The Reilly Street drain became notorious and continued to be a hazard as occasionally someone fell in and was drowned.

Despite continuing urbanisation and population growth, the municipality remained mostly of rural appearance, with butchers in the south of the municipality holding grazing leases on Crown land in Clifton Hill and on the paddocks on the Collingwood Flat.

====Early development====
As a sentiment of enduring settlement, neighbourhood and civic pride began to develop in the residents of Clifton Hill, demand for public open space such as sporting grounds and public parks and gardens increased. In 1862, a petition from the &#x27;Municipal District of East Collingwood&#x27; was presented to the Legislative Assembly citing the good work of the local Vigilance Committee towards improving Clifton Hill. Often, these reserves also served as common grazing areas when not used for recreational activities. It was at this time that the land that would become the Darling Gardens was reserved.

The land in Clifton Hill began to be sold in 1864 and the area boomed, along with the rest of Melbourne, in the 1880s. Between, it was reported, &#x27;the progress ... was almost a backward one. It truly was &quot;a howling wilderness&quot;.

During the 1880s boom, the population of Collingwood increased by half, from 23,829 (1881) to 35,070 (1891), and the number of dwellings rose from nearly 5,000 to 7,000. As most of the remainder of the municipality had already been developed, this mainly represented the urbanisation of Clifton Hill.

By the end of the 1880s, the area was described as &quot;a residential suburb... which has of late years been extensively built on with a good class of houses and numerous handsome shops. It has an elevated position, and commands an excellent view of the metropolis.&quot; The district was soon &quot;covered with innumerable cottages of the comfortable working classes; street after street; row after row, of these neat brick buildings.&quot;

The Melbourne Tramway &amp; Omnibus Company&#x27;s cable tramway reached Clifton Hill in 1887, providing convenient transport to the commercial district of Smith Street, Collingwood, Bourke Street in the City Centre, as well as spurring development of the local Queens Parade commercial district around the tram terminus.

The elevated location, planned wide streets and calibre of housing resulted in Clifton Hill being described in the 1886 as &quot;The Toorak of Collingwood&quot;.

===20th century===
Clifton Hill&#x27;s residential attraction lessened entering the 20th century as middle class housing grew and industry took up land for factories, mostly in the South of the suburb, adjacent to Alexandra Parade. By the 1960s, the number of intrusive blocks of flats were built, particularly on prominent streets such as South Terrace, overlooking the Darling Gardens.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Clifton Hill was home to an experimental post-punk scene that grew out of the Clifton Hill Community Music Centre, an artist-run space that was located in a 19th-century factory on Page Street.

By the late 20th century, the amenity laid down during development in the 1880s was recognised once more, and Clifton Hill underwent rapid gentrification, with the median property price increasing from 112% to 160% of the Melbourne metropolitan median in the decade to 1996, and 180% by 2017. Furthermore, by this time, the majority of industry had closed or moved elsewhere, freeing industrial sites for residential redevelopment. The former City of Melbourne Quarry at the corner of Ramsden and Yambla Streets, which had become a tip by the 1960s, had been redeveloped into an attractive park, including an adventure playground and skate park, further adding to the amenity of the area.

Clifton Hill was the site of the 1987 Hoddle Street massacre, in which 19-year-old Julian Knight embarked on the 45-minute shooting spree killing seven people and injuring 19 before being arrested by police.

===21st century===
Clifton Hill has been named one of Melbourne&#x27;s most liveable suburbs. Its median property price increased from 112% to 160% of the Melbourne metropolitan median in the decade to 1996 and 180% (AUD1.48 million) by 2017.

==Geography==
===Urban structure===
Housing consists largely of single and double storey Victorian and Edwardian era dwellings comprising a mixture of free standing houses and semi-attached rows of terraces. The suburb is a relatively intact example of late 19th century and early 20th century development and is now almost completely included in heritage planning controls. Dwelling density in Clifton Hill is significantly lower than the remainder of the former City of Collingwood, which also included the suburbs of Collingwood and Abbotsford.

===Demographics===
As of 2021, the resident population of Clifton Hill is 6,606.

===Localities===
====Little Hollywood====
The intersection between Queens Parade and Gold Street was referred to by locals as &quot;Little Hollywood&quot;. However, because of development and badly leased commercial properties most of the film makers in recent years have moved to the neighbouring suburb of Fitzroy. Particularly, the &quot;Hollywood End&quot; of Gertrude Street.

===Landmarks===
===Parks and gardens===
The suburb is well served by parks and gardens, including Darling Gardens and Mayor&#x27;s Park (western precinct) and Quarries Park (eastern precinct).

==Economy==
There are several local shopping strips throughout the suburb, including along Queens Parade on the border with Fitzroy North. It consists of mainly Victorian era shopfronts.

==Transport==
===Road===
Hoddle Street bisects the suburb, dividing it into western and eastern precincts. Other major roads passing through the suburb include Queens Parade, Heidelberg Road and Alexandra Parade. The Eastern Freeway terminates at Alexandra Parade and provides access to Melbourne&#x27;s outer eastern and south-eastern suburbs.

===Public transport===

Clifton Hill railway station forms the junction between the Mernda and Hurstbridge lines, and is located at the corner of Hoddle and Ramsden Streets, opposite Mayors Park and the Darling Gardens. Express and stopping all stations services frequently operate from the station, taking between 9 and 12 minutes to Flinders Street in the city centre.

Tram route 86 runs along Queens Parade, and provides access to Smith Street and Bourke Street in the centre of the city and to Docklands and Bundoora.

Several bus routes run along Hoddle Street and interchange at the railway station.

===Active transport===

Several on and off-road bicycle routes traverse the suburb, including the Capital City Trail and Merri Creek Trail.

<text>Émile Louis (21 January 1934 – 20 October 2013) was a French bus driver and the prime suspect in the disappearance of seven young women in the Yonne department, Burgundy, in the late 1970s. He confessed to their murders in 2000, but retracted this confession one month later. Louis was sentenced to life in prison by the &quot;cour d&#x27;assises&quot; of Yonne in 2004. The sentence, which was upheld on appeal in 2006, was confirmed by the Court of Cassation in 2007.

==Disappearances==
Louis was a prime suspect in the disappearances in the Yonne &quot;Département&quot; of seven young women with mild mental deficiencies between 1975 and 1980. The disappearances initially did not attract much attention, as the girls had no close relatives and lived in homes for the disabled; it was assumed that they had simply run away. A local detective, Christian Jambert, looked into the possible crimes as early as 1981. However, his reports were ignored.

After a long depression following this episode, Jambert committed suicide by gunshot in 1997. Because of two different impacts on Jambert&#x27;s skull, police doubted the suicide thesis at first. After investigations, it appeared that Jambert&#x27;s carbine was modified to shoot in burst mode, and might have caused several skull wounds. The suicide thesis was then confirmed by Justice on several occasions. 

In 1992, Pierre Charrier, the head of the Yonne APAJH association managing the home for disabled young people where the missing girls had been staying, was sentenced to six years in prison for raping a 23-year-old disabled woman.

In 2000, Louis confessed to two of the murders, and gave information as to where the bodies could be found, which police were able to use to recover the bodies from shallow graves. He later retracted his confession, but was convicted of the seven murders in November 2004, and sentenced to life in prison.

==Death==
Louis died on 20 October 2013. In the newspaper it was mentioned that he died in a secure hospital aged 79.

<text>Air Aruba was the main air carrier from the Dutch Caribbean island of Aruba. It was founded in 1986 and declared bankruptcy in 2000. It was headquartered in the Brown Invest Building in Oranjestad, Aruba.

==History==
Air Aruba began in September 1986 as a ground handling agent for most airlines in Aruba. Two years after being founded, on August 18 to be precise, Air Aruba (with the help of KLM and later Air Holland) carried out its first commercial flight with a YS-11 turbo-prop type aircraft operating between the ABC islands of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, as well as Caracas, Venezuela. Over the years, Air Aruba expanded its schedule to various destinations in the Caribbean (Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and St. Maarten), North America (Newark, Miami) and South America (São Paulo, Maracaibo, Las Piedras). Air Aruba also started flying across the Atlantic to Amsterdam and Cologne. This flight was initially operated in conjunction with Air Holland but was later assumed completely by Air Aruba. Subsequently, the fleet was also upgraded, shifting more from turbo-prop aircraft to jet aircraft, including the Boeing 727, 737, 757, and 767. On the ground, Air Aruba also kept developing, forming a new ground handling company as a subsidiary it jointly owned with Ogden Aviation Services. Air Aruba also expanded its reservations office in North America to meet the demand.

Carrying on the tradition of the Aruban people, Air Aruba strove to bring the friendliness of Aruba to the airline industry; however, financial problems made the Government of Aruba seek a new owner for the airline. On October 27, 1998, Air Aruba secured a takeover by the Venezuelan airline Aserca Airlines, which became the majority owner of Air Aruba. In December 1998, Air Aruba leased two brand new MD-90s, expanding the total fleet to 5 aircraft. At the same time, Air Aruba also inaugurated a route to Philadelphia and re-opened a route to Baltimore, making the total number of destinations to 10. In the competitive airline industry, it is important to have stable partnerships with other respected international airlines. Air Aruba had done so by developing fruitful partnerships with, among others, Continental Airlines and KLM. In March 1999, Air Aruba had established a far going agreement with Aserca Airlines and Air ALM to provide a better service in the Caribbean and South America for both its customers and its employees. The rising cost of operations and management caused Air Aruba to file bankruptcy in 2000. Air Aruba suspended its operations as of October 23, 2000.

==Fleet history==

Air Aruba&#x27;s NAMC YS-11s were the first acquired aircraft to be introduced into their fleet. After some time, Air Aruba initially replaced them with an Embraer EMB-120. Later on, they acquired a Boeing 757-200 (to fly to Miami). Furthermore, the fleet size expanded by introducing aircraft from Boeing with the latter aircraft type operating flights to Europe as well as some U.S. routes. In the last operating years of Air Aruba, only the McDonnell Douglas DC-9, MD-80 and MD-90 were operated by Air Aruba until the airline closed its doors.

Air Aruba&#x27;s fleet consisted of the following aircraft:

<doc id="611795" wikidata="Q3454840" url="?curid=611795" title="United Kingdom European Constitution referendum">
<text>A referendum was expected to take place in the United Kingdom in 2006 to decide whether the country should ratify the proposed Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. However, following the rejection of the Constitution by similar referendums in France in May 2005 and the Netherlands in June 2005, the UK vote was postponed indefinitely. The question was thought to have been settled when the constitution was superseded by the Treaty of Lisbon, which Parliament ratified in 2008 without holding a referendum.

==Announcement==
As negotiations finalising the text of the proposed constitution drew to a close in early 2004, Prime Minister, Tony Blair, had consistently denied the need for a referendum on its ratification. However, on 20 April 2004, he announced in the House of Commons that a referendum would in fact be held in due course assuming the treaty was accepted by the European Council.

Initial reaction amongst the opposition was three-fold. Firstly, the Conservatives were pleased as they felt they had forced Tony Blair into a U-turn. For example, Michael Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, said &quot;Who will ever trust you again?&quot; in his response to Blair&#x27;s statement. In response, opponents of Howard have said that he himself has done a U-turn by asking for a referendum at all. Howard was a member of the Conservative Government that rejected calls for a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty in 1993. This treaty conferred many new competences on the Union, something that the proposed constitution did not do; this led some commentators to argue that it was inconsistent to demand a referendum on the constitutional treaty when one was not held on the Maastricht Treaty.

Secondly, the Conservative Party repeated its opposition to such a constitution which it saw as involving an unacceptable loss of sovereignty (See Controversy over the new constitution).

The Conservatives also wanted to know about the timing of the referendum and the precise wording of its question. Commentators expected that a referendum would not be held until after the 2005 general election. They suggested that the Labour Party would seek to minimise the impact of the issue of Europe on the election campaign by saying &quot;we can discuss that at the referendum&quot;.

Supporters of the Government said that a referendum could only be held after sufficient parliamentary time had been devoted to analysing the text, thus forcing a delay until after the election. The Conservatives rejected this, saying that sufficient scrutiny could be given, and a referendum held, in the autumn and winter of 2004.

The Conservatives also suggested that if the Treaty were rejected, the Blair government would repeat the referendum until it got its desired result. In the days after the announcement of the vote, government policy was not immediately clear on this issue: it initially said that the UK would then be in the same position as Ireland was after it rejected the Nice treaty. Ireland subsequently adopted that treaty after a second referendum, suggesting that Britain might attempt to do the same. Denmark also held two referendums before accepting the Maastricht Treaty.

However, at his usual monthly news conference on 22 April, Blair said: &quot;If the British people vote &#x27;no&#x27;, they vote &#x27;no&#x27;. You can&#x27;t keep bringing it back until they vote &#x27;yes&#x27;.&quot; BBC Radio 4 and &quot;The Times&quot; subsequently reported some back-tracking on this issue from &quot;Number 10&quot; (presumably the press office).

==Proposed referendum question==
The proposed referendum question was included in Part 3 of the European Union Bill 2004–2005. The question to appear on ballot papers would have been as follows:

and in Welsh:

permitting a simple YES/NO answer

==Preparations==
Following the agreement of the final constitution draft, Blair announced his full support for it, claiming that it protected the national veto on sensitive issues such as tax, social policy, defence and foreign policy.

On 29 October 2004, the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw ruled out holding a referendum in 2005 as this would have coincided with the UK holding the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union. He said that the referendum would be held in early 2006, providing Labour were re-elected in the 2005 general election.

A bill authorising the referendum was announced in the Queen&#x27;s Speech of 23 November 2004 and was introduced to Parliament in January 2005 as the European Union Bill 2005.

On 26 January 2005 the government announced that the question asked in the referendum would be: &quot;Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?&quot; Theresa May, Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, described the question as &quot;fair&quot;.

===Electoral Commission rules===

The rules governing how British referendums are held were determined by the Electoral Commission. The commission was to judge whether the question asked was clear and unbiased and make recommendations, but Parliament would make the final decision. Caps were also placed on the amount that can be spent by each side of the debate with two &quot;designated organisations&quot;, one for each side of the debate, would be able to spend at most £5m campaigning, of which up to £600,000 could come from public funds, and would also be entitled to free broadcasts and mail shots. All other interested parties would be able to spend at most £500,000 and would have to be registered with the Commission if they receive any single donation in excess of £10,000. Furthermore, the Government was permitted to publish information publicising its view, with no spending limit, until 28 days compared to 70 days for all other participants.
==Opinion polls==
Every opinion poll on how people would vote in a referendum pointed to a &quot;no&quot; vote. 

ICM asked 1,000 voters in the third week of May 2005: &quot;If there were a referendum tomorrow, would you vote for Britain to sign up to the European Constitution or not?”: 57% said no, 24% said yes, and 19% said that they did not know.

==Cancellation==
Following the French and Dutch rejection of the treaty, Jack Straw announced on 6 June 2005, to the House of Commons, that the plans for the referendum in early 2006 had been shelved.

The matter became one of only hypothetical interest following the replacement of the proposed constitution with the agreement of the text of the Treaty of Lisbon on 19 October 2007.

<doc id="611796" wikidata="Q1521313" url="?curid=611796" title="Fortepiano">
<text>A fortepiano is an early piano. In principle, the word &quot;fortepiano&quot; can designate any piano dating from the invention of the instrument by Bartolomeo Cristofori in 1700 up to the early 19th century. Most typically, however, it is used to refer to the mid-18th to early-19th century instruments, for which composers of the Classical era, such as Haydn, Mozart, and the younger Beethoven and Schubert, wrote their piano music.

Starting in Beethoven&#x27;s time, the fortepiano began a period of steady evolution, culminating in the late 19th century with the modern grand. The earlier fortepiano became obsolete and was absent from the musical scene for many decades. In the later 20th century, the fortepiano was revived, following the rise of interest in historically informed performance. Fortepianos are built for that purpose, in specialist workshops.

==Construction==

The fortepiano has leather-covered hammers and thin, harpsichord-like strings. It has a much lighter case construction than the modern piano and, except for later examples of the early nineteenth century (already evolving towards the modern piano), it has no metal frame or bracing. The action and hammers are lighter, giving rise to a much lighter touch, which in well-constructed fortepianos is also very expressive.

The range of the fortepiano was about four octaves at the time of its invention and gradually increased. Mozart wrote his piano music for instruments of about five octaves. The piano works of Beethoven reflect a gradually expanding range; his last piano compositions are for an instrument of about six and a half octaves. The range of most modern pianos, attained in the 19th century, is 7⅓ octaves.

Fortepianos from the start often had devices to change the resonance like the pedals of modern pianos, but they were not always pedals: sometimes hand stops or knee levers were used instead.

==Sound==

Like the modern piano, the fortepiano can vary the sound volume of each note, depending on the player&#x27;s touch. The tone of the fortepiano is quite different from that of the modern piano, however, being softer, with less sustain. Sforzando accents tend to stand out more than on the modern piano, because they differ from softer notes in timbre as well as volume, and decay rapidly.

Fortepianos also tend to have quite different tone quality in their different registers – slightly buzzing in the bass, &quot;tinkling&quot; in the high treble, and more rounded (closest to the modern piano) in the mid range. In comparison, modern pianos are rather more uniform in tone through their range.

==History==

===Cristofori===


The piano was invented by the harpsichord maker Bartolomeo Cristofori in Florence. 
The first reliable record of his invention appears in the inventory of the Medici family (who were Cristofori&#x27;s patrons), dated 1700. 
Cristofori continued to develop the instrument until the 1720s, the time from which the surviving three Cristofori instruments date.

Cristofori is perhaps best admired today for his ingenious piano action, which in some ways was more subtle and effective than that of many later instruments. However, other innovations were also needed to make the piano possible; merely attaching the Cristofori action to a harpsichord would have produced a very weak tone. Cristofori&#x27;s instruments instead used thicker, tenser strings, mounted on a frame considerably more robust than that of contemporary harpsichords. As with virtually all later pianos, in Cristofori&#x27;s instruments the hammers struck more than one string at a time; Cristofori used pairs of strings throughout the range.

Cristofori was also the first to incorporate a form of soft pedal into a piano, the mechanism by which the hammers are made to strike fewer than the maximum number of strings, for which Cristofori used a hand stop. It is not clear whether the modern soft pedal descends directly from Cristofori&#x27;s work or arose independently.

Cristofori&#x27;s invention attracted public attention as the result of a journal article written by Scipione Maffei and published in 1711 in &quot;Giornale de&#x27;letterati d&#x27;Italia&quot; of Venice. The article included a diagram of the action, the core of Cristofori&#x27;s invention. That article was republished in 1719 in a volume of Maffei&#x27;s work, and then in a German translation (1725) in Johann Mattheson&#x27;s &quot;Critica Musica&quot;. The latter publication was perhaps the triggering event in the spread of the fortepiano to German-speaking countries (see below).

Cristofori&#x27;s instrument spread quite slowly at first, probably because, being more elaborate and harder to build than a harpsichord, it was very expensive. For a time, the piano was the instrument of royalty, with Cristofori-built or -styled instruments played in the courts of Portugal and Spain. Several were owned by Queen Maria Barbara of Spain, who was the pupil of the composer Domenico Scarlatti. One of the first private individuals to own a piano was the castrato Farinelli, who inherited one from Maria Barbara on her death.

The first music specifically written for piano dates from this period: the &quot;Sonate da cimbalo di piano&quot; (1732) by Lodovico Giustini. That publication was an isolated phenomenon, and James Parakilas conjectures that the publication was meant as an honor for the composer on the part of his royal patrons. Certainly there could have been no commercial market for fortepiano music while the instrument continued to be an exotic specimen.

It appears that the fortepiano did not achieve full popularity until the 1760s, from which time the first records of public performances on the instrument are dated, and when music described as being for the fortepiano was first widely published.

===Silbermann fortepianos===
It was Gottfried Silbermann who brought the construction of fortepianos to the German-speaking nations. Silbermann, who worked in Freiberg in Germany, began to make pianos based on Cristofori&#x27;s design around 1730. (His previous experience had been in building organs, harpsichords, and clavichords.) Like Cristofori, Silbermann had royal support, in his case from Frederick the Great of Prussia, who bought many of his instruments.

Silbermann&#x27;s instruments were famously criticized by Johann Sebastian Bach around 1736, but later instruments encountered by Bach in his Berlin visit of 1747 apparently met with the composer&#x27;s approval. It has been conjectured that the improvement in Silbermann&#x27;s instruments resulted from his having seen an actual Cristofori piano, rather than merely reading Scipione Maffei&#x27;s article. The piano action Maffei described does not match that found in surviving 18th-century instruments.

Silbermann is credited with the invention of the forerunner of the sustain pedal, which removes the dampers from all the strings at once, permitting them to vibrate freely. Silbermann&#x27;s device was only a hand stop, and so could only be changed during a pause in the music. Throughout the Classical era, even when the more flexible knee levers or pedals had been installed, the lifting of all the dampers was used primarily as a coloristic device.

===Viennese school of builders===
The fortepiano builders who followed Silbermann introduced actions that were simpler than the Cristofori action, even to the point of lacking an escapement, the device that permits the hammer to fall to rest position even when the key has been depressed. Such instruments were the subject of criticism, particularly in a widely quoted 1777 letter from Mozart to his father, but were simple to make and were widely incorporated into square pianos.

====Stein====
One of the most distinguished fortepiano builders in the era following Silbermann was one of his pupils, Johann Andreas Stein, who worked in Augsburg, Germany. Stein&#x27;s fortepianos had (what we, or Cristofori, would call) &quot;backwards&quot; hammers, with the striking end closer to the player than the hinged end. This action came to be called the &quot;Viennese&quot; action, and was widely used in Vienna, even on pianos up to the mid 19th century. The Viennese action was simpler than the Cristofori action, and very sensitive to the player&#x27;s touch. According to Edwin M. Ripin (see references below), the force needed to depress a key on a Viennese fortepiano was only about a fourth of what it is on a modern piano, and the descent of the key only about half as much. Thus playing the Viennese fortepiano involved nothing like the athleticism exercised by modern piano virtuosos, but did require exquisite sensitivity of touch.

Stein put the wood used in his instruments through a very severe weathering process, generating cracks in the wood, into which he would insert wedges. That gave his instruments a considerable longevity, on which Mozart commented, and several instruments survive today.

====Other builders====
Stein&#x27;s fortepiano business was carried on in Vienna with distinction by his daughter Nannette Streicher, along with her husband Johann Andreas Streicher. The two were friends of Beethoven, and one of the composer&#x27;s pianos was a Streicher. Later on, in the early 19th century, more robust instruments, with greater range, were built in Vienna, by (for example) the Streicher firm, which continued through two more generations of Streichers. Composer Johannes Brahms also preferred pianos by Streicher.

Another important Viennese builder was Anton Walter, a friend of Mozart, who built instruments with a somewhat more powerful sound than Stein&#x27;s. Although Mozart very much admired the Stein fortepianos, as the 1777 letter mentioned above makes clear, his own piano was a Walter. Haydn also owned a Walter piano, and even Beethoven expressed a wish to buy one. The fortepianos of Stein and Walter are widely used today as models for the construction of new instruments, discussed below. Still another important builder in that period was Conrad Graf (1782–1851), who made Beethoven&#x27;s last piano. Graf was one of the first Viennese makers to build pianos in quantity, as a large business enterprise. His instruments were played by Chopin, Mendelssohn and Schumann.

Prominent piano makers among the French during the era of the fortepiano included Erard, Pleyel (Chopin’s favorite maker) and Boisselot (Liszt’s favorite).

===English builders===
====Zumpe/Shudi====
The English fortepiano had a humble origin in the work of Johannes Zumpe, a maker who had immigrated from Germany and worked for a while in the workshop of the great harpsichord maker Burkat Shudi. Starting in the middle to late 1760s, Zumpe made inexpensive square pianos that had a very simple action, lacking an escapement, (sometimes known as the &quot;old man&#x27;s head&quot;). Although hardly a technological advancement in the fortepiano, Zumpe&#x27;s instruments proved very popular, being imitated outside England, and playing a major role in the displacement of the harpsichord by the fortepiano. The square pianos were also the medium of the first public performances on the instrument in the 1760s, notably by Johann Christian Bach.

====Backers/Broadwood/Stodart====
Americus Backers, with John Broadwood and Robert Stodart, two of Shudi&#x27;s workmen, produced a more advanced action than Zumpe&#x27;s. That &quot;English grand action&quot;, with an escapement and check, enabled a louder, more robust sound than the Viennese one, though it required deeper touch and was less sensitive. The early English grand pianos by those builders physically resembled Shudi harpsichords, being very imposing, with elegant, restrained veneer work on the exterior. Unlike contemporary Viennese instruments, English grand fortepianos had three strings per note, rather than two.

====Broadwood====


John Broadwood married the master&#x27;s daughter (Barbara Shudi, 1769) and ultimately took over and renamed the Shudi firm. The Broadwood company (which survives to this day) was an important innovator in the evolution of the fortepiano into the piano. Broadwood, in collaboration with Jan Ladislav Dussek, a noted piano virtuoso active in London in the 1790s, developed pianos that gradually increased the range to six octaves. Dussek was one of the first pianists to receive a 5½ foot piano and, in 1793, he wrote the first work for piano &quot;with extra keys&quot;, a piano concert (C 97). The firm shipped a piano to Beethoven in Vienna, which the composer evidently treasured.

==Obsolescence and revival==
From the late 18th century, the fortepiano underwent extensive technological development and evolved into the modern piano (for details, see Piano). The older type of instrument eventually ceased to be made. In the late 19th century, the early music pioneer Arnold Dolmetsch built three fortepianos. However, that attempted revival of the instrument was evidently several decades ahead of its time, and did not lead to its widespread adoption.

In the second half of the 20th century, a great upsurge of interest occurred in period instruments, including a revival of interest in the fortepiano. Old instruments were restored, and many new ones were built along the lines of the old. Fortepiano kits also became available. The ability of builders to recreate the fortepiano drew on the accumulating expertise of the builders who were making harpsichords of historical design; for instance fortepiano pioneer Philip Belt spent two years early in his career working as an apprentice for Frank Hubbard, a prominent builder of historical harpsichords. Other builders also took up fortepiano construction, including Margaret F. Hood, Rodney Regier, Chris Maene, and Paul McNulty.

The reintroduction of the fortepiano has permitted performance of 18th- and early 19th-century music on the instruments for which it was written, yielding new insights into this music (for detailed discussion, see Piano history and musical performance). More and more music schools offer courses of study in the fortepiano. There are several fortepiano competitions, including the MAfestival Brugge and the International Chopin Competition on Chopin era instruments, organized by the Warsaw Chopin Institute.

==Modern fortepiano specialists==
A number of modern harpsichordists and pianists have achieved distinction in fortepiano performance, including Susan Alexander-Max, Paul Badura-Skoda, Malcolm Bilson, Hendrik Bouman, Ronald Brautigam, David Breitman, Wolfgang Brunner, Gary Cooper, Jörg Demus, Ursula Dütschler. Richard Egarr, Richard Fuller, Tuija Hakkila, Christoph Hammer, Robert Hill, Knut Jacques, Jenny Soonjin Kim, Piet Kuijken, Geoffrey Lancaster, Gustav Leonhardt, Trudelies Leonhardt, Morgane Le Corre, Robert Levin, Alexei Lubimov, Steven Lubin, Yury Martynov, Costantino Mastroprimiano, Zvi Meniker, Bart van Oort, Olga Pashchenko, Trevor Pinnock, David Schrader, Viviana Sofronitsky, Andreas Staier, Melvyn Tan, Natalia Valentin, Jos van Immerseel, Andras Schiff, Kristian Bezuidenhout, Katia and Marielle Labèque, Duo Pégase, Vladimir Feltsman.

==Opinions==
People&#x27;s opinions about the sound of the fortepiano vary widely, both from person to person and from instrument to instrument. Here are three representative opinions about fortepianos:

*&quot;Although I am a lover of performances on authentic instruments the fortepiano was one of the least successful instruments and the most deserving of improvement. I am not always comfortable with the sound made by many fortepianos and however fine a performance may be I find it difficult at times to get past the often unpleasant sound.&quot; (Michael Cookson)
*&quot;A frequent initial reaction to the sound of the fortepiano is that it is less beautiful than that of a fine modern concert grand piano. I believe that such a reaction will usually be changed if the player listens to good recordings. The clear sound and relatively short sustain of the fortepiano tends to favor the special elements of style in the music of Haydn and Mozart. The sound is different but not inferior.&quot; (Howland Auchincloss)
*&quot;This reproduction of a 1730 Cristofori – the greatest of all makers and often the most underrated – by Denzil Wraight based on one made for Scarlatti&#x27;s patron Queen Maria Barbara of Spain makes a gorgeous sound. Yes it can be metallic and subdued in climaxes but it has a marvellous delicacy and, especially in the expressive sonatas, a profoundly beautiful sound.&quot; (Gary Higginson)

==Etymology and usage==

&quot;Fortepiano&quot; is Italian for &quot;loud-soft&quot;, just as the formal name for the modern piano, &quot;pianoforte&quot;, is &quot;soft-loud&quot;. Both are abbreviations of Cristofori&#x27;s original name for his invention: &quot;gravicembalo col piano e forte&quot;, &quot;harpsichord with soft and loud&quot;.

The term &quot;fortepiano&quot; is somewhat specialist in its connotations, and does not preclude using the more general term &quot;piano&quot; to designate the same instrument. Thus, usages like &quot;Cristofori invented the piano&quot; or &quot;Mozart&#x27;s piano concertos&quot; are currently common and would probably be considered acceptable by most musicians. &quot;Fortepiano&quot; is used in contexts where it is important to make the precise identity of the instrument clear, as in (for instance) &quot;a fortepiano recital by Malcolm Bilson&quot;.

The use of &quot;fortepiano&quot; to refer specifically to early pianos appears to be recent. Even the authoritative Oxford English Dictionary does not record this usage, noting only that &quot;fortepiano&quot; is &quot;an early name of the pianoforte&quot;. During the age of the fortepiano, &quot;fortepiano&quot; and &quot;pianoforte&quot; were used interchangeably, as the OED&#x27;s attestations show. Jane Austen, who lived in the age of the fortepiano and herself played the instrument, used &quot;pianoforte&quot; (also: &quot;piano-forte&quot;, &quot;piano forte&quot;) for the many occurrences of the instrument in her writings.

<text>Ralph Leonard Kirkpatrick (; June 10, 1911April 13, 1984) was an American harpsichordist and musicologist, widely known for his chronological catalog of Domenico Scarlatti&#x27;s keyboard sonatas as well as for his performances and recordings.

==Life and work==

Kirkpatrick was born in Leominster, Massachusetts in 1911 and began studying piano at a young age. He continued his piano studies in Cambridge while studying art history at Harvard University. He became interested in the harpsichord at Harvard and gave his first harpsichord recital there in 1930. After graduating in 1931, he traveled to Europe on a John Knowles Paine Fellowship. He studied with Nadia Boulanger and harpsichord revival pioneer Wanda Landowska in Paris, with Arnold Dolmetsch in Haslemere, Heinz Tiessen in Berlin, and Günther Ramin in Leipzig. In January 1933 he made his European debut in Berlin performing Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;. In 1933 he also performed several concerts in Italy, including a clavichord recital at the villa of Bernard Berenson. In the summers of 1933 and 1934 he taught at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria. A Guggenheim Fellowship awarded in 1936 enabled him to study seventeenth- and eighteenth-century manuscripts and sources in Europe. In 1938 he inaugurated a festival of Baroque music at the Governor&#x27;s Palace in Williamsburg, Virginia and continued as adviser and principal performer for a number of years.

In 1938, G. Schirmer, NY. published his edition of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;, which includes extensive discussion of ornamentation, fingering, phrasing, tempo, dynamics, and general interpretation. In the late 1930s he began his research on Domenico Scarlatti and he published his acclaimed biography of Scarlatti in 1953. It has been translated into German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Japanese. He also published a critical edition of 60 sonatas by Scarlatti in 1953. Scarlatti&#x27;s sonatas are now conventionally designated by their Kirkpatrick numbers (shown as Kk. --, and more recently with a single K.), which is now considered the standard, authoritative numbering system for these works (despite at least two rival systems) (see opus number and List of solo keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti).

In 1940, he was appointed to the music faculty of Yale University and he remained there until his retirement in 1976, the year that he became blind. He was invited to inaugurate the Ernest Bloch Visiting Professorship at the University of California, Berkeley in 1964 where he gave a series of lectures and performances on Bach&#x27;s &quot;The&quot; &quot;Well-Tempered Clavie&quot;r. These lectures were later published in 1984 as &quot;Interpreting Bach&#x27;s Well-Tempered Clavier: A Performer&#x27;s Discourse of Method.&quot;

He performed widely throughout the United States and Europe from the 1930s to the early 1980s, in recital and with major orchestras. He continued performing even after he became blind in 1976. He resumed performing in 1977 with a semi-private recital at Versailles as well as a public recital at the Frick Collection in New York. He gave one of his last recitals at the first Boston Early Music Festival in 1981.

During the 1960s, Kirkpatrick made recordings of the complete harpsichord works of Johann Sebastian Bach (Archiv). The instruments he used for many of these recordings were ones that had recently been made by the firm of JC Neupert in Bamberg. In the 21st century, such instruments have become known as &quot;revival&quot; style instruments, their features including &#x27;inauthentic&#x27; metal frames and robust, heavy construction. These recordings show Kirkpatrick&#x27;s formidable keyboard technique to full advantage, and, unusually for recordings of the time, he observes almost all of the repeats. His performances of &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; were recorded on both the harpsichord and the clavichord. His later Bach recordings used a reproduction French harpsichord by Hubbard &amp; Dowd.

As a performer and recording artist, he became best known for his harpsichord performances of the keyboard music of Bach and Scarlatti, but he also performed and recorded works by other composers, including Rameau, Couperin, Handel, Byrd, and Purcell. He recorded on the clavichord (e.g. Bach&#x27;s two- and three-part inventions, as well as both volumes of &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;). He recalled playing a clavichord at a house concert in Hamburg, Germany. He performed and recorded on the fortepiano (especially works by Mozart) and also recorded several Mozart piano concertos on the modern piano. He toured widely with the violinist Alexander Schneider and they recorded violin and harpsichord sonatas by Bach and Mozart.

Kirkpatrick also played modern music, including Quincy Porter&#x27;s Concerto for Harpsichord and Orchestra, Darius Milhaud&#x27;s Sonata for Violin and Harpsichord, the Double Concerto for Harpsichord, Piano with Two Chamber Orchestras by Elliott Carter, and the &quot;Set of Four for Harpsichord (or Piano)&quot; by Henry Cowell. Both the Carter and Cowell pieces were inspired by Kirkpatrick and dedicated to him. He also performed and recorded the Manuel de Falla Harpsichord Concerto and played the piano in a recording of the Stravinsky Septet.

In addition to his biography of Scarlatti published in 1953 and his book &quot;Interpreting Bach&#x27;s Well-Tempered Clavier: A Performer&#x27;s Discourse of Method&quot; published posthumously by Yale University in 1984, he also wrote a memoir &quot;Early Years&quot; which was published posthumously in 1985 by Peter Lang. Meredith Kirkpatrick edited several books of the writings of Ralph Kirkpatrick entitled &quot;Ralph Kirkpatrick: Letters of the American Harpsichordist and Scholar&quot; (University of Rochester Press, 2014) and &quot;Reflections of an American Harpsichordist: Unpublished Memoirs, Essays, and Lectures of Ralph Kirkpatrick&quot; (University of Rochester Press, 2017).

Kirkpatrick died in Guilford, Connecticut at the age of 72.

Kirkpatrick was an elected member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. On April 2, 1999, the asteroid 9902 Kirkpatrick is named in his honor.

His brother, (1898-1971), was a sociologist. His niece, Meredith Kirkpatrick, wrote a biography of him[1].

<doc id="611800" wikidata="Q1109698" url="?curid=611800" title="Collingwood, Victoria">
<text>Collingwood is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 3km north-east of the Melbourne central business district, located within the City of Yarra local government area. Collingwood recorded a population of 9,179 at the 2021 census.

The area now known as Collingwood is thought to have been named Yálla-birr-ang by the Wurundjeri people, the original Indigenous inhabitants of the area. Following colonisation, the suburb was named in 1842 after Baron Collingwood or an early hotel which bore his name. Collingwood is one of the oldest suburbs in Melbourne and is bordered by Smith Street, Alexandra Parade, Hoddle Street and Victoria Parade.

Collingwood is notable for its historical buildings, with many nineteenth century dwellings, shops and factories still in use. Its major thoroughfare Smith Street, is one of Melbourne&#x27;s major nightlife and retail strips, and has been voted the coolest street in the world. A former industrial suburb, Collingwood is now considered one of Melbourne&#x27;s gay villages and houses a number of creative arts businesses.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The suburb was named after Lord Horatio Nelson&#x27;s &#x27;favourite admiral&#x27; Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood (or, possibly after the &quot;Collingwood Hotel&quot; which existed there and was named after the admiral) by surveyor Robert Hoddle, under instructions from Superintendent Charles La Trobe, in 1842.

===Establishment===
Subdivision and sale of land in Collingwood began in 1838, and was mostly complete by the 1850s. Collingwood was declared a municipality, separate from the City of Melbourne on 24 April 1855, the first to follow the state&#x27;s major population centres of Melbourne and Geelong. Collingwood was proclaimed a town in 1873, and later a city in 1876.

Collingwood&#x27;s early development was directly impacted by the boom in Melbourne&#x27;s population and economy during the Victorian gold rush of the 1850s and 1860s. This resulted in the construction of a large number of small dwellings, as well as schools, shops and churches to support this new population. Around the same time, large industrial developments such as a flour mill and the Fosters brewery were being established.

===19th and 20th centuries===
In the 1870s, Smith Street became the dominant shopping strip, with its tram line established in 1887. Many of Collingwood&#x27;s grand public buildings were erected in the 1880s, including the post office and town hall. Collingwood also had a strong temperance movement, with two &quot;coffee palaces&quot; springing up in the 1870s, including the large and grand Collingwood Coffee Palace (now the facade of Woolworths – minus original classical pediment and mansard).

At the turn of the century Collingwood&#x27;s Smith Street rivalled Chapel Street in Prahran as the dominant home of suburban emporiums and department stores. The first G.J. Coles store was opened in the street in 1912.

Since the 1950s, Collingwood has been home to many groups battling to save the suburb&#x27;s unique character against development and gentrification.

In 1958 residents rallied at Collingwood Town Hall against the Housing Commission of Victoria&#x27;s slum reclamation projects, which would see demolition orders for 122 of the suburb&#x27;s homes.

In the 1970s, 150 residents protested against plans for the F-19 freeway, with some putting themselves in front of earthmovers during the construction. In 1977, two women were killed in their home in northern Collingwood in what became known as the Easey Street murders. No arrest for the crime was made until September 2024.

=== Recent history ===

The Collingwood Action Group formed in 2006 to fight the &quot;Banco&quot; development, a large mixed use project on Smith Street. In 2010, over 2,000 people rallied to save The Tote Hotel, a popular live music venue, which became a potential state election issue. The 2016 Bendigo Street housing dispute occurred in north-east Collingwood, in which the community took control of up to 15 empty state government owned houses, in an attempt to provide housing for Melbourne&#x27;s rising homeless population, in the absence of adequate public housing.

In recent years, the office sector has grown in Collingwood, with a number of developments in its southern former industrial area, with some major companies locating their headquarters in the suburb.

==Geography==

Collingwood&#x27;s topography is mostly flat, but a prominent slope extends from Hoddle Street up to Smith Street, and also along sections of Hoddle Street.

The suburb is notable for its historical buildings, with many nineteenth century dwellings, shops and factories still in use. From its early days large commercial buildings often coexisted with small dwellings, occupied by working-class families and the mixture of industry and community continues to the present time. For example, Oxford and Cambridge Streets are dominated by imposing red-brick factories and warehouses, formerly occupied by Foy &amp; Gibson, but also feature a number of stone, brick and timber dwellings that date back to the earliest days of the suburb.

==Culture==
===Sport===
Collingwood Football Club has a history dating back to 1892 as an incorporated football club. They were once housed at Victoria Park and are now based at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).

In recent years they won the 2023 Grand Final against the Brisbane Lions. They have won 16 VFL/AFL premierships, which is the equal-most in the league along with Carlton and Essendon, and also won the 1896 VFA premiership.

===Community radio===

3CR is an independent community radio station that is located at the Victoria Parade end of Smith Street. The station has been based in the suburb since 1977 and its frequency is 855AM.

PBS 106.7FM relocated from St Kilda to Collingwood and is located at 47 Easey Street. PBS is a community radio station that celebrated its 25th year of broadcasting in 2004.

===Arts===
The Collingwood Arts Precinct, known as Collingwood Yards, is located on the site of the former Collingwood Technical School and opened on 13 March 2021. Circus Oz is also located in the Yards on Perry Street and has a purpose-built Melba Spiegeltent.

===Economy===
Airline Jetstar, media distributor Madman Entertainment, vitamin brand Swisse and luxury cosmetics brand Aesop have their headquarters located in Collingwood. Many architecture firms are based or have offices in Collingwood and neighbouring Fitzroy, including the headquarters of DKO Architecture.

===Commercial areas===

The main commercial area is Smith Street, which borders Fitzroy. In 2021, Smith Street was named the coolest street in the world.

===Gay village===
Collingwood is one of Melbourne&#x27;s gay villages with several gay oriented entertainment venues. These include the Peel Dancebar which, in 2007, was granted the legal right to ban heterosexual patrons from the bar. By November 2019, sex on premises venue Club 80 had operated in Collingwood for over twenty years, but was closed in 2020 after the sale of its building. 

==Education==

Collingwood Technical School was established in July 1912 as a trades and technical training school. The school closed in 1987 and, combined with the Preston Technical School, was the basis for the formation of the Melbourne Polytechnic, which has a Collingwood campus on Otter Street. In 2022, work began on a major upgrade to the Melbourne Polytechnic Collingwood campus.

Collingwood College, a state P-12 school, is located in the suburb. The private tertiary education provider Collarts is located in the suburb with its main campus on Wellington Street, and specialises in design and creative arts degrees.

==Demographics==

In the , there were 9,179 people in Collingwood. 58.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 4.3%, New Zealand 3.6%, Vietnam 3.1%, Ethiopia 1.9% and China 1.8%. 68.3% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Vietnamese 4.0%, Mandarin 2.2%, Somali 1.9%, Oromo 1.8%, and Cantonese 1.7%. The most common response for religion was No Religion at 58%.

===Housing===

Collingwood&#x27;s housing consists of a large number of high-rise housing commission flats and a number of older single and double storey former workers cottages on small subdivisions.

More recently older warehouses and factories have been converted into apartments and there has been modern townhouse infill and medium density unit development.

==Governance==

The City of Collingwood existed from 1855 until 1994. The suburb is now part of the City of Yarra local government area.

==Public and commercial buildings==
Collingwood has many buildings listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and several notable commercial and public buildings. Yorkuprhire Brewery, built in 1880 to the design of James Wood, with its polychrome brick and mansard roof tower, was once Melbourne&#x27;s tallest building. For many years it has been subject to development proposals and the heritage stables were at one stage demolished without a permit. The site has since been converted to an apartment development.

The former Collingwood Post Office was built between 1891 and 1892 in the Victorian Mannerist style, to the design of John Marsden and is similar to Rupertswood, with its tall tower.

Prominent hotels include the Leinster Arms Hotel, established in 1865 and is the only single storey hotel built in Melbourne in that era, the Sir Robert Peel (&quot;The Peel&quot;) Hotel and the Vine Hotel.

The original Collingwood Magistrates&#x27; Court closed on 1 February 1985, but continued local need saw the establishment of the Neighbourhood Justice Centre court in the suburb in 2007.

Despite its name, the Collingwood Children&#x27;s Farm is in the neighbouring suburb of Abbotsford.

==Transport==

The roads within Collingwood are mainly narrow one-way streets. The suburb is bounded by main roads: Smith Street to the west, Victoria Parade to the south, Hoddle Street to the east and Alexandra Parade to the north. Major tram routes are on Victoria Parade (tram route 109 and tram route 12) and Smith Street (route 86), which are on the edge of the suburb. Johnston, Wellington and Langridge Streets are the main arterials going through the suburb.

The suburb is served by the nearby Victoria Park and Collingwood railway stations, located in neighbouring Abbotsford.

Separated north-south cycling lanes began being installed on Wellington Street in 2013 and now run to Victoria Street. In 2018, the northern half of Collingwood and Fitzroy reduced its speed limits to 30 km/h, in a first for Melbourne.

==Popular culture==
Australian author Frank Hardy set the novel &quot;Power Without Glory&quot; in a fictionalised version of the suburb, named Carringbush. The name is used by a number of businesses in the area, such as &quot;Carringbush Business Centre&quot;. At one time a ward in the City of Yarra that includes part of Collingwood was actually named Carringbush.

<doc id="611801" wikidata="Q736114" url="?curid=611801" title="Donald Wilson (writer and producer)">
<text>Donald Boyd Wilson (11 September 1910 – 6 March 2002) was a Scottish television writer and producer who worked for the BBC. His work included co-creating the science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 1963, also later saying that he had named the series, and adapting and producing &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; in 1967.

==Early life and career==

Wilson attended the Glasgow School of Art, following which his first jobs were as a newspaper cartoonist and sketch writer.

His initial career was in the film industry, including working for MGM at Elstree Studios, where he was Assistant Director of such films as &quot;Jericho&quot; (1937) and &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1939). During the Second World War he served with the Cameronians and the 43rd Wessex Division before afterwards returning to the film industry, including helming his only film as director, &quot;Warning to Wantons&quot;. In 1955, he was recruited to BBC Television by the then Head of Drama, Michael Barry. As the Head of the Script Department, Wilson was ultimately responsible for overseeing the commissioning and development of all the original scripts and adaptations transmitted by BBC Television.

==&quot;Doctor Who&quot;==

When the Script Department was rendered redundant by Sydney Newman’s radical shake-up of the BBC Drama Department after his arrival as its head in 1962, the highly respected Wilson was given one of the most senior positions under Newman as Head of Serials. In this position, Wilson was responsible for overseeing the creation and development of a series that Newman himself had originally conceived: an educational science-fiction serial entitled &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. It was Wilson, together with Newman and staff writer C. E. Webber, who co-wrote the first format document for the programme.

In a 1971 interview, Wilson said he was responsible for naming the series, and when this claim was put to Newman he did not dispute it. 

Wilson was responsible for much of the early development work on the show, although he did strongly attempt to dissuade producer Verity Lambert from using writer Terry Nation&#x27;s script featuring a race of aliens named Daleks. Once the script had been made and transmitted to great success, he called Lambert into his office to tell her that she clearly knew the show better than he did and that he would no longer interfere with her decisions.

==Later career==

In 1965, Wilson gave up his position as Head of Serials to concentrate on realising a long-held ambition of bringing &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; to the screen. Acting as both adapter and producer, Wilson created one of the BBC’s most popular and successful drama serials of all time, which was a huge hit on its eventual screening on BBC Two in 1967, and was quickly repeated on BBC One. He later acted as adapter and producer again on such prestigious costume dramas as &quot;The First Churchills&quot; (1969) and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (1977), and also worked for Anglia Television on their series &quot;Orson Welles Great Mysteries&quot; in 1973.

==Death==

After his work on &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; he retired to Gloucestershire, where he died at the age of 91 in March 2002.

<text>Cremorne is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of the Melbourne central business district, located within the City of Yarra local government area. Cremorne recorded a population of 2,158 at the 2021 census.

It is bounded by the Yarra River, Punt Road, Swan and Church Streets, and divided down the middle by the railway to South Yarra. Covering only about a square kilometre, until 1999 Cremorne existed only as a locality in the larger suburb of Richmond. Cremorne&#x27;s built environment comprises a chaotic mix of uses, a result of being &#x27;walled in&#x27; by main roads and railways on all sides. There are industrial icons such as Bryant and May and Rosella factories, and the Nylex Clock, side by side with Victorian cottages, modern townhouses, offices and light industries.

Cremorne takes its name from the Cremorne Gardens, an amusement park which occupied a riverfront location in the western half of Cremorne for a period in the mid 19th century.

==History==

Cremorne was named after the Cremorne Gardens in London, a popular pleasure ground in England, which derived its name from the Old Irish words &quot;Crích Mugdornd&quot; (modern Irish: &quot;Críoch Mhúrn&quot;), meaning &#x27;boundary&#x27; or &#x27;chieftain&#x27; of Mugdornd. Cremorne, the Anglicisation of the Gaelic name &quot;Críoch Mhúrn&quot;, roughly meaning the &#x27;Bounds of Mourne&#x27;, was a barony in County Monaghan from which an Irish peer, The 1st Viscount Cremorne, took his title. Lord Cremorne gave his name to his London residence in what became the Cremorne Gardens. Other sources claim that rather than referring to a Chieftain, it refers to the territorial area of an ancient tribal group in County Monaghan.

Cremorne was established as six allotments of crown land in 1839 only 5 years after the subdivision of Melbourne&#x27;s CBD by John Batman. Originally it was used for farming estates, with large villas reminiscent of English estates. It was subdivided in linear strips running from Swan Street (leading to the CBD&#x27;s then fishmarket) to the Yarra River. and Cremorne Gardens occupied a river-front location in the western half of Cremorne for a brief period in the mid 19th century. They were established in 1853 by James Ellis(b:1874/01/09 - d. circa 1876), who had earlier managed gardens of the same name on the banks of the Thames, at Chelsea, in London. Entrepreneur George Coppin later acquired and expanded the Gardens which became a major Melbourne attraction at the time, with patrons arriving by train or boat to see wild animals, dancers and other entertainment. However the Gardens closed in 1863 and the land was sold for housing and an asylum.

Although Cremorne was a largely residential area in its early history, the banks of the Yarra became home to many so-called noxious industries, such as tanneries and soap makers, as well as the Richmond Power Station, which opened in 1891. In the 20th century Cremorne became increasingly industrial. Large manufacturing complexes were built, including the Bryant and May and Rosella factories. In the mid 20th century light industry flooded into the area, with the construction of hundreds of small to medium-sizes factories which were occupied by the rag trade, mechanics, printers and small engineering businesses.

The residential areas increasingly became slums, and some parts were threatened with clearance. Well-known Melbourne criminal Dennis Allen owned about a dozen homes in Cremorne, which were used for a variety of illicit purposes. One was demolished in 1989 by police searching for evidence in the Walsh Street police shootings. It had earlier been seized by the Australian Taxation Office. Other shadowy businesses in Cremorne Street in the 1970s included a brothel, a door-to-door business selling fraudulent oil paintings, and clothing sweatshops.

Things started to change in the 1990s however. The inner city became a desirable residential location again and large industries found it uneconomic to operate in inner urban areas. The Richmond Power Station, and the Bryant and May and Rosella factories, were all converted to office space. Businesses such as Just Jeans, Country Road, Mattel and John Wiley &amp; Sons established offices in the suburb. The small Victorian terraces and cottages which abound in Cremorne were snapped up in a renovation boom. Cremorne is now a mixture of period and modern housing, offices, art galleries, bars, and a diminishing light industrial sector. Currently Cremorne has been coined as &#x27;Australian Silicon Valley&#x27; due to a concentration of tech industries such as Seek, Disney and Carsales in the precinct.

==Population==

In the 2016 census, there were 2,018 people in Cremorne. 69.3% of people were born in Australia and 81.4% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion, so described 50.0% and Catholic 17.9%.

==Streets of Cremorne==

Swan Street is one of Melbourne&#x27;s most popular shopping strips. Once famous for the Dimmeys department store, full of discounted seconds and distressed stock, which is now being redeveloped as an apartment complex, it also has an eclectic collection of restaurants and clearance shops. The street also features some fine examples of Edwardian and Victorian architecture. A period of renewal since the early 2000s has seen an influx of cafes and restaurants as well as modern residential apartment development along the strip.

Punt Road is the major north–south link in inner Melbourne and is busy 24 hours a day. Church Street is lined with furniture showrooms.

==Transport==

From December 1859 until about 1864, there was a railway station called Cremorne, just north of Balmain Street, on the Melbourne &amp; Suburban Railway Company&#x27;s line to Windsor. The station provided access to the adjacent Cremorne Gardens. The Windsor line has since been extended as far as Sandringham.

The junction of the two busiest groups of railway lines in Melbourne is in Cremorne. The lines form an east–west barrier through the area and also cut it off from Richmond to the north. Cremorne has one railway station within its boundaries, East Richmond. Trains on the Lilydale, Belgrave, Glen Waverley, and Alamein lines pass through East Richmond, heading towards the eastern suburbs, but many of them do not stop there. Richmond station is slightly to the north of Cremorne, and is Melbourne&#x27;s busiest outside the central business district.

Both Swan and Church Streets have regular tram services.

On the southern border of Cremorne is the Monash Freeway, which makes the Yarra River virtually inaccessible. The suburb is connected to South Yarra by three bridges: the Punt Road Bridge, the Cremorne Railway Bridge and the Church Street Bridge. Freeway exits at Church Street and Punt Road are particularly busy. Balmain Street and Cremorne Street are the main thoroughfares in the suburb, which is characterised by several narrow one-way streets.

<text>Fairfield is an inner suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Darebin and Yarra local government areas. Fairfield recorded a population of 6,535 at the 2021 census.

Fairfield is bounded by Grange Road to the east, the Yarra River to the south, Darebin Road to the north and Northcote to the west.

==History==

Fairfield gets its name from &quot;Fairfield Park&quot;, an estate that was subdivided from large tracts of land that was brought by Charles Henry James, a land speculator. The name was alleged to have come from Derbyshire, England.

Fairfield Post Office opened on 21 February 1887. It has since relocated.

In 1962, Fairfield was part of the former City of Heidelberg. In that year, the suburb, along with Alphington, became part of the City of Northcote, which in 1994, became part of the City of Darebin.

==Commerce and culture==

Fairfield is predominantly residential, with a small north-eastern pocket remaining a light industrial area.

A three-storey hotel, the Grandview Hotel, was completed in 1888, with its licence was granted by the Licensing Court on 15 August in that year. It has been known for hosting live music, and in the 1970s the Aboriginal country music band, the Country Outcasts, featuring Harry &amp; Wilga Williams, had a residency there.

The Station Street shopping district currently has 89 businesses operating within it, with 23 cafes/bars/restaurants and 17 food and wine specialists.

Adjacent to the railway station, facing north-east, is the Fairfield Industrial Dog Object, a tall animatronic wooden dog.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 census, the most common ancestries were English 33.3%, Australian 28.0%, Irish 16.0%, Scottish 11.7 and Italian 10.2%. 73.8% of people were born in Australia with other common countries of birth being England 3.2%, Greece 2.6%, Italy 1.8%, and New Zealand 1.4%. Most common languages, other than English spoken at home are Greek 5.5%, Italian 2.8%, Mandarin 1.1%, Spanish 1.1% and Vietnamese 1.0%.

Fairfield has significant Greek and Italian communities, with 10.3% and 8.8% of residents of the City of Darebin (which Fairfield is contained within) being of those ancestries respectively. There are also strong numbers of Chinese, Dutch, German and Indian residents in the suburb.

==Education==
* Fairfield Primary School
* St Anthony&#x27;s Primary School
* Melbourne Polytechnic has a campus on the site of the former Fairfield Infectious Diseases Hospital, specialising in visual arts, music, horticulture, and jewellery manufacture.

<text>Raymond Stanley Noble (17 December 1903 – 3 April 1978) was an English jazz and big band musician, who was a bandleader, composer and arranger, as well as a radio host, television and film comedian and actor; he also performed in the United States. He is best known for his signature tune, &quot;The Very Thought of You&quot; and &quot;Cherokee&quot;.

Noble wrote both lyrics and music for many popular songs during the British dance band era, known as the &quot;Golden Age of British music&quot;, notably for his longtime friend and associate Al Bowlly. His most iconic musical numbers included songs such as &quot;Love Is the Sweetest Thing&quot;, &quot;Cherokee&quot;, &quot;The Touch of Your Lips&quot;, &quot;I Hadn&#x27;t Anyone Till You&quot;, Goodnight, Sweetheart, What More Can I Ask?, and The Very Thought of You. Noble played a radio comedian opposite American ventriloquist Edgar Bergen&#x27;s stage act of Mortimer Snerd and Charlie McCarthy, and American comedy duo Burns and Allen, later transferring these roles from radio to TV and popular films.

==Early life and career==

Noble was born at 1 Montpelier Terrace in the Montpelier area of Brighton, England. A blue plaque on the house commemorates him. He was the nephew of the Anglican church music composer T. Tertius Noble (1867–1953).

Noble studied at the Royal Academy of Music and in 1927 won a competition for the best British dance band orchestrator that was advertised in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. In 1929, he became leader of the New Mayfair Dance Orchestra, an HMV Records studio band that featured members of many of the top hotel orchestras of the day. Noble recorded prolifically during this time and US Victor released several of his HMV recordings, including &quot;Butterflies in the Rain&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;My Hat&#x27;s on the Side of My Head&quot; and &quot;The Very Thought of You&quot;.

The most popular vocalist with Noble&#x27;s studio band was Al Bowlly, who joined in 1930. During this time, Noble co-wrote &quot;Turkish Delight&quot;, &quot;By the Fireside&quot; and &quot;Goodnight, Sweetheart&quot;. The latter song was a number one hit for Guy Lombardo in the American charts. It was also used (with vocals by Al Bowlly) on the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series episode &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;.
==Career in the United States==
Noble moved to New York City in 1934. The Bowlly/Noble recordings with the British New Mayfair Dance Orchestra on HMV had achieved popularity in the United States and Noble had successes there.

Noble took Al Bowlly and his drummer Bill Harty to the US and asked trombonist Glenn Miller to recruit American musicians to complete the band. Miller played the Trombone in the Ray Noble orchestra, which performed Glenn Miller&#x27;s composition &quot;Dese Dem Dose&quot; as part of the medley &quot;Dese Dem Dose/An Hour Ago This Minute/Solitude&quot; during a performance at the Rainbow Room in 1935. The American Ray Noble band had a successful run at the Rainbow Room in New York City with Bowlly as principal vocalist.

Although Noble was not a singer, he did appear twice as an upper-class Englishman on two of his more popular New York records, 1935&#x27;s &quot;Top Hat&quot; and 1937&#x27;s &quot;Slumming on Park Avenue&quot;. Noble was also an arranger who scored many record hits in the 1930s: &quot;Goodnight, Sweetheart&quot; (1931), &quot;Mad About the Boy&quot; (1932), &quot;Paris in the Spring&quot; (1935), &quot;Blue Danube&quot; (1932), &quot;The Very Thought of You&quot; (1934), &quot;Love Is the Sweetest Thing&quot; (1932), &quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Love to Keep Me Warm&quot; (1937), &quot;I&#x27;ve Got You Under My Skin&quot; (1936), &quot;Easy to Love&quot; (1936), and &quot;Isle of Capri&quot; (1934).

Noble and his orchestra appeared in the 1937 film &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot; with Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, George Burns and Gracie Allen. Noble played a somewhat &quot;dense&quot; character who was in love with Gracie Allen. Bowlly returned to England in January 1937, but Noble continued to lead bands in America, moving into an acting career, often portraying a stereotypical upper-class English character.

Noble played the piano, but seldom did so with his orchestra. In a movie short from the 1940s featuring Ray Noble and Buddy Clark (one of his most popular band singers), Noble is asked by the announcer to play one of his most popular hits. He sits down at the piano and plays &quot;Goodnight, Sweetheart&quot;.

Noble provided music for many radio shows such as &quot;The Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot;, &quot;The Charlie McCarthy Show,&quot; &quot;Burns and Allen&quot; and &quot;On Stage with Cathy and Elliott Lewis&quot; and also guest-appeared in some of their films. He worked with Bergen for nearly fifteen years, playing the foil to McCarthy and the slow-witted Mortimer Snerd, and his orchestra appeared with Edgar Bergen in the 1942 film &quot;Here We Go Again&quot;. He also provided the orchestration for the 1942 Lou Gehrig biopic &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot; starring Gary Cooper. Noble&#x27;s last major successes as a bandleader came with Buddy Clark in the late 1940s.

== Retirement ==
The ventriloquist TV show ended in the mid-1950s, and Noble retired to Santa Barbara, California. In the late 1960s, Noble relocated to Jersey in the Channel Islands. In March 1978, he flew to London for treatment of cancer, and later died of the disease at a London hospital.

Specialist dance band radio stations continue to play his records. Noble has also featured regularly on the Manx Radio programme &quot;Sweet &amp; Swing&quot;, presented by Howard Caine.

== Posthumous honours ==
* In 1987 Noble was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame.
* In 1996 Noble was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.
* In 2005 &quot;The Very Thought of You&quot;, recorded by Ray Noble and His Orchestra on Victor in 1934, received the Grammy Hall of Fame Award

== In popular culture ==
* In 1938 the Noble compositions &quot;The Very Thought of You&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re So Desirable&quot; were recorded by Billie Holiday and Teddy Wilson.
* The Noble and Bowlly 1934 recordings of &quot;Midnight, the Stars and You&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s All Forgotten Now&quot; were prominently featured on the soundtrack of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1980 film &quot;The Shining&quot;.
* In 1990 the Noble composition &quot;You&#x27;re So Desirable&quot; was recorded by Robert Palmer.
* In John Le Carré&#x27;s 1989 book, &quot;The Russia House&quot; and the 1990 film version, protagonist &quot;Barley&quot; Blair, played by Sean Connery in the film, is portrayed as having once played in the &quot;great Ray Noble&#x27;s Band&quot;
* Many of television and film playwright Dennis Potter&#x27;s later works feature characters lip-synching to Noble recordings.

<text>Field Marshal Sir John Greer Dill, (25 December 1881 – 4 November 1944) was a senior British Army officer with service in both the First World War and the Second World War. From May 1940 to December 1941 he was the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, the professional head of the British Army, and subsequently served in Washington, D.C., as Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission and then Senior British Representative on the Combined Chiefs of Staff.

==Early life==
Born in Lurgan, County Armagh, then part of Ireland, on 25 December 1881, John Greer Dill&#x27;s father, also named John, (and who died when the younger John was just twelve years old) was the local bank manager and his mother, Jane, (who died just months after her husband) was a Greer from Woodville, Lurgan. With the death of both parents, &quot;John and his sister were then cared for by an uncle, the Reverend Joseph Grundy Burton&quot;.

Always intended for a career in the armed forces, Dill, along with his sister, Nicolina Frances, attended the Methodist College Belfast, from 1887 to 1889. This was followed by his education at Cheltenham College in Gloucestershire, England and the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. According to historian Richard Doherty, Dill&#x27;s conduct at Sandhurst were &quot;exemplary&quot; although there &quot;were no indications of the outstanding intelligence for which he would later be noted and his marks were described as mediocre&quot;.

==Early life and military career==
From Sandhurst Dill was commissioned on 8 May 1901 as a second lieutenant into the 1st Battalion of the Leinster Regiment, one of eight Irish infantry regiments then in existence in the British Army. The newly-commissioned young officer was posted to South Africa with his battalion to see out the final stages of the Second Boer War (also known as the South African War). After the end of the war in June 1902, Dill left Cape Town with other men of his battalion on the SS &quot;Englishman&quot; in late September 1902, arriving at Southampton the following month, from where they were posted to Fermoy.

Dill, by now a lieutenant since 15 August 1903 (later antedated to 27 May), was appointed as his battalion&#x27;s adjutant on 15 August 1906, having previously been assistant adjutant from 1902. Promoted to captain on 12 July 1911, and by now having &quot;demonstrated an aptitude for staff duties&quot;, he was seconded to study at the British Army Staff College from 1 February 1913, and was still there on the outbreak of the First World War eighteen months later.

==First World War==
Shortly after the war began, and after having briefly serving on the staff of Southern Command, Dill, in October, became brigade major of the 25th Brigade, part of the 8th Division, which was sent to the Western Front to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), where Dill would remain for the rest of the war. He was present at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915 and for which he was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order.

During 1916 Dill, promoted in May to major, served on the General Staff of the 55th (West Lancashire) Division and Canadian Corps, before being promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff (GSO1) of the 37th Division in January 1917. He was moved to the General Staff at General Headquarters in October of that year, initially as part of the Training Section but was soon shifted to the Operations Section. By the end of the war he was a temporary brigadier general, having been promoted to that rank in late March 1918, and had been mentioned in despatches eight times. From the spring of 1918 he was Head of Operations at GHQ, an important promotion after the sacking of many of Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig&#x27;s senior staff following the Battle of Cambrai. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1918 New Year Honours. He also received a number of foreign decorations for his service, including the Officer of the Legion of Honour, the French Croix de guerre, Commander of the Order of the Crown of Belgium, Officer of the Order of the Crown of Romania.

==Between the wars==
After the war Dill, promoted to brevet colonel in June 1919, returned to the Staff College and served as an instructor there. In the 1928 New Year Honours he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). In 1929 he was posted to India and in December 1930 was promoted to the permanent rank of major-general before returning to appointments at the Staff College (for in fact the third time but this time as the college&#x27;s commandant).

After three years there he went to the War Office in London as Director of Military Operations and Intelligence, holding that post until 1 September 1936. Alongside his other positions, he was appointed to the largely honorary role of Colonel of the East Lancashire Regiment on 24 December 1932, a position he held until his death.

Following his service on the General Staff, Dill was sent to Palestine, during the Arab revolt, where he was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the British forces in Palestine on 8 September 1936, holding the post until 1937. He was knighted in the 1937 Coronation Honours with his promotion to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB), and he was then appointed General Officer Commanding, Aldershot Command. The same year he was interviewed by Leslie Hore-Belisha, Secretary of State for War, for the post of Chief of the Imperial General Staff, but lost out to Lord Gort who was almost five years his junior.

==Second World War==
At the outbreak of the Second World War Dill hoped to be appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force, but the position again went to Gort. The resulting vacancy as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) was filled by Sir Edmund Ironside, leaving Dill to be eventually posted as commander of I Corps in France on 3 September 1939. He was promoted to general on 1 October 1939 (with seniority backdated to 5 December 1937).

On returning to the UK in April 1940, Dill was appointed Vice Chief of the Imperial General Staff (and a member of the Army Council), under Ironside, by the then Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. On 27 May 1940, after Chamberlain had been replaced by Churchill, Dill replaced Ironside as CIGS.

Faced with the prospect of a German invasion, Dill produced a memorandum on 15 June advocating the use of chemical warfare against an enemy landing. Although acknowledging that first use of chemical weapons would alienate the United States and invite retaliation, he concluded that &quot;at a time when our National existence is at stake ... we should not hesitate to adopt whatever means appear to offer the best chance of success.&quot;

After criticism from the Director of Home Defence and other offices Dill withdrew the memorandum. Nevertheless, the proposal was largely endorsed by Churchill on 30 June and it was ordered that the Royal Air Force begin preparations for deploying mustard gas, although he added that actual employment would need to be ordered by Cabinet.

Dill was promoted field marshal on 18 November 1941, but by this time it was clear how poorly he and Churchill got on. Dill gained a reputation as unimaginative and obstructionist. Keen to get him out of the way, Churchill at the end of 1941 had Dill advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) and posted him to Washington, D.C. as his personal representative where he became Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission, then Senior British Representative on the Combined Chiefs of Staff. Dill showed a great flair as a diplomatic military presence. In 1943 alone he attended the Quebec Conference, the Casablanca Conference, the Tehran Conference and meetings in India, China and Brazil. He also served on the Combined Policy Committee set up by the British and United States governments under the Quebec Agreement to oversee the construction of the atomic bomb. He was awarded the Henry Howland Memorial Prize in 1944, in part to ensure his continued favour with Churchill.

In the United States he was immensely important in making the Chiefs of Staff committee – which included members from both countries – function, often promoting unity of action. He was particularly friendly with General George Marshall and the two exercised a great deal of influence on President Roosevelt who described Dill as &quot;the most important figure in the remarkable accord which has been developed in the combined operations of our two countries&quot;.

==Death==
Dill served in Washington until his death from aplastic anaemia in November 1944. His funeral arrangements reflected the great professional and personal respect and affection that he had earned. A memorial service was held in Washington National Cathedral and the route of the cortege was lined by some thousands of troops, following which he was interred in Arlington National Cemetery, where a simple service was conducted at the graveside. A witness recorded that &quot;I have never seen so many men so visibly shaken by sadness. [General George] Marshall&#x27;s face was truly stricken ...&quot;. He was sorely missed by the American Joint Chiefs of Staff, who sent a warm message of condolence to their British colleagues:

Dill was posthumously awarded the American Army Distinguished Service Medal in 1944 as well as receiving an unprecedented joint resolution of the United States Congress appreciating his services. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia. The equestrian statue on Dill&#x27;s grave is one of only two at the cemetery, the other is Major-General Philip Kearny&#x27;s.

<text>Fitzroy is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-east of the Melbourne central business district, located within the City of Yarra local government area. Fitzroy recorded a population of 10,431 at the 2021 census.

Planned as Melbourne&#x27;s first suburb in 1839, it later became one of the city&#x27;s first areas to gain municipal status, in 1858, then known as Fitz Roy. It occupies Melbourne&#x27;s smallest and most densely populated area outside the CBD, just 100 ha.

Fitzroy is known as a cultural hub, particularly for its live music scene and street art, and is the main home of the Melbourne Fringe Festival. Its commercial heart is Brunswick Street, one of Melbourne&#x27;s major retail, culinary, and nightlife strips. Long associated with the working class, Fitzroy has undergone waves of urban renewal and gentrification since the 1980s and today is home to a wide variety of socio-economic groups, featuring both some of the most expensive rents in Melbourne and one of its largest public housing complexes, Atherton Gardens.

Its built environment is diverse and features some of the finest examples of Victorian era architecture in Melbourne. Much of the suburb is a historic preservation precinct, with many individual buildings and streetscapes covered by Heritage Overlays. The most recent changes to Fitzroy are mandated by the Melbourne 2030 Metropolitan Strategy, in which both Brunswick Street and nearby Smith Street are designated for redevelopment as Activity centres.

The suburb was named after Sir Charles Augustus FitzRoy, the Governor of New South Wales from 1846 to 1855. It is bordered by Alexandra Parade (north), Victoria Parade (south), Smith Street (east) and Nicholson Street.

==History==
===Pre-settlement history===
The area that is now known as Fitzroy and Collingwood was part of the territory of the country of the Woiwurrung people of the Kulin nation. The area that is now known as Fitzroy was the land of the Wurundjeri people. 

Anthropologist Alfred William Howitt recorded &quot;Ngár-go&quot; (meaning &quot;high ground&quot;) as the Woiwurrung word for Fitzroy in working notes rediscovered in 2018, likely sourced from conversations with elder William Barak between 1897 and 1901. However, it is unclear whether this referred to a broader area (possibly a clan boundary) or an individual hill. In another document, Howitt wrote that Ngár-go referred to a net bag worn by men over their shoulders.

The name &quot;Ngár-go&quot; has been revived in a 2021 project called Yalinguth (meaning &quot;yesterday&quot;).

===19th century===
Melbourne&#x27;s first suburb, Fitzroy was effectively created on 13 February 1839, when the area between Melbourne and Alexandra Parade (originally named Newtown) was subdivided into vacant lots and offered for sale. Newtown was later renamed Collingwood, and the area now called Fitzroy (west of Smith Street) was made a ward of the Melbourne City Council. On 9 September 1858, Fitzroy became a municipality in its own right, separate from the City of Melbourne. In accordance with the Municipal Act, on 28 September 1858, a meeting of ratepayers was held in &#x27;Mr Templeton&#x27;s schoolroom, George street&#x27; to prepare for a local council election, with Thomas Embling, MLA for Collingwood, presiding. The council election took place two days later and the first councilors were; Thomas Rae, George Symons, Edward Langton, Henry Groom, Benjamin Bell, Edwin Bennett and Thomas Hargreave. The first council meeting, held after the declaration of election, was at the Exchange Hotel, George Street, and Symons was unanimously elected chair.

Surrounded as it was by a large number of factories and industrial sites in the adjoining suburbs, Fitzroy was ideally suited to working men&#x27;s housing, and from the 1860s to the 1880s, Fitzroy&#x27;s working class population rose dramatically. The area&#x27;s former mansions became boarding houses and slums, and the heightened poverty of the area prompted the establishment of several charitable, religious and philanthropic organisations in the area over the next few decades. A notable local entrepreneur was Macpherson Robertson, whose confectionery factories covered 30 hectares and stand as heritage landmarks today.

The Fitzroy Gasworks was erected on Reilly Street (now Alexandra Parade) in 1861, dominating the suburb, with the Gasometer Hotel located opposite.

===20th century===
The population of Fitzroy in 1901 was 31,610.

Before World War I, Fitzroy was a working-class neighbourhood, with a concentration of political radicals already living there. Post-war immigration into the suburb resulted in the area becoming socially diverse. Many working-class Chinese immigrants settled in Fitzroy due to its proximity to Chinatown. The establishment of the Housing Commission of Victoria in 1938 saw swathes of new residences being constructed in Melbourne&#x27;s outer suburbs. With many of Fitzroy&#x27;s residents moving to the new accommodation, their places were taken by post-war immigrants, mostly from Italy and Greece and the influx of Italian and Irish immigrants saw a marked shift towards Catholicism from Fitzroy&#x27;s traditional Methodist and Presbyterian roots. The Housing Commission would build two public housing estates in Fitzroy in the 1960s; one in Hanover Street and one at the southern end of Brunswick Street.

From the 1960s through to the 1980s, the area became a meeting place for Aboriginal people who had left missions, Aboriginal reserves, and other government institutions and drifted to the city in a bid to trace their families. The Builders Arms Hotel was the only pub which allowed Aboriginal people to drink there. The Aboriginal Health Service opened on Gertrude Street in 1973 and provided a service largely provided by volunteers, operating as a de facto community centre there until 1992. A nearby street behind a factory was a meeting and drinking place, known to the community as Charcoal Lane. Archie Roach tells of his time in Fitzroy hanging out and getting drunk, and of reconnecting with his siblings there, in his autobiography, &quot;Tell Me Why: The Story of My Life and My Music&quot;. His song &quot;Charcoal Lane&quot; mentions Gertrude Street, Brunswick Street, and other locations in Fitzroy and his time wandering the streets there. Vika and Linda Bull started their careers by singing in various venues around Fitzroy in the 1980s, including the Black Cat Cafe and the Purple Pit. The area is highly significant in the history of the Australian Aboriginal rights movement.

The Fitzroy Magistrates&#x27; Court closed on 1 February 1985.

Like other inner-city suburbs of Melbourne, Fitzroy underwent a process of gentrification from the 1980s onwards. The area&#x27;s manufacturing and warehouse sites were converted into apartments, and the corresponding rising rents in Fitzroy saw many of the area&#x27;s residents move to Northcote and Brunswick.

In June 1994, the City of Yarra was created by combining the Cities of Fitzroy, Collingwood and Richmond.

===21st century===

Gentrification continued into the 2000s, with Gertrude Street being transformed into a string of fine dining restaurants, art galleries, bookshops and fashion stores.

In 2009 the Aboriginal Health Service building at 136 Gertrude Street was converted into a social enterprise restaurant called Charcoal Lane, run by Mission Australia, which provided training for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people and became well known for its gastronomy. It closed its doors in August 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the historic building was handed back to the Victorian Aboriginal Health Service (VAHS).

==Geography==
Fitzroy&#x27;s topography is flat. It is laid out in grid plan and is characterised by a fairly tightly spaced rectangular grid of medium-sized streets, with many of its narrow streets and back lanes facilitating only one-way traffic. Its built form is a legacy of its early history when a mixture of land uses was allowed to develop close to each other, producing a great diversity of types and scales of building.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Australian census conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the total population of Fitzroy was recorded as 10,431 people. Only 58 (0.3%) of the population identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. Just over 60% of the population were born in Australia, but 41.4% of residents had both parents born overseas. The most common countries of birth were England 4.5%, Vietnam 3.3%, New Zealand 3.0%, China 2.1% and United States of America 1.5%.

In the 2016 census, Fitzroy had a population of 10,445. The median age (33) was younger than the national average (38), while the median weekly individual income (AU$925 per week) was higher than the national average (AU$662). Only 24.9% of Fitzroy&#x27;s population were married, compared to 48.1% nationwide.

In 2016, 53.3% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were England 3.9%, Vietnam 3.3%, New Zealand 2.9%, China 2.7% and United States of America 1.2%. 61.0% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Vietnamese 4.1%, Mandarin 2.5%, Cantonese 2.1%, Arabic 2.0% and Greek 1.6%.

==Housing==

Fitzroy&#x27;s housing is diverse. It has some of Melbourne&#x27;s earliest surviving houses and one of Melbourne&#x27;s most extensive stands of terraced housing, along with a mix of converted industrial and commercial buildings, walk-up flats, modern apartments and public housing.

Among the earliest homes are Royal Terrace (1853–1858) on Nicholson Street. Overlooking the Carlton Gardens, Royal Terrace was one of the first of its kind in Melbourne. Fitzroy&#x27;s &quot;character housing&quot; (pre-war) is now mostly gentrified and highly sought after real estate.

As early as 1923, the City of Fitzroy was accused of &#x27;creating slums&#x27; by allowing inappropriate development such as three houses on a 31-foot by 100-foot block. By 1953, the state Housing Minister Thomas Hayes, said that &quot;Camp Pell&quot; in Royal Park, Parkville, Victoria, which had been a temporary military camp for United States forces during the Second World War, &#x27;might become a permanent emergency housing settlement&#x27; and &#x27;Fitzroy slum dwellers who had refused offers of alternative accommodation by the housing Commission because they would have to pay higher rents would probably&#x27; be moved there. Two years later the headline was &#x27;Outcry Rages Over Fitzroy Slums&#x27;, as the state government accused the Commonwealth of bringing in immigrants that the states had nowhere to house, arguing that the &#x27;Awful, dilapidated buildings in Fitzroy, crowded beyond description with exploited New Australians were a grave danger to the health of the community.&#x27; The Atherton Gardens high-rise public housing estate, on the corner of Brunswick and Gertrude streets, is one of Melbourne&#x27;s largest, built by the Housing Commission of Victoria as part of its controversial &quot;slum clearance&quot; urban renewal program in the 1960s. The commission was established by the &quot;Housing Act 1937&quot; in response to slum housing in Melbourne, and operated under the &quot;Slum Reclamation and Housing Act 1938&quot;.

Due to its desirability as a place to live, Fitzroy faces increasing pressure for residential development. Recent residential projects in Fitzroy have sought to express a sense of Fitzroy&#x27;s urban character in various ways and have been hotly contested in some cases.

==Governance==

Fitzroy&#x27;s traditional representation at all levels of government reflects the area&#x27;s working class and bohemianism, and Left-wing politics dominates. The Australian Labor Party and more recently the Australian Greens both have a very strong political presence.

At a local level, Fitzroy is part of the City of Yarra Local Government Area. The Fitzroy area falls within the wards of Langridge and Nicholls, both of which are currently represented by the Australian Greens.

At a state level, Fitzroy is within the Electoral district of Richmond, traditionally a safe Australian Labor Party seat.

At federal level, it is within the Division of Melbourne, which was taken from Labor by the Australian Greens in 2010.

===Former City of Fitzroy and Fitzroy Town Hall===
The area formerly had its own municipal status from 1858, with the City of Fitzroy meeting at Fitzroy Town Hall on Napier Street. The Town Hall is on the Victorian Heritage Register for its state historical and architectural significance. The building was constructed in stages (1863, 1887 and 1890) to comprise municipal offices, meeting hall, police station, courthouse and clock tower.

Since the amalgamation of the Cities of Fitzroy, Collingwood and Richmond in 1994 to form the City of Yarra, the Town Hall has functioned as secondary offices for the City of Yarra, and other occupants including the Fitzroy Legal Service, currently at Level 4, Moor Street entrance.

==Culture==
===Art===

There are many small commercial art galleries, artist-run spaces and artist studios located within the suburb. Fitzroy has a thriving street art community and is also the home of Gertrude Contemporary Art Spaces and the Centre for Contemporary Photography.

===Live performance===
Fitzroy was the primary home of the little band scene, an experimental post-punk scene which thrived from 1978 to 1981. Initially led by local groups the Primitive Calculators and Whirlywirld, it helped foster the careers of a number of notable musicians, including members of Dead Can Dance and Hunters &amp; Collectors.

Today Fitzroy is a hub for live music in Melbourne, and plays host to several prominent venues.

===Heritage===

The Moran and Cato warehouse designed by R.A. Lawson is considered to be of high architectural merit. The Champion Hotel is notable for its grand and flamboyant Edwardian design.

A number of buildings and sites have been included on the Victorian Heritage Inventory (VHI) or classified by the National Trust (NT). These include:

===Cafés===
The tiny suburb of Fitzroy has many cafés. Only one of the original three cafés is still standing – Marios. Bakers relocated north, and closed in 2007, while The Black Cat has transformed itself into a bar, but still retains its onstreet garden. In fact Silas is the oldest café, located between King William and Moore Streets, on the west side.

With the advance of gentrification, a variety of cafés in different styles have opened up and down Brunswick Street, on Smith Street, parts of Gertrude Street and in some of the back streets, in former milk bars and warehouse sites.

=== Markets ===
There are a number of weekend artisan markets in Fitzroy, including the Fitzroy Market and the Rose Street Artists&#x27; Market. 

==Sport==
Formed in 1883, the Fitzroy Football Club, an Australian rules football club, went on to play in the Victorian Football League (now known as the Australian Football League). From 1884 until 1966, Brunswick Street Oval was its primary home ground, even after the club stopped playing games at the venue, the Brunswick Street Oval still remained the primary training and administrative base of the Fitzroy Football Club in the VFL until 1970.

The club had some early success before relocating its home games several times and finally running into financial difficulties in the 1980s, forcing it to merge its AFL operations with the Brisbane Bears at the end of 1996, to form the Brisbane Lions.

The Brisbane Lions adopted a logo, song, and guernsey based on those of Fitzroy, would take eight Fitzroy players in the 1996 draft, three Fitzroy representatives would serve on the board, and the Lions would keep an office in Melbourne.

The Lions would go onto win three premierships in a row in 2001, 2002, and 2003, and be considered one of the greatest teams of the modern era.
The club keeps strong ties within the Fitzroy community, keeping a social club at the Royal Derby Hotel for Victorian Lions fans, and maintaining links with the Fitzroy VAFA team by sponsoring a men’s and women’s player each season.

The strong support of Fitzroy club legends such as Kevin Murray, Garry Wilson, Mick Conlan, Paul Roos, and many more, have only added to the Brisbane Lions being considered the direct continuation of Fitzroy in the AFL.

Fitzroy&#x27;s non-AFL operations came out of administration after the Brisbane merger in 1998, and the clubs shareholders voted for it to continue with the goal of resuming its playing operations. After sponsoring various local clubs, Fitzroy merged with the University Reds and finally returned the playing field after a 13-year absence, participating in the 2009 Victorian Amateur Football Association season with its home games played out of Brunswick Street Oval. Since that time, Fitzroy have doubled their membership and achieved promotion twice within the VAFA. The club currently plays in the premier B division.

The Fitzroy Stars Football Club are an Indigenous club that joined the Northern Football League in 2008. They currently play their home games at Crispe Park in Reservoir with the club&#x27;s off-field administration still based in Fitzroy.

Fitzroy United Alexander Football Club, now Heidelberg United, was Fitzroy&#x27;s first ever sporting club to play at a national level. Founded by Melbourne&#x27;s inner eastern Greek community, the club was relocated to the Brunswick Street Oval in early 1971 but later departed by late 1978. Whilst the club was based in Fitzroy, the club was initially participating in the Victorian State League where it was crowned state champions in the 1975 season. With the club&#x27;s on and off-field strength, Fitzroy was invited to be an inaugural participant of the National Soccer League, the former highest level of soccer in Australia, where the club became the suburb&#x27;s first national sporting team. Although administration and club training was based at Fitzroy, the club used various venues in Melbourne for its home matches. The suburb&#x27;s first domestic first tier sporting match of any code was played at the Brunswick Street Oval on 2 May 1977, with Fitzroy United defeating Brisbane Lions 4–1 in front of over 4000 attendees. The club participated in the 1977 and 1978 seasons as &#x27;Fitzroy&#x27; finishing third and fifth respectively. In late 1978, the club and its administration was relocated to Olympic Village Stadium in Heidelberg West prior to the 1979, with name being changed to Heidelberg United FC as a result of a better stadium deal and there being a larger Greek community in Heidelberg West than Fitzroy.

Fitzroy City Serbia Soccer Club, a soccer club formed in 1953 by Serbian migrants, is based in Fitzroy. The club is currently playing in the Victorian State League Division 3 South-East and play their home games at Fairfield Park, with the club&#x27;s off-field administration still based in Fitzroy.

The Fitzroy Baseball Club, known as the Fitzroy Lions, is a baseball club founded in 1889 to represent Fitzroy. The club has five senior teams competing in the Baseball Victoria Summer League, as well as junior sides representing the club at every age level.

The Melbourne Chess Club, the oldest chess club in the southern hemisphere (est. 1866).

==Social and community services==

The health needs of Fitzroy residents and other Melburnians is served by St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital.

There are two primary schools in Fitzroy: Fitzroy Primary School (government school) and Sacred Heart Primary School (Catholic school). Fitzroy High School is located in Fitzroy North. At the 2021 ARIA Music Awards, Sacred Heart School&#x27;s Zoë Barry won Music Teacher of the Year.

A long tradition of community activism and civil society with many social and community service organisations having been based in Fitzroy. Organisations currently operating in the suburb include; the Fitzroy Legal Service, Yarra Community Housing Limited, Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Tenants Union of Victoria, a free legal service for residential tenants.

==Transport==
Fitzroy&#x27;s major road arterials are Brunswick Street (north-south) and Johnston Street (east-west). Other main roads include Victoria Parade, Nicholson Street, Smith Street and Alexandra Parade, which circumnavigate the suburb. It is characterised by a fairly tightly spaced rectangular grid of medium-sized streets, with many of its narrow streets and back lanes facilitating only one-way traffic. Traffic and parking congestion is a problem and Fitzroy and local councils have implemented strategies to keep this traffic off residential side streets. It has been the site of several controversial inner city freeway proposals, particularly in the 1950s, however none of which have proceeded.

There are no railway stations located in Fitzroy itself, with the nearest stations being in Fitzroy North, and and Stations. There was a short-lived railway station named Fitzroy but it was just north of the actual Fitzroy suburb and was closed to passengers in 1892 (but remained open for freight until 1981). An underground railway line running between the City Loop and Clifton Hill, with stations located beneath Brunswick Street and Smith Street, has been proposed.

Three tram lines pass through Fitzroy or its boundaries:
* Route 86 (Bundoora – Docklands): travels along Nicholson Street, Gertrude Street and Smith Street.
* Route 96 (Brunswick East – St Kilda): travels along Nicholson Street.
* Route 11 (West Preston – Victoria Harbour Docklands): bisects Fitzroy along Brunswick Street.

The St Vincents Plaza tram interchange, in adjacent East Melbourne, is at the junction of Victoria Parade and Brunswick Street and handles tram routes 30, 86, 109 and 11. It also handled tram route 24 before it was discontinued on 27 July 2014.

Cycling is a very popular form of transport in Fitzroy, as with much of the City of Yarra. A station for the Melbourne Bicycle Share scheme is located near the St Vincents Plaza tram interchange.

The City of Yarra also supports a car sharing service, which has several locations in Fitzroy.

==In popular culture==

The 1977 cult classic novel &quot;Monkey Grip&quot; by Helen Garner took place mostly in Fitzroy and Carlton. Many of the central characters frequent the Fitzroy local swimming pool in the summer, referred to as the &quot;Fitzroy baths&quot;, and the heritage-listed &quot;Aqua Profonda&quot; sign at the deep end of the pool is the title of the novel&#x27;s first chapter, used as a metaphor for the central character&#x27;s deeply troubled romantic relationship with a man. The inclusion of the sign and the pool itself gave it some degree of iconic status–its use in the novel was even mentioned in the statement of significance for the sign&#x27;s heritage listing in 2004.

The 2010 Australian television show &quot;Offspring&quot; was set almost entirely in Fitzroy. The main characters of the show were often seen at the Black Cat, a Brunswick Street bar. Fitzroy has also featured in episodes of a number of Australian TV shows, including &quot;City Homicide&quot; and &quot;Rush&quot; (notably in Season 3, where the team shot at Fitzroy Town Hall to commemorate the death of a former colleague).

The movie series and television series, Jack Irish, is filmed in Fitzroy. Based on the Peter Temple novels, it features many Fitzroy cultural icons.

Australian and American musicians have made mention of Fitzroy in their lyrics, including:
* Archie Roach, in &quot;Charcoal Lane&quot; (1990), which mentions Gertrude Street, Brunswick Street, and other locations in Fitzroy
*Clare Bowditch, in the song &quot;Divorcee by 23&quot;
*Musical comedian The Bedroom Philosopher, in the song &quot;Northcote (So Hungover)&quot;.
*American rapper Tyler, The Creator, in his song &quot;Slater&quot;, which mentions skating to Fitzroy
*Dan Sultan&#x27;s song &quot;Old Fitzroy&quot;, the black and white video for which is shot entirely in Fitzroy, featuring shots of and from Atherton Gardens, as well as shots of a number of Fitzroy pubs
*The Distillers&#x27; song &quot;Young Crazed Peeling&quot;, in which Brody Dalle sings about growing up in Fitzroy
*Birds of Tokyo, in their song &quot;Good Lord&quot; reference drinking in Fitzroy pubs.

<text>Fitzroy North is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-east of the Melbourne central business district, located within the Cities of Merri-bek and Yarra local government areas. Fitzroy North recorded a population of 12,781 at the 2021 census.

Also referred to as North Fitzroy in reference to its southern neighbour, Fitzroy North has a distinct character, noted for its prevalence of wide streets, intact Victorian and Edwardian era terraced housing and for the Edinburgh Gardens, a large inner-city park formerly home to the Fitzroy Football Club. Fitzroy North is adjacent to, and shares a postcode and neighbourhood character with Clifton Hill, both being government subdivisions set on elevated ground and to the same layout by Clement Hodgkinson in the 1870s, and distinct from the earlier narrow and more crowded private subdivisions in the lower lying areas of Fitzroy and Collingwood to the south.

==History==
* Edinburgh Gardens is created from a grant of land in March 1862
* Fitzroy North Post Office opened on 2 February 1874.
* Fitzroy North Primary School opened in 1875.
* On 9 August 1987 the Hoddle Street massacre occurred in Fitzroy North and adjacent Clifton Hill.

==Today==
Housing stock includes many fine one and two storey terraces, many dating to the late Victorian period and including characteristic ironwork, verandahs, and stone embellishments. This is one of Melbourne&#x27;s finest and most expensive inner-city locations. John McMahon, twice elected Mayor of Fitzroy built, firstly in 1886, two townhouses at 53/55 Alfred Crescent, and then in 1890 a large and impressive mansion which he called &quot;Avonmore&quot; at 75 Alfred Crescent. Both were designed by Olaf Nicholson, the architect. On one side of the crescent is a large park, overlooked by John&#x27;s and other houses called Edinburgh Gardens, with a famous football oval, bordered by Freeman Street, Brunswick Street, St Georges Road and Alfred Crescent. This park was saved for the people of Fitzroy by John McMahon, when he obtained permanent possession during his first year of Mayorship. An attempt was made by the Government of which Mr Vale was a member, to have a large portion of it excised for public housing. Mr McMahon had Minister Gaunson permanently gazette the land for the people. John also built a terrace of ten shops which he called &quot;Gladstone Terraces&quot; at St. Georges Road. John McMahon was also the chairman and founding president of the Fitzroy Football Club. The Brunswick Street Oval was the home ground of the Fitzroy Football Club until 1967, playing in the Victorian Football League. A linear park, incorporating a section of the Capital City Trail bike path, runs along much of the northern edge of the suburb, on the easement for the Inner Circle railway line, which closed in 1948.

==Description==

Fitzroy North (also called North Fitzroy) is theoretically joined to Fitzroy, but in reality the two are as separate as any suburbs in the inner city. They were always bisected by the width of Alexandra Parade (earlier Reilly Street), but with the building of the Eastern Freeway in the 1970s and its connection to the Parade, the volume of traffic became an overwhelming barrier. Fitzroy North is also distinct in character, with less commercial activity, wider, quieter, leafier streets, and clear delineation to the east provided by the green Merri Creek corridor.

==Residential architecture==

Most of Fitzroy North is single and double storey Victorian and Edwardian housing, comprising rows of terraces, with a mixture of semi-attached and freestanding houses on small to moderately sized blocks. Large parts of the suburb are protected by heritage controls. The suburb is relatively intact and consistent in character, having had far less industrial and commercial development in its formative years than its southern namesake.

Fitzroy North also has some distinctive apartment complexes, mostly built within the last 15 years. Another, on St Georges Road at Park Street, is a redevelopment of the old Fire Station, with an extension at the back reminiscent of three concrete grain silos.

==Commerce==

The main commercial activity in Fitzroy North is on Brunswick Street, St Georges Road and the northern side of Queens Parade, the latter having particularly wide footpaths for a Melbourne commercial strip.

==Transport==

The suburb contains five schools – Fitzroy High School, Merri Creek Primary, Fitzroy Community School, Deutsche Schule Melbourne, an independent co-educational English-German bilingual school and Fitzroy North Primary School. Fitzroy North Primary School has received state media attention for its canteen&#x27;s healthy menu. It also has a LOTE program for Italian language, which is undertaken by all students and hosts large Italian-related events, such as Carnevale.

<text>Sonia Olschanezky (25 December 1923 – 6 July 1944) was a member of the French Resistance and the Special Operations Executive during World War II. Olschanezky was a member of the SOE&#x27;s Juggler circuit in occupied France where she operated as a courier until she was arrested by the Gestapo and was subsequently executed at the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp.

==Early life==

Olschanezky was born in Chemnitz, Germany. Her father, Eli Olschanezky, was born in Odessa and came to Germany to study chemical engineering. He met Olschanezky&#x27;s mother, Helene, at a dance given by the Jewish community in Leipzig. They were engaged on 1 August 1914, the day Germany declared war on Russia. Russian citizens in Germany were then subject to internment. Helene&#x27;s father, a portrait painter from Minsk used his society contacts to arrange for Eli&#x27;s release from internment after six months on condition that he report every week to the police station in Chemnitz. As an enemy alien, he was unable to work as a chemical engineer and took a job as a sales representative for a manufacturer of ladies&#x27; stockings.

In September 1916 Olschanezky&#x27;s parents were married and set up house in Chemnitz where their three children were born. Enoch (25 September 191718 April 1944), Tobias (who later changed his name to Serge; March 1919) and Sonia (25 December 1923). The family lived a comfortable bourgeois life between the wars, with a chauffeur, a cook, and a governess for the children in their apartment on the Hellenenstrasse. As secular Jews, the Olschanezkys celebrated major Jewish holidays and contributed to Jewish charities including the Jewish National Fund.
In 1926 the family left Germany for Bucharest, where Eli Olschanezky had been invited to oversee the construction of, and then run, a factory producing silk stockings. After three years his partners stopped credit and the business failed, which resulted in the family villa and possessions being sold. The family moved to Paris in January 1930 and settled into a &quot;pension de famille&quot; in the Thirteenth Arrondissement. Eli Olschanezky tried to re-establish himself in business but found himself cheated of his money, which left him sick and demoralised, and the family moved to cheaper accommodation. Serge (formerly Tobias), then aged 15, left school and, along with his brother Enoch, got a job in a hotel.

In Paris, Olschanezky became a dance student, and when the manager of a children&#x27;s theatre saw her in class one day she was asked to join the theatre company. Her parents said no at first, but she eventually won them over, and the age of 10 she began performing with Le Théâtre du Petit Monde on Thursday afternoons, the school holiday. Through the influence of a distant relative she appeared on television in a demonstration of the new medium at the 1937 International Exposition in Paris. While still a schoolgirl, she was now working as a performer, appearing at school dances and private affairs, using the professional name of Sonia Olys.

==Occupation and internment==

In May 1940, France was invaded by the German Army. After the French surrender, the new leader, Henri-Philippe Petain, cooperated in the persecution of the Jews in the country.

In May 1942, orders were given for all Jewish men, women and children to wear a six-pointed yellow star on their clothing. The following month, Olschanezky was arrested and sent to the Drancy deportation camp near Paris. Many of the prisoners in Drancy were subsequently sent to extermination camps operated by Nazi Germany.

Her mother contacted friends in Germany who managed to produce false papers that stated that Olschanezky had &quot;economically valuable skills&quot; needed for the war effort. On the production of the papers and the payment of money to a German official, Olschanezky was freed in the autumn of 1942. After her release she told her mother, that she felt she had to &quot;do something to defend us. Others won’t do it for us. We must do it for ourselves.&quot; When her mother asked if she didn&#x27;t think she had already lost enough, she replied that if everyone said that, no one would do anything. Through one of the families for whom she had worked, she met Jacques Weil, who would later become Olschanezky&#x27;s fiancé, and found an opportunity to become a &quot;résistant&quot;.

==Special Operations Executive==
Olschanezky was locally recruited by Jacques Weil to a small Jewish Juggler (also known as Robin) sub-circuit of SOE&#x27;s Physician (also known as Prosper) circuit operating near Paris. The agents of Prosper circuit included Andrée Borrel (courier), Francis Suttill (organizer) and Gilbert Norman (W/T operator). Circuits were also known as networks. Olschanezky was stationed in Châlons-sur-Marne and spent much of her time as a courier between Châlons and their headquarters in the rue Cambon, near the Place de la Concorde, using the codename &quot;Tania&quot; and &quot;Suzanne Ouvrard&quot;. The long-awaited second-front in the form of a cross-channel invasion was expected in the 1943, and sabotage was stepped up through the spring.

One action in which Olschanezky took part succeeded in blowing up a munitions train at Melun, on the Seine south of Paris. To her mother and brothers she never denied the danger she was in. Her brother Serge said of her, &quot;She was not one of those who reveled in it, she just accepted it.&quot; Serge escaped from a POW camp in Germany, with Enoch working for the Robin circuit. Enoch (25 September 1917 – 18 April 1944) was murdered at Auschwitz; no other details are known.

Unknown to London, Olschanezky had refused to follow Weill who fled to Bern (Switzerland) in July 1943 after the arrest of the leader of Robin (Jean Alexandre Worms) following the collapse of Prosper the previous month, leaving her in charge of what was left of Robin and taking immense risks by running messages between different SOE groups that were likely compromised by this collapse.

==Arrest and execution==
===Arrest===

Olschanezky remained free until her capture on 21 January 1944. After being interrogated by the Gestapo, she was imprisoned at Fresnes Prison. On 13 May 1944, Olschanezky together with three other captured SOE agents, Andrée Borrel, Vera Leigh and Diana Rowden, were moved from Fresnes to the Gestapo&#x27;s Paris headquarters at 84 Avenue Foch along with Yolande Beekman, Madeleine Damerment, Eliane Plewman and Odette Sansom, all of whom were F Section agents. (Only Sansom would survive the war.) Later that day they were taken to the railway station, and each handcuffed to a guard on the train. Sansom, in an interview after the war, said:

We were starting on this journey together in fear, but all of us hoping for something above all that we would remain together. We had all had a taste already of what things could be like, none of us did expect for anything very much, we all knew that they could put us to death. I was the only one officially condemned to death. The others were not. But there is always a fugitive ray of hope that some miracle will take place.

The Germans transported Olschanezky and the seven other female agentsBeekman, Borrel, Damerment, Leigh, Plewman, Sansom, and Rowdento a civilian prison for women in Karlsruhe prison where they were placed in separate cells. The agents were treated no differently from other prisoners and were given manual work. Occasionally, they could hear Allied bombers headed for targets within Germany as the war was apparently coming to its end and the prisoners could hope to be liberated in due course. There was some confusion as to what had happened to Olschanezky as she looked similar to another agent Noor Inayat Khan (Cinema circuit) who had also been arrested, and it was thought that Noor might have used Olschanezky&#x27;s name as an alias.

===Execution at Natzweiler-Struthof===

Some time between five and six in the morning on 6 July 1944, not quite two months after their arrival in Karlsruhe, Borrel, Leigh, Olschanezky and Rowden were taken to the reception room, given their personal possessions, and handed over to two Gestapo men who then escorted them 100 kilometres south-west by closed truck to the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp in France, where they arrived around three-thirty in the afternoon. The women&#x27;s arrival was apparently unexpected as was the order by one of the women&#x27;s escorts that the four women were to be executed immediately.

As women were a rarity in the camp their presence immediately attracted attention from both German guards and prisoners. The four women were led through the center of the camp down to the cellblock at the bottom of the camp by SS men and held there until later that night. &quot;One could see from their appearance that they hadn&#x27;t come from a camp,&quot; said a French prisoner. &quot;They seemed young, they were fairly well groomed, their clothes were not rubbish, their hair was brushed, and each had a case in their (&quot;sic&quot;) hand.&quot; 

The four women were initially together but later put into individual cells. Through the windows, which faced those of the infirmary, they managed to communicate with several prisoners, including a Belgian prisoner, Dr Georges Boogaerts, who passed one of the women (whom he later identified as Borrel from a photograph) cigarettes through the window. Borrel threw him a little tobacco pouch containing some money.

Albert Guérisse, a Belgian army physician who had headed the Pat O&#x27;Leary escape line in Marseille, recognized Borrel as one of his former helpers. He exchanged a few words with another one of the women, who said she was English (Leigh or Rowden) before she disappeared into the cellblock building. At the post-war trial of the men charged with the execution of the four women, Guérisse stated that he was in the infirmary and had seen the women, one by one, being escorted by SS guards from the cellblock (Zellenbau) to the crematorium a few yards away. He told the court: &quot;I saw the four women going to the crematorium, one after the other. One went, and two or three minutes later another went.&quot; 

Inside the building housing the crematorium, each woman in turn was told to undress for a medical check and a doctor gave her an injection for what he told one of them was a vaccination against typhus, but was in fact a 10cc dose of phenol which the doctor believed was lethal. When the woman became unconscious after the injection, she was inserted into the crematorium oven. Guérrise said, &quot;The next morning the German prisoner in charge of the crematorium explained to me that each time the door of the oven was opened, the flames came out of the chimney and that meant a body had been put in the oven. I saw the flames four times.&quot; The door was locked from the outside during the executions, but it was possible to see the corridor from a small window above the door, so the prisoner in the highest bunk was able to keep up a running commentary on what he saw. 

The prisoner Guérisse referred to was Franz Berg, who assisted in the crematorium and had stoked the fire that night before being sent back to the room he shared with two other prisoners before the executions. Berg said:

More than one witness talked of a struggle when the fourth woman was shoved into the furnace. According to a Polish prisoner named Walter Schultz, the SS medical orderly (Emil Brüttel) told him the following: &quot;When the last woman was halfway in the oven (she had been put in feet first), she had come to her senses and struggled. As there were sufficient men there, they were able to push her into the oven, but not before she had resisted and scratched [Peter] Straub&#x27;s face.&quot; The next day Schultz noticed that the face of the camp executioner (Straub) had been severely scratched.

The camp doctor (Werner Rohde) was executed after the war. Franz Berg was sentenced to five years in prison but received the death penalty in another trial for a different crime and was hanged on the same day as Rohde. The camp commandant (Fritz Hartjenstein) received a life sentence, while Straub was sentenced to 13 years in prison.

==Awards and honours==

In spite of the efforts of Vera Atkins (F Section&#x27;s intelligence officer during the war), Olschanezky is not commemorated on the Valençay SOE Memorial in the Loire Valley, unveiled in 1991, which is dedicated to the 91 men and 13 women of F Section who were killed in action. Atkins was told by the memorial committee that Olschanezky was not eligible to be noted on the memorial as she was a locally recruited agent, not commissioned in the British armed forces. Nor was this German-born Jew honoured by the British or French governments with any medals or citations, despite her heroic exploits on behalf of these two nations.

A later memorial, the SOE Agents Memorial in Lambeth Palace Road, London, is dedicated to all SOE agents but does not list individual names, so is considered to include people like Olschanezky. Olschanezky is specifically commemorated with a plaque, along with the names of Noor Inayat Khan and Lilian Rolfe, on the Vera Atkins Memorial Seat in the Allied Special Forces Memorial Grove at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. Her name is also on a stone plaque, along with the names of Diana Rowden, Andrée Borrel, and Vera Leigh, in the furnace room of the Natzweiler-Struthof crematorium.

In 1985, SOE agent and painter Brian Stonehouse, who saw Olschanezky and the three other female SOE agents at the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp just before their deaths, painted a poignant watercolour of the four women which now hangs in the Special Forces Club in London.

<doc id="611822" wikidata="Q523880" url="?curid=611822" title="Harper Goff">
<text>Harper Goff (March 16, 1911 – March 3, 1993), born Ralph Harper Goff, was an American artist, musician, and actor. For many years, he was associated with The Walt Disney Company, in the process of which he contributed to various major films, as well as to the planning of the Disney theme parks. During World War II, he was also an advisor to the U.S. Army on camouflage (Blechman 2004; Behrens 2009).

==Early life==
Goff was born in Fort Collins, Colorado. He studied art at Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles, then moved to New York City, where he worked as a magazine illustrator, producing artwork for &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot; and &quot;National Geographic&quot;. As a designer, he sometimes produced advertising for the U.S. Army.

==Camouflage service==
During World War II, by his own account, Goff was approached for advice about camouflage paint by the U.S. Army, because he had been &quot;making paint and working on a do-it-yourself painter&#x27;s kit&quot; (Naversen 1989, p. 150). Assigned to a camouflage research facility at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, he developed a set of paint colors (which he compared to paint-by-number kits) that were used as &quot;standard issue&quot; hues for camouflage, as well as a camouflage pigment that was chemically impermanent, enabling its removal when it was no longer needed. Later in the war, he transferred to the U.S. Navy where (in his words) &quot;I was working on confusing the silhouettes of ships&quot; [not unlike dazzle camouflage] (Naversen 1989, p. 151).

==Film career==
Returning to the U.S., Goff moved back to California and worked as a set designer for Warner Bros., producing the sets for such memorable films as &quot;Sergeant York&quot;, &quot;Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, and &quot;Captain Blood&quot;. Goff was a lifelong model train enthusiast. In 1951, while in a London model-making shop, he met Walt Disney when they both wanted to buy the same model train.

As a result of having met Disney, he joined the Los Angeles artistic team of the Walt Disney Studios, a relationship that continued, off and on, until his death in 1993. His extraordinary work gave a distinctive character to a number of Disney productions. He is specifically credited with many of the finest inventive effects in Disney&#x27;s groundbreaking live-action film, &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;, which he art-directed, even though the movie credit reads: &quot;Production Developed By...&quot; Goff designed the exterior of the &quot;Nautilus&quot;, along with sets for every compartment within the submarine. The film was awarded two Academy Awards, for color art direction and best special effects. At that time, in 1954, the Art Directors Union had created a bylaw within the Academy of Motion Pictures, which stated that only union art directors could win the award. The academy gave the award for &quot;Best Art Direction — Color 1954&quot;, to Goff&#x27;s assistant, John Meehan, because he had a union card. Goff went on to get a union card, but was never given the award.

Years later, Goff created the submarine, &quot;Proteus&quot;, for the film, &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;(Working again with 20.000 Leagues director Richard Fleischer), and art-directed the highly acclaimed &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;.

Goff also contributed heavily to the early renderings and concept art for Disney&#x27;s proposed Mickey Mouse Park, which became the theme park known as Disneyland, and several areas of Walt Disney World theme park.

He also played the banjo in the seven-piece Dixieland band called Firehouse Five Plus Two, formed by other Disney staff and led by trombonist Ward Kimball with animator Frank Thomas on the piano. When Tom Sawyer Island opened in 1973 at Magic Kingdom, they named Harper&#x27;s Mill after him. Just above the Adventureland Bazaar shop in Disneyland, there is a window dedicated to Goff for his time in Walt Disney Imagineering. In 1993, he was posthumously named a Disney Legend.

==Personal life and death==
Goff was married more than 60 years to his wife Flossie Newcomb. He died at his home in Palm Springs, California, on March 3, 1993, at the age on 81 due to heart failure.

<doc id="611833" wikidata="Q2063890" url="?curid=611833" title="Pauline Christianity">
<text>Pauline Christianity or Pauline theology (also Paulism or Paulanity), otherwise referred to as Gentile Christianity, is the theology and form of Christianity which developed from the beliefs and doctrines espoused by the Hellenistic-Jewish Apostle Paul through his writings and those New Testament writings traditionally attributed to him. Paul&#x27;s beliefs had some overlap with Jewish Christianity, but they deviated from this Jewish Christianity in their emphasis on inclusion of the Gentiles into God&#x27;s New Covenant and in his rejection of circumcision as an unnecessary token of upholding the Mosaic Law.

Proto-orthodox Christianity, which is rooted in the first centuries of the history of Christianity, relies heavily on Pauline theology and beliefs and considers them to be amplifications and explanations of the teachings of Jesus. Since the 18th century, a number of scholars have proposed that Paul&#x27;s writings contain teachings that are different from the original teachings of Jesus and those of the earliest Jewish Christians, as documented in the canonical gospels, early Acts, and the rest of the New Testament, such as the Epistle of James, though there has been increasing acceptance of Paul as a fundamentally Jewish figure in line with the original disciples in Jerusalem over past misinterpretations, manifested though movements like &quot;Paul Within Judaism&quot;.

==Definition and etymology==

===Definition===
Pauline Christianity or Pauline theology, also called &quot;Paulism&quot; or &quot;Paulanity&quot;, is the theology and Christianity which developed from the beliefs and doctrines espoused by Paul the Apostle through his writings. Paul&#x27;s beliefs were strongly rooted in the earliest Jewish Christianity, but they deviated from this Jewish Christianity in their emphasis on inclusion of the Gentiles into God&#x27;s New Covenant and in his rejection of circumcision as an unnecessary token of upholding the Law.

===Etymology===
According to Hans Lietzmann, the term &quot;Pauline Christianity&quot; first came into use in the 20th century among scholars who proposed different strands of thought within Early Christianity, wherein Paul was a powerful influence.

Marxist writer Antonio Gramsci (1891–1937), who stressed the similarities between Primitive Christianity and Marxism, used the phrase &#x27;Christo-Paulinism&#x27; not only to indicate Paul&#x27;s greater importance but also to distinguish between theological and ideological beliefs and the organization of the institutional Church.

The expression is also used by modern Christian scholars, such as John Ziesler and Christopher Mount, whose interest is in the recovery of Christian origins, and the importance of Paul for paleo-orthodoxy, Christian reconstructionism and restorationism.

==Paul and the inclusion of Gentiles==

The first Christians were Jews. According to Paul and the author of the Acts of the Apostles, he initially persecuted those early Christians, but then converted, and, years later, was called to proselytise among Gentiles.

===Inclusion of Gentiles===
An early creed about Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection which Paul probably used was 1 Corinthians 15, verses 3–5 (plus possible additional verses). Probably originating from the Jerusalem apostolic community, the antiquity of the creed has been noted by many biblical scholars:
There has been widespread acknowledgement of the view of W. D. Davies that the essential Jewishness of Paul&#x27;s Christian perspective has been underplayed. In Davies&#x27; view, Paul replaced the Torah, the Jewish law or Law of Moses, with Christ..

In the view of Daniel Boyarin, Paula Fredriksen and other notable NT scholars cited by them, writing with lived experience of the Jewish context, Paul did not replace Torah or Halakha with Christ for Jewish believers, but simply taught gentiles that observing the noachide covenant as righteous among the nations was sufficient (along with faith in Christ), to merit a share in the world to come. This was a view shared by the Pharisees and taught in the Talmud and Maimonides (with the except of the element of faith in Christ), but denied by (mostly gentile born) Judaizers who taught conversion to Judaism as a requisite for salvation. For example, his epistle to the Romans 13 teaches the obligations of a righteous gentile under the Noachide covenant, with Romans 14-15 expansive commentary on dietary ethics.

According to Christopher Rowland, &quot;the problems with which he wrestles in his letters were probably typical of many which were facing the Christian sect during this period&quot;.

According to Krister Stendahl, the main concern of Paul&#x27;s writings on Jesus&#x27; role, and salvation by faith, is the problem of the inclusion of gentile (Greek) Torah observers into God&#x27;s covenant. The inclusion of Gentiles into early Christianity posed a problem for the Jewish identity of the early Christians. Many of the Jewish Christians were fully faithful religious Jews, only differing in their acceptance of Jesus as the Messiah. Observance of the Jewish commands, including circumcision, was regarded as a token of the membership of this covenant, and the early Jewish Christians insisted on keeping those observances. The new converts did not follow all &quot;Jewish Law&quot; and refused to be circumcised, as circumcision was considered repulsive during the period of Hellenization of the Eastern Mediterranean.

Paul objected strongly to the insistence on keeping all of the Jewish commandments, considering it a great threat to his doctrine of salvation through faith in Jesus. For Paul, Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection solved this problem of the exclusion of the gentiles from God&#x27;s covenant. &#x27;Dying for our sins&#x27; refers to the problem of gentile Torah-observers, who, despite their faithfulness, cannot fully observe commandments, including circumcision, and are therefore &#x27;sinners&#x27;, excluded from God&#x27;s covenant. Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection solved this problem of the exclusion of the gentiles from God&#x27;s covenant, as indicated by Rom 3:21-26.

Paul insists that salvation is received by the grace of God; according to Sanders, this insistence is in line with Judaism of until 200 CE, which saw God&#x27;s covenant with Israel as an act of grace of God. Observance of the Law is needed to maintain the covenant, but the covenant is not earned by observing the Law, but by the grace of God.

===Split with Jewish Christianity===

There was a slowly growing schism between Christians and Jews, rather than a sudden split. Even though it is commonly thought that Paul established a Gentile church, it took centuries for a complete break to manifest.

Irenaeus, bishop of Lyon, wrote in the latter half of the 2nd century that the Ebionites rejected Paul as an apostate from the law, using only a version of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, known as the Gospel of the Ebionites.

==Influence==
Paul had a strong influence on early Christianity, transmuting Jesus the Jewish messiah into the universal savior. This thesis is founded on differences between the views of Paul and the earliest Jewish Christianity, and also between the picture of Paul in the Acts of the Apostles and his own writings. In this view, Paul is to be taken as pro-Hellenization or Romanization.

===Scholarly views===
There are considerable differences of scholarly opinion concerning how far Paul did in fact influence Christian doctrine.

According to the 19th-century German theologian and Hegelian philosopher Ferdinand Christian Baur, founder of the Tübingen school whose view was widely influential, Paul was utterly opposed to the disciples, based upon his view that Acts was late and unreliable and who contended that Catholic Christianity was a synthesis of the views of Paul and the Judaizing church in Jerusalem. Since Adolf von Harnack, the Tübingen position has been generally abandoned. 
Ultradispensationalists such as E. W. Bullinger viewed the distinction abhorred by the Ebionites as positive and essential doctrine.

Pauline Christianity was essentially based on Rome and made use of the administrative skills which Rome had honed. Its system of organization with a single bishop for each town was, in Bart Ehrman&#x27;s view, the means by which it obtained its hegemony.

Michael Goulder wrote widely on a theory of Christian origins that sees a fundamental opposition between Paul the Apostle on one side and the Jerusalem Christians Peter and James, Jesus&#x27; brother, on the other. This has been seen as reviving Baur&#x27;s hypothesis.

===Distortion===
Some literary critics of Christianity argue that Paul distorted the original and true doctrine, or claim that Christianity is largely his invention. The former include such secular commentators as the philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche and Bertrand Russell. Nietzsche&#x27;s criticisms are based upon his moral objections to Paul&#x27;s thought. Other writers, such as Slavoj Žižek and Alain Badiou, also agree with this interpretation, but hold much more positive opinions about Paul&#x27;s theological influence.

Christian anarchists, such as Leo Tolstoy and Ammon Hennacy, believe Paul distorted Jesus&#x27; teachings. Tolstoy claims Paul was instrumental in the church&#x27;s &quot;deviation&quot; from Jesus&#x27; teaching and practices, while Hennacy believed &quot;Paul spoiled the message of Christ.&quot;

==Criticism of the &quot;Pauline Christianity&quot; thesis==
Christians themselves disagree as to how far there was tension between Paul and the Jerusalem Church. Roman Catholics, Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East, and conservative Protestants, contend that Paul&#x27;s writings were a legitimate interpretation of the Gospel. The idea that Paul invented Christianity is disputed by numerous Christian writers.

According to Christopher Rowland, Pauline Christianity is the development of thinking about Jesus in a gentile missionary context. Rowland contends that &quot;the extent of his influence on Christian thought has been overestimated&quot;, concluding that Paul did not materially alter Jesus&#x27; teachings.

Hurtado notes that Paul regarded his Christological views and the Jerusalem Church&#x27;s as essentially similar. According to Hurtado, this &quot;work[s] against the claims by some scholars that Pauline Christianity represents a sharp departure from the religiousness of Judean &#x27;Jesus movements&#x27;.&quot;

==As a pejorative term==
The pejorative use of the expressions &quot;Pauline Christianity&quot;, &quot;Paulism,&quot; or &quot;Paulanity,&quot; refers to the idea that Paul&#x27;s supporters, as a distinct group, had an undue influence on the formation of the canon of scripture. It is also sometimes used to refer to the notion that certain bishops, especially the Bishop of Rome, influenced the debates which determined the dogma of early Christianity, thus elevating a Pauline interpretation of the Gospel, to the detriment of other interpretations (including those held by the Gnostics and Marcionites).

<doc id="611835" wikidata="Q6594357" url="?curid=611835" title="List of Polish Jews">
<text>From the Middle Ages until the Holocaust, Polish Jews comprised an appreciable part of Poland&#x27;s population. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, known for its religious tolerance and described as &quot;Paradisus Judaeorum&quot; (Latin for &quot;Paradise of the Jews&quot;), had attracted tens of thousands of Jews who fled persecution from other European countries. Poland was a major spiritual and cultural center for Ashkenazi Jews.

At the start of the Second World War, Poland had the largest Jewish population in the world (over 3.3 million, some 10% of the general Polish population). The vast majority were murdered under the Nazi &quot;Final Solution&quot; mass-extermination program in the Holocaust in Poland during the German occupation; only 369,000 (11%) of Poland&#x27;s Jews survived the War.

<text>Walton Court is a housing estate in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England.

The Walton Court estate was built during the 1970s as part of a major council housing expansion. The land had formerly been farmland, and for some time the privately owned housing area was known as Walton Court Farm, after the estate, renamed Hawkslade by Estate Agents to reflect the middle class population split to the west side of Ellen Road. The majority of the roads in Walton Court that were built between the 1970s and 1980s are named after British rivers.

Walton Court stretches from the A418 Oxford Road in the north, running to the south-west of the Edinburgh playing fields and Grenville Road, as far as Ellen Road (south), where it meets the adjacent Hawkslade estate. Most of the former council-built 2-, 3- and 4-bedroomed terraced properties are now privately owned and there are a number of three-storey blocks of flats in many closes, along with a few bungalows. The properties that are not privately owned are now managed by Aylesbury Vale Housing Trust.

Although mostly housing, Walton Court also has Ashmead Combined School, a mixed, community primary school, which has approximately 475 pupils from the age of four through to the age of eleven (Nursery to Year 6), Mandeville Upper School (Year 7 to Sixth Form) and had, until 2000, Willowmead School.

On Hannon Road is the former Walton Court Shopping Centre, Walton Court Social Club and flats. The original doctors surgery within the block had outgrown itself by the beginning of the 21st century and the premises is now a nursery. A new community facility was opened adjacent to the former doctors surgery, called the Healthy Living Centre, which features a cafe, Internet facilities and regular educational classes. This has provided a new focal point to the area. A new expanded Mandeville GP Surgery has been built on the Walton Court shopping centre east car park, between the Walton Court shops and Ashmead Combined School. On the opposite side of Hannon Road is a home for the elderly.

The original shops at Walton Court Shopping Centre were arranged around a central courtyard, with flats above and service facilities below or at the rear. The design of the units attracted anti-social behaviour and the area was re-built, to update and modernise the area, during the first decade of the 21st century. The shop units were relocated into the former service bays facing Hannon Road, the old units being converted to additional flats, all arranged around the courtyard and protected with security access. The primary retail unit is operated by the Co-operative group and, as of 2017, the shopping parade boasts a branch of Boots Chemists, a charity shop, a hairdresser&#x27;s, a bookmaker&#x27;s, a vet&#x27;s practice, a launderette and a fish and chip shop. The original Walton Court Social Club has also been fully refurbished and reopened on the same site.

The estate lies roughly half a mile from the famous Stoke Mandeville Hospital. The estate therefore houses many medical, clinical and nursing staff, as well as some spinal patients now living in the community.

<text>Sir John Hayward (c. 1564 – 27 June 1627) was an English historian, lawyer and politician.

==Biography==
Hayward was born at or near Felixstowe, Suffolk, where he was educated, and afterwards went to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he was awarded BA in 1581, MA in 1584 and LLD in 1591.

In 1599 he published &quot;The First Part of the Life and Raigne of King Henrie IIII&quot; - a treatise dealing with the accession of Henry IV and the deposition of Richard II - dedicated to Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Queen Elizabeth and her advisers disliked the tone of the book and its dedication, and the queen ordered Francis Bacon to search for passages in it that might be drawn within a case of treason being compiled against the Earl of Essex. Specifically, Hayward was suspected of prophesying the failure of Essex&#x27;s military campaign in Ireland through a description of the ill-starred efforts of Richard II in that country. On 11 July 1599, following the seizure and burning of a corrected edition of the book, Hayward was interrogated before the Star Chamber. The Queen, &quot;argued that Hayward was pretending to be the author in order to shield &#x27;some more mischievous&#x27; person, and that he should be racked so that he might disclose the truth&quot;. Bacon reported of the evidence for treason, &quot;surely I find none, but for felony very many&quot;, referring to the fact that many of the sentences were stolen from Tacitus. The influence on Hayward of the works of Tacitus, which had only lately been published in English, marked a new departure in British historiography, whereby the character and behaviour of historical actors assumed a causal importance in the affairs of state. In 1600, Essex was convicted on charges of abusing his power, and in the following year of treason, whereupon he was put to death. At both trials, Hayward&#x27;s book was produced in evidence. Hayward himself was remanded to the Tower in July 1600, where he remained until after the death of Elizabeth.
When James I came to the English throne in 1603, Hayward courted the new king&#x27;s favour by publishing two pamphlets: &quot;An Answer to the first part of a certaine conference concerning succession&quot; – an argument in favour of the divine right of kings – and &quot;A Treatise of Union of England and Scotland&quot;. In 1610 Hayward was appointed one of the historiographers of the college which James founded at Chelsea. In 1613 he published his &quot;Lives of the Three Norman Kings of England&quot;, written at the request of James&#x27;s son, Prince Henry. He became Chancellor of Lichfield, Staffordshire in 1615. He was a supplicant for incorporation at the University of Oxford in 1616 and became an advocate of Doctors&#x27; Commons on 5 August 1616. From 1616 to 1627 he was Master in Chancery. He was admitted at Gray&#x27;s Inn on 1 August 1619 and was knighted on 9 November 1619.

Hayward died in 1627 and was buried in parish of St Bartholomew the Great, London. Among his manuscripts was found &quot;The Life and Raigne of King Edward VI&quot;, first published in 1630, and &quot;Certain Yeres of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Raigne&quot;, the beginning of which was printed in an edition of his &quot;Edward VI,&quot; published in 1636, but which was first published in a complete form in 1840 for the Camden Society under the editorship of John Bruce, who prefixed an introduction on the life and writings of the author. His treatise on the accession of Henry IV was reprinted in 1642. His 1603 pamphlet on the Scottish succession, was reprinted in 1683 as &quot;The Right of Succession&quot; by the friends of the Duke of York during the struggle over the Exclusion Bill.

Hayward was conscientious and diligent in obtaining information, and although his reasoning on questions of morality is often childish, his descriptions are generally graphic and vigorous. Notwithstanding his imprisonment under Elizabeth, his portrait of the qualities of the queen&#x27;s mind and person is flattering rather than detractive. He also wrote several works of a devotional character. During his confinement in the Tower, he published &quot;The Sanctuarie of a Troubled Soule&quot; (1601), which went through a dozen editions and issues. Other similar works proved equally popular, and he was acclaimed as, &quot;a learned and godly man, being better read in theological authors than in those belonging to his own profession.&quot;

<text>Aylesbury (2016 population: ) is a village in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan within the Rural Municipality of Craik No. 222 and Census Division No. 7. The village is approximately 60 km north of the City of Moose Jaw.

== History ==
Aylesbury incorporated as a village on March 31, 1910. The village was named after Aylesbury, a town in Buckinghamshire, England.

A Parrish &amp; Heimbecker grain elevator was constructed in 1906 and was the last elevator to operate in Aylesbury, up until the mid-1990s. It was demolished in October 2009.

Aylesbury School opened in 1909; in 1970 the school closed and its students were sent to the school in nearby Craik.

In the 1980s, Aylesbury received national media attention when residents rallied in an (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to convince Canada Post not to close the village&#x27;s post office. Today, the Canada Post service is contracted to the Aylesbury Hotel.

Aylesbury was the childhood home of Ashley Luther, who modeled and advocated for women&#x27;s health as Elly Mayday.

As part of a series of monuments in towns along Highway 11, a life-size ox and cart was erected outside Aylesbury in 1999. It was created by Don Wilkins, who also created metal sculptures for the neighbouring towns of Craik and Girvin.

<doc id="611854" wikidata="Q268518" url="?curid=611854" title="Usu (mortar)">
<text>An usu (, ) is a large Japanese stamp mill with a pestle called &quot;kine&quot; (, ), used to pound rice or millet.

While the function of an &quot;usu&quot; is similar to the smaller &quot;suribachi&quot; and &quot;surikogi&quot; mortars, the shape is very different, as the &quot;usu&quot; usually lacks the rough pattern in the bowl, and has a differently shaped pestle which is used in a different manner.

== Appearance ==
The &quot;usu&quot; is usually about one meter high (including pedestal) and has a diameter of ca. 30 cm. The &quot;usu&quot; is usually made of wood or stone. The &quot;kine&quot; is a long wooden mallet with a length exceeding one meter. The &quot;usu&quot; is usually operated by two people at the same time. One person swings the &quot;kine&quot; to pound the rice in a similar motion to chopping wood. It is physically demanding work and is usually done by men who often chant to keep time. Between each swing, another person puts his hand in the bowl to turn the rice. Timing is critical for safe operation of the &quot;usu&quot;.

== Use ==
The most common use of an &quot;usu&quot; is to pound cooked white rice into a very sticky mass in order to produce &quot;mochi&quot;. It is still frequently used in Japan in traditional restaurants and also sometimes in traditional, rural, or wealthier private households. Especially around New Year they are used by companies and organizations to make mochi together and distribute it to the employees to strengthen the group spirit.

<text>The Airbus A310 MRTT Multi-Role Tanker Transport is a military air-to-air refuelling, or in-flight refuelling tanker transport aircraft, capable of operating multi-role missions. The A310 MRTT tanker aircraft is a subsequent development from the earlier Airbus A310 MRT Multi-Role Transport, which was a military transport aircraft for passengers, cargo, and medical evacuation. The A310 MRT and A310 MRTT are both specialist military conversions of existing airframes of the civilian Airbus A310-300C wide-bodied passenger jet airliner.

==Airbus A310 MRTT==
===Design and development===


The Airbus A310 MRTT Multi-Role Tanker Transport is a military derivative of the Airbus A310-300C twin-jet wide-bodied jet airliner. The A310 MRTT was primarily designed for military use as a multi-role air-to-air refuelling tanker, cargo transport, passenger transport, and aeromedical evacuation (MedEvac) aircraft.

The aircraft are designed, engineered, manufactured, and modified by Airbus Industrie and EADS subsidiary Airbus Military SAS, along with their subcontractors, which included Airbus Deutschland and Lufthansa Technik. The conversion from the A310 MRT involves:
*Installation of two air-to-air refuelling (AAR) pods, one under each wing, close to the wingtip;
*Five additional centre fuel tanks or Additional Centre Tanks (ACT), providing an extra ; giving a total capacity of , or ;
*Fuel operator station (FOS), in the cockpit immediately behind the captain, to control fuel offload, cameras, military radios, and exterior lighting. For MRTT, remote surveillance of approaching / air-to-air refuelling process with a night-vision capable video system had to be developed. This system (developed by a small company from Germany called FTI Group) allows operation both with visible light, and also near-infrared radiation. The refuelling monitor was integrated in the year 2008.;
*Reinforced wings and aircraft floor;
*Minor cockpit modifications.
The design of the in-flight refuelling pod and wing reinforcements and systems was subcontracted to ITD SA, at that time part of the Industria de Turbo Propulsores (ITP) Group.

When not used as an in-flight refueller, i.e., in an air cargo role, the A310 MRTT is capable of carrying a non-fuel payload of up to , or 81,600 lb. When used in a troop transport role, the A310 MRTT can accommodate up to 214 seats. And for a mixed-use combined troop transport and cargo, it can carry 54 troops and 12 pallets. The A310 MRTT contains four separate cargo systems within the fuselage, including the main deck cargo compartment, which is loaded and unloaded via the vertically opening main deck cargo door, located on the front left (port) side. This means that main deck cargo can be loaded by overhead crane, in addition to conventional cargo loading platforms. Below deck are three more cargo compartments, and can accommodate container and palletised loads up to in height.

When used in the aero-medical MedEvac role, the A310 MRTT can accommodate up to six intensive care units, together with 56 conventional stretchers.

Operated by a crew of three: two pilots and the air-to-air refuelling (AAR) operator, the pilots are able to directly operate all functions of in-flight refuelling, even if the AAR post is deactivated. Depending on mission, the A310 MRTT can deliver up to of fuel to receiver aircraft on an operation of , or up to of fuel during a mission. All fuel to receiver aircraft is supplied directly from the centre tank, if necessary, drawing fuel from conventional fuel tanks; this is controlled automatically by the fuel management system together with the centre of gravity computer, to ensure correct fuel feed to the engines, and maintaining the correct centre of gravity in flight.

The dual hose and drogue system was supplied by Flight Refuelling Ltd (FRL) of England, and uses the Mk32B pods under each wing on pylons, close to the wingtips. Two receiver aircraft can be refuelled simultaneously, and is capable of delivering per minute.

The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) was the first customer for the MRTT, converting four of their seven existing A310 MRTs, with deliveries starting in October 2004. The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) converted two of their five existing A310 MRTs to MRTT configuration, which are known as the CC-150 Polaris in Canadian service, the first also delivered October 2004.

During June 2007, EADS delivered the first upgraded A310 MRTT with new mission avionics to the German Air Force. This new mission avionics suite facilitated the allocation of the upgraded A310 MRTT to NATO Reaction Forces.

While the original and current A310 MRTTs rely on probe and drogue for air-to-air refuelling, EADS has invested $90m in research and development of a flying boom refuelling system such as that used by the United States Air Force (USAF). They are now able to offer air tankers from the A310 with air-to-air refuelling pods to the larger A330 MRTT equipped with refuelling booms. When installed, the flying boom system can deliver fuel to receiver aircraft at a rate of per minute, and is supplied by two hose drum units (HDU) centrally mounted side by side in the rear fuselage.

The A310 MRTT is 30% smaller by MTOW than the newer A330 MRTT. Since the production of A310 airframes was discontinued in 2007, the air-to-air refuelling conversion can only be made on existing refurbished airliners, or as an upgrade to A310 MRTs already used by air forces (the option taken by Germany and Canada). As an air tanker, it has a similar fuel capacity to the KC-135R. Because of the larger passenger cabin, it is much more flexible, offering good capacity for cargo, troop transport, VIP transport, or other uses; and lacking only the capacity to land on rough strips to qualify as a strategic transport. Airbus hopes to sell it to some of the countries that need to replace the aging Boeing 707s they use as tankers.

The first operational use with the German Luftwaffe took place on , when three German Eurofighter Typhoons of Jagdgeschwader 73 &quot;Steinhoff&quot; (30+23, 30+25, and 30+38), led by Colonel Andreas Schick, were refuelled en-route by an A310 MRTT tanker aircraft during their deployment from Laage Airbase (), Rostock, Germany, to Yelahanka Air Force Station, near Bangalore, India. Despite not yet receiving final approval of in-flight refuelling operations by the German authorities, this air-to-air refuelling mission was sanctioned as part of the A310 MRTTs &#x27;operational testing phase&#x27; for in-flight refuelling, and consisted of a flight route of nearly , including a stopover at the Al Dahfra airbase () in the United Arab Emirates. The objective of the deployment to India was to demonstrate the Eurofighter in a competition for Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA), against competition from the Mikoyan MiG-35, the Saab Gripen, the Lockheed Martin F-16, the Boeing F-18E / F, and the Dassault Rafale.

Pakistan has also ordered MRTT capability built on an A310, although the aircraft is no longer in production.

<doc id="611857" wikidata="Q1269712" url="?curid=611857" title="Red spurfowl">
<text>The red spurfowl (Galloperdix spadicea) is a member of the pheasant family and is endemic to India. It is a bird of forests, and is quite secretive despite its size. It has a distinctive call and is often hard to see except for a few seconds when it flushes from the undergrowth. It appears reddish and like a long-tailed partridge. The bare skin around the eye is reddish. The legs of both males and females have one or two spurs, which give them their name.

==Taxonomy==
The red spurfowl was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the grouse like birds in the genus &quot;Tetrao&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Tetrao spadiceus&quot;. Gmelin based his description on Pierre Sonnerat&#x27;s &quot;La perdrix rouge de Madagascar&quot;. Gmelin specified the type locality as Madagascar. This is an error, the species is found in India. The red spurfowl is now placed with painted spurfowl and the Sri Lanka spurfowl in the genus &quot;Galloperdix&quot; that was introduced in 1845 by the English zoologist Edward Blyth. The genus name combines the Latin word &quot;gallus&quot; for a &quot;farmyard cock&quot; with &quot;perdix&quot; meaning &quot;partridge&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;spadicea&quot; is from Latin &quot;spadix&quot;, &quot;spadicis&quot; meaning &quot;chestnut-coloured&quot; or &quot;date-coloured&quot;.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;G. s. spadicea&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – west Nepal and north, central India
* &quot;G. s. caurina&quot; Blanford, 1898 – Aravalli red spurfowl. Aravalli Range of southern Rajasthan (west India)
* &quot;G. s. stewarti&quot; Baker, ECS, 1919 – central, south Kerala (south India)

In colouration, the females show clinal variation becoming darker towards the south of their range. The name used in Marathi was recorded as &quot;Kokee-tree&quot; and is probably onomatopoeic.

==Description==

Overall reddish-brown, this large partridge-like bird has a somewhat long tail. The upper parts are brown with dark barring while the face and neck are more grey in the male. The underside is rufous with dark markings and both sexes have a red facial skin patch and red legs with one or two spurs (rarely three or four while females may have none). Downy chicks have an unmarked cinnamon brown head, a dark brown band along the back bordered by creamy stripes edged with thin lines of dark brown. The male of the distinctive Kerala race, &quot;G. s. stewarti&quot; has all-chestnut plumage, including the head feathers. Both sexes have long feathers on the crown that can be erected into a crest.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is found in scrub, dry and moist-deciduous forests often in hilly country. They are found south of the Ganges across India. They prefer areas with good undergrowth including those formed by the invasive &quot;Lantana&quot;.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Red spurfowl usually forage in small parties of three to five. When walking around, the tail is sometimes held vertical as in domestic fowl. They are quite silent in the day but call in the mornings and evenings. They feed on fallen seeds, berries, mollusks and insects apart from swallowing grit to aid digestion. When flushed, the usually fly a short distance and stay in well-defined territories throughout the year. They roost in trees.

The calls include a distinct &quot;ker-wick...kerwick...&quot; and harsh &quot;karr...karrr...&quot; notes. The Marathi name &quot;Kokatri&quot; is echoic in origin.

The breeding season is January to June, mainly before the rains. A ground nesting bird, it lays 3-5 eggs in a scrape. Males are monogynous which usually indicates greater male investment in parental duties but they do not incubate. Males have been observed to distract the attention of predators when females with chicks are nearby.

The widespread nematode &quot;Heterakis gallinae&quot; has been recorded in the species in captivity while Ixodid ticks have been noted in the wild. A species of helminth &quot;Lerouxinema lerouxi&quot; has been described with the red spurfowl as type host. Keratinophilic fungi such as &quot;Ctenomyces serratus&quot; have been noted from the species.

<text>The Zündapp Janus is a microcar model made by Zündapp in Germany between 1957 and 1958, as the only car ever built by the company.

==Dornier Delta==

Claude Dornier was always trying to minimize the dependency of his company Dornier Flugzeugwerke on building aircraft, by diversification into other areas. After World War II, and the Allied ban on aircraft production in Germany until the late 1950s, Claude diversified the company&#x27;s production and encouraged his son Claudius to find new areas. As a result, Claudius designed and developed a four-seater car, where the two front and two rear passengers sat back to back, for optimal use of the enclosed space. A prototype was built and tested, which was named Dornier Delta. The company had not built a car before, and economic calculations showed that the volume of sales required would make it uneconomical for the company to make the car using its existing facilities.

Zündapp was a motorcycle maker, but in 1954 decided to make a more weatherproof vehicle. They looked for partners who could design such a vehicle, and approached Kroboth, Brütsch, and Fuldamobil before settling on the ready-developed vehicle from Dornier.

== Zündapp Janus ==

Under a commercial agreement, Dornier licensed Zündapp to produce and market the car. With the goal of producing a &quot;quality bubble car&quot;, the concept was developed further, using Zündapp&#x27;s engineering input.
The resulting novel design featured a front-opening door for access to the front seat, as well as a rear-opening door for access to the rear-facing rear seat. This &quot;coming or going&quot; design was given the name of the Roman god, Janus, usually pictured having two faces: one looks forward while the other one looks back. The car was powered by a mid-mounted two-stroke, single-cylinder, engine unique to the Janus, developing , enabling a top speed of . The front suspension was of the leading arm-type that proved to be very comfortable, and in the rear the car had a swing axle. The company added four individually mounted ventilated brake drums, operated via hydraulics.

Production started in June 1957, but with little sales success, only 1,731 cars were made in the first six months.
One reason was the suboptimal handling: With an engine that was much lighter than the rear passengers, the advantages usually associated with a mid-engine configuration in racing and sports cars did not apply, and the centre of gravity changed a lot depending on how many passengers were present.
Secondly, the car lacked the most modern elements seen on competitors&#x27; cars, and was not low priced.
By mid-1958, having made only a total of 6,902 cars, Zündapp abandoned the project and sold the factory to Bosch.

===In popular culture===
In the animated feature film &quot;Cars 2&quot;, Professor Zündapp is based on a 1957 Zündapp Janus.

==Dornier Delta II==
During the mid-1960s, Dornier developed the Delta II with Hymer AG. The vehicle could carry up to six passengers and offered two sleeping places for camping. The development never got beyond the prototype stage.

<text>Stonetown of Zanzibar (), also known as , is the old part of Zanzibar City, the main city of Zanzibar, in Tanzania. The newer portion of the city is known as Ng&#x27;ambo, Swahili for &#x27;the other side&#x27;. Stone Town is located on the western coast of Unguja, the main island of the Zanzibar Archipelago. Former capital of the Zanzibar Sultanate, and flourishing centre of the spice trade as well as the Indian Ocean slave trade in the 19th century, it retained its importance as the main city of Zanzibar during the period of the British protectorate. When Tanganyika and Zanzibar joined each other to form the United Republic of Tanzania, Zanzibar kept a semi-autonomous status, with Stone Town as its local government seat.

Stone Town is a city of prominent historical and artistic importance in East Africa. Its architecture, mostly dating back to the 19th century, reflects the diverse influences underlying the Swahili culture, giving a unique mixture of Arab, Persian, Indian and European elements. For this reason, the town was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000.

Due to its heritage, Stone Town is also a major visitor attraction in Tanzania, and a large part of its economy depends on tourism-related activities.

==Overview==

The heart of Stone Town mostly consists of a maze of narrow alleys lined by houses, shops, bazaars and mosques. Since most streets are too narrow for cars, the town is crowded with bicycles and motorbikes. The seafront has wider streets and larger, more regularly placed buildings.

Stone Town&#x27;s architecture has a number of distinctive features, as a result of Arab, Persian, Indian, European, and African traditions mixing together. The name &quot;Stone Town&quot; comes from the ubiquitous use of coral stone as the main construction material; this stone gives the town a characteristic, reddish warm colour. Traditional buildings have a &quot;baraza&quot;, a long stone bench along the outside walls; this is used as an elevated sidewalk if heavy rains make the streets impracticable, or otherwise as benches to sit down, rest, socialize. Another key feature of most buildings is large verandas protected by carved wooden balustrades. The best-known feature of Zanzibari houses are the finely decorated wooden doors, with rich carvings and bas-reliefs, sometimes with big brass studs of Indian tradition. Two main types of doors can be distinguished: those of Indian style have rounded tops, while those in the Omani Arab style are rectangular. Carvings are often Islamic in content (for example, many consist of verses of the Qur&#x27;an), but other symbolism is occasionally used, e.g., Indian lotus flowers as emblems of prosperity.

Stone Town is punctuated with major historical buildings, several of which are found on the seafront; these include former palaces of the sultans, fortifications, churches, mosques, and other institutional buildings.

While Stone Town was included in UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Sites in 2000, this designation does not provide complete protection for the town&#x27;s heritage. Despite the establishment of a Conservation Authority, about 80% of the 1,709 buildings of Stone Town are in a deteriorating condition. As coral stone is very friable, frequent maintenance is needed for most of these buildings. Some major restoration projects (especially on the seafront) have been done in recent times by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC).

==History==

=== Medieval Zanzibar ===

A Greco-Roman text between the 1st and 3rd centuries, the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot;, mentioned the island of &quot;Menuthias&quot; (), which is probably Unguja. Zanzibar, like the nearby coast, was settled by Bantu-speakers at the outset of the first millennium. Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the north-west coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century CE at the latest. The considerable amount of daub found indicates timber buildings, and shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site. There is evidence for limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century. The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicate a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture. The coastal towns, including those on Zanzibar, appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean trade at this early period. Trade rapidly increased in importance and quantity beginning in the mid-8th century and by the close of the 10th century Zanzibar was one of the central Swahili trading towns.

Shangani, the original fishing town that developed into Stone Town, was a small, largely unimportant Swahili site founded in the 11th century. Bigger towns at Unguja Ukuu, Kizimkazi, and Tumbatu were the island&#x27;s powers from the 8th to the 16th century. The Portuguese built a church at Shangani in the early 16th century, and the Queen of northern Unguja had a house built there in the mid-17th century. When the Portuguese were ousted by Zanzibaris and Pembans in the 17th century, local patricians invited the Sultan of Oman to wield political power in exchange for defense against Portuguese reprisals. Part of the Portuguese church was built into the Omani fort, which housed roughly fifty soldiers. The Sultan also appointed a local governor, but political authority was still largely vested in the Mwinyi Mkuu, at this time Queen Fatima.

Excavations at nearby Pemba Island, but especially at Shanga in the Lamu Archipelago, provide the clearest picture of architectural development. Houses were originally built with timber (c. 1050) and later in mud with coral walls (c. 1150). The houses were continually rebuilt with more permanent materials. By the 13th century, houses were built with stone, and bonded with mud, and the 14th century saw the use of lime to bond stone. Only the wealthier patricians would have had stone and lime built houses, the strength of the materials allowing for flat roofs, while the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those from the 11th and 12th centuries. According to Tom Middleton and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses have no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture. While much of Zanzibar Town&#x27;s architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili, and Zanzibari, architecture before the 15th century.

=== Omani Dominion ===

Stone Town is located along a natural harbour and the first Europeans to set foot on the island of Zanzibar were the Portuguese. The Portuguese ruled the island for over two centuries and began constructing Stone Town&#x27;s first stone structure, the Old Fort. However, towards the end of the 17th century the Sultanate of Oman took over the island and completed the fort to prevent future attacks. The first stone houses in Stone Town probably began to be built in the early 1800s, gradually replacing an earlier fishing village around the Old Fort. At the time the Sultanate of Oman controlled the Zanzibar Archipelago, Mombasa and the Swahili coast.

In 1824, Sultan Said bin Sultan moved his seat from Muscat, Oman, to Stone Town, which thus entered an era of quick development as the new capital of the Sultanate of Oman and Zanzibar. With the British outlawing the slave trade in the Indian Ocean, the Sultanate&#x27;s fortunes crashed. The Muscat economy was in shambles and many Omanis migrated to Zanzibar. The increase in the Arab population on the island facilitated further growth and more buildings began to spring up in the town. Furthermore, grand royal structures like the House of Wonders and the Sultan&#x27;s Palace were also built. In 1861, as a consequence of a war of succession within the Omani royal family, Zanzibar and Oman were separated, with Zanzibar becoming an independent sultanate under Sultan Majid bin Said.

In the 19th century Stone Town flourished as a trading centre. It was especially renowned for the commerce of spices (mostly cloves) and slaves. Around middle of the century, the sultanate had a close relationship with the British; David Livingstone, for example, is known to have stayed in Stone Town in 1866 while he was preparing his final expedition into the interior of East Africa. In the same period, several immigrant communities from Oman, Persia and India formed as a consequence of the town&#x27;s intense commercial activity. The Sultan of Zanzibar encouraged immigration of foreign traders who became very wealthy and settled in the city who brought diversity to the city&#x27;s architecture.

=== Colonial control ===

In the last decades of the century, the Sultans of Zanzibar gradually lost their possessions in mainland East Africa to the German Empire and the United Kingdom. In 1890, with the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty, Zanzibar itself became a British protectorate. In 1896, a sudden rebellion of the Zanzibari Omanis against the British rule led to the Anglo-Zanzibar War, which is remembered as the shortest war in history: the Sultan surrendered after 45 minutes of naval bombardment of Stone Town by the Royal Navy.

During the period of British protection, the Sultan still retained some power and Stone Town remained a relatively important trading centre for the informal trade. Though the town previously had a small railway the British constructed a railway from the Town to Bububu village. The British did not fund major developments in the town and allowed the sultan to manage the islands affairs from Stone Town. The British gave privileges to Mombasa and Dar es Salaam as their trading stations in East Africa.

=== Zanzibar Revolution ===
In 1964, Stone Town was the theatre of the Zanzibar Revolution, which brought about the removal of the sultan and the birth of a socialist government led by the Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP). More than 20,000 people were killed and refugees, especially Arabs and Indians, escaped the island as a consequence of the revolution. The Arabs and Indians left behind everything they had and the ASP quickly occupied old homes and converted them into public buildings. In 1964, when Tanganyika and Zanzibar combined to form Tanzania, Stone Town kept its role as a capital and government seat for Zanzibar, which was declared a semi-autonomous part of the new nation.
==Geography==
Stone Town is located roughly in the middle of the west coast of Unguja, on a small promontory protruding into the Zanzibar Channel. The closest major settlement on the Tanzanian coast, opposite Stone Town, is Bagamoyo (to the south-west). Stone Town is part of Zanzibar City, which also includes the &#x27;New City&#x27; of Ng&#x27;ambo (&quot;the Other Side&quot;), which mostly extends in the interior of Unguja to the south-east. The dividing line between Stone Town and Ng&#x27;ambo is Creek Road, later renamed to Benjamin Mkapa Road, marking the west side of the now reclaimed creek that separated them.

===Historical buildings and sites===

#The House of Wonders (or &quot;Palace of Wonders&quot;, also known as &quot;Beit-al-Ajaib&quot;), in located on the Mizingani Road along the Stone Town seafront, and is probably the most well-known landmarks of Stone Town. It was built in 1883 and restored after the Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896. Formerly the Sultan&#x27;s residence, it became the seat of the Afro-Shirazi Party after the revolution. It was the first building in Zanzibar to have electricity as well as the first building in East Africa to have a lift. Since 2000, its interior has been dedicated to a museum on Swahili and Zanzibar culture. In December 2020, during renovations, a large part of the building collapsed in a major accident.
#The Old Fort (&quot;Ngome Kongwe&quot; in Swahili), adjacent to the House of Wonders, is a heavy stone fortress that was built in the 17th century by the Omanis. Also known as the Omani fort it was built by the early rulers to protect the city from European invasions. It has a roughly square shape and the internal courtyard is now a cultural centre with shops, workshops, and a small arena where live dance and music shows are held daily. The fort location is also used for the Zanzibar International Film Festival.
#The Old Dispensary (or &quot;Ithnashiri Dispensary&quot;) was built from 1887 to 1894 by a wealthy Indian trader, to serve as a charity hospital for the poor but was later used as a dispensary. It is one of the most finely decorated buildings of Stone Town, with large carved wooden balconies, stained-glass windows, and neo-classical stucco adornments. After falling into decay in the 1970s and 1980s, the building was accurately restored by the AKTC.
#The Palace Museum (also known as the &quot;Sultan&#x27;s Palace&quot;, &quot;Beit el-Sahel&quot; in Arab) is another former sultan&#x27;s palace, on the seafront, to the north of the House of Wonders. It was built in late 19th century and now hosts a museum about the daily life of the Zanzibari royal family, including items that belonged to Sayyida Salme, a former Zanzibar princess who fled to relocate in Europe with her husband.
#The Anglican cathedral of Christ Church, on Mkunazini Road, was built at the end of the 19th century by Edward Steere, third bishop of Zanzibar. The cathedral was constructed in a large area at the centre of Stone Town that previously hosted the biggest slave market of Zanzibar; the place was deliberately chosen to celebrate the end of slavery, and the altar was in the exact spot where the main whipping post of the market used to be. A monument to the slaves, as well as a museum on the history of slavery, are besides the church.
#The Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. Joseph was built by French missionaries between 1893 and 1897. The design of the church was based on that of the Marseille Cathedral, its façade, with two high spires, is one of the most well-known landmarks of Stone Town and can be seen from a distance when sailing into the harbor. The church is still operational today and holds regular mass on Sundays.
#The Forodhani Gardens are a small park in the main sea walk of Stone Town, right in front of the Old Fort and the House of Wonders. The garden was recently restored for 3 million dollars by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. Every evening after sunset the gardens host a popular, tourist-oriented market selling grilled seafood and other Zanzibari recipes which attracts both tourists and locals

==Transportation==
The streets in Stone Town are very narrow and almost getting anywhere within the town must be done on foot. The narrow streets provide shade and almost everything is accessible from within the town. However, on slightly wider roads historically bicycles and now most recently motor cycles are used to transport people and goods. The town is accessible from Zanzibar and the rest of the region through three possible ports of entry.

The main form of public transport in Zanzibar are the daladala share taxis; and the main station is located by the Darajani Market. Daladalas connect Stone Town to several island locations, such as Bububu (a village north of Stone Town), the airport, the Amaan Stadium, Jangombe, and Magomeni, Zanzibar. For longer trips, &quot;mabasi&quot; (Swahili for &quot;bus&quot;, singular &quot;basi&quot;) are available, which are trucks adapted for passenger transport. The main &quot;mabasi&quot; station is also close to the Market and the &quot;mabasi&quot; network stretch across the entire island and is the cheapest form of long-distance transit.

The main Zanzibar island harbour is in the heart of Stone Town and regular ferries from Dar es Salaam and Pemba connect the town to the mainland. The town is also in close proximity to the Island&#x27;s major airport. Zanzibar Airport, south of Stone Town has flights to mainland Tanzania (especially Arusha and Dar es Salaam) as well as other African main airports such as Nairobi, Mombasa, and Johannesburg.

== Climate ==

Stone Town along with the entire Zanzibar Archipelago experiences a similar climate throughout the year. The island has a hot tropical weather all year round with the hottest months being February and March and the cooler months being July and August. During most months of the year there is significant rainfall with a long rain season spanning from March–May and a shorter rain season from November–December. The lesser dry season occurs between December–February and May–August and consequently is the peak tourist season due to beach tourism on the island.

<text>The Airbus CC-150 Polaris is the designation for the civilian Airbus A310-300s which have been converted into multi-purpose, long-range jet aircraft for passenger, freight or medical transport and mid-air refueling for the Royal Canadian Air Force.

==Design and development==
The four Airbus aircraft that make up the fleet were originally civilian airliners purchased and operated by Wardair. First delivered in 1987 and 1988, they were transferred to Canadian Airlines when the two airlines merged in 1989. The aircraft were subsequently sold to the Canadian Armed Forces and converted for military use, entering service between December 1992 and August 1993. Four of the five aircraft, numbered 15002 to 15005, were converted to the &quot;Combi&quot;-Freighter standard with a reinforced floor and side opening cargo door. The fifth, 15001, was modified as a VIP transport aircraft for government executive transport.

The CC-150 replaced the Boeing CC-137 (converted Boeing 707) as a strategic transport when the final transport-configured CC-137s were retired in 1997.

===Tanker conversion===
In 2008, two of the five CC-150s were converted to air-to-air refuelling tankers with a new military mission avionics package for the CF-18 fleet as part of the Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) program. The Polaris tankers are capable of ferrying a flight of four CF-18 Hornets non-stop across the Atlantic Ocean, off-loading 80,000 pounds of fuel to the receiving aircraft over a 2,500 nautical mile (4,630 km) leg. The MRTT program was initiated because of a German Air Force requirement and provided a cost-effective solution for the Canadian Forces. The converted aircraft have been designated CC-150T. The tankers have hose-drogue pods under the wings.

The RCAF uses converted C-130s, RCAF designation CC-130H(T), for tactical air-to-air refuelling but is limited when deploying CF-18s overseas, as they are better served by a strategic air-to-air refuelling platform. As a result of the CC-150&#x27;s MRTT conversion, Canada regained its strategic air-to-air refuelling capability, lost when the final tanker-configured CC-137s were retired in 1997 (13703 &amp; 13704 were modified with Beech refuelling kits in mid-1972 in support of the CF-5 tactical fighter).

The first converted CC-150T completed its acceptance trials in May 2008.

==Operational history==
The Polaris is classified as a strategic airlifter by the Royal Canadian Air Force. As a tanker, the CC-150 has a similar fuel capacity to the KC-135; it is more flexible because of the large cabin, offering good capacity for cargo, troop transport, VIP transport or other uses, but lacks the oversize cargo capacity and ability to operate from austere locations. The Canadian Armed Forces rely on other heavy lift cargo aircraft (such as the C-17 Globemaster) for these kinds of operations.

The five CC-150s are operated by 437 Transport Squadron at CFB Trenton, Ontario. They served in United Nations, Red Cross and NATO initiatives, including operations in Afghanistan.

In 2011, two CC-150T air-to-air refuelling tankers were deployed to support Canadian CF-18 fighter jets enforcing the no-fly zone over Libya under Operation Mobile and Operation Unified Protector.

The initial purchase from Canadian Airlines in 1992 included a support contract for service of the aircraft for a fixed number of flying hours. Air Canada acquired the CC-150 service contract when it purchased Canadian Airlines in 2000, and through a series of subsequent corporate restructurings, spawned the CC-150 service contract to Air Canada Technical Services (ACTS), then Aveos Fleet Performance. Following the collapse of Aveos Fleet Performance in March 2012, the Government of Canada awarded a one-year interim contract to L3 Communications to support the fleet of CC-150 aircraft until Canada could award a longer term aircraft maintenance contract through a competitive procurement process.

On July 22, 2023, the CC-150 15003 suffered severe damage to its tail in a rollaway collision with a French Air Force Airbus A400M parked nearby. In November 2023, the Royal Canadian Air Force made the decision to scrap the aircraft in Guam, where it has been parked since the accident occurred. Repair costs were estimated between $7.9 and $28.5 million.

===Use as VIP transport===
The call sign of the VIP-configured CC-150 is known officially as CAN Force One. The decision to outfit one of the five CC-150s as a VIP transport intended for use by the Prime Minister of Canada, made while Brian Mulroney held office, was politically controversial. The $56 million in upgrades ($3 million of that went towards a private compartment with a dining room, entertainment area, fold-out beds and a shower) were criticized as a needless extravagance during a time of government budgetary challenges by then-Leader of the Opposition Jean Chrétien, who labelled the aircraft a &quot;flying Taj Mahal&quot;. Chrétien became Prime Minister soon thereafter and tried and failed to sell the aircraft; he refused to use the CC-150 during his ensuing 11 years in office. The interior was downgraded to a smaller, less lavish VIP cabin and the aircraft offered limited communications capability.

Subsequent refits to and from use as a troop transport resulted in much of the VIP amenities being downgraded. The CC-150 returned to use as official transport for the prime minister under Paul Martin in 2004.

In 2011, it emerged that since early 2009 the office of Prime Minister Stephen Harper had repeatedly requested that the VIP-configured CC-150, aircraft #01, be repainted from the gun-metal military paint scheme it shared with the other CC-150s to a specialized paint scheme. The Department of National Defence, including Minister Peter MacKay, had resisted this request, noting that it was contrary to its multi-role nature and would compromise the aircraft&#x27;s potential to safely transport personnel into a combat zone. In 2013, the VIP-configured CC-150 was repainted during scheduled heavy maintenance at a cost of $50,000. The new scheme, predominantly white with significant quantities of blue and smaller amounts of red, was criticized by opposition politicians, who alleged the repainting was intended to give prominence to the then-governing Conservative Party of Canada&#x27;s traditional blue colour.

In recent years, various mechanical problems have occurred. In October 2016, a flap issue forced the aircraft to return to Ottawa 30 minutes after takeoff while Trudeau was en route to Belgium to sign the Canada Europe free trade deal. In March 2018, Prime Minister Trudeau&#x27;s trip to India was delayed because of a mechanical issue during a refuelling stop in Rome.

In December 2019, the VIP CC-150 suffered significant structural damage to the nose and right engine cowling. While being towed by contracted personnel at CFB Trenton, it rolled into the back wall of a hangar. The aircraft was scheduled to remain out of service until August 2020, but the grounding was extended due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was returned to service in March 2021.

In September 2023, Trudeau&#x27;s return from the G20 summit in India was postponed due to &quot;technical issues&quot; with the aircraft. Another CC-150 was sent from CFB Trenton to pick up Trudeau.

===Replacement===
In 2021 the Government of Canada began an effort to replace all five CC-150 Polaris aircraft. The replacement tender is expected to cost US$5 billion. Early bid candidates included the Airbus A330 MRTT and the Boeing KC-46, but the latter has since been dropped. On 14 July 2022, Canada announced that it has finalized a contract to acquire two A330-200 aircraft as the first two aircraft for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) that will provide a strategic transport and air-to-air refuelling role — currently fulfilled by the fleet of five CC-150 Polaris aircraft — as part of the Strategic Tanker Transport Capability (STTC) project. The two A330 aircraft are former civilian airliners owned by International Airfinance Corporation. The new fleet will include four new and five used aircraft that are being outfitted to feature the same capabilities.
