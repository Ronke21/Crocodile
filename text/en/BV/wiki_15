<text>Bernardino de Sahagún ( – 5 February 1590) was a Franciscan friar, missionary priest and pioneering ethnographer who participated in the Catholic evangelization of colonial New Spain (now Mexico). Born in Sahagún, Spain, in 1499, he journeyed to New Spain in 1529. He learned Nahuatl and spent more than 50 years in the study of Aztec beliefs, culture and history. Though he was primarily devoted to his missionary task, his extraordinary work documenting indigenous worldview and culture has earned him the title as &quot;the first anthropologist.&quot; He also contributed to the description of Nahuatl, the imperial language of the Aztec Empire. He translated the Psalms, the Gospels, and a catechism into Nahuatl.

Sahagún is perhaps best known as the compiler of the &quot;Historia general de las cosas de la Nueva España—&quot;in English, &quot;General History of the Things of New Spain—&quot;(hereinafter referred to as &quot;Historia general&quot;). The most famous extant manuscript of the &quot;Historia general&quot; is the &quot;Florentine Codex&quot;. It is a codex consisting of 2,400 pages organized into twelve books, with approximately 2,500 illustrations drawn by native artists using both native and European techniques. The alphabetic text is bilingual in Spanish and Nahuatl on opposing folios, and the pictorials should be considered a third kind of text. It documents the culture, religious cosmology (worldview), ritual practices, society, economics, and history of the Aztec people, and in Book 12 gives an account of the conquest of the Aztec Empire from the Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco point of view. In the process of putting together the &quot;Historia general&quot;, Sahagún pioneered new methods for gathering ethnographic information and validating its accuracy. The &quot;Historia general&quot; has been called &quot;one of the most remarkable accounts of a non-Western culture ever composed,&quot; and Sahagún has been called the father of American ethnography. In 2015, his work was declared a World Heritage by the UNESCO.

==Education in Spain==
Fray Bernardino was born Bernardino de Rivera (Ribera, Ribeira) 1499 in Sahagún, Spain. He attended the University of Salamanca, where he was exposed to the currents of Renaissance humanism. During this period, the university at Salamanca was strongly influenced by Erasmus, and was a center for Spanish Franciscan intellectual life. It was there that he joined the Order of Friars Minor or Franciscans. He was probably ordained around 1527. Entering the order he followed the Franciscan custom of changing his family name for the name of his birth town, becoming Bernardino de Sahagún.

Spanish conquistadores led by Hernán Cortés conquered the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan (on the site of present-day Mexico City) in 1521, and Franciscan missionaries followed shortly thereafter in 1524. Sahagún was not in this first group of twelve friars, which arrived in New Spain in 1524. An account, in both Spanish and Nahuatl, of the disputation that these Franciscan friars held in Tenochtitlan soon after their arrival was made by Sahagún in 1564, in order to provide a model for future missionaries. Thanks to his own academic and religious reputation, Sahagún was recruited in 1529 to join the missionary effort in New Spain. He would spend the next 61 years there.

==Evangelization of New Spain==

During the Age of Discovery, 1450–1700, Iberian rulers took a great interest in the missionary evangelization of indigenous peoples encountered in newly discovered lands. In Catholic Spain and Portugal, the missionary project was funded by Catholic monarchs under the patronato real issued by the pope to ensure Catholic missionary work was part of a broader project of conquest and colonization.

The decades after the Spanish conquest witnessed a dramatic transformation of indigenous culture, a transformation with a religious dimension that contributed to the creation of Mexican culture. People from both the Spanish and indigenous cultures held a wide range of opinions and views about what was happening in this transformation.

The evangelization of New Spain was led by Franciscan, Dominican and Augustinian friars. These religious orders established the Catholic Church in colonial New Spain, and directed it during most of the 16th century. The Franciscans in particular were enthusiastic about the new land and its people.

Franciscan friars who went to the New World were motivated by a desire to preach the Gospel to new peoples. Many Franciscans were convinced that there was great religious meaning in the discovery and evangelization of these new peoples. They were astonished that such new peoples existed and believed that preaching to them would bring about the return of Christ and the end of time, a set of beliefs called millenarianism. Concurrently, many of the friars were discontented with the corruption of European society, including, at times, the leadership of the Catholic Church. They believed that New Spain was the opportunity to revive the pure spirit of primitive Christianity. During the first decades of the Spanish conquest of Mesoamerica, many indigenous people converted to Christianity, at least superficially.

The friars employed a large number of indigenous Americans for the construction of churches and monasteries, not only for the construction itself, but also as artists, painters and sculptors, and their works were used for decoration and evangelization. In this process, the native artists added many references to their customs and beliefs: flowers, birds or geometric symbols. Friars thought the images were decorative, but the Natives recognized their strong religious connotation. The mixture of Christian and Indian symbols has been described as Indocristiano or Indochristian art. Inspired by their Franciscan spirituality and Catholic humanism, the friars organized the indigenous peoples into utopian communities. There were massive waves of indigenous peoples converting to Catholicism, as measured by hundreds of thousands of baptisms in massive evangelization centers set up by the friars.

In its initial stages, the colonial evangelization project appeared quite successful, despite the sometimes antagonizing behavior of the conquistadores. However, the indigenous people did not express their Christian faith in the ways expected by the missionary friars. Many still practiced their pre-European contact religious rituals and maintained their ancestral beliefs, much as they had for hundreds or thousands of years, while also participating in Catholic worship, a practice known as multiple religious belonging. The friars had disagreements over how best to approach this problem, as well as disagreements about their mission, and how to determine success.

==At the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco==

Sahagún helped found the first European school of higher education in the Americas, the Colegio Imperial de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco in 1536, in what is now Mexico City. This later served as a base for his own research activities, as he recruited former students to work with him. The college contributed to the blending of Spanish and indigenous cultures in what is now Mexico.

It became a vehicle for evangelization of students, as well as the recruiting and training of native men to the Catholic clergy; it was a center for the study of native languages, especially Nahuatl. The college contributed to the establishment of Catholic Christianity in New Spain and became an important institution for cultural exchange. Sahagún taught Latin and other subjects during its initial years. Other friars taught grammar, history, religion, scripture, and philosophy. Native leaders were recruited to teach about native history and traditions, leading to controversy among colonial officials who were concerned with controlling the indigenous populations. During this period, Franciscans who affirmed the full humanity and capacity of indigenous people were perceived as suspect by colonial officials and the Dominican Order. Some of the latter competitors hinted that the Friars were endorsing idolatry. The friars had to be careful in pursuing and defining their interactions with indigenous people.

Sahagún was one of several friars at the school who wrote notable accounts of indigenous life and culture. 
Two notable products of the scholarship at the college are the first New World &quot;herbal,&quot; and a map of what is now the Mexico City region. An &quot;herbal&quot; is a catalog of plants and their uses, including descriptions and their medicinal applications. Such an herbal, the &quot;Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis&quot;, was written in Latin by Juan Badianus de la Cruz, an Aztec teacher at the college, perhaps with help from students or other teachers. In this document, the plants are drawn, named and presented according to the Aztec system of organization. The text describes where the plants grow and how herbal medicines can be made from them. This &quot;herbal&quot; may have been used to teach indigenous medicine at the college. The &quot;Mapa de Santa Cruz&quot; shows the urban areas, networks of roads and canals, pictures of activities such as fishing and farming, and the broader landscape context. The herbal and the map show the influence of both the Spanish and the Aztec cultures, and by their structure and style convey the blending of these cultures.

==Work as a missionary==

In addition to teaching, Sahagún spent several extended periods outside of Mexico City, including in Tlalmanalco (1530–32); Xochimilco (1535), where he is known to have performed a marriage; Tepepulco (1559–61), Huexotzinco, and also evangelized, led religious services, and provided religious instruction. He was first and foremost a missionary, whose goal was to bring the peoples of the New World to the Catholic faith. He spent much time with the indigenous people in remote rural villages, as a Catholic priest, teacher, and missionary.

Sahagún was a gifted linguist, one of several Franciscans. As an Order, the Franciscans emphasized evangelization of the indigenous peoples in their own languages. Sahagún began his study of Nahuatl while traveling across the Atlantic, learning from indigenous nobles who were returning to the New World from Spain. Later he was recognized as one of the Spaniards most proficient in this language. Most of his writings reflect his Catholic missionary interests, and were designed to help churchmen preach in Nahuatl, or translate the Bible into Nahuatl, or provide religious instruction to indigenous peoples. Among his works in Nahuatl was a translation of the Psalms and a catechism. He likely composed his &quot;Psalmodia Christiana&quot; in Tepepolco when he was gathering material for the &quot;Primeros Memoriales&quot;. It was published in 1583 by Pedro Ocharte, but circulated in New Spain prior to that in order to replace with Christian texts the songs and poetry of the Nahuas. His curiosity drew him to learn more about the worldview of the Aztecs, and his linguistic skills enabled him to do so. Thus, Sahagún had the motivation, skills and disposition to study the people and their culture. He conducted field research in the indigenous language of Nahuatl. In 1547, he collected and recorded &quot;huehuetlatolli&quot; (Nahuatl: &quot;Words of the old men&quot;), Aztec formal orations given by elders for moral instruction, education of youth, and cultural construction of meaning. Between 1553 and 1555 he interviewed indigenous leaders in order to gain their perspective on the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. In 1585 he wrote a revision of the conquest narrative, published as Book 12 of the &quot;Florentine Codex,&quot; one of his last works before his death in 1590.

==Field research==
After the fervor of the early mass conversions in Mexico had subsided, Franciscan missionaries came to realize that they needed a better understanding of indigenous peoples in order effectively to pursue their work. Sahagún&#x27;s life changed dramatically in 1558 when the new provincial of New Spain, Fray Francisco de Toral, commissioned him to write in Nahuatl about topics he considered useful for the missionary project. The provincial wanted Sahagún to formalize his study of native language and culture, so that he could share it with others. The priest had a free hand to conduct his investigations. He conducted research for about twenty-five years, and spent the last fifteen or so editing, translating and copying. His field research activities can be grouped into an earlier period (1558–1561) and a later period (1561–1575).
From his early research, Sahagún wrote the text known as &quot;Primeros Memoriales.&quot; This served as the basis for his subsequent, larger &quot;Historia general&quot;. He conducted his research at Tepeapulco, approximately 50 miles northeast of Mexico City, near present-day Hidalgo. There he spent two years interviewing approximately a dozen village elders in Nahuatl, assisted by native graduates of the college at Tlatelolco. Sahagún questioned the elders about the religious rituals and calendar, family, economic and political customs, and natural history. He interviewed them individually and in groups, and was thus able to evaluate the reliability of the information shared with him. His assistants spoke three languages (Nahuatl, Latin and Spanish). They participated in research and documentation, translation and interpretation, and they also painted illustrations. He published their names, described their work, and gave them credit. The pictures in the &quot;Primeros Memoriales&quot; convey a blend of indigenous and European artistic elements and influences. Analysis of Sahagún&#x27;s research activities in this earlier period indicates that he was developing and evaluating his own methods for gathering and verifying this information.

During the period 1561–1575, Sahagún returned to Tlatelolco. He interviewed and consulted more elders and cultural authorities. He edited his prior work. He expanded the scope of his earlier research, and further developed his interviewing methods. He recast his project along the lines of the medieval encyclopedias. These were not encyclopedias in the contemporary sense, and can be better described as worldbooks, for they attempt to provide a relatively complete presentation of knowledge about the world.

==Methodologies==
Sahagún was among the first to develop methods and strategies for gathering and validating knowledge of indigenous New World cultures. Much later, the scientific discipline of anthropology would formalize the methods of ethnography as a scientific research strategy for documenting the beliefs, behavior, social roles and relationships, and worldview of another culture, and for explaining these factors with reference to the logic of that culture. His research methods and strategies for validating information provided by his informants are precursors of the methods and strategies of modern ethnography.

He systematically gathered knowledge from a range of diverse informants, including women, who were recognized as having knowledge of indigenous culture and tradition. He compared the answers obtained from his various sources. Some passages in his writings appear to be transcriptions of informants&#x27; statements about religious beliefs, society or nature. Other passages clearly reflect a consistent set of questions presented to different informants with the aim of eliciting information on specific topics. Some passages reflect Sahagún&#x27;s own narration of events or commentary.

==Significance==
During the period in which Sahagún conducted his research, the conquering Spaniards were greatly outnumbered by the conquered Aztecs, and were concerned about the threat of a native uprising. Some colonial authorities perceived his writings as potentially dangerous, since they lent credibility to native voices and perspectives. Sahagún was aware of the need to avoid running afoul of the Inquisition, which was established in Mexico in 1570.

Sahagún&#x27;s work was originally conducted only in Nahuatl. To fend off suspicion and criticism, he translated sections of it into Spanish, submitted it to some fellow Franciscans for their review, and sent it to the King of Spain with some Friars returning home. His last years were difficult, because the utopian idealism of the first Franciscans in New Spain was fading while the Spanish colonial project continued as brutal and exploitative. In addition, millions of indigenous people died from repeated epidemics, as they had no immunity to Eurasian diseases. Some of his final writings express feelings of despair. The Crown replaced the religious orders with secular clergy, giving friars a much smaller role in the Catholic life of the colony. Franciscans newly arrived in the colony did not share the earlier Franciscans&#x27; faith and zeal about the capacity of the Indians. The pro-indigenous approach of the Franciscans and Sahagún became marginalized with passing years. The use of the Nahuatl Bible was banned, reflecting the broader global retrenchment of Catholicism under the Council of Trent. In 1575 the Council of the Indies banned all scriptures in the indigenous languages and forced Sahagún to hand over all of his documents about the Aztec culture and the results of his research. The respectful study of the local traditions has probably been seen as a possible obstacle to the Christian mission. Despite this ban, Sahagún made two more copies of his &quot;Historia general&quot;.

Sahagún&#x27;s &quot;Historia general&quot; was unknown outside Spain for about two centuries. In 1793, a bibliographer catalogued the &quot;Florentine Codex&quot; in the Laurentian Library in Florence. The work is now carefully rebound in three volumes. A scholarly community of historians, anthropologists, art historians, and linguists has been investigating Sahagún&#x27;s work, its subtleties and mysteries, for more than 200 years.

The &quot;Historia general&quot; is the product of one of the most remarkable social-science research projects ever conducted. It is not unique as a chronicle of encounters with the New World and its people, but it stands out due to Sahagún&#x27;s effort to gather information about a foreign culture by interviewing people and gathering perspectives from within that culture. As Nicholson has stated, &quot;the scope of the &quot;Historia&#x27;s&quot; coverage of contact-period Central Mexico indigenous culture is remarkable, unmatched by any other sixteenth-century works that attempted to describe the native way of life.&quot; Although in his own mind Sahagún was a Franciscan missionary, he has also been referred to by scholars as the &quot;father of American Ethnography&quot;.

==As a Franciscan Friar==
Sahagún has been described as a missionary, ethnographer, linguist, folklorist, Renaissance humanist, historian and pro-indigenous. Scholars have explained these roles as emerging from his identity as a missionary priest, a participant in the Spanish evangelical fervor for converting newly encountered peoples, and as a part of the broader Franciscan millenarian project.

Founded by Francis of Assisi in the early 13th century, the Franciscan Friars emphasized devotion to the Incarnation, the humanity of Jesus Christ. Saint Francis developed and articulated this devotion based on his experiences of contemplative prayer in front the San Damiano Crucifix and the practice of compassion among lepers and social outcasts. Franciscan prayer includes the conscious remembering of the human life of Jesus and the practice of care for the poor and marginalized.

Saint Francis&#x27; intuitive approach was elaborated into a philosophical vision by subsequent Franciscan theologians, such as Bonaventure of Bagnoregio and John Duns Scotus, leading figures in the Franciscan intellectual tradition. The philosophy of Scotus is founded upon the primacy of the Incarnation, and may have been a particularly important influence on Sahagún, since Scotus&#x27;s philosophy was taught in Spain at this time. Scotus absorbed the intuitive insights of St. Francis of Assisi and his devotion to Jesus Christ as a human being, and expressed them in a broader vision of humanity.

A religious philosophical anthropology — a vision of humanity — may shape a missionary&#x27;s vision of human beings, and in turn the missionary&#x27;s behavior on a cultural frontier. The pro-indigenous approach of the Franciscan missionaries in New Spain is consistent with the philosophy of Franciscan John Duns Scotus. In particular, he outlined a philosophical anthropology that reflects a Franciscan spirit.

Several specific dimensions of Sahagún&#x27;s work (and that of other Franciscans in New Spain) reflect this philosophical anthropology. The native peoples were believed to have dignity and merited respect as human beings. The friars were, for the most part, deeply disturbed by the conquistadores&#x27; abuse of the native peoples. In Sahagún&#x27;s collaborative approach, in which he consistently gave credit to his collaborators, especially Antonio Valeriano, the Franciscan value of community is expressed.

In his five decades of research, he practiced a Franciscan philosophy of knowledge in action. He was not content to speculate about these new peoples, but met with, interviewed and interpreted them and their worldview as an expression of his faith. While others – in Europe and New Spain – were debating whether or not the indigenous peoples were human and had souls, Sahagún was interviewing them, seeking to understand who they were, how they loved each other, what they believed, and how they made sense of the world. Even as he expressed disgust at their continuing practice of human sacrifice and what he perceived as their idolatries, he spent five decades investigating Aztec culture.

==Disillusionment with the &quot;spiritual conquest&quot;==
Learning more about Aztec culture, Sahagún grew increasingly skeptical of the depth of the mass conversions in Mexico. He thought that many if not most of the conversions were superficial. He also became concerned about the tendency of his fellow Franciscan missionaries to misunderstand basic elements of traditional Aztec religious beliefs and cosmology. He became convinced that only by mastering native languages and worldviews could missionaries be effective in dealing with the Aztec people. He began informal studies of indigenous peoples, their beliefs, and religious practices.

In the Florentine Codex, Sahagún wrote numerous introductions, addresses &quot;to the reader&quot;, and interpolations in which he expresses his own views in Spanish. In Book XI, &quot;The Earthly Things,&quot; he replaces a Spanish translation of Nahuatl entries on mountains and rocks to describe current idolatrous practices among the people. &quot;Having discussed the springs, waters, and mountains, this seemed to me to be the opportune place to discuss the principal idolatries which were practiced and are still practiced in the waters and mountains.&quot;

In this section, Sahagún denounces the association of the Virgin of Guadalupe with a pagan Meso-American deity. The Franciscans were then particularly hostile to this cult because of its potential for idolatrous practice, as it conflated the Virgin Mary with an ancient goddess. 
Sahagún explains that a church of Santa Ana has become a pilgrimage site for Toci (Nahuatl: &quot;our grandmother&quot;). He acknowledges that Saint Ann is the mother of the Virgin Mary, and therefore literally the grandmother of Jesus, but Sahagún writes:
But in this same section, Sahagún expressed his profound doubt that the Christian evangelization of the Indians would last in New Spain, particularly since the devastating plague of 1576 decimated the indigenous population and tested the survivors. 
==Sahagún&#x27;s histories of the conquest==
Sahagún wrote two versions of the conquest of the Aztec Empire, the first is Book 12 of the &quot;General History&quot; (1576) and the second is a revision completed in 1585. The version in the &quot;Historia general&quot; is the only narration of historical events, as opposed to information on general topics such as religious beliefs and practices and social structure. The 1576 text is exclusively from an indigenous, largely Tlatelolcan viewpoint. He revised the account in 1585 in important ways, adding passages praising the Spanish, especially the conqueror Hernan Cortés, rather than adhering to the indigenous viewpoint. The original of the 1585 manuscript is lost. In the late 20th century, a handwritten copy in Spanish was found by John B. Glass in the Boston Public Library, and has been published in facsimile and English translation, with comparisons to Book 12 of the General History. In his introduction (&quot;To the reader&quot;) to Book 12 of the &quot;Historia general,&quot; Sahagún claimed the history of the conquest was a linguistic tool so that friars would know the language of warfare and weapons. Since compiling a history of the conquest from the point of view of the defeated Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolcan could be controversial for the Spanish crown, Sahagún may have been prudent in trying to shape how the history was perceived. Sahagún&#x27;s 1585 revision of the conquest narrative, which included praise for Cortés and the Spanish conquest, was completed in a period when work on indigenous texts was under attack. Sahagún likely wrote this version with that political situation well in mind, when a narrative of the conquest entirely from the defeated Mexicans&#x27; viewpoint was suspect.

<doc id="613526" wikidata="Q1543567" url="?curid=613526" title="Grumman G-21 Goose">
<text>The Grumman G-21 Goose is an amphibious flying boat designed by Grumman to serve as an eight-seat &quot;commuter&quot; aircraft for businessmen in the Long Island area. The Goose was Grumman&#x27;s first monoplane to fly, its first twin-engined aircraft, and its first aircraft to enter commercial airline service. During World War II, the Goose became an effective transport for the US military (including the United States Coast Guard), as well as serving with many other air forces. During hostilities, the Goose took on an increasing number of combat and training roles.

==Design and development==
In 1936, a group of wealthy residents of Long Island, including E. Roland Harriman, approached Grumman and commissioned an aircraft that they could use to fly to New York City. In response, the Grumman Model G-21 was designed as a light amphibious transport. Grumman produced a high-wing monoplane of almost all-metal construction—the trailing half of the main wing and all of the flight control surfaces except for the flaps were fabric-covered. It was powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior nine-cylinder, air-cooled, radial engines mounted on the leading edges of the wings. The deep fuselage served also as a hull and was equipped with hand-cranked retractable landing gear. First flight of the prototype took place on May 29, 1937.

The fuselage also proved versatile, as it provided generous interior space that allowed fitting for either a transport or luxury airliner role. Having an amphibious configuration also allowed the G-21 to go just about anywhere, and plans were made to market it as an amphibian airliner.

===Modifications===

A number of modifications were made for the Goose, but the most numerous are those by McKinnon Enterprises of Sandy, Oregon, which holds 21 supplemental type certificates (STCs) for modifying G-21-series aircraft and which also manufactured four different conversions that were recertified under a separate FAA type certificate as brand-new &quot;McKinnon&quot; airplanes. The first was the McKinnon model G-21C which involved replacing the original R-985 radial engines with four Lycoming GSO-480-B2D6 piston engines. It was approved under TC 4A24 on November 7, 1958, and two examples were converted in 1958–1959.

===New production===
In November 2007, Antilles Seaplanes of Gibsonville, North Carolina, announced it was restarting production of the turbine-powered McKinnon G-21G Turbo Goose variant, now identified as the Antilles G-21G Super Goose. Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-34 turboprops flat-rated to would have replaced the original PT6A-27 engines, and the airframe systems and especially the avionics (aviation electronics – i.e. radios and navigation systems) would have been updated with state-of-the-art &quot;glass panel&quot; instrumentation and cockpit displays. However, as of 2009, Antilles Seaplanes&#x27; manufacturing center has been foreclosed and sold at auction. The fate of new Goose production is currently unknown.

==Operational history==
Envisioned as corporate or private flying yachts for Manhattan millionaires, initial production models normally carried two to three passengers and had a bar and small toilet installed. In addition to being marketed to small air carriers, the G-21 was also promoted as a military transport. In 1938, the U.S. Army Air Corps purchased the type as the OA-9 (later, in the war years, examples impressed from civilian ownership were designated the OA-13A). The most numerous of the military versions were the United States Navy variants, designated the JRF.

The amphibious aircraft was also adopted by the Coast Guard and, during World War II, served with the Royal Canadian Air Force in the transport, reconnaissance, rescue, and training roles. The G-21 was used for air-sea rescue duties by the Fleet Air Arm, who assigned the name Goose. A single aircraft was used briefly by No. 1 Air Ambulance Unit, Royal Australian Air Force in the Mediterranean.[21]

After the war, the Goose found continued commercial use in locations from Alaska to Catalina and the Caribbean.

A total of 345 were built, with about 30 known to still be airworthy today (although around 60 are still on various civil registries, many of them are known to have crashed or been otherwise destroyed), most being in private ownership, some of them operating in modified forms.

==Variants==
;G-21
:The original production version, these were powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp Junior SB engines, at gross weight, with six passengers, and 12 were built, all converted to G-21A standards.

:Export coastal patrol flying boat armed with machine gun in bow and dorsal hatches and two bombs underwing, 12 built for Portuguese Naval Aviation.
;G-21C
:Conversion by McKinnon Enterprises, these were re-engined with four Lycoming GSO-480-B2D6 air-cooled, geared, and supercharged flat-six engines and fitted with retractable wingtip floats, a fiberglass radar nose, a one-piece wraparound windshield, and enlarged cabin windows; gross weight increased to as result of internal structural reinforcements. Two were converted as piston-powered models G-21C in 1958–1959, and two other airframes subsequently were converted in 1968, but with two Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-20 turboprops per STC SA1320WE as G-21C Hybrids. Two G-21C Hybrids were identical to the later model G-21E, but they were never certified as such.
;G-21D
:One G-21C was further converted by McKinnon with an extended nose marked by two extra windows on each side and accommodating another four passengers. Recertified as G-21D in 1960. In 1966, it was re-engined with two PT6A-20 turboprops and fitted with revised Alvarez-Calderon electric flaps in accordance with STC SA1320WE, retaining the G-21D designation, but subsequently identified as the McKinnon &quot;Turboprop Goose&quot;.
;G-21E
:A fully certified new model, it was based on a simplified turbine conversion of the McKinnon G-21C, with PT6A-20 engines ( Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-27 engines optional) and more fuel, but without all of the structural reinforcements of the G-21C. gross weight. One converted.

==Accidents and incidents==
;19 November 1943: Grumman JRF-2 of Port Heiden, Alaska (USCG), crashed with three crewmen and one passenger missing. It was found in 1987.
;13 March 1947: A Grumman JRF-6B of Loftleiðir with a pilot and seven passengers crashed immediately after takeoff on Hvammsfjörður by the town of Búðardalur in Iceland. The pilot and four passengers evacuated the plane and were rescued by a boat, but one of those passengers later died. .Three of the original seven passengers died in the crash. 
;21 August 1958: N720 crashed in the Brooks Range, near the upper Ivishak River, in Alaska, killing U.S. Fish and Wildlife Agents Clarence J. Rhode and Stanley Fredericksen, and Clarence&#x27;s son Jack. The crash site was not found until August 23, 1979.
;27 January 1961: A JRF-5 of the French Navy crashed, killing Admiral Pierre Ponchardier and five others. This accident led the French Navy to retire all of their Grumman JRF-5 Gooses in the spring of 1961.
;30 July 1971: One person was killed and one was injured when a Grumman G-21A taking off from the airport in Greenville, Maine experienced engine malfunction during takeoff. The NTSB determined the probable cause to be the pilot&#x27;s lack of familiarity with the plane and fuel mismanagement.
;22 June 1972
: N1513V of Reeve Aleutian Airways was written off at False Pass, Alaska.
;25 August 1978: All 11 people aboard a Webber Airlines seaplane were killed when the Grumman Goose crashed on as it was preparing to land at Labouchere Bay on Prince of Wales Island after a flight from Ketchikan, Alaska.
;2 September 1978: Charles F. Blair Jr., former Naval Air Transport Service and Pan American Airways pilot and husband to actress Maureen O&#x27;Hara, was flying a Grumman Goose that belonged to his company, Antilles Air Boats, from St. Croix to St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands when it crashed into the ocean due to failure of the left engine. He and three passengers were killed; seven passengers were severely injured.
;24 July 1984: Grumman Goose G-21A, Serial # B-114, Registration: N 2021 A, Hal’s Air Service, Piloted by Hal Dierich, Four Fatalities including pilot. Collision with water in the narrow strait NW of Monashka Bay near Ouzinkie, Kodiak Island, AK. 
;15 February 2005: A 1939 Grumman Goose G-21A, registered N-327, crashed around 9:30 am in a field on Route 14A near Penn Yan, New York after an engine failure simulation went wrong.

<text>Pilot Speed (formerly known as Pilate) was a Canadian rock band, who were active in the early 2000s. 

Based in Toronto, Ontario, the band consisted of vocalist and pianist Todd Clark, guitarist Chris Greenough, bassist Ruby Bumrah and drummer Bill Keeley. Clark was a graduate of the music program at the University of Western Ontario, while all of the other three members were alumni of OCAD University.
==History==
The band released their debut EP, &quot;For All That&#x27;s Given, Wasted&quot;, independently in 2001 before signing to MapleMusic Recordings, which released their full-length debut album &quot;Caught by the Window&quot; in 2003. The album was most noted for the single &quot;Into Your Hideout&quot;, which peaked at #3 on Canada&#x27;s rock radio chart. The song&#x27;s music video, directed by Maxime Giroux, won the MuchMusic Video Award for Best Independent Video at the 2004 MuchMusic Video Awards, and was a Juno Award nominee for Video of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2004.

The band followed up in 2006 with the album &quot;Sell Control for Life&#x27;s Speed&quot;. Just a few weeks after the album&#x27;s Canadian release, the band opted to change their name to Pilot Speed after securing an American deal with Wind-up Records, due to the risk of being sued by other American bands named Pilate; they had briefly considered keeping the name Pilate in Canada while using a different name only in the United States, but ruled that option out. The album was released in the United States under the title &quot;Into the West&quot;.

The band&#x27;s third and final album, &quot;Wooden Bones&quot;, was released in 2009.

<text>Shivaji Rao Gaikwad (born 12 December 1950), known professionally as Rajinikanth, is an Indian actor who predominantly works in Tamil cinema. In a career spanning over five decades, he has done 170 films that includes films in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali, and Malayalam. He is widely regarded to be one of the most successful and popular actors in the history of Indian cinema. Known for his uniquely styled mannerism and one liners in films, he has a huge fan base and a cult following. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2016, India&#x27;s third and second highest civilian honours respectively, and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2019, the highest Indian award in the field of cinema, for his contributions to Indian cinema. He has won numerous film awards including seven Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, a Nandi Award, one Filmfare Award and two Maharashtra State Film Awards.

Following his debut in K. Balachander&#x27;s 1975 Tamil drama &quot;Apoorva Raagangal&quot;, Rajinikanth&#x27;s acting career commenced with a brief phase of portraying antagonistic characters in Tamil films. His major positive role as a scorned lover in S. P. Muthuraman&#x27;s &quot;Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri&quot; (1977), 1978&#x27;s &quot;Mullum Malarum&quot; and &quot;Aval Appadithan&quot; received him critical acclaim; the former earned him a Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for Best Actor. By the end of the decade, he had worked in all South Indian film industries and established a career in Tamil cinema. He then played dual roles in the action thriller &quot;Billa&quot; (1980), a remake of the Hindi film &quot;Don&quot; (1978). It was his biggest commercial success to that point, earned him stardom and gave him the action hero image. He starred in triple role in &quot;Moondru Mugam&quot; (1982), which earned him a special prize at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards ceremony. The following year, he made his Hindi film debut with T. Rama Rao&#x27;s top grossing &quot;Andhaa Kaanoon&quot; (1983). &quot;Nallavanukku Nallavan&quot; (1984) won him that year&#x27;s Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actor. In the latter half of the 1980s, he starred in several successful films in Tamil and Hindi, including &quot;Geraftaar&quot; (1985), &quot;Padikkadavan&quot; (1985), &quot;Mr. Bharath&quot; (1986), &quot;Dosti Dushmani&quot; (1986), &quot;Velaikaran&quot; (1987), &quot;Manithan&quot; (1987), &quot;Dharmathin Thalaivan&quot; (1988) and &quot;ChaalBaaz&quot; (1989).

In 1991, Mani Ratnam&#x27;s Tamil crime film &quot;Thalapathi&quot;, earned him major critical acclaim for his performance. He collaborated with Suresh Krissna for many films including &quot;Annaamalai&quot; (1992) and &quot;Baashha&quot; (1995); the latter was the biggest commercial success in his career yet as well as the highest-grossing film in Tamil for many years. His other success includes P. Vasu&#x27;s &quot;Mannan&quot; (1992), &quot;Uzhaippali&quot; (1993) and K. S. Ravikumar&#x27;s &quot;Muthu&quot; (1995) and &quot;Padayappa&quot; (1999); the latter which went on to become his and Tamil cinema&#x27;s highest-grossing movie, exceeding &quot;Baashha&quot;.

After a few years of hiatus, he returned to acting with the comedy horror film &quot;Chandramukhi&quot; (2005); it went on to become again the highest-grossing Tamil film. His next, S. Shankar&#x27;s &quot;Sivaji&quot; (2007) was the third Indian film and the first ever Tamil film to enter the 100 Crore Club. He then played dual role as a scientist and an andro-humanoid robot in the science fiction film &quot;Enthiran&quot; (2010) and its sequel &quot;2.0&quot; (2018), both being India&#x27;s most expensive productions at the time of their release and among the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. In 2023, his most recent blockbuster &quot;Jailer&quot;, made a significant impact in the Tamil film industry, earning over 600 crore and establishing him as the sole actor with two 500 crore grosser films in the industry.

Rajinikanth was also named one of the most influential persons in South Asia by &quot;Asiaweek&quot;. He was also named by &quot;Forbes India&quot; as the most influential Indian of the year 2010.

In 2024, Rajinikanth received UAE Golden Visa.

==Early life and background==

Rajinikanth was born as Shivaji Rao Gaikwad on 12 December 1950 in a Marathi family in Bangalore, Mysore State (present day Karnataka). His mother was a homemaker, and his father Ramoji Rao Gaekwad was a police constable. His ancestors hailed from Mavadi Kadepathar, Pune district, Maharashtra. He is the youngest of four siblings in a family consisting of two elder brothers (Satyanarayana Rao and Nageshwara Rao) and a sister (Aswath Balubhai). After his father&#x27;s retirement from work in 1956, the family moved to the suburb of Hanumantha Nagar in Bangalore and built a house there. He lost his mother at the age of nine.

Rajinikanth had his primary education at the Gavipuram Government Kannada Model Primary School in Bangalore. As a child, he was &quot;studious and mischievous&quot; with a great interest in cricket, football and basketball. During this time, his brother enrolled him at the Ramakrishna Math, a Hindu monastery set up by the Ramakrishna Mission. In the &quot;math&quot;, he was taught Vedas, tradition and history, which eventually instilled a sense of spirituality in him. In addition to spiritual lessons, he also began acting in plays at the &quot;math&quot;. His aspiration towards theatre grew at the math and was once given an opportunity to enact the role of &quot;Ekalavya&quot;&#x27;s friend from the Hindu epic Mahabharata. His performance in the play received praise from the Kannada poet D. R. Bendre. After sixth grade, Rajinikanth was enrolled at the Acharya Pathasala Public School and studied there till completion of his pre-university course. During his schooling at the &quot;Acharya Pathasala&quot;, he spent a lot of time acting in plays.

Upon completion of his school education, Rajinikanth performed several jobs including that of a coolie, before getting a job in the Bangalore Transport Service as a bus conductor. He continued to take part in plays after the Kannada playwright Topi Muniappa offered him a chance to act in one of his mythological plays. He decided to take up an acting course in the newly formed Madras Film Institute after coming across an advertisement. Although his family was not fully supportive of his decision to join the institute, his friend and co-worker Raj Bahadur motivated him to join the institute and financially supported him during this phase. During his stay at the institute, he was noticed by the Tamil film director K. Balachander. Balachander provided Rajinikanth with his stage name to avoid confusion with fellow actor Sivaji Ganesan, having taken it from a character&#x27;s name in his earlier film &quot;Major Chandrakanth&quot;. The director advised him to learn to speak Tamil, a recommendation that Rajinikanth quickly followed. Although he can read the language, he cannot write in it.

==Acting career==

=== 1974–1977: Early career ===
Rajinikanth began his film career with the Tamil film &quot;Apoorva Raagangal&quot; (1975), directed by K. Balachander. He was cast in a small role as the ex-husband of the female lead played by Srividya. The film explored relationships between people with wide age differences and was deemed controversial upon release. However, it received critical acclaim and won three National Film Awards including the Award for the Best Tamil Feature at the 23rd National Film Awards in 1976. A review from &quot;The Hindu&quot; noted that, &quot;Newcomer Rajinikanth is dignified and impressive.&quot; His next release was Puttanna Kanagal&#x27;s Kannada anthology film &quot;Katha Sangama&quot; (1976). Rajinikanth appeared in the last segment of the film; he played the role as a village ruffian who rapes a blind woman in the absence of her husband. Balachander cast him in a pivotal role in &quot;Anthuleni Katha&quot; (1976), the Telugu remake of his own Tamil film &quot;Aval Oru Thodar Kathai&quot; (1974). In &quot;Moondru Mudichu&quot;the first Tamil film to feature him in a prominent rolehe played a character that &quot;blithely row[s] away&quot; when his friend drowns accidentally in the lake only to fulfill his desire to marry the former&#x27;s girlfriend. His style of flipping the cigarette in the film made him popular among the audience. In his final release of the year, &quot;Baalu Jenu&quot;, he was cast as the main antagonist who troubles the female lead. He played similar roles in Balachander&#x27;s &quot;Avargal&quot; (1977), and Bharathiraja&#x27;s &quot;16 Vayadhinile&quot; (1977). The same year, he made his first-ever appearance as a lead actor in the Telugu film &quot;Chilakamma Cheppindi&quot; (1977), which earned him his only nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. S. P. Muthuraman experimented Rajinikanth in a positive role in &quot;Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri&quot; (1977). The success of the film brought the duo together for 24 more films till the 1990s. Rajinikanth played supporting and &quot;villainous&quot; roles in most of the films released during the year. In &quot;Gaayathri&quot; he was cast as a pornographer who secretly films his relationship with his wife without her knowledge and in &quot;Galate Samsara&quot; he played the role of a married man who develops an affair with a cabaret dancer. He had 15 of his films released during the year.

=== 1978–1989: Experimentation and breakthrough ===
In 1978, Rajinikanth had 20 releases across Tamil, Telugu and Kannada. His first film of the year was P. Madhavan&#x27;s &quot;Shankar Salim Simon&quot;, in which he was among the three leads. Following that, he co-starred alongside Vishnuvardhan in the Kannada film &quot;Kiladi Kittu&quot;. He played the second lead in &quot;Annadammula Savaal&quot;, which starred Krishna; Rajinikanth reprised his role from the Kannada original. He then played an important role in the supernatural thriller &quot;Aayiram Jenmangal&quot;. In &quot;Maathu Tappada Maga&quot;, he was the main antagonist. &quot;Bairavi&quot;, directed by M. Bhaskar, was the first Tamil film to cast Rajinikanth as a solo hero. It was for this film that he earned the sobriquet &quot;Superstar&quot;. S. Thanu, one of the film&#x27;s distributors, set up a high cut-out of Rajinikanth. His next appearance &quot;Ilamai Oonjal Aadukirathu&quot;, a quadrangular love story written and directed by C. V. Sridhar, saw him play the role of a man who sacrifices his love for his friend, played by Kamal Haasan. The film&#x27;s success prompted Sridhar to remake the film in Telugu, &quot;Vayasu Pilichindi&quot;, which retained the original cast of the Tamil film.

His next film, &quot;Vanakkatukuriya Kathaliye&quot;, had an introductory song to mark his entry, a trend that would soon catch on in with his later films. &quot;Mullum Malarum&quot;, released during the same period, received critical acclaim, and earned him his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil nomination. The film marked the directional debut of Mahendran, with a screenplay adapted from a novel of the same name published in &quot;Kalki&quot;. It won the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Film and a Special Prize (Best Actor) for Rajinikanth at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. Following this, he made a foray into Malayalam cinema with I. V. Sasi&#x27;s fantasy film &quot;Allauddinum Albhutha Vilakkum&quot;, which was based on a story from the Arabian Nights. The same year, he acted in &quot;Dharma Yuddam&quot;, in which he played a mentally-ill person avenging the death of his parents. He then co-starred with N. T. Rama Rao in &quot;Tiger&quot;. Upon completion of &quot;Tiger&quot;, Rajinikanth had acted in 50 films over a period of four years, and in four languages. Some other popular films released during this period are the youthful entertainer &quot;Ninaithale Inikkum&quot;, the Tamil–Kannada bilingual &quot;Priya&quot;, the Telugu film &quot;Amma Evarikkaina Amma&quot; and the melodrama &quot;Aarilirunthu Arubathu Varai&quot;. &quot;Priya&quot;, based on a detective novel by Sujatha, had the distinction of being the first film of Rajinikanth to be shot mostly outside India, mainly in Southeast Asia. A&quot;arilirunthu Arubathu Varai&quot; earned him his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil.

Raijinikanth, who credited Hindi film star Amitabh Bachchan as his inspiration, began playing Amitabh Bachchan&#x27;s roles in Tamil remakes of his films. This began with &quot;Shankar Salim Simon&quot; (1978), a remake of &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; (1977), followed by &quot;Naan Vazhavaippen&quot; (1979), a remake of &quot;Majboor&quot; (1974). He was subsequently cast in a series of roles modelled after Amitabh Bachchan in Tamil remakes of his films. Rajinikanth starred in eleven Tamil remakes of Amitabh Bachchan films, as well as a Telugu remake of &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot;, &quot;Ram Robert Rahim&quot; (1980), alongside Sridevi. The most successful of these were remakes of Salim–Javed films, such as &quot;Billa&quot; (1980), &quot;Thee&quot; (1981) and &quot;Mr. Bharath&quot; (1986).

During this phase of his career, Rajinikanth abruptly chose to quit acting, but was coaxed to return with the Tamil film &quot;Billa&quot; (1980), a remake of the Bollywood blockbuster &quot;Don&quot; (1978), written by Salim-Javed and starring Amitabh Bachchan. &quot;Billa&quot; had Rajinikanth playing dual roles and eventually became his first solo commercial success. His pairing with Sridevi continued in &quot;Johnny&quot;, where he was once again cast in a double role, earned him his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. He also starred in &quot;Murattu Kaalai&quot; which was a commercial success. The success of &quot;Billa&quot; was a turning point in Rajinikanth&#x27;s career, disproving detractors that claimed Rajnikanth was &quot;finished&quot; and which saw him accepted as a full-fledged hero. The success of &quot;Billa&quot; established Rajinikanth as one of the top stars of Tamil cinema.

In 1981, he appeared in &quot;Garjanai&quot; which was shot simultaneously in Kannada and Malayalam, making it his last film in those two languages up until 2023. In K. Balachander&#x27;s first home production, &quot;Netrikan&quot;, he played dual roles as a womanising father and a responsible son. His first full-length comedy was &quot;Thillu Mullu&quot;, directed by K. Balachander. He agreed to it solely due to the strong suggestion by his mentor that he should do non-commercial roles, to break the stereotyped action-hero mould by which he was getting famous at the time. &quot;Thillu Mullu&quot; earned him his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. 1981 also saw the release of &quot;Thee&quot;, a remake of blockbuster Hindi film &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975), also originally written by Salim-Javed and starring Amitabh Bachchan; in &quot;Thee&quot;, Rajinikanth reprised the role of Bachchan. In 1982, he starred in &quot;Pokkiri Raja&quot;, &quot;Moondru Mugam&quot;, &quot;Thanikattu Raja&quot;, &quot;Puthukavithai&quot; and &quot;Enkeyo Ketta Kural&quot;. &quot;Moondru Mugam&quot; which starred Rajinikanth playing three different roles for the first time, earned him his fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil.

By 1983, he was a popular actor across South Indian cinema, including Telugu and Kannada films. In 1983, he starred in his first Bollywood film, &quot;Andhaa Kaanoon&quot;, alongside Hema Malini, Reena Roy and Amitabh Bachchan (in an extended cameo appearance). The film opened to excellent response from the audience and emerged a blockbuster at the box office. In 1984, he appeared in &quot;Naan Mahaan Alla&quot;, a remake of Subhash Ghai&#x27;s directional &quot;Vishwanath&quot;, the film proved to be a superhit. That same year, he played a small role in &quot;Anbulla Rajinikanth&quot; and delivered three more successful Hindi films, &quot;Meri Adalat&quot;, &quot;Gangvaa&quot; and &quot;John Jani Janardhan&quot; (in which he played a triple role). His performance in &quot;Nallavanuku Nallavan&quot; earned him his first and only Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. In his 100th film &quot;Sri Raghavendra&quot; (1985), he played the Hindu saint Raghavendra Swami.

In the second half of the 1980s, Rajinikanth acted in commercially successful films, such as &quot;Naan Sigappu Manithan&quot; (1985), &quot;Geraftaar&quot; (1985), &quot;Padikkathavan&quot; (1985), &quot;Mr. Bharath&quot; (1986), &quot;Dosti Dushmani&quot; (1986), &quot;Velaikaran&quot; (1987), &quot;Manithan&quot; (1987), &quot;Insaaf Kaun Karega&quot; (1987), &quot;Guru Sishyan&quot; (1988) and &quot;Dharmathin Thalaivan&quot; (1988), with &quot;Velaikaran&quot; earning him his seventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. In 1988, he made his only American film appearance in &quot;Bloodstone&quot;, directed by Dwight Little, in which he played an English-speaking Indian taxi driver. Rajinikanth finished the decade with films including &quot;Rajadhi Raja&quot;, &quot;Siva&quot;, &quot;Raja Chinna Roja&quot; and &quot;Mappillai&quot; while also starring in a few Bollywood productions. &quot;Raja Chinna Roja&quot; was the first Indian film to feature live action and animation.

=== 1990–2010: Superstardom ===
Rajinikanth began the new decade with a mega blockbuster in &quot;Panakkaran&quot; (1990), which was a remake of Amitabh Bachchan&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Laawaris&quot;. The film earned him his eighth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. His next two Tamil films, the fantasy comedy &quot;Athisaya Piravi&quot;, (a remake of Chiranjeevi&#x27;s 1988 film &quot;Yamudiki Mogudu&quot;) which also released in 1990 and the family drama &quot;Dharmadorai&quot; (1991), did above-average business at the box office. His stint with Bollywood continued since the past decade as he went on to star in more Hindi films. &quot;Hum&quot; released in 1991 saw him doing the second main lead with Amitabh Bachchan became an inspiration for &quot;Baashha&quot;. In 1991, he worked with Mani Ratnam in &quot;Thalapathi&quot;, which was heavily inspired by the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. in which he co-starred with actor Mammooty; the film dealt with the friendship between two unknown characters based on Karna and Duryodhana, respectively, and was set in a more contemporary milieu and was both critically acclaimed and successful upon release. He received his ninth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil for the film. He went on to appear in remakes of films from other languages, mostly from Hindi and Telugu. &quot;Annamalai&quot;, which released in 1992, was yet another friendship-centric film and was loosely based on the 1987 Bollywood film &quot;Khudgarz&quot;. The film was the first to have the &quot;Superstar&quot; graphic title card. He received his tenth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil for the film. &quot;Mannan&quot;, directed by P. Vasu, a remake of Kannada actor Rajkumar&#x27;s 1986 blockbuster &quot;Anuraga Aralithu&quot;, also was released in 1992 and became a box office success. Rajinikanth wrote his first screenplay for the film &quot;Valli&quot; (1993), in which he also made a special appearance. He also starred in the film &quot;Yajaman&quot;, in which he played the role of Vaanavaraayan, a village chieftain. His romantic-comedy &quot;Veera&quot; (1994) was controversial for its climax but went on to become one of the highest-grossing films in 1994. That year, he earned his eleventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil for the action-drama &quot;Uzhaippali&quot;.

He joined hands with Suresh Krishna for &quot;Baashha&quot; (1995), which emerged as an industry record, and is routinely touted by fans and critics alike as a major-hit, as the film elevated him from being just another very popular actor to nearly demigod status among the masses. He made a cameo in &quot;Peddarayudu&quot; for his friend Mohan Babu and also helped him in obtaining the remake rights. The same year, he acted in yet another gangster film, &quot;Aatank Hi Aatank&quot; with Aamir Khan which was also his last Hindi film in a major role till date. His film &quot;Muthu&quot;, a remake of Mohanlal&#x27;s blockbuster Malayalam film &quot;Thenmavin Kombathu&quot;, was another commercial success, directed by K. S. Ravikumar and produced by K. Balachander, and became the first Tamil film to be dubbed into Japanese, as &quot;Mutu: Odoru Maharaja&quot;. The film grossed a record US$1.6 million in Japan in 1998 and was responsible for creating a large Japanese fan-base for the actor. &quot;Muthu&quot;″s success in Japan led American news magazine &quot;Newsweek&quot; to comment in a 1999 article that Rajinikanth had &quot;supplanted Leonardo DiCaprio as Japan&#x27;s trendiest heartthrob&quot;. During a visit to Japan in 2006, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh acknowledged the success of &quot;Muthu&quot; in the country during a speech, justifying the positive relationship between the two nations. He received his twelfth and thirteenth nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil for his performances in &quot;Baashha&quot; and &quot;Muthu&quot;.

He also entered Bengali cinema through &quot;Bhagya Debata&quot;, which was released at the end of 1995. 1997&#x27;s &quot;Arunachalam&quot;, another commercial success, earned him his fourteenth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. Rajinikanth released his last film of the millennium with &quot;Padayappa&quot; (1999), which went on to become a blockbuster success, and earned him his fifteenth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. It starred Ramya Krishnan and Soundarya, the former critically acclaimed for her performance. It was also the last prominent role for veteran Tamil actor Sivaji Ganesan.

After a brief pause, Rajinikanth starred in &quot;Baba&quot; in 2002, for which he had also written the screenplay. Released with much fanfare and hype at the time, the film featured a story revolving around the reforming of a gangster, later revealed to be the reincarnation of the Hindu saint Mahavatar Babaji, and fights against political corruption. It fell short of market expectations and the high bids reportedly translated to heavy losses for the distributors. Rajinikanth himself repaid the losses incurred by the distributors. The film was received with comments such as &quot;the bloom was off the rose&quot; and that &quot;the gold does not glitter any more&quot;. Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) leader S. Ramadoss condemned him for smoking and posing with beedis in the film. He was criticised for spoiling the Tamil youth by glorifying smoking and drinking. PMK volunteers attacked the theatres which screened the film and usurped film rolls and burned them.

Two years later, Rajinikanth signed up for P. Vasu&#x27;s &quot;Chandramukhi&quot; (2005), a remake of the Malayalam film &quot;Manichitrathazhu&quot;. Upon release the film was highly successful at the box office, and in 2007 it set the record of being the longest running Tamil film. &quot;Chandramukhi&quot; was also dubbed in Turkish and in German as &quot;Der Geisterjäger&quot; and released in the respective nations. Following &quot;Chandramukhi&quot;″s release, it was reported that AVM Productions was set to produce a film directed by Shankar starring Rajinikanth – the largest collaboration yet for a Tamil film. The film was titled &quot;Sivaji&quot; and was released in the summer of 2007, following two years of filming and production. It became the first Tamil film to be charted as one of the &quot;top-ten best films&quot; of the United Kingdom and South Africa box offices upon release. Rajinikanth received a salary of , for his role in the film highest in his film career at that time. He received his sixteenth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil for his performance in the film. During the production of &quot;Sivaji&quot;, Soundarya Rajinikanth announced her intention of producing a computer-generated imagery film starring an animated version of her father titled &quot;Sultan: The Warrior&quot;. The film was set for release in 2008, however, it entered development hell, and its development status would become unknown over the next few years.
He worked with P. Vasu again for &quot;Kuselan&quot;, a remake of the Malayalam film &quot;Kadha Parayumbol&quot;, which was made simultaneously in Telugu as &quot;Kathanayakudu&quot;, in which Rajinikanth played an extended cameo role as Ashok Kumar, a film star in the Indian cinema, and as a best friend to the film&#x27;s protagonist. According to Rajinikanth, the film somewhat narrated his early life. The film, however, performed poorly at box offices and led to many distributors incurring major losses. Rajinikanth also stated that he would work with Pyramid Saimira again to compensate for &quot;Kuselan&quot;.

Rajinikanth worked again with Shankar for the science fiction film &quot;Enthiran&quot;. The film was released worldwide in 2010 as the most expensive Indian film ever made, ultimately emerging an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot; and the second highest-grossing film in India of its time. Rajinikanth was paid a remuneration of for the film. He received his seventeenth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil for his performance in the film. The film&#x27;s success lead to the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad to use the film as a case study to analyse the business of cinema and its success story in a post-graduate elective management course called &quot;Contemporary Film Industry: A Business Perspective&quot;. The course would also study &quot;Muthu&quot;.

=== 2011-present: Career fluctuations and return to success ===

In January 2011, Rajinikanth was slated to appear in &quot;Rana&quot;, a period film to be produced by Soundarya Rajinikanth and directed by K. S. Ravikumar, who would work with the actor for a third time. During the principal photography of the film on 29 April 2011, he suffered a mild foodborne illness on the sets, which led to vomiting, dehydration, and exhaustion. He was treated at St. Isabel&#x27;s Hospital for a day before being discharged. Five days later, he was rushed to the same hospital again after suffering from breathlessness and fever. He was diagnosed with bronchitis and was kept at the hospital for a week, while also spending a few days in an intensive care unit. Several conflicting reports of discharge dates arose, as well as claims of Rajinikanth&#x27;s health deteriorating. Two days after his last discharge, Rajinikanth was admitted to the Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute on 16 May 2011 for recurring respiratory and gastrointestinal problems. The hospital maintained that Rajinikanth was in stable condition and showed positive response to treatment. It was widely reported that he required a kidney transplantation, which was later denied by Dhanush.

On 21 May 2011, Aishwarya Rajinikanth released a photo of her and Rajinikanth in his hospital ward, both posing with a thumbs-up, responding to fans&#x27; negative reaction to news reports. The hospital restricted unauthorised visitors. Rajinikanth&#x27;s brother, Sathyanarayana Rao Gaekwad, reported that the cause of the sudden illness was due to stress from rapid weight-loss and changes in diet, as well as withdrawal of alcohol consumption and smoking cessation. After addressing fans in a 4-minute digitally recorded voice message to the media, Rajinikanth, under the advice of Amitabh Bachchan, travelled from Chennai to Singapore with his family on 21 May 2011, where he was to undergo further treatment for nephropathy at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. After spending over two weeks at the hospital, he was finally discharged on 15 June 2011 and continued to recuperate in Singapore, before returning to Chennai on 13 July 2011. 
Despite several failed attempts to restart &quot;Rana&quot; upon his return, Rajinikanth reprised his &quot;Enthiran&quot; character, Chitti, in the Bollywood science-fiction film &quot;Ra.One&quot; (2011) in a guest appearance alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor. In November 2011, it was decided that &quot;Rana&quot; would be shelved in favour of a new project, titled &quot;Kochadaiiyaan&quot;. The film became a huge disaster at the box office. The motion capture film, which is the first of its type in India, was released in 2014 to positive reviews. &quot;Kochadaiiyaan&quot;, and the 3D release of &quot;Sivaji&quot; in 2012, made Rajinikanth the first Indian actor to have appeared in four different forms of world cinema: black-and-white, colour, 3D and motion capture. Following the completion of &quot;Kochadaiiyaan&quot;, Rajinikanth began work in Ravikumar&#x27;s next directorial venture, titled &quot;Lingaa.&quot; The film was released on 12 December 2014, coinciding with his birthday, and received mixed reviews from critics.

After a two-year absence from big screen, Rajinikanth&#x27;s next film was director Pa. Ranjith&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Kabali&quot;, produced by S. Thanu. The film was released in July 2016. The film became the highest grossing Tamil film of the year grossing over and became the fifth highest-grossing Tamil film of all time before being surpassed by his another film &quot;2.0&quot;. Also, at the Ananda Vikatan Cinema Awards, the film was nominated at five categories winning all of them, and also won five awards, at the Edison Awards, and two nominations at the 6th South Indian International Movie Awards. He also received his eighteenth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil for his performance in the film.

In August 2016, it was announced that Rajinikanth and director Ranjith would work together again for a film with Dhanush as producer, titled &quot;Kaala&quot;, in which Rajinikanth plays a Dharavi-dwelling gangster who fights against corporate takeover of the slum. The film was officially released on 7 June 2018 and received positive reviews from critics. In 2018 he also appeared in S. Shankar&#x27;s &quot;2.0&quot; reprising the roles of Dr. Vaseegaran and Chitti, alongside Akshay Kumar and Amy Jackson. The film was released on 29 November 2018 and was commercially successful at the box office. The film earned over worldwide on its first day, which was the second-highest ever for an Indian film. The film crossed in its opening weekend to be the highest-grossing film worldwide for that week. The film also grossed over at the box office became the highest-grossing Tamil film of the year and second highest grossing Tamil film of all time. &quot;2.0&quot; is the fourth highest-grossing film in India and is the seventh highest-grossing Indian film worldwide. In 2019, Rajinikanth starred in Karthik Subbaraj&#x27;s &quot;Petta&quot;, in which his performance received praise for his return to his vintage stereotypical style of acting and grossed over , becoming the second highest-grossing Tamil film of 2019. The combined gross earnings of &quot;Kaala&quot;, &quot;2.0&quot; and &quot;Petta&quot; by the end of January 2019 was determined to be over 1000 crore according to trade analysts. Rajinikanth then worked with AR Murugadoss in the film &quot;Darbar&quot;, alongside Nayanthara which released in 2020. He played the role of a police officer after 27 years since his last film as a police officer was the Tamil film &quot;Pandian&quot;. In spite of the huge expectations, the film received mixed to negative reviews and flopped at the box office. His 168th film was with director Siva, titled &quot;Annaatthe&quot; co-starring Nayanthara and Keerthy Suresh. The film was released on 4 November 2021. The film became a commercial success at the box office by grossing around beating the collections made by other Tamil films such as &quot;Master&quot; and &quot;Maanaadu&quot;.

After a two-year absence from big screen, his 169th film is &quot;Jailer&quot;, which was directed by Nelson Dilipkumar. He played a retired jailer in the film and it was released on 10 August 2023. The film received predominantly positive reviews upon its release and achieved tremendous commercial success, grossing over 600 crores worldwide. In 2024, he appeared in T. J. Gnanavel&#x27;s action drama film &quot;Vettaiyan&quot; and did a guest appearance in his daughter&#x27;s (Aishwarya Rajinikanth) sports drama film &quot;Lal Salaam&quot;. While the latter sank without a trace, &quot;Vettaiyan&quot; opened to positive critical reception, but underperformed commercially.

==== Upcoming projects ====

Sun Pictures officially announced his 171st film with Lokesh Kanagaraj as the director, confirming the rumors of his collaboration with Rajinikanth. On 22 April 2024, the title of the project was revealed as &quot;Coolie&quot; with the teaser release. In October 2023, Lokesh Kanagaraj disclosed that the principal photography of the film is scheduled to begin in March 2024. However, due to a series of delays, filming only began in July 2024. Release is planned for mid-2025.

==Political career==

It was speculated that Rajinikanth would enter politics in 1995. He decided against it and declared that if he entered politics now, it would result in a lot of confusion and that he would not be able to serve the people and fulfil their expectations. However, he added that if Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa&#x27;s party returns to power in the 1996 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, &quot;even God cannot save the people of the State&quot;. Rajinikanth went on to wholeheartedly support the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and Tamil Maanila Congress alliance and asked the people of Tamil Nadu and his fans to vote for that alliance. This alliance had a complete victory in the elections. He also supported the same alliance in the 1996 and 1998 Indian general elections.

Later in 2004, Rajinikanth said he would personally vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but would not extend his support to any front during the upcoming Indian general election. The party, however, failed to win any seats in Tamil Nadu in the Lok Sabha.

Rajinikanth canceled his visit to Sri Lanka in March 2017 at the urging of Tamil Nadu politicians. Leaders of the BJP criticized this choice. In June 2017, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy alleged that Rajinikanth was illiterate and unfit for politics. He also accused Rajinikanth of financial fraud, claiming that he has strong proof of financial irregularities by Rajinikanth that will bring down Rajinikanth&#x27;s political aspirations.

However several political analysts state Rajinikanth has missed his chance and unlike 1996 when he was at his peak it will be very difficult for him to make a significant impact in 2019.

Rajinikanth announced entry into politics on 31 December 2017 and confirmed his intention to contest in the 2021 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly elections in all 234 constituencies. He stated that his party would resign if it was unable to fulfill its electoral promises within three years of coming into power. Rajinikanth dissolved his organisation Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) on 12 July 2021 and also said that he has no plans to enter politics in the future.

== Public image ==

Rajinikanth is widely regarded as one of the most popular actors in the history of Indian cinema. His popularity has been attributed to his distinctively delivered dialogue and eccentricities showcased in his movies, alongside his political pronouncements and charitable work. Many also cite reasons for Rajinikanth&#x27;s popularity as coming from his larger-than-life super-hero appearance in many films, supported by gravity-defying stunts and charismatic expressions, all while attempting to maintain modesty in real-life. Almost every film of Rajinikanth has punchlines delivered by him in a distinctive style, and these punchlines often have a message or even warn the film&#x27;s antagonists.

Rajinikanth is one of the highest-grossing actors in Tamil cinema history. After opening his first official Twitter account in 2014, Rajinikanth received over 210,000 followers within 24 hours, which according to &quot;The Economic Times&quot; was deemed by social media research firms as the fastest rate of followers for any Indian celebrity, as well as among the top-10 in the world. In 2015, a film about his fandom, &quot;For the Love of a Man&quot;, premiered at the 71st Venice International Film Festival.

==Personal life==

===Relationships===
While he was working as a bus conductor in Bangalore, Rajinikanth met a medical student named Nirmala and started a relationship. After seeing him perform in a stage play, she encouraged him to pursue an acting career and sent an application to the Adyar Film Institute on his behalf and unbeknownst to him. Although he took up the offer and proceeded with his acting career, Rajinikanth has since lost contact with her.

===Family===
Rajinikanth married Latha Rangachari, a student of Ethiraj College for Women who interviewed him for her college magazine. The marriage took place on 26 February 1981, in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh. The couple has two daughters: Aishwarya and Soundarya. He has four grandchildren through his daughters.

===Views===
Rajinikanth is a practicing Hindu and is a strong believer of spirituality. He is also a practitioner of yoga and meditation. Rajinikanth has religiously visited major Hindu temples prior to the release of each of his films; for instance he visited the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple before the release of &quot;Sivaji&quot; in 2007 and visited Sathya Sai Baba at Prasanthi Nilayam in Andhra Pradesh before the release of &quot;Kuselan&quot; the following year. He also occasionally leaves for pilgrimage to the Himalayas.

He has often referred to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Swami Satchidananda, Ragavendra Swami, Mahavatar Babaji, and Ramana Maharshi as his favourite spiritual leaders.

===Philanthropy===
According to Naman Ramachandran, the author of &quot;&quot;, most of Rajinikanth&#x27;s philanthropic activities went unpublicised because he chose to keep them undisclosed. In the 1980s, when superstitious beliefs in Tamil Nadu created a stigma towards eye donation, Rajinikanth took the case of campaigning in support of corneal transplantation via television and public speeches. In 2011, Rajinikanth announced his support for the anti-corruption movement led by Anna Hazare and offered his commercial wedding venue, the Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam, in Chennai free of cost for the India Against Corruption members to hold their fast. He also provided lodging in the venue for sanitary workers hired to clean up after the 2015 South India floods. Rajinikanth&#x27;s fan associations regularly organise blood donation and eye donation camps and distribute food during his birthday.

== Controversies ==

=== Money lending allegation ===
Rajinikanth declared , and as earnings for the years 2002–2003, 2003–2004 and 2004–2005, respectively. However, the Income Tax Department observed that he had claimed a considerable sum of professional expenses and thus carried out a survey in 2005 at his residence at Poes Garden. During the survey, the IT-Department found out that he had accounted for a lost of costs as his professional costs and it was also discovered that not even one-tenth of the residential property was allocated to professional purposes. Moreover, when Rajinikanth was questioned by the I-T department if he&#x27;s in the money lending business, he initially denied it. Later, though, he admitted to the IT-Department that he was indeed a money lender, and that he had loaned money as a source of profit at an interest rate of 18 percent. Later, for all three years in dispute, Rajinikanth was forced to submit revised reports, confessing he had earned more than what was reported in the initial report on 14 February 2005. But the I-T department penalized him , since he filed revised returns only after they surveyed him.

This was challenged by Rajinikanth and his lawyers, and in January 2020 the I-T department wrote off the fine, due to its recent decision to withdraw from appeals in cases below . The news that Rajinikanth told the Income Tax department that he was lending money at an 18 per cent interest rate has earned outrage and criticism for his high interest rate loans, which is a big problem in Tamil Nadu.

===Comments on social issues===

In 2002, Rajinikanth undertook a day-long fast to protest the Government of Karnataka&#x27;s decision to not release Kaveri River water into Tamil Nadu, and announced that he would contribute toward a plan to interlink Indian rivers. He met with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and many experts to canvass support for the project. His hunger strike was independent of the Nadigar Sangam, who organised their own solidarity protest for the same cause. Film director Bharathi Raja lashed out against Rajinikanth, alleging that he is dividing the film industry and saying that he was a &quot;traitor who had a tacit understanding with the Karnataka government&quot;.

In 2008, Rajinikanth took part in a hunger strike organised by the Nadigar Sangam against Karnataka&#x27;s stance on the Hogenakkal Falls water dispute, during which he gave a speech against politicians in Karnataka. It led to the state announcing a ban on him and his film &quot;Kuselan&quot; (2008). The ban was lifted after Rajinikanth appeared on TV9 Kannada and issued an apology for his speech. He later thanked the Government of Karnataka for lifting the ban and allowing the film&#x27;s release in the state. The apology and subsequent gratitude towards Karnataka led to strong reactions from Nadigar Sangam members R. Sarathkumar, Sathyaraj and Radha Ravi, who called the apology a disgrace to Tamils and opined that his speech never provoked the sentiments of the Kannada people. Rajinikanth&#x27;s support toward fellow actor Ajith Kumar, who in 2010 condemned the forceful inclusion of Tamil cinema personae in political affairs, broke into a controversy.

In 2020, Rajinikanth quoted a 2017 article from &quot;Outlook&quot;, which reported that Dravidar Kazhagam founder Periyar E. V. Ramasamy garlanded the idols of Hindu deities Rama and Sita with footwear at an atheist rally in 1971. His remarks were criticized by supporters of Periyar. In response to the backlash, Rajinikanth stated, &quot;I did not speak on something that didn&#x27;t happen. I&#x27;ve only spoken on what was reported. It was reported in &quot;Outlook&quot; also. Sorry, I will not apologise.&quot; A report on Thoothukudi police firing criticized Rajnikanth&#x27;s comment on the incident that the whole anti-Sterlite protest was engineered by &quot;anti-social&quot; elements.

== Filmography ==

Rajinikanth appeared in over 170 films, predominantly in Tamil cinema. He began his film career by playing antagonistic and supporting roles before graduating to a lead actor. He has also worked in other Indian film industries such as Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Bengali. Alongside Indian films, he has also appeared in an English film.

== Accolades ==

Rajinikanth has received numerous awards for many of his films, mostly in Tamil. He received his first and only Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actor in 1984 for &quot;Nallavanuku Nallavan&quot;. Later he received Filmfare Award nominations for his performances in &quot;Sivaji&quot; (2007) and &quot;Enthiran&quot; (2010). As of 2014, Rajinikanth has received six Tamil Nadu State Film Awards for his performances in various films. He also received numerous awards from Cinema Express and Filmfans&#x27; Association for his on-screen performances and off-screen contributions in writing and producing.

Rajinikanth received the Kalaimamani award in 1984 and the M. G. R. Award in 1989, both from the Government of Tamil Nadu. In 1995, the South Indian Film Artistes&#x27; Association presented him with the Kalaichelvam Award. He was honoured with the Padma Bhushan (2000) and the Padma Vibhushan (2016) by the Government of India. He was selected as the Indian Entertainer of the Year for 2007 by NDTV, competing against the likes of Shahrukh Khan. The Government of Maharashtra honoured him with the Raj Kapoor Award the same year. He received the Chevalier Sivaji Ganesan Award for Excellence in Indian Cinema at the 4th Vijay Awards. Rajinikanth was also named one of the most influential persons in South Asia by &quot;Asiaweek&quot;.

He was named by &quot;Forbes India&quot; as the most influential Indian of the year 2010. In 2011, he was awarded the Entertainer of the Decade Award by NDTV for the year 2010 by the then Indian Minister for Home Affairs P. Chidambaram. In December 2013, he was honoured by NDTV as one among the &quot;25 Greatest Global Living Legends&quot;. In 2014, he was presented with the Indian Film Personality of the Year Award at the 45th IFFI.

<text>Parliamentary elections were held in Latvia on 30 September and 1 October 1995. The Democratic Party &quot;Saimnieks&quot; emerged as the largest party in the Saeima, winning 18 of the 100 seats.

==Results==
==Aftermath==
Both parties of government, Latvian Way and Latvian Farmers&#x27; Union were punished by the voters, losing a substantial number of seats. With no party able to form a working majority, a new government was formed led by independent Andris Šķēle.

<text>Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a biological process that adjusts the strength of connections between neurons in the brain. The process adjusts the connection strengths based on the relative timing of a particular neuron&#x27;s output and input action potentials (or spikes). The STDP process partially explains the activity-dependent development of nervous systems, especially with regard to long-term potentiation and long-term depression.

== Process ==
Under the STDP process, if an input spike to a neuron tends, on average, to occur immediately &quot;before&quot; that neuron&#x27;s output spike, then that particular input is made somewhat stronger. If an input spike tends, on average, to occur immediately &quot;after&quot; an output spike, then that particular input is made somewhat weaker hence: &quot;spike-timing-dependent plasticity&quot;. Thus, inputs that might be the cause of the post-synaptic neuron&#x27;s excitation are made even more likely to contribute in the future, whereas inputs that are not the cause of the post-synaptic spike are made less likely to contribute in the future. The process continues until a subset of the initial set of connections remain, while the influence of all others is reduced to 0. Since a neuron produces an output spike when many of its inputs occur within a brief period, the subset of inputs that remain are those that tended to be correlated in time. In addition, since the inputs that occur before the output are strengthened, the inputs that provide the earliest indication of correlation will eventually become the final input to the neuron.

== History ==
In 1973, M. M. Taylor suggested that if synapses were strengthened for which a presynaptic spike occurred just before a postsynaptic spike more often than the reverse (Hebbian learning), while with the opposite timing or in the absence of a closely timed presynaptic spike, synapses were weakened (anti-Hebbian learning), the result would be an informationally efficient recoding of input patterns. This proposal apparently passed unnoticed in the neuroscientific community, and subsequent experimentation was conceived independently of these early suggestions.

Early experiments on associative plasticity were carried out by W. B. Levy and O. Steward in 1983 and examined the effect of relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials at millisecond level on plasticity. Bruce McNaughton contributed much to this area, too.
In studies on neuromuscular synapses carried out by Y. Dan and Mu-ming Poo in 1992, and on the hippocampus by D. Debanne, B. Gähwiler, and S. Thompson in 1994, showed that asynchronous pairing of postsynaptic and synaptic activity induced long-term synaptic depression. However, STDP was more definitively demonstrated by Henry Markram in his postdoc period till 1993 in Bert Sakmann&#x27;s lab (SFN and Phys Soc abstracts in 1994–1995) which was only published in 1997. C. Bell and co-workers also found a form of STDP in the cerebellum. Henry Markram used dual patch clamping techniques to repetitively activate pre-synaptic neurons 10 milliseconds before activating the post-synaptic target neurons, and found the strength of the synapse increased. When the activation order was reversed so that the pre-synaptic neuron was activated 10 milliseconds after its post-synaptic target neuron, the strength of the pre-to-post synaptic connection decreased. Further work, by Guoqiang Bi, Li Zhang, and Huizhong Tao in Mu-Ming Poo&#x27;s lab in 1998, continued the mapping of the entire time course relating pre- and post-synaptic activity and synaptic change, to show that in their preparation synapses that are activated within 5–20 ms before a postsynaptic spike are strengthened, and those that are activated within a similar time window after the spike are transiently weakened. It has since been shown that the initially highly asymmetric STDP window turns into a more symmetric &quot;LTP only&quot; window three days after induction. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity is thought to be a substrate for Hebbian learning during development. As suggested by Taylor in 1973, Hebbian learning rules might create informationally efficient coding in bundles of related neurons. While STDP was first discovered in cultured neurons and brain slice preparations, it has also been demonstrated by sensory stimulation of intact animals.

== Biological mechanisms ==

Postsynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are highly sensitive to the membrane potential (see coincidence detection in neurobiology). Due to their high permeability for calcium, they generate a local chemical signal that is largest when the back-propagating action potential in the dendrite arrives shortly after the synapse was active (&quot;pre-post spiking&quot;), when NMDA and AMPA receptors are still bound to glutamate. Large postsynaptic calcium transients are known to trigger synaptic potentiation (long-term potentiation). The mechanism for spike-timing-dependent depression is less well understood, but often involves either postsynaptic voltage-dependent calcium entry/mGluR activation, or retrograde endocannabinoids and presynaptic NMDARs.

== From Hebbian rule to STDP ==

According to the Hebbian rule, synapses increase their efficiency if the synapse persistently takes part in firing the postsynaptic target neuron. Similarly, the efficiency of synapses decreases when the firing of their presynaptic targets is persistently independent of firing their postsynaptic ones. These principles are often simplified in the mnemonics: &quot;those who fire together, wire together&quot;; and &quot;those who fire out of sync, lose their link&quot;. However, if two neurons fire exactly at the same time, then one cannot have caused, or taken part in firing the other. Instead, to take part in firing the postsynaptic neuron, the presynaptic neuron needs to fire just before the postsynaptic neuron. Experiments that stimulated two connected neurons with varying interstimulus asynchrony confirmed the importance of temporal relation implicit in Hebb&#x27;s principle: for the synapse to be potentiated or depressed, the presynaptic neuron has to fire just before or just after the postsynaptic neuron, respectively. In addition, it has become evident that the presynaptic neural firing needs to consistently predict the postsynaptic firing for synaptic plasticity to occur robustly, mirroring at a synaptic level what is known about the importance of contingency in classical conditioning, where zero contingency procedures prevent the association between two stimuli.

== Role in hippocampal learning ==

For the most efficient STDP, the presynaptic and postsynaptic signal has to be separated by approximately a dozen milliseconds. However, events happening within a couple of minutes can typically be linked together by the hippocampus as episodic memories. To resolve this contradiction, a mechanism relying on the theta waves and the phase precession has been proposed: Representations of different memory entities (such as a place, face, person etc.) are repeated on each theta cycle at a given theta phase during the episode to be remembered. Expected, ongoing, and completed entities have early, intermediate and late theta phases, respectively. In the CA3 region of the hippocampus, the recurrent network turns entities with neighboring theta phases into coincident ones thereby allowing STDP to link them together. Experimentally detectable memory sequences are created this way by reinforcing the connection between subsequent (neighboring) representations.

== Computational models and applications ==

=== Training spiking neural networks ===
The principles of STDP can be utilized in the training of artificial spiking neural networks. Using this approach the weight of a connection between two neurons is increased if the time at which a presynaptic spike (formula_1) occurs is shortly before the time of a post synaptic spike(formula_2), ie. formula_3 and formula_4. The size of the weight increase is dependent on the value of formula_5 and decreases exponentially as the value of formula_5 increases given by the equation:

formula_7

where formula_8 is the maximum possible change and formula_9 is the time constant. 

If the opposite scenario occurs ie a post synaptic spike occurs before a presynaptic spike then the weight is instead reduced according to the equation:

formula_10

Where formula_11and formula_12 serve the same function of defining the maximum possible change and time constant as before respectively. 

The parameters that define the decay profile (formula_8,formula_11, etc.) do not necessarily have to be fixed across the entire network and different synapses may have different shapes associated with them. 

Biological evidence suggests that this pairwise STDP approach cannot give a complete description of a biological neuron and more advanced approaches which look at symmetric triplets of spikes (pre-post-pre, post-pre-post) have been developed and these are believed to be more biologically plausible.

<doc id="613541" wikidata="Q1417787" url="?curid=613541" title="Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948">
<text>The Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance of 1948, also known as the YYA Treaty from the Finnish () (Swedish: was the basis for Finno–Soviet relations from 1948 to 1992. It was the main instrument in implementing the Finnish policy called Paasikivi–Kekkonen doctrine.

Under the treaty, which was signed on 6 April 1948, the Soviets sought to deter Western or Allied Powers from attacking the Soviet Union through Finnish territory, and the Finns sought to increase Finland&#x27;s political independence from the Soviet Union. It thus ensured Finland&#x27;s survival as a liberal democracy in close proximity to strategic Soviet regions, such as the Kola Peninsula and the old capital Leningrad.

Under the pact, Finland was obliged to resist armed attacks by &quot;Germany or its allies&quot; (in reality interpreted as &quot;the United States and allies&quot;) against Finland, or against the Soviet Union through Finland. If necessary, Finland was to ask for Soviet military aid to do so. However the pact in itself did not provide any provisions for the Soviet military to enter Finland and stipulated that all such actions would have to be agreed separately should Finland choose to request aid. Furthermore, the pact did not place any requirements for Finland to act should the Soviet Union be attacked (if the attack would not take place through Finland). The agreement also recognized Finland&#x27;s desire to remain outside great-power conflicts, allowing the country to adopt a policy of neutrality in the Cold War.

Due to the uncertain status of Finno–Soviet relations in the years after the Continuation War, and the precise interpretation of the treaty&#x27;s wording, Finland followed the Eastern Bloc countries&#x27; decision and did not participate in the Marshall Plan. As a result, Finland&#x27;s post-war period of economic hardship was prolonged, compared to other European capitalist countries, and it thus became considerably more economically dependent on the Soviet Union. In general, Finland kept its relations towards western military powers officially distant (including the proposed Scandinavian Defense Union) and NATO in particular. By avoiding supporting the West, it attempted to fend off Soviet pressure for affiliation with the Warsaw Pact. No joint military exercises were ever held, and other military cooperation was minimal, despite occasional Soviet advances.

The YYA Treaty was a cornerstone in Paasikivi&#x27;s foreign policy. It was also a central policy under the presidency of Urho Kekkonen (1956–1981), who dubbed his foreign policy doctrine &quot;the Paasikivi-Kekkonen line.&quot; The treaty was an instrumental tool for the Soviet Union to gain political leverage in the internal affairs of Finland in post-war era, in confrontations such as the note crisis. This influence was commonly referred to as Finlandization. It is hotly debated to what degree President Kekkonen (President 1956–1981) intentionally used it to further his own influence and damage his opponents.

Despite the official policy, there was some secret co-operation with the West. This ranged from Finnish organizations such as the Social Democratic Party accepting U.S. Central Intelligence Agency funding to sharing of seismic data on nuclear tests. Likewise, Eastern Bloc countries conducted espionage in Finland, e.g., the East German Stasi had agents there.

The Soviet Union had similar agreements with many nations that were not directly allied with it but depended heavily on Soviet support, such as North Korea since 1961, with India since 1971, and Vietnam since 1978. The first such agreement, however, was with Free France on 10 December 1944.

The treaty came to an end in 1992 with the signing of a new treaty () between Finland and the post-Soviet Russia.

<doc id="613542" wikidata="Q85763848" url="?curid=613542" title="Going steady">
<text>Going steady is when two romantic partners agree to an exclusive relationship. Growing in prevalence in the United States after World War II, this pattern became mainstream in high schools and colleges in the 1950s. Its popularity continued through the 1980s, with teenagers beginning to go steady at progressively earlier ages. However, the label &quot;going steady&quot; fell into disuse in the 1970s.

==Definitions==
A survey of college students in 1955 found a distinction between &quot;going steadily&quot; with someone, which indicated dating the same person repeatedly, and &quot;going steady&quot; which indicated a formalized or explicit agreement. Going steady often involved an exchange of clothing or jewelry which would be worn to announce the state of the relationship. Couples might exchange identification bracelets or &quot;friendship rings&quot;.

Sociologists include group recognition of the couple&#x27;s status as part of the definition of going steady.

According to &quot;A Girl&#x27;s Guide to Dating and Going Steady&quot; (1968), a couple are going steady when they were &quot;seeing each other exclusively one or more times a week for a fairly long period of time.&quot; Another researcher defined it as &quot;the stage when both partners come to a mutual implicit understanding that dating will exclude others.&quot;

==From playing the field to going steady==

Before World War II, high school and college students generally dated multiple people, colloquially called &quot;playing the field&quot;. Dating patterns involved variety and competition, and multiple partners were a signal of popularity. Sociologists characterize this form of dating as &quot;competitive&quot;. In 1937, sociologist Willard Waller, based on a study at Penn State College, described it as a &quot;Rating and Dating Complex&quot; in which males and females were rated in popularity by themselves and their peers on characteristics such as having money and good clothes, belonging to the best sorority or fraternity, and dating the &quot;right&quot; people, although later researchers question whether Waller&#x27;s observations reflected as widespread a pattern as he implied and note that some individuals chose to pair off exclusively before it became the style.

Steady dating began to supplant casual dating in the 1940s. During the war, there was a rapid move away from &quot;competitive&quot; dating (having the most and best dating partners) and toward committed relationships (going steady). There is speculation that the emphasis on early marriage during and after WWII was linked to the impulse to go steady. Some historians credit the shortage of male partners during the war; however, the end of the war did not end the practice, and going steady became even more pervasive after the war ended. Going steady was a frequent theme in popular teen novels of the time. High school students were expected to enter committed heterosexual relationships or become socially marginalized. Sociologist Wini Breines characterizes it as &quot;a routinized sexual system that controlled and punished female spontaneity and ensured that young women followed the prescribed steps to marriage&quot;.

A study in the 1950s found that three-fourths of the girls and more than half of the boys in grades 11 and 12 had gone steady, many for a year or longer. A 1959 &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; article was titled &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Go Steady, You&#x27;re Different&quot;. A study in the 1980s of high school in Connecticut found 81% of girls and almost 70% of boys had gone steady. Daly, in the 1951 &quot;Profiles of Youth&quot;, quotes a high school principal: &quot;In this school, a girl either goes steady or she doesn&#x27;t date at all. And after two or three dates with one boy, she&#x27;s considered going steady whether she wants to or not.&quot;

==Peer opinions==

The trend toward having a single, exclusive romantic partner was accompanied by growing disapproval among peers of those who dated multiple partners. Sexual experimenting outside of the steady relationship had the consequence of being labelled promiscuous.

While a small study in 1940 and 1941 found some peer disapproval of going steady, by 1960 it was widely accepted and only a small minority of peers disapproved. Contemporary studies found that going steady was viewed as a stage toward marriage by some participants, while to others it was a common social behavior with no goal of marriage. The seriousness of intent when going steady often differed between classes: students with plans to attend college took a high school steady relationship less seriously than working class students who would be more likely to view it as a relationship that might progress to marriage.

Going steady was recognized and sanctioned by peer groups, and provided a form of status similar to being engaged. Friends and acquaintances recognized the relationship and had expectations of acceptable behavior when going steady. For example, when one cannot attend an event, the other is expected to be absent as well. Other boys should not ask the girl out, and the girl should not date or flirt with other boys.

==Adult opinions==
The trend of going steady was met with concern and disapproval by adults. A 1951 book, &quot;Profiles of Youth&quot;, called going steady &quot;a national problem&quot;, and said teens&#x27; greatest concern was &quot;whether to go steady&quot;. Some parochial schools forbid the practice after Catholic leaders declared &quot;going steady is a proximate occasion of sin&quot;. Advice columnist Dorothy Dix wrote, &quot;The custom has all of the worst features of marriage and none of its advantages.&quot; Another syndicated columnist, Doris Blake wrote &quot;It&#x27;s simply a pernicious habit grown out of we-don&#x27;t-know-what that has fostered this ridiculous custom of a couple of 16, 17, or 18 year olds pairing off to the exclusion of everyone else on the dance floor.&quot; &quot;Life&quot; magazine featured an article on the subject, noting that 65% of students in some high schools were going steady, and a column in &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; discussed the issue.

The primary concern with going steady was the perception that it would lead to greater intimacy and sexual experimentation than casual dating. According to Breines, &quot;Although the social scientific surveys indicate little evidence of a dramatic increase in sexual intercourse among teenagers in the postwar period, adults believed there was such an increase.&quot; Both white teens and girls of color tended to limit their sexual activity to steady relationships. Reliable data on teen sexual behavior pre- and post-war is sparse, and historians argue whether the rate of premarital intercourse rose gradually or sharply through the 1960s. Rates of premarital pregnancy and data about venereal disease in teens over the years suggest that increasing numbers of teenagers were engaging in sexual intercourse. A study in the 1990s found that there was a greater association between early sexual activity and going steady than with frequent casual dating. A 2004 study also found that the majority of adolescents first have sex when going steady. Studies conflict on whether going steady had more association with use of birth control or less. Littauer states &quot;Being in love and going steady was more significant to a young woman&#x27;s decision to have sex than was class, education, religion, or any other factor.&quot;

A secondary concern was that going steady would inhibit teens&#x27; social development. Experts warned that going steady would limit one to inadequate experience getting to know different people and could result in bad choices. A YWCA publication said a steady relationship would &quot;reduce your opportunities for knowing other congenial people whom you might enjoy.&quot; Although some experts criticize going steady as limiting a person&#x27;s exposure to potential partners, &quot;playing the field&quot; results in only superficial exposure to those potential partners. According to Herman, &quot;quantity and variety of experience is not necessarily a good substitute for quality, in the sense that going steady may allow more thorough and penetrating learning processes to occur.&quot;

By the late 1960s, the sexual revolution of the counterculture was the new fear of adults, and going steady had become more accepted.

==Reasons for going steady and breaking up==

Some self-reported motivations for going steady include:
* For acceptance and to fit in with their peer groups
* For security
* To avoid the discomfort of competing for dates

Reasons for ending the steady relationship include:
*Getting too serious
*Not enough in common
*They find the lack of freedom restricting
*They want someone else or someone different

==Trends==

Surveys of college women, repeated in ten-year intervals from 1958 to 1978, found an increase in both the numbers who had gone steady, earlier ages for going steady, and a large decrease in number of dating partners, as shown in the following table:

<text>Virginia Zeani (born Virginia Zehan; 21 October 1925 – 20 March 2023) was a Romanian-born opera singer who sang leading soprano roles in the opera houses of Europe and North America.

As a singer, she was known for her dramatic intensity and the beauty, wide range, and suppleness of her voice, which allowed her to sing a repertoire of 69 roles ranging from the heroines in belcanto operas by Rossini and Donizetti to those of Wagner, Puccini and Verdi. She also created roles in several 20th-century operas, including Blanche in Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Carmelites&quot;.

Zeani made her professional debut in 1948 as Violetta in &quot;La traviata&quot;, which would become one of her signature roles; she performed this role over 640 times.

After her retirement from the stage in 1982, she became a well-known voice teacher. She was married to the Italian bass Nicola Rossi-Lemeni from 1957 until his death in 1991. They both taught at Indiana University&#x27;s Jacobs School of Music for many years (and continued to teach singing privately afterwards). She spent her last years in Palm Beach County, Florida.

==Early life and education==
Zeani was born on 21 October 1925 in Solovăstru, a central Transylvania village located in Romania. She has described to interviewers a childhood where, despite bronchial troubles, she was always singing, even when she was fetching water from the river for cooking. She said that music had &quot;entered her soul&quot; after hearing a band of gypsies, one of whom was playing a hora on the violin, and at the age of nine she became determined to be an opera singer after hearing a performance of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;. 

When she was 13 a benefactor in the village paid for her to study singing in Bucharest with Lucia Anghel, a mezzo-soprano with whom she trained as a mezzo-soprano during her teenage years. As a young adult during World War II she began studying with Ukrainian soprano Lydia Lipkowska in Bucharest. Lipkowska disagreed with Anghel&#x27;s assessment of her voice as a mezzo-soprano, and retrained her voice as a soprano. Zeani stated of her experience during this time

I had no high notes at all at that point in my life, but after she accepted me and I worked with her for three months I had an incredible range.

After World War II ended, Zeani emigrated to Italy and continued her vocal studies in Milan. By then she knew the leading soprano roles in four operas by heart—the title role in &quot;Manon&quot;, Marguerite in &quot;Faust&quot;, Violetta in &quot;La traviata&quot; and Mimì in &quot;La bohème&quot;. In Milan she had extensive coaching with the conductor Antonio Narducci. She also sought out the tenor Aureliano Pertile, who had long been one of her idols for the beauty of his phrasing and diction. She called at his house and, according to Zeani, when he opened the door she burst into tears and was unable to speak. Pertile&#x27;s wife ushered her inside and, after talking to her, Pertile accepted her as a student on a non-paying basis, giving her private lessons and allowing her to attend his master classes. She repaid him by running errands and helping his wife with household chores.

==Operatic career==

Zeani made her professional debut as Violetta in &quot;La traviata&quot; at the Teatro Duse in Bologna in 1948 as a last-minute replacement for Margherita Carosio. It was to become her signature role. one she sang 648 times during the course of her career. 

She initially sang in Italian regional opera houses but also began appearing abroad. In 1950 and 1951 she sang in Egypt in private concerts for King Farouk as well as in a series of operas in Cairo and Alexandria. She also sang Violetta in Geneva in 1952 and at London&#x27;s Stoll Theatre in 1953. 

She made her Florence debut as Elvira in &quot;I puritani&quot; in 1952, replacing Maria Callas, who had withdrawn from the production after two performances. It was during the &quot;Puritani&quot; performances that she first met her future husband, the Italian bass Nicola Rossi-Lemeni. 

They met again in 1956 when she made her La Scala debut as Cleopatra in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;, opposite Rossi-Lemeni as her Giulio Cesare. He soon proposed and the couple married in 1957. A year later their son Alessandro was born. Zeani and Rossi-Lemeni made their home in Rome and would appear together in thirteen more operas.

At the start of her career Zeani had specialised in coloratura roles including Lucia in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, Elvira in &quot;I puritani&quot;, Gilda in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, and Adèle in &quot;Le comte Ory&quot;. However, in a 1960 production at the Teatro dell&#x27;Opera di Roma she sang all three heroines in &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; — Olympia (coloratura soprano), Antonia (lyric soprano), and Giulietta (dramatic soprano). Rossi-Lemeni appeared in the same production playing all four villains — Lindorf, Coppelius, Dr. Miracle, and Dappertutto. From 1970 she increasingly assayed the heavier dramatic soprano roles with great success, notably the title roles in &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, and &quot;Fedora&quot;. She also sang Elsa in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; and Senta in his &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;.

Zeani sang 69 roles in the course of her career in a wide-ranging repertoire. She sang in important revivals of Verdi&#x27;s early and now rarely performed opera &quot;Alzira&quot; (Rome, 1970) and belcanto operas such as Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Maria di Rohan&quot; (Naples 1965) and Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; (Rome, 1968), but she also sang in the world premieres and early performances of several 20th-century operas. She created the roles of Giannina in Jacopo Napoli&#x27;s &quot;Un curioso accidente&quot; (Bergamo, 1950), Blanche in Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Carmelites&quot; (Milan, 1957), Alissa in Raffaello de Banfield&#x27;s &quot;Alissa&quot; (Geneva, 1965) and Irene in Renzo Rossellini&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;avventuriero&quot; (Monte Carlo, 1968). She also sang Mary Vetsera in the first staging of Barbara Giuranna&#x27;s dodecaphonic opera &quot;Mayerling&quot; (Naples, 1960), a role written expressly for her. Her other roles in 20th-century works include Magda Sorel in &quot;The Consul&quot; and Eunomia in Adriano Lualdi&#x27;s &quot;Il diavolo nel campanile&quot; (both under Tullio Serafin at the Maggio Musicale in Florence) and multiple performances of &quot;La voix humaine&quot; in the 1970s.

By the time she had begun her career as a voice teacher in 1980, Zeani had basically retired from the stage, but she returned in 1982 for her last opera performance, Mother Marie in &quot;Dialogues of the Carmelites&quot; at the San Francisco Opera.

==Teaching career and later life==
In 1980 Zeani and Rossi-Lemeni settled in the United States where they had been offered teaching positions at Indiana University&#x27;s Jacobs School of Music. She continued teaching there after Rossi-Lemeni&#x27;s death in 1991 and was awarded the title of Distinguished Professor of Music in 1994. Among her many students at the Jacobs School who went on to international careers as opera singers are Angela Brown, Nicole Chevalier, Vivica Genaux, Sylvia McNair, Marilyn Mims, Mark Nicolson, Susan Patterson, Elizabeth Futral, Marina Levitt and Ailyn Perez. 

Zeani retired to West Palm Beach, Florida in 2004, but continued to teach students privately. She was awarded Indiana University&#x27;s President&#x27;s Medal for Excellence in 2012 and received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the National Association of Teachers of Singing in 2016 and the National Opera Association in 2017. In 2010, she was named the &quot;Classical Singer&quot; Teacher of the Year. That year, she was also presented with the Marcello Giordani Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2017, the Virginia Zeani Festival had its inaugural season in Mures, Romania.

Zeani died in Florida on 20 March 2023, aged 97, following a lengthy cardiac respiratory illness.

==Recordings==
Zeani&#x27;s recorded legacy largely rests on the approximately 60 &quot;pirate&quot; and &quot;off-air&quot; recordings of full-length operas made in the course of her career. She made very few studio recordings—&quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;La traviata&quot; and a Verdi–Puccini recital released on LP by the Romanian Electrecord label, and a two-LP set of Donizetti, Bellini, Verdi, and Puccini arias on the Decca label, recorded when Zeani was in her early 30s. In 2014, Decca reissued the LPs on compact disk in their &quot;Most Wanted Recitals!&quot; series.

==Honors==
Zeani was made Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 1965. In her native Romania she received the Royal Decoration of Nihil Sine Deo in 2011 and was made a Knight of the Order of the Star of Romania in 2016. She has also been the recipient of numerous opera awards, including the Puccini Award from the Fondazione Festival Pucciniano in 1992.

<doc id="613548" wikidata="Q606153" url="?curid=613548" title="Port Macquarie">
<text>Port Macquarie, sometimes shortened to Port Mac and commonly locally nicknamed Port, is a coastal city on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, Australia, north of Sydney, and south of Brisbane, on the Tasman Sea coast at the mouth of the Hastings River, and the eastern end of the Oxley Highway (B56). It had a population of 47,974 in 2018, and an estimated population of 51,965 in 2023.
==History==
===Indigenous===
Port Macquarie sits within Birpai (Biripi, Bripi, Biripai, Birrbay) country, and the Birpai people are recognised as the traditional custodians of the land on which Port Macquarie is located. Port Macquarie was long known to the Birpai people as Guruk. The Birpai Local Aboriginal Land Council provides positive support, information and responsible governance for the Aboriginal community, while also cultivating strong links with the broader community.

Before British colonisation, large clans of Birpai people resided in and around Port Macquarie, particularly at places such as King&#x27;s Creek, Blackman&#x27;s Point, Camden Haven and Rolland&#x27;s Plains. They lived in large domed huts which provided protection against the region&#x27;s heavy rains and were capable of accommodating up to ten people.

===British exploration===
The first documented visit to the site of Port Macquarie by the British was in 1818 when an expedition led by John Oxley reached the Pacific Ocean from the interior, after his journey to explore inland New South Wales. Oxley named the location after the Governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie.

Oxley noted that &quot;the natives in the vicinity of the port appeared very numerous...were all handsome, well-made men, stout in their persons, and showing evident signs of good living...were evidently acquainted with the use of firearms...their dread of its appearance&quot;, and that &quot;the port abounds with fish, the sharks were larger and more numerous than I have ever before observed...the forest hills and rising grounds abounded with large kangaroos and the marshes afford shelter and support to innumerable wildfowl. Independent of the Hastings River, the area is generally well watered, there is a fine spring at the very entrance to the Port.&quot;

===Convict settlement===
In 1821, Port Macquarie was founded as a penal settlement, replacing Newcastle as the destination for convicts who had committed secondary crimes in New South Wales. Newcastle, which had fulfilled this role for the previous two decades, had lost the features required for a place for dumping irredeemable criminals, that being isolation, which was lost as the Hunter Region was opened up to farmers, and large amounts of hard labor, which had diminished as the cedar in the area ran out and the settlement grew in size.

Port Macquarie, however, with its thick bush, tough terrain, large military presence and Indigenous Australians such as Bob Barrett (also called Monunggal) who were employed as &#x27;bush constables&#x27; returning escaped prisoners for tobacco and blankets, provided large amounts of both isolation and hard labour to keep the criminals in control. Under the various commandants, such as Francis Allman who was fond of flogging, the convicts had limited liberties and punishments regularly included whippings of up to 50 lashes at a time and hard labour in double leg irons.

The penal settlement lasted from April 1821 to June 1832. The settlement peaked with 1500 convicts by 1825 but by 1828 this had fallen to 530. The commanders of the settlement were:
* Captain Francis Allman, April 1821 – April 1824
* Captain John Rolland, April 1824 – November 1824
* Lieutenant George Carmac, November 1824 – December 1824
* Captain Henry Gillman, January 1824 – February 1826
* Captain Samuel Wright, February 1826 – November 1826
* Captain Archibald Clunes Innes, November 1826 – April 1827
* Lieutenant Thomas Owen, April 1827 – October 1827
* Captain Francis Crotty, October 1827 – June 1828
* Captain Henry Smyth, November 1828 – June 1832

During the 1820s, merchants such as Simeon Lord and Solomon Wiseman utilised the convict labour to extract large amounts of cedar and rosewood timber upriver from Port Macquarie. Governor Ralph Darling later sent there many &#x27;specials&#x27; or literate convicts with a decent education who had voiced negative views about him. As the penal settlement was wound down from the late 1820s, disabled convicts began to make up a significant proportion of the population. One-armed men would be grouped together and required to break stones, men with wooden legs would become delivery men, and the blind would often be given tasks during the night which they performed more skilfully than those with sight.

In November 1821, Port Macquarie became the site of the first sugar cane to be cultivated in Australia. James Williams, an Afro-American convict from Antigua with knowledge of cane-growing, was placed in charge. This colonial government funded plantation worked by convict labourers was later expanded to the nearby Rollands Plains and Ballengarra areas under the management of Thomas A. Scott. Flood, drought and fire caused the plantations to be abandoned by 1831. Scott later lived near Gosford, where the suburb Tascott is named after him.
St Thomas&#x27;s Anglican Church is a Georgian building designed by Francis Greenway and built, under the supervision of military engineer Lieutenant T. Owen, by convicts from 1824 to 1828. This church is among the oldest in Australia and one of the few remaining convict-built churches. Inside there are red cedar box pews that were peculiar to that period in church architecture. The Walker pipe organ is the only one of its type in the southern hemisphere. The castellated tower permits excellent views of the coastline, town and river. This church is now classified by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) and has been registered on the National Estate heritage list.

In 1830 Major Archibald Clunes Innes built Lake Innes House which grew over the next decade into a luxurious establishment and attracted many notable visitors. It is now a ruin and is managed by the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service.

===Frontier conflict===
As the British encroached into the region from 1821, bloody conflict between the colonisers and the resident Indigenous people occurred. The first recorded incident happened in November 1821 where a convict cedar-getter was killed upriver from Port Macquarie. In 1823, an exploratory party of soldiers shot down two groups of Aboriginal people near Telegraph Point and Ballengarra, causing those who survived to afterwards have great fear of the redcoats.

In 1825, after two convict shingle-splitters were killed at Blackman&#x27;s Point, a detachment of soldiers from the 3rd Regiment of Foot were sent out on a punitive expedition. They shot dead a great number of Aboriginal people, afterwards raping then killing the captured females. This has become known as the Blackman&#x27;s Point massacre.

In 1830, a stockman was killed by Aboriginal people at Rollands Plains, leading the commandant at the time, Captain Henry Smyth, to issue an edict prohibiting &#x27;the natives&#x27; from carrying anything resembling weapons near the British settlements on pain of death. In 1837, further violence occurred at Kogo where three cedar-getters were killed. Several Aboriginal men, including Wombarty and Terrimitchie were arrested for the crime. Terrimitchie was later found guilty and hanged in Port Macquarie. Frontier conflict in the region appears to have ended by the 1840s.

===Free settlement===
The region was first opened to settlers in 1830 and soon after the penal settlement was closed. Settlers quickly took advantage of the area&#x27;s good pastoral land, timber resources and fisheries.
The first land grants along the Hastings River were assigned in 1830 to people such as Jeremiah Warlters, William Cross and Matthew Mitchell.

===Township of Port Macquarie===
A town plan of Port Macquarie was produced by F. R. D&#x27;Arcy in 1831 and most of the first allotments were given out in the same year to military men associated with the penal colony such as Lieutenant Matthew Mitchell and Major A.C. Innes.

In 1840 the Wool Road from the Northern Tablelands was under construction to enable wool and other produce to be shipped from the port. Port Macquarie was declared a municipality in 1887, but the town never progressed as a port owing to a notorious coastal bar across the mouth of the river.

Over 20 shipwrecks occurred in the Tacking Point area before a lighthouse was designed by James Barnet and erected there in 1879 by Shepard and Mortley. Tacking Point Lighthouse is classified by the National Trust of Australia (NSW).

Writer Louis Becke was born and grew up in the town in the 1860s and later recalled those days, saying Port Macquarie was an,

===Modern development and events===
In the 1970s, Grace Easterbrook, a retired secretary from Scotland, began a campaign against the high-rise developments which were multiplying up the coast. She led a group of citizen activists in lobbying against a large development on Windmill Hill and other efforts to conserve the coast. In 1974, residents of Port Macquarie requested that the Builders Labourers Federation place a green ban against the construction of high rise buildings on beach head and water front. Easterbrook died in 1984, before the culmination of her conservation efforts, the beautiful coastal walks, were completed.

Severe flooding occurred in March 2021 when the Hastings River flooded during a severe weather event affecting much of New South Wales.

== Population ==
In 1847, the population was 819, of whom 599 were males and 220 were female. The gender disparity was probably due to the penal station there at the time.

== General ==
Port Macquarie is a coastal destination, known for its extensive beaches and waterways. The town is also known for its koala population, being the home to the Billabong Zoo (a wildlife park and koala breeding centre) and the Koala Preservation Society&#x27;s Koala Hospital, caring for koalas injured through bushfire, dog attacks and collisions with vehicles.

In 2016 the war memorial was relocated from Town Green to its original location at the intersection of Clarence and Horton Streets.

The residential suburbs stretch to Lighthouse Beach in the south, Thrumster to the west and to North Shore, on the northern bank of the river. In July 2010, Sovereign Hills began development in the west.

Port Macquarie was found to be the least affordable smaller market in Australia by Demographia&#x27;s 2013 International Housing Affordability Survey.

==Suburbs and localities==

=== Central business district ===
Port Macquarie&#x27;s central business district contains two shopping centres, many specialty stores, a marina, and the starting point for the 9 km coastal walk, a scenic walking trail that travels from Westport Park, through the Port Macquarie CBD to Tacking Point Lighthouse. The Glasshouse, a centrally located arts, conference and entertainment centre, includes a visitor-information facility. Bus services link the town with Laurieton, Wauchope, Kempsey, Lake Cathie and Bonny Hills.

The main shopping centre Port Central, sits next to the Glasshouse, a hub of culture and entertainment, boasting a 594-seat theatre, performance and art studio, gallery, visitor information centre, shop and theatre bar.

One of Australia&#x27;s largest internet finance comparison websites, Credit Card Compare, now called Finty, was founded in Port Macquarie by Andrew and David Boyd.

===Transit Hill===
Transit Hill to the south is crowned by telecommunication towers. The district is the site of two arterial roads which provide a direct link between Lighthouse Beach and Port Macquarie CBD. The main intersection of Pacific and Kennedy Drive is situated midway up Transit Hill. It is an area of high-priced real estate owing to ocean and city views. Transit Hill borders Lighthouse Beach, Dahlsford, Shelly Beach and Waniora.

===Sovereign Hills===
Sovereign Hills is a newer development in Port Macquarie, between the locality of Thrumster to the east, and the Pacific Highway to the west. Its development is currently managed by the Lewis Land Group. Most recent press releases have suggested that the area will have around 2500 homes when complete.

St Joseph&#x27;s Regional College moved from its previous location on Warlters Street to Sovereign Hills in 2009. A town centre is planned for opening in 2019, and has been advertised to initially include a supermarket, pharmacy and café. The local organisation Hastings Co-Op has announced that they will operate the supermarket to be built in this new town centre.

As of 2024, Sovereign Place Town Centre (shopping centre) features various outlets, including a grocery store, chemist, fitness centre and multiple restaurants and health and beauty services.

== Beaches and attractions ==
Beaches (in order from north to south) are: North Shore, Town Beach, Oxley Beach, Rocky Beach, Flynns Beach, Nobbys Beach, Shelly Beach, Miners Beach (unofficial clothing-optional) and Lighthouse Beach. Only Town, Flynns and Lighthouse Beaches are staffed by Surf Life Saving Clubs. Lighthouse Beach is patrolled at only the northern end. Dogs can be walked off-leash at Lighthouse Beach, south of Watonga Rocks, excluding sections at the northern end and Nobbys Beach.

Sea Acres National Park is adjacent to Shelly Beach and contains a visitor centre with access controlled rainforest boardwalk.

==Climate==

Port Macquarie has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) with warm, humid summers and short, mild winters, albeit with cool nights. Rainfall is spread throughout the year. In winter and spring, the town can occasionally be affected by foehn winds due to its leeward position of the Great Dividing Range. The town receives 118.9 clear days annually. In addition, it is the northernmost locality on the coast to receive southerly busters, although they are not as intense as those in the southern coast.

According to the CSIRO, Port Macquarie was considered the best climate in Australia due to its mild winters and pleasant summers, and also for its warm water for most of the year that is suited for swimming.

== Transport links ==

Port Macquarie Airport ( west of town) has regular flights to Sydney with QantasLink (five times daily) and Virgin Australia (twice daily), and to Lord Howe Island with QantasLink and Brisbane with Virgin Australia.

There is no railway station in Port Macquarie. However, the Port Macquarie CBD and northern suburbs are served by the nearby Wauchope railway station (17 km west of town), and the southern suburbs including satellite towns of Lake Cathie and Laurieton are served by Kendall railway station ( southwest). Both stations are on the North Coast Line operated by NSW TrainLink with three services daily in each direction towards either Sydney or northwards to Grafton, Casino and Brisbane. There is a railway-operated connecting bus service available from Wauchope railway station to the Port Macquarie CBD. The largest local bus operator is Busways while long distance services are operated by Greyhound Australia and Premier Motor Service.

Road access is via the Pacific and Oxley Highways. The Pacific Highway lies between Port Macquarie and Wauchope, and is the main road for tourists travelling from coastal areas.

Four significant nearby road projects have been completed in recent years to help with road traffic issues in the area:
* Pacific Highway – Karuah to Bulahdelah section 2 and 3 (Karuah to Bulahdelah section 1 – Completed December 2006).
* Pacific Highway – Bulahdelah Bypass The Bulahdelah bypass/upgrade fills the only missing Pacific Highway link between Hexham and Port Macquarie after the opening of the Karuah to Bulahdelah section(s) 2 and 3 and the Coopernook to Herons Creek upgrade.
* Pacific Highway – Coopernook to Herons Creek.
* The Oxley Highway upgrade, from a 2 lane undivided road to a 4-lane divided carriageway, from Wrights Road to the Pacific Highway.

These four projects are all from the AusLink funding on a joint basis from the Commonwealth and the state of NSW making equal financial contributions.

<text>Grigory Ivanovich Kulik (; ; 9 November 1890 – 24 August 1950) was a Soviet military commander and Marshal of the Soviet Union who served as chief of the Red Army&#x27;s Main Artillery Directorate from 1937 until June 1941.

Born into a Ukrainian peasant family near Poltava, Kulik served as an artillery officer in the Imperial Russian Army during the First World War. On the outbreak of the Russian Revolution, he joined the Bolsheviks and the Red Army. He fought alongside Joseph Stalin at the Battle of Tsaritsyn during the Russian Civil War and quickly became one of Stalin&#x27;s most favoured generals. In 1937, he was named chief of the Main Artillery Directorate. Kulik had a highly conservative outlook in military technology and theory. He was a strong opponent to Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky&#x27;s reforms and his deep operations theory, and dismissed innovations such as the T-34 and KV-1 tanks and the Katyusha rocket artillery system.

Kulik was named First Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar for Defence in 1939, and later took part in the Soviet invasion of Poland. In 1940, he was named a Marshal of the Soviet Union. Kulik&#x27;s poor leadership during the Winter War in Finland and the German invasion of the Soviet Union led to his fall from grace. He was dismissed from his Artillery Directorate in late 1941, and in early 1942 he was court-martialed and demoted Major-General, but escaped execution thanks to his good relations with Stalin.

After the war, Stalin and Lavrentiy Beria began a new round of purges. Kulik was arrested for treason in 1947 and remained in prison until 1950, when Stalin ordered his execution.

==Early life==
Kulik was born into a peasant family of Ukrainian origin near Poltava. A soldier of the army of the Russian Empire in World War I, he served as a non-commissioned officer in the artillery. In 1917 he joined the Bolshevik Party and the Red Army during 1918.

==Civil war==
At the beginning of the Russian Civil War, his friendship with the Bolshevik Kliment Voroshilov caused him to join the Red Army, resulting in an introduction to Stalin and the command of the artillery of the 1st Cavalry Army (co-led by Stalin and Voroshilov) at the Battle of Tsaritsyn during 1918.

The position was almost entirely political in nature, a reward for Kulik joining the Reds and his loyalty to Voroshilov; Kulik himself did not have any experience with gun laying or commanding artillery crews, and the whole Bolshevik artillery force in Tsaritsyn consisted of 3 obsolete artillery pieces. Despite having little to no perceivable effect on the outcome of the battle, Kulik&#x27;s performance greatly impressed Stalin.

After the Civil War, Kulik continued as one of Stalin&#x27;s favored and most politically reliable generals during Poland&#x27;s 1919 invasion of the Soviet Union, which he commanded personally. His poor performance resulted in him being replaced by the former cavalry NCO Semyon Budyonny. Unfazed, Stalin promoted Kulik to the post of First Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar for Defense directed by Voroshilov.

== Artillery Directorate Chief ==
In 1937, Kulik was appointed chief of the Main Artillery Directorate, making him responsible for overseeing the development and production of new tanks, tank guns and artillery pieces.

Kulik retained his opinions of the Red Army as it was during 1918, the last time he had had a field command. He denounced Marshal Tukhachevsky&#x27;s campaign to redevelop the Red Army&#x27;s mechanized forces into independent units like the Wehrmacht&#x27;s Panzerkorps; the creation of separate divisions allowed them to use their greater maneuverability for Deep Battle-style maneuver warfare, rapidly exploiting breakthroughs rather than simply assisting the infantry. Correctly sensing that Stalin considered these new ideas as potential threats to his authority, Kulik successfully argued against the change.

In an anonymous section of a report on the Spanish Civil War, Kulik noted that tanks not facing anti-tank weaponry were effective on the battlefield. He and Voroshilov argued that Tukhachevsky&#x27;s theoretical style of warfare could not yet be carried out by the Red Army in its pre-war state, even if those theories were effective. Though Tukhachevsky was purged in 1937 because of Stalin and Voroshilov&#x27;s dislike for him, his theories were at that time already widely influential in the Red Army. Though Kulik and Voroshilov&#x27;s reforms moved the Red Army further away from deep operations doctrine, which had fallen out of favor due to many of its proponents being purged, as well as a lack of officers able to carry out the complicated operations required, the adjustment of Soviet military theory to better reflect the Red Army&#x27;s actual operational capability would have a positive impact of the performance of the army in the opening days of WWII. Marshal Georgi Zhukov&#x27;s use of deep operations techniques to great effect in Manchuria against the Japanese would eventually convince Stalin of their value, after which they were used effectively during Operation Bagration.

Kulik criticized Marshal Voroshilov&#x27;s endorsement of the production of the T-34 tank and his namesake KV-1 tanks, both of which would prove instrumental to the survival of the USSR. After Kulik was overruled by Stalin and ordered to produce the tanks anyway, he began deliberately delaying the production of ammunition and guns, resulting in a drastic shortage of 76.2mm shells. At the start of the war, no more than 12% of the T-34 and KV-1 tanks had a full ammunition load; few had any anti-tank rounds, most had no more than a few high explosive shells, and a shocking number had to rely solely on their coaxial machine guns, having no 76.2mm rounds at all. Many T-34 and KV-1 tanks were sent into battle underarmed and eventually had to be abandoned by their crews when they ran out of ammunition.

Prior to and during the early period of the war with Germany, Kulik interfered with the armament of the T-34 and KV-1 tanks. Though it was both more effective and cheaper than the L-11 gun then in use, Kulik opposed the adoption of the F-34 gun designed by Vasiliy Grabin&#x27;s workshop at the Joseph Stalin Factory No. 92, as he was a political patron for the Leningrad Kirov Plant, which manufactured the L-11. Due to his status, the relevant armament bureaucrats failed to approve the newer gun for fear of retaliation. This eventually necessitated a rushed retrofit of the KV-1 and T-34&#x27;s gun in the midst of the German invasion when it became apparent that the L-11 could not reliably penetrate even the lightly armored Panzer III, which was arriving in large numbers. This was facilitated by Grabin&#x27;s disobedience; with the endorsement of Kulik&#x27;s political enemies, he had secretly ordered the manufacture of a reserve stock of F-34 guns, predicting that they would soon be needed and that his decision would be lauded by Stalin once the gun had proven itself in battle. Grabin was correct; Kulik&#x27;s objections were outweighed by the many letters from Soviet tank crewmen to Stalin endorsing the new gun.

Kulik also disparaged the use of minefields as a defensive measure, considering this to be at odds with a properly aggressive strategy and terming minefields &quot;a weapon of the weak.&quot; This decision allowed for the essentially free movement of German forces across Russian defensive lines during Operation Barbarossa, with static defensive strongpoints being bypassed easily by Panzer spearheads and surrounded by infantry, forcing the defenders to surrender. He also zealously endorsed Stalin&#x27;s exhortations against retreat, allowing whole divisions to be encircled and annihilated or starved into surrendering &quot;en masse&quot;. Eventually, after Kulik&#x27;s demotion, the laying of multiple layers of anti-tank mines proved instrumental for both the successful defense of Leningrad during the German siege and the successful defensive actions against much stronger German armored forces at the Battle of Kursk.

Kulik similarly scorned the German issue of the MP-40 submachine gun to their shock troops, stating that it encouraged inaccuracy and excessive ammunition consumption among the rank and file. He forbade the issue of the submachine gun PPD-40 to his units, stating that it was only suitable as a police weapon. It was not until 1941, after widespread demand for a weapon to match the MP-40 again overruled Kulik&#x27;s restrictions, that a simple modification of the manufacturing process for the PPD-40 produced the PPSh-41, which proved to be amongst the most widely produced, inexpensive and effective small arms of the war, considered by many German infantrymen to be superior to the MP-40, with whole companies of Russian infantrymen eventually being issued the weapon for house-to-house fighting.

Kulik refused to endorse the production of the innovative Katyusha rocket artillery system, stating &quot;What the hell do we need rocket artillery for? The main thing is the horse-drawn gun.&quot; Although it could have been produced much earlier in the war without his meddling, the Katyusha rocket artillery system eventually proved to be one of the most effective Soviet inventions of the war and a major advance in artillery technology.

In 1939 he became Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar of Defense, also participating with the Soviet occupation of Eastern Poland in September. He commanded the Soviet&#x27;s artillery attack on Finland at the start of the Winter War, which quickly foundered.

On 5 May 1940, Kulik&#x27;s wife Kira Kulik-Simonich was kidnapped on Stalin&#x27;s orders, unknown to Kulik and for an uncertain reason. Kira, a mother to an eight-year old girl, was subsequently executed by NKVD executioner Vasili Blokhin in June 1940. It appears that Stalin then ordered the modern equivalent of a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; against the hapless woman; although she was described as very pretty, no photographs or other images of her survive. Two days later, on 7 May 1940, Kulik was promoted to Marshal of the Soviet Union. Although the public search for Kira continued for 12 years he soon married again.

Years after his appointment as Chief of Artillery (and his poor performance in two separate wars), Nikita Khrushchev questioned his competence, causing Stalin to rebuke him angrily: &quot;You don&#x27;t even know Kulik! I know him from the civil war when he commanded the artillery in Tsaritsyn. He knows artillery!&quot;

==World War II==
After the Soviet invasion of Poland, according to initial Red Army figures, over 450,000 Polish prisoners of war were taken into Soviet captivity. As deputy defense minister Kulik proposed initially to immediately release ethnic Ukrainian and Belarusian prisoners, apart from officers, this was done between 23–25 September 1939. Stalin was undecided about what to do with the rest of the prisoners and discussed the issue with his closest advisors. Kulik proposed freeing them all, a sentiment which Marshal Kliment Voroshilov shared. Senior political commissar Lev Mekhlis insisted that there were enemies among them but Kulik persisted and Stalin compromised. The Polish prisoners were released except for the officers whose execution was finally ordered at the Politburo on 5 March 1940. In April–May 1940, 26,000 officers were executed by Laverinty Beria&#x27;s NKVD (many by Blokhin) in the Katyn Massacre.

When Germany invaded the USSR during June 1941, Kulik was given command of the 54th Army on the Leningrad front. Here he presided over Soviet defeats that resulted in the city of Leningrad being surrounded and General Zhukov being rushed to the front in order to stabilize the defenses and take over Kulik&#x27;s command.

Zhukov states Kulik &quot;was relieved of his command, and the Stavka placed the 54th Army under the Leningrad Front&quot; on 29 September 1941. On June 22, the Defense Industries and the Artillery Directorate were transferred away from Kulik to a 32-year-old factory director, Dmitriy Ustinov. During March 1942 Kulik was court-martialed and demoted to the rank of Major-General. His status as one of Stalin&#x27;s cronies saved him from the firing squad that was the fate of other defeated Soviet generals. During April 1943 he became commander of the 4th Guards Army. From 1944 to 1945 he was Deputy Head of the Directory of Mobilization, and deputy commander of the Volga Military District.

==Downfall and death==
After a respite during and immediately after the war, Stalin and his police chief Lavrentiy Beria began a new round of military purges due to Stalin&#x27;s jealousy [citation needed] and suspicion of the generals&#x27; public standing. Kulik was dismissed from his posts during 1946 after NKVD telephone eavesdroppers overheard him grumbling that politicians were stealing the credit from the generals. Arrested during 1947, he remained in prison until 1950, when he was condemned to death and executed for treason.

<text>Cadence Recordings, formerly MapleMusic Recordings, is a Canadian independent record label founded by Andy Maize, Jeff Maize, Mike Alkier, Evan Hu, Lorique Mindel and Grant Dexter in 1999 and based in Toronto, Ontario. Other investors include Gary Slaight, Michael Burke and Universal Music. In 2016, its parent Company Maple Core changed its name to Cadence Music Group, and as a result, MapleMusic was renamed as Cadence Recordings.

== History ==
The MapleMusic Recordings label is a project of Andy Maize from Canadian roots rock band Skydiggers and Maple CEO Grant Dexter. Other artists who have released albums on MapleMusic include Carly Rae Jepsen, David Usher, Colin James, Boy, The Dears, Danny Michel, Jason Bajada, Martha Wainwright, Pilot Speed (formerly known as Pilate), Gordon Downie, Joel Plaskett, Spirit of the West, Ridley Bent, Kinnie Starr, Cookie Duster and the Hugh Dillon Redemption Choir.

MapleMusic released three Radiohead albums &quot;In Rainbows&quot;, &quot;The King of Limbs&quot; and &quot;TKOL RMX 1234567&quot; in Canada, along with ATO in the US and XL in the UK.

Singer-songwriter Sam Roberts has transformed from a struggling independent musician to a Canadian rock musician practically overnight by his 2001 MapleMusic Recordings debut, &quot;The Inhuman Condition&quot;, and Kathleen Edwards, whose album &quot;Failer&quot; made her a critical favourite in 2003.

MapleMusic Recordings&#x27; brick and mortar business is distributed and marketed in Canada by Universal Music Canada.

In 2015, Iain M.Taylor became CEO of MapleMusic.

In March 2016, the label announced it had changed its name to Cadence Recordings after MapleCore was renamed as Cadence Music Group.

<doc id="613557" wikidata="Q858320" url="?curid=613557" title="Calculus of constructions">
<text>In mathematical logic and computer science, the calculus of constructions (CoC) is a type theory created by Thierry Coquand. It can serve as both a typed programming language and as constructive foundation for mathematics. For this second reason, the CoC and its variants have been the basis for Coq and other proof assistants.

Some of its variants include the calculus of inductive constructions (which adds inductive types), the calculus of (co)inductive constructions (which adds coinduction), and the predicative calculus of inductive constructions (which removes some impredicativity).

==General traits==
The CoC is a higher-order typed lambda calculus, initially developed by Thierry Coquand. It is well known for being at the top of Barendregt&#x27;s lambda cube. It is possible within CoC to define functions from terms to terms, as well as terms to types, types to types, and types to terms.

The CoC is strongly normalizing, and hence consistent.

== Usage ==

The CoC has been developed alongside the Coq proof assistant. As features were added (or possible liabilities removed) to the theory, they became available in Coq.

Variants of the CoC are used in other proof assistants, such as Matita and Lean.

==The basics of the calculus of constructions==

The calculus of constructions can be considered an extension of the Curry–Howard isomorphism. The Curry–Howard isomorphism associates a term in the simply typed lambda calculus with each natural-deduction proof in intuitionistic propositional logic. The calculus of constructions extends this isomorphism to proofs in the full intuitionistic predicate calculus, which includes proofs of quantified statements (which we will also call &quot;propositions&quot;).

===Terms===

A &quot;term&quot; in the calculus of constructions is constructed using the following rules:

* formula_1 is a term (also called &quot;type&quot;);
* formula_2 is a term (also called &quot;prop&quot;, the type of all propositions);
* Variables (formula_3) are terms;
* If formula_4 and formula_5 are terms, then so is formula_6;
* If formula_4 and formula_5 are terms and formula_9 is a variable, then the following are also terms:
** formula_10,
** formula_11.

In other words, the term syntax, in Backus–Naur form, is then:
:formula_12

The calculus of constructions has five kinds of objects:
# &quot;proofs&quot;, which are terms whose types are &quot;propositions&quot;;
# &quot;propositions&quot;, which are also known as &quot;small types&quot;;
# &quot;predicates&quot;, which are functions that return propositions;
# &quot;large types&quot;, which are the types of predicates (formula_2 is an example of a large type);
# formula_1 itself, which is the type of large types.

=== β-equivalence ===

As with the untyped lambda calculus, the calculus of constructions uses a basic notion of equivalence of terms, known as formula_15-equivalence. This captures the meaning of formula_16-abstraction:

* formula_17

formula_15-equivalence is a congruence relation for the calculus of constructions, in the sense that

* If formula_19 and formula_20, then formula_21.

===Judgments===

The calculus of constructions allows proving typing judgments:

:formula_22,

which can be read as the implication

: If variables formula_23 have, respectively, types formula_24, then term formula_25 has type formula_5.

The valid judgments for the calculus of constructions are derivable from a set of inference rules. In the following, we use formula_27 to mean a sequence of type assignments 
formula_28; formula_29 to mean terms; and formula_30 to mean either formula_2 or formula_1. We shall write formula_33 to mean the result of substituting the term formula_34 for the free variable formula_9 in the term formula_5.

An inference rule is written in the form

:formula_37,

which means

: if formula_38 is a valid judgment, then so is formula_39.

===Inference rules for the calculus of constructions===

1. formula_40

2. formula_40

3. formula_42

4. formula_43

5. formula_44

6. formula_45

===Defining logical operators===

The calculus of constructions has very few basic operators: the only logical operator for forming propositions is formula_46. However, this one operator is sufficient to define all the other logical operators:

: formula_47

===Defining data types===

The basic data types used in computer science can be defined within the calculus of constructions:

; Booleans : formula_48
; Naturals : formula_49
; Product formula_50 : formula_51
; Disjoint union formula_52 : formula_53

Note that Booleans and Naturals are defined in the same way as in Church encoding. However, additional problems arise from propositional extensionality and proof irrelevance.

<text>Broadcast Operations Group is an Australian media company, operating radio stations across various centres across regional New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. Branded as the Super Radio Network, stations carry one of two formats – a news talk and classic hits format based at 2SM Sydney; and a hot adult contemporary format based at New FM Newcastle.

In June 2019, the Group acquired 2BS and B-Rock FM in Bathurst from local proprietors Ron and Stephanie Camplin. 2BS immediately replaced its broadcast of &quot;The Ray Hadley Morning Show&quot; with &quot;The John Laws Show&quot;, syndicated from 2SM.

On 19 July 2024, founder and owner Bill Caralis died as a result of a heart attack at the age of 81. 

In December 2024, the company expanded again, taking over the stations of Coastal Broadcasters in Far North Queensland.

==Controversy==
===Senate Inquiry===
The BOG was cited in several instances during a Senate Inquiry into Regional Radio. There had been concerns raised as to loss of localism due to networking of radio stations. Bill Caralis was asked to appear several times at various hearings around the country, but never attended.

===Local Content===
In October 2009, Broadcast Operations Group was named by the ABC&#x27;s Media Watch program for failing to provide sufficient local content as stipulated by ACMA licence conditions. Media Watch identified three stations; 2HC Coffs Harbour, 2EL Orange and Radio 531 Port Macquarie, which all took the Grant Goldman breakfast show feed out of 2SM in Sydney and failed to meet local content conditions. In response to enquiries by Media Watch, Caralis stated that he believed local news, weather and community announcements played during the Grant Goldman program was sufficient to meet ACMA&#x27;s licence conditions. As a result, ACMA launched an investigation into the matter. As of November 2009, this investigation was ongoing, however, as of 30 November 2009, the three aforementioned stations commenced broadcasting a three-hour locally produced program from 12 pm weekdays.

===Underpayment of staff===
Broadcast Operations Group has often been accused of a reluctance to pay experienced staff to cut operating costs.

In September 2009, Broadcast Operations Group was found to have underpaid a journalist and has been ordered to make a $10,000 back payment. The journalist, who was studying communications at a Gold Coast university, worked part-time over a two-year period in the newsroom for Tweed Heads radio station Radio 97 was graded as a cadet. The Fair Work Ombudsman found that the Journalist was performing tasks that would normally be given to a Grade 1, Band 1 journalist under the Commercial Radio Journalists Award.

<doc id="613559" wikidata="Q7486" url="?curid=613559" title="Emperor Huizong of Song">
<text>Emperor Huizong of Song (7 June 1082 – 4 June 1135), personal name Zhao Ji, was the eighth emperor of the Song dynasty of China and the penultimate emperor of the Northern Song dynasty. He was also a very well-known painter, poet and calligrapher. Born as the 11th son of Emperor Shenzong, he ascended the throne in 1100 upon the death of his elder brother and predecessor, Emperor Zhezong, because Emperor Zhezong&#x27;s only son died prematurely. He lived in luxury, sophistication and art in the first half of his life. In 1126, when the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty invaded the Song dynasty during the Jin–Song Wars, Emperor Huizong abdicated and passed on his throne to his eldest son, Zhao Huan while Huizong assumed the honorary title of &quot;Taishang Huang&quot; (or &quot;Retired Emperor&quot;). The following year, the Song capital, Bianjing, was conquered by Jin forces in an event historically known as the Jingkang Incident. Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong and the rest of their family were taken captive by the Jurchens and brought back to the Jin capital, Huining Prefecture in 1128. The Emperor Taizong of Jin, gave the former Emperor Huizong a title, Duke Hunde (literally &quot;Besotted Duke&quot;), to humiliate him. After Zhao Gou, the only surviving son of Huizong to avoid capture by the Jin, declared himself as the dynasty&#x27;s tenth emperor as Emperor Gaozong, the Jurchens used Huizong, Qinzong, and other imperial family members to put pressure on Gaozong and his court to surrender. Emperor Huizong died in Wuguocheng after spending about nine years in captivity. He, along with his successors, were blamed for the Song dynasty&#x27;s decline.

Despite his incompetence in administration, Emperor Huizong was known for his promotion of Taoism and talents in poetry, painting, calligraphy and music. He sponsored numerous artists at his imperial court, and the catalogue of his collection listed over 6,000 known paintings.

==Biography==
Emperor Huizong, besides his partaking in state affairs that favoured the reformist party that supported Wang Anshi&#x27;s New Policies, was a cultured leader who spent much of his time admiring the arts. He was a collector of paintings, calligraphy, and antiques of previous dynasties, building huge collections of each for his amusement. He wrote poems of his own, was known as an avid painter, created his own calligraphy style, had interests in architecture and garden design, and even wrote treatises on medicine and Taoism. He assembled an entourage of painters that were first pre-screened in an examination to enter as official artists of the imperial court, and made reforms to court music. Like many learned men of his age, he was quite a polymath personality, and is even considered to be one of the greatest Chinese artists of all time. He constantly proclaimed legitimacy through cultural, religious, and artistic means. In 1106, he had artisans recast of the symbolic Nine Tripod Cauldrons to assert his authority. However, his reign would be forever scarred by the decisions made (by counsel he received) on handling foreign policies, as the end of his reign marked a period of disaster for the Song Empire.

===Taxation===
According to historian Chen Fuliang (1137-1203), during the Xuanhe period of Emperor Huizong, various educational and other taxes were merged into the &quot;jingzhi tax&quot;. In the Shaoxing period, over twenty taxes were combined into the &quot;zongzhi tax&quot;, including real estate and other specific taxes. Various taxes were allocated for monthly spending. In installments, the government reduced grain costs, required loans repaid in cash, increased marketplace taxes, and provided bureaucratic payments. Officials continued Xuanhe period taxes after his reign and benefited from the &quot;zongzhi tax&quot; for military spending.

===Jurchen Invasion===
When the Jurchens founded the Jin Dynasty and attacked the Liao dynasty to the north of the Song, the Song dynasty allied with the Jin Dynasty and attacked the Liao from the south in 1122. Led by Tong Guan, the Song army marched to the Song-Liao border and was stopped by the defensive forest that the Song had maintained since the reign of Emperor Taizu. In order to pass through, Tong Guan ordered the soldiers to clear the forest and continued the expedition into the Liao. This expedition succeeded in destroying the Liao, a longtime enemy of the Song. However, when the Jin attacked the Song a few years later, the Jin troops marched through a defenseless border and quickly gathered around the Song capital Kaifeng.

=== Abdication ===
However, an even more formidable Jin dynasty enemy was now on the northern border. Not content with the annexation of the Liao domain, and perceiving the weakness of the Song army, the Jurchens soon declared war on their former ally, and by the beginning of 1126, the troops of the Jin &quot;Western Vice-Marshal&quot; Wolibu crossed the Yellow River and came in sight of Bianjing, the capital of the Song Empire. Realizing his mistakes, Huizong took the blame for everything that went wrong and was stricken with panic, Emperor Huizong intended to flee but was convinced by his officials to abdicate first and then flee. Huizong then feigned a stroke because Huizong in his words said that &quot;I must use the excuse of illness. I am afraid of disorder breaking out.&quot; He then abdicated on 18 January 1126 in favour of his eldest son, Zhao Huan who is historically now known as Emperor Qinzong ().

However, Qinzong sternly refused the throne, even pushing the robes off. Huizong, still feigning a stroke, wrote with his left hand &quot;If you do not accept, you are unfilial.&quot; Qinzong said, &quot;If I accept, then I am unfilial.&quot; Even when Huizong summoned his empress, Qinzong still declined until Huizong ordered his eunuchs to forcibly put him on the throne. Qinzong finally gave in eventually accepting the throne. Huizong then departed the capital to flee in the countryside.

== Capture ==

Overcoming the walls of Bianjing was a difficult undertaking for the Jurchen cavalry, and this, together with fierce resistance from some Song officials who had not totally lost their nerve, as Emperor Huizong had, and Qinzong giving a town, resulted in the Jurchens lifting the siege of Bianjing and returning north. The Song Empire, however, had to sign a humiliating treaty with the Jin Empire, agreeing to pay a colossal war indemnity and to give a tribute to the Jurchens every year. From 1126 until 1138, refugees from the Song Empire migrated south towards the Yangtze River. Huizong returned from the countryside and resumed his normal activities after hearing that the siege was lifted although he was effectively under house arrest by Qinzong.

But even such humiliating terms could not save the Song dynasty. Within a matter of months, the troops of both Jurchen vice-marshals, Wolibu and Nianhan, were back south again, and this time they were determined to overcome the walls of Bianjing after Qinzong wanted to form an Anti-Jin alliance with two Liao nobles who were actually on the Jurchens side. After a bitter siege, the Jurchens eventually entered Bianjing on 9 January 1127, and many days of looting, rapes, and massacre followed. Most of the entire imperial court and harem were captured by the Jurchens in an event known historically as the Jingkang Incident, and transported north, mostly to the Jin capital of Shangjing (in present-day Harbin). After Qinzong was captured, Emperor Huizong was persuaded to turn himself in, however they captured Huizong. When Huizong got to see Qinzong, they cried and hugged each other with Huizong stating &quot;If you had listened to the old man, we would have avoided this disaster.&quot;

One of the many sons of Emperor Huizong, Zhao Gou was not present in Bianjing where he went to Southern China where, after many years of struggle, he would establish the Southern Song Dynasty, of which he was the first ruler, Emperor Gaozong.

Emperors Huizong and the former Emperor Qinzong were demoted to the rank of commoners by the Jurchens on 20 March 1127. Then on 10 May 1127, Emperor Huizong was deported to Heilongjiang, where he spent the last eight years of his life as a captive. In 1128, in a humiliating episode, the two former Song Emperors had to venerate the Jin ancestors at their shrine in Shangjing, wearing mourning dress. The Jurchen ruler, Emperor Taizong, granted the two former Song emperors degrading titles to humiliate them: Emperor Huizong was called &quot;Duke Hunde&quot; (; literally &quot;Besotted Duke&quot;) while Emperor Qinzong was called &quot;Marquis Chonghun&quot; (; literally &quot;Doubly Besotted Marquis&quot;).

The Song male Chinese princes who were captured were given Khitan women to marry from the Liao dynasty palace by the Jin Jurchens, who had also defeated and conquered the Khitan. The original Chinese wives of the Song princes were abducted and the Song princes then married Khitan royal women. One of the Song Emperor Huizong&#x27;s sons was given a Khitan consort from the Liao palace and another one of his sons was given a Khitan princess by the Jin at the Jin Supreme capital. The Jin Jurchens continued to give new wives to the captured Song royals, the grandsons and sons of Song Emperor Huizong after they took away their original Chinese wives. The Jin Jurchens told the Chinese Song royals that they were fortunate because the Liao Khitan royals were being treated much worse by the Jurchen than the Song Chinese royals. Jurchen soldiers were given the children of the Liao Khitan Tianzuo Emperor as gifts while the Song Emperor was allowed to keep his children while he was in captivity.

In 1137, the Jin Empire formally notified the Southern Song Empire about the death of the former Emperor Huizong. Emperor Huizong, who had lived in opulence and art for the first half of his life, died a broken man in faraway northern Heilongjiang in June 1135, at the age of 52.

A few years later (1141), as the peace negotiations leading up to the Treaty of Shaoxing between the Jin and the Song empires were proceeding, the Jin Empire posthumously honored the former Emperor Huizong with the neutral-sounding title of &quot;Prince of Tianshui Commandery&quot; (), after a commandery Tianshui in the upper reaches of the Wei River, which is the traditional Junwang (郡望, zh) of the surname Zhao.

==Art, calligraphy, music, and culture==

Emperor Huizong was a great painter, poet, and calligrapher. He was also a player of the &quot;guqin&quot; (as exemplified by his famous painting 聽琴圖 &quot;Listening to the Qin&quot;); he also had a &quot;Wanqin Tang&quot; (萬琴堂; &quot;10,000 Qin Hall&quot;) in his palace.

The emperor took huge efforts to search for art masters. He established the &quot;Hanlin Huayuan&quot; (翰林畫院; &quot;Hanlin imperial painting house&quot;) where top painters around China shared their best works.

The primary subjects of his paintings are birds and flowers. Among his works is &quot;Five-Colored Parakeet on Blossoming Apricot Tree&quot;. He also recopied Zhang Xuan&#x27;s painting &quot;Court Ladies Preparing Newly Woven Silk&quot;, and Emperor Huizong&#x27;s reproduction is the only copy of that painting that survives today.

Emperor Huizong invented the &quot;Slender Gold&quot; () style of calligraphy. The name &quot;Slender Gold&quot; came from the fact that the emperor&#x27;s writing resembled the way gold filaments twisted and turned, also inspired by Li Yu who called his calligraphy &quot;Golden Inlaid Dagger&quot; (金錯刀). Some theories posits his technique probably based on calligraphy works by Chu Suiliang, Xue Ji or Huang Tingjian.

One of the emperor&#x27;s era names, Xuanhe, is also used to describe a style of mounting paintings in scroll format. In this style, black borders are added between some of the silk planes.

In 1114, following a request from the Goryeo ruler Yejong, Emperor Huizong sent to the palace in the Goryeo capital at Gaeseong a set of musical instruments to be used for royal banquet music. Two years later, in 1116, he sent another, even larger gift of musical instruments (numbering 428 in total) to the Goryeo court, this time &quot;yayue&quot; instruments, beginning that nation&#x27;s tradition of &quot;aak&quot;.

Emperor Huizong was also a great tea enthusiast. He wrote the &quot;Treatise on Tea&quot;, the most detailed and masterful description of the Song sophisticated style of tea ceremony.

Zhao Mengfu was a famous descendant of Emperor Huizong through his daughter Zhao Jinluo.

==Legacy==
The painter Zeng Fanzhi regards &quot;Listening to the Qin&quot; as &quot;the most beautiful painting from the Song dynasty. For more than 10 years, I&#x27;ve been observing the beauty of the pine tree in that painting.&quot;

<text>Ezra Sims (January 16, 1928 in Birmingham, Alabama — January 30, 2015 in Boston, Massachusetts) was one of the pioneers in the field of microtonal composition. He invented a system of notation that was adopted by many microtonal composers after him, including Joseph Maneri.

His professional debut (12 note ET music) occurred on a Composers Forum program in New York, 1959. In 1960, compelled by his ear, he began writing microtonal music, and continued to do so for the rest of his life, with the occasional exception being taped music for dancers. His last composition in quarter tones (his sixth microtonal one) was his &quot;Third Quartet&quot; (1962). Since 1971, whatever music he has composed that is not purely electronic has employed a system of asymmetrical modes of 18 pitches per octave, drawn from a 72-note division of the octave.

 I seem finally to have identified and made transcribable what my ear was after all along: a set of pitches ordered in an asymmetrical scale of 18 (or 19) notes, some of them acoustically more important than others, transposable through a chromatic of 72 pitches in the octave. (1978)
He has received a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Koussevitsky commission, and an American Academy of Arts &amp; Letters Award, as well as numerous commissions from organizations like the Arizona Friends of Chamber Music and private individuals. He was a co-founder of the Dinosaur Annex Music Ensemble, with Rodney Lister and Scott Wheeler, for which he served as president from 1977 to 1981 and as a member of the Board of Directors from 1981 to 2003.

He has lectured on his music in the US and abroad, most notably at the Hamburger Musikgespräch, 1994; the second Naturton Symposium in Heidelberg, 1992; and the 3rd and 4th Symposium, Mikrotöne und Ekmelische Musik, at the Hochschüle für Musik und Darstellende Kunst Mozarteum, Salzburg, in 1989 &amp; 1991. In 1992–93, he was guest lecturer in the Richter Herf Institut für Musikalische Grundlagenforschung in the Mozarteum.

He has published articles on his technique in &quot;Computer Music Journal&quot;, &quot;Mikrotöne III&quot;, &quot;Mikrotöne IV&quot;, &quot;Perspectives of New Music&quot;, and &quot;Ex Tempore&quot;. With the American cellist Theodore Mook, he designed a font, now widely adopted, for use with computer printing programs, based on his set of accidentals, which are sufficient for 72-note music. His music is published by Frog Peak Music and Diapason Press (Corpus Microtonale).

As his award citation from the American Academy of Arts and Letters attests:

Ezra Sims has already contributed an outstanding body of works, many of which have explored with singular imagination, conviction and success the beautiful but elusive world of microtonal music.

<text>The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway was a historic Canadian transcontinental railway running from Fort William, Ontario (now Thunder Bay) to Prince Rupert, British Columbia, a Pacific coast port. East of Winnipeg the line continued as the National Transcontinental Railway (NTR), running across northern Ontario and Quebec, crossing the St. Lawrence River at Quebec City and ending at Moncton, New Brunswick. The Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) managed and operated the entire line.

Largely constructed 1907–1914, the GTPR operated 1914–1919, prior to nationalization as the Canadian National Railway (CNR). Despite poor decision-making by the various levels of government and the railway management, the GTPR established local employment opportunities, a telegraph service, and freight, passenger and mail transportation.

==Proposal==

After the ousting of Edward Watkin, the GTR declined in 1870 and 1880 to build Canada&#x27;s first transcontinental railway. Subsequently, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) transcontinental and its feeder routes operated closer to the Canada–US border. Seeking a transcontinental to open up the central latitudes, the Canadian government made overtures to the GTR and to the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR). The regional operators in Eastern and Central Canada initially declined because projected traffic volumes suggested an unlikely profitability. Realizing that expansion was essential, the GTR attempted to acquire the CNoR, rather than to collaborate on construction. The GTR finally negotiated to construct only the western section, and the federal government would build the eastern sections as the NTR. The respective legislation passed in 1903.

Nearer to Asia than Vancouver, Port Simpson was about southeast of the southern entrance to the Portland Canal, which forms part of the boundary between British Columbia and Alaska. In 1903, when friction arose in Canada over the Alaska boundary decision favouring US interests, US President Theodore Roosevelt threatened to send an occupation force to nearby territory. In response, Canadian Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier preferred a more southerly location for the terminal, which became the more easily-defendable Kaien Island (Prince Rupert).

==Construction==
===Overview===
During the official ceremony on September 11, 1905 at Fort William, Ontario, Laurier turned the first sod for the construction of the GTPR, but the actual first sod had occurred the previous month about south of Carberry, Manitoba. From Fort William, the GTPR built a section of track connecting with the NTR near Sioux Lookout. The route paralleled the CPR for west of Winnipeg before it veered northwest. That year, the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were established. The line proceeded west to Saskatoon in 1907, Edmonton in 1909, and Wolf Creek in 1910. For contractual purposes, Winnipeg to Wolf Creek (Edson, Alberta) was the Prairie Section, and Wolf Creek to the Pacific was the Mountain Section. Foley, Welch and Stewart (FW&amp;S) was selected as the prime contractor for the latter.

The GTPR followed the original Sandford Fleming &quot;Canadian Pacific Survey&quot; route from Jasper, Alberta through the Yellowhead Pass, and the track-laying machine crossed the BC/Alberta border in November 1911. In the mountain region, costs escalated to $105,000 per mile, compared with the budgeted $60,000. Following the CNoR paralleling through the Rockies, which created of duplication, the GTPR rail bed largely became redundant. The more northerly Pine Pass option, as specified in its charter, may have been a better choice in terms of developing traffic and in improving the current CNR network (especially if the later Pacific Great Eastern Railway route had opted for the Monkman Pass crossing).
To secure concessions from the BC government, eastward construction from the Pacific Coast began in 1907. The track east of Prince Rupert reached 50 miles, then 102 miles by 1910, the Bulkley Valley in 1912 and Burns Lake in 1913. The line completed across the prairies, through the Rockies, and to the newly-constructed seaport at Prince Rupert. The last spike ceremony occurred one mile east of Fort Fraser, British Columbia at Stuart (Finmoore) on April 7, 1914. A 1910 prediction had correctly claimed if a line were built from Tête Jaune Cache to Vancouver, it would effectively kill Prince Rupert and relegate its route to branch line status.

===Construction crews===
Claiming labour shortages, the GTP attempted to obtain government approval to bring in unskilled immigrants from Asia. By late 1912, 6,000 men had become employed east of Edmonton. Although contractors prohibited liquor in camps, bootlegging was rampant. FW&amp;S provided hospitals and medical services by charging employees one dollar per month. The articles for the Grand Canyon of the Fraser, Dome Creek, McGregor, Upper Fraser, and the BC communities within the :Category:Grand Trunk Pacific Railway stations, outline construction through those specific localities.

===Flat-bottomed sternwheelers===
FW&amp;S operated five steamboats to supply their camps advancing east from Prince Rupert on the Skeena River. Launched in 1908, the Distributor and Skeena remained until 1914, as did the Omineca, which was purchased in 1908. Launched in 1909, the Operator and Conveyor were disassembled in 1911, transported to Tête Jaune and relaunched in 1912 on the Fraser River. Detailed articles cover the sternwheelers Skeena, Operator, and Conveyor and their roles on the Skeena River, and on the Fraser River.

===Fraser River scows===
During the construction phase from Tête Jaune to Fort George thousands of tons of freight for railway construction and merchants travelled downstream from the railhead by scow. In 1913, when scowing on that part of the river peaked, about 1,500 men were employed as scowmen, or &quot;River Hogs,&quot; as they were generally called. In high water, the trip from Tête Jaune took five days and in low water up to 12 days because of the shallow bars. Each vessel measured about 40 feet long and 12–16 feet wide and carried 20–30 tons. Two men crewed each end. The Goat River Rapids, Grand Canyon, and Giscome Rapids, were extremely dangerous, with wrecks and drownings common. Dismantlers purchased the scows that survived the journey, selling the used lumber primarily for house building.

===Real estate development===
The funding for railway expansion depended upon returns from the sale of land acquired by the railway. The Grand Trunk Pacific Town &amp; Development Co. was responsible for locating and promoting strategic town sites. However, the priority of maximizing profit undermined the economic prosperity of communities and other businesses by hampering the increase in traffic volumes essential for the GTP’s own survival. In 1910 at Prince Rupert, although 25 real estate agents operated, David Hayes, the brother of GTP President Charles Melville Hays, was the sole company agent.

In what would become Prince George, the company purchased the First Nations reserve for a railway yard and a new town site. The GTPR also caused the displacement and the socio-economic destruction of native communities along the route, many of which had social and economic values in conflict with those of the railway.

==Steamships==
Beginning in 1910, a GTPR steamship service operated from Prince Rupert. The first ship, the SS &quot;Prince Albert&quot; (formerly the &quot;Bruno&quot; built in 1892 at Hull, England), was an 84-ton, steel-hulled vessel and travelled as far as Vancouver and Victoria. Next, the SS &quot;Prince John&quot; (formerly the &quot;Amethyst&quot; built in England in 1910), travelled to the Queen Charlotte Islands. Built in 1910, the much larger and , both 3,380-ton, 18-knot vessels, could carry 1,500 passengers with staterooms for 220. The ships operated a weekly service from Seattle to Victoria, Vancouver, Prince Rupert and Anyox.

The vision was for coastal shipping to mature into a trans-Pacific line. However, Prime Minister Robert Borden was uninterested in promoting Prince Rupert as a port of call for any shipping lines. Vancouver flourished, but Prince Rupert languished. From 1919, the Canadian Government Merchant Marine (CGMM), in partnership with CNR, promoted the development of import/export trade with Pacific rim countries. Although the expansion benefitted Vancouver, Prince Rupert remained a backwater.

==Ancillary facilities==

The GTPR built the Fort Garry Hotel in Winnipeg and the Hotel Macdonald in Edmonton. Halibird and Roche of Chicago designed the hotel for Prince George, but it never left the drawing-board stage. Construction of the $2m Chateau Prince Rupert, designed by Francis Rattenbury, did not proceed beyond the foundations, laid in 1910. Its forerunner, the temporary GTP Inn, was demolished in 1962. Sometimes in conjunction with the CNoR, the GTPR built some impressive city stations.

When built in 1910, the Grand Trunk Pacific dock in Seattle was the largest on the West Coast. On July 30, 1914, fire destroyed the facility. The federal government provided a $2m subsidy for a dry dock at Prince Rupert to handle ships up to 20,000 tons. Completed in 1915, it catered for only much smaller local vessels prior to World War II. It was dismantled in 1954 to 1955.

==Operations==
The CNoR tracklaying through the Canadian Rockies in 1913 roughly paralleled the GTPR line of 1911 and created about 100 miles of duplication. In 1917, a contingent from the Corps of Canadian Railway Troops added several crossovers to amalgamate the tracks into a single line along the preferred grade from Lobstick, Alberta, to Red Pass Junction, British Columbia. The surplus rails were lifted and the heavier-grade GTPR ones shipped to France for use during World War I.

Through the 1910s, several branches were built by the GTP under the Grand Trunk Pacific Branch Lines Company and the Grand Trunk Pacific Saskatchewan Railway Company, subsidiaries of GTP. These included branches to Prince Albert, Battleford, Calgary, and to the international border via Regina. Further branches were projected, and many were completed under Canadian National.

In 1915, unable to meet its debts, the GTP asked the federal government to take over the GTPR. The CNoR was in worse financial shape. The royal commission that considered the issue in 1916 released its findings in 1917. In March 1919, after the GTPR has defaulted on construction loans to the federal government, the federal Department of Railways and Canals effectively took control of the GTPR before it was merged into the CNR in July 1920. Noting numerous construction blunders, the 1921 arbitration on worth also ranked its significance within the naïve railway schemes of that era by this observation: &quot;It would be difficult to imagine a more misconceived project.&quot; The GTP itself was nationalized in 1922.

==Current status== 
Today, the majority of the GTPR is still in use as CN&#x27;s (name change to Canadian National or acronym &quot;CN&quot; in 1960) main line from Winnipeg to Jasper. The former CNoR line, and a later connection to Tête Jaune Cache, merge north of Valemount, before continuing south to Vancouver. The former GTPR line through Tête Jaune Cache to Prince Rupert forms an important CN secondary main line. The GTPR&#x27;s high construction standards, and the fact Yellowhead Pass has the best gradients of any railway crossing of the Continental Divide in North America gives the CN a competitive advantage in terms of fuel efficiency and the ability to haul tonnage.

After a century languishing far behind Vancouver, the Port of Prince Rupert has grown in importance since the early 2000s. Ongoing redevelopment of terminal infrastructure, less municipal congestion than other West Coast ports, proximity to the great circle route from East Asia to North America, and a fast connection to the Midwestern United States along the former GTPR route, have reduced transportation times.

<text>South Cadbury is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of South Cadbury and Sutton Montis, in the Somerset district of the ceremonial county of Somerset, England. The parish includes the village of Sutton Montis.

It is famous as the location of the hill fort of Cadbury Castle, thought by some to be King Arthur&#x27;s Camelot.

==History==

The name Cadbury means &quot;Cada&#x27;s fort&quot; and refers to Cadbury Castle, which is immediately to the south west of the village. It is a vast Iron Age hill fort covering an area of around 20 acres (8 ha). The site has seen human occupation from Neolithic times until the late Saxon period. It was famously partially excavated by Leslie Alcock in the 1960s, when, amongst other things, an Arthurian period feasting hall was discovered. Since John Leland made reference to local traditions of a connection with King Arthur in the 16th century, there has been widespread speculation that this was the location of Camelot. King Arthur&#x27;s Well sits at the foot of the hill and the local public house, the &quot;Red Lion&quot;, was renamed &quot;The Camelot&quot; when it was remodelled in 2004.

In the Domesday Book of 1086 the manor is recorded as held by Turstin FitzRolf.

The parish was part of the hundred of Catsash.

=== Civil parish ===
On 1 April 1933 part of the parish of Sutton Montis was merged with South Cadbury, on 1 January 2015 the merged parish was renamed &quot;South Cadbury &amp; Sutton Montis&quot;. In 1931 the parish of South Cadbury (prior to the merge) had a population of 146.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

Until 2023 the village fell within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wincanton Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

It is also part of the Glastonbury and Somerton county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

==Geography==

South Cadbury is located at , 7.5 miles (12 km) north-east of Yeovil. The village lies just south of the main A303 road from London to the south-west of England, which runs through the north of the civil parish. As well as South Cadbury itself, the parish includes the village of Sutton Montis to the south of Cadbury Hill. This is one of three large hills in the centre and south-eastern portion of the parish, the others being Littleton Hill and the Beacon. There is a hill fort on Cadbury Hill and a disused quarry on Littleton Hill. South Cadbury is part of the Castle Cary ward, which elects one councillor to Somerset County Council.

==Religious sites==
The South Cadbury parish church of St Thomas à Becket is dedicated to Thomas Becket. It largely dates from the 13th and 15th centuries, but was widely restored in 1874. Many of the fittings date from this time. However, it does boast a 15th-century roof, with angel brackets and carved bosses, and an early wall painting of St Thomas. The church is a Grade II* listed building. The 18th century poet and satirist, Charles Churchill was at one time curate at South Cadbury.

Sutton Montis parish church is dedicated to the Holy Trinity. It has Saxon origins and includes surviving work of the 12th century. It is a Grade I listed building.

==Notable residents==
* Herbert Pitman (1877–1961), Merchant Navy Officer and third officer on the RMS Titanic.

<text>The year 1950 in [[science]] and technology included some significant events.

==Astronomy and space sciences==
* Dutch astronomer Jan Oort postulates the existence of an orbiting cloud of planets (the Oort cloud) at the outermost edge of the Solar System.
* Enrico Fermi discusses the Fermi paradox.

==Biology==
* Melvin Calvin, James Bassham, and Andrew Benson at the University of California, Berkeley, discover the Calvin cycle in photosynthesis.
* Entomologist Willi Hennig publishes &quot;Grundzüge einer Theorie der phylogenetischen Systematik&quot; in East Germany, pioneering the study of cladistics.
* Full-scale release of myxomatosis for control of the Australian rabbit population.

==Chemistry==
* February 9 – Californium, a radioactive actinide transuranium element, is first synthesized by Stanley G. Thompson, Kenneth Street, Jr., Albert Ghiorso and Glenn T. Seaborg at the University of California, Berkeley.

==Computer science==
* March – Publication of Claude Shannon&#x27;s paper &quot;Programming a Computer for Playing Chess&quot;, seminal in the development of computer chess and introducing the Shannon number.
* April – Publication of Richard Hamming&#x27;s paper &quot;Error detecting and error correcting codes&quot;, seminal in the construction of error detection and correction codes and from which Hamming code and the Hamming distance derive.
* August 25 – In the early history of video games, &quot;Bertie the Brain&quot; is first displayed to the public at the Canadian National Exhibition.
* October – Publication of Alan Turing&#x27;s paper &quot;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&quot;, seminal in the study of artificial intelligence and presenting the Turing test.

==Mathematics==
* John Forbes Nash, Jr. proposes the Nash equilibrium in game theory, initially in his Princeton doctoral thesis.
* The prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher at RAND and formalized and named by Albert W. Tucker.

==Medicine==
* June 17 – The first cadaveric internal kidney transplantation is performed on Ruth Tucker, a 44-year-old woman with polycystic kidney disease, at Little Company of Mary Hospital (Evergreen Park), Illinois. Although the donated kidney is rejected 10 months later because no effective immunosuppressive drugs have been developed at this time, the intervening time gives Tucker&#x27;s remaining kidney time to recover and she lives another 5 years.

<text>The Build Engine is a first-person shooter engine created by Ken Silverman, author of &quot;Ken&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot;, for 3D Realms. Like the &quot;Doom&quot; engine, the Build Engine represents its world on a two-dimensional grid using closed 2D shapes called sectors, and uses simple flat objects called sprites to populate the world geometry with objects.

The Build Engine is generally considered to be a 2.5D engine, as the basic world geometry is two-dimensional with an added height component, allowing each sector to have a different ceiling height and floor height. Some floors can be lower and some can be higher; the same is true with ceilings (in relation to each other). Floors and ceilings can hinge along one of the sector&#x27;s walls, resulting in a slope. With this information, the Build Engine renders the world in a way that looks three-dimensional, unlike modern game engines that create actual 3D environments.

Though the Build Engine achieved most of its fame from powering the 1996 first-person shooter &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, it was also used for many other games.

== Technical features ==

=== Sectors ===
Sectors are the building blocks of a level&#x27;s layout, consisting of a two-dimensional polygonal outline when viewed from above, with the top and bottom faces of the sector given separate altitudes to create a three-dimensional space. Hence, all walls are perfectly vertical—anything appearing otherwise is technically a sloped floor or ceiling. The word &quot;room&quot; can be used as a loose substitute to aid understanding, though one room in the game world can consist of many sectors, and parallaxed skies can give the illusion of being outdoors. Sectors can be manipulated in real-time; &quot;all&quot; of their attributes such as shape, height, and slope could be modified &quot;on-the-fly&quot; by games, unlike the earlier &quot;Doom&quot; engine. This allowed games to have destructible environments, such as those seen in &quot;Blood&quot;. This technique is similar to the use of push walls in the earlier Apogee Software title &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; which featured similar dynamic environments.

Developers of games based on the engine used special reserved &quot;sprites&quot; (game objects), often called &quot;sector &quot;, that, when given special tags (numbers with defined meanings), would allow the level designer to construct a dynamic world; similar tag information could be given to the sector walls and floor area to give a sector special characteristics. For example, a particular sector effector may let players fall through the floor if they walk over it and teleport them to another sector; in practice, this could be used to create the effect of falling down a hole to a bigger room or creating a body of water that could be jumped into to explore underwater. A sector could be given a tag that made it behave like an elevator or lift.

Sectors could overlap one another, provided they could not be seen at the same time (if two overlapping sectors were seen at the same time, a hall of mirrors effect resulted). This allowed the designers to create, for instance, air ducts that appeared to extend across the top of another room (however, doing so could be tricky for designers due to the 2D viewpoint used for much of the editing process). This allowed the designers to create worlds that would be physically impossible (e.g. a doorway of a small building could lead into a network of rooms larger than the building itself). While all these made the games using the engine appear to be 3D, it wouldn&#x27;t be until later first-person shooters, such as &quot;Quake&quot;, which used the &quot;Quake&quot; engine, that the engine actually stored the world geometry as true 3D information, making the creation of one area stacked atop another area in a single map very feasible.

=== Voxels ===
Later versions of Ken Silverman&#x27;s Build Engine allowed game selected art tiles to be replaced by 3D objects made of voxels. This feature appeared too late to be used in &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, but was seen in some of the later Build Engine games. &quot;Blood&quot; uses voxels for weapon and ammo pickups, power-ups, and eye-candy (such as the tombstones in the &quot;Cradle to Grave&quot; level, some chairs, and a crystal ball in &quot;Dark Carnival&quot;). &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; makes even more advanced use of the technology, with voxels that can be placed on walls (all of the game&#x27;s switches and buttons are voxels).

For several years, Ken worked on a modern engine based entirely on voxels, known as &quot;Voxlap&quot;.

=== Room over room ===
One limitation of the Build Engine is that its level geometry is only capable of representing one connection between sectors for any given wall. Due to this, a structure as simple as a shelf with space both above and below it is impossible, though sometimes sprites or voxels can be substituted. Buildings with several floors are technically possible, but it is not possible for such a building to contain an external window directly above or below another window. In addition, some liberties will need to be taken with the staircases, elevators, and other methods of access for each floor.

Several Build Engine games (namely &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot;, &quot;Blood&quot;, and &quot;Redneck Rampage&quot;) worked around this by displaying a &quot;viewport&quot; to another sector through an additional rendering pass. This technique, called &quot;room-over-room&quot; (ROR), appears seamless to the player. In addition to an expanded range of vertical construction, ROR was often used to give bodies of water translucent surfaces. ROR was never a feature of the Build Engine itself, but rather a &quot;trick&quot; that was created by game developers. A trick used in &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; to get around this, as in the case of its opaque underwater sections, was to simply transport the player quickly to another region of the map made to mimic it, similar to the elevators from &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot;.

In 2011, a feature was added to EDuke32 called &quot;true room over room&quot; (TROR), which allows multiple sectors to be stacked vertically so that each sector&#x27;s wall has its own connection, enabling vertically-unrestricted structures. The difference between ROR and TROR is that TROR sectors physically overlap in the map data and editor (allowing for easy creation and visualization), rather than being drawn from separate locations using view portals, hence &quot;true&quot; room over room. TROR is a feature of the EDuke32 source port, not a game feature or trick.

==Development==
The Build Engine was essentially a one-man project for Ken Silverman, though he consulted John Carmack for guidance early in the project. Silverman was hired by 3D Realms on the basis of his demo for Build. Though he continued to refine the engine after becoming employed at 3D Realms, according to Silverman he never teamed with any other 3D Realms employees on the project and was never directed to tailor the engine towards any particular game.

== Source release and further developments==

On June 20, 2000 (according to his website) Ken Silverman released the Build Engine source code under a proprietary non-commercial license. Silverman explained that after id Software set a precedent by releasing the source code for the Doom engine, fans had been pressuring him to release the source code for the Build Engine.

=== Early days ===
Version 2.0 of EDuke, a project to improve &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; for modders by Matt Saettler (Matteus), was sent to 3D Realms for packaging shortly after the release of the Build source, leaving Duke Nukem 3D the pre-built libraries that 3D Realms had used with the original Duke. (Both &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; and &quot;EDuke&quot; were still closed-source at this point.)

With the 2.1 private betas, Saettler worked towards integrating Silverman&#x27;s build source into the Duke source code, but the project fizzled out before producing anything more than some very buggy private betas. A few total conversion teams for Build games decided to work from Silverman&#x27;s Build code directly, and an enhanced version of the Build editor known as Mapster was also developed.

It was claimed at the time by many on the 3D Realms forums that it would be impossible to port Build to a multitasking operating system, as it needed a large contiguous block of memory that wouldn&#x27;t be available in a multitasking environment. This statement did not hold up to scrutiny, as all modern operating systems use virtual memory which allows apps to get contiguous logical memory without using contiguous physical memory, but conventional wisdom of the time was that porting Build to such an OS was unfeasible.

=== &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; source release ===
On April 1, 2003, after several years of claims to the contrary, 3D Realms released the source code to &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; under the GPL-2.0-or-later license. Not long afterwards, both Ryan C. Gordon (icculus) and Jonathon Fowler (JonoF) created and released source ports of the game, including the Build Engine. It was possible to play &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; well on the NT line of Windows (including Windows 2000/XP) and on Linux and other Unix operating systems, and interest in the source ports soared.

=== icculus.org port ===
Ryan C. Gordon (icculus), with the help of others, made the first port of the engine using SDL. The port was first to Linux, then to Cygwin, and finally to a native Windows build using the Watcom C++ compiler, which was the compiler used for the original DOS build (despite being compiled with Watcom C++, Build is plain C.) There was some talk of Matt Saettler using this to port &quot;EDuke&quot; to Windows, but nothing came of it. A port of &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; was later produced after the source was released. This was also forked by David Koenig (Rancidmeat) as Duke3d_w32 which was in turned forked into the multiplayer focused xDuke, hDuke, nDuke and rDuke.

=== JonoF port ===
A second source port was made to Windows, and later to Linux and Mac OS X, by Jonathon Fowler (JonoF). This port, JFDuke3D, initially did not have network game support, though this was added later in development. After a long period of dormancy it was put on GitHub in 2020 and received updates in 2021 and 2024. He also ported the Ken-Build test game.

==== Polymost ====
The task of updating the Build Engine to a true 3D renderer was taken on by Silverman himself. In the release notes for Polymost, he wrote: &quot;When 3D Realms released the Duke Nukem 3D source code, I thought somebody would do a OpenGL or Direct3D port. Well, after a few months passed, I saw no sign of somebody working on a true hardware-accelerated port of Build, just people saying it wasn&#x27;t possible. Eventually, I realized the only way this was going to happen was for me to do it myself.&quot;

The Polymost renderer allowed for 3D hardware-accelerated graphics using OpenGL. It also introduced &quot;hightile&quot;, a feature that made it possible to replace the game&#x27;s original textures with high-resolution replacements in a variety of formats. Polymost has been utilized in Jonathon Fowler&#x27;s JFBuild, JFDuke3D, JFShadowWarrior, and source ports derived from their code bases.

=== EDuke32 ===
A month after the game code, the source for EDuke 2.0 was also released, followed by the source for the last private beta of &quot;EDuke&quot; 2.1 (which never made it to a release version). Richard Gobeille (TerminX) merged the EDuke 2.0 source with JFDuke3D to make &quot;EDuke32&quot;. Another port, &quot;Wineduke&quot;, based on the icculus code, has since died off, leaving EDuke32 the only EDuke port still in development.

EDuke32 also supports the games &quot;NAM&quot; and &quot;WWII GI&quot;, as EDuke was based on the code to those games.

==== Polymer ====
On April 1, 2009, an OpenGL shader model 3.0 renderer was revealed to have been developed for EDuke32, named &quot;Polymer&quot; to distinguish from Ken Silverman&#x27;s &quot;Polymost&quot;. At first it was thought to be an April Fools&#x27; joke, but the renderer was later made public. It allows for more modern effects such as real-time dynamic colored lighting and shadow mapping, specular and normal mapping, and other shader-based features in addition to most of the features added to Polymost over the years. Although Polymer is completely usable, it is technically incomplete and unoptimised, and is still in development. The developers of EDuke32 have stated that once Polymer has been rewritten for speed, it will supplant Polymost completely, as it is a superior renderer, and can be made to look identical to Polymost.

=== Other game ports ===
The &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; source code was released on April 1, 2005 under the GPL-2.0-or-later license, and JonoF released a source port of it, JFShadowWarrior, on April 2, 2005. However, he admitted that he had access to the &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; source code about a week before its release. The port was left in a partially incomplete state, before being put on GitHub in 2020 and receiving updates in 2021 and 2024. The earlier version was later forked by Ben Smit (ProASM) for the SWP port. An icculus port of &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot; was started, but remained alpha. A VoidSW port by the &quot;Ion Fury&quot; and EDuke32 developers entered public beta on May 21, 2020. A fork from an earlier version, called IcedSW, by Justin Marshall (IceColdDuke) also exists.

The &quot;Transfusion&quot; project aimed to re-create &quot;Blood&quot; in the DarkPlaces engine, but as of 2007, this project was far from complete, though it has playable deathmatch multiplayer; a similar project is &quot;BloodCM&quot; which recreates all of the Monolith made single player levels for &quot;Blood&quot; on top of EDuke32, as well as &quot;ZBlood&quot; which ports some &quot;Blood&quot; assets and levels onto ZDoom. The &quot;eRampage&quot; project attempted to create a total conversion of &quot;Redneck Rampage&quot; for EDuke32. Meanwhile &quot;DN3DooM&quot;, &quot;Shadow Warrior TC&quot;, &quot;Doomed Redneck&quot;, &quot;Re-Blood&quot;, &quot;Re-PowerSlave&quot;, &quot;VietDoom&quot;, and &quot;Fatedoom&quot; adapts those games onto GZDoom.

The source code of &quot;Witchaven&quot;, &quot;Witchaven II: Blood Vengeance&quot;, &quot;William Shatner&#x27;s TekWar&quot;, and &quot;Corridor 8: Galactic Wars&quot; also surfaced in 2007 from developer Les Bird. The legal status of these, however, is unclear, though the derived EGwhaven patches for &quot;Witchaven&quot; were included in the game&#x27;s Steam and GOG.com re-releases. JonoF released ports for &quot;Witchaven&quot; and &quot;TekWar&quot; on March 3, 2024; with derived ETekWar and EWitchaven ports also prototyped. The full source code for various alpha versions of &quot;Blood&quot; have also leaked over time.

This was then used as a reference for an otherwise reverse engineered port to Java using LibGDX called BloodGDX in May 2017 by Alexander Makarov (M210), the previous author of &quot;BloodCM&quot;. This followed from the author&#x27;s previous port of &quot;TekWar&quot; released in January 2016, and has been followed up by ports for &quot;Witchaven&quot;, &quot;Redneck Rampage&quot;, &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;, &quot;PowerSlave&quot;, &quot;Legends of the Seven Paladins&quot; and &quot;Shadow Warrior&quot;, now all collectively called BuildGDX. DukeGDX also supports the files from the &quot;20th Anniversary World Tour&quot; edition of &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;.

A further port of &quot;Blood&quot;, called NBlood, was released in January 2019 by Alexey Khokholov (Nuke.YKT) based on EDuke32, and the creator&#x27;s previous Rednukem port for &quot;Redneck Rampage&quot; (which also supports &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; and &quot;Duke Nukem 64&quot;). An EDuke32 port for &quot;PowerSlave&quot;, called &quot;PCExhumed&quot;, was released on November 21, 2019 by Barry Duncan (sirlemonhead) with help from Nuke.YKT. The source port Raze forks various Build engine ports, including JFDuke3D, SWP, NBlood, Rednukem, and PCExhumed, and ties it to a new underlying backend based on the developers&#x27; own GZDoom. NBlood and PCExhumed have also been backported to JFBuild for the purpose of adapting it to platforms such as the Amiga, PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS.

== Successor ==
After multiple attempts to design a successor to Build, Silverman again began experimenting with such an idea in 2006. He used this work - now called Build 2 - while teaching 3D game programming to children at a summer camp from 2007 until 2009, and work continued until 2011 when he lost interest in the project. It features a more advanced lighting system, voxel rendering for entities and true room-over-room 3D spaces, and at least in part retained backwards compatibility with the original Build. Silverman released his drafts to the public on March 7, 2018. The source code was published under a proprietary non-commercial license on June 8, 2019.

<text>Kathleen Margaret Edwards (born July 11, 1978) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and musician. Her 2002 debut album, &quot;Failer&quot;, contained the singles &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and &quot;Hockey Skates&quot;. Her next two albums – &quot;Back to Me&quot; and &quot;Asking for Flowers&quot; – both made the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 list and reached the top 10 of Billboard&#x27;s Top Heatseekers chart. In 2012, Edwards&#x27; fourth studio album, &quot;Voyageur&quot;, became Edwards&#x27; first album to crack the top 100 and top 40 in the U.S., peaking at #39 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and #2 in Canada. In 2012, Edwards&#x27; song &quot;A Soft Place To Land&quot; won the SOCAN Songwriting Prize, an annual competition that honours the best song written and released by &#x27;emerging&#x27; songwriters over the past year, as voted by the public. Her musical sound has been compared to Suzanne Vega meets Neil Young.

== Early life ==
Edwards, the daughter of a diplomat, spent portions of her youth in Korea and Switzerland. Her father is Leonard Edwards, former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. At age 5, Edwards began classical violin studies that continued for the next 12 years. As a teenager she lived overseas, where she spent much of her time listening to her brother&#x27;s records of Neil Young and Bob Dylan. Her brother also bought her her first record, a Tom Petty album. After high school she decided not to attend post-secondary education, instead opting to play local clubs to pay the bills.

==Music career==
In 1999, Edwards recorded a six-song EP entitled &quot;Building 55&quot; and pressed 500 copies. By the fall of 2000, she was on tour across Canada managing her own gigs. In 2001, she wrote seven of the ten songs for her 2002 debut release &quot;Failer&quot;.

Edwards played at SXSW in 2002 and was signed to Rounder Records and MapleMusic shortly after. &quot;Failer&quot; was released in Canada in the fall of 2002 on MapleMusic Recordings. In January 2003 &quot;Failer&quot; was released by Rounder Records in the US and internationally. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; declared her one of year&#x27;s most promising new acts and &quot;Blender&quot; said that &quot;Failer&quot; songs possessed &quot;an indefinable pull that makes you love the characters they describe, no matter how fucked up they are.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Edwards as a writer whose songs can &quot;pare situations down to a few dozen words while they push country-rock towards its primal impulses of thump and twang.&quot; She made her television network debut on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; where she performed &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News.&quot;

In 2005, Edwards released &quot;Back to Me&quot;, which also garnered considerable critical acclaim, and led to the release of the singles &quot;Back to Me&quot; and &quot;In State&quot;. The track &quot;Summerlong&quot; was also featured on the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Elizabethtown&quot; starring Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst. 

In 2008, Edwards released her third studio album, &quot;Asking for Flowers&quot;. It was described by the &quot;San Francisco Bay Guardian&quot; as &quot;her finest album to date&quot;, and was a shortlisted nominee for the 2008 Polaris Music Prize. In contrast with 2005&#x27;s &quot;Back to Me&quot;, on which Edwards relied on her working band, &quot;Asking for Flowers&quot; predominantly features session musicians.

In fall 2010, Edwards began working on her fourth studio album in Wisconsin. &quot;Voyageur&quot; was released in January 2012. It includes the single &quot;Change the Sheets,&quot; and was co-produced by Justin Vernon of Bon Iver.

She appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on January 17, 2012, singing &quot;Change the Sheets&quot; from her new album &quot;Voyageur&quot;.

In November 2019, Edwards released &quot;It&#x27;s Christmastime (Let&#x27;s Just Survive)&quot;, her first new single since &quot;Voyageur&quot;, on the Dualtone Records compilation album &quot;A Dualtone Christmas&quot;.

In May 2020, Edwards released the single &quot;Options Open&quot; and announced &quot;Total Freedom&quot;, her first new album in eight years. The album was released on August 14, 2020.

==Musical collaborations==
In 2005, Edwards lent her vocals to the duet &quot;The Plan&quot;, recorded with Matt Mays and El Torpedo for their self-titled album. In 2006, she was nominated for Juno Awards for Songwriter of the Year and Adult Alternative Album of the Year for &quot;Back to Me&quot;. In 2007, Edwards worked with John Doe, of the punk rock band X, on his solo album &quot;A Year in the Wilderness&quot;. She sings on three tracks.

In 2008 Edwards sang backup vocals on Bryan Adams&#x27; album &quot;11&quot;, and supported one of his tours. In 2009, she joined Adams on stage to sing one of Adams&#x27; songs, &quot;Walk on By&quot;.
In 2011 Edwards contributed vocals on Arkells&#x27; song &quot;Agent Zero&quot;, off their second album &quot;Michigan Left&quot;. &quot;Soft Place to Land&quot;, one of two songs on Edwards&#x27; &quot;Voyageur&quot; album co-written with The Long Winters frontman John Roderick, won the 2012 SOCAN Echo Songwriting Prize.

She co-wrote the song &quot;Good Woman&quot;, from Maren Morris&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;Girl&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2004, Edwards married guitarist and collaborator Colin Cripps. They divorced in 2011. Edwards was later in a relationship with Justin Vernon, Wisconsin-born singer/songwriter and front-man of the band Bon Iver. Edwards and Vernon separated in 2012. In 2020, Edwards married property developer Sean McAdam. The couple now make their home in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Edwards stepped back from the music scene in 2014, launching a coffee house in Stittsville called Quitters along with Rick Tremblay (who was her manager when she worked in a downtown Starbucks in the 1990s). She insisted that she is not leaving music but just taking a break, and that the name Quitters is &quot;kind of tongue-in-cheek&quot;. Quitters closed on March 6, 2022 after Edwards sold the business, so that she could return to her music career.

As of 2018, Edwards continued to perform sporadically, including a number of new songs. In August 2019, following the suicide of American singer-songwriter Neal Casal, Edwards opened up on Twitter about the struggle with depression that led her to take time away from her music career.

<doc id="613574" wikidata="Q902583" url="?curid=613574" title="UNIT">
<text>UNIT is a fictional military organisation from the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and its spin-off series &quot;Torchwood&quot; and &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;. Operating under the auspices of the United Nations and initially led by Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, its purpose is to investigate and combat paranormal and extraterrestrial threats to Earth. Several UNIT personnel (such as the Brigadier, Sergeant Benton and Mike Yates) played a major role in the original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series, and it was a regular feature from &quot;The Invasion&quot; (1968) until &quot;The Seeds of Doom&quot; (1976).

Originally referred to as the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, it was revealed in 2005 that the real-life UN was no longer happy being associated with the fictional organisation and UNIT&#x27;s full name could now no longer be used (the &quot;UNIT&quot; and &quot;UN&quot; abbreviations could be used as long as it was not explained what the letters stood for). The organisation was renamed to the Unified Intelligence Taskforce in 2008, with the name first being used in the episode &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot;. Despite the series now distancing itself from the real-life UN, dialogue in the episode, and several since, indicates that the in-world fictional version of the United Nations still supports UNIT.

== Creation ==
In a 2014 interview, former script editor Terrance Dicks recalled that he was present at the &quot;birth&quot; of UNIT during the production of the 1968 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Invasion.&quot; He credited writer and script editor Derrick Sherwin and producer Peter Bryant as having come up with the idea beforehand, saying that they were testing the concept in &quot;The Invasion&quot; before it had become central to the show in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; (1970). In a series of interviews originally recorded for the 2006 DVD of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Inferno&quot; (1970), actor Nicholas Courtney, who played Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart in &quot;The Invasion&quot;, similarly described &quot;The Invasion&quot; as a &quot;dummy run&quot; for the idea of the Doctor, the main protagonist of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, being exiled to Earth. Dicks also said that the idea of exiling the Doctor was done because making every serial take place on Earth was cheaper to produce than if every serial had to have a new alien planet built, and that UNIT was an idea Sherwin had come up with to answer the question of what to do with the Doctor after he was exiled to Earth. Speaking in an interview on the 2012 DVD of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Krotons&quot; (1968–69), Sherwin said that he wanted &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to be &quot;down on Earth anyway, for credibility&quot;, and described UNIT as &quot;the ideal vehicle&quot; for this.

In another 2014 interview in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, Sherwin recalled that after submitting his scripts for &quot;The Invasion&quot; to Bryant, which included UNIT, Sherwin, who was also working freelance as a script editor, was told by Bryant to introduce his UNIT idea earlier, as it could &quot;take some of the weight off [the] shoulders&quot; of actor Patrick Troughton, who played the Doctor. Speaking in an interview on the 2011 special-edition DVD of &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;, Sherwin said that he had created UNIT because he wanted to give some &quot;considerable support&quot; to the Doctor, &quot;so that [Troughton] didn&#x27;t have so many damn lines to learn each week&quot;.

Sherwin said in 2014 that while working as script editor on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; (1968), which involved British Army characters, he told scriptwriters Mervyn Haisman and Henry Lincoln to include all of the characters that he had originally invented for &quot;The Invasion&quot;. Sherwin was uncertain if the army forces featured in &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; appeared as UNIT, but was &quot;convinced&quot; that, as a teaser for UNIT&#x27;s more substantial role in &quot;The Invasion&quot;, &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; was supposed to have replaced the basic army forces that were seen in the story. Sherwin asserted that he held the copyright on Lethbridge-Stewart, as he &quot;created him in &quot;The Invasion&quot;&quot;. In an interview recorded for the 2006 DVD release of &quot;Inferno&quot;, Sherwin described &quot;The Invasion&quot; as the start of UNIT and the beginning of the Doctor &quot;coming down to Earth&quot;. Production notes in &quot;Doctor Who: The Complete History&quot; credit Haisman and Lincoln as the owners of Lethbridge-Stewart, who was the army commander from &quot;The Web of Fear&quot;, and mention how Bryant and director Douglas Camfield were negotiating the use of the character for &quot;The Invasion&quot; from Haisman and Lincoln in May 1968, subsequent to &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; being broadcast in February and March. &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; is also described in the notes as being a &quot;major influence on &quot;The Invasion&quot;&quot;.

==Fictional history==

The roots of UNIT in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; universe lie in the Second Doctor serial &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; (1968), following which the organisation is named and established in &quot;The Invasion&quot; (1968). According to &quot;Survivors of the Flux&quot; (2021), UNIT was founded in 1958 and built over the subsequent decade, with Lethbridge-Stewart joining the taskforce after it failed to act on the events of the First Doctor story &quot;The War Machines&quot; (1966).

Following &quot;The Invasion&quot;, the contribution of scientific advice in battling extraterrestrial threats is recognised and both Dr Elizabeth Shaw and the exiled Third Doctor joins UNIT just in time to help defeat the Autons in &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; (1970).

UNIT continued to feature in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; after &quot;Spearhead&quot;, but when the Third Doctor&#x27;s exile is lifted in &quot;The Three Doctors&quot; (1972–73), his association with UNIT becomes more sporadic, especially after his regeneration into his fourth incarnation at the end of &quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot; (1974). Although the last appearance of UNIT in the series for many years was in &quot;The Seeds of Doom&quot; (1976), the organisation continued to execute its mandate to investigate and combat alien activity. The final appearance of UNIT during the original run of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was the Seventh Doctor serial &quot;Battlefield&quot; (1989).

UNIT is mentioned by both its acronym and full name in the 2005 series episodes &quot;Aliens of London&quot; and &quot;World War Three&quot;, where it sent a delegation to a gathering of experts at 10 Downing Street. UNIT appeared again the same year in &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;. In addition to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, UNIT has also featured in the spin-off series &quot;Torchwood&quot; and &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;.

From &quot;The Power of Three&quot; (2012), the first on screen appearance of UNIT in any Whoniverse media since the two-part &quot;Doctor Who&quot; special &quot;The End of Time&quot; in 2009–2010, UNIT has been shown to have been reorganised by Kate Stewart, the Brigadier&#x27;s daughter.

In the 2019 New Year special &quot;Resolution&quot;, the Thirteenth Doctor attempts to call on Kate Stewart for assistance, but discovers UNIT operations have been suspended and replaced with an outsourced call centre, due to a diplomatic argument over funding.

In the 2020 New Year&#x27;s Day episode, &quot;Spyfall, Part 1&quot;, it is stated that UNIT and Torchwood no longer exist. The 2021 episode &quot;Survivors of the Flux&quot; reveals it to be caused by Grand Serpent, a political figure who assumed the identity of Prentis and was instrumental in UNIT&#x27;s formation, to facilitate the Sontarans’ invasion of Earth during the Flux crisis. UNIT is resurrected in the 2022 BBC Centenary special &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;, once again under the leadership of Kate Stewart with a new building in London which is demolished by the end of the episode to defeat the Cybermen.

By the time of the 2023 60th anniversary specials UNIT has relocated to a new headquarters in a skyscraper in the City of London, while remaining under the leadership of Kate Stewart.

==Organisation==
UNIT&#x27;s status is supported by enabling legislation that allows it to assume emergency powers when necessary. Although it operates under the authority of the United Nations, its members are seconded from the host country&#x27;s military and are still bound to obey that chain of command. Within the UK section of UNIT, ranks are those of the British Army: Lethbridge-Stewart is a Brigadier, Yates is a Captain, a Major appears in &quot;The Seeds of Doom&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot; (2005), and a Colonel and Captain appear in &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot;/&quot;The Poison Sky&quot; (2008). UNIT personnel are seconded from the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force, and are still bound by the UK chain of command. Major Blake reports to the Prime Minister in &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;. UNIT is able to call on the conventional military branches for support, and in &quot;The Seeds of Doom&quot; gets the RAF to provide precision air-strikes. Due to the international nature of the organisation, it is sometimes viewed with suspicion by local military and national security agencies, who feel that it might impinge on their sovereignty. UNIT&#x27;s existence is known to the public, but mainly as a security organisation with scientific expertise; its actual agenda is classified. Although the Brigadier originally states that UNIT do not arrest people, as of the 21st century, UNIT has the authority to detain persons indefinitely without trial, appeal, outside contact or legal representation, as experienced by Toshiko Sato before she was recruited to work for the British government by the Torchwood Institute in a flashback in the &quot;Torchwood&quot; episode &quot;Fragments&quot; (2008). The organisation was rearranged by Kate Stewart, the daughter of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. In &quot;The Power of Three&quot; (2012), Kate heads UNIT&#x27;s scientific research department, which now has authority over the military branch.

===Equipment===
The British troops of UNIT have been armed with standard British Army weapons such as the L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle, Sterling submachine gun, and Browning Hi-Power pistol, and they have worn 58 pattern webbing. They are also shown using heavy weaponry such as bazookas, machine guns, mortars and, in &quot;Terror of the Zygons&quot; (1975), a depth charge launcher. For &quot;Battlefield&quot; (1989), they have the Steyr AUG assault rifle while the Brigadier still uses a Webley Revolver. In the 2000s, they use Heckler &amp; Koch G36C carbine, the M4 carbine (with different scopes used such as ACOG and holographic weapon sights, as well as equipping CQB receivers for indoor use), SIG P226 pistols, and for heavy duty, use Stinger missile launchers. In &quot;The Power of Three&quot;, they are further equipped with PASGT helmets, goggles, and riot armour for their shins.

UNIT&#x27;s personnel have a wide range of weaponry to call on, some custom-made to combat specific threats. Among these are special ammunition described by the Brigadier in &quot;Battlefield&quot; as armour-piercing rounds with a solid core and Teflon coating which &quot;could go through a Dalek&quot;. Other munitions include explosive rounds for Yetis, other armour-piercing rounds for robots, and gold-tipped rounds for use against the Cybermen (as well as silver bullets as suggested by the Doctor), and rad-steel coated bullets to neutralise Sontaran anti-bullet fields that target copper.

In &quot;The Invasion&quot; (1968), UNIT has a command centre established in the cargo hold of a Lockheed Hercules military transport aircraft. &quot;The Dæmons&quot; (1971) features the UNIT Mobile HQ, a large bus-like vehicle that could be driven to the site of an incident. A mobile command centre is also shown in &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot; and &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;, where it is depicted as a black articulated lorry with UNIT insignia.

UNIT employs unarmed helicopters for transport. It is also shown using a tank in &quot;Robot&quot; (1974–75). In &quot;Planet of the Dead&quot; (2009), it uses trucks with SAM launchers.

In &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;, UNIT is shown to have translation software which can decipher alien languages with great accuracy. The software, or at least the results from the translation, can be loaded on a hand-held device.

In &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;, UNIT is shown to be able to command and co-ordinate the world&#x27;s combined nuclear arsenal for strategic strikes on orbiting alien craft.

In &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot; (2007), the flying aircraft carrier the &quot;Valiant&quot; is introduced. The &quot;Valiant&quot; is also shown (in &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;) to be equipped with a scaled down version of the Torchwood Institute weapon that destroyed the Sycorax ship in &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;.

It is mentioned in &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; story &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot; (2010) that UNIT has a Moonbase.

In &quot;The Power of Three&quot;, UNIT is shown to have a scientific research department with a large laboratory in the base beneath the Tower of London. During the story, the laboratory is dedicated to studying cubes that appeared out of nowhere. Kate Stewart, daughter of the Brigadier and head of the scientific research department, has a handheld device that can scan a body (picking up the Eleventh Doctor&#x27;s twin hearts), and also serves as a communication device. The computers at UNIT HQ can detect anomalies such as artron energy spikes, and can also access CCTV on the streets. There is also mention of them using helicopters and tanks while testing the destructibility of the cubes.

&quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013) shows that the Tower of London base contains the Black Archive housing various alien technological devices that UNIT has salvaged over the years and kept hidden away. Protected by various alien defences that erase the memories of visitors to ensure that they cannot reveal what is inside the Archive, the Archive is also &#x27;TARDIS-proof&#x27;, and has been used by UNIT as a means of assessing the Doctor&#x27;s companions to confirm whether they can be trusted. UNIT is also shown to at least have access to the Under-Gallery, a secret gallery containing works of art dating back to the Elizabethan era that Elizabeth I ordered locked away as they were too dangerous for the public.

===Uniform===

Across the eras, UNIT have been identified with different styles of uniform.

For &quot;The Invasion&quot;, Privates and Corporals wore No.7 dress, while ranks of Sergeant and above wore uniforms based on No.4 dress, but lacking buttons and with the jacket – which appears to be fastened by velcro – tucked into the trousers. All UNIT members wore oval patches with &#x27;U.N.I.T&#x27; embroidered on them on their left sleeves and NCOs wore their badges of rank on their right sleeves. Sand/Beige coloured berets, similar to those worn by the Special Air Service with the black UNIT logo on a round white background as a cap badge were worn by all ranks. For UNIT&#x27;s next appearance, &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; (1970), the No.4s became uniform for all ranks, except for two radar operators seen in the opening who wear No.7s; the female officer wearing a tie with a UNIT logo printed on. The No.4 style of uniform stayed throughout &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot; (1970).

Christine Rawlins had a new futuristic-looking design produced for &quot;The Ambassadors of Death&quot; (1970), which features only in this story. All ranks are given khaki-coloured zip-up jackets without lapels, which are worn over tan rolled-neck sweaters. The Brigadier retained his No.4 uniform.

For &quot;Inferno&quot; (1970), these changed to Denison smock camouflage uniforms. From &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot;, producer Barry Letts decided to have UNIT wearing 1960 pattern fatigues, as well as appropriate contemporary British Army or RAF uniform, such as service dress and barrack dress. The UNIT patches and tan berets remain standard, although personnel are also seen in British Army peaked caps with regulation cap badges.

In &quot;Terror of the Zygons&quot;, they wear DPM camouflage jackets and tactical black cap badges. &quot;The Android Invasion&quot; (1975) sees them wearing barrack dress, which they also wear for their brief appearance in &quot;The Seeds of Doom&quot; (1976).

UNIT then had a lengthy absence from the screen. They made a small cameo appearance in &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983), which sees Colonel Crichton wearing service dress and a Sergeant in barrack dress, both with the oval patches on their uniform. Captain Yates returns in the serial also wearing service dress but with no markings.

For their full return in &quot;Battlefield&quot;, their look was completely updated. Their appearance in this serial is close to the real-world United Nations Peacekeeping troop outfits. UNIT are represented by a nuclear missile convoy wearing UN issued blue berets and DPM camouflage. They have a new UNIT insignia patch of a winged globe, which is worn the upper sleeves and beret. There is also a Czech engineer team wearing Czech camouflage with the same UN issued blue beret as the convoy. The Brigadier returns, wearing at different times service dress, barrack dress, and DPM while wearing a cap rather than beret.

After the series was cancelled and recommissioned, UNIT first had a minor appearance in the episode &quot;Aliens of London&quot; (2005). In this episode, UNIT were represented by four high-ranking US military officers, wearing Army Service Uniform with real UN peacekeeper patches on the sleeves, and Navy Service Uniform. Only the female officers wore headwear, the Army officer a garrison cap, the Navy officer a white female variation combination cap.

UNIT&#x27;s first major appearance in the new series was in &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot; in 2005. Here, a new insignia has been designed based on the &quot;Battlefield&quot; version. The troopers wear black uniforms consisting of police clothing/SAS Counter Revolutionary Warfare (CRW) Wing overalls and a red Royal Military Police beret, and equipment. Insignia is a small silver-metal UNIT parawings on a red beret and a large UNIT Parawing patch worn over the left breast pocket on the utility vest or fatigues. Commanding officers wear No. 2 service dress with UNIT insignia. Variations include Captain Magambo from &quot;Turn Left&quot; (2008) wearing a black version of service dress with a red beret, and Colonel Karim in &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; story &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot; wearing black civilian clothes with UNIT insignia and rank epaulettes.
UNIT returns in the series 7 episode &quot;The Power of Three&quot;. Their uniforms in this series are an alteration of the uniforms seen since 2005. They no longer wear ID cards on the right breast pocket, and appear to lack the logos on the arms. They wear PASGT helmets with black covering and black goggles in place of berets. They also wear riot armour for their forearms and shins, and plain black brassards on the left arm. The scientific research department that now serves as the head of UNIT consists of plainclothes civilians.

The series 8 episode &quot;Death in Heaven&quot; introduces an officer uniform, consisting of black or navy-blue jacket and trousers, white shirt and black tie, with medal ribbons and rank epaulettes, inspired by (but not identical to) officers&#x27; No. 2 service dress, sans the gloves, peaked cap and Sam Browne shoulder belt.

===Prominent members of UNIT===
The Doctor, the main protagonist of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, is a member of UNIT. In &quot;Aliens of London&quot;, after reading up about the Doctor during his twelve-month absence, Mickey Smith tells Rose Tyler that the Ninth Doctor knows UNIT because &quot;he&#x27;s worked for them&quot;. In &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot;, Colonel Mace tells the Tenth Doctor, &quot;Technically speaking, you&#x27;re still on staff.&quot; In &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, the Eleventh Doctor tells Clara Oswald that he works for UNIT and that UNIT is his &quot;job&quot;. In &quot;Death in Heaven&quot; (2014), Kate Stewart describes the Twelfth Doctor as &quot;technically&quot; still &quot;on the payroll&quot;, as he never resigned.

Prominent members of the British contingent of UNIT include Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, Sergeant Benton, Captain Yates, UNIT operative Jo Grant and later, Surgeon-Lieutenant Harry Sullivan, RN. After leaving the Doctor, Martha Jones joins UNIT. In &quot;The Claws of Axos&quot; (1971), an American agent named Bill Filer was sent from Washington to assist in the hunt for the Master. Kate Stewart, the Brigadier&#x27;s daughter, becomes Head of Scientific Research and Chief Scientific Officer, and then Commander in Chief of UNIT, and appears in multiple episodes beginning with &quot;The Power of Three&quot; in 2012.

===Republican Security Forces===

The 1970 serial &quot;Inferno&quot; sees the Third Doctor visit a parallel universe. In this reality, Great Britain is a fascist republic, where the Royal Family was executed for treason in 1943, as depicted in the novel &quot;I, Alastair&quot;; the novel also shows that this universe&#x27;s leader of Britain was an associate of Oswald Mosley, and eventually became leader of the country following the downfall of the old order, with his picture being visible in the Brigade Leader&#x27;s office in &quot;Inferno&quot;. The parallel version of the British contingent of UNIT is an SS-like state paramilitary organisation known as the Republican Security Forces (RSF), manning their version of the drilling project as a &quot;scientific labour camp&quot;.

They are armed with a mixture of Soviet and German weapons, such as the SKS rifle and the Walther P38 pistol. Their rank system uses titles based loosely on that of the British Union of Fascists: Sergeant Benton is Platoon Under Leader Benton, Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart is Brigade Leader Lethbridge-Stewart, and Elizabeth Shaw, a soldier rather than a scientist in their dimension, has the rank of Section Leader (which appears to be an officer rank). Their uniforms consist of contemporary US Army olive green military fatigues for Other Ranks, tan uniforms with black rank slides on the shoulders (based on the brown shirts) for officers, and black garrison caps with white piping and an RSF cap-badge as head-dress for both. The organisation has full authority to interrogate, court-martial, and formally execute prisoners as they see fit under the &quot;Defence of the Republic Act, 1943&quot;.

By the end of the story, most of the members of the RSF are killed when a volcanic cataclysm engulfed Great Britain and left much of their world devastated.

== Main characters ==
* The Doctor has been UNIT&#x27;s principal scientific advisor since their third incarnation was exiled to Earth (having previously collaborated with UNIT during their second incarnation). The Doctor departed from UNIT&#x27;s full-time employment during their fourth incarnation, leaving a space-time telegraph (and, later, the TARDIS&#x27;s telephone number) with which they could be summoned in emergencies. They retain their credentials, still bearing their third incarnation&#x27;s portrait; and, initially, UNIT personnel Surgeon-Lieutenant Harry Sullivan and Sarah Jane Smith as their companions. Despite the looseness of their UNIT affiliation and their frequent disagreements with the organization, The Doctor continues to consider UNIT&#x27;s scientific advisor to be their job, even into their thirteenth incarnation.
* Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart (later Sir Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart) is a founder of UNIT and the original commander of its British contingent. During the Third Doctor&#x27;s exile on Earth, he hires the Doctor as his scientific advisor. He was the father of Kate Lethbridge-Stewart, another UNIT commander.
* Sergeant Benton first appears as Corporal Benton in &quot;The Invasion&quot; and becomes a regular fixture of UNIT stories from &quot;The Ambassadors of Death&quot; until &quot;The Android Invasion&quot;. In his final three appearances, during the Fourth Doctor era, he has been promoted to regimental sergeant major.
* Liz Shaw, originally drafted from the University of Cambridge as UNIT&#x27;s scientific advisor, first appears in &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; and accepts the position of the Third Doctor&#x27;s assistant when he takes the job of scientific advisor.
* Jo Grant is a civilian employee of UNIT who was assigned as assistant to the Third Doctor, replacing Liz Shaw. The character appears from the serial &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot; in 1971 until &quot;The Green Death&quot; in 1973. According to the novelisation of &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot;, she holds the rank of Corporal.
* Mike Yates also makes his first appearance in &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot; and appears regularly throughout the Third Doctor era.
* Sarah Jane Smith is an investigative journalist who becomes a UNIT associate by way of her companion relationship with the Third, Fourth, Tenth and Eleventh Doctors. Sarah Jane maintains contact with, and receives support from, senior UNIT personnel throughout her lifetime.
* Harry Sullivan, a Surgeon-Lieutenant in the Royal Navy, is a medical officer in UNIT at the time of the Doctor&#x27;s third regeneration and becomes his companion for several adventures.
* Petronella Osgood, played by Ingrid Oliver, is a UNIT scientist and assistant to Kate Stewart in &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013). She wears a long, knitted scarf of many colours, reminiscent of the Fourth Doctor&#x27;s scarf, and suffers from a respiratory ailment for which she uses an inhaler when over-excited. In &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, she comes to be impersonated by a Zygon, and the two get along rather well. Following a peace treaty between humans and Zygons, which resulted in 20 million Zygons settling on earth disguised as humans, the Zygon duplicate remains in the form of Osgood, with neither version of Osgood revealing to others which is which. One version of Osgood works with Kate Stewart and the Twelfth Doctor, in the episode &quot;Death in Heaven&quot; (2014), wearing a bow tie reminiscent of the Eleventh Doctor and Converse reminiscent of the Tenth Doctor. She is shown to be eager to please the Doctor and admires him. The Doctor hints that he might consider making her a companion, but she is disintegrated by Missy. Osgood displayed a great deal of self-control as she near-calmly tried persuading Missy to spare her with logical explanations. In &quot;The Zygon Invasion&quot; (2015), the surviving Osgood is kidnapped by a splinter group of Zygons led by Bonnie, who seeks war with the humans. After being rescued by the Doctor, she travels with him to UNIT Black Archive in an attempt to keep the peace while refusing to tell him whether she is human or Zygon. In &quot;The Zygon Inversion&quot;, the Doctor, after successfully convincing Bonnie to live peacefully with humanity, offers Osgood a trip in the TARDIS. Osgood refuses, revealing Bonnie has become her new duplicate.
* Martha Jones, codename &quot;Greyhound 6&quot;, becomes a medical doctor after her adventures with the Doctor, and subsequently a Medical Officer for UNIT. She contacts the Doctor so he could help UNIT in the episode &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot; (2008). She becomes trusted enough in UNIT to be given the Osterhagen Key, part of a mechanism for a program to destroy Earth.
* Kate Lethbridge-Stewart, also known as Kate Stewart, is the Commander in Chief of UNIT; formerly the Chief Scientific Officer and &quot;de facto&quot; leader of UNIT&#x27;s UK contingent in the 2010s and 2020s. She first appears in &quot;The Power of Three&quot; (2012), introduced by Chris Chibnall, before returning in the fiftieth anniversary special &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013) and subsequently recurring during the Twelfth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Doctor&#x27;s eras. Kate is the daughter of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. The character was created for the unofficial spin-off videos &quot;Downtime&quot; (1995) and &quot;Dæmos Rising&quot; (2004), in which she was played by Beverley Cressman. She is depicted as a single mother to Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, who to date has not been referred to in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, although Kate has referred to herself as a divorcee and &quot;mother-of-two&quot; in the programme.
* Tegan Jovanka is a former airhostess and former companion to the Fourth and Fifth Doctors, she was hired to work as a freelancer for UNIT and employee by Kate Stewart before The Power of the Doctor. She met the Thirteenth and assisted her by blowing up the Cybermen and the new UNIT base and saw a hologram of an aged Fifth Doctor.
*Ace, who was a former companion to the Seventh, was a 16-year-old when she first met the Doctor. She was hired to work as a freelancer for UNIT and employed by Kate Stewart before &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;. She met the Thirteenth and assisted her by destroying the Daleks plan with her baseball bat and using her Nitro-9 with the assist of Graham O&#x27;Brien and saw a hologram of an aged Seventh Doctor.
* Shirley Anne Bingham is the 56th and current scientific adviser to UNIT who made her first appearance in The Star Beast where she was in charge of investigating the seemingly crashed ship of the Meep. She also assisted UNIT and the Fourteenth Doctor in investigating the eponymous Giggle in the Giggle.
* Melanie Bush, a computer programmer and former companion to the Sixth and Seventh Doctors, she was hired to work as a computer scientist for UNIT by Kate Stewart sometime after 2022&#x27;s The Power of the Doctor. She was present for the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Doctors&#x27; battle against the Toymaker at UNIT Tower in 2023.
* Colonel Christofer Ibrahim is a UNIT field officer who answers directly to Kate Stewart and follows her without question. He made his debut in The Giggle, bringing the Doctor and Donna to his boss, and was present for the Toymaker&#x27;s defeat.
* Morris Gibbons is a thirteen-year-old boy genius and scientific advisor who appears in the series 14 two-part finale &quot;The Legend of Ruby Sunday&quot; / &quot;Empire of Death&quot;.

=== Other media ===
==== Originating in audio ====
* Colonel Vikram Shindi is a field officer in the &quot;UNIT: The New Series&quot; audio plays, an old-school, humourless soldier who follows Kate Stewart without question.
* Captain Josh Carter is a company officer in &quot;UNIT: The New Series&quot;, more of a man of action.
* Lieutenant Sam Bishop is a company officer in &quot;UNIT: The New Series&quot;, and serves as a troubleshooter.
* Lieutenant Jimmy Tan is a company officer introduced later in &quot;UNIT: The New Series&quot;.

==== Originating in TV but expanded in other media ====
* Allison Williams is the assistant and scientific advisor to Professor Rachel Jensen when UNIT existed as the Incursion Countermeasures Group. She originated in &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; but was fleshed out in the &quot;Countermeasures&quot; audio series.

==Other appearances==
UNIT has also been featured in many &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-offs. Different spin-offs have made varying attempts to be consistent with other stories.

===Stage play===
In 1984, a stage comedy titled &quot;Recall UNIT: The Great T-Bag Mystery&quot; was produced, written by Richard Franklin (Captain Yates) who reprised his character in the play. The cast also included John Levene as Benton, and the play was performed between 20 and 24 August as part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Due to other commitments, Nicholas Courtney was unable to appear as the Brigadier, but pre-recorded a telephone message from Lethbridge-Stewart which was written into the plot.

===Novels===
The novelisation of &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot; (1990) by Ben Aaronovitch mentions that the troops that Gilmore commands were from the &quot;Intrusion Counter-Measures Group&quot;. &quot;UNIT Exposed&quot;, the 1991 &quot;Doctor Who Magazine Winter Special&quot;, suggests that the ICMG is a forerunner of UNIT.

Both Virgin Publishing&#x27;s Missing Adventures and BBC Books&#x27; Past Doctor Adventures have set stories in the UNIT era and have revealed new information about UNIT&#x27;s past, present and future. The novel &quot;Business Unusual&quot; sees the Sixth Doctor assist UNIT in an investigation involving the now-retired Brigadier being held prisoner by the agents of the Nestene Consciousness, while &quot;Deep Blue&quot; sees the Fifth Doctor interact with the Third Doctor&#x27;s UNIT colleagues at a time when his past self was away. &quot;Bullet Times&quot; pits the Seventh Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith against a branch of UNIT known as the &#x27;Cortez Project&#x27;, who consider &quot;any&quot; alien activity on Earth to be dangerous even if said aliens have no hostile intent, forcing the Doctor to discreetly work with a Chinese triad to help a crashed alien ship repair itself and depart.

&quot;No Future&quot; (1994) by Paul Cornell featured an intelligence section of UNIT in an alternate 1970s called Broadsword. Broadsword agents wore plain clothes and were &quot;hand-picked to offer us lateral and non-military solutions, backed up by SAS training and sheer common sense&quot;.

The 1996 New Adventures novel &quot;Just War&quot; by Lance Parkin mentions &quot;LONGBOW&quot;, a world security organisation set up by the League of Nations that encountered the occasional extraterrestrial incident but was disbanded after it and the League failed to prevent World War II.

The standalone 1996 Virgin novel &quot;Who Killed Kennedy&quot; by David Bishop, which provides a fictional history of UNIT from an investigative journalist&#x27;s perspective, reveals Lethbridge-Stewart&#x27;s role in proposing the formation of UNIT after the Yeti incident.

By the 26th century, UNIT has transformed into a secret society called the Unitatus, pledged to defend the Earth against alien threats, first seen in Parkin&#x27;s &quot;Cold Fusion&quot; (1996).

&quot;The Dying Days&quot; (1997), also by Parkin, names the French division of UNIT as NUIT (Nations Unies Intelligence Taskforce).

The Unitatus lasts at least until the 30th century, according to &quot;So Vile a Sin&quot; (1997) by Ben Aaronovitch and Kate Orman.

&quot;The Devil Goblins from Neptune&quot; (1997) by Keith Topping and Martin Day introduced a division within the Central Intelligence Agency headed by a man known only as Control, which has featured as a rival to UNIT in subsequent novels &quot;The King of Terror&quot; and &quot;Escape Velocity&quot;, &quot;King&quot; seeing the Fifth Doctor working with the Brigadier on an investigation in 1999 that forces them to work with the CIA and Control, and &quot;Escape&quot; depicting Control trying to deal with a new alien presence on Earth before UNIT discover it, only for the threat to be thwarted by the amnesic Eighth Doctor. &quot;Alien Bodies&quot; (1997) by Lawrence Miles introduced a more ruthless UN division called UNISYC (United Nations Intelligence Security Yard Corps), which by the 2040s has replaced UNIT.

&quot;The Face of the Enemy&quot; (1998) by David A. McIntee has the British branch of UNIT facing a menace without the Third Doctor to help them, as he and Jo Grant are elsewhere (and elsewhen) experiencing the television serial &quot;The Curse of Peladon&quot;.

The Southeast Asian contingent of UNIT is identified in McIntee&#x27;s &quot;Bullet Time&quot; (2001) as UNIT-SEA.

The 2003 Eighth Doctor Adventure &quot;Emotional Chemistry&quot; by Simon A. Forward names the Russian division of UNIT ОГРОН (OGRON) (Оперативная Группа Разведки Объединённых Наций, or, Operativnaya Gruppa Razvedki Obyedinyonnih Natsiy, which roughly translates as &quot;United Nations Reconnaissance Operations Group&quot;).

===Comic strips===
One story in the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; comic strip, &quot;Final Genesis&quot; (DWM #203–206), is set in a parallel universe in which humanity has made peace with the Silurians, and UNIT has become the United Races Intelligence Command.

The Eighth Doctor comic strip &quot;The Flood&quot; (DWM #346–353) establishes that the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) views UNIT with some degree of contempt in the early 21st century, and deliberately does not inform them when it detects a Cyberman incursion due to this and other unspecified problems with the United Kingdom&#x27;s relationship with the United Nations.

The Tenth Doctor comic strip &quot;The Age of Ice&quot; (DWM #408–411) is set in UNIT&#x27;s Australian base beneath Sydney Harbour. The Eleventh Doctor strip &quot;The Golden Ones&quot; (DWM #425–428) introduces UNIT Japan.

UNIT has also appeared in cameo roles in unrelated comics. In issue No. 218 of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, a character identified as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart is seen briefly from behind, addressing a Sergeant-Major Benton who is loading an unconscious Juggernaut into a lorry; 2000 AD&#x27;s &quot;Caballistics, Inc.&quot; strip has Lethbridge-Stewart (referred to solely by rank) appearing in several adventures as a military liaison and referring to &quot;The Web of Fear&quot;; and &quot;Hip Flask&quot; has a 22nd-century UNIT tied into the origins of the Elephantmen. Marvel Comics also has two major characters called Dr Alistaire Stuart (who has claimed to know &quot;a chap from Gallifrey&quot;) and Brigadier Alysande Stuart, Scientific Advisor and commander, respectively, of Britain&#x27;s Weird Happenings Organisation (W.H.O.) taskforce. 

The Titan Comics Ninth Doctor series includes a storyline where the Ninth Doctor, Rose Tyler and Captain Jack Harkness work with UNIT in the mid-1970s when rival anti-alien organization &#x27;Avalon Defence&#x27; try to undermine UNIT&#x27;s reputation so that they can take over in exchange for financial benefits. The storyline concludes with UNIT nurse Tara Misha joining the TARDIS crew after she sacrifices her own reputation to expose Avalon&#x27;s deceptions.

===Audio plays===
An alternate universe version of UNIT and the Brigadier appear in the &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot; audio play &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; (2003), produced by Big Finish Productions. In this story, UNIT is commanded by the abrasive Colonel Brimmicombe-Wood. The story concerns a UNIT that never had the Third Doctor working for it, with many different outcomes; &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot; resulted in &quot;the Plastic Purges&quot;, Mike Yates died on a time-travel mission to destroy the Silurians, and so on.

In December 2004, Big Finish released &quot;&quot;, the first audio drama in a &quot;UNIT&quot; spin-off series, which features a retired General Sir Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart as an advisor to a new generation of officers. A preview episode (given away free with &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; No. 351, and later available as a free download on the Big Finish website), &quot;&quot;, has Lethbridge-Stewart finally breaking decades of secrecy by informing a press conference of UNIT&#x27;s true purpose as humanity&#x27;s first line of defence against the unknown (although, as it turns out, the general public believe this to be a hoax). 

The protagonists for most of this series are Colonel Emily Chaudhry, Lieutenant Will Hoffman and Colonel Robert Dalton. Hoffman and Dalton are killed in the third instalment, &quot;&quot; (2005). The fourth play, &quot;&quot; (2005), features this universe&#x27;s version of Brimmicombe-Wood, and is revealed to have been the commander of ICIS all along, and working to destroy UNIT from within. The short story &quot;The Terror of the Darkness&quot; in the collection &quot;Short Trips: A Day in the Life&quot; (2005) reveals that Chaudhry and Hoffman had previously travelled with the Sixth Doctor. Their adventures then continue in &quot;Incongruous Details&quot; in &quot;Short Trips: The Centenarian&quot; (2006) before ending in &quot;Short Trips: Defining Patterns&quot; (2008).

Following the death of Lethbridge-Stewart&#x27;s actor Nicholas Courtney in 2011, in 2015, Big Finish announced a new series of UNIT audio dramas to be released in six-month intervals beginning with &quot;&quot; in November. The series features Lethbridge-Stewart&#x27;s daughter Kate Stewart in her role as Head of Scientific Research, as established in &quot;The Power of Three&quot; (2012), and is the first time that Big Finish have been licensed elements from the 2005 revival series from BBC Worldwide.

===Direct-to-video productions===
In 1987, John Levene reprised his role as Benton for a made-for-video film entitled &quot;Wartime&quot;. Produced by Reeltime Pictures, this was the first independently made &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off film. In 1997, the film was revised with voice-over dialogue provided by Nicholas Courtney in character as Lethbridge-Stewart. The Brigadier himself got a made-for-video film, &quot;Downtime&quot;, which also sees appearances from UNIT and a corrupt UNIT officer named Captain Cavendish.

BBV have made a trilogy of UNIT videos involving the Autons, although they feature none of the original members, with the main character being Lockwood (a codename for the otherwise nameless UNIT Operative 8954B)—an investigator with psychic powers. The trilogy introduced one of UNIT&#x27;s facilities (the Warehouse) for containing the remains of alien technology; the Containment Team responsible for these facilities and preventing alien outbreaks at them; and the Internal Security Division.

===Other media===
In the internet Flash animation &quot;Scream of the Shalka&quot;, Major Kennet hands the Doctor a folder with a UNIT crest on it.

For the new television series, BBC created a faux website for UNIT, complete with &quot;easter eggs&quot; that can be accessed by the reader with the passwords &quot;bison&quot; and &quot;buffalo&quot; (the latter mentioned on screen in &quot;World War Three&quot;). The &#x27;public&#x27; part of the website advertises UNIT Conferences and publications relating to &quot;extra-territorial threats&quot;, as well as press releases on the establishment of a central New York Liaison office; the press releases and publications also make reference to off-screen adventures, such as the &quot;Skaniska Incident&quot; and &quot;Jersey Tollgate Situation&quot;, with the most recent covering the events of &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot; (2005) (&quot;Alien Life Confirmed&quot;). The Secure Login link, using the password &quot;badwolf&quot; (originally &quot;bison&quot;) uncovers a &#x27;private&#x27; section which provides UNIT point-of-view reports about various events in the 2005 series, as well as mention of missions such as &quot;The Fourth Reich&quot; and &quot;Guatemala &quot;Big Locust&quot; Problem&quot;. Due to the objections by the United Nations as noted above, the letters &quot;UN&quot; are no longer expanded to &quot;United Nations&quot; on the website.

==UNIT dating==
The original 1963–1989 series presents conflicting evidence about when the stories featuring UNIT are meant to take place, and there has been much confusion and continuing fan debate on this subject. Initially the production team intended for the UNIT stories to take place in the 1980s. In the 1975 story &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot;, Sarah Jane Smith explicitly states that she is &quot;from 1980&quot;, but the 1983 story &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot; explicitly states that the Brigadier retired from UNIT in 1976 and that Warrant Officer Benton left the army in 1979.

A reference to this confusion appeared in the 2008 episode &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot;, where the Doctor was unsure if his time on the UNIT staff took place during the 1970s or the 1980s. Similarly, &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; story &quot;The Lost Boy&quot; displays a UNIT file on Sarah Jane Smith which says, &quot;The service quickly expanded, making our presence felt in a golden period that spanned the sixties, the seventies, and, some would say, the eighties.&quot; Yet another reference occurred in &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, where Kate Stewart refers to &quot;one of my father&#x27;s incident files. Codename: Cromer. Seventies or eighties depending on the dating protocol&quot;. The &quot;Cromer&quot; wording is a reference to the 1972–73-story &quot;The Three Doctors&quot; which, as well as being the first time that Doctors from different eras come together to fight a common foe was the occasion where Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, on first being transported to an alien world, likened it to the Norfolk coastal town of Cromer. Kate Stewart again refers to the confusion when she describes events from &quot;Terror of the Zygons&quot; as occurring in the &quot;&#x27;70s (or) &#x27;80s&quot; (&quot;The Zygon Invasion&quot;).

A possible justification for at least some of these dating anomalies can be found in the audio adventure &quot;The Legacy of Time: The Split Infinitive&quot;, when a temporal anomaly results in the 1960s and 1970s becoming briefly linked when a flawed time travel experiment essentially splits an individual between these eras. When the crisis concludes after the Seventh Doctor brings the two aspects together, he notes that the resulting temporal explosion will cause a range of minor anomalies to anyone in this era who has dealt with time travel, reflecting that this explains how someone who was working in the eighties could have retired in the seventies.

The episode &quot;Survivors of the Flux&quot; makes reference to the conflicting dates during a scene in which Kate Stewart accuses The Grand Serpent of deliberately tampering with evidence, photographs and dates to cover up his infiltration of UNIT.

==Critical reception==
The concept of UNIT has been generally well received by &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fans. In Andrew Cartmel&#x27;s &quot;Through Time: An Unauthorised and Unofficial History of Doctor Who&quot;, the sharp contrast between the Doctor&#x27;s eccentric personality and the seriousness and normality of UNIT is described by Cartmel as an &quot;inspired stroke&quot;.

The organisation is often seen within the context of other international organisations which featured in science fiction of the post-war era. Among others, these included SMERSH and SPECTRE from the James Bond novels, S.H.I.E.L.D. from Marvel Comics, and U.N.C.L.E. from &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;—like UNIT, intended as a fictional United Nations intelligence agency. There was even a one-season wonder telecast by NBC, in 1979, in which Robert Conrad played A Man Called Sloane who worked for a top-secret agency openly called UNIT.

<doc id="613578" wikidata="Q480289" url="?curid=613578" title="The Amtrak Wars">
<text>The Amtrak Wars is a series of novels written by British author Patrick Tilley. The series is a post-apocalyptic science fiction with some fantasy elements such as the existence of magic. Six novels and an illustrated companion guidebook were published between 1983 and 1990, with additional books planned but never completed. The books were optioned in 2007 by an Australian production company with the intent of turning them into a series of feature films.

==Backstory==
In AD 2015, the old world was destroyed in a nuclear war, known in the books variously as &#x27;The Holocaust&#x27; and &#x27;The War of a Thousand Suns&#x27;. The United States and Russia were involved in this nuclear war but who fired the first shot is not known. The resulting war lasted only a few hours, but between the nuclear exchange and the years of nuclear winter that followed, the overwhelming majority of the human race was annihilated.

The most organised band of survivors is the Amtrak Federation. Four hundred American citizens survived the nuclear war in a vast underground bunker beneath Houston, Texas. Over time, their descendants established additional underground bunker-cities (known as divisional bases) linked by a high-speed subterranean rail network. Ruled by a self-perpetuating dynasty known as the First Family, the Federation expanded slowly in numbers and territory. By AD 2989, when the novels begin, the Federation sprawls across much of the south of the United States, from Colorado and Arizona to Mississippi. It is technologically advanced, employing microlight aircraft and &#x27;wagon-trains&#x27;, massive, 600-foot-long vehicles that act as land-based aircraft carriers and mobile HQs for heavily armed infantry personnel. The Federation&#x27;s personnel are heavily susceptible to above-ground radiation and rarely live past their fortieth birthdays as a result.

Ordinary citizens of the United States who managed to survive the nuclear war and adapt to the radiation mutated into a clan-based warrior society known as the Mutes. Adopting a warrior ethos and tribal society similar to Native Americans, the Mutes are primitive, employing spears and knives in combat. Most are affected by a variety of radiation-induced infirmities, such as somewhat short-term memories and deformities varying in severity by individual. There are exceptions, Mutes with excellent recall who keep the tribe&#x27;s traditions alive through an oral tradition of story-telling. These Mutes are known as &#x27;wordsmiths&#x27;. The Mutes would not present a significant threat to the Federation&#x27;s vastly superior technology and weapons except for the existence of Mutes known as &#x27;seers&#x27;, who can foresee their moves, and &#x27;summoners&#x27;, who can use magical forces that the Federation has no defence against. The Federation leadership does not publicly acknowledge the existence of Mute magic and outlaws all discussion of its existence, to the anger of front-line combat veterans, who have seen it in action.

The third major surviving faction is known as the Iron Masters, though they refer to themselves as the Sons of Ne-Issan. According to their legends, the Iron Masters fled the destruction of their homeland of Nippon in vast floating cities that drifted into Antarctic waters and then up into the Atlantic, eventually landing on the Eastern Seaboard of the former United States. They founded a country known as the Shogunate of Ne-Issan, stretching from Nova Scotia to South Carolina and inland as far as the Great Lakes and Appalachian Mountains. The Iron Masters have developed gunpowder and great steam-powered ships, but custom, religion and political decree forbids them from developing technology based on the &#x27;Dark Light&#x27; (electricity). Due to the growing threat of the Amtrak Federation, some Iron Masters believe that without embracing the Dark Light, their nation stands little chance against the Federation&#x27;s superior technology and will be destroyed, but official policy is to maintain the edict.

==Plot summary==
In AD 2989, a 17-year-old, newly qualified Amtrak pilot named Steve Brickman joins the &quot;Lady from Louisiana&quot;, a wagon-train in its first major assault on the Plainfolk Mutes. Thanks to the Mutes&#x27; deployment of sorcery, the wagon-train is defeated and forced to retreat. Brickman is taken prisoner by the Mutes but not killed, due to a prophetic vision of the clan&#x27;s seer, Mr. Snow, which suggests Steve will be instrumental in the fulfilment of the Talisman Prophecy. The prophecy is that a &#x27;chosen one&#x27; called &quot;Talisman&quot; will arise to destroy the Federation and lead the Mutes to victorious domination of the world. Steve comes to admire and respect the Mutes; he falls in love with a &quot;straight&quot; (mutation-free) Mute woman named Clearwater and forges a bond of mutual respect with Mr. Snow&#x27;s apprentice, Cadillac.

Steve eventually escapes from the Mutes and returns to the Federation, but his account of his imprisonment and escape is deemed fantastical. Labelled a deserter, he is stripped of all rank and is publicly disgraced. Privately, Steve is recruited by the Federation&#x27;s top-secret intelligence organisation, AMEXICO, and is sent on a new assignment to capture Cadillac, Clearwater, and Mr. Snow, who are deemed of interest to the Federation. Upon learning that Cadillac has used information from Steve to build a primitive glider and fly it to Ne-Issan as part of a weapons and intelligence exchange between the Mutes and Iron Masters, Steve decides to pursue the capture mission into Ne-Issan. During this mission, Steve&#x27;s loyalties become further conflicted between his affinity with the Mutes and his birth allegiance to the Federation, and he begins a risky attempt to play both sides against the middle whilst he looks for a way to escape his enemies on both sides.

Ultimately, the Talisman prophecy is fulfilled, at great cost.

==Main characters==
*Steven Roosevelt Brickman – A wingman of The Amtrak Federation who is captured by the M&#x27;Call clan of Mutes. He gradually begins to regard them as equals, even though this goes against everything he has been taught. He falls in love with a Mute, Clearwater, and befriends Mr Snow and Cadillac. However Steve and Cadillac are constantly at odds with each other because of Clearwater, whom Steve stole from Cadillac, and their inherent distrust of each other. Steve possesses latent telepathic abilities that allow him to connect with his kin-sister, Roz, on occasion. At first this is completely unconscious, but over time he is able to contact her deliberately. It is theorised in the books that if he opened himself up he would have access to abilities similar to those displayed by Roz, though he does sometimes instinctively know what people are thinking. He also has a sixth sense for what is immediately about to happen, and is capable of matching the speed and running stamina of Mutes. He is also incredibly lucky, something which may be due to his latent telepathic abilities, his intuitive sixth sense or the fact that he was &#x27;born in the shadow of Talisman&#x27; as the Mutes believe.
*Roz – Steve&#x27;s kin-sister. She is several years younger, but the two share a deep telepathic bond. Whenever Steve is injured or under a great amount of stress her body becomes similarly affected. If Steve is shot, Roz will receive a similar wound. However this &#x27;psychosomatic wounding&#x27; vanishes within hours, leaving no trace that it was ever there. Roz is telepathic and eventually develops the ability to create extremely realistic illusions in the minds of others, indistinguishable from reality. She was studying to be a doctor, but when her telepathic link with Steve is discovered, the First Family involve her in their schemes.
*Mr Snow – The wordsmith of the Clan M&#x27;Call. He is a wise old man and a summoner of the seventh ring of power (there are nine rings of power in total). He is very wise, but also has a sharp sense of humour. He has a great affection for Steve Brickman.
*Clearwater – A super-straight with bright blue eyes. She is an excellent hand-to-hand fighter and also a summoner of the third ring. Upon seeing her Steve falls deeply in love with her, and she with him. Despite their vast cultural differences they form a relationship.
*Cadillac Deville – Also a super-straight. He is Mr Snow&#x27;s apprentice and a wordsmith and seer. Though brave, his lust for power and &#x27;standing&#x27; often lead him to do stupid or selfish things. While in Ne-Issan, land of the Iron Masters, he develops a love for sake, which only increases his less attractive personality traits and robs him of his ability to see the future in the stones until quite some time after he has stopped consuming alcohol.

==Earth Magic==

There are three types of gifted mutes, two of which possesses magical abilities. They are:

*Word-smiths – Intelligent mutes with eidetic memories. They remember the oral histories of their entire clan and are also the custodians of the Talisman prophecy. Word-smiths are highly valued, and play a leading role in their clans affairs, even more so than the clan leader.
*Seers – Able to see into the future and the past by reading &#x27;special&#x27; stones. The events they are able to view are usually connected to the place the stone has been taken from. To a seer, these stones appear to glow when they come across them. When viewing the past or future they enter a trance like state.
*Summoners – Summoners possess many magical abilities. They are able to control the weather and the earth, producing intense storms, calling down lightning and even generating earthquakes. They are also able to move objects telekinetically and influence the minds of others, either controlling them directly, or implanting hypnotic urges that the subject is compelled to follow. The summoner Clearwater also demonstrated the ability to shield herself from projectile attacks with a wall of light, identify the site and degree of any injuries a person was suffering and communicate with animals.

==Books==
#&quot;Cloud Warrior&quot; (1983)This book opens with an examination of the character of a Mute named Cadillac, and his world-view. We learn of the Talisman Prophecy, Cadillac&#x27;s status as a wordsmith and a freak, and his love of Clearwater. The story, however, is about Steven Roosevelt Brickman, an 18-year-old wingman (pilot) in the war against the Plainfolk Mutes. He is shot down, but is spared by the Mutes. He meets Cadillac, Cadillac&#x27;s mentor Mr. Snow, and Motor-Head, the tribe&#x27;s paramount warrior. He meets Clearwater, falls in love with her, and woos her away from Cadillac. He sees the gaps in his indoctrinated world-view, but still decides to escape back to the Federation, killing the jealous Motor-Head in the process. The book ends with Mr. Snow telling Cadillac and Clearwater that they will have a role to play in the Talisman Prophecy.
#&quot;First Family&quot; (1985)Steve returns to the Federation and is captured and treated as a suspected traitor. Through a series of undercover agents, the First Family manoeuvers Steve into a position of weakness and desperation, then sends him back into the field as a member of AMEXICO, the AMtrak EXecutive Intelligence COmmandoes (agents are known as &#x27;Mexicans&#x27;) with orders to kill Cadillac and Clearwater. He is promptly attacked by a group of deserters, who steal all of his equipment and throw him out. He then finds his way back to Mr. Snow, whose tribe takes him in. After hearing that Cadillac and Clearwater have gone north to the land of the mysterious &#x27;Iron Masters&#x27;, Steve stows away on an Iron Master vessel.
#&quot;Iron Master&quot; (1987)This book opens with an examination of the character of an Iron Master named Toshiro Hase-Gawa and his world-view. He is a Herald of the Inner Court, a secret agent of his Shogun. Steve discovers that Cadillac copied Steve&#x27;s technical knowledge using wordsmith magic, and is making recon gliders for the Iron Masters, masquerading as Steve (since Mutes are supposed to be illiterate). The arrival of Steve, Cadillac and Clearwater throws the internal political groups into some turmoil, and Steve receives some offers. Steve agrees to help Cadillac with the gliders, in exchange for Toshiro&#x27;s help in getting them all out of the country at the end. Toshiro then gets Steve to kill one of the seventeen &quot;daiyamo&quot; (domain-lords). They then escape to a secret First Family recon station with two other federation runaways, where they steal transportation and fly back to Wyoming. But this is according to the Family&#x27;s plan, and one of the runaways is a spy.
#&quot;Blood River&quot; (1988)Steve, Cadillac and Clearwater meet with triumph and disaster as they try to return to Clan M&#x27;Call, evading the clutches of both the Iron Masters and the disguised hunter/killer squads sent out by the Federation to purge the overground of renegade Trackers and deserters. Clearwater is seriously injured and only Federation medicine can save her; Steve uses his identity as a Federation agent to get her treatment.
#&quot;Death-Bringer&quot; (1989)With Clearwater now safely in their hands the First Family hatches a plan to use her as bait to capture Cadillac and Mr Snow and annihilate the Clan M&#x27;Call; a plan in which Steve is forced to continue his double-role as loyal agent of the Federation and blood-brother to the Plainfolk. In an apocalyptic battle, Mr. Snow and the Clan M&#x27;Call are destroyed, save Cadillac. Steve returns to the Federation to take care of Clearwater, while Roz escapes the Federation and joins with Cadillac.
#&quot;Earth-Thunder&quot; (1990)The &quot;Great Mountain in the West speaks to the Sky with a Tongue of Flame&quot;, signifying the Talisman Prophecy is on the verge of fulfillment. At that moment Clearwater goes in to labour with Steve&#x27;s child in a Federation hospital, and Roz conceives a child with Cadillac on the overground. The First Family celebrates their believed capture of the Talisman, but which child is the real chosen one, or are both part of the prophecy?

==Other material==
There is also a rare guide to the Amtrak Wars world titled &quot;Dark Visions: an illustrated guide to the Amtrak Wars&quot;, (Sphere Books, 1988).

==Revised edition==
In 1998 Orbit Books reissued the &quot;Amtrak Wars&quot; series with new covers and in a revised form that saw the Amtrak Federation renamed as the &#x27;Lone Star Confederation&#x27;. The final volume was also mildly re-edited to remove the definitive afterword/conclusion of the original series, leaving the book on more of a cliffhanger.

==Continuation==
&quot;The Amtrak Wars&quot; is notable for having a cliffhanger ending to the final published volume, in which two of the main characters are killed, one of the three main civilisations is plunged into civil war, and two children are born with pre-ordained destinies. However, since 1990 there have been no further additions to the series.

In a letter dated 26 August 1991 Patrick Tilley confirmed that both the fans and publishers wanted additional novels to be published in the series and he was pursuing the matter, but only if he could &quot;make it good enough&quot;. Rumours circulated for several years that additional novels in the sequence were being written, reaching a height in 1999 when a seventh volume was listed for publication by several websites. Unsubstantiated rumours surfaced in 2001 that Book 7 would be called &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, and that one of the characters apparently killed at the end of book 6 was not actually dead.

In 2007 Patrick Tilley once again hinted that the series would continue, although possibly only as a trilogy rather than six more books.

Tilley died in May 2020.

==Film adaptation==
In 2007 the books were optioned by an Australian production company with the intention of turning them into a series of feature films. In 2008–09 Patrick Tilley wrote a draft of the first script, entitled like the book, &quot;Cloud Warrior&quot;, and the production company continued pursuing the project in 2010, showing the script and tentative production artwork to several companies at the Cannes Film Festival. The proposed movie series is entitled &quot;The Talisman Prophecy&quot; rather than &quot;The Amtrak Wars&quot; and continues the practice from the revised edition of naming the Amtrak Federation as &#x27;The Lone Star Confederation&#x27;. Other changes include proposed variations to the design of Federation vehicles and technology from the books, and the removal of Ne-Issan to the Pacific Northwest rather than the Eastern Seaboard.

<doc id="613582" wikidata="Q1698782" url="?curid=613582" title="Mount Lao">
<text>Mount Lao, or Laoshan (), is a mountain located near the East China Sea on the southeastern coastline of the Shandong Peninsula in China. The mountain is culturally significant due to its long affiliation with Taoism and is often regarded as one of the &quot;cradles of Taoism&quot;. It is the highest coastal mountain in China and the second highest mountain in Shandong, with the highest peak (Jufeng) reaching . The mountain lies about to the northeast of the downtown area of the city of Qingdao and is protected by the Qingdao Laoshan National Park that covers an area of 446 square kilometers.

==Geology==
Mount Lao consists of granite. The mountain&#x27;s landforms were formed due to the action of glaciers during the Quaternary and erosion by meltwater released from the icecap that covered a large portion of Shandong during the late Pleistocene.

==History==
Laoshan is known as one of the birthplaces of Taoism. It is the place where the Complete Perfection School of Taoism () developed. In 412 CE the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Faxian landed near Laoshan on his return from India. In the course of history, the mountain has been known by various other names, which includes different spellings of &quot;Laoshan&quot; (劳山, 牢山) as well as entirely different names such as Mount Futang and Mount Ao (). The latter name was used by the Taoist Master Changchun who served as the top religious affairs official to Genghis Khan.

==Sites==
In the course of history, numerous palaces, Taoist temples, and nunneries have been constructed on Mount Lao. At the peak of Taoist worship, Mount Lao was home to about 1000 monks and nuns. However, many of these structures have not survived to the present. Major sites on Mount Lao are:

===Temple of Supreme Purity===

The largest temple complex on Mount Lao is that of the (), a Taoist temple that was first built during the Northern Song dynasty with the present structures dating to the reign of the Wanli Emperor in the Ming dynasty. The temple is located near the coast, below Pantao Peak on the southeastern foot of Mount Lao and is hence also known as the Lower Temple (), The main structure of the temple is the Hall of the Three Pure Ones () with houses statues of the Taoist Trinity (the Grand Pure One, the Supreme Pure One, the Jade Pure One). It is flanked by the Three Emperors Hall (to the left, ) and the Three Officials Hall (to the left, ). The Three Emperors Hall enshrines statues of Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor.

<text>Qingzhou () Wade–Giles: Tsing-chou, sometimes written as Ching-chow-fu, formerly Yidu County (Yitu) (), is a county-level city, which is located in the west of the prefecture-level city of Weifang, in the central part of Shandong Province, China. Qingzhou is a dynamic industry city, and also grows a great number of farm products. The local government holds an open policy of introduction of foreign capital, and has established strong business relationships with more than fifty countries and regions.

==History==

Qingzhou is named after one of the nine provinces that appear in the &quot;Yu Gong&quot; geography chapter of the classic &quot;Book of Documents&quot; composed during the Warring States period of Chinese history (403 BC － 221 BC). The history of this centuries old city dates back to ancient times twenty two centuries ago when it was part of the Dongyi area.

==Administrative divisions==
As 2012, this city is divided to 3 subdistricts and 9 towns.

*Yang Tian, a natural park with marvelous surface features. It is covered by virgin forest, through which crystal rivers are flowing, and dotted with quantities of natural rock cavities. What makes this park more amazing is the so-called thousand Buddha&#x27;s cave, which is considered as the first cave for the Buddhas. This is because of the huge volume of the cavern and the 1048 Buddhas in it that are in different postures and look extraordinarily vivid.

==Timeline==
*412: The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Faxian landed on the south of Shandong peninsula at Laoshan, and proceeded to Qingzhou to translate and edit the scriptures he had collected in India.
*1986: The name &quot;Qingzhou&quot; is recovered from &quot;Yi Du&quot;.
*1996: The discovery of over 200 buried Buddhist statues at Qingzhou was hailed as a major archaeological find. The statues included early examples of painted figures, and are thought to have been buried due to Emperor Huizong&#x27;s Song Dynasty repression of Buddhism (he favoured Taoism).

== History ==
Weifang has a long history. According to archaeological discoveries, there are more than 1,800 ancient cultural sites in different times in China. Among them, the first Beixin cultural relic in eastern Shandong was found in taoyuan village, Qingzhou; The ancient castle site of Longshan culture excavated by Shouguang Bianxian Wang is rare in China. The typical Longshan cultural site in Yaoguanzhuang, Weicheng District is rich in unearthed relics, far exceeding the excavation of Chengziya site before liberation.

This shows that as early as 7000 years ago, our ancestors lived here. In Xia and Shang dynasties, there were such countries as pouring irrigation, pouring bamboo, cold and three longevity. At the beginning of the Zhou dynasty, King Wu sealed the state and founded the country, and made Tai Gong Wang Yu Qi and Du Yingqiu (now in Changle). To the Spring and Autumn period, the present municipal districts once belonged to Qi, Lu, Qi, Ju and other countries. During the Warring States period, most of the current ministries were in harmony, and Wulian and Zhucheng belonged to Shandong.

As early as the Neolithic Age, there were ancestors living next to the old roads of Weihe River and Mihe River in Weifang. The ancient tribal people living here are called &quot;Dongyi people&quot;. They have created a rich and colorful Dongyi culture, which is one of the sources of Chinese civilization.

During the Eastern Zhou dynasty, Weifang belonged to the same land, bordering the Bohai Sea in the north, and it had the advantage of &quot;fish and salt&quot;. Counties were established in Qin dynasty, and most of Weifang belonged to Jiaodong County, Qi County and Langya County. In the fifth year of Emperor Yuan Feng of the Han dynasty (106 BC), Qingzhou Secretariat Department was established, which was located in Guang County (located in Qingzhou today).

<text>Alphington ( ) is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Darebin and Yarra local government areas. Alphington recorded a population of 5,702 at the .

Alphington shares a postcode with neighbouring suburb Fairfield, and is bounded by the Yarra River in the south and the Darebin Creek in the east.

==History==

Darebin Creek area is the traditional country of the Wurundjeri-willam people who are part of the Woiworung clan of the Kulin Nation, who are traditional owners of the country from west of Melbourne along to the Darebin Creek and to outer eastern Melbourne. For the Wurundjeri-willam people, the fertile Alphington region provided fresh water from the Darebin Creek and seasonal fish, tubers and shoots from water plants; while birds and animals provided clothing and food, trees and plants provided food and tools. 

The genesis of Alphington was the Bridge Hotel and Darebin Creek Bridge on Heidelberg Road, both commenced in the 1840s, with a new stone arch bridge erected in 1864.

Alphington was named by Sir William Manning after his birthplace, Alphington in Devon, England.

Alphington Post Office opened on 2 February 1858.

Alphington was originally part of the Jika Jika Parish, bounded by Rathmines Street to the west, Darebin Creek to the east, and the Yarra River to the south.

The character of Alphington East is dominated by detached housing, garden settings, Edwardian and inter-war houses. This area has little remaining industrial or commercial development and relied on easy access to railway lines and coach ways such as Heidelberg Road.

As with Richmond, most of the subdivision of this area arose in the boom era of the late 19th century but with only a few Victorian-era houses evident now.

The Yarra-side and hillside allotments could still, however, attract those gentlemen who owned a carriage. Hence when C.B. James and Percy Dobson released their Fulham Grange estate (the former Perry Brothers&#x27; orchards), they proclaimed that the acre lots on the Yarra were &#x27;ideal for Gentlemen&#x27;s Residences&#x27;. The St James Park estate, formed around Alphington St and Park Crescent, was also launched in the late Victorian-era.

Meanwhile, gas companies distributed their domestic gas supply over an ever wider area: the Northern Gas Co. was floated in 1887 and the Heidelberg Gas Co. commenced laying mains, in 1889, as the Heidelberg, Ivanhoe, Alphington and Fairfield Gas Co. Reticulated water was extended to Alphington in 1887. The bulk of housing development arose once efficient and cheap public transport was provided by the upgrade of the Heidelberg railway line in the Edwardian-era.

The Clifton Hill to Alphington railway line, isolated as it was from the main system, was built in 1883 but this was the only gesture from a Government which had been extending lines in every other direction across the Colony. It was not until 1889, near the end of the land boom, that a branch railway line was extended from Royal Park to Preston and later to Whittlesea, as well as across to the marooned &#x27;Nowhere to Nowhere&#x27; line from Clifton Hill to Alphington. A new line was built from Clifton Hill to Princes Bridge in 1901 to allow more direct rail access from Alphington and Fairfield (as well as Collingwood, Abbotsford and West Richmond) to the growing City of Melbourne and its industrial heartland in Richmond and Collingwood. Hence it was the Edwardian-era that allowed the potential for houses to be built in the Alphington area, often in the Queen Anne or Federation Bungalow Styles.

This was followed by the short-lived catch-up house boom, after World War I, in the Californian Bungalow style when emerging use of the motor car allowed less residential density further from main centres of industrial and commercial employment.

The small commercial group at the Yarralea Street and Heidelberg Road corner is part of a village that once had a church, hall and church school, bakery (in the City of Darebin) and the nearby Tower Hotel as its key structures. The two-storey stone shop &amp; residence and the old butcher&#x27;s shop in Heidelberg Road are contemporary with the stone church and form the beginning of a commercial area that today reflects the key period of development in that area, as also reflected by the housing to the south, with its early 20th century shops.

==Parks and open space==

Alphington has tracts of green open space, such as the Darebin Parklands and Alphington Park. The suburb also features the Latrobe Golf Club. The area around Alphington railway station contains a stand of River Red Gum trees, the oldest of which (closest to Platform 1) likely predates European settlement. These areas have been revegetated with indigenous plantings by local residents and the local Council beginning in the late 1990s and are now characterized by vigorous young Red Gum growth and the return of native fauna such as tawny frogmouths. Sightings of echidnas have been reported. 

A notable location in the part of Alphington to the south of Heidelberg Road is the revegetated wetlands. This area abuts the Yarra River, and includes the disused modification to the river bank once referred to as the Alphington Swimming Pool.

The Melbourne Innovation Centre is located just to the north east of the railway station and adjacent to the shallow valley of the Darebin Creek. There is no pedestrian access along the train bridge over the creek.

==Industry==


Amcor, a major paper production plant, operated a Paper Mill in Alphington between 1919 and 2012, after which the land was sold to become a residential development. The mill was demolished in 2017.

Amcor had been found guilty of polluting Alphington&#x27;s environment on at least three occasions; in 2001 for odour, in 2007 for discharging paper pulp into the Yarra and in 2008, Amcor was convicted for releasing oil into the Yarra from its Alphington plant and fined $80,000. In 2013, the company ceased operations at the Alphington plant.

An EPA air monitoring station can be found next to the railway station just to the north.

==Education==

Local schools include Alphington Grammar School, Alphington Primary School, and St Anthony&#x27;s Primary School. However, Alphington residents north of Wingrove Street are within the zone for Fairfield Primary School.

<text>Kingsbury is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Darebin local government area. Kingsbury recorded a population of 3,460 at the 2021 census.

The suburb was named after Bruce Kingsbury VC, who died in Papua New Guinea during the Second World War.

==Residential layout==

Kingsbury is an established suburb, with the majority of homes established in the 1960s from either weatherboard or brick. During the 2010s, there has been an increased number of new housing developments in the area with Kingsbury following the trend from neighbouring suburbs Reservoir and Preston, largely due to the large block land size and close proximity to public transport and the Melbourne CBD.
The suburb of Kingsbury previously had a golf course running through it before being built over in the 1960s for new housing developments. One side of Kingsbury&#x27;s street names are made up of golfing terms; Green Avenue, Eagle Avenue, Flag Street, Bunker Avenue, Club Avenue, Golf Avenue and The Fairway. The other half of Kingsbury&#x27;s street names reference famous poets from across the world; Lowell Avenue, Whittier Street, Scott Grove, Bradshaw Street, and Keats Avenue.

==Public transport==
===Bus===
Four bus routes service Kingsbury:

* : Reservoir station – La Trobe University. Operated by Dysons.
* : Whittlesea – Northland Shopping Centre via South Morang station. Operated by Dysons.
* : Macleod – Pascoe Vale station via La Trobe University. Operated by Dysons.
* : Lalor – Northland Shopping Centre via Childs Road, Plenty Road and Grimshaw Street. Operated by Dysons.

===Train===
The nearest railway station is Reservoir, on the Mernda line.

===Tram===
The suburb is also serviced by , which operates along Plenty Road between Waterfront City in Docklands and Bundoora RMIT, which touches Kingsbury between Stops 56–60.

==Education==

There are currently two primary schools and a university in Kingsbury; Kingsbury Primary School, Our Lady of the Way Catholic Primary School and La Trobe University. In 2011, Kingsbury Primary School named its new building the Isurava Centre for Learning, after the field in New Guinea in which Bruce Kingsbury fell.

==Parks==

<text>Northcote () is an inner suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Darebin local government area. Northcote recorded a population of 25,276 at the 2021 census.

==History==

The area now known as Northcote is on the traditional lands of the Wurundjeri people. According to the Darebin Historical Encyclopedia, European settlers knew the Wurundjeri as the &#x27;Yarra&#x27; tribe. They were closely associated with the Yarra River and its subsidiaries, with various subgroups of the tribe owning lands at various spots on the course of the Yarra.

The southerly surveyed portion is now Westgarth. It was the area further north of present-day Westgarth which saw settlement and development, particularly around the mansion built by William Rucker on Bayview Street in 1842 (the area now known as Ruckers Hill). Large, expensive houses were built throughout the Victorian gold rush of the 1850s. Lower Plenty Road (or High Street as it is known today) became the central street of Northcote, instead of Westgarth Street as initially proposed. A bridge was built across the Merri Creek in 1858, making access to the area more convenient. Throughout the 1850s, churches, schools, and hotels were built. (see Timeline). The Pilgrim Inn became the Red House hotel, at the back of which the owner, G. F. Goyder, constructed a racetrack, on which steeplechase and walking races were conducted.

Throughout the 1880s, land in Northcote was relatively cheap. This attracted speculative property investors, as well as people of limited financial means, setting in place Northcote&#x27;s reputation as a working-class suburb. More businesses opened along High Street, as well as churches and schools. The Little Sisters of the Poor began building on a site along St Georges Road, which still exists today. The town hall was built in 1890, the same year the Borough of Northcote was proclaimed. The Northcote Football Club was established in 1898, with its home ground at Northcote Park.

The Northcote Picture Theatre opened in 1912. Its building is now one of the oldest surviving picture theatres in Victoria. It is now used as a live music venue. A free library opened in 1911, financed by Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. Throughout the 1920s, development grew along St Georges Road. Northcote High School opened in 1926.

The Preston and Northcote Community Hospital (commonly known as &quot;PANCH&quot;) at 205 Bell Street, opened in 1958.

==Public transport==

Access to Northcote via public transport was initially via the Inner Circle line, which when linked to the Heidelberg line in 1888, ran close to the southern border of the suburb. The line to Whittlesea was opened in 1891, creating a direct line to Northcote, although the line initially journeyed via Royal Park, Carlton North and Fitzroy North, before a line was built from Clifton Hill to Melbourne through the suburbs of Collingwood and Richmond in 1901 to 1903. The northern section of the Inner Circle Line was closed to passengers in 1948, leaving the eastern section (from Melbourne to Clifton Hill, via Richmond and Collingwood).

===Bus===
Eight bus routes service Northcote:

* : Melbourne CBD (Queen Street) – La Trobe University (Bundoora Campus). Operated by Kinetic Melbourne.

===Train===
Northcote has five railway stations along two lines. The Mernda line serves Merri, Northcote and Croxton stations. The Hurstbridge line serves Westgarth and Dennis stations.

===Tram===
A cable tram began operations along High Street in 1890. It was replaced in the early 1940s by a double-decker bus service, which was in turn replaced with an electric tram service in the 1950s (now tram route ). An electric tram service opened along St Georges Road in 1920 (now tram route ).

==21st century gentrification==

Northcote as a suburb has undergone gentrification over the last 25 years. In the 1990s, Northcote was classified as a low socio-economic area relative to the rest of Melbourne. During the 1996 to 2006 decade, the number of two earner households rose by ten percentage points; the share of households in the top income quintile went from 14 to 19 per cent; and, the percentage of persons age 15 years and above with a bachelor&#x27;s degree or high rose from 14 to 27 per cent (a much greater increase than experience by Melbourne as a whole). In 2011, a report from the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute at Swinburne and Monash universities revealed Northcote had experienced the most intense gentrification of any Melbourne suburb in recent years. In 2013, Northcote was one of only four Melbourne suburbs whose median house price was at an all-time peak. This has resulted in a significant change in the demographics of the suburb. An AHURI report states that between 2001 and 2006, almost 35 per cent of the members of vulnerable groups, including low-income households, single parent families and immigrants, had moved out of the area.

Since 2006, the most significant increases in occupation have come from those working in professional and managerial roles, with less residents now living in Northcote employed in manual labour positions. As a result, residents of Northcote now earn on average $1536 a week, $200 per week higher than the Melbourne average. These changes in the population and demographics of Northcote and the greater Darebin area, have led to increases in the amount of cafes, bars, restaurants and other small businesses operating in the region. Estimates suggest that the greater Darebin area has seen its gross regional product increase by $1 billion in the last 10 years, to $5.23 billion.

In 2021, 72.3% of residents in Northcote were born in Australia. However, 51.3% of those residents born in Australia had at least one parent born overseas, and 34.2% had both parents born overseas. This reflects the large numbers of second-generation families living in the area.

The most common languages spoken in Northcote other than English are:

*Greek (6.5%)
*Italian (2.7%)
*Mandarin (1.0%)
*Vietnamese (0.9%)
*Spanish (0.9%)

==Parks==
===All Nations Park===
All Nations Park is located adjacent to the Northcote Plaza Shopping Centre (which itself opened in October 1981 at the site of the old brickworks).
All Nations Park is a contemporary 13 hectare regional park created on the site of the former Northcote brickworks. When the brickworks closed the site became a tip. In the 1980s, the rubbish still remaining in the site was sealed beneath a compacted clay &#x27;cap&#x27;, and was then covered in soil, including the formation of an artificial hill which newcomers to the area sometimes mistake for Ruckers Hill (actually located a few hundred metres to the southeast). There are also vents built into the ground to vent the gases produced by the landfill underneath, which prevents pressure under the soil from building up and potentially causing an explosion.

There are skating facilities, as well as basketball courts, play equipment and picnic facilities. There is a lot of open space. There is also a large native garden giving special attention to plants indigenous to the area, and a series of ponds.

The park was also the location of a December 2008 shooting involving police and a 15-year-old boy named Tyler Cassidy. Cassidy was shot several times and died on location., Tyler Cassidy is the youngest person confirmed to have been killed by Police in Australia.

===Batman Park===
(Coordinates ) is a metropolitan park. It was purchased by the Northcote Council in 1907 and is recognised for its historical significance as the second oldest park in Northcote. It hosts many established trees for shade and is close to buses, trains and trams. As part of a wider campaign to remove the controversial explorer John Batman&#x27;s name from public places and buildings, the park was renamed from Batman Park to Gumbri Park in May 2017, in honour of the last Aboriginal girl to be born on Coranderrk mission. 1n 2018, the name change was rejected by the direct descendants of Gumbri, Ian and Gary Hunter, so the name change was rejected by the Office of Geographic Names. The current status of the name change is unknown as a result. The park hosts a playcentre, a playground, toilets, and the Pioneer&#x27;s Retreat building, currently used by an incorporated association, We-Cycle.

===Johnson Park===
Johnson Park is a popular large neighbourhood park of almost two hectares. The land Johnson Park occupies was purchased by the former City of Northcote in 1859. The traditional owners of land where Johnson Park stands today are the Wurundjeri-Willampatriliny people. In 1913, five acres was bought in Bastings Street on the flat low-lying basalt soils between Rucker Hill and Darebin Creek. Originally known as the East Ward Park, it was slowly transformed into what was to become Johnson Park today.

==Politics==

The state seat of Northcote is currently represented by Kat Theophanous, a member of the Labor Party and the federal seat of Cooper, which covers Northcote, is held by Ged Kearney, also from the ALP. The state seat of Northcote was one of the safest Labor seats in the entire country, being held by a Labor member continuously from 1927 to 2017. After a steady increase in their primary vote from the early 2000s, The Greens eventually won the seat in the 2017 by-election following the death of Labor member Fiona Richardson, represented by Lidia Thorpe. Labor then regained the seat following the 2018 Victorian state election.

The ALP in Northcote has been the subject of a number of academic studies. Ethnic branches were established in Northcote during 1975, the first in Victoria. The first branches were Westgarth, a Greek branch, and Croxton, an Italian branch. An additional Greek branch, Northcote East, was also established in the area.

The 2022 Victorian State Election campaign has seen alleged vandalism of election advertisements, particularly targeted at ALP Candidate Kat Theophanous.

<doc id="613606" wikidata="Q2328318" url="?curid=613606" title="Natural-gas condensate">
<text>Natural-gas condensate, also called natural gas liquids, is a low-density mixture of hydrocarbon liquids that are present as gaseous components in the raw natural gas produced from many natural gas fields. Some gas species within the raw natural gas will condense to a liquid state if the temperature is reduced to below the hydrocarbon dew point temperature at a set pressure.

The natural gas condensate is also called condensate, or gas condensate, or sometimes natural gasoline because it contains hydrocarbons within the gasoline boiling range, and is also referred to by the shortened name condy by many workers on gas installations. Raw natural gas used to create condensate may come from any type of gas well such as:

* Crude oil wells: Natural gas that comes from crude oil wells is typically called &quot;associated gas&quot;. This gas could exist as a separate gas cap above the crude oil in the underground reservoir or could be dissolved in the crude oil, ultimately coming out of solution as the pressure is reduced during production. Condensate produced from oil wells is often referred to as &quot;lease condensate&quot;.
* Dry gas wells: These wells typically produce only raw natural gas that contains no condensate with little to no crude oil and are called &quot;non-associated&quot; gas. Condensate from dry gas is extracted at gas processing plants and is often called &quot;plant condensate&quot;.
* Condensate wells: These wells typically produce raw natural gas along with natural gas liquid with little to no crude oil and are called &quot;non-associated&quot; gas. Such raw natural gas is often referred to as wet gas.

==Composition==
There are many condensate sources, and each has its own unique gas condensate composition. In general, gas condensate has a specific gravity ranging from 0.5 to 0.8, and is composed of hydrocarbons such as propane, butane, pentane, and hexane. Natural gas compounds with more than two carbon atoms exist as liquids at ambient temperatures and pressures. Propane, butane, and isobutane are liquid at normal temperatures only under pressure. Additionally, condensate may contain:

*Heavier straight-chain alkanes having from 7 to 12 carbon atoms (denoted as to )
*Hydrogen sulfide ()
*Thiols traditionally also called mercaptans (denoted as RSH, where R is an organic group such as methyl, ethyl, etc.)
*Carbon dioxide ()
*Cyclohexane and perhaps other naphthenes
*BTX (chemistry) (Aromatics such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, and ethylbenzene)

==Separating the condensate from the raw natural gas==
There are hundreds of different equipment configurations to separate natural gas condensate from raw natural gas. The schematic flow diagram to the right depicts just one of the possible configurations.

The raw natural gas feedstock from a gas well or a group of wells is cooled to lower the gas temperature to below its hydrocarbon dew point at the feedstock pressure. This condenses a large part of the gas condensate hydrocarbons. The feedstock mixture of gas, liquid condensate and water is then routed to a high pressure separator vessel where the water and the raw natural gas are separated and removed. If a pressure boost is required, the raw natural gas from the high pressure separator is sent to the main gas compressor, which raises the pressure of the gases to whatever pressure is required for the pipeline transportation of the gas to the raw natural gas processing plant. The main gas compressor discharge pressure will depend upon the operating pressure of and the distance to the raw natural gas processing plant and may require a multi-stage compressor.

The gas condensate from the high pressure separator flows through a throttling control valve to a low pressure separator. The reduction in pressure across the control valve causes the condensate to undergo a partial vaporization referred to as flash vaporization. The raw natural gas from the low pressure separator is sent to a &quot;booster&quot; compressor that raises the gas pressure and sends it through a cooler, and then to the main gas compressor.

At the raw natural gas processing plant, the gas will be dehydrated and acid gases and other impurities will be removed from the gas. Then, the ethane (), propane (), butanes (), and pentanes ()—plus higher molecular weight hydrocarbons referred to as C5+—will also be removed and recovered as byproducts.

The water removed from both the high and low pressure separators may need to be processed to remove hydrogen sulfide () before the water can be disposed of underground or reused in some fashion.

Some of the raw natural gas may be re-injected into the producing formation to help maintain the reservoir pressure, or for storage pending later installation of a pipeline.

==Dangers==
Natural gas condensate is generally more flammable and explosive than normal crude oil. Operating in areas where condensate has escaped is dangerous for crew due to the danger of explosions, oxygen displacement and the threat of asphyxiating and anaesthetizing, which can occur within a few human breaths.

==Use as a diluent in heavy oil production==
Because condensate is typically liquid in ambient conditions and also has very low viscosity, condensate is often used to dilute highly viscous heavier oils that cannot otherwise be efficiently transported via pipelines. In particular, condensate is frequently mixed with bitumen from oil sands to create dilbit. In 2013, the increased use of condensate as diluent significantly increased its price in certain regions.

==Drip gas and uses==
Drip gas, so named because it can be drawn off the bottom of small chambers (called &quot;drips&quot;) sometimes installed in pipelines from gas wells, is another name for natural-gas condensate, a naturally occurring form of gasoline obtained as a byproduct of natural gas extraction. It is also known as &quot;condensate&quot;, &quot;natural gasoline&quot;, &quot;casing head gas&quot;, &quot;raw gas&quot;, &quot;white gas&quot; and &quot;liquid gold&quot;. Drip gas is defined in the United States Code of Federal Regulations as consisting of butane, pentane, and hexane hydrocarbons. Within set ranges of distillation, drip gas may be extracted and used to denature fuel alcohol. Drip gas is also used as a cleaner and solvent as well as a lantern and stove fuel.

==Historical use in vehicles==

Some early internal combustion engines—such as the first types made by Karl Benz, and early Wright brothers aircraft engines—used natural gasoline, which could be either drip gas or a similar range of hydrocarbons distilled from crude oil. Natural gasoline has an octane rating of about 30 to 50, sufficient for the low-compression engines of the early 20th century. By 1930, improved engines and higher compression ratios required higher-octane, refined gasolines to produce power without knocking or detonation.

Beginning in the Great Depression, drip gas was used as a replacement for commercial gasoline by people in oil-producing areas. &quot;In the days of simple engines in automobiles and farm tractors it was not uncommon for anyone having access to a condensate well to fill his tank with &#x27;drip,&#x27;&quot; according to the Oklahoma Historical Society. Sometimes it worked fine. &quot;At other times it might cause thundering backfires and clouds of foul-smelling smoke.&quot;

Certain manufacturers such as John Deere made farm tractors specifically designed to run on heavy, low-octane fuels which were commonly called &quot;distillate&quot; or &quot;tractor fuel&quot;. Other names were tractor vaporising oil (United Kingdom) and &quot;power kerosene&quot; (Australia). Often the tractors were referred to as &quot;all-fuel&quot;. The most important factor in burning heavy fuels in a spark-ignition engine is proper fuel vaporization. Tractors designed to run on those fuels usually used a &quot;hot&quot; intake air manifold that allowed exhaust heat to warm the manifold and carburetor to aid vaporization. Given the poor vaporization at low temperatures, all-fuel tractors were started on gasoline, then switched to the heavy fuel. They were equipped with a small gasoline tank and a large fuel tank, both of which fed into a common valve supplying the fuel to the carburetor.

The engine would be started on gasoline and the tractor would then be worked until the engine was sufficiently warm to change over. At that point, the fuel valve would be turned to switch the fuel supply from the gasoline tank to the fuel tank and the heavy fuel would flow to the carburetor. Shutters or curtains were typically used to restrict airflow to the radiator, keeping the engine sufficiently hot for efficient operation. Coolant temperatures in the 200 degree F range were normal. John Deere two-cylinder all-fuel tractors worked well on heavy fuel, as their long piston strokes, slow engine speeds and low compression ratios allowed for effective use of the fuel. Most were also equipped with thermosiphon cooling systems that used no water pumps. Natural convection allowed the water to flow up and out of the engine block and into the top of the radiator, where it cooled and dropped and fell to continue the cycle.

Woody Guthrie&#x27;s autobiographical novel &quot;Seeds of Man&quot; begins with Woody and his uncle Jeff tapping a natural gas pipeline for drip gas. The gas also has a mention in Terrence Malick&#x27;s movie &quot;Badlands&quot;.

Drip gas was sold commercially at gas stations and hardware stores in North America until the early 1950s. The white gas sold today is a similar product but is produced at refineries with the carcinogen benzene removed.
In 1975, the New Mexico State Police&#x27;s drip gas detail – three men in pickup trucks – began patrolling oil and gas fields, catching thieves and recovering barrels of stolen gas. The detail stopped its work in 1987.

The use of drip gas in cars and trucks is now illegal in many states. It is also harmful to modern engines due to its low octane rating, much higher combustion temperature than that of gasoline, and lack of additives. It has a distinctive smell when used as a fuel, which allowed police to sometimes catch people using drip gas illegally.

<text> (; ; ) was a pejorative legal term which was used in Nazi Germany to denote persons of mixed &quot;Aryan&quot; and &quot;non-Aryan&quot;, such as Jewish, ancestry as they were classified by the Nuremberg racial laws of 1935. In German, the word has the general denotation of &#x27;hybrid&#x27;, &#x27;mongrel&#x27;, or &#x27;half-breed&#x27;. Outside its use in official Nazi terminology, the term (&#x27;mixed children&#x27;) was later used to refer to war babies born to non-white soldiers and German mothers in the aftermath of World War II.

==Nazi definitions of Mischling==
Since the Nazis were unable to find a racial definition of a &quot;Jew&quot;, they relied on one&#x27;s ancestors&#x27; religious backgrounds to determine whether someone was of &quot;German or related blood&quot; (&quot;Aryan&quot;) or a &quot;Jew&quot; (&quot;non-Aryan&quot;). Thus, the Nuremberg Laws in 1935 defined a &quot;full Jew&quot; (&quot;Istjude&quot; or &quot;Volljude&quot; in Nazi terminology) as a person – regardless of religious affiliation or self-identification – who had at least three grandparents who had been enrolled with a Jewish congregation or were married to a Jewish spouse. A person with two Jewish grandparents was also legally &quot;Jewish&quot; (so-called &quot;Geltungsjude&quot;, roughly speaking, in or &quot;to be deemed/reckoned as a Jew&quot;) if that person met any of these racial conditions created by Nazis:
*Was enrolled as a member of a Jewish congregation when the Nuremberg Laws were issued or joined later
*Was married to a &quot;full Jew&quot;.
*Was the offspring from a marriage with a Jew, which was concluded after the ban on mixed marriages.
*Was the offspring of an extramarital affair with a Jew, born out of wedlock after 31 July 1936&quot;.
A person who did not belong to any of these categorical conditions, but had two Jewish grandparents was classified as a Jewish &quot;Mischling&quot; of the first degree according to the racial constructs implemented by Nazis. A person with only one Jewish grandparent was classified as a &quot;Mischling&quot; of the second degree.

Following the passage of the Nuremberg Laws, in November 1935, the Citizenship Law gained its first amendment, and it stated that Jews were to be stripped of all of their civil rights, including the right to vote. Within the amendment the Law for the Defense of German Blood and Honor took effect, defining various forbidden marriage scenarios for Mischling specifically. Nazis claimed that it was acceptable for Mischling of the first degree to marry “full Jews” in turn becoming Jewish as well as marry other Mischling. However, this law prohibited Mischling from marrying Germans and thereby mixing “races”. Hitler’s goal of this amendment was to have as many Mischling as possible become a “full Jew” through marriage. A month later a second amendment was added to the Citizenship Law on December 21, 1935, which continued the persecution against Jews by removing “full Jews” or Mischling from professions such as those in the education, health, and civic departments.

According to the 1939 Reich census, there were about 72,000 &quot;Mischlinge&quot; of the 1st degree, ~39,000 of the 2nd degree, and potentially tens of thousands at higher degrees, which went unrecorded as those people were considered Aryans by the Reich.
According to historian Bryan Mark Rigg, up to 160,000 soldiers who were one-quarter, one-half, and even fully Jewish served in the German armed forces during World War II. This included several generals, admirals, and at least one field marshal: Erhard Milch.

==Jewish identity in society==
Soon after the passage of the Enabling Act of 1933, the Nazi government promulgated several antisemitic statutes, including the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service on 7 April 1933. Using this law, the regime aimed to dismiss—along with all politically-suspect persons such as social democrats, socialists, communists, and many liberals of all religions—all &quot;non-Aryans&quot; from all government positions in society, including public educators, and those practicing medicine in state hospitals.

As a result, the term &quot;non-Aryan&quot; had to be defined in a way that was compatible with Nazi ideology. Under the &quot;First Racial Definition&quot; supplementary decree of 11 April, issued to clarify portions of the act passed four days prior, a &quot;non-Aryan&quot; (e.g., a Jew) was defined as one who had at least one Jewish parent or grandparent. Later, German citizens with only one Jewish grandparent were defined by the Nuremberg Laws as &quot;Mischling&quot; of the second degree. Their employment restrictions remained, but they were permitted to marry non-Jewish and non-&quot;Mischling&quot; Germans, and were not imprisoned. This distinction was not applied to non-German citizens.

According to the philosophy of Nazi antisemitism, Jewry was considered a group of people bound by close, genetic (blood) ties who formed an ethnic unit that one could neither join nor secede from. Early 20th-century books on Nordicism such as Madison Grant&#x27;s &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot; had a profound effect on Hitler&#x27;s antisemitism. He was convinced that the Nordic Race/Culture constituted a superior branch of humanity, and viewed International Jewry as a parasitic and inferior race, determined to corrupt and exterminate both Nordic peoples and their culture through &quot;Rassenschande&quot; (&quot;racial pollution&quot;) and cultural corruption.

Hitler declared that Marxism was constructed by International Jewry, with the aim of Bolshevising the earth, ultimately allowing Jewry to dominate/exterminate the Aryan race. With this in mind, Hitler viewed Russia as a nation of &quot;Untermenschen&quot; (&quot;subhumans&quot; or &#x27;Inferiors&quot;) dominated by their Judaic masters, which posed the gravest threat to both Germany and Europe as a whole.

The Nazis defined Jewishness as partly genetic, but did not always use formal genetic tests or physiognomic (facial) features to determine one&#x27;s status (although the Nazis talked a lot about physiognomy as a racial characteristic). In practice, records concerning the religious affiliation(s) of one&#x27;s grandparents were often the deciding factor (mostly christening records and membership registers of Jewish congregations).

===Reclassification procedures===
Nonetheless, reclassification procedures of &quot;Mischling&quot; were conducted within society. These requests for reclassification (e.g., Jew to &quot;Mischling&quot; of 1st degree, &quot;Mischling&quot; of 1st degree to 2nd degree, etc.) or Aryanization (see German Blood Certificate) were rarely given, as each had to be personally reviewed and concurred by Adolf Hitler. Once approved by the Nazi party chancellery and Hitler, it was recognized throughout the Nazi community as an act of grace (&quot;Gnadenakt&quot;). Other de facto reclassifications, lacking any official document, were privileges accorded by high-ranking Nazis to certain artists and other experts by way of special protection.

The second way of reclassification was through a declaratory judgment in court. Usually, the discriminated person took the action, questioning their descent from the Jewish-classified man until then regarded as their biological (grand)father. Paternity suits aiming for reclassification () appeared mostly with deceased, divorced, or illegitimate (grand)fathers. They usually sought to change the discriminated litigant&#x27;s status from Jewish-classified to &quot;Mischling&quot; of first degree, or from &quot;Mischling&quot; of first degree to second degree. The numbers of such suits soared whenever the Nazi government imposed new discriminations and persecutions (such as the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, Kristallnacht in 1938, and the systematic deportations of Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent to concentration camps in 1941).

The process was humiliating for the (grand)mothers who had to declare in court that they had committed adultery. The petitions were successful in the majority of cases. The high success rate recorded was a result of several factors. First, there was no risk in paternity suits since litigant classification cannot be downgraded. Consequently, lawyers were willing to represent litigants, though it was common practice to refuse hopeless cases. Some lawyers even specialized in this type of procedure. Second, usually, all the family members cooperated; including the sometimes still-living disputed (grand)father. Likely alternative fathers were often named, who either appeared themselves in court confirming their likely fatherhood, or who were already dead but were known as good friends, neighbors, or subtenants of the (grand)mother. Third, the obligatory and humiliating body examinations of those under suspicion were skewed by stereotypical Jewish perceptions. Expert witnesses would search for allegedly Jewish facial features, as conceived and understood by anti-Semites. If the doubted (grand)father was already dead, emigrated, or deported (as after 1941), the examination searched for these supposedly &quot;Jewish&quot; features in the physiognomy of the descendant (child). Since anti-Semitic clichés on Jewish outward appearance were so stereotyped, the average litigant did not show features clearly indicating their Jewish descent, so they often documented ambiguous results as medical evidence. Fourth, the judges tended to believe the accounts of the (grand)mothers, alternative fathers, doubted fathers, and other witnesses who had endured such public humiliation. They were not recorded for earlier perjuring, and judges would declare the prior paternity annulled, ensuring the status improvement for the litigant.

===Standards of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS)===
The Schutzstaffel (SS) used a more stringent standard. In order to join, a candidate had to prove (presumably through baptismal records) that all direct ancestors born since 1750 were not Jewish, or they would have to apply for a German Blood Certificate instead. When the stresses of World War II made it impracticable to confirm the ancestry of officer candidates, the extended proof of ancestry regulation was diminished to the standard laws requiring certified evidence of non-Judaism within two generations.

===Jewish &quot;Mischlinge&quot; as Christian converts===
In the 19th century, many Jewish Germans converted to Christianity; most of them becoming Protestants rather than Catholics. Two-thirds of the German population were Protestant until 1938, when the Anschluss annexation of Austria to Germany added six million Catholics. The addition of 3.25 million Catholic Czechoslovaks of German ethnicity (Sudeten Germans) increased the percentage of Roman Catholics in Greater Germany to 41% (approximately 32.5 million vs. 45.5 million Protestants or 57%) in a 1939 population estimated at 79 million. One percent of the population was Jewish.

German converts from Judaism typically adopted whichever Christian denomination was most dominant in their community. Therefore, about 80% of the Gentile Germans persecuted as Jews according to the Nuremberg Laws were affiliated with one of the 28 regionally-delineated Protestant church bodies. In 1933, approximately 77% of German Gentiles with Jewish ancestry were Protestant. In the 1939 census, however, the percentage dropped to 66%. This is due to the annexation of several areas in 1938, including Vienna and Prague, both of which have relatively large and well-established Catholic populations of Jewish descent. Converts to Christianity and their descendants had often married Christians with no recent Jewish ancestry.

As a result, by the time the Nazis came to power, many Protestants and Roman Catholics in Germany had some traceable Jewish ancestry (usually traced back by the Nazi authorities for two generations), so that the majority of 1st- or 2nd-degree &quot;Mischlinge&quot; were Protestant, yet many were Catholics. A considerable number of German Gentiles with Jewish ancestry were irreligionists.

Lutherans with Jewish ancestry were largely in northwestern and northern Germany, Evangelical Protestants of Jewish descent in Central Germany (Berlin and its southwestern environs) and the country&#x27;s east. Catholics with Jewish ancestry lived mostly in Western and Southern Germany, Austria and what is now the Czech Republic.

==&quot;Mischlinge&quot;-founded organizations==
On 20 July 1933, initiated by the actor Gustav Friedrich, Christian Germans of Jewish descent founded a self-help organisation, initially named &quot;Reich Federation of Christian-German Citizens of non-Aryan or not of purely Aryan descent&quot; (). The federation first counted only 4,500 members. In October 1934, the name was shortened to &quot;Reich association of non-Aryan Christians&quot; (). In 1935, members of the federation elected the known literary historian their new president. Under his direction the federation&#x27;s journal was improved and the number of members rose to 80,000 by 1936. In September 1936, the federation was renamed the more confident &quot;St Paul&#x27;s Covenant Union of non-Aryan Christians&quot; () after the famous Jewish convert to Christianity Paul the Apostle.

In January 1937, the Nazi government forbade that organisation, allowing a new successor organisation named the &quot;1937 Association of Provisional Reich Citizens of not purely German-blooded Descent&quot; (). This name cited the insecure legal status of &quot;Mischlinge&quot;, who had been assigned the revocable status of preliminary Reich&#x27;s citizens by the Nuremberg Laws, while Jewish-classified Germans had become second-class state citizens (&quot;Staatsbürger&quot;) by these laws. The 1937 Association was prohibited from accepting state citizens as members—like Spiero—with three or four grandparents, who had been enrolled in a Jewish congregation. Thus that new association had lost its most prominent leaders and faded, having become an organisation solely for &quot;Mischlinge&quot;. The &quot;1937 Association&quot; was compulsorily dissolved in 1939.

Pastor Heinrich Grüber and some enthusiasts started a new effort in 1936 to found an organisation to help Protestants of Jewish descent (&quot;Mischlinge&quot; and their (grand)parents, of whom at least one was classified as non-Aryan), but went completely neglected by the then official Protestant church bodies in Germany (see Protestants of Jewish descent).

After the war some &quot;Mischlinge&quot; founded the still-existing &quot;Notgemeinschaft der durch die Nürnberger Gesetze Betroffenen&quot; (Emergency association of those affected by the Nuremberg Laws).

==Fate during the Nazi era==

===Discrimination in education, vocation and marriage===
Those who were considered &quot;Mischlinge&quot; were generally restricted in their options of partners and marriage. &quot;Mischlinge&quot; of first degree generally needed permission to marry, and usually only to other &quot;Mischlinge&quot; or Jewish-classified persons; however, a marriage to a Jewish-classified person would re-categorize the &quot;Mischling&quot; as &quot;Geltungsjude&quot; (Full Jew). After 1942, marriage permissions were generally not granted any more—arguably due to the war—without further notice. &quot;Mischlinge&quot; of second degree did not need permission to marry a spouse classified as Aryan; however, marriage with &quot;Mischlinge&quot; of any degree was unwelcome. The reasoning behind this was that a &quot;Mischling&quot; marrying an Aryan would produce a child with an acceptably low amount of Jewish heritage, but a &quot;Mischling&quot; marrying a &quot;Mischling&quot; would just produce another &quot;Mischling&quot;.

1st-degree &quot;Mischlinge&quot;, more so than those of 2nd-degree, had restricted access to higher education and were generally forbidden from attending such schools in 1942. As for vocations, most jobs in the public sphere—such as journalism, teaching, performing arts, government positions, politics etc.—were inaccessible to &quot;Mischlinge&quot;. Exceptions were granted for some prominent persons and those who acquired the necessary German blood certificates.

===Mischlinge recruitment into the Organization Todt===
Organization Todt served as a civil and military-based engineering program that was named after its founder, Fritz Todt. This group became notorious for utilizing forced labor to develop large-scaled constructional projects throughout Germany and Nazi-occupied territories. Beginning in the autumn of 1944, between 10,000 and 20,000 half-Jews (&quot;Mischlinge&quot;) and persons related to Jews by a so-called mixed marriage were recruited into special units of the Organisation Todt.

===Jewish Mischlinge in German-occupied Europe===
While the classifications of &quot;Mischling&quot; also applied in occupied Western and Central Europe, and were well-documented for the Netherlands and Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia, this was not the case in Eastern Europe. Persons who would have been deemed Jewish &quot;Mischlinge&quot;, in the East were classified as Jews in German-annexed Poland (Danzig-West Prussia, Warthegau, etc.), German-occupied Poland (General Government), German-occupied parts of the Soviet Union, and the German-occupied Soviet-annexed Baltic/Eastern Polish territories. Consequently, an unknown number of Christians of recent Jewish background from Poland and other occupied territories, primarily Catholics or Eastern Orthodox in this case, were killed as &quot;Jewish&quot; in the Holocaust.

<text>NGC 300 (also known as Caldwell 70 or the Sculptor Pinwheel Galaxy) is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Sculptor. It was discovered on 5 August 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop. It is one of the closest galaxies to the Local Group, and it most likely lies between the latter and the Sculptor Group. It is the brightest of the five main spirals in the direction of the Sculptor Group. It is inclined at an angle of 42° when viewed from Earth and shares many characteristics of the Triangulum Galaxy. It is 94,000 light-years in diameter, somewhat smaller than the Milky Way, and has an estimated mass of (2.9 ± 0.2) × 1010 .

==Nearby galaxies and group information==
NGC 300 and the irregular galaxy NGC 55 have traditionally been identified as members of the Sculptor Group, a nearby group of galaxies in the constellation of the same name. However, recent distance measurements indicate that these two galaxies actually lie in the foreground. It is likely that NGC 300 and NGC 55 form a gravitationally bound pair.

The dwarf galaxy Sculptor C is located about 6.65 million light-years (2.04 megaparsecs) away from the Sun, and is very likely a satellite galaxy of NGC 300. Sculptor C has an absolute magnitude of about −9.1 which is typical for other recently discovered ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.

==Distance estimates==
In 1986, Allan Sandage estimated the distance to NGC 300 to be 5.41 Mly (1.66 Mpc). By 1992, this had been updated to 6.9 Mly (2.1 Mpc) by Freedman et al. In 2006, this was revised by Karachentsev et al. to be (). At about the same time, the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method was used to produce an estimate of () using edge detection and () using maximum likelihood. These results were consistent with estimates using near-infrared photometry of Cepheid variables by Gieren et al. 2005 that provided an estimate of (). Combining the recent TRGB and Cepheid estimates the distance to NGC 300 is estimated at ().

==NGC 300-OT==
On a CCD image obtained on May 14, 2008, amateur astronomer L.A.G. Berto Monard discovered a bright optical transient (OT) in NGC 300 that is designated NGC 300-OT. It is located at RA:  and DEC:  in a spiral arm containing active star formation. Its broad-band magnitude was 14.3 in that image. An earlier image (from April 24, 2008), taken just after NGC 300 reemerged from behind the Sun, evidenced an already brightening OT at ~16.3 magnitude. No brightening was detected on a February 8, 2008 image or on any earlier ones. The transient&#x27;s peak measured magnitude was 14.69 on May 15, 2008.

At discovery, the transient had an absolute magnitude of , making it faint in comparison to a typical core-collapse supernova but bright in comparison to a classical nova. Additionally, the photometric and spectroscopic properties of the OT imply that it is not a luminous blue variable either. Since its peak, brightness dropped smoothly through September 2008 while becoming continuously redder. After September 2008, brightness continued to fall at a lower rate in the optical spectrum but with strong Hα emissions. Further, the optical spectrum is mostly made up of fairly narrow Hydrogen Balmer and Ca II emission lines coupled with strong Ca II H&amp;K absorption. Research into historical Hubble images provide an accurate upper bound on the progenitor star&#x27;s brightness. This suggested a low-mass main sequence star as progenitor with the transient resulting from a stellar merger similar to red Galactic nova V838 Monocerotis. Analysis of historical images of the area of the OT suggest with 70% certainty that the progenitor formed in a burst of stars around 8–13 Myr ago and implies the progenitor&#x27;s mass to be 12–25 M⊙ assuming the OT is due to an evolving massive star.

However, in 2008 a bright mid-infrared progenitor to the transient was discovered in historical Spitzer data. This was a star that was obscured by dust, with energy distribution analogous to a black-body of AU and radiating at K with . This demonstrated that the transient was associated with an energetic explosion of a low-mass ≈ 10 M⊙ star. The transient&#x27;s low luminosity as compared to typical core-collapse supernova, combined with its spectral attributes and dust covered properties, make it nearly identical to NGG 6946&#x27;s SN 2008S.

The spectrum of NGC 300-OT observed with Spitzer shows strong, broad emission features at 8 μm and 12 μm. Such features are also seen in Galactic carbon-rich protoplanetary nebulae.

==SN 2010da==
On May 23, 2010, Monard discovered another transient object of 16th magnitude, denoted as SN 2010da. The optical transient was detected 15&quot;.9 west and 16&quot;.8 north the center of the galaxy at coordinates 00 55 04.86 −37 41 43.7.

Two sets of independent follow-up spectroscopy data suggested that this was again another optical transient rather than a supernova, possibly an outbursting luminous blue variable star according to one spectrum, as earlier predicted from the nature of the candidate mid-infrared progenitor. The transient faded by 0.5–0.7 mag in 9 days, much faster than the 2008 transient in NGC 300.

== Other Novae, Supernovae, and Transients ==

AT 2019qyl was discovered on 26 September 2019, at magnitude 17.1. It was initially classified as a type IIn/LBV, but later analysis classified the star as a classical nova.

SN 2020acli (type IIn-pec, mag. 18.4205) was discovered by the &quot;Distance Less Than 40 Mpc Survey&quot; (DLT40) on 12 December 2020.

AT 2024oth (type unknown, mag. 19.85) was discovered by BlackGEM on 27 June 2024.

AT 2024txt (type unknown, mag. 19.77) was discovered by Pan-STARRS on 29 July 2024.

==Binary black hole system==
An x-ray source in NGC 300 is designated NGC 300 X-1. Astronomers speculate that NGC 300 X-1 is a new kind of Wolf-Rayet + stellar black hole binary system similar to the confirmed such system IC 10 X-1. Their shared properties include an orbital period of 32.8 hours. The black hole has a mass of 17 ± 4 and the WR star has a mass of . Both objects orbit each other at a distance of about 18.2 .

== WO star ==
There is an oxygen-sequence Wolf-Rayet star (WO4 type), known as STWR 13, located in one of the bright H II regions in NGC 300.

<text>Christ Church Cathedral () is an Anglican Gothic Revival cathedral in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the seat of the Anglican Diocese of Montreal. It is located at 635 Saint Catherine Street West, between Avenue Union and Boulevard Robert-Bourassa. It is situated on top of the Promenades Cathédrale underground shopping mall, and south of Tour KPMG. It was classified as historical monument by the government of Quebec on May 12, 1988. In 1999, it was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.

== History ==
An Anglican ministry first began in Montreal in 1760. Services were held in chapels of the Roman Catholic Church for the first half-century. In 1789, the Anglican congregation of Montreal received a former Jesuit church, renaming it as Christ Church. The building was used by the congregation until 1803, when it was destroyed in a fire. The clergyman was appointed by Dorchester as garrison chaplain of Montreal in 1766, with inaugural service in Christ Church was pronounced by him on 20 December 1789. The first Christ Church was in fact the repaired and re-dedicated Jesuit church. So it was the second church building that was constructed in 1814.

In 1850, the second Christ Church was designated as the cathedral for the new Anglican Diocese of Montreal upon its separation from the Anglican Diocese of Quebec. The cathedral was destroyed by fire in 1856.

The present cathedral, a neo-Gothic structure, was designed by architect Frank Wills (1822–1856), who also designed Christ Church Cathedral in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Before construction began, Willis died, and Montreal architect Thomas Seaton Scott (1826–1895) was commissioned to carry out his design. The structure was completed in 1859 and consecrated in 1867.

Andrew Taylor oversaw alterations and other restoration of the cathedral from 1890 to 1891 and installed a memorial window for Mrs. A.C. Hooper in 1902–03.

Modeled after the 14th century Gothic-style churches of the English countryside, the cathedral features a square crossing tower.

Unfortunately, the design, though acclaimed for its architecture, suffered from important engineering flaws. The soft ground could not support the heavy central stone tower and steeple, which began to subside and lean. This defect formed the basis of an important lawsuit concerning builder&#x27;s liability, which went all the way to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the highest court in the British Empire. The Judicial Committee upheld the decisions of the Quebec courts, which had held that the builder was liable for having built the steeple on ground that could not support its weight: &quot;Wardle v. Bethune&quot; The case was often cited as precedent relating to article 1688 of Quebec&#x27;s original Civil Code.

By 1920, the tower leaned to the south. George Allan Ross designed alterations in 1923 and reconstructed the tower from 1939 to 1940. In 1927, the stone steeple, weighing was removed. New foundations were poured in 1939, and in 1940, an anonymous donation permitted the construction of a much lighter steeple made of aluminum, molded to simulate the former stone spire. It is high, attaining a height of from the ground.

Recent additions to the church include a choir gallery, built in 1980, and the church&#x27;s third organ, installed in 1981. Notable musicians to have served as the church&#x27;s organist include Alfred Whitehead (1922–1947), S. Drummond Wolff (1952–1956) and Patrick Wedd ( 1996–2018).

The organ is opus 77 of Karl Wilhelm, Inc. of Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Quebec. It is a mechanical key and stop instrument with four-manuals, 42 stops and 63 ranks. In 1992, the pedal division was expanded with a 32&#x27; Bombarde.

The organ replaced the earlier instrument that served the congregation from 1859. The earlier instrument was constructed by William Hill and Son in London to duplicate an organ given to the congregation by King George III and destroyed in the fire of 1856. The Hill instrument was remodeled and enlarged several on at least five occasions during the tenure of its service. In 1979, the congregation commissioned the mechanical organ and the earlier instrument was sold for parts.

===Promenades Cathédrale===

In the 1980s, a vast real estate project was undertaken below the cathedral. The project consisted of a 34-floor skyscraper, Tour KPMG, built north of the cathedral, underground parking, and two levels of retail stores situated beneath the cathedral. For a period in 1987, the cathedral was supported on stilts while footings for the underground mall, Promenades Cathédrale, were excavated. This project allowed for the linkage of the eastern and western branches of Montreal&#x27;s underground city, connecting the Eaton&#x27;s store (subsequently Complexe Les Ailes) and The Bay&#x27;s Henry Morgan Building.

==Canadian Grenadier Guards==
Christ Church Cathedral is the regimental church of the Canadian Grenadier Guards. The guards maintain their traditional ties with the church, as well as to McGill University, by marching from the Arts Building on campus, to the cathedral, annually in commemoration of Remembrance Day. The cathedral also houses the guards&#x27; retired regimental colours.

==L&#x27;Oasis musicale==
Every Saturday at 2pm throughout the year the cathedral hosts a series of free weekly concerts, &quot;L&#x27;Oasis musicale,&quot; which supports and promotes young aspiring musicians, many of whom are studying at music colleges in Montreal and starting out on their careers. The concerts are open to all. The concerts feature a range of musicians, from solo instrumentalists and singers to ensembles, small orchestras, and choirs. The repertoire is mainly classical music, but occasionally, popular, folk, religious, or traditional music is also played.

<doc id="613615" wikidata="Q862619" url="?curid=613615" title="Battle of Camlann">
<text>The Battle of Camlann ( or &quot;Brwydr Camlan&quot;) is the legendary final battle of King Arthur, in which Arthur either died or was mortally wounded while fighting either alongside or against Mordred, who also perished. The original legend of Camlann, inspired by a purportedly historical event said to have taken place in the early 6th-century Britain, is only vaguely described in several medieval Welsh texts dating from around the 10th century. The battle&#x27;s much more detailed depictions have emerged since the 12th century, generally based on that of a catastrophic conflict described in the pseudo-chronicle &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. The further greatly embellished variants originate from the later French chivalric romance tradition, in which it became known as the Battle of Salisbury, and include the 15th-century telling in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; that remains popular today.

==Etymology==
The name may derive from a Brittonic &quot;*Cambo-landa&quot; (&quot;crooked/twisting-enclosure&quot; or &quot;crooked/twisting open land&quot;), or (less likely) &quot;*Cambo-glanna&quot; (&quot;crooked/twisting bank (of a river)&quot;), as found in the name of the Roman fort of Camboglanna (Castlesteads) in Cumbria.

==Historicity==
The earliest dateable reference to the battle is found in the 10th-century Welsh annals &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;. An entry for the year 537 mentions the &quot;strife of Camlann, in which Arthur and Medraut fell, and there was great mortality in Britain and Ireland.&quot; This is also the first written mention of Medraut (the later Mordred), but it does not specify whether he and Arthur fought on the same side or who won the battle.

Andrew Breeze (2020) argues that the battle is historical, and it was an aftermath of the famine associated by the documented extreme weather events of 535–536, which caused, in the words of the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;, &quot;great mortality in Britain and Ireland&quot;. He interprets Camlann as a cattle raid on central Britain; Breeze cites R.G. Collingwood, to the effect that an identification of Camlann with &quot;Camboglanna on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall&quot; was &quot;convincing&quot;. Discussing further indications suggesting Camlann as Castlesteads, near Carlisle, Breeze concludes: &quot;There is every reason to think that, in 537, when the walls of this stronghold stood high [...], Arthur was killed [there] by men of Rheged, the British kingdom centred on Penrith.&quot; Flint Johnson disagrees with Breeze&#x27;s interpretation of Camlann as a cattle raid, but also agrees that the battle was historical and that the causes would have been political, although the date is still uncertain. Johnson concluded: &quot;The most reasonable reason why Arthur&#x27;s death was associated with 537 is because as a king he was associated with the fertility of his kingdom and 537 was a period of famine. It would have made perfect sense to a medieval scholar with a British cultural background that the death of a renowned king had caused [that].&quot;

However, most historians regard Arthur and the Battle of Camlann as legendary. Nick Higham argued that, as Camlann is not mentioned in the list of Arthur&#x27;s battles in the ninth-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, the source of the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; entry was probably an Old Welsh elegy or lament about a different Arthur, perhaps one listed in the genealogy of the kings of Dyfed.

==Legendary versions==

===Medieval Welsh tradition===
Besides the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot;, one of the earliest mentions of Camlann is found in the circa 9th/10th-century &quot;Englynion y Beddau&quot; (&quot;Stanzas of the Graves&quot;, Stanza 12) from the &quot;Black Book of Carmarthen&quot;, as the site of the grave of Osfran&#x27;s son. The Welsh prose text &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, dated to the 11th or 12th century, mentions the battle twice in connection to heroes who fought there. The text includes a triad naming Morfran ail Tegid, Sandde Bryd Angel, and Cynwyl Sant as the three men who survived Camlann: Morfran because of his fearsome ugliness, Sandde because of his angelic beauty, and Cynwyl because he left Arthur last. This triad shows that Camlann was famous as a battle that few survived. Caitlin Green suggests that &quot;Osfran&#x27;s son&quot; from the &quot;Englynion y Beddau&quot; is connected to Morfran from &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;. The text also mentions Gwyn Hywar, overseer of Cornwall and Devon, one of the nine men who plotted the Battle of Camlann, suggesting a now-lost tradition of complex intrigue underpinning Arthur&#x27;s last battle.

The Welsh Triads offer clues to the alleged cause of the Battle of Camlann. Triad 51 largely reflects (and is derived from) Geoffrey (see below): Medrawd (Mordred) rebels against Arthur while the latter is campaigning on the continent and usurps the throne, instigating the battle. Triad 53 lists a slap Gwenhwyvach gave to her sister Gwenhwyfar (Guinevere), wife of Arthur, as one of the &quot;Three Harmful Blows of the Island of Britain&quot;, causing the Strife of Camlann. Calling Camlann one of Britain&#x27;s &quot;Three Futile Battles&quot;, Triad 84 also mentions this dispute between sisters. Triad 54 describes Medrawd raiding Arthur&#x27;s court, throwing Gwenhwyfar to the ground and beating her. Other Triads in which Camlann is mentioned include Triad 30 (&quot;Three Faithless War Bands&quot;) and Triad 59 (&quot;Three Unfortunate Counsels&quot;).

Camlann is mentioned in Peniarth MS.37, a 14th-century copy of the Gwentian code of the Cyfraith Hywel (Welsh law), which (according to Peter Bartrum) shows that it was a topic familiar to Welsh writers. The law states &quot;when the queen shall will a song in the chamber, let the bard sing a song respecting Camlan, and that not loud, lest the hall be disturbed.&quot; The 15th/16th-century poet Tudur Aled says that the battle came about through the treachery of Medrod and happened &quot;about two nuts&quot;. In the 13th/14th-century Welsh tale &quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot;, the immediate cause of the battle is a deliberate provocation by Arthur&#x27;s rogue peace envoy named Iddawg (Iddawc Cordd Prydain) who intentionally insulted Medrawd.

===Chronicle tradition===
Geoffrey of Monmouth included the Battle of Camlann in his pseudo-historical chronicle &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, written circa 1136. Geoffrey&#x27;s version drew on existing Welsh tradition, but embellished the account with invented details. His focus was not on individuals but the &#x27;character of the British nation&#x27;. In Books X and IX, Arthur goes to war against the Roman leader Lucius Tiberius, leaving his nephew Modredus (Mordred) in charge of Britain. In Arthur&#x27;s absence, Modredus secretly marries Arthur&#x27;s wife Guenhuvara (Guinevere) and takes the throne for himself. Arthur returns and his army faces Modredus&#x27; at Camblana (the River Camel in Cornwall). Many are killed, including Modredus; Arthur is mortally wounded and taken to the Isle of Avalon to recover, passing the crown to his kinsman Constantine.

Geoffrey&#x27;s work was highly influential, and was adapted into various other languages, including Wace&#x27;s Anglo-Norman &quot;Roman de Brut&quot; (c. 1155), Layamon&#x27;s Middle English &quot;Brut&quot; (early 13th century), and the Welsh &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot; (mid-13th century). Various later works are based fairly closely on Geoffrey, including the Middle English Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;, written around 1400. The chronicle tradition typically follows Geoffrey in placing Camlann on the Camel in Cornwall: Wace places it at &quot;Camel, over against the entrance to Cornwall,&quot; and Layamon specifies the location as Camelford, where John Aubrey reports that as signs of the battle &quot;pieces of armour both for horse and man are many times found in digging of the ground&quot; in his &quot;Monumenta Britannica&quot; (1663–1693). In Layamon&#x27;s telling, only Arthur and his two nameless knights are left alive after the battle. Wace wrote: &quot;I neither know who lost, nor who gained that day. No man wists the name of overthrower or of overthrown. All alike are forgotten, the victor with him who died.&quot;

===Romance tradition===
Further traditions about Arthur&#x27;s final battle are developed in the Arthurian chivalric romances. These often follow Geoffrey&#x27;s blueprint, but alter many of the details. The legend shifts to the &#x27;character of individuals&#x27; and the proposed adultery between Guinevere and Lancelot is first mentioned.

In the Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot;, part of the French Lancelot-Grail (Vulgate) cycle, Arthur goes to France not to fight the Romans, but to pursue his former prime knight Lancelot, who had engaged in an affair with Guinevere and killed Arthur&#x27;s nephews (Mordred&#x27;s and Gawain&#x27;s siblings) Agravain, Gaheris and Gareth. He leaves Mordred in charge of Britain when he departs, only for Mordred to betray him and seize the throne. Arthur brings his veteran army back to Britain, where they meet Mordred&#x27;s forces outnumbering them two-to-one with his British supporters and foreign allies (Saxon and Irish) at Salisbury Plain in south central England (Camlann is not mentioned). The fighting begins by an accident of fate, when a startled knight draws his sword to kill an adder during the standoff negotiations between Mordred and Arthur. After great numbers die on both sides (including several other kings and most of the Knights of the Round Table remaining after the Grail Quest), Arthur kills Mordred in a duel, but is himself mortally wounded. The dying Arthur tasks his knight (depending on the telling, either Griflet or Bedivere) with returning his sword Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake, and he is then taken to Avalon. The &quot;Mort Artu&quot; narration laments that the brutal and bloody battle resulted in the deaths of so many that, afterwards, Arthur&#x27;s &quot;kingdom of Logres was doomed to destruction, and many others [in Britain] with it.&quot;

This account of Arthur&#x27;s last battle was adapted into many subsequent works of the period from 13th to 15th century, including the Old French Post-Vulgate Cycle (in which Arthur refuses to make peace with Mordred), the Middle English Stanzaic &quot;Morte Arthur&quot;, and Thomas Malory&#x27;s influential Middle English work &quot;Le Mort d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. These works almost all locate the battle at Salisbury. The &quot;Didot-Perceval&quot; uniquely locates it at a Saxon-ruled island in Ireland where Mordred had taken refuge while pursued by Arthur. In the Italian &quot;La Tavola Ritonda&quot;, Mordred is actually victorious as he survives Arthur&#x27;s death in their battle and then becomes the new king, only to be later defeated by Lancelot.

=== Avalon stories ===


In a popular motif, introduced by Geoffrey in &quot;Historia&quot; and elaborated in his later &quot;Vita Merlini&quot;, Arthur was then taken from the battlefield of Camlann to Avalon, an often otherworldly and magical isle, in hope that he could be saved. Geoffrey has Arthur delivered to Morgen (Morgan le Fay) in Avalon by Taliesin guided by Barinthus, replaced by two unnamed women in the &quot;Brut&quot;. Later authors of the prose cycles featured Morgan herself (usually with two or more other ladies with her) arriving in a fairy boat to take the king away, the scene made iconic through its inclusion in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;.

Some accounts, such as the Stanzaic &quot;Morte Arthur&quot; and the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot;, as well as the commentary by Gerald of Wales, declare that Arthur died in Avalon (identifying it as Glastonbury Tor) and has been buried there. Geoffrey gives only a hopeful possibility (but not assurance) for Arthur&#x27;s wounds to be healed eventually, but a successful revival of Arthur by Morgan is stated as a fact in the rewrite of Geoffrey in the &quot;Gesta Regum Britanniae&quot;; Wace and Layamon also tell this did happen, claiming that Arthur is about to return. Other versions, like the Vulgate &quot;Mort Artu&quot; and Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, do not give a definitive answer to Arthur&#x27;s ultimate fate.

<text>Lois-Ann Yamanaka (born September 7, 1961) is an American poet and novelist from Hawaii. Many of her literary works are written in Hawaiian Pidgin, and some of her writing has dealt with controversial ethnic issues. In particular, her works confront themes of Asian American families and the local culture of Hawaii.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Lois-Ann Yamanaka was born on September 7, 1961, in Hoolehua on the island of Molokai, Hawaii. Yamanaka&#x27;s parents, Harry and Jean Yamanaka, raised her and her four younger sisters in the sugarcane plantation town of Pahala on Hawaii Island. She graduated from Hilo High School in 1979.

Both parents were school teachers, although her father later became a taxidermist. In 1983, she received a bachelor’s Degree, and in 1987 her master&#x27;s degree, both in Education at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa.

===Career===
She then went on to become an English and Language Arts resource teacher. Inspired by her own students&#x27; honesty demonstrated within poetry assignments, she began writing on her own.

She completed her first book, Saturday Night at the Pahala Theater, in 1993, which, was described as &quot;&#x27;witty&#x27; and &#x27;street-smart&#x27;&quot; by Kiana Davenport in &quot;Women&#x27;s Review of Books&quot;. The novel, &quot;composed of four verse novellas narrated by working-class Hawaiian teenagers...explore[d] such subjects as ethnic identity, sexual awakening, drug use, and abusive relationships.&quot; Lawrence Chua, of the Voice Literary Supplement, wrote, &quot;Her poetry is enabled by its elegant structure as much as its indolent diction. &quot;Saturday Night&quot; is not a lonely specimen of street life but a bold push at the borders of meaning and memory.&quot; &quot;Saturday Night at the Pahala Theater&quot; received several awards including the Pushcart Prize for poetry and later, the fiction award given by the Association for Asian American Studies.

In 1996, Yamanaka’s second book, Wild Meat and the Bully Burgers, again told in Pidgin, was a coming-of-age story made up of &quot;a series of connected vignettes&quot; that &quot;examin[ed] larger issues of class and ethnicity&quot;. Lauren Belfer, of the &quot;New York Times Book Review,&quot; claimed the book to be &quot;somewhat impenetrable&quot; ... leaving &quot;haunting images&quot; in the minds of readers.

The next year, Yamanaka completed her third book, Blu’s Hanging &#x27;which created even more of an uproar among Asian American critics. As the novel treated characters of both Filipino and Japanese American backgrounds within the Hawaiian landscape, she was given the Asian American Studies National Book Award in 1998, however, it was annulled almost immediately for its use of stereotypical language. Other known Asian American authors such as Amy Tan and Maxine Hong Kingston emerged in support of Yamanaka during the controversy. The work was deemed, &quot;a well-wrought but painful work&quot; by Anna Quan Leon in the &quot;Library Journal.&quot; In defending herself, Yamanaka spoke out, telling &quot;Newsweek&quot; reporter Donna Foote that &#x27;the distinction between the narrator and the author is not being made&#x27;&quot;.

Following &quot;Blu&#x27;s Hanging&quot;, she published Heads by Harry, which dealt with gay sexuality and gender identity issues. The book received mixed reviews. &quot;To some extent, Yamanaka has replaced racism with sexism and homophobia, &#x27;safer topics&#x27;&quot;, concluded Nation reviewer Mindy Pennybacker. However, Michael Porter, of the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; applauded Yamanaka&#x27;s efforts, stating that &quot;[she] delivers a precise look at this vibrant &#x27;Japanese-American&#x27; culture yet still speaks to anyone who has experienced the joy, security and small humiliations of family life.&quot;

Name Me Nobody was her fourth book geared towards adolescents. In illustrating the difficulties of young &quot;teen hood&quot; and the surrounding superficialities, the &quot;&#x27;vignettes of young girlhood praised for their vivid images and expert distillation of language&quot;, related a Horn Book reviewer, &quot;Yamanaka provides young adult literature with a fresh and welcome voice &quot;noteworthy for its complexity and richness&#x27;.&quot;

In 2004, &quot;Silent Years&quot;, a short film based on Yamanaka&#x27;s screenplay was released. The story of a thirteen-year-old girl who finds herself caught between her abusive uncle and older boyfriend, it is based on two poems from her collection &quot;Saturday Night at the Pahala Theatre&quot; and has been described as &quot;brutal.&quot; The film was locally produced and directed by Honolulu native and University of Southern California film school graduate James Sereno.

In 2006, Yamanaka explored a spiritual approach in the novel, Behold the Many, set on the island of Oahu. In the book, a young woman is haunted by ghosts which ends in what a &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; contributor called a &quot;beautifully tragic&quot; outcome. Carol Haggas of &quot;Booklist&quot; wrote the book was a &quot;richly atmospheric novel which paints a chillingly spectral portrait of souls tormented by love and guilt.&quot;

The April 2007 issue of &quot;Honolulu Magazine&quot; featured an excerpt from Yamanaka&#x27;s upcoming novel, which had the working title of &quot;The Mother Mary Stories&quot;.

===Personal life===
As of 2009, Yamanaka is married to John Inferrera. They are both teachers. They have a son, John, Jr. and live in Honolulu, Hawaii. She is the co-owner of Na`au, a writing school.

===As an author===
&quot;Lois-Ann Yamanaka&#x27;s fiction focuses on young, working-class Japanese-Americans from Hawaii who struggle with such typical issues of adolescence as sexual development and peer acceptance while coming to terms with their cultural identity as the descendants of Japanese immigrant laborers.&quot;

&quot;Yamanaka once said,&#x27; My work involves bringing to the page the utter complexity, ferocious beauty and sometimes absurdity of our ethnic relationships here in the islands. The way we language about each other and with each other in &#x27;talk story&#x27; communities resonates in me with every word I write. I know this because as my friend Lisa Asagi says, &#x27;It&#x27;s impossible to ban the sound of memory&#x27;.&quot;

==Influences==
Yamanaka has stated that her characters &quot;know the sound of their own voice.&quot; She has drawn inspiration from her own experiences growing up amongst Hawaii life and culture, including the pidgin language. Yamanaka has attributed much of her work to the other authors who have inspired and influenced her, including: June Jordan, Ai, Thulani Davis, and Jessica Hagedorn; she describes them as major inspirations in terms of their use of voice in poetry.

She has described her experience of reading William Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; as humbling, and dubbed him a &quot;genius.&quot; She also stated that she considered herself privileged to be categorized amongst other female Asian American writers such as Maxine Hong Kingston and Amy Tan.

<text>Preston is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the City of Darebin local government area. Preston recorded a population of 33,790 at the 2021 census.

==History==
===19th century===
The area was first surveyed by Robert Hoddle in 1837. Parcels of land between 300 acres (in the southern area) and over 1000 acres (in the north) were all sold during the Melbourne &quot;land boom&quot; sales of the late 1830s.

The first permanent white resident was Samuel Jeffrey in 1841, and from him the area&#x27;s early name was Irishtown.

In 1850, Edward Wood, a settler from Sussex, England, opened a store at the corner of High Street and Wood Street, which was also the district&#x27;s first post office. Meeting at Wood&#x27;s store, members of the Ebenezer Church, Particular Baptist from Brighton, England met to change the name. They wanted to name the town after their former home in Sussex, but Brighton was already taken. Instead they named it after Preston, a small village nearby, where the church members had happy annual outings.

Preston Post Office opened on 1 March 1856.

The first church was accompanied by a growing number of hotels and other stores, which had emerged some 2 kilometres south of Wood&#x27;s store, at the junction of Plenty Road and High Street, the latter of which served as a route to Sydney. Throughout the 1880s the area between Wood&#x27;s Store and the junction would be known as &quot;Gowerville&quot;.

In April 1939, Vara Tidd, aged 91 years, who had lived in Preston since arriving with his family as a seven-year-old, recalled the early settlement:
&quot;He retains a wonderfully clear memory of the early days of Preston when the settlement was known as Irishtown. He can recall the camp of aborigines on the banks of the Darebin Creek and the old toll gate at Wood street Preston as well as the flour mill in the same street with Emery&#x27;s pottery behind the mill. Transport in those days was primitive and limited. The waggonette left the old Royal Mall Hotel in Bourke street.&quot;

====Post-Gold Rush====
1854 saw the establishment of the area&#x27;s first primary schools, an Anglican and a Wesleyan school. The first state school opened in 1866 to the east of the junction settlement, but was later joined by another, the Tyler Street School, which had opened in 1875, north-east of Wood&#x27;s store. The two denominational schools closed shortly before the Tyler Street School had opened.

During its formative years, Preston was heavily reliant on an abundance of fertile land for farming, dairying and market gardens. Areas that were not productive however, yielded clay for pottery and bricks. The 1860s saw the development of Preston&#x27;s industrial capacity, with a bacon-curing factory opening in 1862, followed by a tannery in 1865. These original establishments would be followed by several larger factories, including Huttons Hams and Bacons and Zwar&#x27;s Parkside Tannery.

By the 1860s, the area had a population of around 200, and five hotels, three of which survive: The Preston Hotel (1856), The Junction (1861), and the Rose Shamrock (1854) in nearby Reservoir.

A railway line reached Preston in 1889, with the Collingwood to Whittlesea line passing through. The new line provided stations at Bell Street, Regent Street, Reservoir and centrally in Preston.

Throughout the 1880s, Preston with its abundance of land and newly built rail stations was marketed as a residential area, capable of supporting 20,000 inhabitants. Between 1887 and 1891, Preston&#x27;s population nearly doubled from 2,000 to 3,600. The majority of residential development took place within the corridor contained by Plenty Road and High Street, however there was also limited development in the west of the town, along Gilbert Road. These areas would remain areas of growth well into the 20th Century.

===Urban growth===

Urban growth accelerated in Preston during the 1920s, thanks largely to the establishment of a direct rail link between Collingwood and Flinders Street in 1904 (later electrified in 1926), and a building of a tram line to the Melbourne central business district in 1920. The Preston Workshops would later be built in 1925 by the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board. The reticulation of electricity took place in 1914, with the building of Preston&#x27;s sewers taking place between 1909 and 1915. 1915 also saw the establishment of the West Preston Primary School, which by 1927 had grown to accommodate more than 1,000 students. West Preston Primary School would later be joined by a primary school in Preston East in 1927, and later by a girl&#x27;s high school in 1929. By 1922, Preston had been formally recognised as a Borough, two months later it had become a Town, and finally by 1926, Preston had been proclaimed a City.

With the 1930s and the Great Depression came economic hardship for Preston. However, capital works projects, which included the designation of new parks and reserves and the paving of roads, helped attract new residents to the area. Preston bucked the economic status quo by recording rapid growth between the period 1933 and 1947, with the population growing by some 40%. This growth also resulted in the establishment of a technical school in 1937, which would later become a campus of the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE. A notable highlight for Preston residents during the era of depression was VFL legend Roy (&quot;Up There&quot;) Cazaly&#x27;s coaching of the local football team.

Two World Wars provided Preston with two awardees of the Victoria Cross – the Empire&#x27;s highest military award for valour; Bruce Kingsbury and William Ruthven, both of whom lent their name to future localities.

The post war period would also see Preston experience rapid growth. Between 1947 and 1954, the population grew by 37%, topping 64,000. A 15-year joint vision between the Preston and Northcote Councils would later culminate in 1958, with the construction of the Preston &amp; Northcote Community Hospital (PANCH). This period also saw the construction of some 2,600 Housing Commission of Victoria dwellings which continued up to 1966, by which time said dwellings accommodated approximately 11% of Preston population.

The acquisition of former Housing Commission land by the Myer Emporium led to the opening of the Northland Shopping Centre in 1966.

Currently, the suburb of Preston exists to the south of the original Preston municipal area. Suburbs which were once part of this include: Reservoir, Ruthven, Keon Park and Kingsbury.

==Geography==

Preston is bordered to the east by the Darebin Creek, a small tributary to the Yarra River and consists largely of flat terrain, ideal initially for farming, but later for industrial and residential development.

The original abundance of land resulted in low density urban development of Preston&#x27;s former farmland, however population pressures and Preston&#x27;s locality with respect to the Melbourne CBD has led to a growing tendency to medium to high-density urban redevelopment.

==Population==
Preston&#x27;s Census populations have been 623 (1861), 3,563 (1891) and 6,555 (1921). The Preston Municipality&#x27;s Census populations were 5,049 (1911), 33,442 (1933), 46,775 (1947), 84,146 (1961) and 76,996 (1991).

The three postwar decades saw an influx of Macedonian immigrants into the Preston area, later followed by Asian refugees in the 1980s. By 1986, some 30% of the population was foreign born.

In Preston, 63.8% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were China (excludes SARs and Taiwan) 3.0%, Italy 3.0%, Greece 2.8%, India 2.5% and Vietnam 2.2%.

The most common responses for religion in Preston were No Religion, so described 34.8%, Catholic 22.1%, Not stated 10.4%, Eastern Orthodox 10.1% and Islam 5.6%. In Preston, Christianity was the largest religious group reported overall (46.3%) (this figure excludes not stated responses).

In Preston, 54.0% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek 6.7%, Italian 6.0%, Mandarin 3.9%, Arabic 3.1% and Vietnamese 2.9%.

==Governance==

Preston is part of the City of Darebin local government area, whose offices are located at the former Preston Town Hall. Preston lay within the federal Division of Cooper which is the current seat of Ged Kearney, a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP). The division was formerly called the Division of Batman. At the 2019 federal election, the division was renamed in honour of Aboriginal activist William Cooper. In the Legislative Assembly, the lower house of the Parliament of Victoria, the State Electoral district of Preston incorporates some of Preston (and most parts of Reservoir), and is currently represented by Nathan Lambert, of the ALP. The state Electoral district of Northcote incorporates the rest of Preston, specifically all of the suburb south of Bell Street and is currently represented by Kat Theophanous of the ALP.

==Arts and entertainment==

As part of the City of Darebin, Preston has an active and eclectic artists and DIY community which is contemporary, experimental, and culturally diverse. Writers, musicians, and visual artists flock to the locality for performance, collaboration, and acceptance. Notable contributors to the Darebin arts community are locals Saint Jude, Downhills Home, The Contrast, The Melbourne Ukulele Kollective, Performing Older Women&#x27;s Circus (POW Circus), Darebin City Brass, and members of Little John, to name a few. Darebin celebrates the artistry and diversity of the community with regular festivals and events such as the Darebin Music Feast and the now-defunct High Vibes Festival. The major community Indigenous Radio Station 3KND is located in Mary Street in Preston and is completely Aboriginal managed.

The 2001 film &quot;Mallboy&quot; is set in Preston, specifically the Northland Shopping Centre and surrounding streets.

A Preston house viewing inspired the song &quot;Depreston&quot; by musician Courtney Barnett on her album &quot;Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit&quot;, which was recorded at Head Gap Studio in Preston.

==Sports==
Preston has been home to the Preston Bullants Australian rules football (later known as the Northern Blues and currently as the Northern Bullants) club since its inception in 1882. West Preston Football Club is also located in Preston. The suburb also has many junior football teams, including the Northern Knights, who play in the TAC Cup and the Preston Bullants Junior Football Club, whose home ground is the Preston City Oval. The Darebin Falcons Women&#x27;s Australian rules football team play in the VWFL. The Falcons were first division premiers in 2006 and 2007.

In 2007, the Lions finished the season as Minor Premiers and then went on to claim the Championship in front of more than 5,500 people, as the Lions won 3–1 against the Whittlesea Zebras.

Ruthven Reserve in East Preston has recently been upgraded, with arguably the best social and training amenities of any local sporting venue in the area.

There are few large grounds around the Northland Shopping Centre, adjacent to Wood Street. Grounds are maintained very well, and people play cricket in summer and footy during other times. Joggers are visible in all grounds.

<doc id="613620" wikidata="Q1768716" url="?curid=613620" title="The Daleks">
<text>The Daleks (also known as The Mutants and The Dead Planet is the second serial in the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast on BBC TV in seven weekly parts from 21 December 1963 to 1 February 1964. Written by Terry Nation and directed by Christopher Barry and Richard Martin, this story marks the first appearance of the show&#x27;s most popular villains, the Daleks, and the recurring Skaro people, the Thals.

In the serial, the First Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford), and her teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) land in an alien jungle and are captured by the Daleks, a race of mutated creatures who survive off the radiation that remains in the atmosphere after a nuclear war with their enemies. As the group attempt to escape the Daleks, they discover more about the planet and the ensuing war, and attempt to broker a peace.

&quot;The Daleks&quot; was originally commissioned by script editor David Whitaker, having seen Nation&#x27;s other writing work. Nation wrote a story outline, influenced by the threat of racial extermination by the Nazis. Whitaker and producer Verity Lambert were impressed, despite disapproval from the show&#x27;s creator Sydney Newman, who wanted to avoid serials with &quot;bug-eyed monsters&quot;. Barry directed several episodes of &quot;The Daleks&quot;, trailed by Martin who directed three episodes due to Barry&#x27;s other commitments. The Daleks were designed by Raymond Cusick, and underwent several iterations, while the Dalek voices were achieved using a ring modulator.

The serial premiered with seven million viewers, and audiences grew as news about the Daleks spread; the show&#x27;s overall audience increased by 50% after the final episode. It received generally positive reviews, with praise for Nation&#x27;s script, although several reviewers criticised its length. It later received several print adaptations, as well as home media and soundtrack releases, and was adapted into a feature film starring Peter Cushing. A 75-minute colourised version was broadcast in 2023 for the programme&#x27;s 60th anniversary.

== Plot ==
The TARDIS lands in a petrified jungle, where the First Doctor (William Hartnell) tries to determine their position by taking a reading of the stars. He insists they explore a futuristic city they spot beyond the forest, but Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) are not convinced. In the forest, someone touches Susan Foreman&#x27;s (Carole Ann Ford) shoulder; the Doctor does not believe her. Later, a box of vials is found outside the TARDIS. The Doctor claims the fluid link of the TARDIS is running low on mercury (a ruse he later admits to), forcing the crew to travel to the city in search of more mercury.

Barbara becomes separated from her colleagues in the city and is threatened by an unseen creature with a metal arm. Before long, the entire crew is captured by unseen creatures operating tank-like machines, the Daleks. Susan is eventually sent to retrieve anti-radiation drugs from the TARDIS after the Doctor realises this is what the box contained. Susan encounters a second species, the Thals, who used to be at war with the Daleks. The Thal who left the drugs reveals he encountered her in the forest. Susan attempts to broker peace between the two groups, and while it appears to work, the Daleks eventually betray the Thals, opening fire on them at what was supposed to be a peaceful exchange of food. The Daleks attempt using the anti-radiation drugs, but discover that they are fatal to Daleks. They conclude that Daleks need radiation to survive and decide to bombard the atmosphere with more radiation.

In the ensuing chaos, the Doctor and his companions escape with the Thals, and learn their version of the history of their planet. They also learn that the Thals are avowed pacifists. They are unable to leave Skaro, however, as the fluid link has been taken by the Daleks. In order to save them from the Daleks, the TARDIS crew convinces the Thals of the importance of aggression and warfare, and manages to lead the Thals in a successful attack against the Daleks. At the end, it is believed the Dalek race has been destroyed when their power supply is knocked out. The TARDIS crew leave Skaro, but an explosion in the TARDIS knocks them out.

== Production ==
=== Conception and writing ===
The second serial of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was always planned to be futuristic, due to the historical nature of the first serial, &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;. In July 1963, the serial was titled &quot;Doctor Who and the Robots&quot;, to be written by Anthony Coburn and directed by Rex Tucker; the latter was also set to direct the fourth serial, &quot;Doctor Who and the Mutants&quot;, for which script editor David Whitaker commissioned comedy writer Terry Nation on 31 July, impressed by his work in the science-fiction series &quot;Out of This World&quot;. Nation had written a 26-page outline for a story entitled &quot;The Survivors&quot; at his home, influenced by the threat of racial extermination by the Nazis and the concerns of advanced warfare, as well as taking influences from H. G. Wells&#x27; novel &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1895). Impressed by the outline, producer Verity Lambert extended the serial from six to seven episodes on 8 August, to better express Nation&#x27;s story.

Show creator Sydney Newman and head of serials Donald Wilson were unhappy with the serial, having wanted to avoid featuring &quot;bug-eyed monsters&quot;; however, with no other scripts prepared, they were forced to accept the serial for production. The serial was later brought forward to the second in broadcast order. Due to other sudden commitments, Nation quickly wrote the scripts for the serial at the rate of one per day. On 16 September, following Tucker&#x27;s departure from the show, Christopher Barry was appointed to direct the serial. Lambert&#x27;s original choice for director was Richard Martin, but Wilson wanted Barry to remain in charge. However, Barry&#x27;s other work commitments led to a compromise by the production team: Barry would direct the early episodes of the serial, and Martin would trail him to gain more experience. The serial went through a number of working titles during production, including &quot;The Survivors&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Sun&quot;, before settling as &quot;The Mutants&quot; towards the end of production.

=== Design and music ===
The designer originally assigned to this serial was Ridley Scott, later a famed film director. However, a problem with Scott&#x27;s schedule meant that he was replaced by Raymond Cusick, who was thus given the task of realising the Dalek creatures. Cusick based the design of the Daleks on a man sitting in a chair. Cusick&#x27;s original design was tubular, with a plain skirt section, bumpy midriff with one pincer arm, and a short head with an eye-lens; Lambert rejected this design as being too expensive. It was decided that the designs should be more comfortable for the actors, allowing them to be seated. Cusick&#x27;s second design was shorter, with a diamond-patterned body and larger head, and two double-jointed claw arms; one of the arms was replaced by a suction cup, due to the low budget of the production. The design was refined to fit over a small tricycle, and the arms were moved further down to allow the operator to see out of a metal gauze above the midriff. Lights were added to the dome to indicate which Dalek was speaking, as suggested by Barry.

Shawcraft Models—who had designed parts of the TARDIS set—worked with Cusick to design the Daleks; when Cusick met with Shawcraft&#x27;s Bill Roberts to discuss the project, he used a pepper pot to demonstrate the Daleks&#x27; movements. The prototype (known internally as &quot;Shawcraft One&quot;) had a wooden base, with the skirt section made using fibreglass. It stood at four-foot six-inches, allowing a small seated actor inside. The BBC approved of Shawcraft&#x27;s designs, allowing three weeks for the final models. While Cusick wanted six Daleks, the £500 budget only allowed for four. The final models stood at four-foot eight-inches, painted in silver with grey trimmings, and light blue balls on the skirt; the lights on the domes were Christmas tree lights covered by a ping-pong ball, operated by the actor inside.

Nation once claimed that he came up with the name &quot;Dalek&quot; after seeing a set of encyclopedias with one volume spanning the section of the alphabet from &quot;Dal – Lek&quot;. However, he later admitted that this was a story for the press, and that he had just made up the name. Barry commissioned Tristram Cary to provide the serial&#x27;s incidental score, having worked together on &quot;No Cloak — No Dagger&quot;; while Newman disliked Cary&#x27;s work, Barry and Lambert convinced him otherwise. Barry had heard some &quot;musique concrète&quot; music and, intrigued by it, asked Cary to compose a strange and simplistic electronic score for the serial. About twenty minutes of music was used in the serial.

=== Casting and characters ===
Actor Alan Wheatley was chosen to portray Temmosus, the leader of the Thals, having worked with Hartnell in an episode of &quot;The Flying Doctor&quot; in 1959; David Markham was originally considered for the role. Virginia Wetherell was cast as the female Thal named Dyoni, having previously worked with Martin. Dinsdale Landen was chosen to play Ganatus, but production date changes forced him to drop out of the serial; he was replaced by Philip Bond, with whom Barry had worked on &quot;No Cloak — No Dagger&quot;. The names of the Thals were revised in the final script: Temmosus was originally Stohl, Alydon was Vahn, Ganatus was Kurt, Kristas was Jahl, Antodus was Ven, Dyoni was Daren, and Elyon was Zhor. Four actors were chosen as Dalek operators, due to their small stature and muscular ability: Robert Jewell, Kevin Manser, Michael Summerton, and Gerald Taylor; Barry knew Manser as a sensitive actor who reacted well to voices, while Martin knew Taylor through repertory theatre. Due to the Daleks&#x27; electronic voices, it was considered impractical for the actors inside the machines to also deliver the dialogue. As a result, the Dalek voices were performed off-set by Peter Hawkins and David Graham. Barry contacted the Post Office&#x27;s Joint Speech Research Unit for information on electronic voices. Two samples were provided: one using a vocoder with low and medium monotone pitch; and one using written computer characters, generating a sound which was less human but more time-consuming. While Barry enjoyed these methods, the BBC opted to develop its own method to achieve a similar effect, as some of the Dalek speech was required in studio during production. Martin worked with Brian Hodgson of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop to find suitable tones; ultimately, the actors spoke through a lip-ribbon microphone, which was later given an electronic quality after passing through a ring modulator.

=== Filming ===
A week of shooting took place from 28 October 1963, consisting mostly of inserts of the city and models. Rehearsals for the cast began on 11 November; Nation only attended one session, due to work commitments. Some of the Dalek dialogue was pre-recorded on 13 November by Hawkins and Graham, portraying the higher-pitched &quot;Dalek One&quot; and lower-pitched &quot;Dalek Two&quot;, respectively. Weekly recording of the serial began on 15 November; it was later discovered that the first recording was affected by induction—an effect in which the voices from the production assistants&#x27; headphones was clearly audible. The episode was re-recorded on 6 December, pushing the weekly recordings of episodes 4–7 back by one week. The final episode was recorded on 10 January 1964.

== Reception ==
=== Broadcast and ratings ===

The first episode was broadcast on BBC TV on 21 December 1963, and was watched by 6.9 million viewers. The following episode received 6.4 million viewers. By the third episode, news about the Daleks had spread, and the episode was watched by 8.9 million viewers. An additional million viewers watched for the following two weeks, and the final two episodes reached 10.4 million; by the end of the serial, the show&#x27;s overall audience had increased by 50%. To date, the serial has been repeated twice on the BBC: the final episode was broadcast on BBC Two late in the evening on 13 November 1999 as part of &quot;Doctor Who Night&quot;, garnering 1.6 million viewers; and the serial was shown in three blocks from 5–9 April 2008 on BBC Four, as part of a celebration of the life and work of Lambert following her death in November 2007.

BBC Enterprises prepared to dispose of the 16mm telerecordings of the serial in 1978. When this was discovered by fan Ian Levine and BBC Enterprises Film Sales employee John Bridger, they contacted Sue Malden of BBC Archives to request that the destruction of &quot;The Daleks&quot;, and all other remaining 1960s Doctor Who serials, should cease. Subsequently, the remaining film prints were relocated to the BBC archives for preservation. A further copy of the fifth episode of the serial was discovered in the private collection of former BBC employee Francis Watson and returned to the BBC in 2004.

=== Critical response ===
Following the broadcast of the fifth episode, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;″s Richard Sear described the show as &quot;splendid children&#x27;s stuff&quot;, describing the cliffhanger as &quot;smashing&quot;. Retrospective reviews were also positive. In &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping described the serial as &quot;brilliantly directed, full of inventive touches and wonderful set-pieces&quot;; they noted that the first four episodes helped to launch &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to success, but wrote that the last three &quot;comprise a B-movie trek through hideous landscapes&quot;, comparing it unfavourably to Flash Gordon. In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker praised the serial for introducing the Daleks and lauded Cusick&#x27;s designs, but felt that the Thals—particularly after the death of their leader Temmosus in the fourth episode—were &quot;faceless stereotypes&quot; used only for plot, and criticised their costume design. In &quot;A Critical History of Doctor Who&quot; (1999), John Kenneth Muir similarly praised the Daleks, as well as Barry&#x27;s &quot;stylish&quot; direction and the performances of Hill and Hartnell. In 2006, &quot;DVD Talk&quot; John Sinnott, despite noting that &quot;there are a few parts that drag just a bit&quot;, commended the script for allowing the characters to develop and holding tension unlike the previous serial. In 2008, Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; praised the strength of Nation&#x27;s scripts, particularly the first three cliffhangers, but felt that &quot;the urgency and claustrophobia dissipate towards the end&quot;, describing the final battle as &quot;a disappointingly limp affair&quot;. In 2011, Christopher Bahn of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that the serial is &quot;quite solid, full of well-paced action and some interestingly subtle characterizations, though it definitely begins to drag around the fifth episode, with a long trek through swamps and caverns that moves the plot forward by about an inch&quot;.

== Commercial releases ==
The story was originally released on VHS on 5 June 1989, with a photomontage cover. A remastered version of the serial was released on VHS on 26 February 2001 under the title &quot;Doctor Who: The Daleks (Remastered)&quot;. For the DVD release on 30 January 2006, the serial was released as part of &quot;Doctor Who: The Beginning&quot; alongside the first and third serials, with several special features, including audio commentary by the production team and a documentary on the creation of the Daleks.

&quot;The Daleks&quot; was the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial to be adapted as a novel. Written by David Whitaker, the book was first published in hardback on 12 November 1964 by Frederick Muller Ltd as &quot;Doctor Who in an Exciting Adventure with the Daleks&quot;. A paperback release by Armada Books followed in October 1965 with a new cover and interior illustrations by Peter Archer. Two international versions of the book were released in 1966: a Dutch hardback edition, &quot;Dr Who en de Daleks&quot;, was translated by Tuuk Buijtenhuijs; and American and Canadian hardback editions were licensed to Soccer Books and Saunders, respectively. In July 1967, a North American paperback was published by Avon Books, featuring a photomontage cover by Paul Weller.

In 1972, Universal-Tandem Publishing acquired the rights to republish the title as part of the new Target Books range. Renamed &quot;Doctor Who and the Daleks&quot;, the book was published on 2 May 1973 with a new cover painting of Hartnell. The release also received several translations worldwide. A new version by Virgin Books titled &quot;Doctor Who – The Daleks&quot;, featuring a cover by Alister Pearson, was issued on 16 January 1992, and a reproduction of the Target book was published on 7 July 2011 with a cover by Chris Achilleos and foreword by fantasy author Neil Gaiman. An illustrated version of the book, with art from Robert Hack, was released on 3 November 2022.

A verbatim transcript of the transmitted version of the serial, edited by John McElroy, was published by Titan Books in December 1989, and reissued in 1992. An audiobook reading of the novelisation, narrated by William Russell, was published by BBC Audiobooks on CD on 7 March 2005, and later reissued on the five-CD set &quot;Doctor Who: Travels in Time and Space&quot; on 7 November 2005.

=== Soundtrack ===
Cary&#x27;s music from this serial was first released on CD as part of &quot;Doctor Who: Devils&#x27; Planets – The Music of Tristram Cary&quot; by BBC Music on 1 September 2003. The music also received an individual CD release, along with sounds by Hodgson and the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, on 15 September 2017.

== Film version ==
In 1965, the serial was adapted by Milton Subotsky as a film, &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot;, starring Peter Cushing as Dr. Who, Roberta Tovey as Susan, Roy Castle as Ian Chesterton and Jennie Linden as Barbara. The film also received a sequel in 1966, &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot;, based on the 1964 serial &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;.

== &quot;The Daleks in Colour&quot; ==
A 75-minute colourised version of the serial, titled &quot;The Daleks in Colour&quot;, was announced on 2 November 2023, to celebrate &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s 60th anniversary. It features a new score by Mark Ayres, original sound design, and new material written by incumbent showrunner Russell T Davies and recorded by original Dalek voice actor David Graham. Among the new material written by Davies was &quot;Exterminate!&quot;, the Daleks&#x27; famous battle cry missing from the original story. Davies sought to colourise old &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials shortly after returning the role of showrunner in early 2022, considering himself &quot;the curator of a museum in some sense&quot;. &quot;The Daleks in Colour&quot; was edited by Benjamin Cook.

Rich Tipple led the project as lead colourisation artist after &quot;Doctor Who&quot; executive producers Joel Collins and Phil Collinson saw his fan-made work on YouTube. Production began in November 2022 and ran for ten months; Tipple was joined by Timothy K. Brown, Scott Burditt, and Kieran Highman. Characters had individual colour palettes, and each team member was allocated a different location for consistency: Tipple oversaw the Dalek city, Brown the TARDIS control room, Burditt the caves, and Highman the jungle. The team sought to honour the original serial while making it appealing to new viewers.

Colour photographs from the original filming were consulted but creative license was encouraged; instead of imitating the original sets, the team sought to create a version &quot;if &quot;Doctor Who&quot; had original &quot;Star Trek&quot; money to produce something in colour, on colour cameras&quot;. Discussions were required for some colours, such as the TARDIS console, which was painted green during filming to avoid camera flare but intended to look white, and Barbara&#x27;s shirt, which was originally blue but made pink in the colourisation to avoid poor contrast. Some changes included Skaro&#x27;s red sky becoming green in the evenings.

&quot;The Daleks in Colour&quot; aired on BBC Four on 23 November to 350,000 overnight and 499,000 consolidated viewers, before becoming available on BBC iPlayer. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray, alongside the original seven-part serial, on 12 February 2024 in the United Kingdom, 19 March in the United States, and 4 September in Australia. It was also available as a SteelBook release. &quot;The Telegraph&quot;″s Tristram Fane Saunders complimented the editing, and praised the original serial&#x27;s production design, cinematography, and score. &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot;″s Adi Tantimedh lauded the faster pacing for heightening performances and characterisation, though found some cuts too abrupt, flashbacks unnecessary, and picture quality unstable. &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot;″s Andrew Gladman considered Ayres score &quot;a driving force&quot; for the story&#x27;s faster pace.

=== Soundtrack ===
Ayres composed the score for &quot;The Daleks in Colour&quot;. While the production team originally considered a full re-score, Ayres insisted that Cary&#x27;s original work be retained, as he was friends with Cary and Hodgson. He sought his work to be &quot;both celebration and reinvention: respectful to the original, while not entirely reverential&quot;. A soundtrack of &quot;The Daleks in Colour&quot;, featuring Cary and Ayres&#x27;s work, was released by Silva Screen Records on 13 September 2024, on digital platforms and as a two-disc set. The first disc features the soundtrack from the serial, while the second (exclusive to the physical release) features unused and alternate tracks.

<doc id="613622" wikidata="Q50650" url="?curid=613622" title="NGC 55">
<text>NGC 55, also known as the String of Pearls Galaxy, is a Magellanic type barred spiral galaxy located about 6.5 million light-years away in the constellation Sculptor. It was discovered on 7 July 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop. Along with its neighbor NGC 300, it is one of the closest galaxies to the Local Group, probably lying between the Milky Way and the Sculptor Group. It has an estimated mass of (2.0 ± 0.4) × 1010 .

==Nearby galaxies and group information==
NGC 55 and the spiral galaxy NGC 300 have traditionally been identified as members of the Sculptor Group, a nearby group of galaxies in the constellation of the same name. However, recent distance measurements indicate that the two galaxies actually lie in the foreground.

It is likely that NGC 55 and NGC 300 form a gravitationally bound pair.

==Visual appearance==
The &quot;Webb Society Deep-Sky Observer&#x27;s Handbook&quot; writes the following about NGC 55: &quot;Nearly edge-on and appears asymmetrical with some signs of dust near the bulge, which is diffuse, broad and somewhat elongated with the south edge sharp; southeast of the bulge it is strongly curved and lined with 4 or 5 faint knots; north edge of the curve is sharp.&quot; Burnham calls it &quot;one of the outstanding galaxies of the southern heavens&quot;, somewhat resembling a smaller version of the Large Magellanic Cloud. In September 1897, the famous New York comet hunter Lewis Swift observed the galaxy from Echo Mountain, California with a 16-inch refractor. He mistook the galaxy&#x27;s faint eastern section as a new find (even though John Herschel had drawn it) and that is how it got cataloged as IC 1537.

<text>Thomas Shepard (5 November 1605 – 25 August 1649) was an English, afterwards American Puritan minister and a significant figure in early colonial New England.

==Life==

Shepard was born in Towcester, Northamptonshire. His devout mother died when he was four and he lived a difficult life under his stepmother. His father died when he reached ten, at which point he lived with his grandparents and later an older brother, whom he held in high and grateful regard. A schoolmaster ignited in him a scholarly interest, which ultimately led to entry into Emmanuel College in Cambridge University at the age of fifteen. He accounts in his autobiography that he lived a dissatisfied and dissolute life, which led him to pray out in a nearby field, at which point he underwent the beginnings of a conversion experience. 

In 1627 he became assistant schoolmaster at Earls Colne Grammar School in Earls Colne, Essex. He became a minister whose sermons and Puritan ways drew the ire of Church of England Archbishop William Laud, and he was forbidden to preach. Following the death of his elder son, he left England in 1635 with his wife and younger son on a difficult voyage on the ship Defence for Massachusetts in colonial America where he became minister of one of the leading churches in the colonies, the First Church in Cambridge (Congregational, currently UCC), Massachusetts and also of Harvard University, then a very new school charged with training men for the Christian ministry in the Puritan colonies of New England. From 1637 to 1638, during the Antinomian Controversy, he sat with the other colonial ministers during both the civil and church trials of Anne Hutchinson, and was a very vocal critic of hers during the latter. His wife died shortly after his arrival in New England, as did his second wife and other children, though he framed these experiences, if not without difficulty, into the perspective of his theology. 

Along with John Allin and John Eliot, he was involved in preaching to the native peoples on New England.

Shepard died of quinsy, a Peritonsillar abscess, which is a complication of tonsillitis at the age of 44.

==Legacy==

Shepard was regarded as one of the foremost Puritan ministers of his day, esteemed in the company of individuals like Richard Mather and John Cotton. He took special interest in Puritan ministry to the Massachusetts Native Americans. His written legacy includes an autobiography and numerous sermons, which in some measure of contrast with others of his day, tended to accent God as an accessible and welcoming figure in the individual life. Today a plaque at Harvard University, in the words of Cotton Mather, records that it was in consideration of the salutary effect of Shepard&#x27;s ministry that the college ultimately came to be placed in &quot;Newtowne&quot;, known today as Cambridge, Massachusetts. 

While Thomas Shepard ministered nearly a century and a half before the Congregational/Unitarian split, both First Parish in Cambridge and First Church in Cambridge Congregational consider him to be their founding minister. While it is difficult to judge in a modern context with which church Shepard would have maintained an affiliation, it is safe to say that his trinitarian beliefs would have aligned him with the Congregationalists not the Unitarians. Thus any portrayal of Shepard must take into account his theological convictions when placing him in a congregation&#x27;s lineage that was merely a permutation of dissatisfied Unitarian Congregationalists. 

Three of Shepard&#x27;s sons followed him into the ministry; Thomas Shepard II, Samuel Shepard, and Jeremiah Shepard. Thomas Shepard II was an ancestor of U.S. Presidents John Quincy Adams and Franklin D. Roosevelt.

<text>Spin (stylized in all caps as SPIN) is an American music magazine founded in 1985 by publisher Bob Guccione Jr. Now owned by Next Management Partners, the magazine is an online publication since it stopped issuing a print edition in 2012. It returned as a quarterly publication in September 2024.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

&quot;Spin&quot; was established in 1985 by Bob Guccione, Jr. In August 1987, the publisher announced it would stop publishing &quot;Spin&quot;, but Guccione Jr. retained control of the magazine and partnered with former MTV president David H. Horowitz to quickly revive the magazine. During this time, it was published by Camouflage Publishing with Guccione Jr. serving as president and chief executive and Horowitz as investor and chairman.

In its early years, &quot;Spin&quot; was known for its narrow music coverage, with an emphasis on college rock, grunge, indie rock, and the ongoing emergence of hip-hop, while virtually ignoring other genres, such as country and metal. It also pointedly provided a national alternative to &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; more establishment-oriented style. &quot;Spin&quot; prominently placed rising acts such as R.E.M., Prince, Run-D.M.C., Beastie Boys, and Talking Heads on its covers and did lengthy features on established figures such as Duran Duran, Keith Richards, Miles Davis, Aerosmith, Tom Waits, and John Lee Hooker.

On a cultural level, the magazine devoted significant coverage to punk, alternative country, electronica, reggae and world music, experimental rock, jazz of the most adventurous sort, burgeoning underground music scenes, and a variety of fringe styles. Artists such as the Ramones, Patti Smith, Blondie, X, Black Flag, and the former members of the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and the early punk and New Wave movements were heavily featured in &quot;Spin&quot;″s editorial mix. &quot;Spin&quot;″s extensive coverage of hip-hop music and culture, especially that of contributing editor John Leland, was notable at the time.

Editorial contributions by musical and cultural figures included Lydia Lunch, Henry Rollins, David Lee Roth and Dwight Yoakam. The magazine also reported on cities such as Austin, Texas, and Glasgow, Scotland, as cultural incubators in the independent music scene. A 1990 article on the contemporary country blues scene brought R. L. Burnside to national attention for the first time. Coverage of American cartoonists, manga, monster trucks, the AIDS crisis, outsider artists, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, and other non-mainstream cultural phenomena distinguished the magazine&#x27;s early years. In July 1986, &quot;Spin&quot; published an exposé by Robert Keating on how the funds raised at the Live Aid concert might have been inappropriately used. Beginning in January 1988, &quot;Spin&quot; published a monthly series of articles about the AIDS epidemic titled &quot;Words from the Front&quot;.

In 1990, &quot;Spin&quot; hired John Skipper in the new position of publishing director and president while Guccione, Jr. continued to serve as editor and publisher. In the early 1990s, &quot;Spin&quot; played an influential role on the grunge era, featuring alternative rock artists such as &quot;Nirvana and PJ Harvey on its covers when more mainstream magazines often failed to acknowledge them&quot;.

In 1994, two journalists working for the magazine were killed by a landmine while reporting on the Bosnian War in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A third, William T. Vollmann, was injured.

In 1997, Guccione Jr. left the magazine after selling &quot;Spin&quot; to Miller Publishing for $43.3 million. The new owner appointed Michael Hirschorn as editor-in-chief. A partnership made up of Robert Miller, David Salzman, and Quincy Jones, Miller Publishing also owned &quot;Vibe&quot;, which together made up Vibe/Spin Ventures. In 1999, Alan Light, who previously served as editor of &quot;Vibe&quot; succeeded Hirschorn at &quot;Spin&quot;.

===Later years ===
Sia Michel was appointed editor-in-chief in early 2002 to succeed Light. With Michel as editor, according to Evan Sawdey of &quot;PopMatters&quot;, &quot;&quot;Spin&quot; was one of the most funny, engaging music publications out there, capable of writing about everyone from the Used to Kanye West with an enthusiasm and deep-seated knowledge in genre archetypes that made for page-turning reading&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Spin&quot; sent Chuck Klosterman, a senior writer who joined the magazine in the 1990s, on a trip to visit the death sites of famous artists in rock music, which became the basis of his 2005 book, &quot;Killing Yourself to Live: 85% of a True Story&quot;. Klosterman wrote for &quot;Spin&quot; until 2006.

In February 2006, Miller Publishing sold the magazine to a San Francisco-based company called the McEvoy Group LLC, which was also the owner of Chronicle Books. The purchase price was reported to be &quot;less than $5 million&quot;. That company formed Spin Media LLC as a holding company. The new owners appointed Andy Pemberton, a former editor at &quot;Blender&quot;, to succeed Michel as editor-in-chief. The first and only issue to be published under Pemberton&#x27;s editorship was the July 2006 issue which featured Beyoncé on the cover. Pemberton resigned from &quot;Spin&quot; in June 2006 and was succeeded by Doug Brod, who was executive editor during Michel&#x27;s tenure.

In 2008, the magazine began publishing a complete digital edition of each issue. For the 25th anniversary of Prince&#x27;s &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, in 2009, &quot;Spin&quot; released &quot;a comprehensive oral history of the film and album and a free downloadable tribute that features nine bands doing song-for-song covers of the record&quot;.

In March 2010, the entire collection of &quot;Spin&quot; magazine back issues became freely readable on Google Books. Brod remained editor until June 2011 when he was replaced by Steve Kandell who previously served as deputy editor. In July 2011, for the 20th anniversary of Nirvana&#x27;s 1991 album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, the magazine released a tribute album including all 13 songs with each covered by a different artist. The album released for free on Facebook included covers by Butch Walker, Amanda Palmer and Titus Andronicus.

With the March 2012 issue, &quot;Spin&quot; relaunched the magazine in a larger, bi-monthly format and, at the same time, expanded its online presence under digital general manager Jeff Rogers. In July 2012, &quot;Spin&quot; was sold to Buzzmedia, which eventually renamed itself SpinMedia, which was founded in 1999 by Anthony Batt and Marc Brown. The September/October 2012 issue was the magazine&#x27;s last print edition. It continued to publish entirely online with Caryn Ganz as its editor-in-chief. In June 2013, Ganz was succeeded by Jem Aswad, who was replaced by Craig Marks in June of the following year.

In 2016, Puja Patel was appointed editor and Eldridge Industries acquired SpinMedia via the Hollywood Reporter-Billboard Media Group for an undisclosed amount. Matt Medved became editor in December 2018.

&quot;Spin&quot; was acquired in 2020 by Next Management Partners. Jimmy Hutcheson serves as chief executive officer with Daniel Kohn as editorial director and &quot;Spin&quot;″s founder, Guccione Jr., who rejoined the magazine as creative advisor.

In late 2023, the publication received backlash for Guccione Jr.&#x27;s article defending former Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner after the latter made racist and sexist comments that got him ousted from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame board of directors as well as for &quot;Stand Together Music&quot;, an initiative used &quot;to launder the reputation of Koch Industries&quot;. In 2024 its week-long activation at the South by Southwest conference was sponsored by the United States Army, one of the factors that led to over 100 bands dropping off the festival in protest.

In May 2024, the magazine announced it would relaunch its print edition and publish quarterly starting in August.

== Books ==
In 1995, &quot;Spin&quot; produced its first book, entitled &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot;. It compiled writings by 64 music critics on recording artists and bands relevant to the alternative music movement, with each artist&#x27;s entry featuring their discography and albums reviewed and rated a score between one and ten. According to Pitchfork Media&#x27;s Matthew Perpetua, the book featured &quot;the best and brightest writers of the 80s and 90s, many of whom started off in zines but have since become major figures in music criticism,&quot; including Rob Sheffield, Byron Coley, Ann Powers, Simon Reynolds, and Alex Ross. Although the book was not a sales success, &quot;it inspired a disproportionate number of young readers to pursue music criticism.&quot; After the book was published, its entry on 1960s folk artist John Fahey, written by Byron Coley, helped renew interest in Fahey&#x27;s music, leading to interest from record labels and the alternative music scene.

For &quot;Spin&quot;″s 20th anniversary in 2005, it published a book, &quot;Spin: 20 Years of Alternative Music&quot;, chronicling the prior two decades in music. The book has essays on grunge, Britpop, and emo, among other genres of music, as well as pieces on musical acts including Marilyn Manson, Tupac Shakur, R.E.M., Nirvana, Weezer, Nine Inch Nails, Limp Bizkit, and the Smashing Pumpkins.

== Year-end lists ==
&quot;SPIN&quot; began compiling year-end lists in 1990.

=== Artist of the Year ===
===Single of the Year===
===Album of the Year===

Note: The 2000 album of the year was awarded to &quot;your hard drive&quot;, acknowledging the impact that filesharing had on the music listening experience in 2000. &quot;Kid A&quot; was listed as number 2, the highest ranking given to an actual album.

Additionally, the following albums were selected by the magazine as the best albums of their respective years in retrospective lists published decades later for years prior to the magazine&#x27;s 1990 introduction of year-end album lists:

<text>The Beretta 950 is a semi-automatic pistol designed and manufactured by Beretta since 1952. It builds on a long line of small and compact pocket pistols manufactured by Beretta for self-defense. It was intended to be a very simple and reliable pocket pistol.

==Specifications==
The Beretta 950 is a simple blowback pistol with a single action trigger mechanism and tip-up barrel. The frame is made out of aluminum alloy, the slide and barrel are carbon steel.

Early models (*950* and *950B* Pre-1968) do not have a safety lever, employing an inertial firing pin for safe hammer-down carry instead (the half cock notch is not for carry and could cause the gun to fire if dropped on the hammer). Later models (*950BS* Post-1968) are provided with an external safety lever. The &quot;950BS&quot; stands for &quot;Brevettato Sicurezza&quot;, meaning &quot;patented safety&quot; in Italian.

==Intended market==
The Beretta 950 Jetfire chambered in .25 ACP is a backup, self-defense pistol that is intended for undercover agents, police officers or individuals licensed to carry a concealed firearm for self-defense. The Minx version in .22 Short is not advised for such a role due to the caliber.

== Advantages ==
Being light weight, low profile and easily concealable makes it ideal for concealed carry. The tip-up barrel makes it easy to make safe and at the same time, easy to make ready to fire, and being chambered in .25 ACP means it is more reliable than similar pocket pistols chambered in .22 LR.

==Limitations==
The .25 ACP round allows it to be a very compact, lightweight gun, but the cartridge is relatively short ranged and low powered, putting it in the same class as the .22 LR rimfire cartridge. The accuracy of the pistol is adequate, but the small grip and short sight radius may limit some shooters to being effective only at short ranges, which, of course, is the range the gun was designed for.

Users being timid about recoil can make it prone to bite (the slide can cut the top of the shooter&#x27;s hand when fired) due to them holding the firearm too tightly. As the pistol lacks a shell extractor, relying instead on blowback pressure to clear the shells, misfires are removed manually by tipping up the barrel and pulling the shell out.

<doc id="613633" wikidata="Q223331" url="?curid=613633" title="Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)">
<text>Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3 in C minor, Op. 37 is always thought to have been composed in 1800, although the year of its composition has been questioned by some contemporary musicologists. It was first performed on 5 April 1803, with the composer as soloist. During that same performance, the Second Symphony and the oratorio &quot;Christ on the Mount of Olives&quot; were also premiered. The composition was published in 1804, and was dedicated to Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia. The first primary theme is reminiscent of that of Mozart&#x27;s 24th Piano Concerto, also in C minor.

==Structure==
The concerto is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 soprano clarinets in B, 2 bassoons, 2 French horns in F, 2 trumpets in B, timpani, strings and piano soloist.

As is standard for Classical/Romantic-era concertos, the work is in three movements:
===I. Allegro con brio===
This movement is known to make forceful use of the theme (direct and indirect) throughout.

Orchestral exposition: In the orchestral exposition, the theme is introduced by the strings, and used throughout the movement. It is developed several times. In the third section (second subject), the clarinet and violin 1 introduce the second main theme which is initially in the relative key, E major, and then in the tonic major, C major, finally back to C minor.

Second exposition: The piano enters with an ascending scale motif. The structure of the exposition in the piano solo is similar to that of the orchestral exposition.

Development: The piano enters, playing similar scales used in the beginning of the second exposition, this time in D major rather than C minor. The music is generally quiet.

Recapitulation: The orchestra restates the theme in fortissimo, with the wind instruments responding by building up a minor ninth chord as in the exposition. For the return of the second subject, Beethoven modulates to the tonic major, C major. A dark transition to the cadenza occurs, immediately switching from C major to C minor.

Cadenza: Beethoven wrote one cadenza for this movement. The cadenza Beethoven wrote is at times stormy and ends on a series of trills that calm down to pianissimo. Many other composers and pianists, such as Fazıl Say, Wilhelm Kempff, Clara Schumann, Franz Liszt, Bedřich Smetana, Ignaz Moscheles (in which his cadenza was misattributed to Johannes Brahms), and Charles Alkan have written alternative cadenzas.

Coda: Beethoven subverts the expectation of a return to the tonic at the end of the cadenza by prolonging the final trill and eventually arriving on a dominant seventh. The piano plays a series of arpeggios before the music settles into the home key of C minor. Then the music intensifies before a full tutti occurs, followed by the piano playing descending arpeggios, the ascending scale from the second exposition, and finally a resolute ending on C.

===II. Largo===

The second movement is in the key of E major, in this context a key relatively remote from the concerto&#x27;s opening key of C minor (another example being the much later Brahms&#x27;s first symphony). If the movement adhered to traditional form, its key would be E major (the relative key), A major (the submediant major or subdominant parallel) or C major (the tonic major or parallel key). The movement opens with the solo piano and the opening is marked with detailed pedaling instructions.

===III. Rondo – Allegro - Presto===
The finale is in sonata rondo form. The movement begins in C minor with an agitated theme played only by the piano. The movement ends with a C major coda marked presto.

==First performance==
The score was incomplete at its first performance. Beethoven&#x27;s friend Ignaz von Seyfried, who turned the pages of the music for him that night, later wrote:

I saw almost nothing but empty pages; at the most, on one page or another a few Egyptian hieroglyphs wholly unintelligible to me were scribbled down to serve as clues for him; for he played nearly all the solo part from memory since, as was so often the case, he had not had time to set it all down on paper.
