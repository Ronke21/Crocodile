<text>Corwen is a town and community in the county of Denbighshire in Wales. Historically, Corwen was part of the county of Merionethshire. Corwen stands on the banks of the River Dee beneath the Berwyn mountains. The town is situated west of Llangollen and south of Ruthin. At the 2011 Census, Corwen (community and ward) had a population of 2,325, decreasing slightly from the 2001 population of 2,398, The community, with an area of , includes Corwen and the surrounding villages of Carrog, Clawdd Poncen and Glyndyfrdwy. The Office for National Statistics identifies Corwen Built-up area with a 2011 population of 477 and an area of .

==History==

Corwen is best known for its connections with Owain Glyndŵr, who was proclaimed Prince of Wales on 16 September 1400, from his nearby manor of Glyndyfrdwy, which began his fourteen-year rebellion against English rule.

A statue of Glyndŵr by the sculptor Simon van de Put was installed in The Square in Corwen in 1995, and in 2007 it was replaced with a larger equestrian statue by Colin Spofforth. It commemorates the day he was proclaimed the last true Prince of Wales in 1400.

The town grew as a centre for cattle drovers. Attractions in Corwen include the motte of a Norman castle, the thirteenth-century Church of St Mael and St Sulien and the Capel Rûg built in 1637 by William Salesbury.

Corwen Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1909. The club closed at the onset of World War II.

==Economy==
Located in the hills of north Wales, the main economy of Corwen is based in and around farming. The town&#x27;s main employer is local trailer manufacturer Ifor Williams Trailers, started by a farmer looking to transport sheep to the local market.

==Transport==
In the 1860s Corwen was linked to the national rail network in 1864 by a line from Ruthin along the Vale of Clwyd and in 1865 with a Great Western Railway branch line along the Dee valley from Ruabon. The station was a vital development in the town&#x27;s importance as the centre of the local agriculture industry. Unfortunately neither survived the Beeching Axe in the 1960s. The town is now linked to the Llangollen Railway. A temporary station, Corwen East (Welsh: &quot;Dwyrain Corwen&quot;), was opened in 2014, with a new permanent Corwen station opened in June 2023, alongside the town&#x27;s main car-park near the town centre.

Bus services in Corwen were primarily provided by GHA Coaches with routes available to Wrexham via Llangollen on services 5 and T3, Barmouth via Bala and Dolgellau on service T3 (now operated by Lloyds Coaches), and to Ruthin on service X5 (now operated by Arriva Buses Wales), with through services continuing to Denbigh. Llew Jones operate a twice daily, weekday service to Llanrwst with one journey extended to/from Bala.

Corwen is the last sizeable settlement on the A5 road from London to Holyhead until Betws-y-Coed is reached. Because of this it still contains a number of hotels which were used in the past as coaching inns for the Mail coach and stagecoaches. Although the A5 is no longer the most important road to Holyhead, having been superseded by the coastal route of the A55, there is still significant traffic travelling through the town centre&#x27;s narrow main street.

==Governance==
At the local level, Corwen is governed by Corwen Town Council, with 13 town councillors elected or co-opted from the Lower ward and Upper ward of the town.

Corwen had its own electoral ward to Denbighshire County Council, until the 2022 local elections. The ward elected one county councillor. Plaid Cymru councillor, Huw &quot;Chick&quot; Jones, died in office in 2020, leading to a by-election in March 2021 which was won by Plaid Cymru&#x27;s Alan Hughes.

In 2022 the ward was merged with the neighbouring Llandrillo ward, to be named Edeirnion, electing two councillors. Hughes was one of the successful candidates at the 2022 Denbighshire County Council election.

==Culture==
Corwen hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1919. The Pavilion in the town, which was pulled down in 2015, played an important part in Welsh culture throughout the 20th century. It hosted several concerts and eisteddfodau. It was also the venue for the first concerts performed by Edward H. Dafis, the first Welsh-language rock band to receive significant press notice, in August 1973.

In 1938, Elena Puw Morgan, then living in Annedd Wen, Corwen, became the first woman to win the Literary Medal for her novel Y Graith (The Scar) at the National Eisteddfod in Cardiff.

Novelist John Cowper Powys (1872-1963) lived in Corwen with his common-law wife Phyllis Playter from 1935 until 1955, when they moved to Blaenau Ffestiniog. He wrote two major novels both set in this region of Wales, while living in Corwen, &quot;Owen Glendower&quot; (1940) and &quot;Porius&quot; (1951), amongst other works of both fiction and non-fiction. In 1940 he began a novel set in contemporary Corwen but gave it up, to start his &quot;Romance of Corwen&quot;, &quot;&quot;, in January 1942, the action of which takes place in 499 AD.

<text>Bobst Boy is the nickname of Steven Stanzak (born January 25, 1984), a New York University student who spent eight months living in the basement of one of the school&#x27;s libraries, Bobst Library from September 2003 to April 2004.

Before living in the Bobst library, Stanzak was an ordinary student living on loans and part-time jobs, without financial assistance from his parents. In September 2003, he found that his NYU scholarship, four jobs, and private loans would cover his tuition costs, but he could not get enough loans to cover housing. He refused to drop out or transfer to a cheaper university, choosing instead to live in the library. Stanzak quickly grew tired of answering peoples&#x27; questions about life in the library, and posted a Q&amp;A online, which eventually grew into the blog and web site, and Stanzak developed an underground fan following on NYU&#x27;s campus.

The &quot;Washington Square News&quot;, one of NYU&#x27;s student papers, was told of Stanzak&#x27;s situation and asked to do a profile on him. At first Stanzak refused, fearing how NYU would react to the situation. However, once Stanzak was told that the article would only be printed with his consent, he agreed to an interview. In April 2004, just before the release of the news article, an NYU dean was told of Stanzak&#x27;s situation, and requested a meeting. At the meeting, the dean told Stanzak that his initiative was remarkable, but that he could no longer live in the library, and Stanzak was provided free NYU housing for the last few weeks of classes.
The day the profile was published, reporters started calling Stanzak, and he became an overnight celebrity. Stanzak received widespread media attention, appearing on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on April 29.

Stanzak continued to receive financial assistance from NYU until graduation, and no longer updates his blog or web site. After his time in Bobst library, he became a Resident Assistant at NYU&#x27;s Lafayette Street Residence, in Chinatown.

After graduation from NYU, Stanzak later attended Indiana University Bloomington, where he received an M.A. (2009) and Ph.D. (2014), both in folklore. He subsequently became a software engineer; among other projects he developed a web application for New Yorkers to apply for rental assistance.

<doc id="621856" wikidata="Q771706" url="?curid=621856" title="Gold barb">
<text>:&quot;This species may be confused with:&quot; golden barb&quot; (&quot;P. gelius&quot;).&quot;

Barbodes semifasciolatus, the Chinese barb, is a species of cyprinid fish native to the Red River basin in southeast Asia where they occur in fresh waters at depths of or less. The captive variant popularly known as the gold barb or Schuberti barb is an extremely popular aquarium fish.

==Description==
Adults of this species have highly arched backs and a short pair of barbels on the upper jaw at the corners of the mouth. The back is light to reddish brown, the sides are metallic green or yellow-green, with a brassy or golden sheen below. The belly is whitish, and yellow-green in males at mating time. Females can be distinguished by their dull colors and their overall bulk.

This species can reach a length of TL though most do not exceed SL.

==Diet==
Their diet consists of invertebrates (such as insects, crustaceans and worms) and plant matter.

== Breeding ==
An egg-scatter, adult barbs will usually spawn around a hundred eggs, although up to 400 eggs have been observed from an exceptional female. This breeding occurs at the first light in the early morning.

==In the aquarium==
The popular gold strain &quot;P. semifasciolatus&quot; var. &quot;Schuberti&quot; (gold barb or Schuberti barb) was developed by hobbyist Thomas Schubert of Camden, New Jersey in the 1960s through selective breeding. For many years it was thought to be a distinct species but is in fact a selected sort of the indigenous (green) species which is rarely found in aquaria. The gold barb is an active, mildly aggressive schooling species that spends most of its time in the mid-level and bottom of the water. Its typical lifespan in captivity is around four to six years. This gold fish is often used in community tanks by fish keeping hobbyists. It breeds readily in outdoor pools and free-standing ponds during summer months, and withstands cooler temperatures better than other tropical fish. However, it does not stand the cold as well as its original plainer China barb counterparts.

Albino variants of the gold barbs have been produced by Dennis Wilcox in the 1970s in the US. Gold barbs with no black markings have been observed by Stanislav Frank in Europe also around that time. Flesh colour (pink) specimens appeared by the 1990s. Tri-colour, i.e., black, yellow, and pink specimens appeared recently.
In an aquarium, the gold barb eats flake food readily, but benefits from the occasional feeding of live food such as mosquito larvae or daphnia.

<doc id="621866" wikidata="Q844624" url="?curid=621866" title="Rosy barb">
<text>The rosy barb (Pethia conchonius) is a subtropical freshwater cyprinid fish found in southern Asia from Afghanistan to Bangladesh.

==Description==

This species of barb grows up to in length. Juveniles possess large, deeply forked tails, which are large in proportion to their body. Their colour becomes bolder during their mating periods. Males have more vibrant colours and females areslightly plumper. Also note that females do not have any black colour in their fins while males do. They may weigh up to 340g (12 ounces) when fully grown but can weigh much less during adolescence. They are mature at .

==Habitat==
In the wild their omnivorous diet consists of worms, insects, crustaceans, and plant matter. They have a lifespan of up to 5 years. Rosy barbs natively live in lakes and fast flowing water in a subtropical climate. Their natural habitat has a pH of 6 to 8, a water hardness of 5-19 dGH, and a temperature range of .

==Importance to humans==
The fish has commercial importance in the aquarium trade and is one of several species of barbs used to create hybrid versions of &quot;tiger barbs&quot;.

==Breeding==
When the female is ready to spawn, she will appear swollen with eggs. The males will circle and chase the females, repeatedly nudging her head and belly area. Spawning usually occurs in the early morning, and lasts several hours resulting in several hundred eggs. Eggs are usually deposited in groups of plants, and the pair will attempt to eat any that they are able to locate.

The young hatch in 24 to 36 hours, depending on water temperature. A day later, the young fish will hang on the plants, and/or the sides of the tank if the breeding takes place in an aquarium. In about six days the young are free-swimming and will seek out food. In captivity, they can be fed newly hatched brine shrimp.

Rosy barb has been successfully hybridized with the tiger barb (&quot;Puntius tetrazona&quot;), i.e. crossing female tiger barb with male rosy barb. The hybrids reached maturity and were all males, however they were sterile.

==In the aquarium==
The rosy barb is an active, peaceful species well-suited for a community aquarium. It is considered one of the hardiest barbs, undemanding and beautiful, and most impressively colored during the mating period. It can be kept together with other small fish but can be aggressive toward other fish and nip their fins. They will eat most foods provided to them. They are best kept in groups of 5 or more in an aquarium with a length of at least . They usually reach a maximum size of . Using a dark-colored gravel will show off the color of the fish.

<text>David Healy [[FRCPsych]], a professor of psychiatry at Bangor University in the United Kingdom, is a psychiatrist, psychopharmacologist, scientist and author. His main areas of research are the contribution of antidepressants to suicide, conflict of interest between pharmaceutical companies and academic medicine, and the history of pharmacology. Healy has written more than 150 peer-reviewed articles, 200 other articles, and 20 books, including &quot;The Antidepressant Era&quot;, &quot;The Creation of Psychopharmacology&quot;, &quot;The Psychopharmacologists Volumes 1–3&quot;, &quot;Let Them Eat Prozac&quot; and &quot;Mania: A Short History of Bipolar Disorder&quot;.

Healy has been involved as an expert witness in homicide and suicide trials involving psychotropic drugs, and has brought concerns about some medications to the attention of drug regulators. He has also said that pharmaceutical companies sell drugs by marketing diseases and co-opting academic opinion-leaders. In his 2012 book &quot;Pharmageddon&quot; he argues that pharmaceutical companies have dominated healthcare in America, often with life-threatening results for patients.

== Career ==
David Healy originally trained in Dublin, Ireland, and at Cambridge University. He is a former Secretary of the British Association for Psychopharmacology. He is currently a professor of psychiatry at Bangor University in the United Kingdom, a psychiatrist, psychopharmacologist, scientist, and author. His main areas of research are the development and history of psychopharmacology, and the impact of psychotropic drugs on our culture. Healy has written more than 150 peer-reviewed articles, 200 other articles, and 20 books, including &quot;The Antidepressant Era&quot; and &quot;The Creation of Psychopharmacology&quot; from Harvard University Press, &quot;The Psychopharmacologists Volumes 1–3&quot; and &quot;Let Them Eat Prozac&quot; from New York University Press, and &quot;Mania: A Short History of Bipolar Disorder&quot; from Johns Hopkins University Press.

Healy has been involved as a legal expert witness in homicide and suicide trials involving psychotropic drugs, and has brought concerns about some drugs to the attention of American and British regulators. He has alleged that pharmaceutical companies sell drugs by marketing diseases and co-opting academic opinion-leaders, sometimes ghostwriting their articles. His most recent book, &quot;Pharmageddon&quot;, claims that pharmaceutical companies have dominated healthcare in America, often with life-threatening results for patients. In 2000 a lucrative job at Toronto&#x27;s Centre for Addiction and Mental Health was withdrawn under unclear circumstances. Healy and his supporters have claimed that this withdrawal was due to Healy giving a speech and publishing a paper claiming that the SSRI antidepressant fluoxetine increases the risk that patients will commit suicide. Lilly was a major contributor to the Centre at the time. A settlement was reached, in which Healy received a visiting professor appointment, and a joint statement was released stating &quot;Although Dr Healy believes that his clinical appointment was rescinded because of his November 2000 speech at the CAMH [Centre for Addiction and Mental Health], Dr Healy accepts assurances that pharmaceutical companies played no role in either CAMH&#x27;s decision to rescind his clinical appointment or the University of Toronto&#x27;s decision to rescind his academic appointment.&quot;

Healy directs an Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) clinic in Wales. He strongly defends the procedure as having an immediate visible effect in severely depressed patients for whom no other options have worked, particularly geriatric patients. He has co-written a history of ECT along with Edward Shorter and cites Max Fink as a source. Healy has clarified which chapters he wrote and that he was not personally financially supported by Fink&#x27;s Scion Foundation. Another reforming psychiatrist, Peter Breggin, has strongly criticised Healy for this aspect of his work on the grounds of ethics and the longer-term data. Healy has even speculated that Insulin coma therapy may have &#x27;worked&#x27; in the sense of generating enthusiasm in staff and in an unclear way to challenge anxiety or &#x27;psychosis&#x27;, despite a lack of, or contrary, evidence from the time. He has also been criticized for portraying psychiatrists as greedy and duped.

Healy is a founder and chief executive officer of Data Based Medicine Limited, which operates through its website RxISK.org, which aims to make medicines safer through &quot;online direct patient reporting of drug effects&quot;. Healy sits on the Honorary International Editorial Advisory Board of the Mens Sana Monographs.

In 2020 Healy&#x27;s book &quot;The Decapitation of Healthcare - A Short History of the Rise and Fall of Healthcare&quot; was published by Samizdat Health Writers&#x27; Co-operative, the first of a series.Ref Rxisk blog and David Healy Blog Feb 2020

== Research interests ==

=== SSRI antidepressants and suicide ===
In an international review article, Healy (and Aldred) say that the idea that antidepressants might contribute to suicide in depressed patients was first raised in 1958. For 30 years antidepressants were primarily used in severely depressed and often hospitalised patients. The issue of suicidality on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) became one of public concern with reports in 1990 that Prozac could lead to suicidality in patients. Fourteen years later, warning labels were put on antidepressants suggesting particular difficulties &quot;during the early phase of treatment, during treatment discontinuation, and when the dose of treatment is being changed, and that treatment related risks may be present in patients being treated for syndromes other than depression, such as anxiety or smoking cessation&quot;.

Healy has written many papers and presented many lectures on his view that all SSRI antidepressants – Prozac, Paxil and Zoloft – should show warning labels, as they could &quot;trigger suicidal and violent behavior in some patients&quot;.

=== Conflict of interest ===
Healy says that the pharmaceutical industry has a pervasive influence on academic medicine. Most of the authors published in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; have received research funding from, or acted as a consultant for, a drug company. Major journals have expressed concern at the ghostwriting of and conflicting interests surrounding pharmacotherapeutic studies, especially in psychiatry.

Medical ghostwriting occurs when anonymous scribes with scientific backgrounds are paid to produce reports for publication as if written by better-known experts. Healy estimates that 50 per cent of literature on drugs is ghostwritten/abnormally written. This is an estimate by Healy offered under questioning before the UK House of Commons Health Select Committee investigation. It is based on extrapolation of a 57% figure from a published paper by Healy and Cattell reliant on hard evidence on a set of papers on Zoloft which came to light due to legal discovery, to the wider field of drug studies in top quality journals. In his thesis, Healy states that ghostwriters write on research given to them by drug companies, which want both positive results and positive research; therefore ghostwriting is biased from the beginning.

Healy allegedly encountered ghost writing involving Wyeth&#x27;s SNRI Effexor. Healy attended a meeting promoting Effexor, and was offered for his approval a draft article that had been written for him. He left it intact, but made two additions. One contradicted Wyeth&#x27;s claim that Effexor got patients fully well compared to patients on other SSRIs and another stated that SSRIs could make some individuals suicidal. The article had already been submitted to the &quot;Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience&quot; before Healy saw it again; both of his additions had been removed. In response Healy removed his name from the article.

In the preface of his book &quot;Let them Eat Prozac&quot; Healy describes the need for a &quot;new contract between society and the pharmaceutical industry – a contract that will require access to the raw data&quot;. Healy suggests a new division that can manage the hazards that only becomes visible after products are launched. This new division would be separate from the regulatory bodies and pharmaceutical companies. In &quot;Interface between authorship, industry and science in the domain of therapeutics&quot; a paper of 2003 for The British Journal of Psychiatry, David Healy notes that

::&quot;The literature profiles and citation rates of industry-linked and non-industry-linked articles differ. The emerging style of authorship in industry-linked articles can deliver good-quality articles, but it raises concerns for the scientific base of therapeutics … If ghostwriting is an inevitable feature of modern scientific writing, the potential availability of the raw data would do more to ensure a correspondence between those data and a published end result than could be achieved by any other mechanism&quot;.

=== History of pharmacology ===

In his book 2012 &quot;Pharmageddon&quot;, Healy discusses the well-publicised birth defects crisis caused by thalidomide, a drug initially marketed as a sleeping pill. The 1962 disaster involved more than 10,000 children in 46 countries being born limbless and disabled. The United States Congress wanted to prevent a recurrence of such a tragedy, and sought to limit the marketing excesses of the pharmaceutical industry. So new drug development was rewarded with product rather than process patents, and new drugs were made available only through prescription. Also, new medications had to prove they worked through controlled trials before they reached the market. On the 50th anniversary of the 1962 FDA bill enacted by Congress, &quot;Pharmageddon&quot; argues that these arrangements have not been successful and have actually led to an escalating number of drug induced deaths and injuries. In the same book (&quot;Pharmageddon&quot; page 155), Healy states that in the United States, the country that makes the greatest use of the latest pharmaceuticals, life expectancy has been falling progressively further behind other developed countries since the mid-1970s.

<doc id="621873" wikidata="Q669171" url="?curid=621873" title="Newtown, Powys">
<text>Newtown () is a town in Powys, Wales. It lies on the River Severn in the community of Newtown and Llanllwchaiarn, within the historic boundaries of Montgomeryshire. It was designated a new town in 1967 and saw population growth as firms settled, changing its market town character. Its 2001 population of 10,780 rose to 11,357 in the 2011 census, and rose again to 11,362 in the 2021 census.

Newtown was the birthplace of Robert Owen in 1771, whose house stood on the present site of the HSBC Bank. The town has a theatre, Theatr Hafren, and a public gallery, Oriel Davies, displaying contemporary arts and crafts. It is the largest town in Powys and Mid Wales.

==Etymology==
The ancient parish and commote are named Cedewain, and Newtown was home to a Llan dedicated to St Mary. As such, the first recorded name for the town was Llanfair-yng-Nghedewain.

Both the modern English name &quot;Newtown&quot; and its Latin variant &quot;Nova Villa&quot; first appear in the thirteenth century following the Norman invasion of Wales. Robert Owen stated that the name was adopted to distinguish the town from the older centre of Norman power in Powys, at Caersws.

The ancient Welsh name continued in use until the modern era. noted that the modern Welsh name appears with the definite article as Y Drênewydd. Owen stated that this was influenced by Newtown&#x27;s status as one of only two &quot;New towns&quot; in Wales proposed by John Silkin in 1949.

==History==
===Foundation===
During the early medieval period a hamlet named Llanfair-yng-Nghedewain lay within the area that is now Newtown. Its original Welsh name is derived from being situated near a River Severn ford below the Long Bridge and close to the church of St Mary in Bettws Cedewain.

The area came to the attention of the English Crown in the 13th century when Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales, created a new administrative centre (Welsh: &quot;cantref&quot;) at Dolforwyn Castle near Abermule following the Treaty of Montgomery between himself and Henry III. Llywelyn had the castle built to consolidate the land he had been given according to the treaty. However, it was not long after the death of Henry III in 1272 that tension arose with the English at their outpost of Montgomery Castle in the Welsh Marches. This led Edward I to seize and capture Dolforwyn Castle in 1277. He then granted Llywelyn&#x27;s lands to the powerful Marcher Lord, Roger Mortimer, who transferred the administration of the &quot;cantref&quot; of Cedewain and the &quot;commote&quot; of Ceri from Dolforwyn Castle to a new settlement he planned to build further down the valley at Newtown. The town&#x27;s market charter was granted in 1279.

With the subjugation of the Welsh completed by 1282, Newtown was developed as an English plantation town as part of Edward I&#x27;s policy known as the Ring of Iron.

===Industrialisation===

The town grew in the 18th and 19th centuries around the textile and flannel industry, stimulated by completion of the Montgomeryshire Canal. In 1838, the town saw Wales&#x27;s first Chartist demonstration.

The Cambrian Mills, opened in 1856, were the first steam-driven mills in Newtown. The mills stood beside the canal terminus on the east bank of the Severn. They expanded to become the largest of the Welsh woollen mills. However, by the end of the 19th century the Newtown mills were no longer competitive with those in the north of England. There was a disastrous fire in 1910 and another in 1912, after which the Cambrian Mills were not rebuilt. Thereafter Newtown was no longer an important centre of the woollen industry and many workers moved elsewhere.
Newtown hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1965. In 1967, the town was designated a new town. It saw a large population growth as firms and people settled, changing its rural market town character.

The population of Newtown in 2001 was 10,780, and increased to 11,347 in 2011. The census of 2021 recorded 11,362 people.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Newtown, at community (town) and county level: Newtown and Llanllwchaiarn Town Council (often abbreviated to Newtown Town Council) and Powys County Council.

The two parishes of Newtown and Llanllwchaiarn were governed by a single local board from 1866. Such local boards became urban district councils under the Local Government Act 1894, and the Newtown and Llanllwchaiarn Urban District Council went on to govern the town from 1894 until 1974. In 1974 all urban districts were abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, with most of Newtown and Llanllwchaiarn Urban District Council&#x27;s functions passing to Montgomeryshire District Council. At the same time a community was established covering the area of the former urban district, with its council taking the name Newtown and Llanllwchaiarn Town Council. Further local government reorganisation took place across Wales in 1996, when Montgomeryshire District Council was abolished and its functions passed to Powys County Council.

The Town Council has 16 elected members serving five-year terms, and employs a staff of about ten. It deals mainly with green spaces and public facilities, and as a representative voice for Newtown. The Council Chair or Mayor, elected by the councillors, has been Councillor John Byrne since May 2022.

The community is represented on Powys County Council by five county councillors, each representing a ward: Newtown Central, Newtown East, Newtown Llanllwchaiarn West, Newtown Llanllwchaiarn West and Newtown South.

==Geography==

Newtown lies about 8 miles (13 km) from the Wales-England border, in the narrow valley of the River Severn, which restricts development north and south of the town. It is surrounded by small villages, often referred to collectively as the Newtown area. The Newtown post town area, including the villages, has a population approaching 16,000. The villages include Aberhafesp, Adfa, Bettws Cedewain, Bwlch-y-ffridd, Cefn-gwyn, Dolfor, Glanmule, Kerry, Llanllwchaiarn, Llanwyddelan, Mochdre, New Mills, Pentre, Rhydlydan, Sarn and Tregynon.

==Buildings and monuments==

Built by Pryce Pryce-Jones, the Pryce Jones Royal Welsh Warehouse remains the tallest building in Newtown. The two towering structures housed the world&#x27;s first mail order service depot.

Bear Lanes, the town&#x27;s main shopping centre, has a Tudor-style entrance. The building was once a hotel, &quot;The Bear&quot;, which contributes to the centre&#x27;s appearance today.

The Robert Owen Museum is on the ground floor of the council offices in Brisco House, Broad Street. A statue of Robert Owen was erected in 1956 in a park off Shortbridge Street and Gas Street. A replica of this was later erected in Manchester.

The Free Library building designed by the architect Frank Shayler of Shrewsbury was built in 1902. The Baptist Chapel, dating from 1881, is a fine example of nonconformist architecture from that period. The Back Lane drill hall was completed in 1897.

==Transport==
Newtown&#x27;s station is on the Cambrian Line served by Transport for Wales. Trains run about once in two hours.

Local bus services in and around the town are operated by local, privately owned companies: Tanat Valley Coaches, Minsterley Motors, and Owen&#x27;s Travelmaster. Newtown has one National Express bus per day in each direction, to Aberystwyth and to London. Newtown has one TrawsCymru route to Cardiff and a TrawsCymru Connect to Machynlleth and to Wrexham. Two major roads meet at Newtown: the A483 from Swansea to Chester and the A489 from Machynlleth to Craven Arms. The bypass to the south of Newtown opened on 14 February 2019, having been planned since 1949.

The Montgomery Canal terminated in Newtown. After its closure in 1944, the Newtown section was sold for building land, but it gave its name to Canal Road and Lower Canal Road.

<text>Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant () is a village and community in Powys, Wales; about 9 miles west of Oswestry and 12 miles south of Llangollen, on the B4580. It lies near the foothills of the Berwyn mountains on the river Rhaeadr. At the top end of the valley is the Pistyll Rhaeadr waterfall, one of the Seven Wonders of Wales in the old rhyme. One mile north of the town is the hill Moel Hen-fache (515 m). The community includes the hamlet of Llanarmon Mynydd Mawr.

It was an important site in the ancient commote (or cantref; sources disagree) of Mochnant, as indicated by the &quot;ym-Mochnant&quot; in its name (translates to &quot;in Mochnant&quot;).

Until 1974, Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant was split into two civil parishes: the northern parish was in historic Denbighshire and the southern parish in historic Montgomeryshire; this reflected the division of the ancient commote in the 12th century. The divide continued between 1974 and 1996, with the former Denbighshire parish being placed in Clwyd and the former Montgomeryshire parish in Powys, each with their own community councils. In 1996, both parts of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant were united within the county of Powys, and the community councils were amalgamated in 2008. The former boundary appears to have been the Afon Rhaeadr, which passes through the village and present-day community.

==Buildings and antiquities==
Capel Seion is in the village. It is a Methodist chapel rebuilt in the early 20th century in Arts and Crafts style.

==Population==
In the 2001 Census the population was 1,470, of whom 55% were Welsh-speaking. In the 2011 census the population had fallen to 1,195, with 408 in the village itself.

The village falls in the electoral ward of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant/Llansilin. The ward population at the 2011 Census was 2,295.

==Parish church==

The Norman church of St Dogfan is a Grade II* listed building, restored between 1879 and 1882, but with parts dating back to the 13th century. There is a gravestone with a Celtic cross possibly commemorating Cwgan son of Ethelstan, a Welsh prince of the 11th century.

The parish is best known for its former vicar, William Morgan (1545–10 September 1604), who first translated the whole Bible into Welsh in the 1580s and later became a bishop of Llandaff and of St. Asaph. Gwallter Mechain (1761–1849), the bard, was the vicar from 1837 until his death in 1849. Rev. Griffith Hartwell Jones (1859–1944), a Welsh academic and Anglican clergyman was born in the village.

St Dogfan was a son of Brychan Brycheiniog and a Welsh prince in the 5th century. A clas dedicated to him was founded on the site of the present church. The holy well of the saint is on the farm of Gwernfeifod in Cwm-ffynnon.

==Local attractions==
Attractions near the village include the Pistyll Rhaeadr waterfall, known for its natural arch, the Berwyn Mountains, and Lake Vyrnwy.

==Public transport==
Bus services are operated by Tanat Valley Coaches, based in the village. Route 76 links the village with Llanfyllin, Meifod and Welshpool. Routes 79/79A connect the town with Llangynog, Llangedwyn, Penybontfawr and Oswestry.

The village was at one point served by the defunct Tanat Valley Light Railway which served Pentrefelin, Llanrhaiadr Mochnant and Pedairffordd Halt. Of these station, Llanrhaiadr Mochant was the closest one to the village being around a mile south east. These closed in 1951 to passengers along with the line to Llangynog but the line remained open to freight to as far as Llanrhaeadr Mochant until 1964 when the entire line to Blodwell Junction was closed.

The trackbed has been incorporated into agricultural use but the newly formed Tanat Valley Light Railway has expressed interest in reopening the line to as far as Llanrhaiadr Mochnant for heritage and tourist use; it is currently focused on reaching Blodwell Junction from Nantmawr.

==Film location==
Parts of the 1995 film &quot;The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain&quot;, starring Hugh Grant, were filmed in the village, portraying the real-life village of Taff&#x27;s Well, in Rhondda Cynon Taf, which by 1995 had become too developed to use.

More recently, the village featured in the 2012 film &quot;Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger&quot; with David Tennant, as the village where the St. Bernadette&#x27;s school bus stopped to buy sweets on the way to Lake Vyrnwy in search of the (fictitious) &quot;Castell Llawen&quot; (&#x27;Merry Castle&#x27;).

<doc id="621881" wikidata="Q729207" url="?curid=621881" title="Tiger barb">
<text>The tiger barb or Sumatra barb (Puntigrus tetrazona), is a species of tropical cyprinid fish. The natural geographic range reportedly extends throughout the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo in Indonesia, with unsubstantiated sightings reported in Cambodia.
Tiger barbs are also found in many other parts of Asia, and with little reliable collection data over long periods of time, definite conclusions about their natural geographic range versus established introductions are difficult. Tiger barbs may sometimes be confused with &quot;Puntigrus anchisporus&quot;, &quot;Puntigrus navjotsodhii,&quot; or &quot;Puntigrus partipentazona,&quot; which are similar in appearance, the only differences being the slightly different stripe pattern and the number of scales these fish have.

==Description==
The tiger barb can grow to about long and wide, although they are often smaller when kept in captivity. Some can grow to around 13 centimeters as well. Native fish are silver to brownish yellow with four vertical black stripes and red fins and snout. The green tiger barb is the same size and has the same nature as the normal barb, but has a green body. The green tiger barb, often called the moss green tiger barb, can vary considerably in how green it looks; to some people, it looks nearly black. Albino barbs are a light yellow with four barely visible stripes.

==Habitat==
Tiger barbs have been reported to be found in clear or turbid shallow waters of moderately flowing streams. They live in Indonesia, Borneo, tropical climates and prefer water with a 6.0–7.5 pH, a water hardness of 5–19 dGH, and a temperature range of 77 – 82 °F or 25 – 27.8 °C. Their discovery in swamp lakes subject to great changes in water level suggests a wide tolerance to water quality fluctuations. Their average lifespan is 7 years. When exposed to decreased temperature levels, the Tiger barb fish experiences a change in body color. The male fish tend to display a bright red color in the dorsal fin, ventral fin, caudal fin, and snout. When the water temperature drops to 21 °C, both the male and the female fish were observed to have a decayed body color. When the temperature decreases even further to 19 °C, their distinct stripes even appear to be dimmed.

==Commercial importance==

The tiger barb is one of over 70 species of barb with commercial importance in the aquarium trade. Of the total ornamental fish species imported into the United States in 1992, only 20 species account for more than 60% of the total number of specimens reported, with tiger barbs falling at tenth on the list, with 2.6 million individuals imported. (Chapman et al. 1994). Barbs that have been selectively bred to emphasize bright color combinations have grown in popularity and production over the last 20 years. Examples of colour morphs (not hybrids) of tiger barb include highly melanistic green tiger barbs that reflect green over their black because of the Tyndall effect, gold tiger barbs and albino tiger barbs.
==In the aquarium==

The tiger barb, an active shoaling fish, is usually kept in groups of six or more. They are often aggressive in numbers less than five, and are known fin nippers. Semi aggressive fish form a pecking order in the pack which they may extend to other fish, giving them a reputation for nipping at the fins of other fish, especially if they are wounded or injured. They are thus not recommended for tanks with slower, more peaceful fishes such as bettas, gouramis, angelfish and others with long, flowing fins. They do, however, work well with many fast-moving fish such as danios, platys and most catfish. When in large enough groups, however, they tend to spend most of their time chasing each other and leave other species of fish alone. They dwell primarily at the water&#x27;s mid-level. One of the best tankmates for the tiger barb provided there is considerable space is the clown loach, which will school with the tiger barbs and act as they do, and the tigers act as the loaches do.
Tiger barbs do best in soft, slightly acidic water. The tank should be well lit with ample vegetation, about two-thirds of the tank space. These barbs are omnivorous, and will consume processed foods such as flakes and crisps, as well as live foods. They are relatively greedy with their food consumption and can become aggressive during feeding time. Tiger barbs seem more susceptible than other species to cottonmouth (columnaris), a bacterial infection.

==Breeding==

The tiger barb usually attains sexual maturity at a body length of in total length, or at approximately six to seven weeks of age. The females are larger with a rounder belly and a mainly black dorsal fin, while the males have a bright, red nose with a distinct red line above the black on their dorsal fins. The egg-layers tend to spawn several hundred eggs in the early morning in clumps of plants. On average, 300 eggs can be expected from each spawn in a mature broodstock population, although the number of eggs released will increase with the maturity and size of the fish. Spawned eggs are adhesive, negatively buoyant in freshwater and average 1.18 ± 0.05 mm in diameter.

Tiger barbs have been documented to spawn as many as 500 eggs per female (Scheurmann 1990; Axelrod 1992). Females can spawn at approximately two week intervals (Munro et al. 1990).

Once spawning is finished, they will usually eat any of the eggs they can find.

==Common varieties==

Interspecific and intraspecific hybridization is done to achieve different colors and patterns to satisfy market demand for new tiger barb varieties. Gold and albino tiger barbs are examples of commercially produced fish based on recessive xanthic (yellow) and albino genes. These are not hybrids.
GloFish, the brand of genetically-modified fluorescent fish, sell tiger barbs in various fluorescent colors.

<text>David Crawford Lochary (August 21, 1944 – July 29, 1977) was an American actor, one of the regular &quot;Dreamlander&quot; actors in early films of the controversial &quot;trash&quot; film director John Waters. He starred in such films as &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;, &quot;Female Trouble&quot;, and &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot;, in which he typically played exotically dressed, sophisticated perverts. Lochary co-wrote &quot;The Diane Linkletter Story&quot; with Divine, and worked as an uncredited hair and makeup artist on many of Waters&#x27; films. Lochary met Divine at beauty school and used to style his wigs and makeup for parties. Divine later commented that he had &quot;never even heard the word &#x27;drag&#x27; before David.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Lochary was the son of Dean and Mary Eileen (née McMahan) Lochary; his mother Mary was featured in two of Waters&#x27; films: &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot; and &quot;Female Trouble&quot;. Donald Lochary, David&#x27;s elder brother, died in July 2019; he also played a small, uncredited role in &quot;Female Trouble&quot;.

Lochary was gay; in the &#x27;70s, he dated singer John Condon.

According to Robert Maier, Lochary moved from Baltimore to New York in the &#x27;70s in order to become more famous. After failing to become commercially successful, he then started to struggle with addiction; by the time of his death, he was &quot;far gone on substances&quot;.

Lochary has developed a cult following throughout the years, including fan-clubs.

In 1977, Lochary died while intoxicated on PCP.

<doc id="621886" wikidata="Q3809153" url="?curid=621886" title="Michmas">
<text>Michmas (; ) was an Israelite and Jewish town located in the highlands north of Jerusalem. According to the Hebrew Bible, it belonged to the Tribe of Benjamin. It was the setting of the biblical Battle of Michmash, recounted in 1 Samuel 14. Michmas was inhabited during the Second Temple period, when, according to the Mishnah, its fine wheat was brought to the Temple.

Michmas is identified with the Palestinian village of Mukhmas in the West Bank, which preserves its ancient name. The nearby Israeli settlement Ma&#x27;ale Mikhmas, founded in 1981, is also named after the biblical town.

==Location==
Michmas was located near Geba, east of Bethel and south of Migron, and on the road to Jerusalem. Michmas lay on the line of march of an invading army from the north, on the north side of the steep and precipitous Nahal Michmas stream, known in Arabic as Wadi es-Suweinit (&quot;valley of the little thorn-tree&quot; or &quot;the acacia&quot;).

==Biblical account==

The town is known by its connection with the Philistine war of Saul and Jonathan, as it was the site of the Battle of Michmash recounted in the Bible. In 1 Samuel 13 ‘And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin, but the Philistines encamped in Michmas. According to this record, with the element of surprise and with confidence in God&#x27;s help, King Saul&#x27;s son Jonathan and his armour-bearer attacked and killed many in the Philistines garrison, causing panic throughout and a Philistine rout.

It tells how Jonathan and his armor-bearer showed themselves ‘to the Philistines’ garrison’ on the other side, and how they passed two sharp rocks: ‘there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez and the name of the other Seneh.’ They clambered up the cliff and overpowered the garrison ‘within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plough.’ The main body of the enemy awakened by the mêlée thought they were surrounded by Saul&#x27;s troops and ‘melted away and they went on beating down one another.’

A divinely sent earthquake, the effects of which were noted by Saul&#x27;s watchmen, threw the Philistine camp into turmoil. By the time Saul and his men came on the scene, many of the Philistines had slaughtered one another in confusion and the rest had taken to flight.

==From Sennacherib to Maccabaeans==
Isaiah mentions the town in the context of Sennacherib&#x27;s invasion during the reign of Hezekiah (). After the captivity the men of the place returned (). At a later date it became the residence of Jonathan Maccabaeus and the seat of his government.

==Second Temple period==
Modern scholars have suggested that Michmas was a priestly settlement during the Second Temple period. It was inhabited up until Bar-Kokhba revolt, during the early 2nd century CE. The Mishnah teaches that the finest of the wheat used in the offering of the &quot;Omer&quot; was taken from Michmas and from Zanoah (&quot;Menachot&quot; 8:1).

During the 1980s, 4 clusters of tombs, consisting of roughly 70 burial caves, were found in the vicinity of modern-day Mukhmas. In one of the burial caves, an ancient graffiti of a seven-branched menorah was found, together with a Paleo-Hebrew inscription. In the 1990s, German researchers purchased a ossuary found in Mukhmas bearing the name ‘&quot;Shimeon L[evi]&quot;’, written in the Hebrew alphabet.

==World War I==
During World War I, British forces under the command of General Allenby were to face the Turks at the same location. Major Vivian Gilbert of the British army relates the story of an unnamed brigade major who was reading his Bible while contemplating the situation against the Ottoman forces. The brigade major remembered a town by the name of Michmash mentioned somewhere in the Bible. He found the verses, and discovered that there was a secret path around the town. He woke the brigadier general, and they found that the path still existed and was very lightly guarded. The British forces used this path to outmaneuver the Ottomans, and so took the town.

<text>Tectonophysics, a branch of geophysics, is the study of the physical processes that underlie tectonic deformation. This includes measurement or calculation of the stress- and strain fields on Earth’s surface and the rheologies of the crust, mantle, lithosphere and asthenosphere.

==Overview==

Tectonophysics is concerned with movements in the Earth&#x27;s crust and deformations over scales from meters to thousands of kilometers. These govern processes on local and regional scales and at structural boundaries, such as the destruction of continental crust (e.g. gravitational instability) and oceanic crust (e.g. subduction), convection in the Earth&#x27;s mantle (availability of melts), the course of continental drift, and second-order effects of plate tectonics such as thermal contraction of the lithosphere. This involves the measurement of a hierarchy of strains in rocks and plates as well as deformation rates; the study of laboratory analogues of natural systems; and the construction of models for the history of deformation.

==History==

Tectonophysics was adopted as the name of a new section of AGU on April 19, 1940, at AGU&#x27;s 21st Annual Meeting. According to the AGU website (https://tectonophysics.agu.org/agu-100/section-history/), using the words from Norman Bowen, the main goal of the tectonophysics section was to “designate this new borderline field between geophysics, physics and geology … for the solution of problems of tectonics.” Consequently, the claim below that the term was defined in 1954 by Gzolvskii is clearly incorrect. Since 1940 members of AGU had been presenting papers at AGU meetings, the contents of which defined the meaning of the field.

Tectonophysics was defined as a field in 1954 when Mikhail Vladimirovich Gzovskii published three papers in the journal &quot;Izvestiya Akad. Nauk SSSR, Sireya Geofizicheskaya&quot;: &quot;On the tasks and content of tectonophysics&quot;, &quot;Tectonic stress fields&quot;, and &quot;Modeling of tectonic stress fields&quot;. He defined the main goals of tectonophysical research to be study of the mechanisms of folding and faulting as well as large structural units of the Earth&#x27;s crust. He later created the Laboratory of Tectonophysics at the Institute of Physics of the Earth, Academy of Sciences of the USSR, Moscow.

== Applications ==
In coal mines, large amounts of horizontal stress on the rock (around two to three times greater than the vertical pressure from the overlying rock) are caused by tectonic stress and can be predicted with plate tectonics stress maps. For example, because West Virginia experiences tectonic stress from east to west, as of around the 1990s significantly more roof collapses occurred in mines running north to south than in mines running east to west.

<doc id="621888" wikidata="Q5232463" url="?curid=621888" title="David Coleman">
<text>David Robert Coleman OBE (26 April 1926 – 21 December 2013) was a British sports commentator and television presenter who worked for the BBC for 46 years. He covered eleven Summer Olympic Games from 1960 to 2000 and six FIFA World Cups from 1962 to 1982.

Coleman presented some of the BBC&#x27;s leading sporting programmes, including &quot;Grandstand&quot; and &quot;Sportsnight&quot; (originally titled &quot;Sportsnight with Coleman&quot; until 1972), and was the host of &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; for 18 years. He retired from the BBC in 2000. Later that year he became the first broadcaster to receive the Olympic Order award, in recognition of his contribution to the Olympic movement.

==Early life==
Born in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, of Irish heritage (his immediate family hailed from County Cork), Coleman competed as a schoolboy middle-distance runner. In 1949, he won the Manchester Mile as a member of Stockport Harriers, the only non-international runner to do so. He competed in the English National Cross-Country Championships for Manchester Athletic Club in 1952 (116th, 3rd team) and 1953 (118). He ran 440 yards (¼ mile) for Staffordshire. Injury eventually caused him to give up competitive running, and he later became president of the Wolverhampton &amp; Bilston Athletics Club.

Coleman worked as a reporter for the &quot;Stockport Express&quot;. In 1946 he was called up for national service. He served in the Royal Corps of Signals and worked for the British Army Newspaper Unit. Part of his time in national service was in Kenya. He joined Kemsley Newspapers after demobilisation and at 22 became editor of the &quot;Cheshire County Express&quot;. He did not attend the 1952 Olympic trials because of hamstring injuries. Instead he approached the BBC to see if they would like any help with athletics coverage. Although he did not have an audition, the BBC asked him to cover Roger Bannister at Bradford City Police Sports. The following year he began freelance radio work in Manchester.

==BBC==
In 1954 Coleman moved to Birmingham and joined the BBC as a news assistant and sports editor. His first television appearance was on &quot;Sportsview&quot;, on the day that Bannister broke the four-minute mile. In November 1955, he was appointed sports editor for the BBC&#x27;s Midlands Region.

===BBC Sports presenter===
In October 1958, the BBC&#x27;s Head of Sport Peter Dimmock recruited Coleman to be the presenter of the new Saturday afternoon sports programme &quot;Grandstand&quot;. He continued as the regular presenter until 1968. He also presented the &quot;BBC Sports Personality of the Year&quot; from 1961, and &quot;Sportsnight&quot; from 1968 to 1972 as well as other special sporting events such as the Grand National. He even covered the return of The Beatles from the United States and the 1959 General Election for the BBC from the Press Association headquarters.

As well as a presenter, Coleman was also a sports commentator. He presented and/or commentated on eleven Olympic Games from Rome 1960 to Sydney 2000, as well as eight Commonwealth Games. He covered a total of seven World Cups, both as a commentator and a presenter.

===Football===
Coleman covered as a secondary commentator for the 1970 World Cup behind Kenneth Wolstenholme but took over as BBC&#x27;s senior football commentator when Wolstenholme left in 1971. Coleman commentated on the World Cup Final in 1974 and 1978, the European Cup Final in 1973 and 1975 and the FA Cup final from 1972 to 1976 inclusive, although he missed the 1977 game because he was in a legal dispute with the BBC, allowing John Motson to make his FA Cup final debut. Coleman returned for the 1978 final before Motson took over the following year. Coleman&#x27;s last live football commentary was on 26 May 1979 when he described England&#x27;s 3–1 win over Scotland at Wembley Stadium in the 1978–79 British Home Championship, although he continued to work at football matches as a secondary commentator until October 1981 with his last game being a midweek League Cup game between Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United.

===Athletics===
In 1968, at the Mexico Olympics Coleman was recorded at 200 words per minute while commentating on David Hemery&#x27;s win in the 400m Hurdles. After the finish he could only identify the first two and exclaimed: &quot;Who cares who&#x27;s third?&quot; The bronze medal winner turned out to be another Briton, John Sherwood.

Satirists of the 1980s and 1990s often portrayed Coleman as constantly surprised by mundane happenings at athletic events. Clive James wrote that the difference between commentating and &#x27;Colemantating&#x27; is that &quot;a commentator says something you may wish to remember; a Colemantator says something you try to forget&quot;. However, Coleman&#x27;s ability to generate excitement through his commentary was widely praised. In 1972, he broadcast for several hours during the siege at the Munich Olympics as well as the memorial service days later. Coleman concentrated on athletics commentary from 1984.

===Tennis===
Coleman was a key member of BBC Television&#x27;s Wimbledon coverage from 1960 until 1969, hosting the live daytime coverage until 1969.

===Grand National===
Coleman presented coverage of the Grand National for 23 years, between 1961 and 1976 and again from 1978 to 1984. He was due to present the first in 1960 but had to step down due to illness. He was also absent from the 1977 Grand National, which turned out to be Red Rum&#x27;s historic third win, due to his contract dispute with the BBC.

===Other===
Coleman also hosted sports quiz show &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; for 18 years from 1979 to 1997, striking up a strong rapport with captains such as Emlyn Hughes, Ian Botham, Willie Carson and Bill Beaumont. Although he hosted the vast majority of the shows, he was occasionally absent and stand-in hosts were drafted in. Former host David Vine returned to the show in 1989 when Coleman was ill, Bill Beaumont hosted two editions in 1996, while Will Carling temporarily replaced Beaumont as team captain, and Sue Barker hosted two editions later that year.

Coleman&#x27;s on-air gaffes, use of clichés and occasional mispronunciations led the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; to name its sports bloopers column &quot;Colemanballs&quot; in his honour.

==Retirement==
Coleman retired from broadcasting after the 2000 Summer Olympics. In December 2000, he was presented with the Olympic Order by then-IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch in recognition of his services to the Olympic ideals. He retired, requesting no fanfare or recognition by the BBC, despite working for the corporation for over 40 years.

The BBC later broadcast a programme entitled &quot;The Quite Remarkable David Coleman&quot; to celebrate Coleman&#x27;s life, which was aired just after his 85th birthday in May 2011.

==Personal life and honours==
Coleman married Barbara Manning in 1952 in north-east Cheshire. They had six children. His daughter Anne (born 1954) was a British ladies&#x27; show jumping champion. His son Michael (born 1962) was a Panavia Tornado navigator, who flew in the Gulf War in 1991, and had become a Squadron Leader. They had twin sons in 1955 and two other daughters in 1961 and 1969. He lived in Warwickshire and Buckinghamshire through his life, and lived in Chippenham, Wiltshire, at the time of his death.

In the 1993 New Year Honours, Coleman was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). He was also given the Judges&#x27; Award For Sport in the 1996 Royal Television Society Awards. In 2000, he became the first journalist or broadcaster to be awarded the Olympic Order.

===Death===
Coleman died from complications of bronchopneumonia and a stroke at a hospital in Windsor, Berkshire, on 21 December 2013, at the age of 87.

<text>The British Aerospace 125 is a twinjet mid-size business jet. Originally developed by de Havilland and initially designated as the DH.125 Jet Dragon, it entered production as the Hawker Siddeley HS.125, which was the designation used until 1977. Later on, more recent variants of the type were marketed as the Hawker 800.

More than 60% of the total sales of the aircraft were to North American customers. It was also used by the Royal Air Force as a navigation trainer, as the Hawker Siddeley Dominie T1, and was operated by the United States Air Force as a calibration aircraft, under the designation C-29.

==Development==

===Origins===

In 1961, de Havilland began work upon a small business jet, then known as the &quot;DH.125 Jet Dragon&quot;, which was intended to replace the piston engined de Havilland Dove, a successful business aircraft and light transport. Prior to the start of the project, de Havilland had determined that a successful business jet would require several variables to be met, including a range of at least , the speed and cost factors of a suitable jet engine to outperform turboprop-propelled competitors, and an engineering philosophy that favoured reliability and conventionality. The design team settled on a twin-engine aircraft with the engines mounted on the rear fuselage. The Bristol Siddeley Viper turbojet powerplant was selected to power the type.

On 13 August 1962, the first of two prototypes conducted its first flight, a second aircraft followed it on 12 December that year. The second prototype was more aerodynamically representative of a production aircraft, and was fitted out with more equipment than the first prototype; the subsequent production-standard aircraft incorporated several changes and improvements from the prototypes, such as a longer fuselage and a greater wingspan. The first production-standard aircraft performed its first flight on 12 February 1963. The first delivery to a customer took place on 10 September 1964.

===Production===

The aircraft went through many designation changes during its service life. Hawker Siddeley had bought de Havilland the year before the project had started, but the legacy brand and &quot;DH&quot; designation was used throughout development. After the jet achieved full production, the name was changed to &quot;HS.125&quot; except for American exports which retained the &quot;DH.125&quot; until it was replaced by BH.125 for Beechcraft-Hawker. When Hawker Siddeley Aircraft merged with the British Aircraft Corporation to form British Aerospace in 1977, the name changed to &quot;BAe 125&quot;. When British Aerospace sold its Business Jets Division to Raytheon in 1993, the then-main variant of the jet became widely referred to as the &quot;Hawker 1000&quot;.

While the two prototypes were assembled at de Havilland&#x27;s Hatfield site, final assembly of all production aircraft would take place at the Broughton factory near Chester until the 1990s. By the 2000s, the fuselage, wings and tailfin of the aircraft were still being assembled and partially equipped in the Broughton site, now being owned and managed by Airbus UK; various sub-assemblies were also produced in Airbus UK&#x27;s Buckley facility. From 1996 onwards, the assembled sections and components were shipped to Wichita, Kansas in the United States, to undergo final assembly. Writing in 1993, Flying Magazine said of the type &quot;In numerical terms, the 125 series is the most successful British commercial aircraft ever built, and the world&#x27;s longest in-production business jet&quot;.

Production of the aircraft came to an abrupt halt in 2013 due to the bankruptcy of owner Hawker Beechcraft, who has suffered during the Great Recession of the late 2000s in which demand for business jets had slumped for a number of years. The type had been in production for more than 50 years when manufacturing stopped, during which time over 1,600 aircraft had been produced. In April 2013, the type certificate and support responsibility for all 125s built was transferred to the reformed Beechcraft Corporation. As of October 2012, Beechcraft does not intend to restart production of its business jet lines; instead the company intends to alternatively sell or dismantle the production facilities for the 125 family.

==Design==

The BAe 125 is a low-winged monoplane, powered by two engines mounted on the rear fuselage. It features a slightly swept wing, which is based on the larger de Havilland Comet wing planform, and uses large slotted flaps and airbrakes for operating from small airfields; the aircraft can be flown from hardened grass airstrips. The aircraft has a cylindrical fuselage with a one-piece wing mounted on the underside of the fuselage; most of the manufacturing and assembly work on the wing and fuselage is able to be done with them as separate items with the two being joined late in the production process. The wing has integral fuel tanks which contain most of the fuel.

Early models of the aircraft were powered by several versions of the Bristol Siddeley Viper turbojet engine, while later aircraft have adopted more recent turbofan powerplants such as the Garrett TFE731 and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW300. Both engines drive an electrical generator and hydraulic pump which supply power to the aircraft systems so in the event of a single engine failure, all aircraft systems continue to operate normally.

All control surfaces of the aircraft are aerodynamically balanced using set-back hinges and geared tabs. The flaps and airbrakes are operated hydraulically, while the ailerons, elevators, and rudder are manually operated. The design of the control circuits allows for a Collins-built A.P.103 autopilot to be incorporated. The aircraft is equipped with a de-icing system, which uses a mixture of bleed air from the engines, TKS fluid for general airframe, and AC electric windshield heating to prevent ice formation. Weather radar was incorporated into the aircraft&#x27;s avionics. The Royal Air Force equipped some of their aircraft with equipment to defend against attack by infra-red missiles.

The pressurised fuselage was designed to accommodate two pilots and six passengers. Various interiors were offered, with a high degree of passenger comfort. In an executive configuration, the flight deck is separated from the main passenger cabin; the single entrance of the aircraft, located directly behind the cockpit and forward of the passenger cabin, forms a vestibule area in which luggage can be stored and meals prepared during flight. An unobstructed cabin floor with of headroom and a wide cabin door also allowed the loading of bulky equipment, which was seen as particularly attractive to military operators. However, the internal &quot;up and over&quot; door was replaced on the Series 400 and thereafter by a more usual outward opening door with built-in steps. An emergency overwing exit hatch is located in the passenger cabin midsection over the starboard wing (although some versions have both port and starboard exits). The rear of the fuselage has a large equipment bay and, on some aircraft, one or two additional fuel tanks for extended operations.

==Operational history==
Having entered service as one of the first-generation executive jets, the British Aerospace 125 has been operated by a wide variety of customers, ranging from government and military operators to private customers and businesses, it has also seen use by several airlines. Many of the aircraft&#x27;s customers have been located in North America; in 1990, out of the 650 aircraft then being operated, more than 400 were being flown in the United States. Reportedly, one aircraft was being sold every seven working days for a substantial period of the type&#x27;s production life. Successively larger versions were introduced to extend the type&#x27;s appeal and to better compete against larger jets being used for business travel, such as the Gulfstream IV and Falcon 900.

The Royal Air Force was a significant early operator of the type, receiving 20 aircraft equipped as a navigation trainer and designated &quot;Hawker Siddeley Dominie T.1&quot;. The type entered service in 1965, with the surviving aircraft upgraded in 1996 to be more suitable for training crews for modern aircraft, with a new radar fitted. The Dominie served in excess of 45 years before being retired in 2011 due to diminishing requirements. Additional 125s were acquired and operated by No. 32 Squadron RAF as communications and light transport aircraft; these were also occasionally operated to transport Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the British Royal Family. In the later stages of the War in Afghanistan, various 125s were used to transport military officers and other key personnel in and out of the country. The type was scheduled to be withdrawn from RAF service by 2022, but was withdrawn in 2015.

By the early 1990s, British Aerospace, the manufacturer of the type at this point, had two main variants of the aircraft in production; the smaller 125-800 and larger 125–1000. The 125–1000, which conducted its first flight on 16 June 1990, had several changes to give the type a reported intercontinental range, including the adoption of the newly developed Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW300 engine and new digital avionics, such as FADEC. Following Raytheon&#x27;s purchase of British Aerospace&#x27;s Business Jet Division during the 1990s, the two in-production variants were re-designated as the Hawker 800 and Hawker 1000 respectively.

The 125 is the only business jet to have been hijacked: in 1967, a chartered 125 carrying the former Congolese Prime Minister Moise Tshombe was diverted to Algeria by armed persons on board. The 125 is also likely to be the only business aircraft to survive being hit by an air-to-air missile: in August 1988, a British Aerospace 125-800 transporting Botswana President Quett Masire was struck by a missile launched by a nearby Angolan Mig-23, apparently inadvertently. While badly damaged by the direct hit (which resulted in the loss of an engine, decompression of the cabin, and rupture of its fuel tanks) the aircraft was successfully landed by BAe demonstrator pilot Arthur Ricketts. It was later rebuilt.

In 2013, the FAA modified its rules to prohibit the operation of jets weighing or less that are not stage 3 noise compliant, specifically mentioning the 125 series of aircraft. This required any aircraft of the type either to have compliant engines installed, or to be fitted with a hush kit, to fly over most of the United States after 31 December 2015.

*On 7 August 1988, a BAe-125 owned by the Botswana Government was carrying the President of Botswana, Quett Masire, and his staff to a meeting in Luanda. An Angolan MiG-23 pilot fired two R-60 (AA-8) missiles at the plane. One missile hit the no. 2 engine, causing it to fall off the aircraft. The second missile then hit the falling engine.

<text>South Fork Kentucky River is a river in Kentucky in the United States.
It is a fork of the Kentucky River that it joins just downstream of Beattyville.
It was not originally named South Fork.
Two of its three major tributaries are the forks at its head, the Red Bird River and Goose Creek, whose confluence is at Oneida.

Before the 19th century, Goose Creek also incorporated what is today known as South Fork Kentucky River.
== Navigability ==

Several largely ineffective attempts were made in the 19th century to make South Fork navigable all of the way upstream to the Goose Creek Salt Works.
An Act of the legislature on 1811-01-10 enabled a lottery to raise towards making this reach of the river navigable, and several times the scheme was allowed more time, but by 1813 still nothing had come of it.
Between 1837 and 1845 was spent clearing obstructions from this reach.

One of the biggest impediments was an area known as The Narrows, a reach of the river downstream of the Goose Creek/Red Bird fork where it descended by .

== Basin and hydrology ==
A survey of the reach between the Salt Works and the Soft Fork mouth was performed in 1836–1837.
It recorded the entire length as descending in total, with the South Fork portion being and of that.
It recorded the width as varying between .
=== Floods ===

The Kentucky River basin, including South Fork and its tributaries, suffered a major flood in January and February 1957, although that did not exceed the highest on record for South Fork specifically, as Goose Creek&#x27;s record at that point had been the flood of June and July 1947.
Peak water levels at Manchester were lower than those of the 1947 flood.
However at Booneville the peak levels were higher than those of 1947.

25 homes and 34 commercial buildings were flooded in Manchester; with an estimate cost of the damage exceeding .
20 homes and 10 other buildings were flooded in Oneida, with approximately 80% of the town under water, in some places by as much as .
31 homes and 1 other building were flooded in Booneville.

== Tributaries and other locations ==

<doc id="621896" wikidata="Q2741834" url="?curid=621896" title="Llanidloes">
<text>Llanidloes () is a town and community on the A470 and B4518 roads in Powys, within the historic county boundaries of Montgomeryshire (), Wales. The population in 2011 was 2,929, of whom 15% could speak Welsh. It is the third largest settlement in Montgomeryshire, after Newtown and Welshpool.

It is the first town on the River Severn (), counting from the source. The town&#x27;s Member of Parliament is Steve Witherden of the Labour Party (MP since 2024) and its Member of the Senedd is Russell George of the Conservatives (MS since 2011).

==Surroundings==

The town is close to the large dam and reservoir Llyn Clywedog. There is a scenic mountain road connecting Machynlleth and Llanidloes.

Llanidloes is popular with hikers who walk on the scenic footpaths surrounding the town, including Glyndŵr&#x27;s Way, which in conjunction with the Offa&#x27;s Dyke path forms a 160-mile circuit around Mid Wales and local passage over the spine of the Cambrian Mountains.

The Sarn Sabrina Walk – a 25-mile circular walk from Llanidloes to the source of the Severn and back – has been held yearly on the Saturday preceding the Late Spring Bank Holiday since 2006. In 2007 the Semi Sabrina, a 12-mile circular walk, was added.
The Hafren Forest is also used for car rallies such as Rally GB and motorcycle Enduro events throughout the year.

==History==
Llanidloes takes its name from the early 7th century Celtic Saint Idloes (Llan-Idloes = the Parish of St Idloes), after whom its parish church is named. The village hall is the centre of Wales. The town was then part of the cantref of Arwystli. In 1280 Llanidloes received a market charter from the king (granted to Owen de la Pole) and benefited from Edwardian town planning and earthwork defences. The present-day street plan follows the 13th century grid layout. O&#x27;Neill traced earth bank defences from the confluence of the Severn with the Clywedog and along Brook Street on the north, beyond High Street on the east, and along Mount Street on the south; with the Severn forming the western boundary. He suggested that the medieval castle with its bailey lay immediately to the south in the area of Mount Street. However, the precise position of the castle and earthen bank defences needs to be verified by archaeological evidence. The town prospered and was granted borough status in 1344. Revival after the Glyndŵr Rising was slow, but there were 59 taxpayers in 1545.

The following centuries saw the growth of weaving and flannel production. This was essentially a cottage industry, and the local products were sent to market at Shrewsbury in England. Towards the end of the 18th century, Llanidloes was the largest producer in Montgomeryshire, but after about 1810, with the introduction of factories, which brought all the processes under one roof, Newtown gradually overtook Llanidloes as the main centre. Some of the three-storey houses with brick façades of this period would have housed weaving lofts on the upper storey. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Topographical Dictionary&quot; of 1833 noted that there were &quot;forty carding engines, eighteen fulling mills and thirty-five thousand spindles .. affording considerable employment in Llanidloes.&quot; However, the new technology was far from profitable, and the factory system led to increasing unrest, which culminated in the Chartist riots in 1839. Newtown, connected to the Montgomeryshire Canal in 1819, soon became the centre of the flannel industry in Wales with the opening of its Flannel Exchange in 1832. Llanidloes followed suit in 1838 when former Public Rooms in Great Oak Street were built by a local consortium as a Flannel Exchange; but this only lasted a few years, although Llanidloes flannel was regarded as better quality. Some owners, particularly Thomas Jones, who owned the Cambrian and Spring Mills, struggled to promote the Llanidloes flannel industry.

Lead mining became the more profitable industry from 1865, when rich deposits were discovered at the Van mines. By 1876, the mines were among the most productive in the world, employing over 500. Important too was the town&#x27;s iron foundry, established in 1851. This second phase of prosperity is well reflected in the townscape, most notably in the proliferation of fine chapels, built during the 1870s. Commercial success is reflected by the many fine shopfronts that survive from the later part of the 19th century; but again decline set in: printing and tanning gained in importance, but the last of the mines closed in 1921. Little has changed since then, except the building of houses, including a Garden Suburb and a new school. The building of the by-pass in 1991, along the track of the former railway, has largely protected the town from the ravages of traffic. Llanidloes has attractive tree-lined main streets, originally planted in 1901, although many of the trees have been replaced. The vibrant community, pleasantly varied streetscape and attractive setting make Llanidloes one of the nicest towns in Wales.

===The Chartist uprising===
Llanidloes was notorious as a focus of industrial unrest during the Chartist revolt in 1839, a campaign for democratic rights prompted by the collapse of the local textile industry. During the unrest, three local people were arrested and held in the Trewythen hotel on Great Oak Street until the protesters forced their release. The town was controlled by the protesters until a detachment of South Shropshire Yeomanry arrived on 14 May 1839 and restored Government authority.

==Churches and chapels==
*The parish church of St Idloes (Church in Wales). The 15th-century tower has walls of large stones 7 ft thick. There is an Early Perpendicular west doorway. Timbered belfry with pyramidal roof, which has been dated to 1594 by tree rings. Inside at belfry level a rib-vault with random slate infill; in its centre is the opening for raising bells. Street rebuilt the north aisle, reusing the early 16th century panel-traceried east window, and replaced the other windows with Perpendicular tracery. Attached to the north-west of the church is the church hall of 1982 by Phillip G. Harrison. The splendid solemn arcade in the aisle is part of the fourteen-bay aisled nave of the Cistercian church at Abbey Cwmhir, some 10 miles SW across the hills. There is no doubt that the material was carted away after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and re-erected in slightly jumbled order at Llanidloes. The hammer-beam roof is the most elaborate in Montgomeryshire. Hammer beams on carved spandrel-pieces support curved ribs and principals, forming a sort of airy tunnel-vault. The framing is all delicately moulded. This type of roof often dates from the 15th century, but there is no reason to doubt the date of 1542 (on the ninth shield from the NE) as dendrochronology has proved that the timbers were felled in 1538. The corbels are odd masonry pieces including stiff-leaf from Cwmhir. The base of each bracket is carved, with an archer, or grotesque heads. Winged angels holding shields are fixed to each hammer beam.
*Trinity United Reformed Church, Shortbridge Street, formerly Sion Independent Chapel. Built in 1878 by John Humphreys of Swansea, a notable chapel builder. Set back within its plot to great effect. The three-bay façade has giant classical columns carrying arcading, with a pediment above. Rock-faced masonry with a smooth ashlar band over the trio of doorways containing plain lights for the lobby. Tall windows above with Florentine wooden tracery. The varnished pine interior contains raked seating. The gallery, continuous round all four sides, has a band of cast iron foliagework over boarding, with an organ above the pulpit. Pulpit with arcaded front. It cost £1,550 to build.
*Church of Our Lady and St Richard Gwyn (Roman Catholic). Built in the 1950s next to the Franciscan friary on Penygreen Road. First Mass was celebrated at the church on the 18 October 1959.

==Structures in Llanidloes==
===Buildings===
*The half-timbered Old Market Hall stands at the crossroads of the four streets of the original medieval town. Built around 1600, it is the only surviving building of this type in Wales. Assize courts were held in the hall around 1605, and John Wesley preached from a pulpit stone on the open ground floor in 1748.
*Llanidloes Town Hall, Broad Street, designed by the architects Shayler and Ridge in 1908. Faced in Cefn stone from Minera. Frank Shayler was a notable Arts and Crafts architect and this is one of the best examples of his work. The Town Hall now contains the Llanidloes Museum.

===Bridges===
*Two masonry arch bridges, the Long Bridge and the Short Bridge, were designed by Thomas Penson. The former is a 3-arch bridge built in 1826 over the confluence of the Rivers Severn and Clywedog and is currently Grade II listed. It replaced a mid 18th-century wooden bridge, also called Long Bridge. Short Bridge is a single arch masonry bridge over the River Severn, dating from 1849.

===The railway station and the Newtown and Llanidloes Railway===

Llanidloes railway station was opened in 1864 by the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway. Designed as a grand junction station, it was to connect the Mid-Wales Railway and the Manchester and Milford Railway in the south, with Newtown and the Oswestry and Newtown Railway to the north. Designed to hold the railway company&#x27;s offices, the building is in the Georgian style. The Llanidloes and Newtown railway eventually formed part of the Cambrian Railways, linking it with South Wales. The station closed for passengers on 31 December 1962. The Llanidloes by-pass road runs along a section of the former railway, and the station still stands beside this road. It is now restored and occupied by small businesses.

===Llanidloes War Memorial Hospital===
Opened in 1920 as a memorial to local servicemen who died in World War I. In 2006, Powys Local Health Board (LHB) announced that it was planning to make cuts which would result in the downgrading or closure of Llanidloes War Memorial Hospital. The Save Llanidloes Hospital Action Group was formed in response.

==Culture==
The town became noted for an annual Llanidloes Fancy Dress street party it hosted, which was one of the largest street parties in Wales. The event started in 1969, taking place on the first Friday of July. In 2004 around 5,000 people took part in the festival. The 2005 event was temporarily cancelled due to the costs of safety provisions, but a local councillor provided funding for training of stewards and for public toilets. After concerns linked to costs and public safety the festival was cancelled in 2012.

Llanidloes has a reputation as a very &quot;quirky&quot; town, known for its liberal, counterculture atmosphere. Llanidloes is known as a popular home for ageing hippies.

In 2014, it was rated one of the most attractive postcode areas to live in Wales. It was named one of the best places to live in Wales in 2017.

The headquarters of The Quilt Association is at the Minerva Arts Centre; here they hold workshops and an annual exhibition of quilts.

==Sport==
Llanidloes Town Football Club was established in 1875. In 2020 they were promoted to Cymru North, in the second tier of the Welsh football league system.

The local rugby union team is Llanidloes RFC.

Llanidloes hosts the WEC GP of Wales, an event in the Enduro World Championship, an off-road motorcycle sport.

==Education==

Llanidloes High School is a secondary school.

<doc id="621900" wikidata="Q4802876" url="?curid=621900" title="As Good as Dead (album)">
<text>As Good as Dead is the second studio album by American rock band Local H. Following lackluster sales of their debut, &quot;Ham Fisted&quot;, and under pressure from their label Island Records, the band quickly returned to the studio to record their follow-up. Released on April 16, 1996, &quot;As Good as Dead&quot; is a concept album about dead-end, small-town life based on the band&#x27;s origins in Zion, Illinois. The album was positively received by critics and became an unexpected success behind its second single, &quot;Bound for the Floor&quot;, and it ultimately sold over 320,000 copies. &quot;As Good as Dead&quot; produced three other singles: &quot;High-Fiving MF&quot;, &quot;Eddie Vedder&quot;, and &quot;Fritz&#x27;s Corner&quot;. It remains Local H&#x27;s best-selling album to date.

== Background ==
In 1994, with record labels trying to capitalize on the popularity of grunge and alternative rock bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden, Local H caught the attention of Polydor Records, which was then in the process of merging with Island Records. Island released the band&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Ham Fisted&quot;, the following year, but it sold below expectations and Island pressured the band&#x27;s A&amp;R rep, Joe Bosso, to drop them. Instead, Bosso pushed them into quickly recording a follow-up before Island could cancel their contract. Ahead of the release of &quot;As Good as Dead&quot;, frontman Scott Lucas was informed by Island that the album needed to sell at least 100,000 copies for the band to remain with the label.

== Release ==
&quot;As Good as Dead&quot; was released on April 16, 1996, following the lead single &quot;High-Fiving MF&quot;, which failed to chart. The band, however, found greater success with the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Bound for the Floor&quot;, which rose to No. 5 on the US Alternative &quot;Billboard&quot; Chart and No. 10 on the US Hot Mainstream Rock &quot;Billboard&quot; Chart, and propelled the album into selling over 320,000 copies and a peak of No. 147 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. The songs &quot;Eddie Vedder&quot; and &quot;Fritz&#x27;s Corner&quot; additionally made the Top 40 on the Alternative and Mainstream Rock Billboard Charts. Encouraged by the unexpected success of &quot;As Good as Dead&quot;, Island Records greenlit a third album, &quot;Pack Up the Cats&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
Upon its release, critics greeted &quot;As Good as Dead&quot; with generally positive reviews. In a four-star review, AllMusic stated that with &quot;As Good as Dead&quot; Local H stood apart from other rock bands signed in the wake of Nirvana, noting that in exploring the album&#x27;s &quot;litany of bitterness over a life that&#x27;s being wasted before your very eyes,&quot; frontman Scott Lucas was one of only a few artists who could approach the &quot;emotional resonance&quot; of Kurt Cobain. Similarly, &quot;New Noise Magazine&quot; stated in a five-star review that it was a mistake to lump Local H in with other bands signed in the wake of grunge, writing, &quot;&quot;As Good As Dead&quot; matches the sentiment of the era, but comes from a much more sincere place.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; awarded the album an A- rating and complimented the band for their &quot;isometric power—that sense of tremendous force bravely exerted against implacable reality.&quot; Sputnikmusic deemed the album a &quot;wonderful slice of apathy and cynicism that&#x27;s just as punk-oriented as it is grunge-oriented.&quot;

<text>The Hawker 800 is a mid-size twinjet corporate aircraft. It is a development of the British Aerospace 125, and was assembled by Hawker Beechcraft.

==Development==
In April 1981, the British Aerospace (BAe) board sanctioned the programme to improve the British Aerospace 125-700 series. By May 1983 the new aircraft was ready for its first test flight.

The BAe 125-800 series has a number of modifications and changes over the 700, the most noticeable being the redesigned cockpit windscreen. Accompanying this are a modified rear fuselage fairing, as well as a glass cockpit and uprated (from 3,700 to 4,300 lb thrust) Garrett TFE731-5R-1H engines. British Aerospace also improved the wing by incorporating new outer wing sections. This helped to reduce drag and improve aerodynamic efficiency.

The 125-800 series would become a sales success. From the first BAe 125 flight in August 1961 it took nineteen years until the 500th airframe was sold. In a little over five years, British Aerospace were registering the 200th sale of the 800 series.

In 1994 Raytheon (which bought Beech Aircraft Corporation in 1980) acquired BAe Corporate Jets. The new entity was known as Raytheon Aircraft. In March 2007, Raytheon divested its aircraft manufacturing business to Hawker Beechcraft Corp., a company formed and controlled by GS Capital Partners and Onex Partners of Canada.

The last version was the Hawker 850XP, which was certified for operation in March 2006. The 850XP is identical to the 800XP except that it includes winglets, which have extended its operating range by . This version also incorporates upgraded avionics and a redesigned interior. The Hawker 850XP essentially fills the gap left behind by the Hawker 1000 when production of that aircraft ceased.
In 2006, its unit cost was $13,786,100.

Two new variants were announced in October 2006 for future deliveries:
* The Hawker 750, in which the ventral fuel tank is replaced by an externally accessed baggage pannier, which reduces range slightly.
* The , using new Honeywell TFE731-50BR engines for increased range. In 2012, its unit cost was US$ 16.07 million.

After the 2013 bankruptcy of Hawker Beechcraft, the surviving company, Beechcraft, discontinued its business jet range, including the 800 series, although the designs are still supported for parts.

By 2018, a 1980s-era 700s was priced for less than $500,000, a 1995 800A at $1.02 million and a 2012 900XP at $6 million.

==Design==

The Hawker 800 was similar to most modern airframes in requiring sub-assemblies to be constructed away from the final point of manufacture. The fuselage sections, wings and control surfaces were manufactured and assembled in the United Kingdom in a combination of Hawker Beechcraft&#x27;s own facility and those owned by Airbus UK, which inherited much of BAE Systems&#x27;s civil aircraft manufacturing capacity. These sections are partially fitted out and installed with control surfacing and major systems before being shipped to Hawker Beechcraft&#x27;s main manufacturing site in Wichita, Kansas for final assembly, fitting out and testing.

===Military variants===
Japan uses a maritime search and rescue variant of the Hawker 800. It is designated U-125A in Japan Air Self-Defense Force service. This variant has large observation windows, a flare and marker-buoy dispenser system, a life-raft and emergency equipment dropping system, and enhanced salt water corrosion prevention. The aircraft also has a Toshiba 360-degree search radar, Melco thermal imaging equipment, and other military communications equipment for its mission.

A military version of the Hawker 800XP is in use by South Korea for tactical aerial reconnaissance, surveillance and SIGINT (SIGnals INTelligence) tasks, and 8 specially equipped aircraft were delivered in 2000. The Republic of Korea Air Force calls them RC-800s, and they are based at Seoul Air Base.

==Variants==

* Hawker 750

With 48 built, this lower-cost, lighter-weight and shorter-range version of the 800XP competes with the Citation XLS and Learjet 60.
In November 2017, used prices range from $2.2 million for early 2008 models to 3.8 million for late 2011 models.
Its larger cabin is typically configured with eight seats in double club or a four chair club followed by a three-place divan facing a single seat, and is pressurized by to provide a cabin altitude at FL 410.
Its ventral fuel tank is replaced with a external baggage compartment, leaving of fuel in the wet wings.
The cockpit has four-screen Rockwell Collins Pro Line 21 avionics and FMS-6000.

It takes off in at MTOW/Sea level.
With a 20° quarter chord wing sweep, its maximum speed is Mach 0.80, it cruises at Mach 0.74 to 0.78 and long-range cruise is Mach 0.70 at per hour midweight.
First hour fuel burn is , second hour is for subsequent hours.

B-checks are every 800 h, C-checks every 1,600 h and D-checks every 3,200 h and there are yearly maintenance checks.
The landing gear is overhauled every 12 years.
Its Honeywell TFE731-5BR have 2,100 h and 4,200 h inspection intervals, extendable to 2,500 h / 5,000 h with optional service bulletins, and MSP per engine.

==Accidents and incidents==
* 31 July 2008: A Hawker 800 registered as N818MV and operating as East Coast Jets Flight 81, crashed while attempting a go-around at Owatonna Degner Regional Airport near Owatonna, Minnesota, killing all eight passengers and crew on board. The aircraft was manufactured in 1991, and East Coast Jets began operating it in June 2003. The NTSB determined the probable cause of the accident was the captain’s decision to attempt a go-around late in the landing roll with insufficient runway remaining. Contributing to the accident were (1) the pilots’ poor crew coordination and lack of cockpit discipline; (2) fatigue, which likely impaired both pilots’ performance; and (3) the failure of the FAA to require crew resource management training and standard operating procedures for Part 135 operators.
* 10 November 2015: A Hawker 800 operating as ExecuFlight Flight 1526 crashed into an apartment complex in Akron, Ohio shortly before 15:00 EST in rainy weather while on approach to Akron Fulton International Airport. Witnesses reported hearing a loud explosion, and seeing smoke/flames as the crash occurred. All nine occupants of the aircraft, including both pilots, were killed. The National Transportation Safety Board reported the crash was caused by pilot error, operational issues within the charter company, and deficiencies in the FAA&#x27;s oversight (operations inspections) of the charter operator.
* 20 December 2020: A Hawker 800XP crashed near Farmingdale, New York. At 8:35 p.m. EST the aircraft faced substantial damage; the captain sustained minor injuries, and the first officer was seriously injured. The plane was a Part 91 business flight operated by Talon Air, LLC as a Title 14 CFR.
* 21 February 2022: A Hawker 800XP skidded off Runway 33 at Aspen-Pitkin County Airport (ASE) due to aborted takeoff due to lack of control pressure. Four passengers and two pilots were not injured. 
* 7 February 2024: A Hawker 900XP crashed in Grand County, Utah near the Utah-Colorado border after takeoff from Grand Junction Regional Airport. The two pilots were killed. The aircraft was owned by Vici Aviation LLC and operated by Clay Lacy Aviation.

<text>The Bergamasco Shepherd, , is an Italian breed of sheepdog. It originated in the Alpi e Prealpi Bergamasche, where it was used as a herding dog for both sheep and cattle.

== History ==

The origins of the Pastore Bergamasco are unknown. A genetic study in 2018 found evidence of haplotypes shared with other European breeds including the Berger Picard, the Bernese Mountain Dog and the Briard.

A dog of this type was exhibited at the first Italian dog show in Milan in 1881. The first registration of the breed in the Libro Origini Italiano, the Italian national stud-book for dogs, was in 1891. A breed association, now called the , was established in 1949. The breed was recognised by the Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiana in 1956, and was definitively accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in the same year.

In the nine years from 2011 to 2019, annual registrations in Italy averaged 97 per year, with a maximum of 149 and a minimum of 48.

== Characteristics ==
The Bergamasco is a robust and rustic dog of medium size, solidly built and well proportioned. It is roughly square in outline when seen from the side – the length of the body is approximately equal to the height at the withers. Dogs stand some at the withers, and weigh about ; bitches are about smaller, and weigh on average less.

It is characterised by a long thick coat which covers every part of the dog. Particularly on the hind part of the body, the coat forms long matted locks which provide good protection from bad weather; on the fore part of the body the hair is coarse and forms wavy ringlets like those of a goat, while the hair on the head is rather finer. The coat may be of any shade of grey, from very pale to matt black; some tinges of isabella or fulvous colour are allowable.

<text>Middle Fork Kentucky River is a river in Kentucky in the United States.
It is a fork of the Kentucky River that it joins just upstream of Beattyville.


== Basin and hydrology ==
=== Floods ===

The Kentucky River basin, including Middle Fork and its tributaries, suffered a major flood in January and February 1957.
Peak flood levels were higher by at Buckhorn and at Tallega than the previous record peak levels in 1939.
One person was drowned in Cutshin Creek.

Most of the urban damage was at Buckhorn, with properties under up to of water, and at Hyden.
In Bockhorn 10 homes were destroyed, and in Hyden 30% of the homes were damaged in some way.
20 commercial buildings in Hyden were flooded, and the local lumber company had a lot of its stock swept away.

The confluence of Bull Creek, the main Middle Fork, and Cutshin Creek was known in the 19th century in Kentucky as a &quot;turkeyfoot&quot;.

=== Hell-For-Certain Creek and Osha, Omarsville/Kaliopi post offices ===
The name of Hell-For-Certain Creek comes, anecdotally, from the bad experience of a pair of travellers navigating its waters.
It is a common favourite name to use in stories about travelling in Kentucky, although the eye dialect pronunciation of &quot;Hell For Sartin&quot; that is employed by storytellers is incorrect and considered offensive and insulting by native Kentuckyans.

The Osha post office was established by postmaster William C. &quot;Short Buckel Bill&quot; Begley on 1906-09-15.
Begley had originally wanted the name Hell For Certain after the creek, but this was rejected by the USPS, so his second choice was the name of his daughter (1893–1990).
It was located at the mouth of Hell-for-Certain Creek, and closed in December 1907.

The Omarsville post office was established on 1929-02-27 by postmaster Lilbern W. Woods.
It was named after Omar Huff, the son of Republican Party official Elmer Huff.
Originally located at the mouth of Mill Branch, it moved around several times over the years.
It was at several sites on Big Fork, then in 1942 postmasters Ethel Pilatos (née Woods and Lilbern&#x27;s sister) and her husband Sam Pilatos (an immigrant from Greece) moved it to the site of Sam&#x27;s store that, then was and still now is, located at the mouth of Devils Jump and called The Mouth of Devils Jump Branch.
Because of other similarly named post offices and mail being misdirected, on 1945-03-01 Omarsville was renamed Kaliopi after Sam&#x27;s mother (c.f. Calliope).
It closed in July 1981.

=== Dryhill and Gad/Thousandsticks post offices on Bull Creek ===
The Dryhill post office was established on 1897-09-30 by postmaster Dan McDaniel.
It was located on a literally &quot;dry hill&quot; just above the &quot;turkeyfoot&quot; confluence of Bull Creek, Middle Fork, and Cutshin Creek, where the Daniel Boone Parkway and Kentucky Route 257 now cross Middle Fork.
Like Omarsville, it served a store located at the mouth of Bull Creek and called The Mouth of Bull Creek.
It closed in July 1908, and McDaniel tried to reestablish it on 1910-08-13, this time using his own surname.
However, that name was taken in Breckenridge County so he continued with the original Dryhill.
It became a rural branch of Hyden post office in 1964.

The Gad post office was established on 1905-03-01 by postmaster Polly Osborne.
She had originally wanted the name Bull Creek but that was taken and so she chose Gad after the Tribe of Gad or Gad.
It was originally located a slight distance upstream on Henry Fork, and on 1924-05-31 moved to Bull Creek itself at the mouth of Thousandsticks Creek, after which it was at the same time renamed.
It closed in November 2004.

Thousandsticks post office, the creek it was renamed after, a school, church, the local weekly newspaper in Hyden, and Thousandsticks Mountain after which they all were named, have two different origin stories for their names.
The first is that early settlers found a large number of old dead trees in the area and so named it after the &quot;thousand sticks&quot;, i.e. tree trunks.
The second is that early travellers discovered the aftermath of a forest fire in the area and so named it after the &quot;thousand sticks&quot;, i.e. charred tree stumps.

Kentucky Route 118, which joins the Daniel Boone Parkway at Thousandsticks, is called the &quot;Hyden Spur&quot; as it is the access road for Hyden.

=== General ===
In 1918, Howard Asher and Rene Asher had mines on Red Bird just downstream of the ford that is downstream of Asher Branch.
Andrew Asher had one on Banger Branch; and Hughes Asher one on Roberts Branch.

Nathanial Roberts&#x27;s mine was on Roberts Branch.

<doc id="621915" wikidata="Q2254730" url="?curid=621915" title="Knighton, Powys">
<text>Knighton ( or ) is a market town and community on the River Teme, straddling the border between Powys, Wales and Shropshire, England. It lies in the traditional county of Radnorshire. Originally an Anglo-Saxon settlement, Knighton is located on Offa&#x27;s Dyke, the ancient earthwork that divided the two countries. It later became a Norman defensive border town.

==Toponymy==
The Welsh name, &quot;Tref-y-clawdd&quot;, meaning and referring to &quot;town on the dyke&quot;, was first recorded in 1262 and officially given to the town in 1971.

The name Knighton probably derives from the Old English (a soldier, thane or freeman) and (farm, settlement or homestead), and may have been founded through a grant of land to freemen.

==History==
Knighton&#x27;s earliest history is obscure, despite some local clues: Caer Caradoc (an Iron Age hill fort associated with Caradoc or Caractacus) is away, off the road to Clun. Watling Street, a Roman road, passes a few miles to the east at Leintwardine. Any settlements in the Knighton area would have belonged to the Iron Age kingdom of Cornovii, which coincided with the modern counties of Cheshire, Shropshire, North Staffordshire, North Herefordshire, and parts of Powys and Worcestershire.

Knighton includes a preserved section of Offa&#x27;s Dyke. The parallel Wat&#x27;s Dyke a few miles to the east, runs north and south along the English/Welsh border from Basingwerk near Holywell to Oswestry. Dykes aside, two Norman castles, earthen mottes, likely to be from 12th and 13th centuries, are the oldest surviving structures in modern Knighton. There is disagreement about the chronology of the two castles, although the earlier is likely to be the one above the town in Castle Road, with its more defensible position, wider panorama and clear evidence of a bailey. The first castle built here would also have overlooked the market place in Market Street and the town planned between Broad Street and St Edwards Church.

The town became a borough in 1203, with a charter permitting a weekly market and annual fair. The presence of two castles within a comparatively small town suggests that one (the earlier motte and bailey sited atop the town) went out of use before the establishment of the second (the motte with no bailey at Bryn y Castell). As Knighton Castle was captured and destroyed by Llewelyn ap Gruffyd in 1262, it seems likely that the second, later castle at Bryn y Castell was undertaken after that and was likely sited on lower ground so as to guard the crossing point of the River Teme. Bryn y Castell, as the one surviving castle in Knighton by then, was besieged by Owain Glyndŵr in 1402 and destroyed along with much of the town. The major battle of the rebellion was fought in the same year at Pilleth (Welsh: Bryn Glas) , south of the town. Though documents pertaining to the defence of Knighton during the Glyndwr rebellion state that Knighton had stout and defensible walls, no historical, archaeological or topographic evidence for a town wall, even of timber, has been found. So it is thought more likely that the statement referred to the castle walls, rather than the town.

The town church dates from the 11th century, but much of it was rebuilt in the 19th century. It is one of only two in Wales dedicated to St Edward, patron saint of England before St George was chosen. This English dedication is a symptom of the dual English/Welsh nature of the town, which was not legally resolved until 1535, when Knighton was finally confirmed as part of Wales by the Acts of Union. Knighton also has a Baptist chapel and a small Catholic church.
Knighton first prospered as a centre of the wool trade in the 15th century and was later an important point on the two drover routes from Montgomery to Hereford, and from London to Aberystwyth. Otherwise, Knighton was remote from centres of commerce.

It seemed likely that the railways would also fail to reach the town; the 1840s and 1850s saw rapid railway building right across Great Britain, but Radnorshire had a small population and little industry. Construction of a railway was made economically just viable by an entrepreneurial drive to connect the Mumbles and Milford Haven with the cities and factories of the industrial Midlands. The Knighton Railway Company was formed by local landowners and businessmen to build a line from Craven Arms to the town. Work began in August 1858 and the line reached Knighton in March 1861. The station itself ensued in 1865.

To mark the accession of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, the initials &quot;ER&quot; were planted in deciduous trees in an evergreen forest on a hill to the north of the town.

In August 1970, Knighton hosted a rock festival with bands such as The Move, along with Pete Brown &amp; Piblokto, Roger Bunn, Forever More, Clark-Hutchinson, James Litherland&#x27;s Brotherhood (James was originally part of Colosseum) and Killing Floor. The compères were radio DJ Pete Drummond and local resident and bluesman Alexis Korner, who also performed.

After the Acts of Union, Knighton belonged for nearly 450 years to the traditional County of Radnorshire. This, like several other counties, ceased to exist in 1974, being merged into the county of Powys.

The town council of 13 councillors elects once a year a largely ceremonial mayor.

Real municipal authority lies with Powys County Council. Knighton electoral ward was represented by two county councillors on Powys County Council until 1999, then only one. These have been Independent councillors or Liberal Democrats. Since May 2021, Knighton has joined with Beguildy to return 2 County Councillors, and it has been represented by the Independent Ange Williams and Liberal Democrat Corinna Kenyon-Wade.

Above the county council, the Senedd Cymru – Welsh Parliament forms the next tier of government.

Knighton falls within the Westminster constituency of Brecon, Radnor and Cwm Tawe.

Knighton belongs to the Senedd constituency of Brecon and Radnorshire, represented by James Evans a Conservative.

====English part====
The few roads and houses that lie across the border in England belong to the civil parish of Stowe, Shropshire. They form part of the Westminster constituency of South Shropshire.

===Public services===
Knighton has a fire station served by a part-time crew and part of the Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service. The local police force is Dyfed-Powys Police, but the town has no police station.

Knighton Hospital in Ffrydd Road occupies the site of the old workhouse and uses some of its former buildings. It has maternity facilities, but no accident and emergency capability. Primary care is provided by a GP practice and a Boots pharmacy.
Social housing is largely provided by two housing associations, one in Wales (Mid Wales Housing Association) and another in England (South Shropshire Housing Association).

===Twinning===
Knighton has been twinned with the small Breton town of Varades since August 2009.

==Demography==



Statistics confirm Knighton&#x27;s slow growth since the early 19th century. The population was estimated in 2019 at 2,912. The 2001 Census provides a snapshot of Knighton today and allows comparisons with the county and Wales as a whole. Knightonians are less likely to describe their identity as Welsh than inhabitants of other parts of Wales. It is also more homogenous and enjoys higher employment rates.

==Culture==
===Attractions===
The town includes visible remains of two early castle mottes, one at Bryn-y-Castell and the other hidden behind the fire station and in a private garden. The Clock Tower was built in 1872 and is similar to those in Rhayader, Hay on Wye and Machynlleth.

On the last Saturday in August the town normally holds an annual Carnival and Show, which attracts visitors from around the world, though it did not take place in 2020 due to COVID-19. Its two parades, one at midday and another around 8 pm, consist of various themed carnival floats with people in fancy dress. The show takes place at the town&#x27;s showground at Bryn-y-Castell, which is also home to Knighton Town F.C., Knighton Cricket Club and Knighton Hockey Club.

Just outside Knighton and visible for many miles is an observatory with a telescope, Europe&#x27;s largest camera obscura, and a planetarium. This is part of the Spaceguard UK project, which searches for asteroids.

Knighton Community Centre is the town&#x27;s largest venue for discos, performances, wrestling, bands, artists, and local clubs and organisations. Knighton includes two National Trails: Glyndŵr&#x27;s Way and Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path. The Offa&#x27;s Dyke Association has a visitors&#x27; centre in the town alongside the site of the ceremony at which John Hunt, Baron Hunt of Llanfair Waterdine inaugurated the long-distance footpath system in 1971. Much of the route is a bridle path as well as a footpath, with even some vehicles allowed to use it. It is a walk recommended by the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;. The Jack Mytton Way passes nearby and another Wat&#x27;s Dyke Way was proposed.

===Cultural references===
Knighton has featured in two major films. &quot;Gone to Earth&quot;, released in 1950 and directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, used the nearby location of Pentre, New Invention. &quot;Second Best&quot;, released in 1994 and starring William Hurt, was filmed partly in Knighton.

The Oscar-winning actor Julie Christie lived nearby in the 1970s. The actor Richard Thorp, famous as the tubby former publican Alan Turner in &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, lived at Skyborry.

Knighton is mentioned in &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; by A. E. Housman:
Bruce Chatwin was inspired to write a novel, &quot;On the Black Hill&quot;, by a hill of that name just north of the town, on the road to Clun. He stayed nearby in Purslow with friends in the 1970s.

On a less literary note, Guy N. Smith&#x27;s book &quot;Knighton Vampires&quot; is based locally.
The musician, songwriter, historian, and broadcaster Alexis Korner also lived nearby in the 1970s.

===Sport===

Knighton has rugby, cricket, football and hockey teams. It has a nine-hole golf course, designed by Harry Vardon in 1906.

Knighton Town F.C. plays in the Mid Wales League and for the Aspidistra Radnorshire Cup. Arthur Rowley, brother of England international Jack Rowley, managed the team.

Knighton has a swimming pool and leisure centre.

In July 2009, Knighton hosted Round 2 of the British Enduro Championship. The Tour of Britain cycle race passed through Knighton in 2014.

==Notable residents==

*Alfred Edwards (1850–1923), businessman, was with Herbert Kilpin one of the charter members of the Italian club A.C. Milan, originally named Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club. He was also elected its first president.
*Kenneth Turpin (1915–2005), a former Provost of Oriel College, Oxford and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, retired to the town.
*Ron Powell (1929–1992), football goalkeeper, played over 500 senior games.

==Economy==
The town&#x27;s shops serve a large rural hinterland and employ 18 per cent of the active population – almost as many as manufacturing, at 18.81 per cent. Otherwise Knighton has little industry. Most young people leave after completing their education. Tourism is a crucial area hit hard by the foot and mouth epidemic of 2001. Although wages are low and over 20 per cent of families have no car, Knighton has an unemployment rate (2001) of just 2.88 per cent.

Responsibility for economic development lies with the Welsh Assembly Government. The town&#x27;s remoteness means it has few commuters. Most of the employed (69.45 per cent in 2001) work within a area.

==Education==

Knighton has a primary school, but for state secondary education pupils travel by bus to John Beddoes School in Presteigne. Until 1974 Knighton had a secondary modern school, on the site of the current primary school. Knighton Church in Wales Primary School (until 1998 Knighton Voluntary Primary School) had 299 pupils in 2008. In its most recent Estyn inspection it was graded &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Satisfactory&quot;, the inspectors being largely positive, but critical of &quot;low expectations&quot;.

==Geography==
===Location===
Knighton is from the UK capital city, London, from the Welsh capital of Cardiff, and from the county town, Llandrindod Wells. For the smaller part of Knighton that lies in Shropshire, the unitary authority administrative centre, and county town of Shrewsbury is away.

The town is remote, but connected with the following towns and villages.

===Geology and geomorphology===

Knighton is at , in a sparsely populated tract of mid-Wales and the English border marked by a hilly plateau cut by narrow river valleys with a broadly east–west axis. To the west, ground rises steeply towards Radnor Forest, and to the north more gently to the summit of Clun Forest. Turning east, the elevation falls gently to the Shropshire Plain. To the south of the town stands Llan Wen hill.

The town centre lies some above sea level, although the surrounding hills – Bailey Hill is the highest – rise to . The only major river is the River Teme.

According to Samuel Lewis (a mid 19th-century visitor):

Knighton rests on Ludlovian rocks of the Silurian Period. It was close to the southern edge of the ice-sheet during the last ice age.

===Climate===
The average temperature and rainfall figures, taken between 1971 and 2000 at the Met Office weather station in Shawbury, can be seen on that page. Though away, Shawbury is the nearest recording station and has a similar climate. Knighton is in the rain shadow of the Cambrian Mountains, making it slightly warmer and notably drier than the average for Wales.

On 18 August 2004, fish fell from the sky in one of the most recent instances of raining animals within the United Kingdom.

==Transport==
Knighton is about midway between Shrewsbury and Hereford, at the junction of the A4113 and the A488 road.

Local bus services are limited and subsidised.

Knighton railway station is on the Heart of Wales Line. Transport for Wales Rail provides direct trains to Shrewsbury and to Swansea via Llandrindod. The station itself is just inside Shropshire, England.

The nearest international airport is at Birmingham. Light aircraft can fly from Welshpool Airport and Shobdon Aerodrome.

<text>New Radnor () is a village and community in Powys, Wales. It is south of Radnor Forest, and was historically the county town of Radnorshire.

In the 2001 census, the community&#x27;s population of 410 was split evenly between male and female, in 192 households. The population at the 2011 census was 409. The community includes the village of Llanfihangel Nant Melan.

== Medieval planned layout ==
The village lies by the Radnor Forest and has been said to have been built to replace Old Radnor. It was a planned medieval walled town with streets laid out in a grid pattern. It was linked to other settlements nearby and regionally such as Builth, Presteigne and Kington Castle and later Huntington Castle near Gladestry.

== The castle ==
Attractions in the village include a significant castle mound of a Norman motte .
New Radnor castle was originally called Trefaesyfed and was once a considerable fortress and a significant border castle in the Welsh Marches and played its part in the turmoil, violence and barbarity of the early medieval period typical of such a site.

The first castle at New Radnor may have been built by William Fitz Osbern earl of Hereford. Certainly he held the land by the time of his death in 1071 and the layout of the powerful castle suggests that it was built by a man of great influence. Soon after 1086 New Radnor was granted to Philip de Braose. It may have been at this time that ten minor castles were built nearby to strengthen the Norman hold on the district.

== Welsh attacks ==
In the aftermath of the battle of Dingestow New Radnor Castle was seized by the sons of Einion Clud of Elfael. Einion o&#x27;r Porth and Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth entertained Baldwin of Exeter, Archbishop of Canterbury and Giraldus Cambrensis here in 1188 during their famous tour of Wales recruiting for The Crusades. Einion was killed by his brother in 1191 and in 1195 Matilda de St Valery was probably responsible for retaking the castle for her husband William de Braose. As a result, the previous overlord Rhys ap Gruffydd returned and sacked the castle before winning the battle of Radnor against Roger Mortimer and Hugh de Say.

Rhys died in 1197 and by 1200 William de Braose was back at Radnor Castle. In 1208 King John took the castle from the rebellious de Braose, only to lose it in 1215 to Giles de Braose, Bishop of Hereford. In August 1216 King John and Gwallter Clud the brother of Einion o&#x27;r Porth burned the castle in revenge.

After the death of the last Braose of Radnor the castle was taken into royal or crown custody but was destroyed by Prince Llywelyn ab Iorwerth in 1231. In 1233 it was illegally rebuilt by Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall and then passed to the young Roger Mortimer of Wigmore Castle. In 1264 Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd allied with Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester took and again destroyed the castle. In all the castle had changed hands twelve times in only eighty years. On four of these occasions the castle was said to have been &#x27;destroyed&#x27;.

== Owain Glyndŵr ==
The castle was said to have been attacked and destroyed by Owain Glyndŵr and his forces during his rebellion of 1400 to 1412. Owain&#x27;s forces allegedly attacked it in either 1401 or 1403, capturing the garrison of sixty men inside, whom he then hanged from the curtain walls over the battlements, then beheaded and buried nearby. Human bones were accidentally disturbed during excavations for church rebuilding in 1843 and as they were excavated it was noted that the skulls were piled separately to the skeletons. They were unceremoniously piled in a mass grave.

It has since been proved that this story of the castle&#x27;s fall and the massacre of the garrison in 1403 is a much later legend that has no basis in fact.

==Later history==
By 1405 King Henry IV of England had regained the castle and garrisoned it with a new force of thirty men-at-arms and one hundred and fifty archers under the command of Richard, Lord Grey. This force was more suitable for the defence of the castle and posed a deterrent to another Welsh attack.

Radnor castle then gently fell into decay in the more peaceful times and by 1538 only one tower remained habitable and that was used as the county prison. The castle was in the care of the Earls of Pembroke in the reign of James I and then passed to Lord Powis.

During the English Civil War the castle was visited by King Charles I in 1642 but after a siege was captured and dismantled by Parliamentary forces to prevent it becoming a Royalist stronghold again, a process known as slighting.

== The medieval castle remains ==
The castle was described as being nearly square with massive square towers at three corners and two smaller round towers covering the now village. There were still walls standing in 1840 but today only the earthworks remain. The rest of the stonework must have been used as a ready supply of cut stone and was depleted by the local people for their homes and farms and some became buried, emerging in digging in the 19th century.
The earthworks consist of a large mound or motte, protected to the north by a double ditch, probably built by the earl of Cornwall in 1233. Beyond this is a large bailey with the foundations of a rectangular building within it.
The village is still surrounded by remains of the town earthwork banks which are especially visible to the south-west. The layout of the then town within the banks might suggest that New Radnor started life as a Roman town or Saxon burgh although there is no evidence for this and it is most likely a planned medieval layout, possibly on the 13th century, when three murage grants were made to the town.

== County town status ==

New Radnor when it was the county town had its own Court. The honour later passed to Presteigne. The old Town Hall on Broad Street has been demolished.

The parliamentary seat of Radnor was sometimes involved in turbulent local politics, as in 1693 when two rival families the Lewis&#x27;s (Whigs) and the Harley&#x27;s (Tories) met on the High Street in New Radnor and drew swords, such was the bad blood between them. One man involved, later Sir Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, becoming MP, three times Speaker of the House of Commons and also Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1710 and later Lord High Treasurer, and very nearly Prime Minister. But he was to be dismissed by the Queen, imprisoned in The Tower in 1715. He died in 1724 and is buried in Brampton Bryan.

While it was historically a town, following its reduction in size and importance, it is now referred to as a village.

== New Radnor monument ==
There is a large monument in the village which is a Grade II* listed structure and stands at approximately 77 ft tall. The monument was built in memory of Sir George Cornewall Lewis (1806–1863) and designed in High Victorian Gothic style by John Gibbs. Sir George was the son of Sir Thomas Frankland Lewis of Harpton Court near New Radnor. The family owned large estates and were powerful men both sides of the border. Sir George became a lawyer and went on to become the MP for Herefordshire. He also served as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary and Secretary of State for War. In the last decade the monument has fallen into a state of disrepair and has had to be sealed off from the general public. But in September 2001 the local authorities agreed to pay out on renovation work for the monument.
As of February 2009, the monument is again fenced off and awaiting repair, and has been for more than two years. There seems to be some doubt as to which body is responsible for its upkeep. As of January 2012, the monument has undergone repair and is accessible again.

== Rural area and tourism ==
New Radnor&#x27;s main sources of income and jobs and employment opportunities are still from farming and agriculture and today there are new smaller businesses such as cider making, picture framing and holiday homes, bed &amp; breakfast establishments and tourism in general.
There is also a huge quarry nearby which employs local people. The stone locally is known for being extremely 
hard.

==Railway history==
With ambitions for an east–west railway line to Aberystwyth, the Kington and Eardisley Railway extended the Leominster and Kington Railway from Kington, Herefordshire, England. Other than the small station from the town, the plans never came to fruition, only allowing services on the Great Western Railway to both Leominster and onwards to London Paddington. The station closed to passengers in February 1951, and for freight in December 1951.

==Sport==
The village has a football club called Radnor Valley Football Club.

Harpton Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1909. The club and course closed in 1934.

== Amenities ==
There is a chapel, a church, a village hall, a war memorial and a primary school teaching approx 80 pupils. The village Post Office closed in 2008.

<text>Macclesfield was, from 1974 to 2009, a local government district with borough status in Cheshire, England. It included the towns of Bollington, Knutsford, Macclesfield and Wilmslow and within its wider area the villages and hamlets of Adlington, Disley, Gawsworth, Kerridge, Pott Shrigley, Poynton, Prestbury, Rainow, Styal, Sutton and Tytherington.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It was a merger of Macclesfield municipal borough, Alderley Edge, Bollington, Knutsford and Wilmslow urban districts, along with the single parish Disley Rural District, Macclesfield Rural District and part of Bucklow Rural District. The new district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chairman of the council to take the title of mayor.

In 2006 the Department for Communities and Local Government considered reorganising Cheshire&#x27;s administrative structure as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. The decision to merge the boroughs of Macclesfield, Congleton and Crewe and Nantwich to create a single unitary authority was announced on 25 July 2007, following a consultation period in which a proposal to create a single Cheshire unitary authority was rejected.

The Borough of Macclesfield was abolished on 1 April 2009, when the new Cheshire East unitary authority was formed.

==Civil parishes==
The borough contained 52 civil parishes and 2 discrete unparished areas (namely, the towns of Macclesfield and Wilmslow). Of the 52 civil parishes, five (Agden, Little Bollington, Macclesfield Forest and Wildboarclough, Tatton, and Wincle) held parish meetings rather than elect a parish council. Of the remaining 47 civil parishes, two contained towns (Bollington and Knutsford) and so had town councils rather than parish councils administering them. A number of adjacent or abutting civil parishes were grouped together under a single parish council: Ollerton with Marthall, Plumley with Toft and Bexton, and Tabley (for the parishes of Tabley Inferior and Tabley Superior) The remaining 37 civil parishes had their own parish council.

The following civil parishes were included in the borough:

* Adlington
* Agden
* Alderley Edge
* Ashley
* Aston by Budworth

<text>Presteigne (; : the church of St. Andrew) is a town and community on the south bank of the River Lugg in Powys, Wales. The town is located on the England–Wales border, which surrounds it to the north, east and south. Nearby towns are Kington, Herefordshire to the south and Knighton to the north, and surrounding villages include Norton (within the community) and Stapleton. The community has a population of 2,710; the built-up area had a population of 2,056.

Presteigne was formerly the county town of the historic county of Radnorshire. Despite being in Wales, it is part of the diocese of Hereford in the Church of England.

== History ==

 The town probably began as a small settlement around a Minster church dedicated to St Andrew and at the time of the Domesday Book it formed part of the manor of Humet.

By the mid-12th century, it was known as &#x27;Presthemede&#x27; or &#x27;the bordering meadow of the priests&#x27;. A century later, it passed into the control of the Mortimers, powerful Marcher lords, and on their fall passed into the hands of the Crown.

At the end of the 13th century, the majority of the town&#x27;s inhabitants, mainly English, enjoyed some prosperity but the Black Death and the Glyndŵr rebellion had destroyed this and by the end of the 15th century, the now largely Welsh, population lived in a struggling village. A significant victory in their rebellion was won by the forces of Owain Glyndŵr nearby at the Battle of Bryn Glas in 1402.

The development of a thriving cloth industry in the Tudor period brought short-lived prosperity, ended by three new epidemics of plague in three successive generations. Thereafter it became a market town and, until the later 16th century, a centre for processing locally grown barley into malt.

By the Acts of Union, Presteigne - at first jointly with New Radnor - became the county town of Radnorshire and its administrative and judicial centre, housing the county gaol and the Shire Hall.

By the end of the 19th century its newer and larger neighbour, Llandrindod Wells, had usurped the role of administrative centre, but Presteigne remained the venue for the Assizes until these were abolished in 1971.

After a period of stagnation in the first half of the 20th century, the town has developed a diverse manufacturing base and has begun to exploit its tourism potential while its environment and the development of its social, cultural and leisure facilities have helped to attract people to settle.

Presteigne attracted national attention in 2004 for an unsuccessful campaign by its Mayor, Councillor Peggy Fraser-Scott, to enforce a curfew on the town&#x27;s youth.

===John Beddoes===
Henry Edward&#x27;s &quot;Old English Customs: Curious Requests and Charities&quot; mentions the bell ringer appointed by John Beddoes in 1565 to ring a &quot;day bell&quot; at 8am, and a curfew at 8pm. Beddoes specified that in the event of the custom being abandoned for more than a year, (except in plagues) the funds set aside for this position would revert to his heirs.

Beddoes, a wool merchant, gave his name to Presteigne&#x27;s secondary schoolJohn Beddoes Schoolwhich he established in 1565 and endowed with land.

===Second World War===
During the 1930s, the Ministry of Labour opened a work camp for long-term unemployed young men. Many of the inmates came from the crisis-hit coal mining, steel and heavy industry communities of South Wales. Presteigne was one of a number of Instructional Centres created by the Ministry, and it also had a satellite camp in Shobdon, Herefordshire. By 1938, the Ministry had 38 Instructional Centres across Britain. The camp was situated in Slough Lane near Hill Farm and is now a small private housing site. Land owned by Capt Lewis RN, of Clatterbrune House, was used to hold first Italian and then German POW&#x27;s during the Second World War and is now the home of Presteigne St. Andrews Football Club.

==Art and culture==
The town has become a local cultural centre. It hosts two indigenous festivals. First, the Sheep Music Festival dedicated to contemporary music; and the Presteigne Festival of Music and the Arts which casts a broader cultural net. It attracts composers of the calibre of Ian Wilson.
The town has an award-winning museum - The Judge&#x27;s Lodging - created from the disused Shire Hall and re-opened by Robert Hardy in 1997. The Church of St Andrew permanently houses a 16th-century Flemish Tapestry. Presteigne was also host to the world&#x27;s first competitive electric bicycle race.

==Media==
Since the town is closest to the Wales and England border, local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central that broadcast from Birmingham. Television signals are received from the Ridge Hill TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter. However, BBC Cymru Wales and ITV Cymru Wales can also be received through satellite television such as Freesat and Sky. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, Heart North and Mid Wales and Sunshine Radio.The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;County Times&quot; and &quot;Brecon &amp; Radnor Express&quot;

== Public transport ==
The Kington &amp; Presteigne Railway opened as an extension of the Leominster and Kington Railway on 9 September 1875. The railway line commenced at Titley Junction, passed through Leen farm, to Staunton-on-Arrow, in front of the Rodd farm via Corton into Presteigne. By 1929 it was possible to join one of the three steam trains a day - each way - and make the six hour journey to London. The passenger service on this line ended in 1951, but a freight service continued to run every other day until the line was finally closed for good in 1961. Presteign railway station was within the Great Western Railway.

<text>Florida&#x27;s First Coast, or simply the First Coast, is the Atlantic coast of North Florida in the United States. It is the same general area as the directional region of Northeast Florida. It consists roughly of the counties abutting Jacksonville: Duval, Baker, Clay, Nassau, and St. Johnsand nearby Flagler County and Putnam County. The &quot;First Coast&quot; name originated in a marketing campaign in the 1980s, and has become part of Florida&#x27;s regional vernacular. It is so named due to its history as the first European settlement in what is now the mainland United States, at Fort Caroline, Florida, in 1564.

==History==
As its name suggests, the First Coast was the first area of Florida colonized by Europeans, at Fort Caroline, Florida, in 1564. However, as with several other of Florida&#x27;s vernacular regions, the &quot;First Coast&quot; identity originated in the tourism industry of the 20th Century before it was adopted within the community at large. In 1983 the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce commissioned the William Cook Advertising Agency to develop a new nickname and comprehensive marketing campaign for the entire metropolitan area – Duval, Baker, Clay, Nassau, and St. Johns counties. Jacksonville already had other nicknames, but local officials wanted a new identity to better promote the entire region without overshadowing the identities of the individual localities. The term &quot;Florida&#x27;s First Coast&quot; was coined by William Cook staff members Kay Johnson, Bryan Cox, and Bill Jones, and was officially introduced in the &quot;First Coast Anthem&quot; at the 1983 Gator Bowl.

The First Coast is similar to Florida&#x27;s various other &quot;Coast&quot; regions such as the Space Coast and the Gold Coast that emerged as a result of marketing campaigns. The name refers both to the area&#x27;s geographic status as the &quot;first coast&quot; that many visitors reach when entering Florida, as well as to the region&#x27;s history as the first place in the continental United States to see European contact and settlement. Juan Ponce de León may have landed in this region during his first expedition in 1513, and the early French colony of Fort Caroline was founded in present-day Jacksonville in 1564. Significantly, the First Coast includes St. Augustine, the oldest continuously inhabited European-established city in the continental U.S., founded by the Spanish in 1565.

A 2007 survey by geographers Ary J. Lamme and Raymond K. Oldakowski notes that the term &quot;First Coast&quot; has superseded two earlier geographical appellations for the region: &quot;Florida&#x27;s Crown&quot; and &quot;South Georgia&quot;, attested in earlier surveys. The former term refers to the area&#x27;s northern location and the shape of the Georgia border, while the latter emphasizes that the local culture was considered more similar to that of Georgia and the South in general than to the lower Florida peninsula. A conscious push to supplant potentially uncomplimentary connotations may have led to the decline of &quot;South Georgia&quot; in favor of &quot;First Coast&quot;; this coincides with a waning of terms such as &quot;Old South&quot; and &quot;Dixie&quot; in much of the state. The name &quot;First Coast&quot; reinforces the region&#x27;s connection to the rest of Florida, an important perceptual tie-in for attracting residents, businesses, and tourists.

The term &quot;First Coast&quot; became very popular through the 1980s, surprising even its creators. In 1990, Duval County opened its first new high schools in nearly 20 years, and at one of them, the students chose to name their school First Coast High School. By 2002, nearly 800 organizations and businesses included &quot;First Coast&quot; in their name, to the point that Jacksonville&#x27;s NBC and ABC affiliates, WTLV and WJXX (both jointly owned and operated by Tegna), have branded their local news operation as &quot;First Coast News&quot; since the early 2000s. Lamme and Oldakowski found that in 2007, 18% of Floridians surveyed were familiar with the First Coast, making it one of the best-known vernacular regions by Floridians. The First Coast identity has spread to other nearby areas, being found as far south as Flagler Beach in Flagler County, Florida and Palatka in Putnam County, Florida, and as far north as St. Mary&#x27;s, Georgia. In 2013, the &quot;Florida Times-Union&quot; noted that within the area, St. Johns County had begun to brand itself as the &quot;Historic Coast&quot;.

==Northeast Florida==
The &quot;directional&quot; region of Northeast Florida refers to largely the same area as the First Coast. Lamme and Oldakowski&#x27;s 2007 survey noted that &quot;North East Florida&quot; had emerged as one of six common directional regions, along with North Florida, Central Florida, South Florida, North Central Florida, and South West Florida. The survey found that the term was primarily used in the north-easternmost parts of the state – Nassau and Duval Counties.

Enterprise Florida, the state&#x27;s economic development agency, identifies &quot;Northeast Florida&quot; as one of eight economic regions used by the agency and other state and outside entities. This definition includes all five counties of the Jacksonville metropolitan area (Duval, Baker, Clay, Nassau and St. Johns), as well as Putnam and Flagler counties to the south. Other organizations such as the Florida Department of Transportation, JaxUSA Partnership (the regional business development wing of the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce), and the Northeast Florida Regional Council also use this definition. Similarly, in June 2013, the state established the Northeast Florida Regional Transportation Commission, which covers all these counties besides Flagler.

<doc id="621938" wikidata="Q1681386" url="?curid=621938" title="Rhayader">
<text>Rhayader (; ; ) is a market town and community in Powys, Wales, within the historic county of Radnorshire. The town is from the source of the River Wye on Plynlimon, the highest point of the Cambrian Mountains, and is located at the junction of the A470 road and the A44 road north of Builth Wells and east of Aberystwyth.

The population was 2,088, with 55% of the community having some form of Welsh identity, according to the 2011 census. The community is the largest in Wales by area, with . It includes the Elan Valley.

Rhayader holds the record for the lowest-ever temperature recorded in Wales, -23.3 °C on 21 January 1940.

Jasper Fforde’s novels “Red Side Story” and “Shades of Grey: The Road to High Saffron” are located in a dystopian version of Rhayader called East Carmine.

== Etymology ==
The name, &quot;Rhayader&quot;, is a partly-Anglicised form of its Welsh name, (&#x27;the waterfall&#x27;), or, to distinguish it from other places named after waterfalls, (&#x27;waterfall [on the] Wye&#x27;). Strictly speaking, according to place-name spelling conventions in Welsh, the name of the town would be , and the waterfall itself , but it seems that this distinction is usually ignored.

In the Welsh of the area the name is , as one would expect on the pattern of similar words in colloquial Welsh, . That is, a final &quot;r&quot; is dropped after &quot;d&quot;, as in (&#x27;plough&#x27;) &gt; , (&#x27;church of Cynidr&#x27;, a village in Breconshire) &gt; , (a forename, &#x27;battle-leader&#x27;) &gt; , .

Little remains of the waterfall itself, it having been destroyed in 1780 to make way for the bridge linking the town to and the Elan Valley, the Lakeland of Wales.

== History ==

Rhayader has long been a natural stopping point for travellers – the Romans had a stop-over camp in the Elan Valley, monks travelled between the abbeys of Strata Florida and Abbeycwmhir and drovers headed to the lucrative markets with their livestock. It was not until the 12th century that a documented history of the town began with the building of Rhayader Castle in 1177. Little remains today, with the exception of a dry moat that can be seen from Wauncapel Park.

One of the oldest buildings in Rhayader is the Old Swan, which stands on the corner of West and South Streets Rhayader. The original building was mentioned in 1676 as being one of the two inns in Rhayader at that date. Some changes were made in 1683, including the rebuilding of the three chimney stacks, and this date is carved into the old timbers inside the building.

In the 19th century, turnpike roads were only passable on payment of extortionate tolls, imposing additional burdens on already poor communities. This led to the Rebecca Riots across South and Mid Wales from 1839 to 1842, with no fewer than six of Rhayader&#x27;s tollgates being demolished with impunity by local farmers dressed as women. The actions of these &quot;Rebeccaites&quot; led to a Commission of Inquiry being set up, and most of Rebecca&#x27;s grievances were righted two years later.

In the 1890s the rapidly expanding city of Birmingham, east, viewed the nearby Elan Valley as the ideal source of clean, safe water. This was to change the face of Rhayader forever, bringing thousands of workers involved in building this massive complex of dams and reservoirs to the area. A new railway was built connecting this huge area with the main network in Rhayader, and the construction of a new village to house the workers was built on the banks of the River Elan. Work started in 1894 and the scheme was officially opened in 1904 by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.

The area around the town has several cairns and standing stones dating from several thousand years BCE. An important hoard of gold jewellery dating from the 1st–2nd centuries AD was found nearby in 1899. Known as the Rhayader Hoard, it is now in the Romano-British collection of the British Museum.

==Governance==
Rhayader is an electoral ward to Powys County Council, electing one county councillor. the incumbent is Cllr Angela Davies of the Liberal Democrats.

Rhayader Town Council represents the town at the local level, with 14 town councillors elected from the Rhayader and community wards.

== Notable people ==
* Jonathan Williams (ca.1752 – 1829), clergyman, schoolmaster and antiquarian writer.
* Thomas Jones (1819–1882), Independent minister, known as the &quot;Welsh Poet-Preacher&quot;
* John Evans (1867–1958), emigrated to Canada in 1890 and became a farmer and politician
* Mary Jones (1896–1990), film actress.
*Robert Jermain Thomas (1840disappeared 1866), Protestant missionary who served with the London Missionary Society in China and Korea

== Transport ==
The station on the Mid-Wales Railway line that served the town was closed on 31 December 1962. The nearest station is now away, at Pen-y-Bont railway station, Crossgates on the Heart of Wales line, though connections are usually made at the more accessible Llandrindod railway station, a similar distance away.

A bus service connects with outlying villages and neighbouring towns, with two-hourly daytime departures to Builth Wells, Llandrindod Wells, Aberystwyth and Newtown, with connections to Hereford, Shrewsbury and Cardiff.

Due to the volume of traffic generated by the convergence of two trunk roads — the A44 and the A470 — the construction of a bypass to relieve congestion at the town centre crossroads has been an ongoing debate for many years.

The town is also a popular cycling centre and is on Route 8 of the United Kingdom National Cycle Network, known in Welsh as , &#x27;Wales&#x27; green lane&#x27;.

== Amenities ==
Tourism and agriculture are the most important industries locally. Walkers and cyclists are drawn to Rhayader for the abundance of trails and bridleways surrounding the town, which is the gateway to a massive complex of reservoirs and dams (The Elan Valley). This vast area is home to some of Britain&#x27;s rarest wildlife and plants, including red kites, along with magnificent feats of engineering.

There are a number of hotels, bed and breakfasts and campsites to accommodate the large number of visitors that travel to the area all year round.

Rhayader is also home to a community founded art and heritage complex which includes a museum and gallery, a leisure centre, numerous parks and all the amenities expected of a larger town. Potter Phil Rogers has his studio in Rhayader. There are an abundance of shops, cash facilities, restaurants, takeaways and supermarkets catering to both the local population and visitors to the area.

Rhayader is also renowned for being the town with the highest concentration of pubs and drinking establishments, per capita, in the UK, with one to each 173 people.

In nearby Nant-glas, across the river Wye from the village of Llanwrthwl, the Living Willow Theatre, an open-air theatre constructed of living willow trees, was opened in 2007.

== Sport ==
Rhayader Town F.C., despite previously having some success in the League of Wales - the top-tier of domestic Welsh football between 1997 and 2002, ceased to exist in the summer of 2006. The club has since reformed, and in its inaugural season gained promotion into the Spar Mid Wales League. A subsequent promotion to the Cymru Alliance followed, but a finishing position of 15th saw the team relegated after just one season. The town&#x27;s rugby union team play in the Cambrian Training Mid Wales League. There is also a cricket club and thriving local darts, dominos and pool leagues.

The town is also well known by motocross fans. Every summer a series of events take place at the nearby Cwmythig Hill circuit, with many of Britain&#x27;s top riders taking part. The race series regularly attracts over 5,000 spectators.

As part of the annual carnival celebrations, Rhayader also plays host to a number of World Championship events in lesser celebrated sports, including wheelbarrow racing and rock-paper-scissors.

== Development ==

Rhayader and its surrounding districts are supported by development organisation Rhayader 2000 Ltd, established in 1996 to revive Rhayader&#x27;s economy. Rhayader 2000 Ltd is a voluntary sector organisation representing a cross section of the local community. It builds links with Powys County Council, Rhayader Town Council, local businesses and charitable and voluntary organisations.

<text>&quot;I Wanna Be a Cowboy&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; is a country and western song written in 1934 and first recorded in 1935 by Rubye Blevins, who performed as Patsy Montana. It was the first country song by a female artist to sell more than one million copies.

== Background and release ==

Montana wrote the song in 1934 when she was feeling lonely and missing her boyfriend; it was recorded a year later when producer Art Satherley, of ARC Records, needed one more song at a Prairie Ramblers recording session. Montana was the group&#x27;s soloist at the time. Her song is based on Stuart Hamblen&#x27;s western song &quot;Texas Plains&quot;: he is therefore credited as a cowriter. Patsy Montana embellished the simpler musical pattern of the original, especially with her yodeling. Patsy also used a lot of the original words: the song is somewhat of a feminine answer to its precursor.

== Reception ==
Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. In 2012 her record was added to the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry list of &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically important&quot; American sound recordings.

==Cover versions==
&quot;I Want to Be a Cowboy&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; has been recorded by, among others,
* Rosalie Allen, in a 1940s yodeling version, 
* Patti Page (as a single) 
* Suzy Bogguss (on her 1989 album &quot;Somewhere Between&quot;). Her version peaked at #77 on the Hot Country Songs chart.
* Dixie Chicks (on their 1990 debut album &quot;Thank Heavens for Dale Evans&quot;) 
* Lynn Anderson (on her 1992 album &quot;Cowboy&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot;) 
* Nickel Creek on their 1993 album &quot;Little Cowpoke&quot;
* LeAnn Rimes (on her 1994 album &quot;All That&quot;) 
* Clelia Adams on her 2004 album &quot;Heartbeat Highway&quot;
* Leslie Avril on her 1994 album &quot;Champagne and Desolation&quot;
* Bev McShanag and Olive Bice on their 1985 cassette &quot;Yodelling in Harmony&quot;

* Ha*Ash (American band) made a Spanish yodeling version of the song called &quot;Vaquera&quot; on her 2005 album &quot;Mundos Opuestos&quot;.
* Phish (performed in 1996 and released in 2007 on &quot;Vegas 96&quot;)
* Cyndi Lauper featuring yodeling Jewel (on her 2016 album &quot;Detour&quot;).

<doc id="621943" wikidata="Q1003123" url="?curid=621943" title="Builth Wells">
<text>Builth Wells (; ) is a market town and community in the county of Powys and historic county of Brecknockshire (Breconshire), mid Wales, lying at the confluence of rivers Wye and Irfon, in the Welsh (or upper) part of the Wye Valley. In 2011 it had a population of 2,568.

==Etymology==

&quot;Builth&quot; is a longstanding anglicisation of the Old Welsh or , which combines () &#x27;ox&#x27; and (later ) &#x27;lea or leas&#x27;.

The town added &quot;Wells&quot; in the 19th century when its springs were promoted as a visitor attraction. Its modern Welsh name means &#x27;Saint Mary in Ox Leas&#x27;.

In the centre of the town is a large mural (about by wide) depicting , who was killed at the Battle of Orewin Bridge on 11 December 1282.
==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Builth Wells, at community (town) and county level: Builth Wells Town Council and Powys County Council. The town council is based at Strand Hall on Strand Street, which also serves as a community hall and events venue.

For elections to Powys County Council the community boundaries are coterminous with the Builth electoral ward, which sends one county councillor to sit on the council. Since 1995 the ward had been represented by Independent councillors. At the May 2017 elections the seat was won by former international rugby player, Jeremy Pugh.

Builth Wells is in the Brecon, Radnor and Cwm Tawe constituency for elections to the UK parliament and Brecon and Radnorshire for elections to the Senedd.

===Administrative history===
The ancient parish covering the town was called Builth, which formed part of the Builth hundred of Brecknockshire. In 1866 a local government district was created covering the more built-up part of the parish, governed by an elected local board.

Such local government districts were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. The urban district was extended at the same time to cover the whole parish of Builth. In 1898, Breconshire County Council changed the urban district&#x27;s name from Builth to Builth Wells, at the urban district council&#x27;s request.

Builth Wells Urban District was abolished in 1974, with its area instead becoming a community called Builth Wells within the Borough of Brecknock in the new county of Powys. The former urban district council&#x27;s functions therefore passed to Brecknock Borough Council, which was in turn abolished in 1996 and its functions passed to Powys County Council.

==Livestock breeds==

The White Bull of Builth may be a reference to a herd of White Park Cattle that lived in the area from Post-Roman times. Two herds survived in Wales to modern times. The laws of the time suggest that the medieval and later economy of the Welsh borders was strongly dependent on cattle. The Hereford cattle breed, named after Hereford market where it was most prominently sold was the main breed of the Welsh borders. Builth was the market for a variant of the Hereford called the Builth Smokey Face. This was the traditional animal of the area but the breed has not existed for many, many decades.

The Beulah Speckled Face is a local breed of sheep. Nearby Mynydd Epynt was famous for its horses until it was seized for military training purposes.

The beef cattle market has vanished and economically sheep are now vastly more important than cattle with consequences for the traditional woodlands of the area, the salmon runs and other important ecological features.

==Industry==
Llanelwedd Quarry was the source of the stone used in many of Builth&#x27;s buildings, and in the dams along the Elan Valley. The quarry was the source of the first laumontite mined in Wales. It is operated by Hanson Aggregates.

==Transport==
The town is served by Builth Road railway station on the Heart of Wales Line, which is located just over 2 miles to the north-west. The more central (Builth Wells) railway station on the Mid-Wales Railway was opened in 1864, and closed with the line in 1962 – actually before the Beeching Axe. It was located across the river, next to the present showground.

A dedicated cycle route linking the town with Swansea (NCR 43) has been proposed and a 13-mile section of the route from Swansea has already been developed.

One of the main Wales north-south trunk roads, the A483, passes through the town, using the former railway route. As of June 2009 part of this road, along with the other main route through town (A470), is the subject of a transport study by the Welsh Assembly to help alleviate traffic congestion in the town centre.

The bridge at Builth Wells carries vehicles on the A470. It dates from the 18th-century and has six masonry spans, with small cutwaters on the upstream side. The centre of the bridge has two pedestrian refuges. It was built in 1775 and widened in 1925. The river here marks the boundary between the old counties of Breconshire and Radnorshire.

==Education and recreation==
Ysgol Calon Cymru is the main secondary school and is bilingual. It replaced Builth Wells High School in September 2018 and can draw on certain specialist teachers and facilities as is dual campus with its other site in Llandrindod Wells. In 2000 its predecessor was placed 67th in Wales (by percentage of its children, 59%, gaining 5 GCSEs at full pass grades A*–C). According to a 2010 report by Estyn its rate rose to 77%, making it 9th best performing (state secondary) in Wales and the only ranking in Powys after Llanidloes High School. A fall to two years of Special Measures was followed in 2017 by the closing report of the old school finding sufficient progress to remove it from those measures. Progress was ranked as strong as to six recommendations of 2015, in 2017, and sufficient progress as to the other.

The town features Wyeside Arts Centre, which has two cinemas and a live performance stage.

Builth Wells has a rugby union team called Builth Wells RFC, also known as &#x27;The Bulls&#x27;, who play on the Groe. The team play in the WRU SWALEC National League 2.

The town&#x27;s football team is Builth Wells F.C. who play in the Ardal Leagues, the third tier of Welsh football.

Builth Male Voice Choir has approximately fifty members and performs concerts to support local and national charities.

Builth Wells also has a cricket pitch, tennis courts, a sports centre with squash courts, a 25m swimming pool and a bowling green.

==Buildings and landmarks==
Builth Wells has a large number of Grade II listed buildings and fixtures.

A plaque on the wall of the post office stakes its claim as the only in England and Wales to bear a contemporary inscription to less-than-one-year monarch Edward VIII. The claim can be qualified to active post offices as the former one in Bradford-on-Avon has a similar insignia.

After a small health centre opened in the town, Builth Wells Hospital closed in 2013.

<text>Titian Ramsay Peale (November 17, 1799 – March 13, 1885) was an American artist, naturalist, and explorer from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was a scientific illustrator whose paintings and drawings of wildlife are known for their beauty and accuracy.

Peale was a member of several high-profile scientific expeditions. In 1819–20, he and Thomas Say accompanied Stephen Harriman Long on an expedition to the Rocky Mountains. He was also a member of the United States Exploring Expedition (1838–1842).

Starting around 1855, Peale became an enthusiastic amateur photographer. Many of his photographs featured buildings and landscapes in and around Washington D.C. He joined a local club with other amateur photographers and participated in field trips, photo exchanges and contests. By the end of the Civil War, his interest in photography waned and he only occasionally took pictures.

== Biography ==

=== Family and early life ===
Peale was born on November 17, 1799 in Philosophical Hall, Philadelphia, which housed his father&#x27;s Philadelphia Museum. The youngest son of the polymath Charles Willson Peale and his wife Elizabeth de Peyster, Peale was named after his dead half-brother, also named Titian Ramsay Peale (1780–1798). The family moved to Germantown, Pennsylvania, outside of Philadelphia, where Peale began collecting and drawing butterflies and other insects. Some of his drawings were published in Thomas Say&#x27;s &quot;American Entomology&quot; as early as 1816, but most remained unpublished until recently. Like his older brothers Raphaelle, Rembrandt, and Rubens Peale, Titian helped his father in the preservation of the museum&#x27;s specimens for display.

=== Scientific career and expeditions ===

Peale was a member of the &quot;first private, museum sponsored exploration in the United States&quot;, when he joined William Maclure, Thomas Say, and George Ord on an expedition to Florida and Georgia in 1817, sponsored by the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.

In 1819–20, he and Say joined a government-led expedition to the Rocky Mountains led by Stephen Harriman Long, during which Peale made a large collection of drawings of natural objects and scenery.

In the winter of 1824–25, Peale traveled to South Carolina and Florida to collect bird specimens for Charles Lucien Bonaparte&#x27;s forthcoming quasi-continuation of Alexander Wilson&#x27;s &quot;American Ornithology&quot; (1825–1833). In Florida, he boarded for a short time at the farm of Bonaparte&#x27;s cousin, Achille Murat, and returned to Philadelphia in April 1825.

In 1831–32, Peale explored the Magdalena River valley in northern Colombia. According to a notice published by Constantine S. Rafinesque in 1832: &quot;Mr. Peale is just returned from his voyage to South America, and travels in 1831 up the R. Magdalena to Bogota. He has brought a fine zoological collection for the Philadelphia Museum, among which are 500 birds and 50 quadrupeds, which were not there. It is expected that he will publish an account of his zoological travels and discoveries. He asserts the very singular fact that the R. Magdalena has no shells and but few fishes.&quot;

Around 1832 Peale was one of the first naturalists to question the veracity of John James Audubon&#x27;s claim of discovering a new species of eagle.
In 1833, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. From 1833 to 1836, Peale managed the Philadelphia Museum, which had been founded by his father Charles Willson Peale.
In 1838, Peale boarded the USS &quot;Peacock&quot; and served as chief naturalist for the United States Exploring Expedition (1838–1842) led by Lt. Charles Wilkes. The other naturalists on the expedition were James Dwight Dana and Charles Pickering. As chief naturalist, he collected and preserved various specimens of natural history, many of which he packed and shipped back to Philadelphia. During the expedition, Wilkes named Peale Passage after Titian Peale.

In 1848, he was removed from the payroll of the scientific corps. In 1851, a fire at the Library of Congress destroyed nearly all of the 100 copies of Peale&#x27;s expedition report, &quot;Mammalia and Ornithology&quot; (1848), and its publication was delayed. John Cassin was hired to produce a corrected volume, which was published in 1858.

=== Scientific collections ===
Peale was the second ornithologist known to collect a female golden-winged Warbler (&quot;Vermivora chrysoptera&quot;), and the first to illustrate it. Thomas Jefferson collected one in 1782. Peale shot his specimen in 1824 near Camden, New Jersey, and his drawing was engraved by Alexander Lawson and published in Plate 1 of Bonaparte’s &quot;American Ornithology; or, the Natural History of Birds Inhabiting the United States, Not Given by Wilson&quot;, vol. 1 (Philadelphia: Carey, Lea &amp; Carey, 1825).

Peale developed an effective method for storing butterflies in sealed cases with glass fronts and backs, and parts of his collection of over 100 species still survive.

He was the curator for the Peale&#x27;s Museum and was a notable scientific illustrator of Central Plains flora and fauna for several decades. He also designed coins for the United States Mint.

=== Later years and death ===
Peale was employed at the United States Patent Office until 1873. He died on March 13, 1885, in Philadelphia and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery, Section 8, Lot 74, in an unmarked grave.

<text>Ghibli Experimental Theater On Your Mark (Japanese: ジブリ実験劇場 On Your Mark, Hepburn: &quot;Jiburi Jikkengekijō On Yua Māku&quot;) is an animated music video created by Studio Ghibli for the song &quot;On Your Mark&quot; (also released in English as &quot;Castles in the Air&quot;) by the Japanese rock duo Chage and Aska . The song was released in 1994 as part of the single &quot;Heart&quot;. In 1995, Hayao Miyazaki wrote and directed the short film for the song as a side-project after having writer&#x27;s block with &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;. The anime music video is non-linear, providing multiple reiterations and alternate scenes to depict the events. The music video added sound effects to the audio track, but contains no dialogue. Miyazaki purposely misinterpreted the lyrics to present his vision of a world where the surface becomes inhospitable and humans live in an underground city. He made the video cryptic to evoke creative interpretations among viewers.

The music video follows two policemen who raid and massacre a religious cult and find an angelic being, only to have her taken away and confined to a secure laboratory. Haunted by the fate of the angel, the two men formulate a plan and break into the laboratory. Fleeing in an armored truck, the three plummet into an abyss after trying to force past a police aircraft along a narrow, suspended roadway. After a montage of the previous scenes, the armored truck suddenly rockets into an apartment complex, allowing their escape. The three escape to the surface, ignoring the radiation and danger signs, emerging near an encased nuclear reactor. The two men set the angel free and she flies off into the sky.

The music video was well-received and praised for its animation and attention to detail. It premiered as a short before Studio Ghibli&#x27;s &quot;Whisper of the Heart&quot; and has since been released on Laserdisc and DVD as part of the &quot;All Things Ghibli Special Short Short&quot; (&quot;Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short Short&quot;) compilation.

==Synopsis==
The video begins with shots of a vacant village, overgrown with weeds, and the concrete sarcophagus of a covered-over nuclear reactor in the background. As the music begins, the scene changes to a sci-fi-style nighttime military-style police raid on a cult. Futuristic flying troop transports crash through the windows of a tower topped by gigantic neon-lit eyes and occupied by armed defenders. The policemen exchange gunfire and grenades with cultists whose hoods depict an enormous eye. As the victorious police begin to sort through the bodies of the cultists, two policemen find what appears to be a girl, lying unconscious, with large feathered wings on her back.

The scene changes again, now to bright daylight and blue sky. Two men are driving an old Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider passo corto down an empty road. As one of the men helps the girl up, she spreads her wings and he holds her hands while she gains confidence. With a nudge she is airborne, but she seems hesitant and afraid as he lets go.

The scene changes back to the discovery of the girl in the tower, and the identity of the two policemen is revealed to be the same from the previous sequence. They carefully carry her out and offer her something to drink. A team of scientists wearing radiation suits arrive and quickly take the girl away.

The two men are haunted by the girl&#x27;s fate and formulate a plan to rescue her. They break into the laboratory and free her from confinement, but the lab&#x27;s alarms are triggered. The three escape in an armored truck and drive along a narrow suspended roadway over a domed city built in a crater. Police hovercraft are in pursuit, and one of them comes very low to the roadway to block the fugitives&#x27; truck. The roadway collapses when the protagonists try to force their way through, sending the truck plummeting. The winged girl refuses to let go of the hands of her rescuers, and the three fall into the abyss.

A brief montage of previous shots follows: the discovery of the girl, the girl flying through a blue sky, the two men rescuing the girl from the laboratory and stealing the truck, the truck plummeting amidst the wreckage of the roadway. But this time, the truck fires stabilizing thrusters and makes a short flight into the side of an apartment building. After their escape, the three are riding an old Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider passo corto through a dark tunnel underneath signs which bear radiation symbols and read (in kanji) &quot;Beware Of Sunlight&quot; and &quot;Survival Not Guaranteed&quot;. As they emerge into daylight, they drive past nuclear cooling towers and a sign which reads &quot;Extreme Danger&quot; and continue down the road.

One of the men helps the girl up, she spreads her wings and gives them a grateful smile; he kisses her hand, and the other winks in farewell. Soon, she is drifting upward into the sky. Briefly, a major urban cityscape is seen beyond the trees. The car veers off the road and slows to a stop in the grass.

==Production==
The production of the music video began because Miyazaki was suffering from writer&#x27;s block on &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; and needed another project to distract him. Miyazaki wrote and directed the music video for &quot;On Your Mark&quot;, although the song was previously released in 1994 as part of the single &quot;Heart&quot;. Despite the popularity of the work, Toshio Suzuki told Helen McCarthy, the British author of numerous anime reference books, that Studio Ghibli had not given &quot;100 percent&quot; focus to the music video.

In the production of the music video, Miyazaki experimented with using computer animation to supplement traditional hand drawn cel-animation. At the time Studio Ghibli did not have its own computer department and the work was outsourced to CG Production Company Links, under supervision of Hideki Nakano, Silicon Graphics, Softimage 3D, and Alias Research. Techniques learned in the experimentation for &quot;On Your Mark&quot; were later adopted for the creation of &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;. Animation director was Masashi Andō. Long time Miyazaki collaborator Michiyo Yasuda was in charge of colour selection. Backgrounds were created by Kazuo Oga. Yōji Takeshige made his debut as art director. There is no dialogue in the music video and the two policemen are loosely modeled after Chage and Aska.

==Analysis==
Miyazaki offered an interpretation of the angel as &quot;Hope&quot; and to protect hope could paradoxically mean &quot;to let it go where no-one can touch it&quot;. Miyazaki said that in the music video&#x27;s setting, humans live in an underground city after the surface of the Earth has been contaminated with radiation, creating a sanctuary for nature. Miyazaki did not find this believable, though, as humanity would suffer on the surface instead. Miyazaki intentionally misinterpreted the lyrics to reflect upon the vision of a world filled with disease and radiation and people&#x27;s reactions to that world. He implied the two policemen might not be able to return to their old life, but offered no reason as to why.

Miyazaki referred to the angelic creature as &quot;tori no hito&quot; or &quot;a bird&#x27;s person&quot; which is the nickname of Nausicaä from his &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; manga and film. 

During their April 1999 lecture series on manga, anime and the works of Miyazaki at the University of Dallas, Pamela Gossin, Professor of Arts and Humanities, and guest instructor Marc Hairston, research scientist in the William B. Hanson Center for Space Sciences, discussed &quot;On Your Mark&quot; in their lecture, &quot;In the &quot;Coda On Your Mark and Nausicaa&quot;, and drew parallels to the &quot;Nausicaä&quot; story, its titular character and its conclusion. Gossin and Hairston interpreted the release of the winged girl at the end of the video as Miyazaki setting free his character in a manner reminiscent of William Shakespeare&#x27;s symbolic liberation of his characters, through Prospero&#x27;s release of his servant Ariel in his play The Tempest. The final volume of the &quot;Nausicaä&quot; manga was released in January 1995. Miyazaki started creating &quot;On Your Mark&quot; that same month.

McCarthy highlighted similarities to different works and real life found throughout the film, remarking that the opening city sequence could be an homage to &quot;Akira&quot; or &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and the attack on the religious cult could be a reflection of the Aum Shinrikyo movement. Nausicaa.net stated the production occurred prior to the police raid following the Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March 1995. McCarthy also noted that the film&#x27;s scientists&#x27; decontamination gear look like the hero of &quot;Porco Rosso&quot; and the rescue scene is reminiscent of Princess Leia in Star Wars. The encased or &quot;box&quot; structure in the film is an homage to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant which was entombed in concrete following the Chernobyl disaster.

The animation scholar Seiji Kanō observed that the urban settings have a &quot;China Town style&quot; and resemble the cityscapes of Mamoru Oshii&#x27;s &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; animated film adaptation, in production at the time. While Miyazaki has been non-committal about the nature of his winged entity in &quot;On your Mark&quot;, Kanō noted that the manga &quot;Seraphim 266613336Wings&quot;, an unfinished collaborative effort by Oshii and Satoshi Kon, with its &quot;Angel Disease&quot; theme, was still serialized in Animage at the time Miyazaki was creating &quot;On Your Mark&quot; in 1995.

==Reception==
The music video was well received. Dr. Patrick Collins, a science writer, called it &quot;the most perfect short science fantasy film I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; McCarter of &quot;EX Magazine&quot; praised the film&#x27;s attention to detail that brought the world to life. &quot;THEM Anime&quot; praised the music video and said that it alone was worth the price of &quot;Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short Short&quot;.

==Releases==
The music video was released theatrically with &quot;Whisper of the Heart&quot; on July 15, 1995. Chage and Aska also used the film in concerts. The first official screening took place at their fan club concert, held at the Makuhari Messe in Chiba, on June 29, 1995. Beginning July 5, 1995, the video was shown for the performance of the song during the &quot;Super Best 3 Mission Impossible&quot; tour. Featuring the same melody but different lyrics than &quot;On Your Mark&quot;, &quot;Castles in the Air&quot; was included on the English-language album &quot;One Voice: The Songs of Chage &amp; Aska&quot;.

On April 10, 1996, during an airing on Channel 4 as part of Four-Mations.

The music video was later released on VHS and Laserdisc by Pony Canyon on July 25, 1997, due to popular demand.

On November 15, 2005, it was included on Buena Vista Home Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short Short&quot; DVD, where it can be played with either the original &quot;On Your Mark&quot; or &quot;Castles in the Air&quot; songs.

It was planned to be included on the &quot;Hayao Miyazaki Collection&quot;, but after Aska (Shigeaki Miyazaki) of the musical duo Chage and Aska was arrested for drug possession, Walt Disney Studios Japan removed &quot;On Your Mark&quot; from the upcoming DVD/Blu-ray box set containing Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s works, delayed the release by two weeks in order to remove the video and ceased shipments of &quot;Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short Short&quot;.

On October 27, 2014, Studio Ghibli&#x27;s Toshio Suzuki announced on the company&#x27;s web page that they and Disney had re-considered the situation and would be sending out Blu-ray discs to purchasers of the Hayao Miyazaki box set, as long as they could provide proof of purchase. These standalone releases were self-distributed by Studio Ghibli for this reason.

On April 10, 2019, Walt Disney Japan announced the Blu-ray and DVD release of &quot;Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short Short 1992-2016&quot;, an expanded edition of &quot;Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short Short&quot; that includes titles released after 2005. &quot;On Your Mark&quot; is on the disc, and it was released on July 17, 2019.

<text>Llangammarch Wells, or simply Llangammarch ( ), is a village and community in Powys, Wales, lying on the Afon Irfon, and in the historic county of Brecknockshire (Breconshire).

It is the smallest of the four spa villages of mid-Wales, alongside Llandrindod Wells, Builth Wells and Llanwrtyd Wells. The spa was focused on a barium well, which is now closed.
The old village is centred on the parish church of St Cadmarch, which is a grade II* listed building.
Llangammarch station is on the Heart of Wales Line with trains provided by Transport for Wales. It lies on Route 43 of the National Cycle Network.

Llangammarch Wells Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1904. The club and course disappeared in the 1950s.

The community includes the small settlements of Tirabad and Cefn Gorwydd, birthplace of John Penry (1563 – 29 May 1593) the martyr, who was born at Cefn Brith farm. The farm is signposted but the old farmhouse is not the original building.

==Governance==
For elections to Powys County Council, Llangamarch is covered by the Llanwrtyd Wells electoral ward.
== Notable people ==
* John Penry (1563–1593), executed for high treason during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, is Wales&#x27; most famous Protestant Separatist martyr.
* Thomas Howell (1588–1650), clergyman and Bishop of Bristol from 1644 to 1646.
* T. Harri Jones (1921–1965), a Welsh poet and university lecturer, commemorated by a statue in the town

<text>The Gramophone Classical Music Awards, launched in 1977, are one of the most significant honours bestowed on recordings in the classical record industry. The British awards are often viewed as equivalent to or surpassing the American Grammy awards, and referred to as the &quot;Oscars&quot; for classical music. They are widely regarded as the most influential and prestigious classical music awards in the world. According to Matthew Owen, national sales manager for Harmonia Mundi USA, &quot;ultimately it is &quot;the&quot; classical award, especially worldwide.&quot;

The winners are selected annually by critics for the &quot;&quot;Gramophone&quot;&quot; magazine and various members of the industry, including retailers, broadcasters, arts administrators, and musicians. Awards are usually presented in September each year in London.

<doc id="621955" wikidata="Q553152" url="?curid=621955" title="Pedro Menéndez de Avilés">
<text>Pedro Menéndez de Avilés (; ; 15 February 1519 – 17 September 1574) was a Spanish admiral, explorer and conquistador from Avilés, in Asturias, Spain. He is notable for planning the first regular trans-oceanic convoys, which became known as the Spanish treasure fleet, and for founding St. Augustine, Florida, in 1565. This was the first successful European settlement in La Florida and the most significant city in the region for nearly three centuries. 

St. Augustine is the oldest continuously inhabited, European-established settlement in the continental United States. Menéndez de Avilés was the first governor of &quot;La Florida&quot; (1565–74). By his contract, or &quot;asiento&quot;, with Philip II, Menéndez was appointed adelantado and was responsible for implementing royal policies to build fortifications for the defense of conquered territories in &quot;La Florida&quot; and to establish Castilian governmental institutions in desirable areas.

==Early years==
Pedro Menéndez de Avilés was born to an old noble family in the kingdom of Asturias. He was one of the younger sons of Juan Alonso Sánchez de Avilés, who had served the Catholic Monarchs in the war of War of Granada, and María Alonso y Menéndez Arango. His parents had twenty children, and Pedro was still a child when his father died.

After Doña Maria remarried, Pedro was sent to live with a relative who promised to oversee his education. Pedro and his guardian did not get along, and he ran away from home. He was found six months later in Valladolid and taken back to his foster home. Eventually Menéndez entered the military and went off to fight in one of the wars with France. He served at sea in a small armada against the French corsairs who harassed the maritime commerce of Spain.

==Military career==

After two years of fighting, Menéndez returned to his family, having conceived a plan to use part of his inheritance to build his own vessel. He built a &quot;patache&quot;, a small but fast row-sailer, suitable for patrolling the coast. He recruited a number of his relatives to sail with him in search of adventure.

In this ship, the young Menéndez won his first victory of command in an engagement with French corsairs who had attacked three slow Spanish freighters off the coast of Galicia. By effective captainship, he separated the two swift &quot;zabras&quot; (Biscayan frigates) that pursued him and captured them both, and drove away the third. The exploits of Pedro Menéndez soon became a topic of conversation on the waterfronts of Spain and France, and in the royal courts. Meanwhile, the Seville merchants and the Casa de Contratación (House of Trade) were chagrined by Menéndez&#x27;s success and his growing influence with the Crown.

===Treasure fleet===
Menéndez is credited as the Spanish leader who first surveyed and authorized the building of the royal fortresses at major Caribbean ports. He was appointed by the Crown in 1554 as Captain-General of the Fleet of the Indies, the Spanish treasure fleet; that year he departed with the fleet and brought it back safely to Spain. He was affirmed in his belief of the strategic importance of the Bahama Channel and that Havana, on the island of Cuba, was the key port to conduct a rendezvous of the annual &quot;Flota&quot; of treasure galleons. The appointment was highly prestigious, and it was unusual for the Crown to make the appointment. In the past the Casa de Contratación had controlled this position.

King Phillip II and Menéndez maintained a close relationship. The Crown invited him to be a part of the Royal Party when Phillip married Mary I, Queen of England.

In 1559, Philip II again appointed Menéndez as Captain General, and his brother Bartolomé Menéndez as Admiral, of the Fleet of the Indies. He sailed for the Indies that October as captain general and commanded the galleons of the great &quot;Armada de la Carrera&quot;, or Spanish Treasure Fleet, on their return voyage from the Caribbean and Mexico to Spain. Menéndez determined the route they followed, which led through the Florida Strait () and up the east coast of Florida, taking advantage of the current of the Gulf Stream. In 1561, however, Menéndez was jailed by Casa officials for alleged smuggling, but he got his case transferred to court and won his release.

Menéndez is credited as the chief planner of the formalized Spanish treasure fleet convoy system that became the main link between Spain and her overseas territories. In partnership with Álvaro de Bazán, 1st Marquis of Santa Cruz, he helped design the great galleons that carried the trade between Cadiz in Spain and Vera Cruz in Spanish Mexico.

Later, in his capacity as &quot;adelantado&quot;, Menéndez was required to explore this vast territory, which extended from the Gulf coast of present-day western Florida around the Florida keys to Newfoundland. He also was commanded by the king to establish two or three fortified &quot;presidios&quot; and settle them with settlers and slaves, and to begin the conversion of the Indians to Catholicism.

===Enterprise of &quot;La Florida&quot;===
In 1562, a group of Huguenots led by Jean Ribault arrived in territory claimed by Spain and called La Florida. They explored the mouth of the St. Johns River in Florida, calling it &quot;la Rivière de Mai&quot; (the River May). The French sailed northward and established a settlement called Charlesfort at Port Royal Sound in present-day South Carolina.

On 19 August 1563, Pedro Menéndez and his brother Bartolomé were imprisoned by the Casa de Contratación, accused of accepting bribes and smuggling silver into Spain. In September, he received news that &quot;La Concepción&quot;, flagship of the New Spain fleet and commanded by his son Admiral Juan Menéndez, had disappeared off the coast of South Carolina, and was assumed to be dead. The ship was lost in a hurricane that scattered the fleet as it was returning to Spain, at the latitude of Bermuda off the coast of South Carolina. Menéndez conceived a plan for a voyage to &quot;La Florida&quot; to search for his son, who he believed might have reached there, but he was powerless to initiate it from prison, and his petitions to King Philip II went unanswered.

Spain learned of the French expedition to Florida through its spies at ports on the Atlantic coast of France. Philip II was alarmed when Dr. Gabriel de Enveja reported that Jean Ribault had been appointed as &quot;Captain-General and Viceroy of New France&quot;. He also said that a large expedition of ships, soldiers and supplies was being fitted at Dieppe for a voyage to Florida: it was to have more than 500 arquebusiers, and many dismounted bronze cannons were loaded aboard the vessels.

After his release from prison, Menéndez was available again to serve the king&#x27;s purposes. He was appointed as &quot;adelantado&quot; of &quot;La Florida&quot;, with the promise of a large land grant and the title of marquis if he was successful. He advised the king of the strategic importance of exploring the Florida coast for discovery of trade passages to the riches of China and Molucca. There was the hope that such waterways might also lead to the mines of New Spain in central Mexico and to the Pacific. He proposed colonizing several areas to defend the territory against incursions by the Indians and foreign powers.

Menéndez expected to make vast profits for himself and to increase the royal treasury with this Florida enterprise, as it was to include the development of agriculture, fisheries, and naval stores. This ambitious venture was supported materially and politically by his kinship alliance of seventeen families from northern Spain, all tied by blood relations and marriage. They pledged their persons and fortunes to the adelentado, hoping to enrich themselves later with large grants of lands and royal honors of civil and military offices in &quot;La Florida&quot;. This support gave Menéndez a loyal cadre of lieutenants and officials who had blood connection to him, and had invested their own futures in his success.

In early 1564 Menéndez asked permission to go to Florida to search for &quot;La Concepcion&quot; and his son, Admiral Juan Menéndez, who had been its commander. As noted above, they were lost in 1563 in a hurricane. The crown continued to refuse his request.

René de Laudonnière, a Huguenot aristocrat who had participated in the first Jean Ribault expedition, returned to Florida in 1564 with three ships and 300 Huguenot colonists. He reached the River May on 22 June 1564, sailed up it a few miles, and founded Fort Caroline. The Crown was alarmed by these encroachments on Spanish territory in such proximity to the course of the Spanish treasure fleet.

Desiring to protect its claimed territories in North America against further incursions by European powers, the Spanish Crown issued an &quot;asiento&quot; to Menéndez, signed by Philip II on 20 March 1565, granting him expansive trade privileges, the power to distribute lands, and licenses to sell 500 slaves, as well as various titles, including that of &quot;adelantado&quot; of Florida. Menéndez was commissioned to reconnoiter North America from the Florida Keys to present-day Canada, and report on its coastal features, with a view to establishing a permanent settlement for the defense of the Spanish treasure fleet. He was ordered as well to drive away any intruders who were not subjects of the Spanish crown.

On 28 July 1565, Menéndez set sail from Cádiz with a fleet led by his 600-ton flagship, the &quot;San Pelayo&quot;, accompanied by several smaller ships, and carrying over 1,000 sailors, soldiers, and settlers. On the feast day of St. Augustine, 28 August, the fleet sighted land and anchored off the north inlet of the tidal channel that the French called the River of Dolphins. This was developed as the site of the present-day city of St. Augustine. Menéndez sailed north and confronted Ribault&#x27;s fleet outside the bar of the River May in a brief skirmish. On 6 September, he returned to his first landfall, naming the site it after the Catholic saint, disembarked his troops, and quickly constructed fortifications to protect his people and supplies.

Father Francisco López de Mendoza Grajales, the chaplain of the expedition, celebrated the first Thanksgiving Mass on the grounds. The formal Franciscan outpost, Mission Nombre de Dios, was founded at the landing point, perhaps the first mission in what would become the continental United States. The mission served nearby villages of the Mocama, a Timucua group, and was at the center of an important chiefdom in the late 16th and 17th century.

Menéndez marched his soldiers overland from St. Augustine to destroy the French settlement at Fort Caroline on the St. Johns River. On 20 September 1565, they made a surprise attack and killed all the adult males they encountered, but spared women and children; 132 Frenchmen were killed. Laudonnière and several score Frenchmen escaped into the woods. Menéndez left a Spanish garrison at the captured fort, now renamed San Mateo. (In 1568 French soldiers led by Dominique de Gourgues returned and destroyed it, killing the Spanish garrison in retaliation for the 1565 massacre.)

Menéndez pursued Jean Ribault, who had already left with four ships to attack the Spanish at St. Augustine. After Ribault had put out to sea, he was surprised by a storm that wrecked three of his ships near what is now the Ponce de Leon Inlet. His flagship was grounded near present-day Cape Canaveral. Informed by Indian allies that the French survivors were walking northward on the coast, Menéndez began to search for them, finding the party at the banks of the Matanzas River&#x27;s south entrance. After several parleys with the Spanish, Ribault and the 150–350 Frenchmen with him (sources differ) surrendered. The Spanish executed nearly all of them in the dunes near the inlet. It was later known as &quot;Matanzas&quot; (Spanish for &quot;slaughters&quot;). Having taken control of the Florida coast, Menéndez had his soldiers complete the fort in St. Augustine. He also established missions to the natives for the Catholic Church, and explored the east coast and interior of the peninsula.

In May 1566, as relations with the neighboring Timucua Indians deteriorated, Menéndez moved the Spanish settlement to a more defensible position on the north end of the barrier island between the mainland and the sea, building a wooden fort there. In 1572, the settlement was relocated to the mainland, in the area just south of the future town plaza. Secure as governor, Menéndez explored the area and built additional fortifications.

He also commissioned the Juan Pardo expedition, to travel from Santa Elena, at Port Royal Sound in present-day South Carolina, into the interior of the Southeast. Captain Pardo was to find and supply an alternate overland route to the Spanish silver mines in central Mexico, as the Spanish mistakenly thought the Appalachian Mountains were part of a range extending that far. In the next couple of years, Pardo and his men traveled into present-day South Carolina and Western North Carolina, stopping at the Mississippian chiefdom of Joara, where they built Fort San Juan and wintered over. In total, his expedition built six forts along this route, including one known as San Pedro at Olamico, the principal town of Chiaha in southeastern Tennessee. Pardo left the expedition for other business. In 1568 all the Spanish men but one in the garrisons were killed by Native Americans resisting their treatment, and the forts were destroyed. The Spanish did not attempt other colonization in this region.

Confident that he had fulfilled his primary contract with the King, including construction of forts along the coast of &quot;La Florida&quot;, Menéndez returned to Spain in 1567. He was appointed governor of Cuba, in October of that year. After several more transatlantic crossings, Menéndez fell ill and died on 17 September 1574.

==Later years==
Menéndez traveled to southwest Florida, looking for his son. There he made contact with the Calusa tribe, an advanced maritime people, at what is now known as Charlotte harbor. He negotiated an initial peace with their leader, Carlos, which was solidified by Menéndez&#x27;s marriage to Carlos&#x27;s sister, who took the baptismal name Doña Antonia. The peace was uneasy, and Menéndez&#x27;s use of his new wife as a hostage in negotiations with her people, as well as his negotiating with the Calusas&#x27; enemies, the Tocobagas, helped cause the decline of relations to all out war, which continued intermittently into the next century. Menéndez was unsuccessful in locating his son Juan.

Establishing a Spanish garrison of 200 men further up the coast, he sailed to what is today the Georgia coast making contact with the local Indians of St. Catherines Island before returning to Florida, where he expanded Spanish power throughout southeastern Florida. His position as governor now secure, Menéndez explored the area and built additional fortifications. In 1567, he marched south and encountered the Ais (Jece) as he reached the Indian River near present-day Vero Beach. He returned to Spain in 1567 and was appointed governor of Cuba, in October of that year.

In December 1571, Menéndez was sailing from Florida to Havana with two frigates when, as he tells it, &quot;I was wrecked at Cape Canaveral because of a storm which came upon me, and the other boat was lost fifteen leagues further on in the Bahama Channel, in a river they call the Ais, because the &quot;cacique&quot; (chief) is so called. I, by a miracle reached the fort of St. Augustine with seventeen persons I was taking with me. Three times the Indians gave the order to attack me, and the way I escaped them was by ingenuity and arousing fear in them, telling them that behind me many Spaniards were coming who would slay them if they found them.&quot; The Ais, like the Tequesta and Calusa tribes, proved hostile to Spanish settlement as war continued on and off until 1670.

Menéndez later made contact with the less hostile Tequesta at their capital in &quot;El Portal&quot; (in what is now Miami) and was able to negotiate for three chieftains to accompany him to Cuba as translators to the Arawak. Although Menéndez left behind Jesuit missionaries Brother Francisco de Villareal and Padre Rogel in an attempt to convert the Tequesta to Roman Catholicism, the tribe were indifferent to their teachings. The Jesuits returned to St. Augustine after a year.

Menéndez voyaged to &quot;La Florida&quot; for the last time in 1571, with 650 settlers for Santa Elena, as well as his wife and family. In August 1572, Menéndez led a ship with thirty soldiers and sailors to take revenge for the killing of the Jesuits of the Ajacán Mission in present-day Virginia. At the end of his life, he was appointed as governor of Cuba shortly after his arrival. Menéndez died of typhus at Santander, Spain, on 17 September 1574.

<doc id="621956" wikidata="Q2214089" url="?curid=621956" title="Llanwrtyd Wells">
<text>Llanwrtyd Wells ( &quot;church of St Gwrtud&quot;) is a market town and community in Powys, Wales, in the historic county of Brecknockshire (Breconshire) on the Afon Irfon. The town is on the A483 between Llandovery and Builth Wells and is located near the pass between the Tywi and Irfon valleys.

The community also includes the smaller settlements of Llanwrtyd and Abergwesyn, the valley of the Afon Irfon, and a large part of the &quot;Desert of Wales&quot;.

With a population of 850 (United Kingdom Census 2011), it claims to be the smallest town in Britain, although Fordwich in Kent has a smaller population.

== History ==
Llanwrtyd Wells grew in the 19th century as a spa town around the &quot;Ffynnon Ddrewllyd&quot; (&quot;stinking well&quot;), 1.5 miles from the much older settlement of Llanwrtyd. The town was also known as an eisteddfod site, and is the site of both the World Bog Snorkelling Championships and the annual Man versus Horse Marathon, as well as other annual events.

The Abernant Lake Hotel was built on the site of an old farm, to cater for the many visitors, keen to take the spa waters. The hotel grounds include a lake created in 1903 by damming an oxbow of the Irfon. During World War II, the hotel was home to Bromsgrove School, evacuated from Worcestershire, and from 1943–45 to the Czechoslovak State School for Refugee Children. It remained as a hotel until 2007 when it became home to a multi-activity centre for school groups and families.

Llanwrtyd Wells had two golf clubs and courses during the 20th century, both now defunct. The early course was at the Dol-y-coed Hotel and the later one at Abernant Lake Hotel.

==Cambrian Mill==

Built in 1852, the Cambrian Woollen Mill was the largest woollen mill in the Llanidloes area, employing over 250 workers at its peak. It was reduced to an empty shell by a fire in November 1889, but rebuilt in 1902 and has been in continuous operation since then. It is one of very few woolen mills still operating in Wales. According to the mill&#x27;s website, visitors can experience &quot;700 years of weaving history&quot;.

==Spa==
Following the discovery in 1732 by the Rev. Theophilus Evans of waters claimed to have healing properties, Llanwrtyd Wells became a spa town. (In 1740 Wales&#x27; most famous hymn-writer, William Williams Pantycelyn was appointed curate to Evans.) 
The spa was referred to as &quot;Ffynnon Ddrewllyd&quot; &quot;Stinking Well&quot; because of the strong smell of hydrogen sulfide. The spa is located at the site of the Dol-y-Coed Hotel, now the home of Charcroft Electronics.

The fashion for spas reached its peak in the Victorian era and many of the hotels in the town date back to that time. The Belle Vue Hotel, the only purpose-built hotel in Llanwrtyd, was built in 1843.

==Modern times==
In contrast to its history as a spa town, when hundreds flocked to take the waters for their claimed medicinal effects, the area is now better known for recreations such as pony trekking, mountain biking, walking and birdwatching, and for its annual Man versus Horse Marathon, Beer Festival, World Bog Snorkeling Championship and Welsh Open stone skimming championship. The World Record for the longest distance a stone has been skimmed was set on Abernant Lake by Dougie Isaacs, a Scotsman. The town&#x27;s largest employer Charcroft Electronics is located in buildings which were previously the Dol-y-Coed Hotel. The hotel, on the banks of the Irfon, dates from about 1535.

In 1984 the town was the location for the filming of the BBC sitcom &quot;The Magnificent Evans&quot;, written by Roy Clarke and starring Ronnie Barker, Sharon Morgan and Myfanwy Talog.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Llanwrtyd Wells, at community (town) and county level: Llanwrtyd Wells Town Council and Powys County Council. The town council meets at the Institute on Irfon Terrace.

A Llanwrtyd Wells electoral ward exists, which also includes the neighbouring communities of Llangammarch Wells and Treflys. This ward had a population of 1,875 at the 2011 Census.

===Administrative history===
Llanwrtyd was an ancient parish in the historic county of Brecknockshire. When elected parish and district councils were established in 1894 it was given a parish council and administered by the Llandovery Rural District, most of which was in Carmarthenshire. Llanwrtyd was transferred to the Builth Rural District in 1898. In 1907 part of the old parish of Llanwrtyd was converted into an urban district called Llanwrtyd Wells. The remainder of the old parish outside the urban district became a separate parish called Llanwrtyd Without.

Llanwrtyd Wells Urban District was abolished in 1974, with its area becoming a community called Llanwrtyd Wells instead. District-level functions passed to Brecknock Borough Council, which in turn was abolished in 1996 and its functions passed to Powys County Council. The Llanwrtyd Wells and Llanwrtyd Without communities were merged into a single community called Llanwrtyd Wells in 1986, which also took in the Abergwesyn area to the north.

== Transport ==
Unlike many small towns in rural Wales, Llanwrtyd station still has a passenger train service. Heart of Wales line trains between Swansea and Shrewsbury call four times a day each way Monday to Saturday and twice each way on Sunday (2019 timetable)

==Notable residents==
The town is the home of Robin Kevan, also known as &quot;Rob the Rubbish&quot;, who has become famous for his efforts to clean up Britain&#x27;s countryside.

<text>Llandrindod Wells (; ; , ; ) is a town and community in Powys, Wales. It serves as the seat of Powys County Council, and is therefore the administrative centre of Powys. The town was historically in Radnorshire.

Llandrindod Wells developed as a spa town in the 19th century, with a boom in the late 20th century as a centre of local government. Before the 1860s the site of the town was common land in Llanfihangel Cefnllys parish. Llandrindod Wells is the fifth largest town in Powys. The population as of the 2021 UK census was 5,602, an increase on the previous census.

==History==

During the mid-18th century, the &#x27;healing qualities&#x27; of the local spring waters attracted visitors to the area resulting in an economic boom with the building of a &#x27;splendid&#x27; hotel at Llandrindod Hall. A period of relative decline during the late 18th and early 19th centuries was reversed with the construction of the Heart of Wales line making Llandrindod accessible from south Wales, the Midlands and northwest England. Enclosure of the common in 1862 enabled the expansion of the town with the construction of new streets, hotels, shops and houses.

During the &#x27;season&#x27; between May and mid-September, visitors would take the waters at the pump rooms at the Rock Park and Pump House Hotel, entertained by orchestras. Hotels, boarding houses and shops—including the Central Wales Emporium on the corner of Temple Street and Station Crescent—provided for the visitors. In the early 1870s, an ornamental lake was formed by draining marshland near the Pump House Hotel (on the current site of the Council offices), and in 1893 a 9-hole golf course was opened on the common beside the lake (later replaced by the present 18-hole course on the hills above). Horse races (and later air displays) were held on the Rock Ddole meadow beside the river.

In 1893, Archdeacon Henry de Winton, who had responsibility for the area at the time, had Llandrindod old church and Cefnllys church unroofed in order to persuade the congregations to attend the new church in the centre of the town. Both churches were later restored in 1895 following protest. 

Llandrindod was the place of the election of the first Archbishop of Wales in 1920, which occurred at the Old Parish Church. Elections for every Archbishop since have continued to be held in Llandrindod, now at Holy Trinity Church in the Town Centre. In 1907, a Catholic church was founded in the town, Our Lady of Ransom and the Holy Souls Church.
The town has maintained an important profile in the world of motoring and motorsport. Apart from two of its most symbolic recent buildings being the Tom Norton&#x27;s Automobile Palace and Pritchard&#x27;s Garage, it served as the base for many International motorcycle events such as the International Six Days Trial ISDT starting in 1933 with the last visit taking place in 1961, often drawing in crowds of thousands to watch.

The town&#x27;s boom continued until the First World War during which time soldiers on training courses were billeted in hotels and boarding houses, and refugees and wounded soldiers were accommodated in the town. The Great Depression of the late-1920s and 1930s led to many hotels and boarding houses being turned into private homes and flats. During the Second World War the town was again used for military hospitals and billets, followed by a slump in the post-war years. The Beeching Axe resulted in the closure in the mid-1960s of the Mid-Wales line and with it Llandrindod&#x27;s connection from nearby Builth Wells direct to Cardiff and to north and west Wales. The town does retain connections to Swansea and Shrewsbury from Llandrindod railway station on the Heart of Wales line.

Prior to 1974, the town housed much of the administration of Radnorshire, although the official county town was Presteigne. The reorganisation of local government in 1974 resulted in Llandrindod becoming the county town of the newly formed administrative county of Powys. This led to an influx of people employed by the new bureaucracies, on salaries determined by national pay scales. The new County Hall was based on Spa Road East in Llandrindod Wells.

In a 2017 survey undertaken by Rightmove, Llandrindod was voted the Happiest Place in Wales. A survey by the Royal Mail over the Easter 2018 period showed that Llandrindod had the highest online shopping rates for that period in the whole of the country.

==Climate==
==Governance==
Three county electoral wards lie within the boundaries of the town which each elect a councillor to Powys County Council: Llandrindod East/West, Llandrindod North and Llandrindod South. 

Llandrindod Town Council is responsible for the provision, upkeep and maintenance of a number of public spaces and services. Llandrindod Wells Town Council has up to 15 town councillors (elected from five community wards).

==Notable landmarks==

The architecture of the town includes many buildings in ornate styles dating from the boom period of the Victorian and Edwardian eras including the Metropole, the Glen Usk and the Gwalia hotels, The Albert Hall, and Llandrindod railway station which built in 1865. The Old Town Hall, which was originally commissioned as a doctor&#x27;s home and surgery, was completed in 1872.

There are also buildings in the Art Deco style including two former garages, Pritchard&#x27;s and the Automobile Palace. The latter was notable for a collection of antique bicycles owned by the proprietor, Tom Norton, which were displayed suspended from ceilings in the building. The building has in recent years been renovated and is now home to several small businesses and the National Cycle Collection, featuring some of the bicycles originally displayed in the garage.

The largest of the town&#x27;s hotels are the Metropole (with 120 bedrooms of 4 star standard, an indoor swimming pool and leisure centre), the Glen Usk and the Commodore. The Hotel Metropole&#x27;s swimming pool used to be open-air and was open to the public but is now reserved for guests.
A large man-made lake in the town is used for fishing and model boating. The lake houses a sculpture of a water serpent and leaping carp, the scales of which are made of thousands of copper plates initialed by local people and visitors during construction of the work. Beside the lake, sits a distinctive tree-trunk sculpture known as a &#x27;Llandoddie&#x27;, one of many such sculptures distributed throughout the town. In May 2018, pedalo boats for hire were launched onto Llandrindod Lake, as part of a £158,000 regeneration project. Llandrindod Wells&#x27; parks are listed, as a collective, on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales. The Grade II* listing reflects the parks&#x27; significant role in the &quot;development of Llandrindod Wells as a flourishing spa town&quot;.

An 18-hole golf course, which features challenging topology and views over the lake, was established in 1905.

The town has three international standard outdoor bowling greens dating from 1912 which hosts national and international events and has recently been voted ‘the best facilities in the whole of the British Isles’. A newer indoor bowling centre, can also be found in the centre of the town.

Llandrindod Wells County War Memorial Hospital was opened in 1881.

==Culture==

Llandrindod Wells Victorian Festival is held in the town every year at the end of August. Many locals and some visitors dress in Victorian, Edwardian or other antique costumes, and many of the town&#x27;s shops and other high-street businesses dress their windows or otherwise join in the spirit of the event. The festival typically offers open-air and street theatre and music, a fairground, a craft fair, an historical re-enactment, entertainments at The Albert Hall and exhibitions of &quot;things old-time&quot;.

There is a wide range of entertainment available in the town each year. The Albert Hall, Llandrindod Wells is the town&#x27;s Victorian Theatre, owned and run by the community of Llandrindod. The Theatre is managed by a group of volunteers from the local area. The theatre hosts a wide range of performances and activities suitable for all. Many local organisation&#x27;s events are held at the Theatre.

Pavilion Mid Wales (formerly known as The Grand Pavilion) is the largest venue in Llandrindod Wells, and hosts a wide range of entertainments, including Arts, Music, Conferences, and Markets.

The town hosts annual Welsh 2 Day Enduro in June. The enduro started in 1952, and is the UK&#x27;s biggest time card motorcycle Enduro event. The event covers 300 miles, over 2 days, with 500 competitors. 

A typical year of events within the town looks like this:

<doc id="621960" wikidata="Q281859" url="?curid=621960" title="Vagankovo Cemetery">
<text>Vagankovo Cemetery () is located in the Presnensky District of Moscow, Russia. It was established in 1771, in an effort to curb an outbreak of bubonic plague in Central Russia. The cemetery was one of those created outside the city proper so as to prevent the contagion from spreading.

More than 500,000 people are estimated to have been buried at Vagankovo Cemetery from 1771 to 1990. As of 1990, the cemetery contained slightly more than 100,000 graves. The vast necropolis contains the mass graves from the Battle of Borodino, the Battle of Moscow, and the Khodynka Tragedy. It is the burial site for many prominent people from the academic, artistic, military, and sports communities of Russia and the old Soviet Union. 

The cemetery is served by several Orthodox churches constructed between 1819 and 1823 in the Muscovite version of the Empire style.

== History ==
=== Imperial era ===
Since its beginning as a minor city, burying the dead—with some exceptions—at places of worship had been the custom in Moscow, like other cities in Russia. Peter the Great did not like tombstones on the church ground because he saw them as a hindrance to church ceremonies and disrespect for the church. In 1723, he issued a decree that, in all cities in the Empire, only &quot;eminent persons&quot; should be buried in churches, and the rest in monasteries or parish churches outside cities. This decree was not enforced, however, as he died shortly afterwards in 1725—leaving the custom of burying the dead in churches unchanged.

In 1771, Catherine the Great, in an effort to curb the bubonic plague epidemic in Central Russia, by decree forbade her subjects to bury those who had died of the plague in any monastery or church cemetery in Moscow. The Muscovites were told to bury the dead instead only in the churches assigned to them according to their residential districts. Six &quot;special churches&quot; outside the city limits were designated for this purpose. One of them was at Vagankovo near Presnya (present-day Presnensky District); the dead from the first, third, and half of the fifth district of Moscow were to be sent there for burials.

=== Soviet era ===
American political scientist William Taubman wrote that, during the Great Purge, alcohol-soused guards would execute weeping prisoners after the latter had dug their own graves in the cemetery.

<text>Llanwrtyd is a small settlement in Powys, mid-Wales, in the historic county of Brecknockshire (Breconshire), through which flows the River Irfon. It lies 1.5 miles north of the town of Llanwrtyd Wells.

Llanwrtyd was historically the centre of a much larger parish which included Llanwrtyd Wells. The name Llanwrtyd is shared with the ancient parish, and is also sometimes applied to Llanwrtyd Wells (particularly in Welsh). The current community is called Llanwrtyd Wells, and includes Llanwrtyd, Llanwrtyd Wells and Abergwesyn.

==Origin of the name==
The Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust (CPAT) survey suggests that the name Llanwrtyd is a combination of church (&quot;llan&quot;) and a name &quot;Gwrtud&quot; or &quot;Gwrtyd&quot;, (&quot;Gwrtyd&#x27;s Church&quot;). The present dedication to Saint David, in whose diocese the church stands, is likely later. The earliest documented reference, to &quot;Llanworted&quot;, dates from 1543. The traditional derivation of the name is given in the Reverend Thomas Morgan&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of the Origin of Pace-names in Wales and Monmouthshire&quot;. This suggests the name comes from &quot;Llanddewi wrth y rhyd&quot; (David&#x27;s church by the ford). Again, tradition says that the church was founded by St David in the 6th century and the CPAT survey notes the curved boundary around the churchyard and its siting by a river, both features which indicate that the church was established before the Norman Conquest. The church was a chapel attached to Llangammarch.

==History==
Llanwrtyd was an ancient parish, a curacy attached to the vicarage of Llangammarch. The parish church of St David dates from the 11th century and is a Grade II* listed building.

Theophilus Jones, in his &quot;A History of the County of Brecknock&quot;, was fairly disparaging of the parish; when describing the church he states &quot;there is nothing deserving of notice in this miserable fabric, unless it be an inscription on the wall, to the memory of an old woman of the name of Jones.&quot;

In 1740 the curate in the parishes of Llanwrtyd, Llanfihangel Abergwesyn and Llanddewi Abergwesyn, was Wales&#x27; most famous hymn-writer William Williams Pantycelyn.

The population in 1801 was about 500 which had risen to 854 by the 1901 census. After the coming of the railway in 1867 the parish played host to at least 12,000 visitors annually to drink the mineral waters at the sulphur springs about a mile and a half down river from the church, and the small town of Llanwrtyd Wells at the springs became the main population centre of the parish. In 1897 the church of St James was built in Llanwrtyd Wells.

Thomas Powel (1845–1922) was born in Llanwrtyd. He became a Welsh Celtic scholar and Professor of Celtic at University College, Cardiff from 1884 to 1918.

The parish became a civil parish (sometimes known in English as Llanwrtud). In 1907 the parish was split when Llanwrtyd Wells was made an urban district. The parish of Llanwrtyd was reduced to cover the same area as the Llanwrtyd Wells Urban District, and the remainder of the old parish became a separate civil parish called Llanwrtyd Without. When civil parishes and urban districts were abolished in Wales in 1974, the former urban district became a community called Llanwrtyd Wells and Llanwrtyd Without also became a community. The two were merged into a single community called Llanwrtyd Wells in 1986.

<text>The Jelling stones () are massive carved runestones from the 10th century, found at the town of Jelling in Denmark. The older of the two Jelling stones was raised by King Gorm the Old in memory of his wife Thyra. The larger of the two stones was raised by King Gorm&#x27;s son, Harald Bluetooth, in memory of his parents, celebrating his conquest of Denmark and Norway, and his conversion of the Danes to Christianity.

The runic inscriptions on these stones are considered the best known in Denmark. In 1994, the stones, in addition to the burial mounds and small church nearby, were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as an unparalleled example of both pagan and Christian Nordic culture. 

==Significance==

The stones are strongly identified with the creation of Denmark as a nation state. Both inscriptions mention the name &quot;Danmark&quot; (in the form of accusative &quot;tanmaurk&quot; () on the large stone, and genitive &quot;tanmarkar&quot; (pronounced ) on the small stone).

The larger stone explicitly mentions the conversion of Denmark from Norse paganism and the process of Christianisation, alongside a depiction of the crucified Christ; it is therefore popularly dubbed &quot;Denmark&#x27;s baptismal certificate&quot; (&quot;Danmarks dåbsattest&quot;), an expression coined by art historian Rudolf Broby-Johansen in the 1930s. In 1997 a photo of this stone inspired the name Bluetooth for the now-ubiquitous wireless standard.


==Recent history==
After having been exposed to the elements for a thousand years, cracks were beginning to show. On 15 November 2008 experts from UNESCO examined the stones to determine their condition. Experts requested that the stones be moved to an indoor exhibition hall, or in some other way protected &quot;in situ&quot;, to prevent further damage from the weather.

In February 2011 the site was vandalized using green spray paint, with the word &quot;GELWANE&quot; written on both sides of the larger stone, and with identical graffiti sprayed on a nearby gravestone and on the church door. After much speculation about the possible meaning of the enigmatic word &quot;gelwane&quot;, the vandal was eventually discovered to be a 15-year-old boy with Asperger&#x27;s syndrome and the word itself was meaningless. As the paint had not fully hardened, experts were able to remove it.

The Heritage Agency of Denmark decided to keep the stones in their current location and selected a protective casing design from 157 projects submitted through a competition. The winner of the competition was Nobel Architects. The glass casing creates a climate system that keeps the stones at a fixed temperature and humidity and protects them from weathering. The design features rectangular glass casings strengthened by two solid bronze sides mounted on a supporting steel skeleton. The glass is coated with an anti-reflective material that gives the exhibit a greenish hue. Additionally, the bronze patina gives off a rusty, greenish colour, highlighting the runestones&#x27; grey and reddish tones and emphasising their monumental character and significance.

== Runestone of Harald Bluetooth ==
The inscription on the larger of the two Jelling stones (Jelling II, Rundata DR 42) reads:

* runes
* rune transliteration
* Old West Norse normalization
* Old East Norse normalization


The stone has a figure of the crucified Christ on one side and on another side a serpent wrapped around a lion. Christ is depicted as standing in the shape of a cross and entangled in what appear to be branches. This depiction of Christ has often been taken as indicating the parallels with the &quot;hanging&quot; of the Norse pagan god Odin, who in &quot;Rúnatal&quot; gives an account of being hanged from a tree and pierced by a spear.

=== Modern copies of the runestone of Harald Bluetooth ===
Another copy of this stone was placed in 1936 on the Domplein (&#x27;Dom Square&#x27;) in Utrecht in the Netherlands, next to the Cathedral of Utrecht, on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of Utrecht University.

In 1955, a plaster cast of this stone was made for a festival in London. It is now located in the grounds of the Danish Church in London, 4 St Katherines Precinct, Regents Park, London. The copy is painted in bright colours, like the original. Most of the original paint has flaked away from the original stone, but enough small specks of paint remained to enable the determination of what the colours looked like when they were freshly painted. A copy is also located in the National Museum of Denmark, and another copy, decorated by Rudolf Broby-Johansen in the 1930s, just outside the Jelling museum, which stands within sight of the Jelling mounds.

A copy exists in Rouen, Normandy, France, near Saint-Ouen Abbey Church, offered by Denmark to the city of Rouen, on the occasion of the millennium of Normandy in 1911.

A facsimile of the image of Christ on Harald&#x27;s runestone appears on the inside front cover of Danish passports.

== Runestone of Gorm ==
The inscription on the older and smaller of the Jelling stones (Jelling I, Rundata DR 41) reads:

* runes
* rune transliteration
* Old West Norse normalisation
* Old East Norse normalisation

<text>USS &quot;Boston&quot; (SSN-703), a , was the seventh ship of the United States Navy to be named for Boston, Massachusetts.

== History ==
The contract to build &quot;Boston&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 10 December 1973 and her keel was laid down on 11 August 1978. She was launched on 19 April 1980 sponsored by Mrs. Karen Dane Hidalgo (née Jernstedt), wife of the Secretary of the Navy Edward Hidalgo, and commissioned on 30 January 1982, with Captain Jon M. Barr in command.

In 1998 &quot;Boston&quot; participated in a UNITAS South America deployment.

== Decommissioning ==
Due to cutbacks in the Defense Budget; &quot;Boston&quot;, like many of her early &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class sisters was not given her mid-life nuclear refueling, and was decommissioned and stricken on 19 November 1999 from the Naval Vessel Register. Ex-&quot;Boston&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, on 1 October 2001 and on 19 September 2002 ceased to exist. Her sail and upper rudder were preserved for display at the Buffalo and Erie County Naval &amp; Military Park in Buffalo, New York.

== Awards ==
&quot;Boston&quot; was a much-decorated ship. The crew distinguished themselves on numerous occasions by meritorious service and outstanding performance. Awards included the Arleigh Burke Fleet Award and the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award, both of which are presented to one ship in the Pacific and one ship in the Atlantic. Her other awards included:

<text>Rene Goulaine de Laudonnière (; c. 1529–1574) was a French Huguenot explorer and the founder of the French colony of Fort Caroline in what is now Jacksonville, Florida. Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, a Huguenot, sent Jean Ribault and Laudonnière to explore potential sites in Florida suitable for settlement by the French Protestants.

==Biography==

Laudonnière was a Huguenot nobleman and merchant mariner from Poitou, France. His birthdate and family origins are currently unknown. One school of historians attaches him to a branch of the Goulaine family seated at Laudonnière, near Nantes. A competing claim insists that he was a Burdigale (or Bourdigalle) from the port town of Sables d&#x27;Olonne. No contemporary records have been published to substantiate either theory.

In 1562, Laudonnière was appointed second in command of the Huguenot expedition to Florida under Jean Ribault. Leaving in February 1562, the expedition returned home in July after establishing the small settlement of Charlesfort in present-day South Carolina.

After the French Wars of Religion broke out between French Catholics and Huguenots, Ribault fled France and sought refuge in England. Meanwhile, the Huguenots planned another expedition to Florida and Laudonnière was placed in command in Ribault&#x27;s absence. In 1564 Laudonniere received 50,000 crowns from Charles IX and returned to Florida with three ships and 300 Huguenot colonists.

Laudonnière arrived at the mouth of the May River (today called the St. Johns River) on 22 June 1564. He sailed up the river where he eventually founded Fort Caroline, which they named for King Charles, in what is now Jacksonville. He made contact with the Saturiwa, a Timucua chiefdom who were friendly to the colonists and showed them a shrine they had built around a monument left behind by Ribault. When some of the men complained about the manual labor, Laudonnière sent them back to France.

The colony did not flourish and had to get food from the Timucua. Colonists complained and a small group seized a ship and sailed to the Gulf of Mexico to become pirates. Deserters from the colony angered the Timucua, who refused to give any more food. Colonists had to rely on acorns and roots and finally rebelled.

On 3 August 1565 Laudonnière bought food and a ship from passing privateer John Hawkins so he could ship the colonists back to France. While he was waiting for a favorable wind, Jean Ribault arrived with 600 more settlers and soldiers on September 10. Ribault informed Laudonnière that he had been relieved of his authority, but offered him an informal co-regency over the colony. This arrangement was unacceptable to Laudonnière, who resolved to return to France.

Events interrupted Laudonnière&#x27;s departure when a Spanish fleet commanded by Adelantado Pedro Menéndez de Avilés appeared. Spain based her long-standing claim to Florida on the voyage of discovery of Juan Ponce de León in 1513, as well as four other expeditions of exploration. Menéndez, one of the foremost naval officers of his day, had been sent out by King Philip II of Spain with a fleet and 800 Spanish settlers with specific instructions to remove the French Protestants from Florida. Menéndez&#x27;s fleet attempted to grapple and board Ribault&#x27;s ships just off the mouth of the St. Johns River, but sea conditions denied success to both combatants. The Spanish admiral sailed south to the next deep inlet on the Atlantic Florida coast. Spanish troops disembarked on 28 August 1565 near the Timucua Indian village of Seloy and hastily threw up some field fortifications, anticipating a French attack. Ribault set sail southward on 10 September 1565, taking most of the soldiers with him to attack the newly established Spanish earthworks-and-palm-log camp at St Augustine. He left Laudonnière with 100 men but only 20 soldiers.
During a hurricane, Ménendez had sent Spanish troops marching north overland to attack Fort Caroline on 20 September. They overwhelmed the lightly defended Huguenot garrison and killed most of the male colonists, about 140; about 60 women and children were spared. Laudonnière and 40-50 others managed to escape. He made his way to the river&#x27;s mouth, where Ribault&#x27;s son was anchored with three ships. He set sail in the younger Ribault&#x27;s company but eventually headed home on a lone vessel, unexpectedly landing in Wales.

Meanwhile, Jean Ribault&#x27;s fleet ran into the same hurricane that had bedeviled the Spanish approach to Fort Caroline. The storm drove the French squadron many miles south toward present-day Daytona Beach, destroying all the warships. Ribault and hundreds of other survivors washed ashore, and began to walk north along the beach. At Matanzas Inlet, a Spanish patrol encountered the remnants of the French force, and took them prisoner. Following the king of Spain&#x27;s express edict, all heretics were taken behind a sand dune and put to the sword. The few confessing Catholics and the young musicians were spared their lives. Ribault was executed, along with about 350 of his men. By mid-October 1565, the military power of France on the Florida coast had been obliterated, in accord with the wishes of Philip II of Spain.

Traveling overland via Bristol and London, Laudonnière probably reached Paris in December 1565. After reporting to the royal Court at Moulins, Laudonnière faded from the historical picture. Several years later he emerged as a merchant mariner in 1572 at La Rochelle. He evaded the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre of Huguenots, and died at St. Germain-en-Laye in 1574. His memoirs, &quot;L&#x27;histoire notable de la Floride, contenant les trois voyages faits en icelles par des capitaines et pilotes français&quot;, were published in 1586.

<text>PC Bruno was a Polish–French–Spanish signals–intelligence station near Paris during World War II, from October 1939 until June 1940. Its function was decryption of cipher messages, most notably German messages enciphered on the Enigma machine. 

&quot;PC Bruno&quot; worked in close cooperation with Britain&#x27;s decryption center at Bletchley Park.

==History==
In the early 1930s, French military intelligence acquired operation manuals and sample messages for the German Enigma cipher machine. French intelligence officer Captain Gustave Bertrand supplied this material to Poland&#x27;s &quot;Biuro Szyfrów&quot; (&quot;Cipher Bureau&quot;), which used it as part of their successful effort to break Enigma.

In July 1939 the &quot;Biuro Szyfrów&quot; gave French and British intelligence all their results. Both countries were expanding their decryption efforts in anticipation of war, and this continued after the war started in September 1939.

When Poland was overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union, the key staff of the &quot;Biuro Szyfrów&quot; were evacuated to Romania, and from there eventually reached France. On 20 October 1939 the Poles resumed work, hosted by French intelligence at &quot;PC Bruno&quot;.

&quot;PC Bruno&quot; was located in the Château de Vignolles in Gretz-Armainvilliers, some 40 kilometres southeast of Paris. It was headed by now-Major Bertrand. Its personnel included 15 Poles, 50 Frenchmen, and 7 anti-fascist Spaniards who worked on Spanish and Italian ciphers. The Polish group was led by Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and included the mathematicians who had been breaking Enigma for nearly seven years since December 1932: Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Różycki, and Henryk Zygalski. The Spanish team (&quot;Equipo D&quot; – Team D) was led by Faustino A.V. Camazón, who was aware of the use of the Enigma machine by German forces during the Spanish Civil War. 

As late as 3–7 December 1939, when Lt. Col. Langer and French Air Force Capt. Henri Braquenié visited London and Bletchley Park, the British asked that the Polish cryptologists be made available to them in Britain. Langer, however, took the position that they must remain where the Polish army in exile was forming—on French soil.

Bletchley Park and &quot;PC Bruno&quot; worked together against the German message traffic. In the interest of security, they themselves corresponded using the supposedly &quot;unbreakable&quot; Enigma cipher. In early 1940, the two centres read some old Enigma messages, and in March they broke some German daily keys, and read some messages &quot;in real time&quot; (i.e., sometimes as soon as their intended German recipients). During the next few months, the two centres decrypted several thousand Enigma messages, about half at each centre. Some of the messages gave notice of the German invasion of Denmark and Norway and of the German invasions on Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. However, no effective Allied use was made of these warnings.

By June 1940, advancing German forces were approaching &quot;PC Bruno&quot;. Just after midnight on 10 June, Bertrand evacuated the &quot;Bruno&quot; staff from Gretz-Armainvillers. France surrendered on 22 June; on 24 June he flew the 15 Poles and seven Spaniards in three planes to Algeria.

In September 1940, Bertrand secretly returned them to France. He established a new decryption center at Uzès near the Mediterranean Sea coast, in the unoccupied &#x27;Free Zone&#x27; of France. This center, codenamed &quot;Cadix&quot;, resumed breaking ciphers. &quot;Cadix&quot; operated until the German occupation of southern France in November 1942.

One of the 20th century&#x27;s leading astronomers, he is widely regarded as the founder of theoretical astrophysics in the Soviet Union.

Educated at Leningrad State University (LSU) and the Pulkovo Observatory, Ambartsumian taught at LSU and founded the Soviet Union&#x27;s first department of astrophysics there in 1934. He subsequently moved to Soviet Armenia, where he founded the Byurakan Observatory in 1946. It became his institutional base for the decades to come and a major center of astronomical research. He also co-founded the Armenian Academy of Sciences and led it for almost half a century—the entire post-war period. One commentator noted that &quot;science in Armenia was synonymous with the name Ambartsumian.&quot; In 1965 Ambartsumian founded the journal &quot;Astrofizika&quot; and served as its editor for over 20 years.

Ambartsumian began retiring from the various positions he held only from the age of 80. He died at his house in Byurakan and was buried on the grounds of the observatory. He was awarded the title of National Hero of Armenia in 1994.

==Background==
Ambartsumian was born in Tiflis on , to Armenian parents Hripsime Khakhanian (1885–1972) and Hamazasp Hambardzumyan (1880–1966). Hripsime&#x27;s father was an Armenian Apostolic priest from Tskhinvali, while Hamazasp hailed from Vardenis (Basargechar). His ancestors had moved from Diyadin, what is now Turkey, to the southern shores of Lake Sevan in 1830, in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War. Hamazasp was an educated man of letters who studied law at Saint Petersburg University. He was also a writer and translator and notably translated Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; into Armenian from Classical Greek. In 1912 he co-founded the Caucasian Society of Armenian Writers, which lasted until 1921. Ambartsumian was the secretary, while Hovhannes Tumanyan, the famed poet, served as its president. Ambartsumian knew Tumanyan personally. In 1922, after the 14-year-old boy described Sirius to him, Tumanyan wrote a short poem about the star.

Ambartsumian&#x27;s parents married in 1904. He had a brother, Levon, and sister, Gohar. Levon, a geophysics student, died at 23-24 while on an expedition in the Urals. Gohar (1907–1979) was a mathematician and Chair of Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics at Yerevan State University towards the end of her life.

==Education==
Ambartsumian developed an early interest in mathematics and was able to multiply by the age of 4. His interest in astronomy began with reading a Russian translation of a book by Ormsby M. Mitchel at 11. By his own account, he considered himself an astronomer by the age of 12. Between 1917 and 1924 he studied at Tiflis gymnasiums #3 and #4 where schooling was done in both Russian and Armenian. In 1921 he transferred to gymnasium #4 to study under Nikolay Ignatievich Sudakov, a Moscow-educated astronomer, whom Ambartsumian called a &quot;very serious teacher of astronomy.&quot; Ambartsumian worked with Sudakov at the school observatory the latter had built. At school, Ambartsumian wrote several papers on astronomy and delivered lectures on the origin of the Solar System and extraterrestrial life at &quot;first in school and then in the various clubs and houses of culture&quot; beginning at 12–13. In 1924 Ambartsumian delivered a lecture at Yerevan State University about the theory of relativity. He also met Ashot Hovhannisyan and Alexander Miasnikian, Armenia&#x27;s communist leaders.

In 1924 Ambartsumian moved to Leningrad, where he began attending the Herzen Pedagogical Institute. Shakhbazyan suggests that his non-peasant, non-proletarian background prevented him from entering Leningrad State University (LSU). However, Ambartsumian explained in an interview that by the time he arrived in August, LSU&#x27;s admissions were already closed. To avoid losing a year, he opted to study in the physics and mathematics department of the pedagogical institute. After one year, he transferred to LSU&#x27;s physics and mathematics department. At university, Ambartsumian was interested in both astronomy and mathematics. &quot;I loved mathematics, but at the same time I felt that my profession would be astronomy. Mathematics was like a hobby, but I did complete the full mathematics curriculum. Thus you could say that I graduated with a major in mathematics, but in fact it is recorded that I graduated as an astronomer,&quot; he said in an interview in 1987. At LSU among his professors were the physicist Orest Khvolson and mathematician Vladimir Smirnov. He studied alongside other major Soviet scientists such as Lev Landau, Sergei Sobolev, Sergey Khristianovich and George Gamow. In 1926 he published the first of his 16 scholarly papers as a student. He graduated in 1928, although he received his diploma only fifty years later—in 1978. His undergraduate thesis was &quot;devoted to a study of radiative transfer radiative equilibrium.&quot; He completed his postgraduate studies at the Pulkovo Observatory under Aristarkh Belopolsky between 1928 and 1931.

==Career==

=== Leningrad ===
After completing his postgraduate studies in 1931, Ambartsumian began working at the Pulkovo Observatory and teaching part-time at LSU. In 1931 Ambartsumian began reading the first course on theoretical astrophysics in the Soviet Union. He also served as Pulkovo&#x27;s scientific secretary in 1931–32, which involved mostly administrative work. Ambartsumian later characterized Pulkovo as being a &quot;very old institution, and for this reason there were certain elements of ossification and stagnation. Nevertheless, this was the best qualified astronomical institution in the Soviet Union.&quot;

In 1934 Ambartsumian was fired by Pulkovo director Boris Gerasimovich for alleged &quot;laziness.&quot; Gerasimovich viewed Ambartsumian and other young astrophysicists as &quot;undisciplined and in too much of a rush to publish untested theories and poorly documented research.&quot; Gerasimovich himself had a &quot;tendency to non-cooperativeness.&quot; Gerasimovich was not taken seriously by them. When in 1934 Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar visited Leningrad, he was told by Ambartsumian, &quot;Look here, here is a set of papers by Gerasimovich. I turn to an arbitrary paper and to an arbitrary line. I am sure you will find a mistake.&quot; Chandrasekhar stated in 1977 that during his visit in 1934 Ambartsumian &quot;was very free and very open. He was extremely critical of his seniors.&quot;

After leaving Pulkovo, Ambartsumian founded the first department of astrophysics in the Soviet Union at Leningrad State University in 1934. In 1934 he was named professor at LSU and in 1935 he was named doctor of physical-mathematical sciences without having to defend a thesis &quot;based on his scientific work through that date.&quot; He headed the department until 1946 or 1947.

Between 1939 and 1941 Ambartsumian was the director of the Astronomical Observatory of LSU. He was simultaneously prorector (deputy president) of the university. Among his graduate students were Viktor Sobolev, Benjamin Markarian, Grigor Gurzadyan, and others. Ambartsumian considered Sobolev his &quot;most brilliant graduate student.&quot;

;Stalin&#x27;s purges
Many of Ambartsumian&#x27;s colleagues and friends suffered during the Great Purge under Stalin, most notably Nikolai Aleksandrovich Kozyrev (1908–83), with whom he became close friends in the mid-1920s. Kozyrev was sentenced to ten years in a forced-labor camp, but survived the repressions. Others such as Matvei Petrovich Bronstein and Pulkovo director Boris Gerasimovich did not survive. Ambartsumian&#x27;s relations with Kozyrev were &quot;strained for the remainder of his life.&quot; McCutcheon notes that while in the West some have questioned Ambartsumian&#x27;s possible role in the terror, &quot;there is no hard evidence to suggest that he was guilty of anything more serious than surviving at a time when others did not.&quot;

;World War II
Ambartsumian led the evacuation of part of the faculty of Leningrad State University to Elabuga, Tatarstan in 1941, after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. There a branch of LSU operated under Ambartsumian&#x27;s leadership until 1944. He served as the dean of the branch.

===Armenia===
In 1943 Ambartsumian moved with his family to Yerevan, Soviet Armenia, where he lived until the end of his life. In the same year, he co-founded the Armenian Academy of Sciences along with scientists and scholars Hovsep Orbeli, Hrachia Acharian, Artem Alikhanian, Abram Alikhanov, Manuk Abeghian and others. He served as vice president of the academy until 1947 and as president from 1947 to 1993.

Since 1943 Ambartsumian served as director of the Yerevan Astronomical Observatory. The small observatory was affiliated with Yerevan State University. Ambartsumian had secured a nine-inch telescope from Leningrad for the observatory. Ambartsumian said that before the war &quot;this observatory did not rise significantly above the level of amateur variable star observations. During the war they also carried out photographic observations of variable stars using a small camera.&quot; In 1945–1946 Ambartsumian founded the department of astrophysics at Yerevan State University (YSU). He was named professor of astrophysics at YSU in 1947. He served as chair of the department until 1994.

In 1965 Ambartsumian founded the journal &quot;Astrofizika&quot; (Armenian: Աստղաֆիզիկա, Russian: Астрофизика), which has been published by the Armenian Academy of Sciences since then. It was originally published in Russian, subsequently articles in English began to appear. He served as its editor-in-chief until 1987. The journal has also been published since the first issue in English by Springer in the US as &quot;Astrophysics&quot;.

====Byurakan====

In 1946 Ambartsumian founded the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory in the village of Byurakan, at an altittude of , on the slopes of Mount Aragats, some from Yerevan. The first buildings were completed in 1951, though the official inauguration took place in 1956. Observations began to be carried out simultaneous with the construction of the observatory. &quot;Our instruments stood under the open sky, covered with tarpaulin,&quot; said Ambartsumian. Ambartsumian initially lived at a house in the village of Byurakan then build a house within the observatory grounds with the money awarded with the 1950 Stalin Prize. Ambartsumian directed the Byurakan Observatory until 1988 and was named its honorary director that year. From 1946 until his death in 1996, the Byurakan Observatory served as Ambartsumian&#x27;s &quot;institutional base.&quot;

In 1960 Ambartsumian secured a Schmidt telescope with 40І (102 cm) correcting plate and 52І (132 cm) mirror for Byurakan. The telescope was reportedly made by Carl Zeiss AG in Nazi Germany in the 1930s and was transferred to Leningrad as spoils of war. It was completed in Leningrad and sent to Armenia. Beginning with 1965, on Ambartsumian&#x27;s initiative, Benjamin Markarian started the First Byurakan Survey that resulted in the discovery of the Markarian galaxies. A number of international symposiums and meetings were held at Byurakan under Ambartsumian&#x27;s supervision. In 1968 the observatory was awarded the Order of Lenin, the Soviet Union&#x27;s highest civilian order for its great merit to the development of science. In 1961 Ambartsumian supervised the establishment of an astrophysical station of Leningrad State University, his alma mater, within the grounds of the Byurakan Observatory. It is where graduate students of the LSU did their summer internships until the late 1980s. It was shut down in 1993.

Ambartsumian and his disciples at the Byurakan Observatory became known in the scholarly literature as the &quot;Byurakan School.&quot; From 1977 to 1996 Ambartsumian headed a specialized council for theses defenses at Byurakan. Over 50 scientists defended their PhD (Candidate) and Doctoral theses on astronomy, astrophysics and theoretical physics in those years under Ambartsumian. Though most of the students were graduates of the astrophysics department of Yerevan State University, many came from Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Hungary, Bulgaria, and elsewhere. Several symposiums of the International Astronomical Union and numerous conferences were held in Byurakan in attendance of Jan Oort, Fritz Zwicky, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Pyotr Kapitsa, Vitaly Ginzburg, and others. It was also visited by Soviet leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev.

With the Byurakan Observatory, Ambartsumian &quot;put Armenia on the astronomical map&quot; and made Soviet Armenia &quot;one of the world&#x27;s centers for the study of astrophysics.&quot; By the time of his death in 1996, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Byurakan as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s leading astronomical research centers.&quot; As of 1960 the Byurakan Observatory maintained regular contact with 350 research institutions and with scientists from 50 countries.

==Research==
Ambartsumian carried out basic research in astronomy and cosmogony. It covered astrophysics, theoretical physics and mathematical physics, and mostly focused on the physics of nebulae, star systems, and extragalactic astronomy. He is best known for having discovered stellar associations and predicted activity of galactic nuclei. In his later career, Ambartsumian held views in contradiction to the consequences of the general relativity, such as rejecting the existence of black holes.

===Stellar associations===
In 1947 Ambartsumian discovered stellar associations, a new type of stellar system, which led to the conclusion that star formation continues to take place in the Milky Way galaxy. At the time the &quot;idea of star formation as an ongoing process was regarded as very speculative.&quot; His discovery was announced in a short publication by the Armenian Academy Sciences. Ambartsumian&#x27;s discovery was based on his observation of stars of O and B spectral types and T Tauri and flare stars that cluster very loosely. This is significantly different from open clusters, which have a higher density of stars, while stellar associations have lower than average density. Ambartsumian divided stellar associations into OB and T groups and concluded that the &quot;associations have to be dynamically unstable configurations, and must expand subsequently, dissolving to form field stars.&quot; He thus argued that star forming is ongoing in the galaxy and that stars are born explosively and in groups.

Ambartsumian&#x27;s concept was not immediately accepted. Chandrasekhar noted the &quot;early scepticism with which this discovery was received by the astronomers of the &#x27;establishment&#x27; when I first gave an account of [Ambartsumian&#x27;s] paper at the colloquium at the Yerkes Observatory in late 1950.&quot; Chandrasekhar noted that Ambartsumian&#x27;s discovery of stellar associations had &quot;far-reaching implications for subsequent theories relating to star formation.&quot; McCutcheon noted that the discovery &quot;opened an entirely new field of astrophysical research.&quot;

===Active galactic nuclei (AGN)===
Ambartsumian began studying nuclei of galaxies in the mid-1950s. He found that clusters of galaxies are unstable and that galaxy formation is still ongoing. At the 1958 Solvay Conference on Physics in Brussels he gave a famous report in which he emphasized the extraordinary character of the activity of galactic nuclei (AGN). He claimed &quot;enormous explosions take place in galactic nuclei and as a result a huge amount of mass is expelled. In addition, if this is so, these galactic nuclei must contain bodies of huge mass and unknown nature.&quot; Lynden-Bell and Gurzadyan note that Ambartsumian was &quot;perhaps the first to emphasize explosive phenomena in galactic nuclei.&quot; Evidence for the activity included the Markarian galaxies, discovered at Byurakan. The concept of AGN was widely accepted some years later, especially after quasars were discovered in 1963. Ambartsumian developed and summarized his views on activity of galaxies in the 1960s.

===Radiative transfer===
Ambartsumian discovered basic results in radiative transfer in astronomy. He was the first or one of the first to study stellar radiation transfer in gaseous nebulae. He devised techniques for calculating the rates of star cluster decay and the time needed to reach statistical equilibrium in double star systems.

In 1943 he introduced the principle of invariance, a method introduced by Ambartsumian in a theory of radiation transfer. Lynden-Bell and Gurzadyan describe it as the &quot;law that diffuse reflection by a semi-infinite, plane-parallel atmosphere must be invariant to the addition or subtraction of layers of arbitrary thickness to the atmosphere.&quot; It has been applied in other areas, including optics, mathematical physics, radiophysics, geophysics, oceanology, &quot;allowing people to handle easily very complex mathematical problems.&quot; It was further developed by Chandrasekhar in his &quot;Radiative Transfer&quot; (1950). According to Chandrasekhar, the formulation of the principles of invariance in the theory of radiative transfer is a &quot;theoretical innovation that is of the greatest significance.&quot; He admitted that Ambartsumian&#x27;s ideas influenced his own.

===Astronomy from space===
Ambartsumian was a &quot;pioneer of astronomical research from Soviet spacecraft.&quot; The program was directed by his disciple Grigor Gurzadyan and was launched in 1961. In April 1971 the Salyut 1 space station carried Orion 1, the &quot;first space telescope with an objective prism, into orbit.&quot; In December 1973 the crewed Soyuz 13 mission operated the &quot;Orion-2 ultraviolet Cassegrain telescope with a quartz objective prism built in the Byurakan Observatory. Spectra of thousands of stars to as faint as thirteenth magnitude were obtained, as was the first satellite ultraviolet spectrogram of a planetary nebula, revealing lines of aluminium and titanium-elements not previously observed in planetary nebulae.&quot;

These activities, especially the space missions, when for example a special crewed spaceship had to be devoted to an experiment from the smallest Soviet republic, needed powerful backing, both in Kremlin corridors and within the top-secret rocket industry establishment. This was achieved due to Ambartsumian&#x27;s political skills, with the active support of Mstislav Keldish, the then President of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.

===Mathematics===
Ambartsumian also made contributions to mathematics, most notably with his 1929 paper in &quot;Zeitschrift für Physik&quot;. In it, Ambartsumian first introduced the inverse Sturm-Liouville problem. He proved that &quot;among all vibrating strings only the homogeneous vibrating string has eigenvalues that are specific to it—that is, homogeneous vibrating strings have a spectrum of eigenvalues.&quot; It was only in the mid-1940s when his paper received attention and became a &quot;significant research topic in the ensuing decades.&quot; He commented: &quot;when an astronomer is publishing a mathematical paper in a physical journal, he cannot expect to attract too many readers.&quot;

Ambartsumian had made an independent discovery of Radon&#x27;s problem in 1936. He did so in a three dimensional velocity space rather than ordinary space and gave the solution in two and three dimensions. Allan MacLeod Cormack, the 1979 Nobel Prize Laureate in Physiology or Medicine for his work on X-ray computed tomography, noted that it is the &quot;first numerical inversion of the Radon transform&quot; and suggested that it disproves the &quot;often made statement that computed tomography would be impossible without computers.&quot; Ambartsumian&#x27;s calculations, Cormack argued, &quot;suggest that even in 1936 computed tomography might have been able to make significant contributions to, say, the diagnosis of tumors in the head.&quot; Ambartsumian told Cormack that he was informed of Radon&#x27;s results two years after he published his work.

==Science administration==
===Soviet Academy of Sciences===
Ambartsumian was elected corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1939 and full member (academician) in 1953. In 1955 he became a member of the academy&#x27;s presidium, the governing body. He also chaired the Academy&#x27;s Joint Coordinating Scientific Council on astronomy, which was responsible for the priorities and all major decisions in all of astronomy. He was also chairman of the academy&#x27;s commissions on astronomy (1944–46) and cosmogony (1952–64).

In these positions, Ambartsumian was &quot;one of the most powerful scientists of his time.&quot; McCutcheon noted that Ambartsumian&#x27;s &quot;towering authority as an astrophysicist combined with his position in the Soviet establishment made him arguably the most powerful Soviet astronomer of his day.&quot; He was often the &quot;official head of Soviet delegations at many conferences, not only on astronomy but also on natural philosophy.&quot;

From 1944 to 1979 Ambartsumian was a member of the editorial board of &quot;Astronomicheskii zhurnal&quot; (also known as &quot;Astronomy Reports&quot;), the Soviet Union&#x27;s main astronomy journal. He was also on the editorial board of &quot;Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR&quot; (&quot;Proceedings of the USSR Academy of Sciences&quot;).

===Armenian Academy of Sciences===
Although the Armenian branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences was established in 1935, it was not until 1943 that the National Academy of Sciences of the Armenian SSR was found. Ambartsumian was one of its original co-founders along with other prominent scholars and scientists, including Hovsep Orbeli, who became its first president. Ambartsumian initially served as vice president and in 1947 he became the academy&#x27;s second president, serving for 46 years until 1993. When he stepped down, Ambartsumian was declared honorary president of the academy.

Rouben Paul Adalian wrote that Ambartsumian &quot;exercised enormous influence in the advancement of science in Soviet Armenia, and was revered as his country&#x27;s leading scientist.&quot; McCutcheon went on to note that &quot;From that point forward, science in Armenia was synonymous with the name Ambartsumian.&quot; As president of the principal coordinating body for scientific research in Soviet Armenia, Ambartsumian played a significant role in promoting the sciences in the country. He actively promoted the natural and exact sciences, including physics and mathematics, radioelectronics, chemistry, mechanics and engineering. Artashes Shahinian noted that Ambartsumian played a significant role in the development of the physical and mathematical sciences. He played an instrumental role in the establishment and development of the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines (YerNIIMM) in 1956, popularly known as the &quot;Mergelyan Institute&quot; after its first director, mathematician Sergey Mergelyan. Apoyan rejects that Ambartsumian had a direct involvement in its creation and characterizes his role as &quot;favorable neutrality.&quot; Overall, Apoyan criticizes Ambartsumian&#x27;s role in science administration, arguing that he had a tendency to &quot;fail projects that did not directly serve his fame.&quot; He went as far as call Ambartsumian a &quot;tyrant.&quot;

Ambartsumian and Mergelyan had a complicated relationship. In 1971 Ambartsumian persuaded him to return to Armenia from Moscow and become vice president of the Armenian Academy of Sciences. However, in 1974 Mergelyan was not reelected to the presidium of the academy and was forced to leave it. Some academicians called for a revote, but Ambartsumian rejected any such attempts. Oganjanyan and Silantiev note that Ambartsumian was rumored to have seen Mergelyan as a rival for the academy&#x27;s president and decided to &quot;get rid of the competitor forever.&quot;

Ambartsumian was the Chairman of the Editorial Board of the &quot;Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia&quot;, published in 13 volumes in 1974–87.

===International===
According to Jean-Claude Pecker Ambartsumian &quot;had a very strong influence on world astropolitics&quot; and is one of the few astronomers who have had such a &quot;deep influence on the life of the international bodies devoted to the promotion and defense of astronomy and science in general.&quot;

;International Astronomical Union
Ambartsumian was a member of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) since 1946. He served as vice-president of the IAU from 1948 to 1955, then as president from 1961 to 1964. As Vice President Ambartsumian attempted to have the IAU General Assembly be held in Leningrad in 1951, however, the IAU Executive Committee canceled the assembly, increasing tensions within the IAU. An IAU General Assembly eventually took place in Moscow in 1958. Ambartsumian headed the organizing committee. Blaauw noted that &quot;During these years, Ambartsumian, although violently opposing the IAU&#x27;s policy, remained loyal to the Executive Committee&#x27;s majority decisions for the sake of safeguarding international collaboration, an attitude that contributed to his election as President of the IAU in 1961.&quot; He continued to support it as &quot;the world-wide organization embracing astronomers from all countries. His election as President of the IAU in 1961 reflected both the appreciation for his efforts in this respect and his outstanding scientific achievements.&quot;

Ambartsumian was outspoken about the importance of international cooperation. At the 1952 IAU General Assembly in Rome he declared: &quot;We believe that the joint study of such large problems as that of the evolution of celestial bodies will contribute to the cultural rapprochement of different nations, and to a better understanding among them. This is our modest contribution to the noble efforts toward maintaining peace throughout the world.&quot; At the 1963 IAU symposium in Sydney he stated that while competition between nations is important, it should be associated with co-operation.

;International Council of Scientific Unions
Ambartsumian also served as president of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) between 1968 and 1972, being elected twice for two-year terms in 1968 and 1970. He was the first individual from the Eastern bloc to be elected to that post.

==Philosophical and cosmological views==
Ambartsumian made &quot;philosophical excursions&quot;, and published several books and articles on philosophy, including &quot;Philosophical Questions About the Science of the Universe&quot; (1973). In a 1968 paper Ambartsumian wrote that he believes in a close collaboration of philosophy and the natural sciences to solve the main scientific problems about nature. Ambartsumian became a member of the administration of the Philosophical Society of the Soviet Union when it was established in 1971. In 1990 he became honorary president of the Philosophical Society of Armenia, which was created through his efforts.

===Science and religion===

Ambartsumian was an atheist and believed that science and religion are irreconcilable. Ambartsumian wrote in 1959 that the &quot;idea of the existence of God, the idea of world-creation has been defeated entirely.&quot; In an interview months before his death, Ambartsumian said that &quot;God is an idea [...] the embodiment of morality [...] an idea that gives meaning to life, profound meaning, and thus, it must be acknowledged that it exists.&quot;

For over four decades,{{efn|The organization effectively ceased to operate during the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1990, when the last of its publications were made.}} he headed &quot;Gitelik&quot;, the Armenian branch of the all-Soviet organization &quot;Znaniye&quot; (Knowledge), founded in 1947 to continue the pre-war atheist work of the League of Militant Godless. The organization engaged in what it called &quot;scientific-atheistic propaganda&quot; by publishing atheist novels and journals, producing films and organizing lectures on the supremacy of science over religion. As of 1986, the society had around 20,000 members.

According to one associate, Ambartsumian self-identified as an &quot;Armenian Christian&quot; but was not religious.{{sfn|Parsamian|2008|p=344}} He felt that Christianity has been important in preserving Armenian identity.{{sfn|Shakhbazyan|2011|p=287}} Ambartsumian had friendly relations with Vazgen I, the long-time head (Catholicos) of the Armenian Apostolic Church, especially since at least the late 1980s.{{efn|In 1988 Vazgen I publicly congratulated Ambartsumian&#x27;s 80th anniversary in 1988.{{sfn|Parsamian|2008|p=435}} Ambartsumian and the four other prominent Armenians hunger striking in Moscow sent a letter to Vazgen I on his birthday on 20 September 1990 expressing their admiration for him. &quot;Your holy faith and your sublime example of selflessly serving the nation give us strength and endurance,&quot; read the statement. Vazgen I was made honorary member of the Ambartsumian-led Armenian Academy of Sciences in 1991.}} In 1969 Ambartsumian visited San Lazzaro degli Armeni in Venice, home of the Armenian Catholic congregation of the Mekhitarists and was declared an honorary member of its academy.{{sfn|Parsamian|2008|p=377}}

===Marxism–Leninism and dialectical materialism===
Ambartsumian accepted and followed Marxist-Leninist philosophy and staunchly promoted dialectical materialism and projected it on his astrophysical interpretations. Helge Kragh described Ambartsumian as a &quot;convinced Marxist.&quot; He wrote on Marxism–Leninism and dialectical materialism in 1959:{{sfn|Graham|1987|pp=391-392}}{{efn|Also cited in}}
{{Quote frame|The history of the development of human knowledge, each step forward in science and technology, each new scientific discovery, irrefutably attests to the truth and fruitfulness of dialectical materialism, affirms the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist teaching concerning the knowability of the world, the magnitude and transforming power of the human mind, which is penetrating ever deeper into the secrets of nature. At the same time the achievements of science convincingly demonstrate the complete unsoundness of idealism and agnosticism, and the reactionariness of the religious world view.}}

Dialectical materialism influenced Ambartsumian&#x27;s cosmological views and ideas. According to Loren Graham, &quot;perhaps no great Soviet scientist has made more outspoken statements in favor of dialectical materialism&quot; than Ambartsumian.{{sfn|Graham|1987|p=391}} Mark H. Teeter wrote in a 1981 report that Ambartsumian is &quot;one of a rather limited group of Soviet scholars of international stature who claim that dialectical materialism has assisted them in their work.&quot; Kragh noted that Ambartsumian was not a cosmologist, but an astrophysicist, and that &quot;his ideas of the universe were influenced both by his background in astrophysics and his adherence to Marxist–Leninist philosophy.&quot; Graham notes that his &quot;praise of dialectical materialism has been voiced again and again over the years; these affirmations have come when political controls were rather lax as well as when they were tight. We have every reason to believe that they reflect, at root, his own approach to nature.&quot;{{sfn|Graham|1987|p=391}}

==Political career and views==
Ambartsumian is often referred to as a politician; Donald Lynden-Bell called him a skillful one. In a 1977 interview Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar went as far as to opine that Ambartsumian has been &quot;much more of a politician than an astronomer&quot; since the mid-1940s.

{{Ill|Ludvig Mirzoyan|hy|Լյուդվիկ Միրզոյան}}, a colleague and friend, wrote that &quot;Ambartsumian was a true patriot of his native land, Soviet Armenia and all the Soviet Union, and simultaneously, he was a convinced internationalist.&quot;{{sfn|Parsamian|2008|p=96}} He was described by a Soviet-run magazine as an &quot;ardent advocate of the widest possible international scientific exchange.&quot;

===Soviet politics===
McCutcheon noted that Ambartsumian&#x27;s life was &quot;shaped and directed by the Soviet system&quot; and he was politically loyal to the Soviet regime. Adriaan Blaauw wrote that &quot;his political views harmonized to a considerable degree with those of Soviet rulers.&quot; Loren Graham argued that, simultaneously, he was &quot;not afraid to reprimand the Communist Party ideologues when they obstructed his research.&quot;{{sfn|Graham|1987|p=392}} In favor with the Communist Party, he enjoyed the freedom to regularly travel to the West. McCutcheon noted that Ambartsumian&#x27;s &quot;scientific genius combined with his political loyalty took him to the heights of the Soviet scientific establishment.&quot;

Ambartsumian jointed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1940. In 1948 he became a member of the Central Committee (the executive branch) of the Communist Party of the Armenian SSR. Ambartsumian was also a member of the Supreme Soviet from 1950 to 1989 (3rd to 11th convocation sessions).{{sfn|Parsamian|2008|p=96}} In 1989 he was elected as a representative from Armenia to the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of the Soviet Union in the first relatively free elections.

Ambartsumian was a delegate to the 19th (1952), 20th (1956), 22nd (1961), 23rd (1966), 24th (1971), 25th (1976) and 26th (1981) congresses of the CPSU.{{sfn|Parsamian|2008|p=96}}

===Cold War politics===
Ambartsumian often signed open letters in support of the official line of the Soviet authorities. In 1971 he was among leading 14 Soviet scientists who signed a letter to U.S. President Richard Nixon in support of Angela Davis and appealed him to &quot;give her an opportunity of continuing her scientific work.&quot; In 1983 Ambartsumian was among 244 Soviet scientists who signed a statement attacking U.S. President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative (&quot;Star Wars&quot;), namely Reagan&#x27;s plan for an effective defense against nuclear attack. The scientists stated that Reagan is &quot;creating a most dangerous illusion that may turn into an even more threatening spiral of the arms race.&quot;

Ambartsumian&#x27;s relationship with dissidents was complicated. In 1973 he refused to meet Yuri Orlov, nuclear physicist and a prominent dissident, after having offered him a job in Yerevan. Ambartsumian told him through subordinate that &quot;there are situations when even an Academy member is helpless.&quot; In 1975 he was among 72 Soviet scientists who denounced the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov.

===Armenian causes===
Ambartsumian revered the Armenian language and supported its usage.{{sfn|Brutian|2008|p=105}} He insisted all internal communication of the Armenian Academy of Sciences be done in Armenian when he became president in 1947.{{sfn|Brutian|2008|p=105}} As president of the Armenian Academy of Sciences, Ambartsumian often gave speeches at major events, such as during the commemorations of the 1600th anniversary of Mesrop Mashtots, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet, in 1962 and the 100th anniversary of Hovhannes Tumanyan, Armenia&#x27;s national poet, in 1969. Ambartsumian stated: &quot;The history of our culture has given many outstanding figures, but of all these figures, the Armenian people owe the most to Mashtots.&quot; 

====Armenian genocide====
Ambartsumian delivered a speech on 24 April 1965, on the 50th anniversary of the Armenian genocide, describing it as &quot;extermination of the Armenian population of Western Armenia.&quot; He linked it to the 45th anniversary of Soviet Armenia and the revival of the Armenian people as a result of the October Revolution. In an article published in &quot;Pravda&quot; on 24 April 1975 Ambartsumian linked the Armenian genocide to the Holocaust and blamed German imperialism during World War I for inspiring the Young Turks and the capitalist states for failing to defend the innocent Armenian population and praised the October Revolution for saving the Armenian nation.

====Nagorno-Karabakh====
Ambartsumian played a role in the Karabakh movement and was vocal in the initial phase of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. In November 1989, the Ambartsumian-led Armenian Academy of Sciences issued a statement protesting the decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to return Nagorno-Karabakh under the direct control of Soviet Azerbaijan.

In September 1990 Ambartsumian and four other Armenians, including writer Zori Balayan and actor Sos Sargsyan, went on a hunger strike at the Hotel Moskva in Moscow to protest the military rule over Nagorno-Karabakh declared by Mikhail Gorbachev. Ambartsumian celebrated his 82nd birthday hunger striking. He insisted that Gorbachev had violated the Soviet constitution by keeping Nagorno-Karabakh under direct rule from Moscow. &quot;This is a bad thing when a government does not abide by its own laws,&quot; he argued. He also stated: &quot;My desire is that Karabakh be part of Armenia. This is a problem that has to be solved with a long process and with concessions.&quot; Ambartsumian stated that his only demand is that the &quot;elected leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh regain control.&quot; Ambartsumian called the hunger strike a &quot;modest step&quot; aimed at making a &quot;huge resonance in the world—to let the world know.&quot; The Soviet authorities &quot;totally ignored&quot; the strike.{{sfn|Lynden-Bell|Gurzadyan|1998|p=32}} He ended it after 9 days only when Catholicos Vazgen I persuaded him to do so.{{sfn|Shakhbazyan|2011|p=284}}{{sfn|Brutian|2008|p=105}}{{sfn|Lynden-Bell|Gurzadyan|1998|p=32}}

On 11 May 1991 Ambartsumian and a number of members of the Armenian Academy of Sciences wrote a letter to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev expressing their concern with the forced expulsion of ethnic Armenians from parts of NKAO and Shahumian rayon as part of Operation Ring.

=== Soviet collapse and independence of Armenia ===
In June 1991 the session of the Armenian Academy of Sciences issued a statement on its views on Armenian independence and the future of the Soviet Union. The Academy stated its unconditional support for the independence of Armenia, pushed at the time by the Pan-Armenian National Movement (HHSh). However, it argued that because Armenia is economically interconnected with and dependent on other Soviet republics, an abrupt disruption in the existing relations would result in &quot;unimaginable levels of economic collapse, unemployment and emigration.&quot; Thus, they called for Armenia to join the New Union Treaty proposed by Gorbachev. The session also argued that leaving the Soviet Union would mean to abandon Nagorno-Karabakh.

As a communist, Ambartsumian reportedly regretted the collapse of the Soviet Union, but voted for Armenia&#x27;s independence in the 1991 referendum. He appreciated independent Armenia, but reminded Armenians that they will be paying a high price for it.{{sfn|Shakhbazyan|2011|pp=283-284}} In 1995 he congratulated Armenians worldwide with Armenia&#x27;s independence and stated that the newly independent republic is &quot;moving forward.&quot; According to Yuri Shahbazyan, a friend and biographer of Ambartsumian, he remained sympathetic towards the Communist Party of Russia and was critical of Western-sponsored economic liberalization in Russia and other post-Soviet countries.{{sfn|Shakhbazyan|2011|p=285}}

==Personal life==

When Ambartsumian was referred to by foreigners as a Russian scientist, he corrected them by saying he was Armenian. He spoke perfect Armenian, albeit with an accent.

Between 1946 and 1996 Ambartsumian mostly divided his time between Yerevan and Byurakan. He built himself a house within the Byurakan Observatory with the award money that came with his second Stalin Prize in 1950.{{sfn|Brutian|2008|p=102}} Since 1960 he also maintained a house next to the building of the Academy of Sciences in Yerevan, on Baghramyan Avenue.

===Personality===
Donald Lynden-Bell characterized Ambartsumian as a &quot;broad-shouldered thickset man of medium height, quick intellect and strong character.&quot; Lynden-Bell and Vahe Gurzadyan wrote that Ambartsumian was modest in private life and behaved simply in public.{{sfn|Lynden-Bell|Gurzadyan|1998|p=32}} Fadey Sargsyan described Ambartsumian as an &quot;extremely modest&quot; man.{{sfn|Parsamian|2008|p=195}} Anthony Astrachan wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that Ambartsumian is &quot;by all reports an engaging human being.&quot; Ambartsumian admitted to not having any hobbies: &quot;My only passion is science, astronomy. Like a jealous wife, it expects a man to give all of himself.&quot; However, he loved poetry and music, and &quot;could enliven even the most abstract mathematical lectures with quotations from classical and contemporary poets.&quot;

===Family===
In 1930 or 1931 Ambartsumian married Vera Fyodorovna (née Klochikhina), an ethnic Russian, who was the niece and the adopted daughter of Pelageya Shajn, the wife of Grigory Shajn, both Russian astronomers.{{sfn|Shakhbazyan|2011|pp=148-149}}{{sfn|Brutian|2008|p=103}}{{sfn|Lynden-Bell|Gurzadyan|1998|p=26}} She was an English teacher who taught him to read his papers in English when he visited the U.S. and Britain. However, she could not reconcile with his &quot;barbarous pronunciation,&quot; as she described it. He was deeply depressed by her death in 1995.{{sfn|Lynden-Bell|Gurzadyan|1998|p=32}} They had four children: daughters Karine (b. 1933) and Yelena (b. 1936) and sons Rafayel (b. 1940) and Rouben (b. 1941). All four became either mathematicians or physicists.{{sfn|Shakhbazyan|2011|pp=148-149}} As of 1987 he had eight grandchildren.

===Retirement and death===
Ambartsumian began retiring from the various positions he held in 1988, at 80. He left the position of the director of the Byurakan Observatory that year. In 1993 he stepped down as president of the Armenian Academy of Sciences and in 1994 as chair of astrophysics at Yerevan State University.

Ambartsumian died at his Byurakan house on August 12, 1996, a month short of his 88th birthday. He was buried at the observatory grounds, next to his wife and parents.{{sfn|Shakhbazyan|2011|p=292}} His funeral was attended by thousands of people, including Armenia&#x27;s president Levon Ter-Petrosyan.{{sfn|Lynden-Bell|Gurzadyan|1998|p=32}}

His house was inaugurated as a museum in August 1998.

==Recognition==
Ambartsumian was one of the 20th century&#x27;s leading astrophysicists{{efn|&quot;...recognized as one of the giants of twentieth-century astrophysics...&quot; &lt;br&gt;&quot;Victor Ambartsumian, a giant of world astrophysics, alive...&quot;}} and astronomers.{{efn|Geoffrey Burbidge: &quot;...one of the giants of astronomical research in the 20th century...&quot;}} He was the leading astronomer of the Soviet Union{{efn|Leonard Searle, 1958: &quot;The authors are prominent Soviet astrophysicists and the complete volume is edited by the most eminent of them, V. A. Ambartsumyan.&quot;
*Walter Sullivan, 1964: &quot;The observatory is the headquarters of Viktor A. Ambartsumian, Russia&#x27;s foremost astronomer...&quot; 
*Jaan Einasto, 2013: &quot;I visited in autumn 1977 Byurakan Observatory and discussed the idea with Viktor Ambartsumian, the most influential astronomer of the USSR.&quot;}} and is universally recognized as the founder of the Soviet school of theoretical astrophysics.{{efn|Russian Academy of Sciences: &quot;основоположник советской школы теоретической астрофизики&quot;&lt;br&gt;Andrei Severny and Viktor Sobolev: &quot;V. A. Ambartsumyan is considered to be, by right, the founder of Soviet theoretical astrophysics.&quot; &lt;br&gt;Garik Israelian: &quot;It is commonly accepted that V.A. Ambartsumian was a father of the Soviet school of Theoretical Astrophysics.&quot; &lt;br&gt;A. David Andrews: &quot;This eminent founder of astrophysics in the former Soviet Union...&quot; }} Ambartsumian was also well-regarded internationally.{{efn|The authors of a 1981 US government report described him as &quot;among the Soviet Union&#x27;s best-known and most respected scientists abroad.&quot;}} Loren Graham called him &quot;one of the best-known abroad of all Soviet scientists.&quot;{{sfn|Graham|1987|p=391}} He was an honorary or foreign member of academies of sciences of over 25 countries.

Despite being a Soviet scientist, he was well-regarded in the United States. During the Cold War, Ambartsumian was the first Soviet scientist to become foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences in 1958 and 1959, respectively.{{efn|&quot;the first Soviet Scientist since World War II to become a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.&quot; &quot;The National Academy of Sciences announced today that Viktor A. Ambartsumyan, a Soviet astronomer, had been made a foreign associate of the academy -- the first Soviet scientist to be so honored in over a decade.&quot;}} In January 1971 Ambartsumian was invited to the U.S. House Committee on Science and Astronautics, where he was introduced by Fred Lawrence Whipple as a &quot;man who is rated the world&#x27;s greatest astronomer or at least among the very greatest.&quot;

In 1977 Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar stated: &quot;My own impression has always been that he was, when he was in his prime, one of the most perceptive and elegant of astronomers.&quot; Chandrasekhar opined in 1988:
{{quote frame|Academician Ambartsumian’s realm does not divide astronomy and astrophysics into its conventional parts: theoretical and observational. He is an astronomer &quot;par excellence&quot;. [...] There can be no more than two or three astronomers in this century who can look back on a life so worthily devoted to the progress of astronomy.}}

===In Armenia===
After he visited Byurakan for the First Soviet-American Conference on Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence in 1971, William H. McNeill wrote that Ambartsumian is a &quot;world famous astronomer and a man of enormous local prestige.&quot; One of the &quot;modern icons of Armenian pride,&quot; Ambartsumian is recognized as the most prominent scientist in 20th century Armenia, and the most important since the seventh century polymath Anania Shirakatsi. Fadey Sargsyan, Ambartsumian&#x27;s successor as President of the Armenian Academy of Sciences, stated in 1998 that he went &quot;beyond the limits of his scientific fields and in his own lifetime [became] a great national figure.&quot;

On 11 October 1994 Armenia&#x27;s President Levon Ter-Petrosyan awarded Ambartsumian the title of a National Hero of Armenia for his scientific work of international significance, science administration and patriotic activism. His official obituary was signed by Armenia&#x27;s president, government and parliament.

===Tribute===
An asteroid discovered at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in 1972 by Tamara Smirnova is named 1905 Ambartsumian. Ambartsumian&#x27;s Knot is a small tidal dwarf galaxy located in NGC 3561 in the constellation Ursa Major.

In 1998 Ambartsumian&#x27;s 90th anniversary was celebrated in Armenia; the International Astronomical Union held a symposium at the Byurakan Observatory and the Central Bank of Armenia issued a 100 dram banknote depicting Ambartsumian and the Byurakan Observatory. The Byurakan Observatory was officially named after him that year. Other things named after Ambartsumian include Chair of General Physics and Astrophysics at Yerevan State University, a street, park, and public school in Yerevan, and the Pedagogical Institute of Vardenis.

In 2009 a {{convert|3.2|m|adj=on}} bronze statue of Ambartsumian was unveiled in Yerevan at the park around the Yerevan Observatory in attendance of President Serzh Sargsyan and other officials. Busts of Ambartsumian stand at the Byurakan Observatory, the city of Vardenis (1978), and at the central campus of Yerevan State University.

In 2009 Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan established an international prize in Ambartsumian&#x27;s memory. It was first awarded in 2010 and is awarded every two years. The prize was initially $500,000, but was reduced to $300,000 in 2018. It is considered one of the prestigious awards in astronomy and related fields.

==Publications==
Throughout his career, Ambartsumian authored some 20 books and booklets and over 200 academic papers.

===&quot;Theoretical Astrophysics&quot; (1952)===
Ambartsumian served as editor and senior author of the 1952 book &quot;Teoreticheskaia Astrofizika&quot; (Теоретическая астрофизика).{{sfn|Lynden-Bell|Gurzadyan|1998|p=25}} It is an extended version of his 1939 book on theoretical astrophysics—the first systematic textbook on the subject in Russian—based on his lectures at Leningrad State University.{{sfn|Lynden-Bell|Gurzadyan|1998|p=25}} It was translated into a number of languages, including English, German, and Chinese.{{sfn|Lynden-Bell|Gurzadyan|1998|p=25}} The English translation appeared in 1958 as &quot;Theoretical Astrophysics&quot;. It became a bible for a generation of astronomers and astrophysicists and was well received by reviewers. Roderick Oliver Redman called it &quot;a welcome addition to the comparatively few general texts of solid worth which are now available&quot; and noted that in a short time it had found &quot;many appreciative readers in both German and English speaking countries.&quot; Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin wrote that it is the &quot;only advanced book of this scope in English, it will be of the greatest value.&quot; George B. Field described the book as &quot;comprehensively and competently constructed.&quot; A. David Andrews described it as a &quot;valuable textbook&quot;, which &quot;contains examples of [Ambartsumian&#x27;s] unique and fruitful approaches to stubborn astronomical problems.&quot; Leonard Searle lauded the sections on stellar atmospheres, but criticized the section on interstellar material, especially the constitution of stars as outdated for ignoring fundamental post-war western contributions.

<text>A miniature horse is a breed or type of horse characterised by its small size. Usually it has been bred to display in miniature the physical characteristics of a full-sized horse, but to be little over in height, or even less. Although such horses have the appearance of small horses, they are genetically much more similar to pony breeds such as the Shetland. They have various colors and coat patterns.

Miniature horses are present in several countries, including Argentina, Australia, France, Germany, Holland, Ireland, Namibia, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and the United States. In some countries they have the status of a breed; these include the Falabella of Argentina, the Dutch Miniature or , the South African Miniature Horse and the American Miniature Horse.

They are commonly kept as companion animals, or for sporting activities such as driving or other competitive horse show events. A few have been trained as guide horses for blind people.

==History==

Miniature horses originated in Europe, where there is written and iconographic documentation of them from the late eighteenth century. In the first half of the twentieth century small horses were bred in England by Lady Estella Mary Hope and her sister Lady Dorothea.

The Falabella was developed in Argentina in the mid-1800s by Patrick Newtall. When Newtall died, the herd and breeding methods were passed to his son-in-law, Juan Falabella. Falabella added additional bloodlines including the Welsh Pony, Shetland pony, and small Thoroughbreds. With considerable inbreeding he was able to gain consistently small size within the herd.

The South African Miniature Horse was bred in South Africa from about 1945, when Wynand de Wet of Lindley began selective breeding of Shetland stock. In 2011 there were about 700 of the horses in the country. Morphology is variable: some have an Arab appearance, while others have the conformation of a draft horse. A breed association was established in 1984, and in 1989 the South African Miniature was recognized by the national South African Stud Book and Livestock Improvement Association.

== Characteristics ==
Miniature horses are generally quite hardy. They often live for longer than is typical for full-sized horses of some breeds; the usual life span is from 25 to 35 years. 

Their predisposition to disease is markedly different from that of full-sized horses. They are only rarely affected by ailments such as laryngeal hemiplegia, osteochondrosis or navicular disease, all of which are common in larger horses, but are much more likely to develop other illnesses rare in large horses, such as hyperlipaemia — which may lead to hepatic lipidosis — or eclampsia. Dental misalignment and overcrowding are more common than in larger horses: brachygnathism (&quot;parrot mouth&quot;) and prognathism (&quot;sow mouth&quot;) are often seen; retention of caps can occur, as can infection of the sinuses associated with tooth eruption. Poor mastication can contribute to an increased incidence of colic caused by enteroliths, faecoliths, or sand.

== Use ==

Miniature horses are commonly kept as companion animals. They are often too small for any but the smallest riders to ride, but are well suited to driving; some may participate in other horse show events. A small number have been trained as guide horses for blind people, particularly for those who consider dogs unclean, as is common in Muslim cultures.

<doc id="622007" wikidata="Q1438483" url="?curid=622007" title="Fort Caroline">
<text>Fort Caroline was an attempted French colonial settlement in Florida, located on the banks of the St. Johns River in present-day Duval County. It was established under the leadership of René Goulaine de Laudonnière on 22 June 1564, following King Charles IX&#x27;s enlisting of Jean Ribault and his Huguenot settlers to stake a claim in French Florida ahead of Spain. The French colony came into conflict with the Spanish, who established St. Augustine on 8 September 1565, and Fort Caroline was sacked by Spanish troops under Pedro Menéndez de Avilés on 20 September. The Spanish continued to occupy the site as San Mateo until 1569.

The exact site of the former fort is unknown. In 1953 the National Park Service established the Fort Caroline National Memorial along the southern bank of the St. John&#x27;s River near the point that commemorates Laudonnière&#x27;s first landing. This is generally accepted by scholars as being in the vicinity of the original fort, though probably not the exact location. The memorial is now managed as a part of the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, but it is also a distinct unit under administration of the National Park Service.

==History==
===Charlesfort (1562–1563, 1577–1578)===

A French expedition, organized by Protestant leader Admiral Gaspard de Coligny and led by the French Explorer Jean Ribault, had landed at the site on the May River (now the St. Johns River) in May 1562. Here Ribault encountered the Timucuans led by Chief Saturiwa. Ribault took some 28 troops north along the coast, where on present-day Parris Island, South Carolina they developed a settlement known as Charlesfort. Ribault returned to Europe to arrange supplies for the new colony. When he was captured and briefly imprisoned in England on suspicion of spying related to the French Wars of Religion, he was prevented from returning to Florida.

After a year without supplies or leadership, and beset by hostility from the native populations, all but one of the colonists left Charlesfort to sail back to Europe. During their voyage in an open boat, they were reduced to cannibalism before the survivors were rescued in English waters. Another French force reestablished a fort at the site in 1577–1578.

===Fort Caroline (1564–1565)===
Meanwhile, René Goulaine de Laudonnière, who had been Ribault&#x27;s second-in-command on the 1562 expedition, led a contingent of around 200 new settlers back to Florida, where they founded Fort Caroline (or &quot;Fort de la Caroline&quot;) on 22 June, 1564; the site was on a small plain formed by the western slope of the high steep bank later called St. Johns Bluff. The fort was named for King Charles IX of France. For just over a year, this settlement was beset by hunger and desertion, and attracted the attention of Spanish authorities who considered it a challenge to their control over the area.

The French colonists &quot;had to rely heavily on the Indians&quot; for both food and trade. The Timucua welcomed them. French soldiers also traveled across Timucuan territory, encountering the Yustaga people and unsuccessfully seeking gold and silver mines. Timucua chief Outina twice &quot;coaxed the French into participating in attacks on villages of his rival, [the] Potano, to seize surplus corn.&quot; French soldiers who deserted from the fort raided Timucua settlements, souring relations with them. In spring 1565, Outina rebuffed a third request for food and was taken hostage by the French, provoking open confrontation with the Timucua that included &quot;two tense weeks of skirmishes and one all-out battle.&quot; The French relented and released Outina.
On 20 July, 1565, the English adventurer John Hawkins arrived at the fort with his fleet looking for fresh water; there he exchanged his smallest ship for four cannons and a supply of powder and shot. The ship and provisions gained from Hawkins enabled the French to survive and prepare to move back to France as soon as possible. As Laudonnière writes: &quot;I may saye that wee receaved as manye courtesies of the Generall, as it was possible to receive of any man living. Wherein doubtlesse hee hath wonne the reputation of a good and charitable man, deserving to be esteemed as much of us all as if hee had saved all our lives.&quot; The French introduced Hawkins to tobacco, which they all were using, and in turn he introduced it to England upon his return.

In late August, Ribault, who had been released from English custody in June 1565 and sent by Coligny back to Florida, arrived at Fort Caroline with a large fleet and hundreds of soldiers and settlers, taking command of the colony. However, the recently appointed Spanish Governor of Florida, Don Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, had simultaneously been dispatched from Spain with orders to remove the French outpost, and arrived within days of Ribault&#x27;s landing. After a brief skirmish between Ribault&#x27;s ships and Menéndez&#x27;s ships, the latter retreated southward, where they established the settlement of St. Augustine. Ribault pursued the Spanish with several of his ships and most of his troops, but he was surprised at sea by a violent storm lasting several days. Meanwhile, Menéndez launched an assault on Fort Caroline by marching his forces overland during the storm, leading a surprise dawn attack on Fort Caroline on 20 September. At this time, the garrison contained 200 to 250 people. The only survivors were about 50 women and children who were taken prisoner and a few defenders, including Laudonnière, who managed to escape; the rest were massacred.
As for Ribault&#x27;s fleet, all of the ships either sank or ran aground south of St. Augustine during the storm, and many of the Frenchmen on board were lost at sea. Ribault and his marooned sailors marched northwards and were eventually located by Menéndez with his troops and summoned to surrender. Apparently believing that his men would be well treated, Ribault capitulated. Menéndez then executed Ribault and several hundred Huguenots (Francisco López de Mendoza Grajales, chaplain to the Spanish forces, identifies them as &quot;all Lutherans&quot; and dates their execution 29 September 1565, St. Michael&#x27;s Day) as heretics at what is now known as the Matanzas Inlet. (&quot;Matanzas&quot; is Spanish for &quot;slaughters&quot;.) The atrocity shocked Europeans even in that bloody era of religious strife. A fort built much later, Fort Matanzas, is in the vicinity of the site. This massacre ended France&#x27;s attempts at colonization of the southeastern Atlantic coast of North America until 1577–1578 when Nicholas Strozzi and his crew built a fort after their ship, &quot;Le Prince&quot;, was wrecked at Port Royal Sound.

The Spanish destroyed Fort Caroline and built their own fort on the same site. In April 1568, Dominique de Gourgues led a French force which attacked, captured and burned the fort. He then slaughtered the Spanish prisoners in revenge for the 1565 massacre. The Spanish rebuilt, but permanently abandoned the fort the following year. The exact location of the fort is not known.

== Free Black population at Fort Caroline==
When the Spanish conquistador Pedro Menéndez, who had black crew members in his fleet, founded St. Augustine in 1565, he wrote that his settlers had been preceded by free Africans in the French settlement at Fort Caroline. The fort also employed Black slave labor. Together, Fort Caroline and the St. Augustine area represent some of the earliest points of history for the Black (and Black Catholic) community of what would become the United States.
== Reproductions of Fort Caroline and speculation ==
The original site of Fort de la Caroline has never been determined, but it is believed to have been located near the present-day Fort Caroline National Memorial. The National Park Service constructed an outdoor exhibit of the original fort in 1964, but it was destroyed by Hurricane Dora in the same year. Today, the second replica, a near full-scale &quot;interpretive model&quot; of the original Fort de la Caroline, also constructed and maintained by the National Park Service, illustrates the modest defenses upon which the 16th-century French colonists depended.

==Proposed alternative location==
On 21 February 2014, researchers Fletcher Crowe and Anita Spring presented claims at a conference hosted by Florida State University that Fort Caroline was located not on the St. Johns River, but on the Altamaha River in southeast Georgia. The scholars proposed that period French maps, particularly a 1685 map of &quot;French Florida&quot; from the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, support the more northern location. They further argued that the Native Americans living near the fort spoke Guale, the language spoken in what is now Coastal Georgia, rather than Timucua, the language of northeast Florida. Other scholars have been skeptical of the hypothesis. University of North Florida archaeologist Robert Thunen considers the documentary evidence weak and believes the location is implausibly far from St. Augustine, considering the Spanish were able to march overland to Fort Caroline in two days amid a hurricane. Chuck Meide, archaeologist at the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Museum, expressed similar criticism on the museum&#x27;s blog, noting that other French and American scholars at the conference seemed similarly skeptical.

<doc id="622019" wikidata="Q5632320" url="?curid=622019" title="HMS Eskimo (F119)">
<text>HMS &quot;Eskimo&quot; was a frigate of the Royal Navy in service from 1963 to 1980. She was scrapped in 1992.

&quot;Eskimo&quot; was built by J. Samuel White, of Cowes, at a cost of £4,670,000. The frigate was launched on 20 March 1961 and commissioned on 21 February 1963 with the pennant number F119.

==Service==

&#x27;Eskimo&#x27; began her third commission in October 1966. Sailing from Portsmouth in May 1967, she arrived off Port Said on the morning of 5 June, but due to the outbreak of war between Israel and the surrounding Arab states (the six day war), she was unable to transit the Suez Canal as planned. ‘Eskimo’ then spent some three months in the Mediterranean (based primarily in Malta) before eventually sailing to the Middle East via Gibraltar, Simonstown (South Africa), two Beira patrols, and Mombasa, arriving on station in Bahrain in December of that year. She subsequently replaced her sister ship &quot;Ashanti&quot; off Aden in 1968 in support of the withdrawal of British troops from that colony. ‘Eskimo’ finally returned to the UK in May 1968 having spent a full twelve months away from home. Later in the year she took part in Portsmouth &#x27;Navy Days&#x27;. Between 1966 and 1967 she was commanded by Simon Cassels.

During 1974 and 1975 she was commanded by Alan Grose.

Due to a manpower shortage in the Royal Navy, &quot;Eskimo&quot; was reduced to the reserve in 1980, being placed into the Standby Squadron, and in 1981 was put on the disposal list. In 1984 she was cannibalised for spare parts for three Tribal-class frigates sold to Indonesia. On 16 January 1986, &quot;Eskimo&quot; was towed from Portsmouth to Pembroke Dock to be used as a target, but was not used as such. In May 1992 she was towed from Pembroke to Bilbao, Spain to be scrapped.

<text>Ramón Montoya (November 2, 1879, Madrid, Spain – July 20, 1949, Madrid, Spain) was a Flamenco guitarist and composer.

Born into a family of Gitano (Romani) cattle traders, Ramón Montoya used earnings from working in the trade to purchase his first guitar. He began playing in the cafés de cante before he was twenty years of age.

He formed a partnership with the great flamenco cantaor (singer) Antonio Chacón that started in 1912 and lasted more than a decade. Both participated in the Concurso de Cante Jondo of 1922 held in Granada. These two were largely responsible for establishing the form of the various traditional flamenco cantes that are recognized today.

In traditional flamenco, the guitar was relegated to a supporting role. Cante (singing) and baile (dance) were the main performers whom the guitarist supported. Montoya was one of the first to challenge this role. His strong playing often overpowered the singer whom he accompanied. He eventually took the next logical step and began to play as a solo or lead performer in a concert setting. His performances are widely credited by flamenco historians as establishing the flamenco guitar in this role.

He was the single most influential flamenco guitarist of the 20th century. His innovations made possible the solo careers of such later greats as Sabicas and Paco de Lucía.

He is the uncle of flamenco guitarist Carlos Montoya. His granddaughter, Rosa Montoya, is most known for introducing flamenco dance to most of California with her studio based in San Francisco.

<text>Johan Petter Johansson (December 12, 1853 – August 25, 1943), sometimes known as JP, was a Swedish inventor and industrialist. He invented a modern adjustable spanner (patents in 1891 and 11 May 1892). He obtained over 100 patents in total.

He was born in Vårgårda in western Sweden, the oldest of six children in a crofter&#x27;s family. His first employment was as an assistant operator of a steam engine at a local peat factory. He left Vårgårda at age 19, in 1873, for Motala to work as a navvy. Following military service in 1874, he moved to Eskilstuna where he worked for the Bolinder-Munktell factory, and in 1878 he moved to Västerås where he found employment at a mechanical workshop. Following that, he worked as a blacksmith at a nearby farm.

At this time, he had made a decision to leave Sweden for the United States. This never happened; he was instead offered a more esteemed job by his former employer Munktells, and the offer changed his mind.

In 1886 he decided to start his own business and relocated to Enköping where he started &quot;Enköpings Mekaniska Verkstad&quot; (the Mechanical Workshop of Enköping), which quickly became a successful venture. It was during the years in his workshop that he invented the adjustable spanner and the plumber wrench. In 1890, B.A. Hjorth &amp; Company agreed to distribute his tools worldwide under the &quot;Bahco&quot; trademark. The Bahco tools are still in production, having over 100 million wrenches manufactured to date.

Johansson transferred the then-large enterprise to his son, Hannes Brynge, and the B.A. Hjorth &amp; Company in 1916. He started experimenting with Armature (electrical) and in 1919 opened a new factory, Triplex, which manufactured electrical pendulums and various devices.
He died at the age of 89 after having been productive for most of his life.

<doc id="622034" wikidata="Q221539" url="?curid=622034" title="Connecting rod">
<text>A connecting rod, also called a &#x27;con rod&#x27;, is the part of a piston engine which connects the piston to the crankshaft. Together with the crank, the connecting rod converts the reciprocating motion of the piston into the rotation of the crankshaft. The connecting rod is required to transmit the compressive and tensile forces from the piston. In its most common form, in an internal combustion engine, it allows pivoting on the piston end and rotation on the shaft end.

The predecessor to the connecting rod is a mechanic linkage used by water mills to convert rotating motion of the water wheel into reciprocating motion.

The most common usage of connecting rods is in internal combustion engines or on steam engines.

== Origins ==
A connecting rod crank has been found in the Celtic Oppida at Paule in Brittany, dated to 69BC

The predecessor to the connecting length is the mechanical linkage used by Roman-era watermills. An early example of this linkage has been found at the late 3rd century Hierapolis sawmill in Roman Asia (modern Turkey) and the 6th century saw mills at Ephesus in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) and at Gerasa in Roman Syria. The crank and connecting rod mechanism of these machines converted the rotary motion of the waterwheel into the linear movement of the saw blades.

An early documentation of the design occurred sometime between 1174 and 1206 AD in the Artuqid State (modern Turkey), when inventor Al-Jazari described a machine which incorporated the connecting rod with a crankshaft to pump water as part of a water-raising machine, though the device was more complex than typical crank and connecting rod designs. There is also documentation of cranks with connecting rods in the sketch books of Taccola from Renaissance Italy and 15th century painter Pisanello.
== Steam engines ==
The 1712 Newcomen atmospheric engine (the first steam engine) used chain drive instead of a connecting rod, since the piston only produced force in one direction. However, most steam engines after this are double-acting, therefore the force is produced in both directions, leading to the use of a connecting rod. The typical arrangement uses a large sliding bearing block called a crosshead with the hinge between the piston and connecting rod placed outside the cylinder, requiring a seal around the piston rod.
In a steam locomotive, the cranks are usually mounted directly on the driving wheels. The connecting rod is used between the crank pin on the wheel and the crosshead (where it connects to the piston rod). On smaller steam locomotives, the connecting rods are usually of rectangular cross-section, however marine-type rods of circular cross-section have occasionally been used.

On paddle steamers, the connecting rods are called &#x27;pitmans&#x27; (not to be mistaken for pitman arms).

== Internal combustion engines ==
A connecting rod for an internal combustion engine consists of the &#x27;big end&#x27;, &#x27;rod&#x27; and &#x27;small end&#x27;. The small end attaches to the gudgeon pin (also called &#x27;piston pin&#x27; or &#x27;wrist pin&#x27; in the U.S.), which allows for rotation between the connecting rod and the piston. Typically, the big end connects to the crankpin using a plain bearing to reduce friction; however some smaller engines may instead use a rolling-element bearing, in order to avoid the need for a pumped lubrication system. Connecting rods with rolling element bearings are typically a one piece design where the crankshaft must be pressed together through them, rather than a two piece design that can be bolted around the journal of a one piece crankshaft.

Typically there is a pinhole bored through the bearing on the big end of the connecting rod so that lubricating oil squirts out onto the thrust side of the cylinder wall to lubricate the travel of the pistons and piston rings.

A connecting rod can rotate at both ends, so that the angle between the connecting rod and the piston can change as the rod moves up and down and rotates around the crankshaft.

=== Materials ===
The materials used for connecting rods widely vary, including carbon steel, iron base sintered metal, micro-alloyed steel, spheroidized graphite cast iron. In mass-produced automotive engines, the connecting rods are most usually made of steel. In high performance applications, &quot;billet&quot; connecting rods can be used, which are machined out of a solid billet of metal, rather than being cast or forged.

Other materials include T6-2024 aluminium alloy or T651-7075 aluminium alloy, which are used for lightness and the ability to absorb high impact at the expense of durability. Titanium is a more expensive option which reduces the weight. Cast iron can be used for cheaper, lower performance applications such as motor scooters.
=== Failure during operation ===
During each rotation of the crankshaft, a connecting rod is often subject to large and repetitive forces: shear forces due to the angle between the piston and the crankpin, compression forces as the piston moves downwards, and tensile forces as the piston moves upwards. These forces are proportional to the engine speed (RPM) squared.

Failure of a connecting rod, often called &quot;throwing a rod&quot;, often forces the broken rod through the side of the crankcase and thereby renders the engine irreparable. Common causes of connecting rod failure are tensile failure from high engine speeds, the impact force when the piston hits a valve (due to a valvetrain problem), rod bearing failure (usually due to a lubrication problem), or incorrect installation of the connecting rod.
=== Cylinder wear ===
The sideways force exerted on the piston through the connecting rod by the crankshaft can cause the cylinders to wear into an oval shape. This significantly reduces engine performance, since the circular piston rings are unable to properly seal against the oval-shaped cylinder walls.

The amount of sideways force is proportional to the angle of the connecting rod, therefore longer connecting rods will reduce the amount of sideways force and engine wear. However, the maximum length of a connecting rod is constrained by the engine block size; the stroke length plus the connecting rod length must not result in the piston travelling past the top of the engine block.
=== Master-and-slave rods ===

Radial engines typically use master-and-slave connecting rods, whereby one piston (the uppermost piston in the animation), has a master rod with a direct attachment to the crankshaft. The remaining pistons pin their connecting rods&#x27; attachments to rings around the edge of the master rod.

Multi-bank engines with many cylinders, such as V12 engines, have little space available for many connecting rod journals on a limited length of crankshaft. The simplest solution, as used in most road car engines, is for each pair of cylinders to share a crank journal, but this reduces the size of the rod bearings and means that matching (i.e. opposite) cylinders in the different banks are slightly offset along the crankshaft axis (which creates a rocking couple). Another solution is to use master-and-slave connecting rods, where the master rod also includes one or more ring pins which are connected to the big ends of slave rods on other cylinders. A drawback of master-slave rods is that the stroke lengths of all slave pistons not located 180° from the master piston will always be slightly longer than that of the master piston, which increases vibration in V engines.

One of the most complicated examples of master-and-slave connecting rods is the 24-cylinder Junkers Jumo 222 experimental airplane engine developed for World War II. This engine consisted of six banks of cylinders, each with four cylinders per bank. Each &quot;layer&quot; of six cylinders used one master connecting rod, with the other five cylinders using slave rods. Approximately 300 test engines were built, however the engine did not reach production.
=== Fork-and-blade rods ===
Fork-and-blade rods, also known as &quot;split big-end rods&quot;, have been used on V-twin motorcycle engines and V12 aircraft engines. For each pair of cylinders, a &quot;fork&quot; rod is split in two at the big end and the &quot;blade&quot; rod from the opposing cylinder is thinned to fit into this gap in the fork. This arrangement removes the rocking couple that is caused when cylinder pairs are offset along the crankshaft.

A common arrangement for the big-end bearing is for the fork rod to have a single wide bearing sleeve that spans the whole width of the rod, including the central gap. The blade rod then runs, not directly on the crankpin, but on the outside of this sleeve. This causes the two rods to oscillate back and forth (instead of rotating relative to each other), which reduces the forces on the bearing and the surface speed. However the bearing movement also becomes reciprocating rather than continuously rotating, which is a more difficult problem for lubrication.

Notable engines to use fork-and-blade rods include the Rolls-Royce Merlin V12 aircraft engine, EMD two-stroke Diesel engines, and various Harley Davidson V-twin motorcycle engines.

<text>Highway 28 is an east–west highway on the northern part of Vancouver Island, within the Strathcona Regional District. It is the main link to the northern part of Strathcona Provincial Park and the remote logging communities of Gold River and Tahsis, on the northwest coast of the Island. The highway first opened in 1970. Before the section of Highway 19 from Campbell River to Port Hardy was opened in 1979, Highway 28 acted as the main access to Port Hardy and various other communities on the northern tip of the Island (in the Regional District of Mount Waddington), aided by a system of local logging roads leading from the highway to the various north Island communities.

==History==
Originally a logging road that connected to Highway 19, a few kilometres west of Campbell River, the road split, one alignment going south into Strathcona Park, and the other going west to Gold River, which looped north of Upper Campbell Lake. By 1970 a paved Highway was built over most of the logging road. Abandoning the west logging road, the new highway continued south, reaching the south end of Upper Campbell Lake. A bridge was built over the river between Buttle Lake and Upper Campbell Lake and a stretch of highway was added to where the west logging road connected. The rest of the road that lead to Gold River was subsequently paved. The access to Port Hardy, however, was left unchanged until 1976 when Highway 19 was extended north.

==Route details==

Highway 28&#x27;s total length is . Starting in Gold River at the shore of Muchalat Inlet, Highway 28 follows the Gold and Heber Rivers northeast for before entering Strathcona Provincial Park. The highway winds its way east through the park, following the Elk River, for , then hugs Upper Campbell Lake for another to its junction with the road to Westmin Mines. 37 km later (23 mi), the highway enters the city limits of Campbell River, finally terminating later at a junction with Highways 19 and 19A, in the northern part of the city.

<text>In Spiritualism, paranormal literature and some religions, materialization (or manifestation) is the creation or appearance of matter from unknown sources. The existence of materialization has not been confirmed by laboratory experiments. Numerous cases of fraudulent materialization demonstrations by mediums have been exposed.

==History==

In the early 20th century a series of exposures of fraudulent activity led to a decline of materialization séances. The poet Robert Browning and his wife Elizabeth attended a séance on 23, July 1855 in Ealing with the Rymers. During the séance a spirit face materialized which Home claimed was the son of Browning who had died in infancy. Browning seized the &quot;materialization&quot; and discovered it to be the bare foot of Home. To make the deception worse, Browning had never lost a son in infancy. Browning&#x27;s son Robert, in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; on 5 December 1902, referred to the incident and said that &quot;Home was detected in a vulgar fraud.&quot;

The British materialization medium Rosina Mary Showers was caught in many fraudulent séances throughout her career. In 1874, during a séance with Edward William Cox, a sitter looked into the cabinet and seized the spirit, the head dress fell off and was revealed to be Showers. On March 29 and May 21, 1874 Florence Cook in her own Home held séances with William Crookes. It was alleged that a spirit called &quot;Katie King&quot; materialized, however according to the author Walter Mann &quot;Katie was a confederate introduced by Florrie Cook. It was the easiest matter in the world to carry out this trick, since the room, described by Sir William as the &#x27;cabinet&#x27;, was Florrie Cook&#x27;s bedroom.&quot;

Frank Herne. a medium who formed a partnership with Charles Williams, was repeatedly exposed in fraudulent materialization séances. In 1875, he was caught pretending to be a spirit during a séance in Liverpool and was found &quot;clothed in about two yards of stiffened muslin, wound round his head and hanging down as far as his thigh&quot;. Florence Cook had been &quot;trained in the arts of the séance&quot; by Herne and was repeatedly exposed as a fraudulent medium.

The psychical researchers W. W. Baggally and Everard Feilding exposed the British materialization medium Christopher Chambers as a fraud in 1905. A false moustache was discovered in the séance room which he used to fabricate the spirit materializations. The British medium Charles Eldred was exposed as a fraud in 1906. Eldred would sit in a chair in a curtained off area in the room known as a &quot;séance cabinet&quot;. Various spirit figures would emerge from the cabinet and move around the séance room, however, it was discovered that the chair had a secret compartment that contained beards, cloths, masks, and wigs that Eldred would dress up in to fake the spirits.

Albert von Schrenck-Notzing investigated the medium Eva Carrière and said that her reputed ectoplasm materializations were the result of &quot;ideoplasty&quot; in which the medium could form images onto ectoplasm from her mind. Schrenck-Notzing published the book &quot;Phenomena of Materialisation&quot; (1923) which included photographs of the ectoplasm. Critics pointed out the photographs of the ectoplasm revealed marks of magazine cut-outs, pins and a piece of string. Schrenck-Notzing admitted that on several occasions Carrière deceptively smuggled pins into the séance room. The magician Carlos María de Heredia replicated the ectoplasm of Carrière using a comb, gauze and a handkerchief.

Donald West wrote that the ectoplasm of Carrière was fake and was made of cut-out paper faces from newspapers and magazines on which fold marks could sometimes be seen from the photographs. A photograph of Carrière taken from the back of the ectoplasm face revealed it to be made from a magazine cut out with the letters &quot;Le Miro&quot;. The two-dimensional face had been clipped from the French magazine Le Miroir. Back issues of the magazine also matched some of Carrière&#x27;s ectoplasm faces. Cut out faces that she used included Woodrow Wilson, King Ferdinand of Bulgaria, French president Raymond Poincaré and the actress Mona Delza.

After Schrenck-Notzing discovered Carrière had taken her ectoplasm faces from the magazine he defended her by claiming she had read the magazine but her memory had recalled the images and they had materialized into the ectoplasm. Because of this Schrenck-Notzing was described as credulous. Joseph McCabe wrote &quot;In Germany and Austria, Baron von Schrenck-Notzing is the laughing-stock of his medical colleagues.&quot;

In 1907, Hereward Carrington exposed the tricks of fraudulent mediums such as those used in slate-writing, table-turning, trumpet mediumship, materializations, sealed-letter reading and spirit photography. Between 8 November and 31 December 1920 Gustav Geley of the Institute Metapsychique International attended fourteen séances with the medium Franek Kluski in Paris. A bowl of hot paraffin was placed in the room and according to Kluski spirits dipped their limbs into the paraffin and then into a bath of water to materialize. Three other series of séances were held in Warsaw in Kluski&#x27;s own apartment, these took place over a period of three years. Kluski was not searched in any of the séances. Photographs of the molds were obtained during the four series of experiments and were published by Geley in 1924. Human skin hairs were found on the moulds which has indicated fraud. Harry Houdini replicated the Kluski materialization moulds by using his hands and a bowl of hot paraffin.

Erlendur Haraldsson investigated one of the Hindu swamis, who are associated with frequent and widely accepted claims of materializations of objects or substances, namely Gyatri Swami, and reached a negative conclusion regarding his claims.

Indian gurus Sathya Sai Baba (died 2011) and Swami Premananda have claimed to perform materializations. Spontaneous vibuthi (holy ash) manifestations are reported by Sai Baba&#x27;s followers on his pictures at their homes. Skeptics have suspected the materializations of Sathya Sai Baba were fraudulent and the result of sleight of hand tricks. The magician P. C. Sorcar wrote Sai Baba&#x27;s vibhuti feat was a &quot;common trick&quot; conjured with an ash capsule.

<text>Oro-Medonte is a township in south-central Ontario, Canada, on the northwestern shores of Lake Simcoe in Simcoe County.

The two neighbouring townships of Oro and Medonte were merged in 1994, under a restructuring of Simcoe County. It is divided into lines based on the concession system implemented by the British colonial government in the mid-18th century. Currently there are 15 lines that are now streets and highway exits off Highway 11.

==Communities==
The township comprises the communities of Barrillia Park, Bass Lake Park, Baywood Park, Big Cedar Estates, Braestone, Carley, Carthew Bay, Cedarmont Beach, Coulson, Craighurst, Creighton, Crown Hill, Eady, East Oro, Edgar, Eight Mile Point, Fair Valley, Fergus Hill Estate, Knox Corners, Forest Home, Foxmead, Guthrie, Hawkestone, Hawkestone Beach, Hobart, Horseshoe Valley, Jarratt, Lakeview, Martinville, Mitchell Square, Moons Beach, Moonstone, Mount St. Louis, Oro Beach, Oro Lea Beach, Oro Park, Oro Station, Palm Beach, Parkside Beach, Prices Corners, Roberta Park, Rugby, Shanty Bay, Simcoeside, Sugar Bush, Vasey, Waddington Beach and Warminster.

==History==

First Nations had long established encampments and trails on the bank of Hawkestone Creek, Ridge Road, Mount St. Louis, and throughout the Township of Oro-Medonte.

The Huron village of Cahiagué (near Hawkestone) was the capital village of the Ahrendarrhonon (Rock) nation. In 1615, Samuel de Champlain estimated the village to comprise 200 houses.

The War of 1812 drew attention to the militarily strategic region between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay. To provide supplies to the excellent harbour at Penetanguishene, a road of about 35 km was surveyed c. 1813 between the two bodies of water. That road did not actually become a functional road for about 30 years after it was surveyed. In the meantime, townships were created and surveyed on both sides of the Penetanguishene Rd c. 1820. Oro Township was one of those townships. Although there is no documentation about the origin of the name &quot;Oro&quot; it is assumed it came from the Spanish word for gold.

After the War of 1812, Sir Peregrine Maitland, then Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, offered Black veterans grants of land in what was to become the Township of Oro. This was in the area between Kempenfelt Bay on Lake Simcoe and Penetanguishene Bay on Lake Huron&#x27;s Georgian Bay.

In the 1830s, Richard Hodges established a landing for settlers, mainly from the British Isles, who after arriving by lake steamer, on Lake Simcoe, followed these trails to their settlement in search of independence and land ownership.

Craighurst started as a small community on the Penetanguishene Road in the 1830s. Its post office was established in the 1850s, at its peak in the late 19th century, Craighurst had four hotels, three churches, and a school house.

A thriving community of a tavern, hotel, store and the first post office was located near the lake east of the creek at Hodges&#x27; Landing. The first postmaster was Charles Bell. Two dams and three mills sawed logs and ground grains. It is thought that the first mill was established by John Williamson who subsequently built the large brick house on the North-East corner of the Ridge Road and Line No. 11 South. In 1856 a new wharf was constructed and the name was changed from Hodges&#x27; Landing to Hawkestone.

The establishment of Shanty Bay was strongly influenced by the Underground Railroad. Many African-American refugees first settled near the water in shanties (small homes), contributing toward the name of the village. Lucius Richard O&#x27;Brien (1832–1899), the noted oil and watercolour landscape painter was from Shanty Bay. His father founded the village. Shanty Bay also has one of Canada&#x27;s oldest &quot;Rammed Earth Construction&quot; churches, St. Thomas Anglican Church, built between 1838 and 1841 and dedicated in 1842. The Church was officially opened on February 27, 1842

In 1866–67, a drill-shed was erected in East Oro by the Oro Company, 35th Battalion the Simcoe Foresters. At this time when the Fenian raids were alarming the country, eight company drill-sheds were built in Simcoe County, the county paying $390 and the government $250 for each. The company was manned by pioneer men of Oro. Local Wm.E. O&#x27;Brien of Shanty Bay became Lieutenant Colonel of the Battalion in 1882. This East Oro drill-shed served Oro Company until the start of the 20th century and was dismantled around 1918.

The Toronto, Simcoe and Muskoka Junction Railway was built through the area in 1871. Its route was roughly parallel to the lakeshore, passing through Shanty Bay, Oro Station, and Hawkestone. An extensive station complex evolved at Hawkestone, with a freight shed, stockyards and a massive water tower to supply the requirements of the steam locomotives. The railway was incorporated as a company in 1869 as an extension connecting the Northern Railway of Canada to the Muskoka region and Lake Muskoka, and eventually reached Gravenhurst in 1875. However, financial problems led to increasing integration and eventual merger under the Northern Railway of Canada, which itself went through numerous mergers, becoming part of the Grand Trunk and, later, the Canadian National Railways. In the Canadian National (CN) system, the line through Oro was a part of the Newmarket Subdivision. The section of the line through the township was abandoned in 1996.

A branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway was built through Craighurst in the early 20th century, opening from Bolton to Craighurst in November 1906, when a station was opened. On July 19, 1907, the track was extended to Bala and by June 1908, the line was completed to Sudbury. This is now the MacTier Subdivision, a part of the railway&#x27;s main line between the east and west.

Edgar was the site of a cold war radar station from 1952 to 1964.

In 1959, the Ukrainian National Federation (UNF) purchased the &quot;Pugsley Farm&quot; property located on the East half of Lot 23 and Lot 24 in Hawkestone. The were developed into a large recreation area and children&#x27;s camp where members of the UNF and their families have spent their summers on the shores of Lake Simcoe. A portion of the property was subdivided into 100 lots of and sold to members of the UNF who built summer homes and cottages adjacent to the UNF. The entire property was named &quot;Sokil&quot;, which is the Ukrainian word for &quot;Hawk&quot; in reference to the village of Hawkestone where the community was established. Today the private subdivision is maintained by the UNF, which manages the non-municipal water system, roads and other related issues as well as the recreation area and children&#x27;s camp, where three children&#x27;s summer camps run throughout the summer, along with weekend overnight camping area, seasonal cabin rentals and a seasonal trailer park. The property also hosts the St. John the Baptist Ukrainian Catholic chapel where services are conducted each Sunday throughout the summer season.

===Black history===

In 1819, a landmark decision was made in Fort York (now Toronto) to grant land to Black militiamen of Captain Runchey&#x27;s Company of Coloured Men on an equal basis as it would be granted to Whites. The land designated for Black settlement was in Oro Township. Within a few years all Blacks of any origin could acquire land in Oro Township on an equal basis as any other settler.

There was a military strategy behind the decision. Settlers would provide support for the fort at Penetanguishene by providing food and other local supplies, and, if the war with the U.S. again broke out, the trained militiamen could be armed to defend the region.

Although for years folklore suggested that the Oro Black Settlement was populated by escaped slaves coming to Oro via the underground railroad (UGRR), documentation suggests all Black settlers were freemen. Further, the 1819 settlement preceded by about a decade what is commonly consider the beginning of the UGRR.

The blocks of land on the Penetanguishene Road, were at the time being granted to settlers of European origin. In that one or more Blacks had already established successful farms further east, a road was surveyed parallel to that road and named Wilberforce in honour of William Wilberforce, the British parliamentarian who worked so hard to abolish slavery. The Blacks were settled along this new road.

The Oro Black Settlement grew to about 90 families, then diminished as the settlers found steady income elsewhere (mainly on railway trains and ships on the Great Lakes). The last Oro Black retired to Barrie in the 1940s, and when he died, he was buried in the cemetery beside the Oro African Church.

The Oro Methodist Episcopal African Church was built out of logs by the Oro Black Settlers and was finished in 1849. It is likely the oldest log African Church still standing in North America. In 2003, it was designated a Canadian national historic site, mainly due to the link the Oro settlers had to the War of 1812. The church had fallen into disrepair, but since the summer of 2015 work has begun on restoring it.

The Battle of Burl&#x27;s Creek is the title given to the current protest and legal battle between Stan Dunford, Republic Live, The Municipal Government of Oro-Medonte, SaveOro and The West Oro Ratepayers Association (WORA).

Burl&#x27;s Creek Event Grounds is a grounds located on the south side of Highway 11 on Oro-Medonte&#x27;s 8th Line. It was established in 1994 by Don Hanney, a local businessman, as an event grounds to host small country events such as agricultural fairs, farmers&#x27; markets and Highland games. Burl&#x27;s Creek has also hosted events like the Barrie Auto Flea Market. In 2015 Burl&#x27;s Creek Event Grounds was sold to Dunford, as well as many other adjacent lots totaling 560 acres. Dunford started to develop the land to make way for a much larger event park.

Several residents of Oro-Medonte have communicated their concerns with the Township Council and have joined together under the organization of SaveOro. In the spring of 2015 the township council passed temporary bylaws that would allow Burl&#x27;s Creek Event Grounds to use the 560-acre site for camping and parking, but the bylaw was rescinded by council but not before SaveOro had filed a court application. According to Deputy Mayor Ralph Hough, &quot;there was a process in the planning act that we missed so it was never legal&quot;.

The venue was scheduled to use the 560 acres for two concerts in the summer of 2015: Wayhome Music Festival featuring Neil Young and Boots and Hearts Music Festival. The temporary bylaw was rescinded and so the concerts remained on the original 94 acres. As of July 26, 2015, the current struggle was continuing between all of the parties.

As of June 2023, this festival has been held in Oro-Medonte in consecutive years since moving from the Bowmanville Area, with a show planned for August 10–13. The event was cancelled in both 2020 &amp; 2021 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

==Recreation==
In September 1996, the last Canadian National train passed through the township. In 1998, the land used for the railway was acquired by city council for a shared-use recreational trail stretching from Barrie to Orillia. Sections are used in the winter season by the Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs.

Bass Lake Provincial Park and the Copeland Forest Resources Management Area are located within the township. Three major ski resorts, Mount St. Louis Moonstone, Horseshoe Resort, and Hardwood Ski and Bike, are also located within Oro-Medonte.

==Transportation==
===Roads===
Highway 400, Highway 11 and Highway 12 pass through Oro-Medonte. Penetanguishene Road, a historic colonization road and a former part of Highway 93, defines most of Oro-Medonte&#x27;s boundary with the neighbouring township of Springwater.

===Railways===
The Toronto, Simcoe and Muskoka Junction Railway (TS&amp;MJ) was formed in 1869. Its line headed northeast from a junction at Allandale (now part of Barrie), curving around the tip of Lake Simcoe and passing through the townships which would eventually become Oro-Medonte on its way to Orillia, Washago, and ultimately Gravenhurst. Construction began in 1870, and in 1871 the company was leased to the Northern Railway of Canada and operated as a wholly owned subsidiary thereafter. Service began along the line later that year, with the first known railway station in the township being located at Hawkestone. A basic wooden station building was constructed in 1871, with more outbuildings constructed later. The Northern Railway of Canada would engage in a number of upgrades to the line throughout the early 1870s, such as the extension from Washago to Gravenhurst, as well as conversion of the line from Provincial gauge to the standard gauge. In 1875, the line was incorporated into the Northern Railway of Canada and became its Muskoka Branch.

The Northern Railway of Canada was purchased in 1888 by the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR), which in turn undertook improvements such as building a stockyard at Shanty Bay, followed by a passenger station and stable in 1898. At Hawkestone, the Grand Trunk renovated the existing station in 1900 as well as constructing a large stockyard in 1905. In 1917, not long before the Grand Trunk&#x27;s amalgamation into Canadian National Railways (CN Rail), one of its trains derailed in front of Hawkestone station. Soon after, the line came under Canadian National ownership and formed a component of its Newmarket Subdivision.

The Great Depression saw a slump in rail traffic, and by the mid-1930s, the new owners of the line, CN Rail, had begun to strip back service. The station agent at Hawkestone was removed and replaced with a caretaker in 1936. In 1963–64, CN made a number of abrupt cuts to service, cancelling all service to Shanty Bay and Oro Station, and putting the station building at Hawkestone up for sale. Hawkestone still appeared intermittently on CN train timetables for the next few years, but disappeared for the last time in 1968. The station building was demolished around 1969. Canada&#x27;s Board of Transport Commissioners had contacted the Township of Oro in 1964 asking if it objected to the removal of Oro&#x27;s station, but no reply from the township is on file, and the station was demolished in 1966. Carthew also disappeared from timetables in 1973.

Despite the elimination of passenger service in the township, CN passenger and freight trains continued to travel along the line on their way to Orillia. This would continue with the consolidation of passenger services under Via Rail. In 1995, CN successfully applied to the Canadian Transport Commission to abandon the line. The last passenger train to travel the line was Via Rail No. 1 in 1996, the &quot;Canadian&quot;, headed west to Vancouver. By the end of the year, the line north of Barrie was abandoned, along with Via Rail service to Barrie and Orillia, and the route of the &quot;Canadian&quot; was shifted to the east shore of Lake Simcoe, to follow the CN Bala Subdivision through Washago. This ended over 125 years of railway operations and history in the township. Today, the former right of way of the rail line has been converted into the Oro-Medonte Rail Trail, a recreational multi-use trail.

===Bus===
Starting in August 2019, public transit service returned to Oro-Medonte when Simcoe County LINX Route 3 began operations, connecting Barrie to Orillia along Highway 11, with a single stop in the township at the Lake Simcoe Regional Airport in Oro Station. Ontario Northland intercity motor coaches also travel along the Highway 11 corridor, but travel express through the township and make no stops.

===Air===
The Lake Simcoe Regional Airport is located in the township near the community of Guthrie.

<doc id="622051" wikidata="Q242705" url="?curid=622051" title="Pauline Collins">
<text>Pauline Collins (born 3 September 1940) is a British actress who first came to prominence portraying Sarah Moffat in &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; (1971–1973) and its spin-off &quot;Thomas &amp; Sarah&quot; (1979). In 1992, she published her autobiography &quot;Letter to Louise&quot;.

Collins played the title role in the play &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; for which she won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress, and the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. She reprised the role in the 1989 film adaptation of the play, winning the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and receiving a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She also starred in the television dramas &quot;Forever Green&quot; (1989–1992) and &quot;The Ambassador&quot; (1998–1999). Her other film appearances include &quot;City of Joy&quot; (1992), &quot;Paradise Road&quot; (1997), &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot; (2011), &quot;Quartet&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Time of Their Lives&quot; (2017).

==Early life and career==
Collins was born in Exmouth, Devon, the daughter of Mary Honora (née Callanan), a schoolteacher, and William Henry Collins, a school headmaster. She is of Irish extraction, and was brought up as a Catholic in Wallasey, Cheshire. Her great-uncle was Irish poet Jeremiah Joseph Callanan.

Collins was educated at Sacred Heart High School and studied at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. Before turning to acting, she worked as a teacher until 1962. She made her stage debut at Windsor in &quot;A Gazelle in Park Lane&quot; in 1962 and her West End debut in &quot;Passion Flower Hotel&quot; in 1965. During the play&#x27;s run, she made her first film, titled &quot;Secrets of a Windmill Girl&quot;, released in 1966. More stage roles followed.

Collins played Samantha Briggs in the 1967 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot; and was offered the chance to continue in the series as a new companion for the Doctor, but declined the role.

Other early TV credits include the UK&#x27;s first medical soap &quot;Emergency Ward 10&quot; (1960), and the pilot episode and first series of &quot;The Liver Birds&quot;, both in 1969.

Collins first became well-known for her role as the maid Sarah in the 1970s drama series &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;. The character appeared regularly throughout the first two series, the second of which starred her actor husband John Alderton, with whom she later starred in the spin-off &quot;Thomas &amp; Sarah&quot; (1979); the sitcom &quot;No, Honestly&quot;, written by Terence Brady and Charlotte Bingham; and a series of short-story adaptations titled &quot;Wodehouse Playhouse&quot; (1975–1978). She co-narrated the animated British children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Little Miss&quot; with Alderton in 1983.

In connection with her role on &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;, Collins recorded the 1973 single &quot;What Are We Going to Do with Uncle Arthur?&quot; (performed by her character several times during the series) backed with &quot;With Every Passing Day&quot; (a vocal version of the show&#x27;s theme).

She was a subject of the television programme &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in April 1972, when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

==&quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; and recent years==
In 1988, Collins starred in the one-woman play &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot; in London, reprising the role on Broadway in 1989 and in the 1989 film version. The film won a number of awards and nominations; Collins was nominated for the Oscar as Best Actress and won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical. Both the play and the feature film used the technique known as breaking the fourth wall as the character Shirley Valentine directly addresses the audience throughout the story.

After &quot;Shirley Valentine&quot;, Collins starred with her husband in the popular ITV drama series &quot;Forever Green&quot;, created and written by Terence Brady and Charlotte Bingham in which the fictitious couple escape the city with their children to start a new life in the country. It ran from 1989 to 1992 over 18 episodes. Collins was voted sexiest woman in Britain in 1990.

Collins&#x27; film credits include 1992&#x27;s &quot;City of Joy&quot;, 1995&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Road&quot;, and 2002&#x27;s &quot;Mrs Caldicot&#x27;s Cabbage War&quot;, which also featured Alderton. In 1999 and 2000, Collins starred as Harriet Smith in the BBC television drama &quot;Ambassador&quot;. Other television credits include &quot;The Saint&quot;, &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot;, &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;, &quot;Play for Today&quot;, &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;, &quot;Country Matters&quot;, and &quot;The Black Tower&quot;.

In 2002, she guest-starred in &quot;Man and Boy&quot;, the dramatisation of Tony Parsons&#x27; best-seller. In 2005, she appeared as Miss Flite in the BBC production of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Bleak House&quot;.

In 2006, she became the third actor to have been in both the original and new series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, appearing in the episode &quot;Tooth and Claw&quot; as Queen Victoria.

Later in 2006, she appeared in &quot;Extinct&quot;, a programme where eight celebrities campaigned on behalf of an animal to save it from extinction. Collins campaigned to save the Bengal tiger and won the public vote.

In December 2007, she appeared as the fairy godmother in the pantomime &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Old Vic in London.

In 2011, she was cast as part of the comedy-drama &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot;. She played the role of Sue, Lisa&#x27;s mother, in the first two series running into 2012. She did not return to the third series in 2013, and her character was killed off in the fourth series in 2014.

In late 2015, she appeared as Mrs Gamp in the BBC TV series &quot;Dickensian&quot;.

Collins was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2001 Birthday Honours for services to drama.

==Personal life==
Collins married actor John Alderton in 1969 and lives in Hampstead, London with her husband and their three children Nicholas, Kate, and Richard. She also has an older daughter, Louise, with actor Tony Rohr. Collins gave Louise up for adoption in 1964 when she was a penniless single mother. They were reunited when Louise was 22 years old. Collins&#x27;s book, &quot;Letter To Louise&quot;, documents these events.

<text>In physics, the &quot;S&quot;-matrix or scattering matrix is a matrix that relates the initial state and the final state of a physical system undergoing a scattering process. It is used in quantum mechanics, scattering theory and quantum field theory (QFT).

More formally, in the context of QFT, the &quot;S&quot;-matrix is defined as the unitary matrix connecting sets of asymptotically free particle states (the &quot;in-states&quot; and the &quot;out-states&quot;) in the Hilbert space of physical states: a multi-particle state is said to be &quot;free&quot; (or non-interacting) if it transforms under Lorentz transformations as a tensor product, or &quot;direct product&quot; in physics parlance, of &quot;one-particle states&quot; as prescribed by equation below. &quot;Asymptotically free&quot; then means that the state has this appearance in either the distant past or the distant future.

While the &quot;S&quot;-matrix may be defined for any background (spacetime) that is asymptotically solvable and has no event horizons, it has a simple form in the case of the Minkowski space. In this special case, the Hilbert space is a space of irreducible unitary representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group (the Poincaré group); the &quot;S&quot;-matrix is the evolution operator between formula_1 (the distant past), and formula_2 (the distant future). It is defined only in the limit of zero energy density (or infinite particle separation distance).

It can be shown that if a quantum field theory in Minkowski space has a mass gap, the state in the asymptotic past and in the asymptotic future are both described by Fock spaces.

==History==
The initial elements of &quot;S&quot;-matrix theory are found in Paul Dirac&#x27;s 1927 paper &quot;Über die Quantenmechanik der Stoßvorgänge&quot;. The &quot;S&quot;-matrix was first properly introduced by John Archibald Wheeler in the 1937 paper &quot;On the Mathematical Description of Light Nuclei by the Method of Resonating Group Structure&quot;. In this paper Wheeler introduced a &quot;scattering matrix&quot; – a unitary matrix of coefficients connecting &quot;the asymptotic behaviour of an arbitrary particular solution [of the integral equations] with that of solutions of a standard form&quot;, but did not develop it fully.

In the 1940s, Werner Heisenberg independently developed and substantiated the idea of the &quot;S&quot;-matrix. Because of the problematic divergences present in quantum field theory at that time, Heisenberg was motivated to isolate the &quot;essential features of the theory&quot; that would not be affected by future changes as the theory developed. In doing so, he was led to introduce a unitary &quot;characteristic&quot; &quot;S&quot;-matrix.

Today, however, exact &quot;S&quot;-matrix results are important for conformal field theory, integrable systems, and several further areas of quantum field theory and string theory. &quot;S&quot;-matrices are not substitutes for a field-theoretic treatment, but rather, complement the end results of such.

==Motivation==

In high-energy particle physics one is interested in computing the probability for different outcomes in scattering experiments. These experiments can be broken down into three stages:

# Making a collection of incoming particles collide (usually two kinds of particles with high energies).
# Allowing the incoming particles to interact. These interactions may change the types of particles present (e.g. if an electron and a positron annihilate they may produce two photons).
# Measuring the resulting outgoing particles.

The process by which the incoming particles are transformed (through their interaction) into the outgoing particles is called scattering. For particle physics, a physical theory of these processes must be able to compute the probability for different outgoing particles when different incoming particles collide with different energies.

The &quot;S&quot;-matrix in quantum field theory achieves exactly this. It is assumed that the small-energy-density approximation is valid in these cases.

==Use==

The &quot;S&quot;-matrix is closely related to the transition probability amplitude in quantum mechanics and to cross sections of various interactions; the elements (individual numerical entries) in the &quot;S&quot;-matrix are known as scattering amplitudes. Poles of the &quot;S&quot;-matrix in the complex-energy plane are identified with bound states, virtual states or resonances. Branch cuts of the &quot;S&quot;-matrix in the complex-energy plane are associated to the opening of a scattering channel.

In the Hamiltonian approach to quantum field theory, the &quot;S&quot;-matrix may be calculated as a time-ordered exponential of the integrated Hamiltonian in the interaction picture; it may also be expressed using Feynman&#x27;s path integrals. In both cases, the perturbative calculation of the &quot;S&quot;-matrix leads to Feynman diagrams.

In scattering theory, the &quot;S&quot;-matrix is an operator mapping free particle &quot;in-states&quot; to free particle &quot;out-states&quot; (scattering channels) in the Heisenberg picture. This is very useful because often we cannot describe the interaction (at least, not the most interesting ones) exactly.

==In one-dimensional quantum mechanics==
A simple prototype in which the &quot;S&quot;-matrix is 2-dimensional is considered first, for the purposes of illustration. In it, particles with sharp energy scatter from a localized potential according to the rules of 1-dimensional quantum mechanics. Already this simple model displays some features of more general cases, but is easier to handle.

Each energy yields a matrix that depends on . Thus, the total &quot;S&quot;-matrix could, figuratively speaking, be visualized, in a suitable basis, as a &quot;continuous matrix&quot; with every element zero except for -blocks along the diagonal for a given .

===Definition===
Consider a localized one dimensional potential barrier , subjected to a beam of quantum particles with energy . These particles are incident on the potential barrier from left to right.

The solutions of Schrödinger&#x27;s equation outside the potential barrier are plane waves given by
formula_3
for the region to the left of the potential barrier, and
formula_4
for the region to the right to the potential barrier, where
formula_5
is the wave vector. The time dependence is not needed in our overview and is hence omitted. The term with coefficient represents the incoming wave, whereas term with coefficient represents the outgoing wave. stands for the reflecting wave. Since we set the incoming wave moving in the positive direction (coming from the left), is zero and can be omitted.

The &quot;scattering amplitude&quot;, i.e., the transition overlap of the outgoing waves with the incoming waves is a linear relation defining the &quot;S&quot;-matrix,
formula_6

The above relation can be written as
formula_7
where
formula_8
The elements of completely characterize the scattering properties of the potential barrier .

===Unitary property===
The unitary property of the &quot;S&quot;-matrix is directly related to the conservation of the probability current in quantum mechanics.

The probability current density of the wave function is defined as
formula_9
The probability current density formula_10 of formula_11 to the left of the barrier is
formula_12
while the probability current density formula_13 of formula_14 to the right of the barrier is
formula_15

For conservation of the probability current, . This implies the &quot;S&quot;-matrix is a unitary matrix.

===Time-reversal symmetry===
If the potential is real, then the system possesses time-reversal symmetry. Under this condition, if is a solution of Schrödinger&#x27;s equation, then is also a solution.

The time-reversed solution is given by
formula_16
for the region to the left to the potential barrier, and
formula_17
for the region to the right to the potential barrier,
where the terms with coefficient , represent incoming wave, and terms with coefficient , represent outgoing wave.

They are again related by the &quot;S&quot;-matrix,
formula_18
that is,
formula_19
Now, the relations
formula_20
together yield a condition
formula_21
This condition, in conjunction with the unitarity relation, implies that the &quot;S&quot;-matrix is symmetric, as a result of time reversal symmetry,
formula_22

By combining the symmetry and the unitarity, the S-matrix can be expressed in the form:
formula_23 
with formula_24 and formula_25. So the S-matrix is determined by three real parameters.

==== Transfer matrix ====
The &quot;transfer matrix&quot; formula_26 relates the plane waves formula_27 and formula_28 on the &quot;right&quot; side of scattering potential to the plane waves formula_29 and formula_30 on the &quot;left&quot; side: 

formula_31 and its components can be derived from the components of the S-matrix via: formula_32 and formula_33, whereby time-reversal symmetry is assumed.

In the case of time-reversal symmetry, the transfer matrix formula_34 can be expressed by three real parameters:

formula_35 
with formula_24 and formula_25 (in case there would be no connection between the left and the right side)

==== Finite square well ====
The one-dimensional, non-relativistic problem with time-reversal symmetry of a particle with mass m that approaches a (static) finite square &quot;well&quot;, has the potential function with
formula_38
The scattering can be solved by decomposing the wave packet of the free particle into plane waves formula_39 with wave numbers formula_40 for a plane wave coming (faraway) from the left side or likewise formula_41 (faraway) from the right side.

The S-matrix for the plane wave with wave number has the solution:
formula_42
and formula_43 ; hence formula_44 and therefore formula_45 and formula_46 in this case.

Whereby formula_47 is the (increased) wave number of the plane wave inside the square well, as the energy eigenvalue formula_48 associated with the plane wave has to stay constant: formula_49

The transmission is formula_50

In the case of formula_51 then formula_52 and therefore formula_53 and formula_54 i.e. a plane wave with wave number k passes the well without reflection if formula_55 for a formula_56

==== Finite square barrier ====
The square &quot;barrier&quot; is similar to the square well with the difference that formula_57 for formula_58.

There are three different cases depending on the energy eigenvalue formula_59 of the plane waves (with wave numbers resp. ) far away from the barrier:
&lt;/math&gt; and the formulas for formula_60 have the same form as is in the square well case, and the transmission is formula_61

| formula_62: In this case formula_63 and the wave function formula_64 has the property formula_65 inside the barrier and

formula_66 and formula_67

The transmission is: formula_68. This intermediate case is not singular, it&#x27;s the limit (formula_69 resp. formula_70) from both sides.

| formula_71:In this case formula_72 is an imaginary number. So the wave function inside the barrier has the components formula_73 and formula_74 with formula_75. 

The solution for the S-matrix is: formula_76 

and likewise: formula_77 and also in this case formula_46.

The transmission is formula_79.

===Transmission coefficient and reflection coefficient===
The transmission coefficient from the left of the potential barrier is, when ,
formula_80
so the in and out states sought after are eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian that are necessarily non-interacting due to the absence of mixed particle energy terms. The discussion in the section above suggests that the in states and the out states should be such that
formula_81
for large positive and negative has the appearance of the corresponding package, represented by , of free-particle states, assumed smooth and suitably localized in momentum. Wave packages are necessary, else the time evolution will yield only a phase factor indicating free particles, which cannot be the case. The right hand side follows from that the in and out states are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian per above. To formalize this requirement, assume that the full Hamiltonian can be divided into two terms, a free-particle Hamiltonian and an interaction , such that the eigenstates of have the same appearance as the in- and out-states with respect to normalization and Lorentz transformation properties,
formula_82
formula_83

The in and out states are defined as eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian,
formula_84
satisfying
formula_85
for or respectively. Define
formula_86
then
formula_87
This last expression will work only using wave packages.From these definitions follow that the in and out states are normalized in the same way as the free-particle states,
formula_88
and the three sets are unitarily equivalent. Now rewrite the eigenvalue equation,
formula_89
where the terms has been added to make the operator on the LHS invertible. Since the in and out states reduce to the free-particle states for , put
formula_90
on the RHS to obtain
formula_91
Then use the completeness of the free-particle states,
formula_92
to finally obtain
formula_93
Here has been replaced by its eigenvalue on the free-particle states. This is the Lippmann–Schwinger equation.

====In states expressed as out states====
The initial states can be expanded in a basis of final states (or vice versa). Using the completeness relation,
formula_94
formula_95
where is the probability that the interaction transforms
formula_96
into
formula_97
By the ordinary rules of quantum mechanics,
formula_98
and one may write
formula_99
The expansion coefficients are precisely the &quot;S&quot;-matrix elements to be defined below.

===The &quot;S&quot;-matrix===
The &quot;S&quot;-matrix is now defined by
formula_100

Here and are shorthands that represent the particle content but suppresses the individual labels. Associated to the &quot;S&quot;-matrix there is the S-operator defined by
formula_101

where the are free particle states. This definition conforms with the direct approach used in the interaction picture. Also, due to unitary equivalence,
formula_102

As a physical requirement, must be a unitary operator. This is a statement of conservation of probability in quantum field theory. But
formula_103
By completeness then,
formula_104
so &quot;S&quot; is the unitary transformation from in-states to out states.
Lorentz invariance is another crucial requirement on the &quot;S&quot;-matrix. The S-operator represents the quantum canonical transformation of the initial &quot;in&quot; states to the final &quot;out&quot; states. Moreover, leaves the vacuum state invariant and transforms &quot;in&quot;-space fields to &quot;out&quot;-space fields,
formula_105
formula_106

In terms of creation and annihilation operators, this becomes
formula_107
hence
formula_108
A similar expression holds when operates to the left on an out state. This means that the &quot;S&quot;-matrix can be expressed as
formula_109

If describes an interaction correctly, these properties must be also true:
* If the system is made up with &quot;a single particle&quot; in momentum eigenstate , then . This follows from the calculation above as a special case.
* The &quot;S&quot;-matrix element may be nonzero only where the output state has the same total momentum as the input state. This follows from the required Lorentz invariance of the &quot;S&quot;-matrix.

==Evolution operator &quot;U&quot;==
Define a time-dependent creation and annihilation operator as follows,
formula_110
so, for the fields,
formula_111
where
formula_112

We allow for a phase difference, given by
formula_113
because for ,
formula_114

Substituting the explicit expression for , one has
formula_115
where formula_116 is the interaction part of the Hamiltonian and formula_117 is the time ordering.

By inspection, it can be seen that this formula is not explicitly covariant.

==Dyson series==

The most widely used expression for the &quot;S&quot;-matrix is the Dyson series. This expresses the &quot;S&quot;-matrix operator as the series:

formula_118

where:
* formula_119 denotes time-ordering,
* formula_120 denotes the interaction Hamiltonian density which describes the interactions in the theory.

== The not-&quot;S&quot;-matrix ==
Since the transformation of particles from black hole to Hawking radiation could not be described with an &quot;S&quot;-matrix, Stephen Hawking proposed a &quot;not-&quot;S&quot;-matrix&quot;, for which he used the dollar sign ($), and which therefore was also called &quot;dollar matrix&quot;.

<text>George Hartley McQuinn (May 29, 1910 – December 24, 1978) was an American professional baseball player. He played as a first baseman in Major League Baseball from to , most notably as a member of the only St. Louis Browns team to win an American League pennant in and, as a member of the world champion New York Yankees. A seven-time All-Star, he threw and batted left-handed.

==Early life==
McQuinn was born in Arlington, Virginia, and attended Washington-Lee High School.

==Baseball career==

During his 12-year MLB playing career, McQuinn played for the Cincinnati Reds (1936), St. Louis Browns (1938–45), Philadelphia Athletics (1946) and New York Yankees (1947–48). He was selected for the American League All-Star team six times (MLB cancelled the 1945 All-Star Game and no All-Stars were named that season).

In 1938, McQuinn had a .324 career-high batting average with 12 home runs, 42 doubles, 100 runs and 82 runs batted in (RBIs). In 1939, his batting average was .316 with 101 runs scored, 94 RBIs, 37 doubles, 13 triples and 20 home runs. The following year he had 39 doubles, 10 triples and 16 home runs. In 1944, his opening-game home run gave the Browns their first victory and was their only home run in a World Series game.

In 1947, at the age of 36, McQuinn hit .304 with 13 home runs and 80 RBIs, and was nominated for the MVP Award. He retired at the end of the 1948 season at the age of 38.

McQuinn had a career batting average of .276, and a total of 135 home runs and 794 RBIs in 1,550 games. He recorded a .992 fielding percentage playing every inning of his major league career at first base. After retiring, he was a manager for the Quebec Braves in the farm system of the Boston/Milwaukee Braves, and scouted for the Washington Senators and Montreal Expos.

He was inducted into the Arlington Sports Hall of Fame in 1958 and the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1978. He died of a stroke in an Alexandria, Virginia hospital, at the age 68 on December 24, 1978.

<doc id="622061" wikidata="Q510052" url="?curid=622061" title="Moroccan Western Sahara Wall">
<text>The Moroccan Western Sahara Wall or the Berm, also called the Moroccan sand wall (), is an approximately berm running south to north through Western Sahara and the southwestern portion of Morocco. It separates the Moroccan-controlled areas (the Southern Provinces) on the west from the Polisario-controlled areas (Free Zone, nominally Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic) on the east. The main function of the barriers is to exclude guerrilla fighters of the Polisario Front, who have sought Western Saharan independence since before Spain ended its colonial occupation in 1975, from the Moroccan-controlled western part of the territory.

According to maps from the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) or the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in some places the wall extends several kilometers into internationally recognized Mauritanian territory.

==Names==
The wall is also called the Western Sahara berm and the Western Sahara separation barrier.

==Physical structure==
The fortifications lie in uninhabited or very sparsely inhabited territory. They consist of sand and stone walls or berms about in height, with bunkers, fences, and landmines throughout. The barrier minebelt that runs along the structure is thought to be the longest continuous minefield in the world. Military bases, artillery posts and airfields dot the Moroccan-controlled side of the wall at regular intervals, and radar masts and other electronic surveillance equipment scan the areas in front of it.

The following is one observer&#x27;s description of the berm from 2001:
In all, six lines of berms have been constructed. The main (&quot;external&quot;) line of fortifications extends for about . It runs east from Guerguerat on the coast in the extreme south of Western Sahara near the Mauritanian town of Nouadhibou, closely parallelling the Mauritanian border for about , before turning north beyond Tichla. It then runs generally northeastward, leaving Guelta Zemmur and Smara, again crossing Mauritanian territory and reaching Haouza in Moroccan-held territory, before turning east and again closely following the Algerian border as it approaches Morocco. A section extends about into southeastern Morocco.

Significant lines of fortifications also lie deep within the Moroccan-controlled area. Their exact number and location have been ignored and not well understood until 2004 by international commentators.

All major settlements in Western Sahara, the capital Laayoune, and the phosphate mine at Bou Craa lie far into the Moroccan-held side.

==History==
=== Construction ===

The fortifications were progressively built by Moroccan forces starting in 1980, with help from South African, South Korean, and Israeli advisors, and formally ending on 16 April 1987. The wall was built in six stages, and the area behind the wall was expanded from a small area near Morocco in the north to most of the western and central part of the country gradually. The walls built were:

*1st wall (August 1980 – June 1982) surrounding the &quot;useful triangle&quot; of El Aaiún, Smara, and the phosphate mines at Bou Craa, built with the help of South African military engineers and Portuguese and French renegade mercenaries (c. ).
*2nd wall (December 1983 – January 1984) surrounding Amgala (c. ).
*3rd wall (April 1984 – May 1984) surrounding Jdiriya and Haouza (c. ).
*4th wall (December 1984 – January 1985) surrounding Mahbes and Farciya (c. ).
*5th wall (May–September 1985) surrounding Guelta Zemmur, Bir Anzarane, and Dakhla, again with the help of South African and Israeli experts (c. )
*6th wall (February–April 1987) surrounding Auserd, Tichla, and Bir Ganduz (c. ).
*7th wall (November–December 2020) from 6th wall to Mauritanian frontier (c. ).

=== 2005 expulsion incident ===

In the summer of 2005, the Moroccan Army accelerated the expulsion (begun in late 2004) of illegal immigrants detained in northern Morocco to the eastern side of the wall, into the Free Zone. The Polisario Front and the MINURSO rescued several dozen lost in the desert, who had run out of water. Others died of thirst. By October, the Polisario had received 22 immigrants in Mehaires, 46 in Tifariti and 97 in Bir Lehlu. They were from African countries (Gambia, Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana, etc.), except a group of 48 who were from Bangladesh.

===The Thousand Column demonstration===
Since 2008, a demonstration called &quot;The Thousand Column&quot; is held annually in the desert against the barrier by international human rights activists and Sahrawi refugees. In the 2008 demonstration, more than 2,000 people (most of them Sahrawis and Spaniards, but also Algerians, Italians, and others) made a human chain demanding the demolition of the wall, the celebration of the self-determination referendum accorded by the UN and the parts in 1991, and the end of the Moroccan occupation of the territory.

During the 2009 demonstration, a teenage Sahrawi refugee named Ibrahim Hussein Leibeit lost half of his right leg in a landmine explosion. The incident happened when Leibeit and dozens of young Sahrawis crossed the line into a minefield while aiming to throw stones to the other side of the wall.

== Effect ==
Effectively, after the completion of the wall, Morocco has controlled the bulk of Western Sahara territory that lies to the north and west of it, calling these the kingdom&#x27;s &quot;Southern Provinces&quot;. The Polisario-founded Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic controls the mostly uninhabited &quot;Free Zone&quot;, which comprises all areas to the east of the barrier. Units from the United Nations mission MINURSO separate the two sides, and enforce cease-fire regulations.

==External reactions and opinions==
Western attention to the wall, and to the Moroccan annexation of Western Sahara in general, has been minimal, apart from Spain. In Africa, the annexation of Western Sahara by Morocco has attracted somewhat more attention. Algeria supports the Polisario Front &quot;in its long-running desert war to oppose Moroccan control of the disputed area&quot;. The Organization of African Unity/African Union (AU) and United Nations have proposed negotiated solutions. 

The AU&#x27;s stance on Western Sahara led to Morocco&#x27;s exit from the organization. After a 33-year absence, Morocco rejoined on 30 January 2017, despite 9 member states voting against, but 39 supporting. Morocco was re-admitted with the understanding that Western Sahara will remain an AU member.

<text>Keith James Locke (15 April 1944 – 21 June 2024) was a New Zealand activist and politician. He was a Green Party Member of Parliament from 1999 to 2011.

==Early life and family==
Locke was born on 15 April 1944 in Christchurch and grew up in that city. His parents were Jack and Elsie Locke, prominent lifelong political activists for a wide variety of causes. Their four children were brought up in this environment and followed their parents into a life of activism. His sister Maire Leadbeater is a well-known activist and former city councillor for Auckland City Council). His father Jack was under surveillance during the 1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute.

Former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon is said to have described the Lockes as the most &quot;notorious Communist family in New Zealand&quot;. The Lockes lived in the Avon Loop area of the Christchurch Central City and were very active in the community, notably organising native tree plantings and clean-ups of the Avon River / Ōtākaro. They also argued against development of the area in favour of retaining the character of the area.

Locke attended Christchurch Boys&#x27; High School and received a BSc in psychology from the University of Canterbury, where he was active in the New Left Club. He went to Canada for a master&#x27;s degree in sociology at the University of Alberta.

== Career and early political activism ==
Returning to New Zealand from Canada, Locke lectured in sociology at Victoria University of Wellington from 1970 to 1972. He left academia to work as a full-time editor of the fortnightly socialist paper &quot;Socialist Action&quot; from 1972 to 1977. From 1979 to 1986, he worked as an active socialist and unionist in a car factory, railway workshops and meatworks in the Wellington region. In 1985, he moved to Auckland, working in the Auckland City abattoirs, 1985–86. From 1986 to 1990, Locke worked full-time as the national coordinator of the Philippines Solidarity Network, based in Auckland. From 1990 to 1999, he was manager of One World Books, a non-profit bookshop in Auckland specialising in social, environmental and development issues.

Politically active all his life, Locke joined the Socialist Action League (SAL) in 1970. By 1972, he was both the National Secretary of the SAL and chairman of &quot;Socialists for Labour&quot;. By 1985, Locke had left the SAL but was still involved in various issue movements. These included Latin America, the Philippines and East Timor solidarity movements and the anti-nuclear movement. Locke was a pacifist and was critical of violent left-wing activism in Quebec and Uruguay as &quot;counterproductive&quot;.

In 1989, Jim Anderton broke away from the Labour Party to form the NewLabour Party (NLP). Locke, as well as several other former SAL members, were given roles in the NLP&#x27;s first National Council. Locke was appointed to be NLP foreign affairs and defence spokesperson and stood as the NLP candidate for in the 1990 election, where he finished fourth.

In December 1991, the NLP joined with the Green Party, Mana Motuhake and the Democrats to form the Alliance Party. Locke continued as foreign affairs spokesperson for the Alliance and stood in Eden in the 1993 election, finishing third, and in the 1996 election, finishing fourth. He was ranked 24 on the Alliance party list in the 1996 election. Locke was not elected and, after the election, was forced to relinquish his role as foreign affairs spokesman to list MP Matt Robson. 

By 1997, Locke was critical of the Alliance, saying that Anderton&#x27;s offer to the Labour Party of working together in a future coalition government would help only Labour and not the Alliance, and that it would be better for the Alliance to &quot;carve out its critical space on the left.&quot; The same year, the Green Party decided to leave the Alliance. Locke opted to join the Green Party and became its foreign affairs spokesperson. 

== Member of Parliament ==


Locke stood as a Green Party candidate in the 1999 election and was elected as a list MP, ranked seventh on the party list. Locke&#x27;s election as the final Green list MP, at the expense of Labour, deprived the Labour–Alliance government of a majority but the Green Party agreed to provide confidence and supply to the government. Locke was returned to Parliament as a list MP in the 2002, 2005 and 2008 elections. In the latter three elections, he stood unsuccessfully in the Epsom electorate.

Through his twelve-year parliamentary career, Locke was the Green Party spokesperson for foreign affairs, defence, immigration and disarmament, and a member of the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee. He was also a Green Party spokesperson for state services, police, security, human rights, and Auckland transport.

In 2000, Locke had two member&#x27;s bills drawn from the ballot. The first, the Intelligence and Security Committee Act Repeal Bill, attempted to reform oversight of the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service and Government Communications Security Bureau. It was defeated at its first reading. The second, the International Treaties Bill, attempted to give greater parliamentary oversight of treaty-making. It was sent to select committee, but ultimately defeated at its second reading in 2003.

As a Member of Parliament, Locke established a profile of being an &quot;unofficial civil liberties watchdog&quot;. He was involved in campaigns against the New Zealand Police being armed with Taser guns, and repeal of the law of sedition. He advocated for refugee rights, most prominently in the drawn-out case of Ahmed Zaoui, an Algerian asylum seeker initially deemed by the New Zealand government to be a security risk, but later allowed to settle in New Zealand with his family. During his time in Parliament Locke was a leading critic of New Zealand&#x27;s anti-terrorist legislation, such as the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002, which he argued breached human rights principles. He also opposed New Zealand&#x27;s commitment of special forces to the war in Afghanistan.

Long a critic of New Zealand&#x27;s intelligence services, in 2008, Locke received, under the Privacy Act, a copy of the file the Security Intelligence Service had kept on him from 1955, when he had been 11 years old, to 2006. This surveillance of a sitting Member of Parliament was investigated by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Paul Neazor, who then recommended that any such files be closed when a person enters Parliament.
Locke supported a New Zealand republic. In his maiden speech, Locke stated &quot;We should also break free of the British Crown and become a republic. The question is not whether the monarchy has a lot of power over us. In practice it doesn&#x27;t. The problem is that bowing before the British Queen reflects a colonial mentality.&quot; In 2002, Locke put forward the Head of State (Referenda) Bill, which if passed would have brought about a referendum on the question of whether New Zealand should become a republic. The Bill was selected for debate on 14 October 2009 but was defeated at its first reading in April 2010.

In January 2011, Locke announced that he would retire at that year&#x27;s election. He delivered his valedictory speech on 28 September 2011. With Sue Kedgley, Locke&#x27;s retirement completed the departure of the first intake of Green Party MPs from 1999.

==Honours and awards==
During his 12 years in Parliament, Locke won a number of awards. He was twice named &#x27;Backbencher of the Year&#x27;, first in 2002 by Vernon Small, then deputy political editor of &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;, and again in 2010 by &quot;The Dominion Post&quot; political staff. He also received the New Zealand Republic&#x27;s Colonel Allen Bell Award in 2011; the New Zealand Amnesty International&#x27;s Human Rights Defender Award in 2012; and the Federation of Islamic Associations for New Zealand&#x27;s Harmony Award in 2013.

In the 2021 New Year Honours, Locke was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to human rights advocacy.

==Controversies==
His political opponents referred to him during question time as &quot;Pol Pot&quot; or &quot;the Honourable Member for Cambodia&quot; due to supportive articles he wrote while editor of the New Zealand &quot;Socialist Action&quot; newspaper about the Khmer Rouge regime under the headline; &quot;Cambodia liberated: victory for humanity&quot;. Locke claimed his initial support for the Khmer Rouge was because &quot;many people thought the Khmer Rouge were an adjunct of the Vietnamese communist forces&quot; and that he thought they &quot;would be better than the regimes they replaced&quot;. He also responded that he renounced his support after hearing of their atrocities, while the New Zealand Government of the time continued to express support for the regime.

Similarly, while he opposed the 2001 war in Afghanistan to remove the Taliban, he had written an article (in &quot;Socialist Action&quot;) entitled &quot;Why workers should support Soviet action in Afghanistan&quot; in 1980. This led to accusations of hypocrisy. Locke explained that his previous support for the Soviet invasion was the position of the Socialist Action League, that he was wrong to have supported it, that he was incorrect in believing it would protect human rights in Afghanistan, and that he now believed it encouraged Islamic extremist groups.

During the 2005 election he contested the Epsom electorate in Auckland and at a public meeting he promised to run through the streets of Epsom naked if the electorate was won by ACT New Zealand&#x27;s leader Rodney Hide. Hide won the seat. &quot;I&#x27;ll do it. I have to,&quot; Locke was reported as saying. &quot;I was so confident, but I have turned out to be wrong and I have got to do it.&quot; Locke&#x27;s promise made headlines in media around the world. On Sunday 25 September 2005 Locke walked near-naked down Broadway (a main shopping street in Newmarket, Auckland) wearing shoes, socks, a G-string, and body paint. The paint camouflaged Locke&#x27;s skin by depicting a suit and tie from the neck down.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ_Herald_ww.nzherald.co.nz/author/story.cfm?a_id=74&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-parliamentary activities ==
After retiring from Parliament, Locke joined the boards of the Auckland Refugee Council and the New Zealand Peace and Conflict Studies Centre Trust. He wrote on political issues for New Zealand newspapers and the &quot;Daily Blog&quot;.

== Death ==
Locke died in Auckland on 21 June 2024, at the age of 80.

<doc id="622068" wikidata="Q3885675" url="?curid=622068" title="Sri Sathya Sai International Organization">
<text>The Sri Sathya Sai International Organization (SSSIO) is a spiritual and humanitarian non-governmental organization founded in the 1960s by Sathya Sai Baba, an Indian guru and spiritual leader. It primarily works within the areas of education and humanitarian aid, in India and internationally.

The SSSIO is an umbrella organization which runs several institutes, trusts and associations. There are 1,969 Sathya Sai Centers in 120 countries.
Sri Sathya Sai Baba&#x27;s 100th Birthday Celebrations have been commemorated by a specially designed logo created by the SSSIO. It is a humble and sincere effort to capture the uniqueness of Sri Sathya Sai Baba in this logo.

== Medical Care ==

The Organization has been conducting medical conferences and camps in various countries through its regional arms. Medical camps have been conducted every year in Fiji since 2006. In 2017, Fiji arm and the Australian arm of the Organization conducted a regional conference at the Sangam School of Nursing in Labasa where the Fijian Minister for Health and Medical Services, Rosy Akbar was the chief guest.

The SSSIO of Sri Lanka established a hospice called Sathya Sai Suva Sevana at Hanwella, 20 kilometres from the National Cancer Institute (Sri Lanka) in 2002 for providing palliative care to terminally ill cancer patients. It is funded totally by donations made voluntarily and can accommodate up to 50 inmates. A physician visits the hospice four times every week and is always available for emergency calls.

In April 2024, Prime Cabinet Secretary of Kenya, Musalia Mudavadi, appreciated the organization for conducting medical camps in Kenya.

== Education ==

The Sathya Sai International Organization has helped followers set up similar schools in other countries, with the goal of educating children in the five human values of Sathya (Truth), Dharma (Duty), Prema (Love), Shanthi (Peace) and Ahimsa (Non-Violence). Schools have been founded in 33 countries, including Australia, Mexico, United Kingdom, Kenya and Peru.

The Times of Zambia had once published: &quot;The positive influence of Sathya Sai is unprecedented in the annals of education in Zambia. Sai Baba&#x27;s education ideals as embodied in his human-values-based approach to education are enlightening to educationists in Zambia.&quot;

In Australia, at the Tweed Shire Council&#x27;s inaugural Tweed Sustainability Awards (2019), the SSSIO&#x27;s Sathya Sai College at Murwillumbah, a K-12, non denominational school in which the NESA curriculum is integrated with the five human values of Love, Peace, Truth, Right Conduct and Non Violence won the Sustainability Award in Education.

In Canada, the Fraser Institute, an independent Canadian research and educational organization, had ranked the Sathya Sai School of Canada as one of the top 37 elementary schools in Ontario. The Sathya Sai School had scored a perfect 10 out of 10 in the institute&#x27;s overall rating for academic performance.

A Sathya Sai School was set up in the Lopburi province of Thailand in 1991 by Art-Ong Jumsai na Ayudhya, with focus on &#x27;human values&#x27; along with academics. The school is a role model in Thailand, with hundreds of students from kindergarten up to high school level, and offers everything, including boarding, free-of-charge. The school is able to fund itself by growing its own rice and vegetables. It also produces solar and hydro electricity, selling surplus supply to the Provincial Electricity Authority.

The Federal Senate (Brazil) held a special session to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of Sathya Sai Institute of Education (an arm of the organization) in Brazil

<text>A Hat Full of Sky is a comic fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, set on the Discworld and written with younger readers in mind. It is labelled a &quot;Story of Discworld&quot; to indicate its status as children&#x27;s or young adult fiction, unlike most of the books in the &quot;Discworld&quot; series. First published in 2004, the book is set two years after &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot;, and features an 11-year-old Tiffany Aching.

The book is also a sequel to the &quot;Discworld&quot; short story &quot;The Sea and Little Fishes&quot;, which introduced the Witch Trials and Mrs Earwig. It is followed by &quot;Wintersmith&quot;.

== Plot summary ==
&quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot; by Terry Pratchett is a fantasy novel about a girl who is learning her place as a witch. Early in the novel, Tiffany Aching leaves her home in the chalk country (based on England&#x27;s chalk country) to act as an apprentice and maid for the elderly witch Miss Level. Her former teacher, Miss Tick, who is also a witch, escorts her to the town of Twoshirts. While waiting for Miss Level to arrive, they are attacked by a hiver. The hiver cannot be killed or seen and it takes over your mind. The encounter is only for a few seconds, and then the hiver leaves but it gives Tiffany and Miss Tick a fright. Miss Level comes along on a broomstick and takes Tiffany to her cottage in the mountains.

After settling in Tiffany discovers that Miss Level has two bodies and she has a spirit named Oswald who cleans her house. After settling into the cottage, Tiffany goes to a group of apprentice witches her age with Petulia. The leader of the group is called Annagramma and many characters find her condescending and rude. Tiffany leaves the group upset after telling them about her imaginary hat. While in her room at the cottage, the hiver finds her and takes over her body and mind. At first Tiffany does not realize what has happened, but when she does, it is too late for her to take action. The hiver (as Tiffany) causes chaos, steals Mr Weavall&#x27;s money and causes Annagramma to fear her.

Upon arrival at the cottage, the hiver kills one of Miss Level&#x27;s bodies. Rob Anybody, who is one of the Nac Mac Feegle (pictsies that are very loyal to Tiffany after she previously helped them), goes into Tiffany&#x27;s mind along with some of his friends to try to fight the hiver out of her mind. They decide that smells from her past will bring forth the actual Tiffany and she will be able to break free. With the help of the Nac Mac Feegle, Tiffany fights the hiver out of her mind, but she is still left with the memories of previous victims of the hiver. Mr. Weavall discovers that Tiffany stole his money, but the Feegles put gold in place of the copper he had saved up. Tiffany decides that the hiver must be dealt with so she proceeds to pursue it in the mountains. Mistress Weatherwax accompanies her although Tiffany is begrudging. They camp in the mountains and Mistress Weatherwax borrows an owl&#x27;s mind to observe the hiver as it lurks close by. Mistress Weatherwax tells Tiffany to call her Granny Weatherwax.

In the morning Tiffany and Mistress Weatherwax head off to the witch trials, an annual event where witches show what they have learned. Upon arrival, Tiffany senses the hiver moving in on her and turns to Granny Weatherwax only to find that she is not there. Panicking, she runs until she finds Granny Weatherwax who tells her it is time to face the hiver alone. Tiffany welcomes the hiver to her mind, and discovers that the hiver does not understand humans, it just wants to seek shelter from the world because it senses everything. Tiffany names the hiver Arthur and teaches it how to die which is its ultimate goal. She shows it the way across the desert to death. As she turns to exit the world of death, she finds that the door she entered has disappeared. Turning back around, Death confronts her but she is rescued by Granny Weatherwax.

Granny Weatherwax gives Tiffany her hat but she returns it because she wants to make her own. The novel ends on Tiffany returning 
to the chalk to take the place of her dead grandmother as the witch of the land. She decides to make her hat out of the sky.

== Reception ==
&quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot; has been described as &quot;compelling and hilarious,&quot; as well as &quot;finely tuned&quot; by Audiofile. Terry Pratchett &quot;gives a clear nuance to characters&quot; This book is a piece of &quot;top notch writing,&quot; and it is &quot;definitely worth your attention.&quot; The Wee Free Men have been received as &quot;brave, loyal, strong and funny.&quot; Mr. Pratchett &quot;isn&#x27;t afraid to detour into biting satire,&quot; and his writing is &quot;achingly beautiful.&quot;
The storyline is &quot;believable and convincing [by] bringing [the story] down to the grass roots level.&quot; The book has been described as an &quot;art form&quot; and there is &quot;seldom anything that can beat it.&quot;
Although the majority of critics receive this book positively, the Washington Post says that this book is &quot;frustratingly sloppy.&quot; They go on to say &quot;it doesn&#x27;t feel as if Tiffany has earned her victory, or as if Pratchett is doing justice to his inquisitive young heroine.&quot;

== Major themes ==
A general theme presented throughout the book, agreed on by many critics is &quot;the critical question of identity,&quot; &quot;self sacrifice[,] and responsibility.&quot; As Tiffany is on the &quot;brink of adolescence,&quot; she learns to develop a &quot;more conscious of image&quot; of herself, and the world. Pratchett explores this questioning of identity through Tiffany&#x27;s need to &quot;find a way to come into her own power as a witch.&quot; The book &quot;reveals philosophic truths about life and identity.&quot; The Washington Post agreed that Tiffany&#x27;s development was central to the theme of the novel, describing Tiffany as the only three dimensional character: &quot;all characters except Tiffany are two dimensional.&quot; The Post explained that she is &quot;strong enough to hide a section of her mind within herself.&quot;

<doc id="622097" wikidata="Q5634242" url="?curid=622097" title="HMS Sceptre (S104)">
<text>The fifth HMS &quot;Sceptre&quot; is a built by Vickers in Barrow-in-Furness. She was launched in 1976, with a bottle of cider against her hull. She was commissioned on 14 February 1978, by Lady Audrey White. She was the tenth nuclear fleet submarine to enter service with the Royal Navy. She was decommissioned on 10 December 2010, at which time she was the oldest commissioned vessel in the Royal Navy still available for service; in total around 1,500 men served aboard during her commission. In theory, she is replaced by the first in service, HMS &quot;Astute&quot;.

==Service==

===Collision with a Soviet submarine===
&quot;Sceptre&quot; has suffered several severe accidents in her career. On 23 May 1981 she collided with Soviet submarine &quot;K-211&quot; and her reactor&#x27;s protection systems would have performed an automatic emergency shutdown (scrammed the reactor), but her captain ordered the safety mechanisms overridden (battleshort enabled). The crew were told to say that they had hit an iceberg.

Much of &quot;Sceptre&quot;″s forward outer casing was torn away; there was damage to the fin with the bridge no longer there; and the propeller of the Russian boat had cut into the pressure hull.
This incident was disclosed when David Forghan, &quot;Sceptre&quot;″s former weapons officer, gave a television interview which was broadcast on 19 September 1991. The Soviet submarine collided with was &quot;K-211&quot; of the Delta III class, which on 23 May 1981 collided with an unknown submarine, identified at the time as an unknown American submarine.

===1987 refit===
In 1987 &quot;Sceptre&quot; was fitted with an improved reactor core (Core Z). In March 1990, there was a coolant leak while &quot;Sceptre&quot; was at Devonport. On 20 October 1991, there was a fire onboard while the boat was moored at Faslane. In August 1995 &quot;Sceptre&quot; was forced to abort her patrol and return to Faslane after suffering, in the words of the Ministry of Defence, &quot;an unspecified fault in the propulsion system.&quot; A defect in &quot;Sceptre&quot;″s reactor was discovered in 1998, though its seriousness was not appreciated until after the investigation of another serious accident.

===&quot;Scotia&quot; incident (1989)===

In November 2010, it was reported in Hansard that &quot;Sceptre&quot; had snagged the nets of the fishing vessel &quot;Scotia&quot; in November 1989.

===Propulsion trial accident (2000)===
On 6 March 2000 &quot;Sceptre&quot; suffered a serious accident while inside a drydock at the Rosyth yards while undergoing trials towards the end of a major refit. The test involved flooding the drydock, and running the main engines slowly with steam supplied from the shore. However, too much steam was used and the engines went to full speed. &quot;Sceptre&quot; broke her moorings and shot forward off the cradle she rested on. The steam line ruptured, scaffolding buckled, a crane was pushed forward some 15 feet, and the submarine moved forward some inside the dock.

===Return to active service (2003)===
The investigation into the runaway also looked at &quot;Sceptre&quot;″s reactor problems, and recommended that the boat be scrapped. In January 2002, with &quot;Sceptre&quot; still laid up, Defence Minister Adam Ingram declared that the problem was &quot;small original fabrication imperfections&quot; in the reactor pressure vessel. He could not say how long it would take to inspect and repair the problem. In March 2003, &quot;Sceptre&quot; left Rosyth Dockyard, after being in refit for six years, to undertake sea trials; she was the last submarine refitted in Rosyth. In late October 2003, &quot;Sceptre&quot; completed her post-refit sea trials and returned to active service.

===Gibraltar controversy (2005)===
On 3 February 2005, &quot;Sceptre&quot; put in at Gibraltar for repairs, expecting to leave within six days. British officials assured Spanish officials that damage is in the cooling system of the boat&#x27;s diesel generator, not to the nuclear propulsion system. ( spent much of 2000 at Gibraltar repairing a leak in her reactor coolant system.) Nonetheless, Spain&#x27;s Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos registered Spain&#x27;s &quot;firm protest&quot; with Jack Straw, and insisted that &quot;Sceptre&quot; be the last British submarine repaired at Gibraltar. In addition, Peter Caruana, Gibraltar&#x27;s Chief Minister, claimed that he had been misinformed about the repairs by the British Ministry of Defence, and that he had learned the true extent of the problems from Spanish sources. London officials had told him that the repairs were all external, neglecting to mention the diesel generator&#x27;s cooling system. On 7 February 2005, British military spokeswoman Katherine Purdhoe announced that repairs had been completed; the boat left Gibraltar on 9 February.

==Fate==
HMS &quot;Sceptre&quot; was sent to the Falkland Islands to support the British garrison in March 2010, during Desire Petroleum&#x27;s exploratory oil drilling.

&quot;Sceptre&quot; returned to Devonport for the last time in May 2010 and was decommissioned on 10 December 2010 after 32 years of service. Her decommissioning ceremony was witnessed by 450 people and was conducted by Royal Naval Chaplain Rev. Bernard Clarke; in attendance was also the Mayor of Wigan, Michael Winstanley, as a representative of the town she long had an affiliation with. As of 2020, she is docked at HMNB Devonport, Plymouth awaiting dismantling.

<text>East Croydon is a railway station, tram stop and associated bus station in Croydon, Greater London, England. It is located in Travelcard Zone 5. At from , it is the 20th busiest station in Britain, was the 10th busiest in 2020–21 (due to the COVID pandemic), is the busiest national rail station in London outside of fare zones 1 and 2 and is one of the busiest non-terminal stations in the country. It is one of three railway stations in the London Borough of Croydon with Croydon in their name, the others being West Croydon and South Croydon. A Tramlink tram stop is located immediately outside the main station entrance.

The present station building opened on 19 August 1992. It consists of a large steel and glass frame suspended from a lightweight steel structure that straddles the track and platforms to a much greater extent than was possible with its Victorian predecessor. Four steel ladder masts anchor the glass box and the whole gives the impression of a suspension bridge that stretches into the distance. External canopies cover the entrances, a café&#x27;s open-air seating area and the approaches to the tram stop. of glass were used in the roof and for the wall glazing.

It was announced in 2010 that Network Rail had proposed a £20m project to revamp the station with an additional entrance and a shortcut into the town centre. The new bridge was officially opened in December 2013. Disabled-accessible slopes to all platforms are provided and there is a footbridge connecting all platforms. There are refreshment stalls and vending machines in the seating areas on the platforms, and trolleys are available along with step-free access to buffets. There are electronic information displays showing departures to 80 stations.

==History==
The population of Croydon increased 14-fold (from 16,700 to 233,000) between the opening of the station in 1841 and 1921. As a result, the station has been enlarged and rebuilt on several occasions.

===Opening===
On 12 July 1841, the London &amp; Brighton Railway (L&amp;BR) began passenger services through Croydon station (now East Croydon) on the Brighton Line from London Bridge to Haywards Heath. The station was designed by the architect David Mocatta, the second station in the town since the London and Croydon Railway (L&amp;CR) had opened its Croydon station (now West Croydon) in June 1839.

The station became jointly administered by the L&amp;BR and the South Eastern Railway (SER) in 1842, who shared the Brighton Main Line as far as Redhill. Fares from Croydon to London were common to two railways. In 1846, the L&amp;BR and the L&amp;CR amalgamated to form the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR), and the two stations were shortly renamed East Croydon and West Croydon to avoid confusion.

===New Croydon===
With the completion of the line to Victoria between 1860 and 1862, extra platforms were needed to provide a terminal for LB&amp;SCR suburban services to and from the West End of London whilst London Bridge trains continued to use the existing lines. The new platforms adjoined East Croydon but were treated by the LB&amp;SCR as a separate station named New Croydon, with its own ticket office, and which ran exclusively LBSCR services. This device enabled the railway to avoid breaking an agreement with the SER, whilst offering cheaper fares than the SER from the original station.

The terminal platforms at New Croydon proved difficult to operate, as there was limited space for locomotives to run around their trains. As a result, in 1863 the LB&amp;SCR obtained Parliamentary authority to build a extension to a new terminus at South Croydon, which provided the additional operating room.

===Central Croydon===
In 1864, the LB&amp;SCR obtained authorisation to construct a long branch line into the town centre near Katharine Street, where Central Croydon station was built. The line opened in 1868 but enjoyed little success and closed in 1871, only to reopen in 1886 under pressure from the council before finally closing in 1890. It was demolished and replaced by the town hall.

===1894/95 rebuilding===
By the late 1880s the station was again congested due to the growth of traffic on the main lines, the expansion of the suburban network in South London and the new line from Croydon to Oxted. As a result, the station was rebuilt and the tracks remodelled during 1894/5. At the same time the suburban lines were extended from South Croydon to Coulsdon North, where they joined the new Quarry line. In 1897–98, East Croydon and New Croydon were merged into a single station with the three island platforms that remain. The two stations kept separate booking accounts until the formation of the Southern Railway.

=== 1958 incident ===

On 4 July 1958, a passenger fell onto the running lines after attempting to leave his train on the wrong side. Station foreman Thomas Ashby saw that he was reaching for the live rail as he attempted to stand, and that an express train was approaching, and so jumped down onto the track and held the man down, safely, as the express passed. For his actions, Ashby was awarded the Order of Industrial Heroism, which was presented to him in the S.R.A. Club Hall at the station, on 7 October the same year.

===1992 rebuilding===
The present station building opened on 19 August 1992. It consists of a large steel and glass frame suspended from a lightweight steel structure that straddles the track and platforms to a much greater extent than was possible with its Victorian predecessor.

Four steel ladder masts anchor the glass box and the whole gives the impression of a suspension bridge that stretches into the distance. External canopies cover the entrances, a café&#x27;s open-air seating area and the approaches to the tram stop. of glass were used in the roof and for the wall glazing. The architects were Alan Brookes Associates and the structural engineers YRM Anthony Hunt Associates.

===2010 revamp plans===

It was announced in 2010 that Network Rail had proposed a £20m project to revamp the station with an additional entrance and a shortcut into the town centre. In September 2010, Croydon Council pledged £6m towards the revamp, ensuring that a bridge was included in the plans. The new bridge was officially opened in December 2013, providing pedestrian transfer between platforms as well as a new entrance at the northern end of the platforms and a more direct link to the town centre. The new walkway may be accessed from the town centre on the west via Lansdowne Walk, with access from Cherry Orchard Road on the east included in local development plans.

===Thameslink Programme===
The Thameslink Programme (formerly Thameslink 2000) was a £6 billion major project to expand the Thameslink network from 51 to 172 stations spreading northwards to Bedford, Peterborough, Cambridge and King&#x27;s Lynn. The project included the lengthening of platforms, station remodelling, new railway infrastructure (e.g. viaducts and tunnels) and new rolling stock. The project was completed in 2020 and has enabled 8 Thameslink trains per hour in each direction to service East Croydon.

==Services==
===Destinations===
The station has frequent services on the Brighton Main Line from London to and , the Thameslink Route from Brighton to via , and the Oxted Line to and . 
East Croydon serves destinations mainly in East Sussex, West Sussex, Surrey and Brighton &amp; Hove, including Gatwick Airport, Horsham, Caterham, Tattenham Corner, Brighton, Reigate, Redhill, Hastings, Eastbourne, Bognor Regis, Portsmouth, Tonbridge and many suburban stations in South London.

Trains include Thameslink services to Brighton, Redhill, Bedford, Luton and London Luton Airport, which means that the station has direct services to two airports. They also serve stations in or near the City of London, including St Pancras International, Farringdon, City Thameslink and London Blackfriars.

Southeastern to London Charing Cross and occasionally call at the station during periods of engineering work.

===Platforms===
;National Rail platforms

There are six platforms in the National Rail station in form of three islands numbered from the west to the east.

Platforms 1, 2, 4 are northbound platforms, with 1 and 2 on the fast line and 4 on the slow line, while platforms 3, 5, 6 are southbound platforms, with 3 on the fast line and 5 and 6 on the slow line.

;Tramlink platforms

There are 3 Tram platforms. Platform 1 is used for trams towards Elmers End, Beckenham Junction and New Addington. Platform 2 is not routinely used although some trams may stop at this platform, mainly is used for trams which are on diversion and terminate at East Croydon occasionally. Platform 3 is used for trams towards Wimbledon and West Croydon(loop).

===Former services===
Services from London Bridge to Tunbridge Wells via Redhill were operated by Southeastern until December 2008, when they were transferred to Southern and curtailed at Tonbridge. In 2018, Southern withdrew the Victoria to Tonbridge via Redhill service, instead opting to run an hourly shuttle between Redhill and Tonbridge.

CrossCountry services stopped at East Croydon on the route to Brighton and Newcastle, until they were withdrawn in December 2008 (after the franchise passed from Virgin to Arriva)

Southern services to London Charing Cross were withdrawn in December 2009.

==Future==
===Station expansion===

Several plans for station expansion have been put forward; none of which were confirmed to be happening by January 2015.

As part of the Croydon Vision 2020 regeneration scheme, East Croydon is expected be expanded to both the west and the east. Work has been planned on the west side for some time to increase station capacity, made more urgent by likely additional traffic from the planned Croydon Gateway nearby. A proposal by Arrowcroft, which included the 12,500-seat Croydon Arena, was rejected in August 2008. Arrowcroft had proposed a £24 million expansion of the station with a new &#x27;airport style&#x27; concourse above the tracks to the north of the station. Arrowcroft had agreed to contribute £500,000 to the build costs to offset the impact of their proposed Arena. The source of the remaining £23.5 million was not identified, and Network Rail had not committed this expenditure in its capital plans.

The alternative scheme called Ruskin Square, by the owners of the site Stanhope Schroders, includes a planned contribution of £1.1 million for station capacity improvements that could be quickly implemented and integrated into their planned scheme for a new urban park, a rebuilt Warehouse Theatre, a doctors&#x27; surgery, housing (50% &quot;affordable&quot;) and modern offices on the Croydon Gateway site.
To the east, towards Cherry Orchard Road, the proposed towers result in an extension to the station. The architect is &quot;Make&quot; with the client &quot;Menta&quot;, engineer &quot;Knight Frank&quot; and &quot;GL Hearn&quot;. Originally the project was planned to start in 2009, but this was later put back to 2019. The mixed-use scheme is for approximately 93,000 sq m (1 million sq ft) of accommodation in a series of crystalline towers. Some 70% of the area is planned to be residential accommodation, with the remaining 30% mixed commercial use, including offices and retail. Critical to all proposals are improvements to transport interchange. No project has yet delivered the necessary funds for significant enhancements.

In 2020, Network Rail revealed a proposal to move the station 100m north as part of a redevelopment of the nearby Selhurst Triangle junction, with the aim of increasing capacity and improving reliability. The rebuilt station would have two more platforms than today&#x27;s station. The project is currently unfunded but if it goes ahead it is hoped that the redeveloped station and junction would be complete by 2033.

===Renaming proposal===
In late 2014 plans were made to rename the station &quot;Croydon Central&quot;.

===Proposed rezoning===
East Croydon station is currently located in Travelcard Zone 5, but there is an ongoing campaign for East Croydon and the smaller West Croydon station (also located in Zone 5) to be rezoned to Travelcard Zone 4. It has been argued that the stations should be in Zone 4 because some stations currently in Zone 4 are further away from Central London, and that rezoning the stations will save commuters living in Croydon large amounts of money, attract investment to Croydon, create jobs in the town and make living in the area more attractive. It is expected that those commuting to Croydon would be largely unaffected by such a change. The issue has been debated in the House of Commons, but current train operator Southern has not formally submitted a proposal for such a change to Transport for London, which is required for a station to be rezoned.

===New entrance on Cherry Orchard Road===
A new entrance to the station was included as part of the Morello Quarter Phase II development being constructed to the east of the station, the plans stating: &quot;New pedestrian entrance into East Croydon Station via a high quality landscaped public space, new stairs and a temporary link structure connecting to the existing station bridge&quot;; however, at the East Croydon Community Organisation AGM on 16th July 2024, it was revealed by representatives of Network Rail that no ticket barrier would be installed by Network Rail at the Cherry Orchard Road (eastern) side of the bridge due to the cost of installation and subsequent staffing &amp; maintenance. At the same AGM, it was also noted that Network Rail may review the provision of ticket barriers at the station in the future.

==Selhurst Depot==
There is a large railway depot for Southern and Thameslink trains to the north at Selhurst.

==Transport connections==

East Croydon is well served by both tram and bus, with a tram stop outside and a bus station close by. London Bus services reach Central London, Purley Way, Bromley, Lewisham and places to the south. Route SL7, the longest London bus route, runs to Heathrow Airport via Sutton and Kingston.

Immediately outside the station is the Tramlink stop, with services to Elmers End, Beckenham Junction, New Addington and Wimbledon. A major interchange, East Croydon has three tram platforms, two on an island, the other backing on to the station entrance. Following problems with the points in this area, in August 2006 they were fixed to route all eastbound trams into Platform 1, the concourse-side platform. The island platform can be used only by westbound trams and by trams terminating from the east.

==Crime==
In January 2006 the London Assembly issued statistics of crime in main-line railway stations outside Zone 1. East Croydon, Clapham Junction and Walthamstow Central were the worst affected. Both councils and railway companies were blamed.

<text>A Koreatown (), also known as a Little Korea or Little Seoul, is a Korean-dominated ethnic enclave within a city or metropolitan area outside the Korean Peninsula.

==History==
Koreatowns as an East Asian ethnic enclave have only been in existence since the mid-1860s, as Korea had been a territorially stable polity for centuries; according to Jaeeun Kim, &quot;The congruence of territory, polity, and population was taken for granted.&quot; Large-scale emigration from Korea was only mainly into the Russian Far East and Northeast China; these emigrants became the ancestors of the two million Koreans in China and several hundred thousand ethnic Koreans in Central Asia.

Koreatowns in the western countries such as the United States and Canada have only been in place much later with the Los Angeles Koreatown receiving official recognition in 2008. Also many Koreatowns are not officially sanctioned where the only evidence of such enclaves exist as clusters of Korean stores with Korean signage existing only on the storefronts. In the 1992 Los Angeles riots, many Korean businesses were targeted where the signage only served to point out targets for rioters. In Philadelphia&#x27;s Koreatown, anti-Korean sentiment was so strong that official signage was often vandalized as residents protested the &quot;official recognition&quot; of such areas, making many Koreatowns across the western countries never having official statuses that many Chinatowns receive today. Many Koreatowns today exist in a suburban setting as opposed to the urban settings of Chinatown mainly because many ethnic Koreans, especially in the western countries, fear crime that is often associated with the city dwellings and the higher quality of schools as education is often a top priority, which is why the Philadelphia Koreatowns exist in suburban settings such as Cheltenham, Pennsylvania instead of its original location in the Olney section of Philadelphia.

==Characteristics==
The features described below are characteristic of many modern Koreatowns.

===Korean signage===
Many modern Koreatowns will exhibit the usage of the Korean language and Hangul on storefront signs sometimes on official highway signage. Officially sanctioned Koreatowns may also exhibit signs in the local language. In English, the word &quot;Koreatown&quot;, &quot;Little Korea&quot; and &quot;Korea Way&quot; can sometimes be seen, as in the case with the Los Angeles Koreatown. 

===Korean restaurants===
Many Koreatowns will have stores that serve Korean cuisine, usually serving as the major differentiator between other East Asian and Southeast Asian ethnic enclaves such as Chinatown and Little Saigons. The Korean national cuisine known today has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in Southern Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula, Korean cuisine has evolved through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.

Korean cuisine is largely based upon rice, vegetables and meats. Traditional Korean meals are noted for the number of side dishes (&quot;banchan&quot;) that accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Kimchi is served often, sometimes at every meal. Commonly used ingredients include sesame oil, &quot;doenjang&quot; (fermented bean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, pepper flakes and &quot;gochujang&quot; (fermented red chili paste).

==Locations==

===Korean demographics===

Many Koreatowns are actual ethnic enclaves where nearly four-fifths of migrant Koreans live in just three countries: China, the United States and Mexico. Other countries with greater than 0.5% Korean minorities include Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, New Zealand, and Uzbekistan. All these figures include both permanent migrants and sojourners. If one focuses on long-term residents, there were about 5.3 million Korean emigrants as of 2010.

===Americas===

====Argentina====

Buenos Aires&#x27;s &#x27;Barrio Coreano&#x27; is in the neighborhood of Flores, specifically in the south of this neighborhood. The primary artery of the district is Avenida Carabobo, which houses various Korean businesses and organizations, including restaurants, beauty salons, a Korean school (Instituto Coreano Argentino) and churches, among others.
In recent years, there has been a huge move from the Bajo Flores towards the Avellaneda Avenue, the reason being the increasing theft and insecurity around the slums close to Avenida Castanares. What some might call these days &quot;The New Koreatown&quot; has been increasing in size at a faster rate while the shops in Avenida Carabobo have been closing.
There are over 22,000 Koreans in Argentina, most of them in Buenos Aires, where the Asian population is around 2.5%.

====Brazil====

Brazil has several Korean enclaves but, recently a Koreatown was formed in Bom Retiro a densely populated area of Brazil&#x27;s biggest city, São Paulo. It is also a Korean gastronomic center. There are traditional dishes such as bibimbap and samgyeopsal or a good cup of coffee at a cafe like the ones in Seoul. There are also Korean markets with hard-to-find Hansik ingredients such as gochujang, soybean sauce and sesame oil. Korean culture is also well preserved in there. Korean culture is mixed with that of Brazil in this neighborhood: Posters with Hangul written on them are alongside those in Portuguese, and most people are fluent in both Korean and Portuguese in the area.

Also, the residents of Bom Retiro preserve Korean culture while making it more vigorous and active. Cultural festivals including K-pop concerts are held there frequently, and many museums or workshops allow visitors to experience traditional Korean culture. Quite a few Korean artists also live in this community. For instance, Hwang Young-ah uses Bom Retiro as a platform to exhibit her collections and cultivate her artistic talent. And the Hallyu Cultural Center was opened a few years ago to offer a variety of programs on Korean culture including classes in the Korean language, K-pop dance and traditional handicrafts.

The city of Fortaleza in Ceará state hosted many immigrants from South Korea in Brazil.

The Korean consulate in Brazil said that the municipal government in São Paulo has designated Bom Retiro as &#x27;Koreatown&#x27; and could pass an ordinance that will see the city provide administrative and financial support to the new community.

====Chile====

The Korean population of Chile is mostly concentrated in Patronato in Santiago. Currently, approximately 3000 Koreans live in Chile.
The Korean community is well organized and united. Colonia Coreana organizes several events annually. Among these events are: soccer tournaments, Korean festivals, and the annual Mr. and Ms. Patronato.

====Mexico====
Mexico has a large Korean population that lives in and around Zona Rosa in Mexico City. According to the newspaper &quot;Reforma&quot;, there are at least 1,000 Koreans living in Zona Rosa and about 3,000 total in Colonia Juárez, the larger official neighborhood of which Zona Rosa is a part. The area around Hamburgo, Praga, Florencia, and Biarritz streets converted into “Pequeño Seul,” or Little Seoul in the 1990s before receding since then.

====Canada====
=====Toronto, Ontario=====
Toronto officially designated the area on Bloor Street from Bathurst Street to Christie St. as Koreatown in 2004.[12] According to the 2001 census Toronto had roughly 43,000 Koreans living in the city,[13] and in 2011 the numbers have grown to 64,755.[14] The Korean community in Toronto has developed Koreatown such that it offers a Korean grocery store,[15]hairdressers, karaoke bars and a multitude of restaurants.[16] The City of Toronto describes Koreatown as &quot;primarily a business district offering a wide range of Korean restaurants, high-end-fashion Korean boutiques, herbalists, acupuncturist and many other unique services and shops which are filled with made-in-Korea merchandise.&quot;[12] Koreatown Toronto is also known for its Spring Dano Festival, which is run on the 5th day of 5th month of the Korean Lunar Calendar. The festival is run in the Christie Pits area and has been run for the past 21 years with the exception of 2013 when it was cancelled.[12][17] Today, although many Koreans work in the area, very few Koreans actually live there. An influx of Latino immigrants is changing the demographics of the area today.

Koreatown North is the unofficial name for the area situated along Yonge Street from Sheppard Avenue in North York, an administrative area in northern Toronto, to the Clark Avenue in neighboring Thornhill, Ontario. This area does not have official signage as they are mixed with establishments catering to Persians and Chinese clientele.

=====Vancouver, British Columbia=====
The highest concentration of Koreans is found near Lougheed Town Centre in Burnaby, British Columbia and in the adjacent city of Coquitlam. Along the North Road (from Delestre Ave (South) to Burquitlam Skytrain Station (North)), sizable supermarkets such as Hannam Supermarket and H Mart, hair shops, Korean restaurants, bars, law firms, accountants&#x27; offices, realty offices, child care, clinics and auto repair shops are to be found. For a few years, following the housing boom, the number of Korean Canadians has increased in Langley, Surrey, Port Coquitlam, Maple Ridge, Mission and Abbotsford, and more businesses are opening up shops and offices in east Metro Vancouver and Fraser Valley.

====United States====
The first large group of Korean immigrants settled in the United States between 1901 and 1905. Between those years 7,226 immigrants, including 6,048 men, 637 women, and 541 children, came on 65 trips. Most of the early immigrants of that period had some contract with American missionaries in Korea. For some Western-oriented Korean intellectuals, immigrating to the United States was considered useful, in part, to help them in the modernization of their homeland. Consequently, the recruiter for labourers for the Hawaiian Sugar Planters&#x27; Association (HSPA), David Deshler, had no trouble finding Koreans from a wide range of social classes willing to sail to Hawaii.

San Francisco, Dinuba, and Riverside, California have a claim as the first Korean U.S. settlement.
=====Atlanta, Georgia=====
In 2010, Atlanta has a population of approximately 94,000 individuals of Korean descent. Atlanta&#x27;s Koreatown is mostly centered around the corridor extending from Duluth, Georgia, westward along Buford Highway into northeast Atlanta and Suwanee, Georgia. KoreanBeacon named Atlanta #5 in its list of Top Korean-American cities, citing the Korean population in Gwinnett County, GA (which contains Duluth) doubling over the past decade, in addition to large stretches of Buford Highway being populated with retail and services with many signs in Korean. Atlanta also has four Korean-language television stations broadcast in the Atlanta area, in addition to a local daily Korean newspaper, the Atlanta ChoSun.

=====Aurora, Colorado=====
Roughly two thousand Korean immigrants live in Aurora, and the stretch of Havana Street running from Mississippi Avenue to Iliff Avenue contains a very high number of Korean businesses. A motion to designate the surrounding area as an official Koreatown was at one time considered by the Aurora City Council.

=====Baltimore, Maryland=====

There is a small portion of lower Charles Village, referred to as the Station North Arts and Entertainment District, is sometimes referred to as Koreatown or Little Korea and is home to a number of Korean restaurants, but it has not been officially designated as a Koreatown. This developing Koreatown is bounded on the north by 24th Street, on the south by North Avenue, on the west by Maryland Avenue, and on the east by St. Paul Street. Meanwhile, suburban Ellicott City, Maryland and Catonsville, Maryland has also developed Koreatowns, along Route 40.

=====Boston, Massachusetts=====
Boston&#x27;s Koreatown is in Allston Village and includes parts of Cambridge Street and Brighton, Harvard, and Commonwealth Avenues, with a growing Korean and Korean American residential and commercial presence.

=====Chicago, Illinois=====
Chicago&#x27;s Albany Park neighborhood has been referred to as Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Koreatown&quot; since the 1980s. The majority of Korean shops in Albany Park can be found along Lawrence Avenue (4800 North) between Kedzie (3200 West) and Pulaski (4000 West). This particular section of Lawrence Avenue has been officially designated by the city of Chicago as &quot;Seoul Drive&quot; because of the multitude of Korean-owned enterprises on the street. Although many of the Korean Americans in the neighborhood have been moving to the north suburbs in recent years, it still retains its Korean flavor. Every year there is a Korean festival, and the neighborhood is home to a Korean television station (WOCH-CD Ch. 41) and radio station (1330 AM) as well as two Korean-language newspapers. There are still many Korean businesses interspersed among the newer Mexican bakeries and Middle Eastern grocery stores. Approximately 45% of the businesses on this particular stretch of Lawrence Avenue are owned by Korean-Americans.

=====Columbus, Ohio=====

Koreatown is in the vicinity of Bethel and Henderson Roads in Northwest Columbus. This area includes several Korean grocery stores, churches, and restaurants.

=====Dallas, Texas=====
Dallas has the largest Korean-American community in Texas and second (to Atlanta) in the southern United States. A sizable Koreatown can be found in Dallas. In 2023, The state of Texas officially designated the area as a Koreatown in legislation. This area in the Northwest part of the city, known as the Asian Trade District, is characterized by a large number of Korean-owned businesses serving the city&#x27;s sizable Korean-American community, concentrated along a 1.5 mile strip of Royal Lane between Luna Rd and Harry Hines Blvd. Although Korean business is undoubtedly the most dominant in the area, there are isolated Chinese and Vietnamese businesses as well.

Another Koreatown can be found in Carrollton, Texas, which is part of the greater DFW area. This area is referred to as &quot;New Koreatown&quot; by locals, due to it growing from the arrival of Hmart to the city. Over the years, more and more restaurants and shops have opened around the Hmart.

Ellicott City, Maryland

Ellicott City is home to the officially-designated Koreatown in Maryland.

=====Honolulu, Hawaii=====
Korean businesses congregate on Keeaumoku Street, which earned the nickname &quot;Koreamoku.&quot; As of 2016 it has been officially designated as a Koreatown. Roughly bounded by Kalakaua Ave (East), Kapiolani Blvd. (South), King St. (North) and Keeaumoku St. (West). With recent gentrification and condominiums pricing out Korean merchants in the Ke‘eaumoku district, a new Koreatown is emerging in downtown Honolulu.

=====Houston, Texas=====

Spring Branch in Houston is considered to have the largest Koreatown in the Houston area.

=====Orange County, California=====

Koreatown (also referred to as Little Seoul or the Korean Business District on nearby street signage) is on Garden Grove Boulevard between Beach Boulevard (Route 39) and Brookhurst Street in Garden Grove, Orange County, California. The Korean population in Orange County more than doubled between 1990 and 2010.

=====Los Angeles, California=====

The Greater Los Angeles Area is home to the largest number of ethnic Koreans outside of the Korean Peninsula. Koreatown is an officially recognized district of the city and contains probably the heaviest concentration of Korean residents and businesses. However, when the term &quot;Koreatown&quot; is used it usually refers to a larger area that includes the adjacent neighborhoods of Wilshire Center, Harvard Heights and Pico Heights. Koreans began to move into the area in the late 1960s after changes in US immigration laws as part of the greater Civil Rights Movement (especially the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 which formally ended the Chinese Exclusion Act), establishing numerous businesses, although never outnumbering Latino residents. In the aftermath of the 1992 riots, Koreatown entered into a period of development, especially during the 1994 Asian Market Crisis as South Korean investors sought to invest in the then-profitable California real-estate market. More recently, L.A.&#x27;s Koreatown has been perceived to have experienced declining political power secondary to re-districting and an increased crime rate, prompting an exodus of Koreans from the area.

=====Newport News, Virginia=====
A Korean Enclave exists on the north end of Newport News, Virginia. It is centered around Denbigh Blvd and Warwick Blvd, following mostly along Warwick Blvd. Originally the area was established as an enclave when Korean War veterans stationed at the nearby Fort Eustis brought home wives from Korea. The area has been affectionately called &quot;little Seoul&quot; because of this. There are numerous shops catering the Korean population of the entire Hampton Roads area. The shops range from hair salons, to grocers, and even a bakery. There are also significant numbers of Taiwanese, Philippine, Vietnamese and other Asian ethnicities in the area.

=====New York metropolitan area=====
As of the 2010 United States Census, the self-identified Korean American population in the metropolitan New York Combined Statistical Area was 218,764, the second largest population of ethnic Koreans outside Korea.

According to the 2011 American Community Survey, there were approximately 100,000 Korean Americans in New York City, with two-thirds living in borough of Queens. In particular, Fresh Meadows is home to the most Korean immigrants of any neighbourhood in the city. In Bergen County, New Jersey, where several towns are home to significant Korean populations, the survey counted 63,247 Korean Americans or 6.9% of the total population. The Korean population in borough of Manhattan has nearly doubled to approximately 20,000 since the 2000 Census.

As of 2014, there were 180 franchisees of Korean coffeehouse chain Caffe Bene in the metro area. Korean Air and Asiana Airlines provide non-stop flights from Seoul to JFK Airport.

======Manhattan======

In Midtown Manhattan, Koreatown is bordered by 31st and 33rd Streets, Fifth Avenue, and the Avenue of the Americas, close to the Empire State Building and Macy&#x27;s at Herald Square. The heart of the district is the block of 32nd Street between Fifth Avenue and Broadway, officially nicknamed &quot;Korea Way&quot;, which features stores on multiple stories, with small, independently run establishments reaching up to the third or fourth floors, including restaurants, exuding an ambience of Seoul. The New York City Korean Chamber of Commerce estimates there to be more than 100 small businesses on the block. It is home to numerous restaurants that serve both traditional and/or regional Korean cuisine and Korean fusion fare (including Korean Chinese cuisine), several bakeries, grocery stores, supermarkets, bookstores, consumer electronics outlets, video rental shops, tchotchke and stationery shops, hair and nail salons, &quot;noraebang&quot; bars, nightclubs, as well as cell phone service providers, internet cafés, doctors&#x27; offices, banks, and hotels. Approximately twelve 24/7 restaurants conduct business on Korea Way. According to the 2000 Census, a slightly larger area including Koreatown was 46 percent Asian. Koreatown is expanding eastward toward Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.

======Long Island======
The Long Island Koreatown is one of the largest and fastest growing ethnic enclaves outside Korea. The core of this Koreatown originated in the Flushing neighborhood borough of Queens. It has continued to expand rapidly eastward through the neighborhoods of Murray Hill, Bayside, Douglaston and Little Neck, and into adjacent suburban Nassau County, Long Island. In the 1980s, a continuous stream of Korean immigrants many of whom began as workers in the medical field or Korean international students moved to New York City to find or initiate professional or entrepreneurial positions. They established a foothold on Union Street in Flushing between 35th and 41st Avenues, featuring restaurants and karaoke (&quot;noraebang&quot;) bars, grocery markets, education centers and bookstores, banking institutions, offices, electronics vendors, apparel boutiques and other commercial enterprises. As the community grew more affluent and rose in socioeconomic status, Koreans moved eastward along Northern Boulevard, buying homes in more affluent and less crowded Queens neighborhoods and Nassau County, bringing their businesses with them. The eastward pressure was created in part by the inability to move westward due to the formidable presence of the enormous Flushing Chinatown () centered on Main Street. The expansion led to the creation of an American &quot;Meokjagolmok&quot; or &quot;Restaurant Street&quot;, around the Murray Hill station of Long Island Rail Road station which is reminiscent of Seoul. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a &quot;Kimchi Belt&quot; stretches along Northern Boulevard and the Long Island Rail Road tracks, from Flushing into Nassau County; while according to a Korean food chef, &quot;Queens is the closest you can come to authentic Korean food&quot;. The Long Island Koreatown features numerous restaurants that serve both traditional and/or regional Korean cuisine. Korean Chinese cuisine is also available in the Long Island Koreatown.

======Bergen County======

Koreans began moving to Eastern Bergen County, New Jersey in the 1980s and by the 1990s, several enclaves were established. According to the 2010 Census, Bergen County had the highest per capita population of Koreans of any United States county, at 6.3%, including all of the nation&#x27;s top ten municipalities by percentage of Korean population. In 2012, the county mandated the publication of voting ballots in the Korean language.
The two most prominent Koreatowns are centered along Broad Avenue in Palisades Park and Leonia, Ridgefield and around the intersection of Main Street and Lemoine Avenue in Fort Lee, close to the George Washington Bridge. Both districts have developed dining destinations for Korean cuisine, while Broad Avenue in Palisades Park has evolved into a dessert destination as well. Koreatown, Palisades Park has been nicknamed the &quot;Korean village&quot; and &quot;Koreatown on the Hudson&quot;. The Chusok Korean Thanksgiving harvest festival has become an annual tradition celebrated in Overpeck County Park. Korean &quot;chaebols&quot; have established North American headquarters operations in Bergen County, including Samsung, LG Corp, and Hanjin Shipping. Korean professionals have also expanded northward into the Northern Valley area and more recently, into adjacent Rockland County, New York. Route 303 in Tappan, New York, Rockland County, has become the hub of Korean activity in the Lower Hudson Valley area.

=====Oakland, California=====

The largest concentration of Korean businesses and community services in the San Francisco Bay Area is centered on Oakland&#x27;s Telegraph Avenue between 20th and 35th Streets between Downtown Oakland and the Temescal district. Roughly 150 Korean-owned businesses are located in the neighborhood, including a shopping center and Korean American community centers. This segment of Telegraph Avenue is lined with bright banners proclaiming the district as &quot;Koreatown-Northgate&quot; with the slogan &quot;Oakland&#x27;s got Seoul&quot; and accompanied by an annual cultural festival. Officially named &quot;Koreatown-Northgate&quot;, the area was characterized by urban decay before Korean Americans began opening businesses and reviving the area in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Before 1991, the area was characterized by homelessness and crime and was known as the Northgate district. The aftermath of the Los Angeles Riots of 1992 also saw a large number of Koreans from Southern California moving to the Bay Area and opening businesses and buying property in the district on a large scale. There has been criticism from the non-Korean residents about the city officially naming the district Koreatown, mostly from the African American population who form the majority in the area. Despite Korean Americans owning much of the property in the neighborhood, the largest group of residents still remains African American. Tensions remain between African Americans and Koreans in the neighborhood, which has witnessed declines in both populations. Despite some Koreans continuing to move into the neighborhood, the majority of the Bay Area&#x27;s Korean population is concentrated in the suburbs surrounding Oakland and in the South Bay.

=====Philadelphia, Pennsylvania=====
Philadelphia&#x27;s first Koreatown is located in the Olney section of the city. Since the late 1980s, the Korean community has expanded to the north and now straddles the border between Philadelphia proper and the suburb of Cheltenham, though many Korean American businesses and organizations and some residents remain in Olney and adjoining neighborhoods. Upper Darby Township, bordering West Philadelphia, also has a large Korean American population; meanwhile, a rapidly growing Korean population and commercial presence has emerged in nearby suburban Cherry Hill, New Jersey since 2010, centered along Marlton Pike.

=====Washington, D.C.=====
Koreatown in Annandale, Virginia starts at the intersection of Little River Turnpike and Hummer Road, runs for 1.5 miles to the turnpike&#x27;s intersection with Evergreen Lane and provides a hub for the 93,787 individuals of Korean descent residing in the Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV Combined Statistical Area, as estimated by the 2009 American Community Survey. According to the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, over 1,000 Korean-owned businesses are in Annandale. They cater to Koreans as well as non-Koreans. Businesses and establishments include accountants, banks, bakeries, billiards, bookstores, churches, college preparatory classrooms, cybercafés, department stores, newspapers, optometrists, real estate offices, restaurants and salons.

There are two Koreatowns in Beijing: The bigger Korean enclave is in Wangjing in the Chaoyang district. There are many Korean companies who have established their businesses in Wangjing. Wangjing also has an all-Korean international school (all grade levels) in the Wangjing vicinity. Many of the Korean businesses in Wangjing cater towards families, businessmen, students and tourists with restaurants, bath houses/spas, bookstores, clubs/bars, golfing and Korean banks. Although Wangjing is known as a Korean district, there is a great number of third- and fourth-generation Korean Chinese ethnic minorities who live and coexist with South Korean nationals.

The second Koreatown, Wudaokou, is in the Haidian district where most of the city&#x27;s universities are. Because of the vibrant university scene in Wudaokou, there are many Korean college students who live and attend universities in this area.

Although the Korean districts are on different ends of the city, Wangjing and Wudaokou are connected by subway line 13.

=====Qingdao=====

====Japan====
During the Korea under Japanese rule, approximately 2.4 million ethnic Koreans emigrated to Japan. Some for economic reasons and some were forced to move during the Second World War to work as laborers. While most departed after the war, still many chose to remain and were joined in the 1950s by a wave of refugees from Jeju Island. Today, Koreans, known as &quot;Zainichi Koreans&quot; (, &quot;Chaeilchosŏnin/Jaeil-Joseonin&quot;, who on paper retain the nationality of the old Korea) or &quot;Zainichi Koreans&quot; (, &quot;Chaeil-han&#x27;gugin/Jaeil Hangugin&quot;, who have adopted South Korean nationality), are the third ethnic minority in Japan, amounting to 436,000 in 2022. Those with North Korean ties are a key source of remittances to North Korea. There is a separate group of more recent migrants from South Korea with strong links to their home country, and there is a considerable cultural gap between these so-called &quot;newcomers&quot; and the Zainichi Koreans.

A shantytown of former forced laborers, Utoro district, exists in Uji, part of Kyoto Prefecture.

=====Osaka=====

Ikuno Korea Town in Osaka has a population of over 58,000, making it the largest in Japan. In Ikuno Ward, 16% of the inhabitants are of Korean origin.

Tokyo&#x27;s Korean-oriented commercial centre is located in the district of Okubo around the area of Shin-Okubo Station and Okubo Station in Shinjuku Ward. Shinjuku Ward itself has over 9,100 registered Korean residents, representing over 10% of the registered Korean residents in Tokyo. Unlike other Japanese Koreatowns, the Okubo Koreatown developed after World War II and is dominated by &quot;new-comers&quot; - recent immigrants from South Korea who have retained their ethnic and cultural identity, as can be seen from the ubiquitous signs written in hangul.

One of the contributing factors in the development of Okubo into a Korean area was the low rents. The low rents and willingness of landlords to accept foreign tenants attracted Korean and other Asian migrants to the area. These businesses cater to the migrant community and increasingly Japanese who come to experience ethnic cuisine. Other immigrants from China, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and various other nationalities including Muslim and Nepali operated stores make this one of the most colourful and multicultural areas in Tokyo.

The area around Mikawashima station on the Jōban Line, to the north of the city, is a Koreatown dominated by Zainichi immigrants from Jeju island.

<text>The Dix River is a tributary of the Kentucky River in central Kentucky in the United States. It begins in western Rockcastle County, about west of Mount Vernon. It flows generally northwest, in a tight meandering course, passing north of Stanford and east of Danville. Northeast of Danville it is impounded by the Dix Dam to form the Herrington Lake reservoir. The river flows about before joining the Kentucky River near High Bridge, about southwest of Lexington, in the region of the Kentucky River Palisades.

At Danville the river has a mean annual discharge of 480 cubic feet per second. The watershed of the river is largely agricultural land, with undulating hills over a bed of limestone. The river is a popular destination for fly fishing, in particular for varieties of bass. Occasionally, recreational kayakers and canoeists can be found on same-day trips. Water levels are Class I+ with possible mild class II.

<text>The Red River is a tributary of the Kentucky River in east-central Kentucky in the United States. Via the Kentucky and Ohio rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed.

It rises in the mountainous region of the Cumberland Plateau, in eastern Wolfe County, approximately east of Campton. It flows generally west, through Red River Gorge in the Daniel Boone National Forest, then past Stanton and Clay City. It joins the Kentucky approximately southeast of Winchester.

In 1993, a stretch of the river in the Red River Gorge was designated by the federal government as a National Wild and Scenic River.

The book &quot;The Unforeseen Wilderness&quot; by Wendell Berry was written to deter the Army Corps of Engineers from damming the Red River Gorge in 1971.

==Recreation==
The largest golden redhorse ever taken in Kentucky (4 lbs., 5 oz.) was taken in the Red River.

<doc id="622126" wikidata="Q3143161" url="?curid=622126" title="Humayun Azad">
<text>Humayun Azad (28 April 1947 – 12 August 2004) was a Bangladeshi poet, novelist, short-story writer, critic, linguist, columnist and professor of Dhaka University. He wrote more than 70 titles. He was awarded the Bangla Academy Literary Award in 1986 for his contributions to Bengali linguistics. In 2012, the government of Bangladesh honored him with Ekushey Padak posthumously for his contributions to Bengali literature.

==Early life and education==
Azad was born as Humayun Kabir on 28 April 1947 in Rarhikhal village in Bikrampur which village is now under the Sreenagar sub-district of Munshiganj district. Notable scientist Jagadish Chandra Bose was born in the same village. He passed the secondary examination from Sir Jagadish Chandra Basu Institute in 1962 and higher secondary examination from Dhaka College in 1964. He earned BA and MA degrees in Bengali language and literature from the University of Dhaka in 1967 and 1968 respectively. He obtained his PhD in linguistics submitting his thesis titled &quot;Pronominalisation in Bangla&quot; from the University of Edinburgh in 1976. Azad changed his surname from Kabir to Azad on 28 September 1988 by the magistrate of Narayanganj District.

==Career==
Azad started his career in 1969 by joining the Chittagong College. He joined the University of Chittagong as a lecturer on 11 February 1970 and Jahangirnagar University in December. He was appointed as an associate professor of Bengali at the University of Dhaka on 1 November 1978 and got promoted to the post of professor in 1986.

==Literary works==

Azad&#x27;s first collection of poems, written between 1968 and 1972, was published as &quot;Alaukik Istimar&quot; () in 1973, in which year he went to Scotland for studying Ph.D in linguistics from University of Edinburgh. He wrote a short-story in 1979 called &quot;Onoboroto Tusharpat&quot; () which was inspired from his newly-wed life with his Dhaka University class-mate Latifa Kohinoor. In Britain one day, Azad was driving a car with his wife during heavy snowfall which became the main plot of the short story; so many years later Azad included this short-story in his 1996 book &quot;Jadukorer Mrityu&quot; () which book is the collection of his own-written five short-stories.

Towards the end of the 1980s, he started to write newspaper column focusing on contemporary sociopolitical issues. His commentaries continued throughout the 1990s and were later published as books as they grew in numbers. Through his writings of the 1990s and early 2000s he established himself as a novelist.

In 1992, Azad published the first comprehensive feminist book in Bengali titled &quot;Naree&quot; (). &quot;Naree&quot; received both positive and negative reviews as a treatise, it was considered the first full-fledged feminist book after the independence of Bangladesh. In this work Azad mentioned the pro-women contributions of the British Raj&#x27;s two famous Bengali socio-political reformers: Raja Rammohan Roy and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, he criticized Rabindranath Tagore, a famous Bengali poet and Nobel laureate, and Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, a famous Bengali novelist of the 19th century. The work, critical of the patriarchal and male-chauvinistic attitude of society towards women, attracted negative reactions from many Bangladeshi readers. The government of Bangladesh banned the book in 1995. The ban was eventually lifted in 2000, following a legal battle that Azad won in the High Court of the country.

In the year of 1994 he published his first novel which was titled as &quot;Chhappanno Hajar Borgomail&quot; (); the novel was about military rule in Bangladesh in 1980s decade. He got special recognition for his second novel &quot;Sab Kichu Bhene Pare&quot; (1995) which was based on interpersonal relationship of Bangladeshi society. He wrote &quot;Ekti Khuner Svapna&quot; (), an unrequited love-based novel where the main male protagonist lives in Salimullah Muslim Hall of Dhaka University where Azad lived during his student life, it was Azad&#x27;s last novel published in 2004 in which year he died. Other important novels are &quot;Kobi Othoba Dondito Aupurush&quot; () and &quot;Nijer Shonge Nijer Jiboner Modhu&quot; (), the first was based on a fictitious late 20th century Bangladeshi male poet&#x27;s life who is castrated after involving in live-in relationship with a much younger woman and the latter was inspired by Humayun Azad&#x27;s own rural life when he was a teen-aged boy. Another noted novel written by Azad was &quot;Fali Fali Kore Kata Chand&quot; (), where the main female protagonist character Shirin is an educated young woman with self-boastfulness, she engages in adultery, leaves her husband and becomes misandrist.

Azad also wrote teen-age literature, among them, the discourse-book &quot;Laal Neel Deepabali&quot; is noted, this book was written for teen-aged boys and girls as Azad&#x27;s aim was to teach Bangladeshi adolescent boys and girls about the history of Bengali literature in short.

==Assassination attempt==
On 27 February 2004, near the campus of the University of Dhaka during the annual Bangla Academy book fair, two assailants, armed with chopper machetes, hacked Azad several times on the jaw, lower part of the neck and hands. Azad was taken to the nearby Dhaka Medical College and Hospital. By the order of the then Prime Minister of Bangladesh Khaleda Zia, Azad was immediately sent to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Dhaka for better treatment and later to Bumrungrad International Hospital in Thailand where he recovered.

Azad had been fearing for his life ever since excerpts of his novel, &quot;Pak Sar Jamin Sad Bad&quot; () were first published in &quot;The Daily Ittefaq Newspaper&quot;″s Eid supplement in 2003. In that novel, he indecorously criticised the political ideologies of the Islamic extremists of Bangladesh. After that book had been published, he started receiving various threats from the Islamist fundamentalists.

A week prior to Azad&#x27;s assault, Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, one of the members of parliament of Bangladesh said in the parliament, that Azad&#x27;s political satire &quot;Pak Sar Jamin Sad Bad&quot; must be banned; he also wanted infliction of the blasphemy law of Bangladesh for this kind of book. In 2006, one of the leaders of the fundamentalist organization Jama&#x27;atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) admitted to the RAB interrogators that his operatives carried out the attack on writer Azad, as well as two other murders, bomb blasts, and 2002 attacks on cinemas.

==Death==

On 12 August 2004, Azad was found dead in his apartment in Munich, Germany, where he had arrived a week earlier to conduct research on the nineteenth century German romantic poet Heinrich Heine, several months after the Islamists&#x27; machete attack on him at a book fair, which had left him grievously injured. His family demanded an investigation, alleging that the extremists who had attempted the earlier assassination had a role in this death. While alive, Azad had expressed his wish to donate his body to medical college after his death. Instead he was buried in Rarhikhal, his village home in Bangladesh, as doctors declined to take his body for medical research, as several days had passed for his body to reach Bangladesh from Germany. The first death anniversary of Azad was observed with respect in Rarhikhal village on Friday, the 12 August 2005.

==Personal life==
Azad met his future wife Latifa Kohinoor in 1968 during his M.A. studies at the University of Dhaka. They married on 12 October 1975. Together they had two daughters, Smita and Mauli, and one son, Anannya. Kohinoor died from cancer on 5 September 2024 in Dhaka.

<doc id="622127" wikidata="Q1043534" url="?curid=622127" title="Galaga">
<text>is a 1981 fixed shooter video game developed and published by Namco for arcades. In North America, it was released by Midway Manufacturing. It is the sequel to &quot;Galaxian&quot; (1979), Namco&#x27;s first major video game hit in arcades. Controlling a starship, the player is tasked with destroying the Galaga forces in each stage while avoiding enemies and projectiles. Some enemies can capture a player&#x27;s ship via a tractor beam, which can be rescued to transform the player into a &quot;dual fighter&quot; with additional firepower.

Shigeru Yokoyama led development with a small team. Initial planning took about two months to finish. Originally developed for the Namco Galaxian arcade board, it was instead shifted to a new system as suggested by Namco&#x27;s Research and Development division. Inspiration for the dual fighter mechanic was taken from a film that Yokoyama had seen prior to development, where a ship was captured using a large circular beam. The project became immensely popular around the company, with Namco&#x27;s president Masaya Nakamura even taking interest.

Although early location tests were unsuccessful, &quot;Galaga&quot; received critical acclaim and went on to become one of the most successful arcade games, routinely appearing on Japanese and American arcade charts through 1987. It is widely regarded as a major game from the golden age of arcade video games and one of the greatest video games of all time. Critics applauded its gameplay, innovation, addictive nature and improvements made over its predecessor. Several home ports were released for a multitude of platforms, including the MSX, Atari 7800, and NES, alongside releases on digital distribution platforms such as Xbox Live Arcade. &quot;Galaga&quot; is also included in many Namco compilations. It was followed by a sequel in 1984, &quot;Gaplus&quot;.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Galaga&quot; is a fixed shooter. The player mans a lone starfighter at the bottom of the screen, which must prevent the Galaga forces from destroying all of mankind. The objective of each stage is to defeat all of the Galaga aliens, which will fly into formation from the top and sides of the screen. Similar to &quot;Galaxian&quot;, aliens will dive towards the player while shooting down projectiles; colliding with either projectiles or aliens will result in a life being lost.

Atop the enemy formation are four large aliens known as the &quot;Boss Galaga&quot;, which take two shots to destroy. These aliens can use a tractor beam to capture the player&#x27;s ship, returning with it to the top of the formation and costing the player a life. Should additional lives remain, the player has an opportunity to shoot down the Boss Galaga holding the captured ship. Shooting it down as it dives towards the player will result in the captured ship being rescued, and it will join the player&#x27;s ship, transforming it into a &quot;dual-fighter&quot; with additional firepower and a larger hitbox. However, destroying a Boss Galaga with a captured ship while it is in formation will instead cause the fighter to turn against the player and act as an alien. The ship will return in a later level as part of the formation.

Some enemies can morph into new enemy types with different attack patterns, with one even taking the form of the Galaxian Flagship. Stages are indicated by emblems located at the bottom-right of the screen. Enemies become more aggressive as the game progresses, increasing their number of projectiles and diving down at a faster rate. The third stage and every fourth thereafter is a bonus stage, where the aliens fly in a preset formation without firing at the player.

In the original arcade version, if a player completes stage 255, (The maximum unsigned 8 bit integer) the next stage would be announced as stage 0, and depending on the dip switches on the arcade, the game resets, plays levels incorrectly, locks up, or plays at the wrong difficulty. This is known as a kill screen.

==Development==
&quot;Galaga&quot; was created by Japanese developer Shigeru Yokoyama, a long-time veteran of Namco. Namco&#x27;s first big video game hit in arcades was &quot;Galaxian&quot; (1979); the game&#x27;s success led Namco to produce a large number of Namco Galaxian arcade boards to keep up with demand. By the early 1980s the game was becoming harder to sell, so to help clear out inventory, Yokoyama was tasked with creating two new games that could run on the Namco Galaxian board. The first of these was &quot;King &amp; Balloon&quot; (1980), a fixed shooter that is cited as the first video game to incorporate speech. The second game was instead made for newer hardware as suggested by Namco&#x27;s Research &amp; Development division. This new arcade board was named the Namco Galaga and was used in games including &quot;Bosconian&quot; (1981) and &quot;Dig Dug&quot; (1982). Although Yokoyama was not given explicit instructions to make a shooting game, management expressed desire for him to make a game similar to &quot;Galaxian&quot;. Initial planning for the project took two months.

The idea for the dual fighter stemmed from Yokoyama wanting to create enemies with different attack styles. The tractor beam emitted by the Boss Galaga was inspired by a film in which a character&#x27;s ship was captured by a circling laser. Yokoyama incorporated this idea into &quot;Galaga&quot;, whereby an enemy could capture the player&#x27;s ship with a beam and the ship would need to be rescued. Originally, rescuing a captured ship would award the player an extra life, but this was soon changed to having it fight alongside the player. This idea proved to be a problem at first; due to hardware limitations, the game could only display a limited number of sprites, resulting in the dual-fighter being unable to shoot any more missiles. As a workaround, Yokoyama made a 16x16 sprite for the ship and a 16x16 sprite for the bullets, reducing the total sprite count by two.

Inspired by the intermissions in &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980) and bonus stages in &quot;Rally-X&quot; (1980), Yokoyama added a special bonus level. While planning, lead programmer Tetsu Ogawa informed him of a bug whereby enemies would simply fly off the screen instead of moving into formation. Ogawa expressed interest in incorporating the idea into the game, leading to the inclusion of the Challenging Stages. Enemies originally flew in one type of pattern, with more being added to increase replay value. Graphic designer Hiroshi Ono designed many of the sprites, including the player&#x27;s ship and the Boss Galaga alien.

Prior to location testing, the team focused on designing the instruction card, a sheet of paper that showed how the game was played. The text was done by the planners, while the actual design was handled by a graphic artist. The card originally showed the control layout and the basics of the game, which was stripped early on for being too boring. Yokoyama suggested that the card instead show off the dual fighter mechanic, as a means to draw in players. The team kept bringing in designs to Namco president Masaya Nakamura, who continued to reject them until he ordered the team to simply make it in front of him.

The team was allowed to set their own deadlines, due to Namco&#x27;s then-laidback corporate structure. Feedback on the project was given by Nakamura and other employees, including &quot;Pac-Man&quot; creator Toru Iwatani. Despite the game&#x27;s immense popularity around the company, early location tests failed to meet expectations due to players being able to progress a long way with only one coin, thus generating low income. Although Yokoyama stated that the game&#x27;s popularity could still generate income, Namco executives instructed the team to increase the difficulty level. &quot;Galaga&quot; was released in Japan in September 1981. It was released in North America by Midway Games in October of that year.

===Conversions===
&quot;Sega-Galaga,&quot; the first home conversion of &quot;Galaga,&quot; was developed and published by Sega for the SG-1000 in 1983. An MSX version followed a year later in 1984. A conversion for the Family Computer was released in 1985 for Japan, which was later released internationally by Bandai for the Nintendo Entertainment System, subtitled &quot;Demons of Death&quot; in North America. Atari, Inc. published an Atari 7800 version as one of the console&#x27;s thirteen launch games. In Europe, Aardvark Software released an unofficial port for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron called &quot;Zalaga&quot; in 1983 which was described by &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; as &quot;true to the arcade original&quot;.

Namco published a Game Boy version in Japan in 1995, &quot;Galaxian &amp; Galaga,&quot; bundled with &quot;Galaxian&quot;. Nintendo published the game outside Japan under the &quot;Arcade Classic&quot; brand. Two mobile phone versions were released, both confined to Japan; the first was for i-Mode in 2001, and the second for EZweb in 2006. The original arcade version was released for the Xbox Live Arcade service in 2006, featuring online leaderboards and achievements. The NES release was ported to the Wii Virtual Console in 2007, followed by the arcade version in 2009. A Roku port was published in 2011. In 2013, the NES version was released on both the 3DS and Wii U Virtual Console. &quot;Galaga&quot; was one of the four games released under the &quot;Arcade Game Series&quot; brand, which was published for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Microsoft Windows in 2016.

&quot;Galaga&quot; was included in Namco compilations including &quot;Namco Museum Vol. 1&quot; (1995), &quot;Namco Museum 64&quot; (1996), &quot;Namco Museum 50th Anniversary&quot; (2005), &quot;Namco Museum Virtual Arcade&quot; (2008), &quot;Namco Museum Essentials&quot; (2009), and &quot;Namco Museum Megamix&quot; (2010). The 2010 Wii game &quot;Pac-Man Party&quot; and its 2011 Nintendo 3DS version include &quot;Galaga&quot; as an extra, alongside the arcade versions of &quot;Dig Dug&quot; and &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. In celebration of the game&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2011, a high-definition remake was released for iOS devices as part of &quot;Galaga 30th Collection&quot;, which also included remakes of &quot;Galaxian&quot;, &quot;Gaplus&quot; and &quot;Galaga &#x27;88&quot;. Alongside the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 sequel &quot;Galaga Legions&quot;, it was ported to the Nintendo 3DS in 2011 as part of &quot;Pac-Man &amp; Galaga Dimensions&quot;. The original version was also added to the iOS &quot;Namco Arcade&quot; compilation in 2012. The NES release is one of 30 games included in the NES Classic Edition.

==Reception==

&quot;Galaga&quot; was met with acclaim, with many applauding the addictive nature, gameplay structure, innovation and improvements over its predecessor, and was a popular game during the golden age of arcade video games. In Japan, it was the sixth highest-grossing arcade game of 1981, then the third highest-grossing arcade game of 1982, and then the ninth highest-grossing table arcade cabinet of 1986. In North America, it regularly appeared on the monthly sales chart of &quot;RePlay&quot; magazine from April 1980 to April 1987, being only outdone by Sega&#x27;s &quot;Monaco GP&quot; (1979). &quot;Galaga&quot; was among the top ten highest-grossing arcade games of 1983 in the United States.

&quot;Computer + Video Games&quot; praised the challenge and improvements made over &quot;Galaxian&quot;, while &quot;Arcade Express&quot; selected it as an &quot;Honorable Mention&quot; in their 1983 arcade awards. Japanese publication &quot;Amusement Life&quot; said that the sense of thrill and fast-paced action made &quot;Galaga&quot; a &quot;must play&quot;, while also praising its unique dual-fighter mechanic and colorful graphics. &quot;Vidiot&quot; magazine listed it as the seventh best arcade game of 1983, saying that its gameplay variety, dual-fighter mechanic and bonus stages made it stick out from the crowd.

In a 1998 retrospective review, &quot;AllGame&quot; said the strategy stood out amongst other games of its type, describing the gameplay as &quot;perfectly balanced shooting action.&quot; Reviewing the NES home version, &quot;GameSpy&quot; called &quot;Galaga&quot; a &quot;must play for arcade freaks&quot;, praising the port&#x27;s accurate representation of the arcade version in terms of its graphics, sound effects and gameplay. &quot;IGN&quot; also praised the NES port&#x27;s element of strategy within the dual-fighter mechanic and addictive gameplay. &quot;GameSpot&quot;, in their review for the Xbox 360 release, stated the gameplay was &quot;as tricky as it ever was&quot;, praising the inclusion of online leaderboards and for being a faithful arcade conversion. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; agreed, citing that the leaderboards add to addictiveness.

Ports of &quot;Galaga&quot; received praise for their faithfulness to the arcade original. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; praised the 3DS Virtual Console port of the NES version for remaining accurate to the original, stating that it &quot;aged surprisingly well&quot; and was worth revisiting. &quot;Games&quot; magazine praised the improvements over games such as &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Galaxian&quot;, commenting that &quot;Galaga&quot; still holds up years later. &quot;Joystick&quot; magazine praised the NES version&#x27;s accurate portrayal of the arcade original, notably in its graphics and gameplay structure. &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; commended the Game Boy version&#x27;s faithful conversion alongside its support for the Super Game Boy peripheral, while &quot;Electric Playground&quot; stated that it should &quot; be near the top of your Game Boy&#x27;s next purchase list&quot;. Some publications expressed disappointment towards home releases for lacking extra features. &quot;GameSpot&quot; disliked the lack of online multiplayer in the Xbox 360 release, as well as the lack of an updated graphics setting, saying that the port was &quot;awfully bare bones&quot; compared to other XBLA releases. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; expressed distaste towards the Xbox 360 port&#x27;s high price point, as well as the achievements for being &quot;insultingly easy&quot; to obtain. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; also agreed with &quot;GameSpot&quot; in the lack of online multiplayer.

&quot;Galaga&quot; has been listed by numerous publications among the greatest video games of all time. &quot;Flux&quot; magazine ranked it at #57 on their &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot; in 1995, while &quot;Game Informer&quot; listed it at #23 in their &quot;Top 200 Games of All Time&quot; in 2010. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it at #96 in their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; for its innovation to shoot &#x27;em up games as a whole, and at #17 in their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; labeled it the 19th greatest video game ever made in 2001, calling it the best game of the fixed-shooter genre. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; listed it at #20 in their &quot;100 Best Games of All Time&quot; in 1997 and &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; in 2001, and as #28 in their &quot;Greatest 200 Videogames of Their Time&quot; in 2006. GameFAQs users voted it the 15th greatest game ever made in 2004 and the 10th in 2009. &quot;GameSpy&quot; staff voted it the eighth best arcade game of all time in 2011. It was ranked at #93 in IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; for its addictive gameplay and long-standing appeal. The Killer List of Videogames listed it as #27 in their &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot; list, as well as the 4th most collected arcade game and 2nd most popular on their website. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; listed &quot;Ms. Pac-Man/Galaga - Class of 1981&quot; as the second best arcade game of all time for its inclusion of both games.

==Related media==
Shortly after the game&#x27;s release, Namco produced miniature &quot;Galaga&quot; cabinets for buses and airplanes, housed in small 17-inch CRT monitors. In 2000, Namco released an arcade cabinet to celebrate the game&#x27;s 20th anniversary, which was bundled with &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; and titled &quot;Ms. Pac-Man / Galaga - Class of 1981&quot;. A similar cabinet was released in 2005 that also included the original &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, made to celebrate the latter&#x27;s 25th anniversary. &quot;Galaga&quot; is also included in both &quot;Pac-Man&#x27;s Arcade Party&quot; (2010) and &quot;Pac-Man&#x27;s Pixel Bash&quot; (2019).

&quot;Galaga&quot; has made cameo appearances in films including &quot;WarGames&quot; (1983), &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984), &quot;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&quot; (1987), &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012), and &quot;Pixels&quot; (2015). A submarine named after the game appears throughout the television series &quot;Lost&quot;. Hallmark Cards released a &quot;Galaga&quot; arcade cabinet ornament in 2009, which played sound effects from the game. In 2019, researchers at North Carolina State University named an extinct species of shark &quot;Galagadon nordquistae&quot;, due to the shark&#x27;s teeth bearing a resemblance to the &quot;Galaga&quot; aliens. &quot;Galaga&quot; is also the subject of several high score-based tournaments; as of 2020, the world record is held by Jordan Dorrington with a score of 20,980,450 points.

&quot;Galaga&quot; was used as a loading screen minigame in the PlayStation version of &quot;Tekken&quot;. As a tie-in with the anime series &quot;Space Dandy&quot;, an iOS remake, &quot;Space Galaga&quot;, was released in 2015, featuring characters and starships from &quot;Space Dandy&quot; intermixed with &quot;Galaga&quot; gameplay. A similar crossover game, &quot;Galaga: Tekken Edition,&quot; was released the same year, replacing enemies with characters from the &quot;Tekken&quot; franchise. A &quot;Galaga&quot;-themed costume is also available as downloadable-content in &quot;LittleBigPlanet 3&quot;. The Boss Galaga appears as an item in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot; and its followup &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, where it can capture an opponent and carry them off the screen. &quot;Ultimate&quot; also features a remix of the &quot;Galaga&quot; soundtrack. An animated television adaptation, &quot;Galaga Chronicles&quot;, is confirmed to be in development.
