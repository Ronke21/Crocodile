<doc id="624934" wikidata="Q1240077" url="?curid=624934" title="Machi Tawara">
<text>is a contemporary Japanese writer, translator and poet.

Tawara is most famous as a contemporary poet. She is credited with revitalizing the tanka for modern Japanese audiences. Her skill as a translator consist of translating classical Japanese into modern Japanese, for example books such as the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot; and the &quot;Taketori Monogatari&quot;.

==Biography==
She was born in 1962 in Osaka Prefecture, and moved to Fukui Prefecture when she was 14 years old. In 1981, she graduated from Waseda University with a degree in Japanese literature. Under the influence of the poet Sasaki Yukitsuna, she began to write tanka. After graduation, Tawara began teaching at Kanagawa Prefecture&#x27;s Hashimoto High School, and she taught there until 1989.

She wrote a 50 poem sequence, &quot;August Morning&quot; (八月の朝), which received the 32nd Kadokawa Tanka Prize. She combined this collection with other small groups of tanka to release her first major collection of poems, &quot;Salad Anniversary&quot; (サラダ記念日) in 1987. It became a bestseller, selling well over 2.6 million copies. This collection went on to receive the 32nd Modern Japanese Poets Association Award.

&quot;Salad Anniversary&quot; started a phenomenon known as &quot;salad phenomenon&quot;, comparable to &quot;bananamania&quot; (coined for the phenomenon caused by the first major book of Banana Yoshimoto). Tawara became a celebrity, and hosted television and radio shows where she extolled the virtues of tanka, and encouraged everyone to write them. She eventually released a collection of tanka sent to her by her fans, edited and selected by her.

Tawara&#x27;s popularity is mainly intertwined with her skill with tanka. She deftly combines modern Japanese subjects with classical poetic forms and grammatical constructions, which both hearken back to the classical days but also makes the tanka more accessible to Japan&#x27;s modern youth. Also, as opposed to the tanka of the classical era, Tawara&#x27;s poems possess a lighter attitude and a crisp tone, as well as a universality that helps to make her poetry understood by all.

<text>Gainbridge Fieldhouse is an indoor arena located in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. It opened in November 1999 to replace Market Square Arena. The arena is the home of the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Indiana Fever of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). It also hosts college basketball games (including the annual Big Ten Conference tournaments), indoor concerts, and ice hockey.

The arena was originally named Conseco Fieldhouse, as the naming rights to the venue were sold to Conseco, a financial services organization based in nearby Carmel. In May 2010, the company renamed itself CNO Financial Group, but the fieldhouse retained the Conseco name. In December 2011, CNO Financial Group changed the name of the fieldhouse to Bankers Life Fieldhouse, after one of its subsidiaries, Bankers Life and Casualty. CNO decided not to renew its naming sponsorship after it expired on June 30, 2019. On September 27, 2021, the fieldhouse announced that Indianapolis-based financial platform Gainbridge would be the new naming partner for the fieldhouse in a multi-year partnership.

In April 2019, the Marion County Capital Improvement Board approved a major renovation project for the fieldhouse. The $360 million project will include a new outdoor entry plaza, new indoor gathering areas, and various interior enhancements. The Pacers committed to remaining in Indianapolis for at least 25 more years as part of the renovation agreement. Construction will take place in two phases, with the fieldhouse having planned to host the 2021 NBA All-Star Game in between the phases, which was later canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost all of the construction work took place during the Pacers offseasons. The project displaced the Fever for all of the 2020 and 2021 WNBA seasons, as well as part of the 2022 season; for 2022, the Fever played the first section of the schedule at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, but after the NBA season ended, the Fever played games at Indiana Farmers Coliseum.

The arena was built to evoke an Indiana high school and college field house. As such, unlike most other North American sports arenas, it was designed primarily for basketball. The arena can accommodate an NHL-sized rink, but the ice hockey seating capacity is reduced to 12,300 in an asymmetrical configuration.

==Events==
The first NBA game held at Conseco Fieldhouse was on November 6, 1999, when the Indiana Pacers played their regular-season home opener against the Boston Celtics. Later that same season, the Pacers made it to the 2000 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. Games 3, 4, and 5 of that championship series were held at Conseco Fieldhouse, but the Pacers ended up losing that season&#x27;s title four games to two.

In 2000, the fieldhouse was also the site for the 2000 Ray Miron President&#x27;s Cup finals, with two games of the series being played there. The Indianapolis Ice won the series against the now-defunct Columbus Cottonmouths 4 games to 3.

Several games of the 2002 FIBA World Championship were played at Conseco Fieldhouse, including the semifinals and the final.

In 2009, Conseco Fieldhouse was the site for the 2009 WNBA Finals. The Indiana Fever took on the Phoenix Mercury for games 3 and 4 of that series but ended up losing the series. Three years later, the Fever hosted the 2012 WNBA Finals for games 3 and 4 and beat the Minnesota Lynx.

Additionally, the Indiana Firebirds of the Arena Football League played at the fieldhouse from 2001 to 2004 and the Indianapolis Ice of the Central Hockey League also played at the fieldhouse from 1999 to 2004. The venue also hosted select games for the Indiana Ice of the United States Hockey League.

From 2002 to 2007, the fieldhouse served as the site of the Big Ten Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament in even-numbered years, while the tournament was held at the United Center in Chicago in odd-numbered years. In 2008, the tournament was moved to Conseco Fieldhouse exclusively for five years, through 2012. The arena is also a frequent site of the Big Ten women&#x27;s basketball tournament. 2012 marked the 12th time in 13 years that the tournament had been held at the fieldhouse. On June 5, 2011, the Big Ten Conference announced that beginning in 2013, the location of both of the conference basketball tournaments for the following four years would be alternated between the Chicago area and Indianapolis. Bankers Life Fieldhouse would again be the site for both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s events in 2014 and 2016. The 2011 NCAA Women&#x27;s Final Four was also held at the fieldhouse on April 3 and April 5 of 2011. For basketball, the venue seats 17,923 (18,345 from 1999 to 2006, 18,165 from 2006 to 2016).

From 2011 to 2021, the fieldhouse hosted the Crossroads Classic, an annual event that included the Butler Bulldogs, Indiana Hoosiers, Notre Dame Fighting Irish, and Purdue Boilermakers men&#x27;s basketball teams.

The Professional Bull Riders brought its Built Ford Tough Series bull riding tour, now known as the Unleash the Beast Series, to the fieldhouse for the first time in January 2011. It was their second visit to Indianapolis; they first visited Indianapolis during the 2004 season when they held a BFTS event at the RCA Dome.

Gainbridge Fieldhouse is one of many concert venues in the city of Indianapolis. On March 11, 2019, Metallica set a new attendance record at the venue with 18,274 fans at the venue. The previous record was held by Billy Joel (16,594).

In December 2017, during a press conference the Indiana Pacers announced that the arena would host the 2021 NBA All-Star Game. In late 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other conflicts surrounding the 2021 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament which was also being held in Indianapolis the same year the NBA announced the city would host the 2024 NBA All-Star Game instead of the 2021 game.

=== NCAA tournament ===
Gainbridge Fieldhouse hosted first and second-round games of the 2017, 2022, and 2024 men&#x27;s NCAA tournaments. The arena also hosted first, second, and regional semifinal (Sweet 16) round games of the 2021 men&#x27;s tournament.

==High school sports==
In addition to professional events, the arena also hosts the IHSAA state finals in wrestling as well as both girls and boys basketball. It also occasionally hosts other high school tournaments as well.

==Concerts==
==Wrestling==
WWE has hosted many shows such as &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;.

WCW has hosted the PPV event Sin (2001).

It also hosted many PPV events such as The Great American Bash (2006), SummerSlam (2008), Survivor Series (2012), and Clash of Champions (2016), and most recently Fastlane on October 7, 2023.

The fieldhouse is notable for being the location of many landmark moments for the professional wrestling group The Shield, who debuted on November 18, 2012, at Survivor Series, broke up on the June 2, 2014 episode of &quot;WWE Raw&quot; and reunited on the October 9, 2017 episode of &quot;WWE Raw&quot;.

==Auto racing==
In 2015, the fieldhouse hosted the Indy Invitational, with midget car racing and outlaw kart racing held on a dirt track erected on the arena floor.

==Awards and recognitions==
In 2005 and 2006, Conseco Fieldhouse was ranked the No. 1 venue in the NBA according to the Sports Business Journal/Sports Business Daily Reader Survey. In 2006 The Ultimate Sports Road Trip reaffirmed Conseco Fieldhouse as the best venue in all 4 of the major sports leagues. &quot;The Ultimate Sports Road Trip has recently concluded a re-scoring and re-evaluation of all 122 franchises in the four major sports, based on our personal visits to each of the teams in a journey that began in 1998. Based on our criteria, Conseco Fieldhouse has again withstood scrutiny to be named the &quot;best of the best&quot; in the four major sports. Everything about Conseco Fieldhouse is top notch, a sparkling venue in a sparkling city,&quot; said Farrell and Kulyk.

In October 2004, the fieldhouse hosted the 2004 FINA Short Course World Swimming Championships. A 25-meter 300,000-gallon competition pool and 174,000-gallon warm-up pool were temporarily installed. A total of 71,659 tickets were sold for the four-day event. On the evening of Saturday, October 11, 2004, the crowd set a record for the largest attendance at a U.S. Swimming event outside of the Olympics with 11,488 people.

In 2022, sportswriter Bill Simmons called Gainbridge Fieldhouse &quot;incredible&quot;, saying &quot;the only arena I&#x27;ve ever been in NBA-wise, where I honestly felt like it felt different was the Indiana one, because they built it for basketball only.&quot; He further elaborated by saying &quot;it feels like the fans are on top of the court. The corners come way out toward the baseline. That&#x27;s still my favorite. All these other ones feel like variations [of the same thing].&quot;

==Scoreboard==
In 2012, a giant state-of-the-art scoreboard was added to Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The scoreboard features twin 1080p high definition (HD) video screens, each measuring long – extending nearly foul line to foul line – by high. In addition to the HD screens running the length of the court, the innovative rectangular scoreboard design is capped by a full 1080p HD video screen facing each baseline. The result of the design is a greatly improved visual experience from nearly every seat in the building. Additionally, a new sound system was installed.

==Arena football==
The fieldhouse was home to the Indiana Firebirds of the Arena Football League from 2001 to 2004 after moving from Albany, New York.

<text>Charlotte Emma Moore Sitterly (September 24, 1898 – March 3, 1990) was an American astronomer. She is known for her extensive spectroscopic studies of the Sun and chemical elements. Her tables of data are known for their reliability and are still used regularly.

==Early life and education==

Charlotte Moore was born to George W. and Elizabeth Walton Moore in Ercildoun, Pennsylvania, a small village near Coatesville. Her father was the Superintendent of Schools for Chester County and her mother was a schoolteacher. Her parents were Quakers and Charlotte was a lifelong member of Fallowfield Friends Meeting.

She attended Swarthmore College, where she participated in many extracurricular activities such as ice hockey, student government, glee club, and tutoring. In order to pay her tuition, Moore was a substitute teacher, one of the few ways she thought she could work her way through college. She wanted to pursue a career outside teaching because &quot;I did not enjoy the teaching that I did from first grade through high school. I succeeded at it, but I didn’t like it; it was too wearing.&quot;

Moore graduated from Swarthmore in 1920 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics and went on to Princeton to work as a human computer.

==Career==

On the recommendation of her mathematics professor at Swarthmore, John. Miller, Moore obtained a job at the Princeton University Observatory working for Professor Henry Norris Russell as a human computer carrying out calculations needed to use photographic plates in determining the position of the Moon. While working for Russel, Moore initially felt nervous about her inexperience, but over time her interest in astrophysics began to blossom. Russell and Moore researched binary stars and stellar mass, and published extensively on the subject over the years of their collaboration. Her research included an effort to classify 2500 stars based on their spectra.

Although she spent five years at Princeton working under Russell, he refused to consider her a PhD, an unexceptional fact since there were no women in any of Princeton&#x27;s graduate programs until 1961. Moore said “I was used to prejudice against women because Princeton was a man&#x27;s stronghold, and a woman was really out of step there.” Though in 1926, Russell left his own name off a paper they worked on together and used hers alone.

After five years at Princeton, Moore took a leave of absence due to ill health and she moved to the Mount Wilson Observatory as part of an ongoing collaboration between Russell and research groups there. While at Mount Wilson she worked extensively on solar spectroscopy, analyzing the spectral lines of the Sun and thereby identifying the chemical elements in the Sun. With her collaborators, she analyzed the spectra of sunspots. Moore was able to deduce the temperature of sunspots to be about 4,700 kelvins. Her pictures from the Mount Wilson Observatory helped redetermine the new International Angstrom scale.

She earned a Ph.D. in astronomy in 1931 from the University of California, Berkeley, which had more relaxed rules on women graduates than Princeton, on a Lick Fellowship. Princeton still did not accept women – and would not for the next 30 years. While working on her Ph.D, she continued researching spectroscopy and collected and analyzed data about the spectra of chemical elements and molecules. After obtaining her Ph.D, she returned to Princeton to continue work with Russell as a research assistant.

One of her most significant contributions to physics was her identification of technetium in sunlight, the first example of technetium naturally existing. She joined the then National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in 1945. Her tables of atomic spectra and energy levels, published by NBS, have remained essential references in spectroscopy for decades. While there, she began to research the infrared solar spectrum and atomic energy levels. Beginning in 1946, Moore was able to extend her work on ultraviolet spectral lines thanks to the work of Richard Tousey and measurements taken on V-2 rockets; prior to this Moore&#x27;s studies were limited to telescopic observations partially blocked by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Moore collaborated with Tousey for decades and led to her 1950 publication &quot;Ultraviolet Multiplet Table.&quot;

In 1949 she became the first woman elected as an associate of the Royal Astronomical Society of Great Britain, in honor of her work on multiplet tablets and in identifying solar spot electra. Throughout her career she authored and co-authored over 100 papers and attended the tenth general assembly of the International Astronomical Union on the Joint Commission on Spectroscopy in Moscow in 1958. Sitterly retired from her position at the NBS when she turned 70, in 1968, but continued her research at the Naval Research Laboratory. Sitterly was honored by the &quot;Journal of the Optical Society of America&quot; by a commemorative issue in 1988.

==Personal life==

While working at Princeton in the 1920s, she met physicist Bancroft W. Sitterly, whom she eventually married on May 30, 1937. She continued to publish journals under her maiden name because most of her recognition was under that name. She believed that traveling is one of the most important aspects of a scientist&#x27;s life, as it promotes collaboration between scientists. She enjoyed gardening, traveling, and music with her husband until his death in 1977. She continued her research until her death from heart failure at the age of 91.

<text>Barmouth (formal ; colloquially ) is a seaside town and community in the county of Gwynedd, north-west Wales; it lies on the estuary of the Afon Mawddach and Cardigan Bay. Located in the historic county of Merionethshire, the Welsh form of the name is derived from &quot;aber&quot; (estuary) and the river&#x27;s name, &quot;Mawddach&quot;. The English form of the name is a corruption of the earlier Welsh form &quot;Abermawdd&quot;. The community includes the villages of Llanaber, Cutiau and Caerdeon.

== History ==

The town grew around the shipbuilding industry, and more recently as a seaside resort. Notable buildings include the medieval tower house, the 19th century roundhouse prison and St John&#x27;s Church.

William Wordsworth, a visitor to Barmouth in the 19th century, described it thus: &quot;With a fine sea view in front, the mountains behind, the glorious estuary running inland, and within compass of a day&#x27;s walk, Barmouth can always hold its own against any rival.&quot;

 (Citadel of Light), which is located east of the town on the adjoining hillside, was the first tract of land to be donated to the National Trust. Panorama Walk, to the east of the town, was developed as a coastal footpath in the Victorian era to contribute to the town&#x27;s attractions for visitors. The walk is designated at Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales. On the route of the walk stands the Glan-y-Mawddach estate. Originally a Regency villa, the house, which is listed at Grade II, was extended in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and an important garden laid out which is designated at Grade II* on the Cadw/ICOMOS register.

Barmouth features prominently in the novel &quot;Austerlitz&quot; by Max Sebald. The town is featured in an idyllic light, with the narrator visiting several times during his childhood [see box].

In January 2014, two trains were stranded at Barmouth after severe winter storms destroyed the sea wall at nearby .

==Transport==

The town is served by Barmouth railway station. Transport for Wales operate northbound services to via , and ; eastbound services travel to Birmingham International via , , , , and .

Connections for southbound services to and can be made at Dovey Junction or Machynlleth. Barmouth Bridge, which takes the Cambrian Line over the River Mawddach, was also previously at the end of the Ruabon–Barmouth line; this line passed through Bala and Dolgellau. The southern end of the bridge is now the start of the Mawddach Trail, a cycle path and walkway that uses the old trackbed.

Local bus services are provided by Lloyds Coaches and link the town with nearby destinations such as Harlech, Tan-y-Bwlch, Porthmadog and Dolgellau. Cross-country bus services are available to Wrexham via Bala, Corwen and Llangollen, as part of the Welsh Government funded TrawsCymru network.

The Barmouth Ferry sails from Barmouth to Penrhyn Point, where it connects with the narrow-gauge Fairbourne Railway for the village of Fairbourne. The town has a RNLI lifeboat station, which includes a visitors&#x27; centre with shop and viewing gallery.

==Sport==
The nearest rugby club is in Dolgellau, away. Barmouth has one major football team: Barmouth &amp; Dyffryn United, which competes in the Welsh Alliance League. Barmouth is the venue for the annual Barmouth Beach Race, a motocross event. Usually taking place on the last weekend in October, the event sees riders take part in beach racing, using a temporary motocross course constructed on the beach. Over 200 riders typically take part in this event, with spectators attending free of charge. The event attracts champion riders from England and Wales. The harbour hosts the annual Three Peaks yacht race.

<text>CNO Financial Group, Inc. (formerly Conseco, Inc. (from Consolidated National Security Corporation)) is an American financial services holding company based in Carmel, Indiana. Its insurance subsidiaries provide life insurance, annuity and supplemental health insurance products to more than four million customers in the United States. These products are distributed through independent agents, career agents and direct to customers through television advertising and direct mail.

CNO Financial Group is the parent company of seven insurance companies, including Bankers Life and Casualty Company and Colonial Penn Life Insurance Company. They also own 40/86 Advisors, an investment management company and Washington National Insurance Company.

==History==
CNO Financial was incorporated in 1979 as Security National of Indiana Corp. by Stephen Hilbert. SNI bought Consolidated National Life Insurance Co. in 1983. It began insurance operations in 1982 and became a public company in 1985.

In 1986, Conseco acquired Lincoln Income Life Insurance Company at $29 per share for $32.3 million. Shearson Lehman Brothers advised Lincoln Income Life Insurance. Earlier, in mid-1985, Lincoln had agreed to be acquired by I.C.H. for $31 per share in cash but the merger could not be consummated as the Kentucky Department of Insurance raised objections to certain expenses which Lincoln would have incurred in the merger. Lincoln also received a merger proposal from Redgate in 1985. Satisfied with its recipe for acquiring and improving insurance companies, Conseco stepped up its acquisition efforts in 1986. It purchased Bankers National Life Insurance Company for $118 million, respectively.

In 1998, Conseco purchased the former Greentree Financial, one of the largest financiers of mobile homes, in an attempt to diversify into consumer financial services. They also bought life insurance company Colonial Penn later that year, changing their name to Conseco Direct Life, though changing the name back to Colonial Penn in 2001 (known as Bankers Conseco Life Insurance Company in New York state). Conseco (though not its subsidiary insurance companies) entered Chapter 11 reorganization in 2002 and emerged nine months later in 2003. Conseco&#x27;s bankruptcy was the third largest U.S. Chapter 11 filing at the time, after the bankruptcies of WorldCom Inc. and Enron. In the process of reorganization, GreenTree was divested and thereafter Conseco solely focused on the insurance industry.

From its opening in 1999 until 2011, the company (when it was known as Conseco) held the naming rights to the home arena of the NBA&#x27;s Indiana Pacers; the naming rights were transferred to Bankers Life in 2011.

On May 11, 2010, the board of directors officially approved changing the holding company&#x27;s name to CNO Financial Group. CNO Financial ranked 608 on the Fortune 1000 with 2014 revenues of $4.1 billion.

In February 2015, CNO Financial sold its Hyderabad-based India operations to Cognizant.

<text>Horton is a township in eastern Ontario, Canada, at the confluence of the Bonnechere River and the Ottawa River in Renfrew County. The Town of Renfrew was originally part of Horton Township.

==Communities==
The township comprises the communities of Castleford, Castleford Station, Cotieville, Fergusons Beach, Goshen, Lochwinnoch (partially), Mayhew and Thompson Hill.

===Castleford===
In the 1820s, Lt. Christopher James Bell settled his land grant and named the area Castleford after his birthplace in West Yorkshire, England.
A post office opened at Castleford in 1832, but the town was renamed Warnock in 1889 when the Castleford designation was given to the CPR station at Castleford Station. In 1891 the community name reverted to Castleford.
The town of Castleford is the first of five chutes along the Bonnechere River. The others being Renfrew, Douglas, Fourth Chute and Eganville. The chutes used were for moving timber past rapids and waterfalls.

===Castleford Station===
In 1889 the Castleford designation was also given to the CPR station at Castleford Station. Both communities were named after Castleford in West Yorkshire, England.
===Goshen===
Goshen is a former railway stop on a now abandoned line, probably named for the Land of Goshen, the Hebrew name of an area in the Nile delta in Ancient Egypt.

===Lochwinnoch===
The community of Lochwinnoch was named for the town of Lochwinnoch in Renfrewshire, Scotland.
==History==
In 1826, the township opened for settlement, and by 1830, it had a population of 21. It was named after Robert Wilmot-Horton, a British member of Parliament who advocated immigration to Canada, and incorporated as a township municipality in 1850.

In 1858, the township lost part of its territory when the village of Renfrewville (renamed to Renfrew in 1895) was incorporated to form a separate village municipality.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Horton had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="624953" wikidata="Q1347053" url="?curid=624953" title="R. Gordon Wasson">
<text>Robert Gordon Wasson (September 22, 1898 – December 23, 1986) was an American author, ethnomycologist, and a Vice President for Public Relations at J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. 

Wasson spent most of his career in banking in his position at J.P. Morgan. Later in his life, despite having little formal training in the field, he turned his interests to the study of hallucinogenic mushrooms, religion, and ethnomycology, publishing papers that received attention and acclaim. In the course of work funded by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Wasson made contributions to the fields of ethnobotany, botany, and anthropology. He is perhaps most famous for the problem of the botanical identity of soma–haoma in the ancient Aryan religion. Wasson suggested that &quot;soma&quot; described in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; was the fly agaric mushroom, and &quot;haoma&quot; in the &quot;Avesta&quot; was a hallucinogen.

== Career ==

=== Banking industry ===
Wasson began his banking career at Guaranty Trust Company in 1928, and moved to J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. in 1934. That same year, he published a book on the Hall Carbine Affair, in which he attempted to exonerate John Pierpont Morgan from guilt with respect to the incident, which had been viewed as an example of wartime profiteering. As early as 1937, Wasson had been attempting to influence historians Allan Nevins and Charles McLean Andrews regarding Morgan&#x27;s role in the affair; he used Nevins&#x27; report as a reference for his own book on the topic. The matter of Morgan&#x27;s responsibility for the Hall Carbine Incident remains controversial.

On July 16, 1941, the directors of Morgan &amp; Co. appointed Wasson to the position of assistant secretary, and by 1943 he was vice president for public relations.

=== Ethnomycology ===

Wasson&#x27;s studies in ethnomycology began during his 1927 honeymoon trip to the Catskill Mountains when his wife, Valentina Pavlovna Guercken, a pediatrician, chanced upon some edible wild mushrooms. Fascinated by the marked difference in cultural attitudes towards fungi in Russia compared to the United States, the couple began field research that led to the publication of &quot;Mushrooms, Russia and History&quot; in 1957. 

In the course of their investigations they mounted expeditions to Mexico to study the religious use of mushrooms by the native population, and claimed to have been the first Westerners to participate in a Mazatec mushroom ritual.

It was the &quot;curandera&quot; María Sabina who both allowed the Wassons to participate in the ritual and who taught them about the uses and effects of the mushroom, after Wasson lied to her about being worried about the whereabouts and wellbeing of his son, as the ritual was traditionally used to locate missing people and important items. Sabina let him take her picture on the condition that he keep it private, but Wasson nonetheless published the photo along with Sabina&#x27;s name and the name of the community where she lived. Though he faced no consequences for his deceptions, and indeed, profited greatly from the knowledge he gained from her, Sabina was subsequently ostracised from her community as a result of his actions, and her house was burned down after she was briefly jailed, her son murdered, and she eventually died in poverty. 

At the 1951 annual meeting of the American Council of Learned Societies, held in Rye, New York, on January 24-26, Wasson was appointed a member of the Executive Committee for a period of one year.

Some of Wasson&#x27;s colleagues, such as Ethel Dunn, disagreed with Wasson&#x27;s conclusions regarding &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;.

==== CIA funding ====
Wasson&#x27;s 1956 expedition was funded by the CIA&#x27;s MK-Ultra subproject 58, as was revealed by documents obtained by John Marks under the Freedom of Information Act. The documents state that Wasson was an &quot;unwitting&quot; participant in the project. 

The funding was provided under the cover name of the &quot;Geschickter Fund for Medical Research&quot; (credited by Wasson at the end of his subsequent &quot;Life&quot; piece about the expedition).

== Role in popularizing psilocybin mushrooms ==
In May 1957, &quot;Life&quot; magazine published an article titled &quot;Seeking the Magic Mushroom,&quot; which introduced psychoactive mushrooms to a wide audience for the first time. Six days later, his wife Valentina&#x27;s first-person account of their research expedition in Mexico was published on the cover of &quot;This Week,&quot; a Sunday magazine inserted in 37 newspapers that reach almost 12 million total readers.

In his memoir, author Tom Robbins talks about the impact of this article on &quot;turning on&quot; Americans himself included. The article sparked immense interest in the Mazatec ritual practice among beatniks and hippies, an interest that proved disastrous for the Mazatec community and for María Sabina in particular. As the community was besieged by Westerners wanting to experience the mushroom-induced hallucinations, Sabina attracted attention by the Mexican police who thought that she sold drugs to the foreigners. The unwanted attention completely altered the social dynamics of the Mazatec community and threatened to terminate the Mazatec custom. The community blamed Sabina, and she was ostracized in the community and had her house burned down. Sabina later regretted having introduced Wasson to the practice, but Wasson contended that his only intention was to contribute to the sum of human knowledge.

=== Methodology ===
Together, Wasson and botanist Roger Heim collected and identified various species of family &quot;Strophariaceae&quot; and genus &quot;Psilocybe&quot;, while Albert Hofmann, using material grown by Heim from specimens collected by the Wassons, identified the chemical structure of the active compounds, psilocybin and psilocin. Hofmann and Wasson were also among the first Westerners to collect specimens of the Mazatec hallucinogen &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot;, though these specimens were later deemed not suitable for rigorous scientific study or taxonomic classification. Two species of mushroom, &quot;Psilocybe wassonii&quot; R.Heim and &quot;Psilocybe wassoniorum&quot; Guzman &amp; S.H.Pollock, were named in honor of Wasson by Heim and Gastón Guzmán, the latter of whom Wasson met during an expedition to Huautla de Jiménez in 1957.

Wasson&#x27;s next major contribution was a study of the ancient Vedic intoxicant soma, which he hypothesized was based on the psychoactive fly agaric (&quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;) mushroom. This hypothesis was published in 1967 under the title &quot;Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immortality&quot;. His attention then turned to the Eleusinian Mysteries, the initiation ceremony of the ancient Greek cult of Demeter and Persephone. In &quot;The Road to Eleusis: Unveiling the Secret of the Mysteries&quot; (1978), co-authored with Albert Hofmann and Carl A. P. Ruck, it was proposed that the special potion &quot;kykeon&quot;, a pivotal component of the ceremony, contained psychoactive ergoline alkaloids from the fungus Ergot (&quot;Claviceps spp.&quot;).

Several of his books were self-published in illustrated, limited editions, using handmade paper and printed in Italy, that have never been reprinted, with one exception. His last completed work, &quot;The Wondrous Mushroom&quot;, initially part of the self-published works, was republished by City Lights Publishers in 2014.

==Ethnography==
Prior to his work on soma, theologians had interpreted the Vedic and Magian practices to have been based on alcoholic beverages that produced inebriation. Wasson was the first researcher to propose that the actual form of Vedic intoxication was entheogenic.

==Legacy==
Wasson donated his personal papers as a gift to the Harvard University Botanical Museum, as part of the &quot;Tina and Gordon Wasson Ethnomycological Collection.&quot; The thoroughly curated array of books, papers, and artifacts contained in the collection was fully settled into its new adoptive home by April 1982.

Wasson&#x27;s obituary in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; stated that together with his wife and co-author, Valentina P. Wasson, he had &quot;illuminated the sanctity of psychotropic mushrooms, not only in Russia and Siberia, but also in the most ancient of Hindu scriptures, in the mystery cults of ancient Greece and among the native peoples of Mexico and Guatemala, both ancient and modern.&quot;

In 2015, the Mycological Society of America (MSA) created a new award named for both Gordon and Valentina in order to recognize non-professionals and people with non-traditional academic backgrounds who have made outstanding contributions to mycology. The first &quot;Gordon and Tina Wasson Award&quot; was presented to Paul Stamets on July 29, 2015, by the organization&#x27;s former president, D. Jean Lodge, during the MSA meeting in Edmonton, Canada.

<text>Sir Clive Hubert Lloyd CM (born 31 August 1944) is a Guyanese-British former cricketer and captain of the West Indies cricket team. Lloyd is widely regarded as one of the greatest captains of all time. As a boy he went to Chatham High School in Georgetown. At the age of 14 he was captain of his school cricket team in the Chin Cup inter-school competition. One of his childhood memories is of sitting in a tree outside the ground overlooking the sightscreen watching Garry Sobers score two centuries for West Indies v Pakistan. Lloyd captained the West Indies in three World Cups, winning in 1975 (with Lloyd scoring a century) and 1979 while losing the 1983 final to India.

In 1971 he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. He captained the West Indies between 1974 and 1985 and oversaw their rise to become among the greatest Test and One Day International teams of the 20th century. He is one of the most successful Test captains of all time: during his captaincy the side had a run of 27 matches without defeat, which included 11 wins in succession (Viv Richards acted as captain for one of the 27 matches, against Australia at Port of Spain in 1983–84). He was the first West Indian player to earn 100 international caps.

Lloyd was a 6&#x27; 5&quot; powerful middle-order batsman with stooping shoulders, and occasional medium-pace bowler. In his youth he was also a strong cover point fielder. He wore his famous glasses as a result of being poked in the eye with a ruler.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWOS/ref&quot;&gt; &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; Cricket Yearbook 1985 – &quot;Farewell Super Cat&quot; written by Ian Chappell, pp: 110–13, PBL Marketing, Pty Ltd, 1985. ISSN 0813-7439 &lt;/ref&gt; His Test match debut came in 1966. Lloyd scored 7,515 runs at Test level, at an average of 46.67. He hit 70 sixes in his Test career, which is the 14th highest number of any player. He played for his home nation of Guyana in West Indies domestic cricket, and for Lancashire (he was made captain in 1981) in England. Lloyd was the first West Indian player to take a wicket on his first ball on ODI debut. He is a cousin of spin bowler Lance Gibbs. Since retiring as a player, Lloyd has remained heavily involved in cricket, managing the West Indies in the late 1990s, and coaching and commentating. He was an ICC match referee from 2001 to 2006.

In 2009, Lloyd was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He was knighted in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to cricket.

== Early life ==
Lloyd grew up in Georgetown, British Guiana, where his father worked as a chauffeur for a local doctor. He was the second oldest of two boys and four girls. Lloyd was the captain of the Chatham High School cricket team from the age of 14. His father died in 1958, and Lloyd left school to work in the administrative section of the Georgetown hospital to help support the family at age 16. He then played club cricket for Demerara Cricket Club. He first represented British Guiana in 1964.

==Career==

Lloyd made his Test debut during the West Indian tour to India on 13 December 1966 against India. He scored 82 in the first innings and 78 not out in the second. After the tour to India, Lloyd joined Haslingden and played in the Lancashire League. Lloyd said of it &quot;It was a real culture shock when I first got there because it was pretty cold. It was windy and raining and I hadn&#x27;t been that cold in my life&quot;. He scored 861 runs in 1967 and then 1226 runs in 1968. He said of the experience &quot;...it gave you a chance to hone your skills and your technique because the conditions were so different than what I was used to&quot;. He also played for the Derrick Robin&#x27;s XI in 1967. He then played for Lancashire from 1968 until 1986. Lloyd scored 521 runs in John Player league matches in 1970 at an average of 57.88 and Lancashire won both the John Player&#x27;s League and Gillette Cup in 1970.

In 1971–72, Lloyd suffered a back injury while playing for a Rest of the World team at the Adelaide Oval. He was fielding in the covers when Ashley Mallett hit a lofted drive towards his area. He made an effort to take the catch but it bounced out of his hands when he hit the ground awkwardly. When he went to get up, he felt a stabbing pain in his back and he was unable to move. He spent the next few weeks in an Adelaide hospital flat on his back. Lloyd was able to return to the West Indies in February 1972 and played for Guyana against Barbados on 26 February and scored 60 runs. He then scored 133 and 104 not out for Guyana against the touring New Zealand team. He was recalled to play for the West Indies in the fourth test against New Zealand and was run out for 43 runs in the first innings. This led to bottles being thrown on the pitch. Lloyd had to go to the radio commentary team and broadcast an appeal for calm which allowed the game to be restarted 20 minutes later.

In the fifth test match in Mumbai against India in 1975, Lloyd scored his highest first-class score of 242 not out. This helped the West Indies win the final test match after the series was tied (2-2) after first four matches. Lloyd batted for 429 minutes and had a 250 run partnership with Deryck Murray. Lloyd said of the innings: &quot;I went past 200 and really felt that I could have got to 300 that day had not a crowd riot halted play. What happened was that a lone spectator, a young lad in his teens, jumped the fence and came on to shake my hand after I got 200. Since it was not a mass invasion, I thought nothing of it but the police had other ideas. In front of everyone they used their long bamboo sticks, the lathis, with a vengeance on the poor boy and incensed the crowd to such an extent that, by tea, there was a full-scale riot which left the place looking like a battlefield. We remained in our dressing room and were never in any danger&quot;.

In the 1975 Cricket World Cup Final against Australia, the West Indies were deep in trouble at 3/50 when Lloyd strode to the crease. He duly made 102 from 85 balls, the only limited overs international century of his career. Lloyd was described as &quot;more than able to handle everything the Australians threw at him after his team’s sedate start&quot;. At one stage during his innings, he hooked Dennis Lillee for six runs. With Rohan Kanhai he added 149 for the West Indies to win by 17 runs. Play ended at 8:40pm and was the longest day&#x27;s play ever at Lord&#x27;s.

The 1975–76 West Indies tour of Australia was considered a disappointment for the West Indies as they lost the test series 5–1. Lloyd however had a successful tour with the bat scoring 469 runs at an average of 46.9. The humiliation of the defeat in Australia coupled with the incessant racism encountered during the matches documented in Fire in Babylon, served as an impetus for Lloyd to nurture fast bowling talent and remake the existing image of West Indian cricket from &quot;Caribbean crowd pleasers&quot; to fierce competitors and winners. Subsequently, the quartet of Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Joel Garner and Colin Croft heralded an era of unprecedented success for West Indian cricket, in which they avenged all their humiliating losses to Australia and England.

Lloyd captained the West Indies on their tour of New Zealand in 1979. He said of the tour &quot;We were jaded and Viv Richards had gone home with a sore back&quot;. The tour was noted for some controversial umpiring decisions and bad blood between the teams. Lloyd said &quot;They were just bad umpires but we should not have behaved in that manner. I think if I&#x27;d had my time over again I&#x27;d have handled it differently. I regret it even until this day, that things went so far&quot;.

On 22 January 1985, Lloyd was made an honorary Officer of the Order of Australia for his services to the sport of cricket, particularly in relation to his outstanding and positive influence on the game in Australia.

In 2005, Lloyd offered his patronage to Major League Cricket for their inaugural Interstate Cricket Cup in the United States, to be named the Sir Clive Lloyd Cup. His son, Jason Clive Lloyd, was a goalkeeper for the Guyana national football team. In 2007, Lloyd&#x27;s authorised biography, &quot;Supercat&quot;, was published. It was written by the cricket journalist Simon Lister.

In 2022, Lloyd received a knighthood at an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle.

Clive is regarded as one of the greatest captains in the history of the game.

==Personal life==

Lloyd is a fan of English football club Everton FC.

<text>Atlanticism, also known as Transatlanticism, is the ideology which advocates a close alliance between nations in Northern America (the United States and Canada) and in Europe on political, economic, and defense issues. The term derives from the North Atlantic Ocean, which is bordered by North America and Europe.

The term can be used in a more specific way to refer to support for North Atlantic military alliances against the Soviet Union, or in a more expansive way to imply broader cooperation, perceived deeply shared values, a merging of diplomatic cultures, as well as a sense of community and some degree of integration between North America and Europe. In practice, the philosophy of Atlanticism encourages active North American, particularly American, engagement in Europe and close cooperation between states on both sides of the ocean. Atlanticism manifested itself most strongly during the Second World War and in its aftermath, the Cold War, through the establishment of various Euro-Atlantic institutions, most importantly NATO and the Marshall Plan, with the purpose being to maintain or increase the security and prosperity of the participating countries during the Cold War and protect liberal democracy and the progressive values of an open society that unite them under multiculturalism.

Atlanticism varies in strength from region to region and from country to country based on a variety of historical and cultural factors. It is often considered to be particularly strong in Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Ireland and the United Kingdom (linked to the Special Relationship). Politically, it has tended to be associated most heavily and enthusiastically but not exclusively with classical liberals or the political right in Europe. Atlanticism often implies an affinity for U.S. political or social culture, or affinity for Europe in North America, as well as the historical bonds between the two continents.

There is some tension between Atlanticism and continentalism on both sides of the Atlantic, with some people emphasising increased regional cooperation or integration over trans-Atlantic cooperation. The relationship between Atlanticism and North American or European integrations is complex, and they are not seen in direct opposition to one another by many commentators. Internationalism is the foreign policy belief combining both Atlanticism and continentalism.

== History ==
Prior to the World Wars, western European countries were generally preoccupied with continental concerns and creating colonial empires in Africa and Asia, and not relations with North America. Likewise, the United States was busy with domestic issues and interventions in Latin America, but had little interest in European affairs, and Canada, despite gaining self-governing dominion status through Confederation in 1867, had yet to exercise full foreign policy independence as a part of the British Empire.

Following World War I, New York lawyer Paul D. Cravath was a noted leader in establishing Atlanticism in the United States. Cravath had become devoted to international affairs during the war, and was later a co-founder and director of the Council on Foreign Relations. In the aftermath of World War I, while the US Senate was discussing whether or not to ratify the Treaty of Versailles (it ultimately did not), some Congressional Republicans expressed their support for a legally binding US alliance with Britain and France as an alternative to the League of Nations&#x27;s and especially Article X&#x27;s open-ended commitments; however, US President Woodrow Wilson never seriously explored their offer, instead preferring to focus on his (ultimately unsuccessful) fight to secure US entry into the League of Nations.

The experience of having American and Canadian troops fighting with British, French, and other Europeans in Europe during the World Wars fundamentally changed this situation. Though the U.S. (and to some extent Canada) adopted a more isolationist position between the wars, by the time of the Normandy landings the Allies were well integrated on all policies. The Atlantic Charter of 1941 declared by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill established the goals of the Allies for the post-war world, and was later adopted by all the Western allies. Following the Second World War, the Western European countries were anxious to convince the U.S. to remain engaged in European affairs to deter any possible aggression by the Soviet Union. This led to the 1949 &quot;North Atlantic Treaty&quot; which established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the main institutional consequence of Atlanticism, which binds all members to defend the others, and led to the long-term garrisoning of American and Canadian troops in Western Europe.
After the end of the Cold War, the relationship between the United States and Europe changed fundamentally, and made the sides less interested in each other. Without the threat of the Soviet Union dominating Europe, the continent became much less of a military priority for the U.S., and likewise, Europe no longer felt as much need for military protection from the U.S. As a result, the relationship lost much of its strategic importance.

However, the new democracies of the former Warsaw Pact, and parts of the fragments of the fractured Yugoslavia, took a different view, eagerly embracing Atlanticism, as a bulwark against their continued fear of the Soviet Union&#x27;s key now-separate great power fragment: Russia.

Atlanticism has undergone significant changes in the 21st century in light of terrorism and the Iraq War, the net effect being a renewed questioning of the idea itself and a new insight that the security of the respective countries may require alliance action outside the North Atlantic territory. After the September 11, 2001, attacks, NATO for the first time invoked Article 5, which states that any attack on a member state will be considered an attack against the entire group of members. Planes of NATO&#x27;s multi-national AWACS unit patrolled the U.S. skies and European countries deployed personnel and equipment. However, the Iraq War caused fissures within NATO and the sharp difference of opinion between the U.S.-led backers of the invasion and opponents strained the alliance. Some commentators, such as Robert Kagan and Ivo Daalder questioned whether Europe and the United States had diverged to such a degree that their alliance was no longer relevant. Later, in 2018, Kagan said that &quot;we actually need the United States to be working actively to support and strengthen Europe&quot;.

The importance of NATO was reaffirmed during Barack Obama&#x27;s administration, though some called him relatively non-Atlanticist compared to predecessors. As part of the Obama Doctrine, Washington supported multilateralism with allies in Europe. Obama also enforced sanctions on Russia with European (and Pacific) allies after Russia&#x27;s first invasion of Ukraine in Crimea. After his presidency, Obama also stressed the Atlantic alliance&#x27;s importance during the Trump administration, indirectly opposing Trump in the matter. 

During the Trump years, tensions rose within NATO, as a result of democratic backsliding in Hungary and Turkey, and Trump&#x27;s comments against NATO members and the alliance. Robert Kagan echoed common criticisms that Trump undermined the alliance. Despite this, NATO gained two new member countries (Montenegro and North Macedonia) during that time. The importance of NATO in Europe increased due to the continuing threat of the Russian military and intelligence apparatus and the uncertainty of Russian actions in former Soviet Union countries, and various threats in the Middle East. German-Russian economic relations became an issue in the Atlantic relationship due to Nord Stream 2, among other disagreements such as trade disputes between the United States and the European Union. 

As the Biden administration began, top officials of the European Union expressed optimism about the Atlantic relationship. Following the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, journalists noted that the Russian aggression led to a united political response from the European Union, making the defensive relevance of the Atlantic alliance more widely known, and increasing the popularity of NATO accession in countries like Sweden and Finland. Finland joined NATO on 4 April 2023 and Sweden on 7 March 2024.
==Ideology==
Atlanticism is a belief in the necessity of cooperation between North America and Europe. The term can imply a belief that the bilateral relationship between Europe and the United States is important above all others, including intra-European cooperation, especially when it comes to security issues. The term can also be used &quot;as a shorthand for the transatlantic security architecture.&quot;

Supranational integration of the North Atlantic area had emerged as a focus of thinking among intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic already in the late 19th century. Although it was not known as Atlanticism at the time (the term was coined in 1950), they developed an approach coupling soft and hard power which would to some extent integrate the two sides of the Atlantic. The idea of an attractive &quot;nucleus&quot; union was the greatest soft power element; the empirical fact of the hegemonic global strength such a union would hold was the hard power element. This approach was eventually implemented to a certain degree in the form of NATO, the G7 grouping and other Atlanticist institutions. 

In the long debate between Atlanticism and its critics in the 20th century, the main argument was whether deep and formal Atlantic integration would serve to attract those still outside to seek to join, as Atlanticists argued, or alienate the rest of the world and drive them into opposite alliances. The Atlanticist perspective that informed the scheme of relations between the United States and the Western European countries after the end of World War Two was informed by political expedience and a strong civilizational bond. Realists, neutralists, and pacifists, nationalists and internationalists tended to believe it would do the latter, citing the Warsaw Pact as the proof of their views and treating it as the inevitable realpolitik counterpart of NATO.

Broadly speaking, Atlanticism is particularly strong in the United Kingdom (linked to the Special Relationship) and eastern and central Europe (i.e. the area between Germany and Russia). There are numerous reasons for its strength in Eastern Europe: primarily the role of the United States in bringing political freedom there after the First World War (Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points), the major role of the U.S. during the Cold War (culminating in the geopolitical defeat of the Soviet empire and its withdrawal from the region), its relative enthusiasm for bringing the countries of the region into Atlanticist institutions such as NATO, and a suspicion of the intentions of the major Western European powers. Some commentators see countries such as Poland and the United Kingdom among those who generally hold strong Atlanticist views, while seeing countries such as Germany and France tending to promote continental views and a strong European Union.

In the early 21st century, Atlanticism has tended to be slightly stronger on the political right in Europe (although many variations do exist from country to country), but on the political center-left in the United States. The partisan division should not be overstated, but it exists and has grown since the end of the Cold War.

While trans-Atlantic trade and political ties have remained mostly strong throughout the Cold War and beyond, the larger trend has been continentalist economic integration with the European Economic Area and the North American Free Trade Agreement notably dividing the Atlantic region into two rival trade blocs. However, many political actors and commentators do not see the two processes as being necessarily opposed to one another, in fact some commentators believe regional integration can reinforce Atlanticism. Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty, added by Canada, also attempted to bind the nations together on economic and political fronts.

==Institutions==

The North Atlantic Council is the premier, governmental forum for discussion and decision-making in an Atlanticist context. Other organizations that can be considered Atlanticist in origin:
* NATO
* Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
* G-6/7/8
* North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC)
* Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC)
* The German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF)
* European Horizons
* The Atlantic Council

The World Bank and International Monetary Fund are also considered Atlanticist. Under a tacit agreement, the former is led by an American and the latter European.

==Prominent Atlanticists==
Well-known Atlanticists include former U.S. Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and Ronald Reagan; U.K. Prime Ministers Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, and Gordon Brown; former U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson; former Assistant Secretary of War and perennial presidential advisor John J. McCloy; former U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski; former NATO Secretaries-General Javier Solana and Joseph Luns; and Council on Foreign Relations co-founder Paul D. Cravath.

<text>Renfrew is a town on the Bonnechere River in Renfrew County, Ontario, Canada. Located one hour west of Ottawa in Eastern Ontario, Renfrew is the fourth largest town in the county after Petawawa, Pembroke and Arnprior. The town is a small transportation hub connecting Highway 60 and Highway 132 with the Trans-Canada Highway. Renfrew is also known historically for its role in the formation of the National Hockey League. It lies about 5 kilometres from the Quebec border, about 10 kilometres by road. Renfrew makes most of Canada’s hockey tape.

==History==
Named after Renfrewshire, Scotland, in approximately 1848, Renfrew was settled largely in part due to logging in the area in the early 19th century, where the river was used in order to drive the lumber to locations such as Ottawa. This heritage was until recently celebrated every July with the Lumber Baron Festival.

==Geography==
Renfrew and the surrounding Township of Horton are at the intersection of the Bonnechere River and the Ottawa River in the Ottawa Valley. Renfrew is at the intersection of provincial Highway 17, Highway 60, and Highway 132.

The town of Renfrew is the second of five chutes along the Bonnechere River. The others being Castleford, Douglas, Fourth Chute and Eganville. The chutes used were for moving timber past rapids and waterfalls.

=== Climate ===
Renfrew has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with four distinct seasons, warm summers, cold snowy winters and no dry season.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Renfrew had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
Mother tongue (2021):
* English: 93.4%
* French: 2.8%
* English and French: 0.7%
* Other: 2.6%

==Economy==
Much of Renfrew&#x27;s current prosperity can be attributed to its status as an economic centre for a surrounding rural region with a population of over 30,000. Renfrew is also an important stop for Ottawa-based cottagers and outdoor enthusiasts passing by on their way to nearby whitewater rafting, boating, camping, hunting, golfing, fishing, snowmobiling, down-hill skiing, and cross-country skiing. However, the area&#x27;s largest single employers are the Renfrew Victoria Hospital and the Bonnechere Manor. In addition to numerous small employers, there are also several manufacturing facilities employing several hundred people; Scapa Tapes Renfrew (formerly Renfrew Tape) makes products such as hockey tape that is used across North America and the duct tape brand featured on the discontinued Red Green Show and promoted by Doug Gilmour in the early 1990s after becoming a member of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Times Fibre Canada and Madawaska Hardwood Flooring also have manufacturing facilities in town. Haley Industries located outside Renfrew near Haley Station is also a major employer in the area. Renfrew is also home to many successful small businesses. Between 2000 and 2005, a major portion of Renfrew&#x27;s retail business, and the associated customer services jobs, shifted from the west-end Renfrew mall (now demolished) to its east-end industrial park near Highway 17 due to the opening of several major big-box such as No Frills and Walmart and smaller retail stores.

Residents of the area await the twinning of Highway 17 to improve traffic flow and the safety of the highway due to numerous accidents along the corridor to North Bay, Ontario.

Despite the apparent prosperity, Statistics Canada reported the average earnings of Renfrew residents in 2000 as $35,811, or roughly 31% lower than the provincial average and 5% lower than the county average. Further, the town reports, relative to the population size and compared to the province as a whole, fewer positions in management, business, finance, administration and natural or applied sciences, while there was greater than the provincial rates of occupation in sales and service, trades, transport and equipment operators, processing, manufacturing and utilities.

==Festivals==
* Renfrew was the annual host and sponsor of the Ottawa Valley Lumber Baron Festival, a celebration of the town&#x27;s roots in the logging industry. The Lumber Baron Festival is now known as Valleyfest, dropping its historical roots.
* The Renfrew Fair has been drawing mixed crowds for decades with its mid-way rides, exhibits, demolition derby, musical acts and livestock showcase. The fair takes place on the second weekend of every September and lasts from Wednesday afternoon through Sunday afternoon. The rides are supplied by the company Bungsey Shows.
* There is a nearby Blue Grass music festival that takes place every year in the middle of July.
*In 2008, Renfrew celebrated its sesquicentennial throughout the calendar year.

==Landmarks==
===Low Square===
Low Square is located at the corner of Raglan Street and Railway Avenue in downtown Renfrew. The square is a park setting containing the cenotaph, and the Town Hall. In 1918, with approval of Council, and at his own expense, the Honourable Thomas Low donated and landscaped the property as a gift to the town for the purpose of constructing a cenotaph to honour local soldiers who died in The Great War, but he died before it was unveiled. The Renfrew Police station (later the OPP detachment) was built as a small brown brick building on the back of the square officially opening October 15, 1970, replacing the station directly to the south of it (formerly the Albion Hotel). A new town hall was constructed as an addition to the police station, in 1985, with municipal offices moving from the old Temperance Hall building directly across the street. In February 2017, the full building became town hall offices and Ontario Court of Justice offices when the police moved to a new location at 450 O&#x27;Brien Road. The name of Tom Low lives on in the Park he landscaped, which A.A. Wright declared &quot;from this time on and for all time to be known as Low Square”.

===McDougall Mill Museum===

John Lorn McDougall, politician and fur trader, built the mill in 1855 by the Bonnechere River near the town landmark Swinging Bridge and overlooking natural rapids below the Renfrew Power Generation generating station. It has been converted into a museum, sometimes referred to as &#x27;Renfrew Museum&#x27;, not to be confused with museums of that name in Pennsylvania and Scotland. The McDougall Mill Museum houses pioneer tools and machinery, a military section, a doll exhibit, as well as toys, Victorian clothing and household items.

===Swinging Bridge===

In 1885, the W.H. Kearney family built a wire bridge across the Bonnechere River. The “swinging bridge”, now a town landmark made of wood and cable, is far safer and more secure than the original plank and wire structure. Reconstructed in 1983 by the Town of Renfrew and updated in 2015, it is one of three swinging bridges in Canada and provides an excellent view of the Bonnechere River and the power generation plant.

===Entertainment===
* The O&#x27;Brien Theatre opened on June 25, 1930, and was owned and operated by Ottawa Valley Amusements, Renfrew entrepreneur M. J. O&#x27;Brien. The opening movie, &quot;Sally&quot;, was a comedy starring Marilyn Miller. Admission for adults was 45 cents and for children it was 20 cents. The elegantly decorated town landmark was converted from a live theatre to a movie theatre and 1990s upgrades modified the balcony to accommodate a second screen. The building still maintaining much of the original appeal, reopened after extensive renovations, on January 7, 1994 with &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;, starring Robin Williams.

==Services==

===Churches===
* Calvary Pentecostal Church
* Christian Reformed Church
* Our Lady of Fatima
* Parkview Free Methodist Church
* Renfrew Baptist Church
* Renfrew &amp; District Ministerial Association
* Renfrew Presbyterian Church
* Salvation Army
* St. Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church
* St. James Lutheran Church
* St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church
* Trinity St. Andrew&#x27;s United Church

===Health Care Facilities===
* Bonnechere Manor
* Chartwell Quail Creek Retirement Residence
* Hospice Renfrew Inc.
* Miramachi Lodge
* Renfrew Victoria Hospital opened in 1897, having 12 beds for contagious disease. By 1912, bed capacity rose to 30 and the Renfrew Victoria Hospital became a Public General Hospital. In January 1926, a tragic fire destroyed the original building, which was replaced by a new 50 bed hospital later that year. The Hospital was under Municipal ownership until 1961 when a special act of parliament transferred it from civic authority to an independent corporation known as the Board of Governors, composed of representatives from the Town of Renfrew and surrounding Townships. In October 1963, the hospital grew to 101 treatment beds after a major building and renovation program. In November 1978 another renovation project took place which was completed in April 1980. A new Dialysis Unit serving Renfrew County was completed in 1994, able to accommodate the needs of 48 patients. This Unit was again expanded in 1999 with an addition to the Hospital. In November 2001, a new Emergency/Ambulatory Care wing was opened, adding 13,000 square feet to the existing hospital, then in March 2015 a 23,000 square foot Nephrology Centre was completed. This consolidated every aspect of patient&#x27;s care for kidneys - education, clinics and treatment - in the same area of the hospital.

The Victoria Hospital School of Nursing opened in 1902 with a capacity of 30 students, graduating 10 students per year. Nursing education moved under the jurisdiction of community colleges and the school was subsequently closed in 1965.

===Policing===
The Town of Renfrew is policed by the Ontario Provincial Police force.

Chief Bernard &quot;Barney&quot; McDermott had the job as Chief of Police in Renfrew from 1890 until his retirement in 1909 - he was a one man police force and was known to always &quot;get his man&quot;. His living quarters were situated above the fire hall in Renfrew.

The Renfrew Police station (later the OPP detachment) was built on the back of Low Square in 1972.

The OPP operated out of their Stewart Street location from 1967 until moving into the Low Square detachment when the Town of Renfrew police service amalgamated with the OPP in 2000. The Renfrew and Arnprior detachments, who both faced the same fate of losing their own town operated forces, had their OPP detachments amalgamated in January 2013, and in February 2017, a new regional detachment was opened at 450 O&#x27;Brien Road in Renfrew. This new Renfrew detachment serves the towns of Arnprior, Renfrew, and the townships of Greater Madawaska, McNab-Braeside, Admaston-Bromley, Horton and about half of Whitewater Region Township.

===Post Office===

The Renfrew Post Office, built in 1908, is located at 249 Raglan Street South. Built in the Romanesque Revival style with exterior walls of irregularly coursed split-faced stone and mansard roof clad in seamed copper, this beautiful edifice is a major landmark on Renfrew&#x27;s main throughfare. The tapered silhouette of the metal-clad clock tower, hipped gable roof and weather vane tops the stone structure that has twinned principal entrances with metal coats of arms located above. Located below the top centre window is the engraving E.R. 1908, representing the monarch at the time of construction. The interior consists of hardwood finishes, terrazzo tile floors, plaster ceilings and walls with wood dados. Over the years, the building has shared use of the post office, customs and revenue offices, and the NHA/NHL Birthplace Museum. In 2018, the building was sold by the town to Rob Thompson Hotels Ltd. for the price tag of $100,000 with the proposal of a boutique hotel in the upper levels of the building, while retaining the post office on the main level and numerous conditions to keep the historical features intact.

===Public Library===

The Renfrew Public Library had rather simple beginnings; a group of residents discussing the latest philosophies and varied topics in William Dickson&#x27;s cobbler shop which opened up in 1845 near the current location of the post office. After gathering up a few books in 1852, Mr. Dickson, Mr. Archie Thompson, and local lawyer, Mr. Elkanah Billings formed the &quot;Renfrew Mechanics Institute and Library Association&quot;, which lasted for about fifteen years before being revitalized in 1870 by a new group of people. By the end of the century, the Institute emerged as a newly formed Public Library Board and the books were moved to the Barnet Block at 282 Raglan Street, above what was James Clark&#x27;s drugstore. The current building located at 13 Railway Avenue, was opened in 1920 with financial support from the Carnegie Institute, and in 1959, the Children&#x27;s Library was established in the completely renovated basement. In the 1980s, the library became wheelchair accessible by an addition at the east and south side of the building, which also expanded the research and reading area into the second floor of the adjacent building at 161 Raglan Street.

==Sports==

===Facilities===
The town&#x27;s main sports complex, Ma-te-way Centre was built in 1989 replacing the aging Renfrew Arena.

===Golf===
The Renfrew Golf Club was founded in 1929, as nine holes, and was expanded to 18 holes in the mid-1970s.

===Hockey===
One of the four original teams in the National Hockey Association, the precursor to the NHL, was based in Renfrew. The Renfrew Creamery Kings sought to be allowed to play in the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association, but with no success. The team&#x27;s owner, M. J. O&#x27;Brien, eventually financed and put together his own league, the NHA. The Creamery Kings played two seasons of hockey in the NHA, 1911 and 1912, until M. J. O&#x27;Brien pulled out to pursue his interests in the railway.

Renfrew Timberwolves is the town&#x27;s hockey team since 1987, but the team can trace its roots back to 1968 as the Renfrew Lions or Renfrew Junior Timberwolves. The current team plays in the Central Canada Hockey League Tier 2.

<doc id="624976" wikidata="Q640665" url="?curid=624976" title="V-3 cannon">
<text>The V-3 () was a German World War II large-caliber gun working on the multi-charge principle whereby secondary propellant charges are fired to add velocity to a projectile. Two full-size guns were built in the underground Fortress of Mimoyecques in northern France and permanently aimed at London, but they were rendered unusable by Allied bombing raids before completion. Two smaller guns were used to bombard Luxembourg from December 1944 to February 1945.

The V-3 was also known as the &quot;Hochdruckpumpe&quot; (&quot;High Pressure Pump,&quot; HDP for short), which was a code name intended to hide the real purpose of the project. It was also known as &quot;Fleißiges Lieschen&quot; (&quot;Busy Lizzie&quot;).

==Description==
The gun used multiple propellant stages placed along the barrel&#x27;s length in order to provide an additional boost. These were ignited by the hot gases that propelled the projectile as it passed them. Solid-fuel rocket boosters were used instead of explosive charges because of their greater suitability and ease of use. These were arranged in symmetrical pairs along the length of the barrel, angled to project their thrust against the base of the projectile as it passed. This layout spawned the German codename &quot;Tausendfüßler&quot; (&quot;millipede&quot;).

The barrel and side chambers were designed as identical sections to simplify production and allow damaged sections to be replaced. The entire gun would use multiple such sections bolted together. The smoothbore gun fired a fin-stabilized shell that depended upon aerodynamic forces rather than gyroscopic forces to prevent tumbling (as distinct from conventional rifled weapons which cause the projectile to spin).

==Background==
The basic idea of the multi-charge concept is that in a traditional single-charge gun the pressure in the barrel is at its peak when the charge is fired, and then continuously dwindles to some much lower value as the shell travels down the barrel and the combustion gasses expand. This requires a traditional gun to be much heavier at the breech end in order to successfully contain this pressure, and as the gun grows in power, the weight becomes untenable. The multi-charge concept uses a low-power initial charge and continues adding more charges as the shell moves along the barrel, resulting in a much more constant pressure as the shell moves. This reduces peak pressure and the need to have a heavy breech, as well as providing smoother acceleration.

The origin of the multi-chamber gun dates back to the 19th century. In 1857, U.S. inventor Azel Storrs Lyman (1815–1885) was granted a patent on &quot;Improvement in accelerating fire-arms&quot;, and he built a prototype in 1860 which proved to be unsuccessful. Lyman then modified the design in collaboration with James Richard Haskell, who had been working for years on the same principle.

Haskell and Lyman reasoned that subsidiary propellant charges could increase the muzzle velocity of a projectile if the charges were spaced at intervals along the barrel of a gun in side chambers and ignited an instant after a shell had passed them. The &quot;Lyman-Haskell multi-charge gun&quot; was constructed on the instructions of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Chief of Ordnance, but it did not resemble a conventional artillery piece. The barrel was so long that it had to be placed on an inclined ramp, and it had pairs of chambers angled back at 45 degrees discharging into it.

It was test-fired at the Frankford Arsenal at Philadelphia in 1880 and was unsuccessful. The flash from the original propellant charge bypassed the projectile due to faulty obturation and prematurely ignited the subsidiary charges before the shell passed them, slowing the shell down. The best velocity that could be obtained from it was , inferior to the performance of a conventional RBL 7 inch Armstrong gun of the same period. New prototypes of multi-charge guns were built and tested, but Lyman and Haskell abandoned the idea.

During the same period, French engineer Louis-Guillaume Perreaux, one of the pioneers of the motorcycle, had been working on a similar project since before 1860. Perreaux was granted a patent in 1864 for a multi-chamber gun. In 1878, Perreaux presented his invention at the World Exhibition of Paris.

==Development==
In 1918, the French Army made plans for a very long range multi-chamber gun in response to the German Paris Gun. The Paris Gun was built by Friedrich Krupp AG and could bombard Paris from German lines over a distance of . The French initiative did not reach the prototype stage. It was discontinued and the plans archived when the retreat of the German armies and the armistice put an end to the bombardment.

France collapsed in June 1940 at the beginning of World War II, and German troops acquired the plans of this long-range gun. In 1942, this patent attracted the attention of August Coenders, developer of the Röchling shell and chief engineer of the plants &quot;Röchling Stahlwerk AG&quot; in Wetzlar, Germany. Coenders thought that the gradual acceleration of the shell by a series of small charges spread over the length of the barrel might be the solution to the problem of designing very long range guns. The very strong explosive charge needed to project shells at a high speed was causing rapid degradation of the gun tubes of conventional guns.

Coenders proposed the use of electrically activated charges to eliminate the problem of the premature ignition of the subsidiary charges as experienced by the Lyman-Haskell gun. Coenders built a prototype of a 20 mm multi-chamber gun using machinery readily available at the Wetzlar plant to produce tubes of this calibre for the Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns of 20 mm. The first tests were encouraging, but to get the support of the Ministry of arms, Hermann Röchling had to present to Albert Speer Coenders&#x27; project of a cannon capable of firing on London from the coast of the Pas-de-Calais. The project intended to use two batteries to crush London under a barrage of hundreds (per hour) of shells with an explosive charge of .

Speer told Adolf Hitler about the proposal in May 1943. After the Royal Air Force (RAF) bombed the Peenemünde rocket center on 17 August, Hitler agreed to Speer&#x27;s suggestion that the gun be built without more tests. Coenders constructed a full-calibre gun at the Hillersleben proving ground near Magdeburg but, by the end of 1943, he had encountered severe problems both in putting the gun&#x27;s basic principle into operation and in producing a feasible design for the shells that it was to fire. Even when everything worked, the muzzle velocity was just over , which was nowhere near what had been promised. Nonetheless, a proposal was made to build a single full-sized gun with a barrel at Misdroy on the Baltic island of Wolin, near Peenemünde, while construction went ahead at the Mimoyecques site in France, which had already been attacked by the USAAF and the RAF. The &quot;Heereswaffenamt&quot; (Weapon Procurement Office) took control of the project by March 1944, and, with no good news from Misdroy, Coenders became one of the engineers working on the three chief problems: projectile design, obturation, and ignition of the secondary charges.

Six different companies produced satisfactory designs for projectiles, including Krupp and Škoda Works. Obturation problems were solved by placing a sealing piston between the projectile and the initial propellant charge, which prevented the flash from the charge from getting ahead of the projectile, and solved the problem of controlling the initiation of the secondary charges. By the end of May 1944 there were four designs for the 150 mm finned projectile, one manufactured by Fasterstoff (designed by Füstenberg) and three others by Röchling (Coenders), Bochumer (Verein-Haack), and Witkowitz Ironworks (Athem).

Trials were held at Misdroy from 20–24 May 1944 with ranges of up to being attained. On 4 July 1944, the Misdroy gun was test-fired with 8 rounds; one of the long shells travelled . The gun burst during the testing, putting an end to the tests.

==Mimoyecques site==
Major Bock of Festung Pioneer-Stab 27 (the fortification regiment of LVII Corps, Fifteenth Army, at the time based in the Dieppe area) was given the task of finding a suitable site for the HDP batteries following Hitler&#x27;s decision that HDP guns should be sited in northern France to bombard London. A study in early 1943 concluded that a hill with a rock core would be most suitable, as the gun tubes could be placed in drifts (inclined tunnels) and support equipment and supplies located in adjacent tunnels. The guns would not be movable and would be permanently aimed at London.

A suitable site was selected at a limestone hill about north of the Hidrequent quarries, near Mimoyecques in the Pas-de-Calais region of northern France behind Cap Gris Nez, where V-1 and V-2 launch sites were already under construction. The site was from the sea and from London. It was code-named &quot;Wiese&quot; (meadow) and &quot;Bauvorhaben 711&quot; (Construction Project 711), and Organisation Todt began construction in September 1943 with the building of railway lines to support the work, and began to excavate the gun shafts in October. The initial layout comprised two parallel facilities about apart, each with five drifts which were to hold a stacked cluster of five HDP gun tubes, for a total of 50 guns. Both facilities were served by an underground railway tunnel and underground ammunition storage galleries.

The eastern complex consisted of five drifts angled at 50 degrees reaching below the hilltop. The five drifts exited the hilltop through a concrete slab wide and thick. Large steel plates protected the five openings, and each drift had a special armoured door. Extensive tunnels and elevator shafts supported the guns and, if the site had become operational, about 1,000 troops from Artillerie Abteilung 705 and supporting units would have been deployed at Mimoyecques. Artillerie Abteilung 705 had been organised in January 1944 under Oberstleutnant Georg Borttscheller to operate the Wiese gun complex.

The plans were to have the first battery of five gun tubes ready for March 1944, and the full complex of 25 gun tubes by 1 October 1944. A failure occurred at the Misdroy proving ground in April 1944 after only 25 rounds had been fired and, as a result, the project was further cut back from five drifts to three, although work had begun on some of the other drifts.

The site was finally put out of commission on 6 July 1944, when bombers of RAF Bomber Command&#x27;s 617 Squadron (the famous &quot;Dambusters&quot;) attacked using &quot;Tallboy&quot; deep-penetration &quot;earthquake&quot; bombs.

==Luxembourg bombardment==
The project eventually came under the control of the SS, and SS General Hans Kammler ordered it to be ready for action in late 1944, assisted by Walter Dornberger. A battery was constructed of two shorter or &#x27;half-barrel&#x27; V-3 guns approximately long with 12 side-chambers, and it was placed in the hands of the army artillery unit &quot;Artillerie Abteilung 705&quot; under the command of Hauptmann (Captain) Patzig. These were sited in a wooded ravine of the Ruwer River at Lampaden about southeast of Trier in Germany.

The two guns were aimed west, resting on 13 steel support structures on solid wooden bases on a 34 degree slope. The city of Luxembourg (which had been liberated in September 1944) was at a range of about and was designated Target No. 305. Concrete blockhouses were constructed between the two gun tubes, as well as ten smaller bunkers to hold projectiles and propellant charges.

The assembly and mounting of the Lampaden guns coincided with the final preparations for the Battle of the Bulge. The supply of ammunition became problematic due to the state of the German railway network. Time had become critical, and it was decided to use a finned projectile with a discarding sabot, weighing and carrying a explosive charge. The propellant comprised a main charge and 24 subsidiary charges for a total of .

By the time that the Ardennes offensive began on 16 December 1944, Kammler received orders from OB West (German Army Command in the West) to begin firing at the end of the month, and the first gun tube was ready for action on 30 December 1944. Two warm-up rounds were initially fired, followed by five high-explosive shells which were fired in sequence, attended by Kammler. The muzzle velocity was approximately .

The second gun tube was brought into operation on 11 January 1945 and 183 rounds in total were fired until 22 February 1945, with 44 confirmed hits in the urban area. From the 142 rounds that struck Luxembourg, total casualties were 10 dead and 35 wounded.

==Fate==
One of the two Lampaden guns was dismantled on 15 February 1945 , and firing ceased on 22 February, when US Army units had advanced to within of the Lampaden site.

A second battery of guns began to be deployed in January 1945 at Buhl, aimed at Belfort in support of the Operation Nordwind offensive. One gun was erected before the failure of the Nordwind offensive put the site at risk, and the equipment was removed before firing could begin.

There were other proposals to deploy batteries to bombard London, Paris, Antwerp and other cities, but they were not implemented due to the poor state of the German railway network and a lack of ammunition. All four HDP guns were eventually abandoned at the Röchling works in Wetzlar and Artillerie Abteilung 705 was re-equipped with conventional artillery. The disassembled gun tubes, spare parts, and remaining ammunition were later captured by the US Army and shipped to the United States where they were tested and evaluated at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, and scrapped there in 1948.

==Museum==
The Mimoyecques museum allows visitors to view the galleries (in various stages of construction and bombing damage), remains of the guns, a small scale V-3 replica, and examples of machinery, rail systems and tools employed. The site also contains memorials to the slave labourers who were forced by the Nazis to construct it and to the airmen killed in action during the destruction of the base.

The Misdroy site also has a museum.

==Scale model==
Hugh Hunt of Cambridge University, together with explosives engineer Charlie Adcock, created a working scale model of the V-3 gun and was able to prove the ignition of the propellants was done by the advancing gas behind the projectile.

<doc id="624981" wikidata="Q503396" url="?curid=624981" title="Substitution reaction">
<text>A substitution reaction (also known as single displacement reaction or single substitution reaction) is a chemical reaction during which one functional group in a chemical compound is replaced by another functional group. Substitution reactions are of prime importance in organic chemistry. Substitution reactions in organic chemistry are classified either as electrophilic or nucleophilic depending upon the reagent involved, whether a reactive intermediate involved in the reaction is a carbocation, a carbanion or a free radical, and whether the substrate is aliphatic or aromatic. Detailed understanding of a reaction type helps to predict the product outcome in a reaction. It also is helpful for optimizing a reaction with regard to variables such as temperature and choice of solvent.

A good example of a substitution reaction is halogenation. When chlorine gas (Cl2) is irradiated, some of the molecules are split into two chlorine radicals (Cl•), whose free electrons are strongly nucleophilic. One of them breaks a C–H covalent bond in CH4 and grabs the hydrogen atom to form the electrically neutral HCl. The other radical reforms a covalent bond with the CH3• to form CH3Cl (methyl chloride).

==Nucleophilic substitution==

In organic (and inorganic) chemistry, nucleophilic substitution is a fundamental class of reactions in which a nucleophile selectively bonds with or attacks the positive or partially positive charge on an atom or a group of atoms. As it does so, it replaces a weaker nucleophile, which then becomes a leaving group; the remaining positive or partially positive atom becomes an electrophile. The whole molecular entity of which the electrophile and the leaving group are part is usually called the substrate.

The most general form for the reaction may be given as 
:&lt;chem&gt;Nuc\mathbf{:}- + R-LG -&gt; R-Nuc{} + LG\mathbf{:}-&lt;/chem&gt;
where indicates the substrate. The electron pair (:) from the nucleophile (Nuc:) attacks the substrate (), forming a new covalent bond . The prior state of charge is restored when the leaving group (LG) departs with an electron pair. The principal product in this case is . In such reactions, the nucleophile is usually electrically neutral or negatively charged, whereas the substrate is typically neutral or positively charged.

An example of nucleophilic substitution is the hydrolysis of an alkyl bromide, , under basic conditions, where the &quot;attacking&quot; nucleophile is the base and the leaving group is :
:&lt;chem&gt;R-Br + OH- -&gt; R-OH + Br-&lt;/chem&gt;
Nucleophilic substitution reactions are commonplace in organic chemistry, and they can be broadly categorized as taking place at a carbon of a saturated aliphatic compound carbon or (less often) at an aromatic or other unsaturated carbon center.

=== Mechanisms ===
Nucleophilic substitutions can proceed by two different mechanisms, unimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN1) and bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2). The two reactions are named according tho their rate law, with SN1 having a first-order rate law, and SN2 having a second-order.

The SN1 mechanism has two steps. In the first step, the leaving group departs, forming a carbocation (C+). In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization.

The stability of a carbocation (C+) depends on how many other carbon atoms are bonded to it. This results in SN1 reactions usually occurring on atoms with at least two carbons bonded to them. A more detailed explanation of this can be found in the main SN1 reaction page.

The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.

SN2 attack may occur if the backside route of attack is not sterically hindered by substituents on the substrate. Therefore, this mechanism usually occurs at an unhindered primary carbon center. If there is steric crowding on the substrate near the leaving group, such as at a tertiary carbon center, the substitution will involve an SN1 rather than an SN2.

Other types of nucleophilic substitution include, nucleophilic acyl substitution, and nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Acyl substitution occurs when a nucleophile attacks a carbon that is doubly bonded to one oxygen and singly bonded to another oxygen (can be N or S or a halogen), called an acyl group. The nucleophile attacks the carbon causing the double bond to break into a single bond. The double can then reform, kicking off the leaving group in the process.

Aromatic substitution occurs on compounds with systems of double bonds connected in rings. See aromatic compounds for more.

== Electrophilic substitution ==

Electrophiles are involved in electrophilic substitution reactions, particularly in electrophilic aromatic substitutions.

In this example, the benzene ring&#x27;s electron resonance structure is attacked by an electrophile E+. The resonating bond is broken and a carbocation resonating structure results. Finally a proton is kicked out and a new aromatic compound is formed.

Electrophilic reactions to other unsaturated compounds than arenes generally lead to electrophilic addition rather than substitution.

== Radical substitution ==
A radical substitution reaction involves radicals. An example is the Hunsdiecker reaction.

==Organometallic substitution==
Coupling reactions are a class of metal-catalyzed reactions involving an organometallic compound RM and an organic halide R′X that together react to form a compound of the type R-R′ with formation of a new carbon–carbon bond. Examples include the Heck reaction, Ullmann reaction, and Wurtz–Fittig reaction. Many variations exist.

== Substituted compounds ==
Substituted compounds are compounds where one or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced with something else such as an alkyl, hydroxy, or halogen. More can be found on the substituted compounds page.

==Inorganic and organometallic chemistry==
While it is common to discuss substitution reactions in the context of organic chemistry, the reaction is generic and applies to a wide range of compounds. Ligands in coordination complexes are susceptible to substitution. Both associative and dissociative mechanisms have been observed.

Associative substitution, for example, is typically applied to organometallic and coordination complexes, but resembles the Sn2 mechanism in organic chemistry. The opposite pathway is dissociative substitution, being analogous to the Sn1 pathway. 

Examples of associative mechanisms are commonly found in the chemistry of 16e square planar metal complexes, e.g. Vaska&#x27;s complex and tetrachloroplatinate. The rate law is governed by the Eigen–Wilkins Mechanism.
Dissociative substitution resembles the SN1 mechanism in organic chemistry. This pathway can be well described by the &quot;cis&quot; effect, or the labilization of CO ligands in the &quot;cis&quot; position. Complexes that undergo dissociative substitution are often coordinatively saturated and often have octahedral molecular geometry. The entropy of activation is characteristically positive for these reactions, which indicates that the disorder of the reacting system increases in the rate-determining step. Dissociative pathways are characterized by a rate determining step that involves release of a ligand from the coordination sphere of the metal undergoing substitution. The concentration of the substituting nucleophile has no influence on this rate, and an intermediate of reduced coordination number can be detected. The reaction can be described with k1, k−1 and k2, which are the rate constants of their corresponding intermediate reaction steps:

:&lt;chem&gt;L_\mathit{n}M-L &lt;=&gt;[-\mathrm L, k_1][+\mathrm L, k_{-1}] L_\mathit{n}M-\Box -&gt;[+\mathrm L&#x27;, k_2] L_\mathit{n}M-L&#x27;&lt;/chem&gt;
Normally the rate determining step is the dissociation of L from the complex, and [L&#x27;] does not affect the rate of reaction, leading to the simple rate equation:

:&lt;chem&gt; Rate = {\mathit k_1 [L_\mathit{n}M-L]}&lt;/chem&gt;

<doc id="624986" wikidata="Q454251" url="?curid=624986" title="Jimmy Johnstone">
<text>James Connolly Johnstone (30 September 1944 – 13 March 2006) was a Scottish footballer who played as an outside right. Known as &quot;Jinky&quot; for his elusive dribbling style, Johnstone played for Celtic for 13 years and was one of the Lisbon Lions, the team that won the 1967 European Cup Final. Johnstone also won nine consecutive Scottish championships. He scored 129 goals for Celtic in 515 appearances and was voted the club&#x27;s greatest-ever player by fans in 2002.

Johnstone also won 23 caps for Scotland. He finished third in voting for the 1967 Ballon d&#x27;Or and was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame when it was inaugurated in 2004.

Rodger Baillie of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; called Johnstone a &quot;genius who lived by magic and mischief&quot;, while Hugh McIlvanney wrote that no other player &quot;besieged opponents with such a complex, concentrated swirl of deceptive manoeuvres or ever conveyed a more exhilarating sense of joy in working wonders with the ball.&quot;

==Early life and youth career==
Johnstone was the youngest of five children born to Matthew and Sarah Johnstone. He grew up in the family home on Old Edinburgh Road in Viewpark, North Lanarkshire, and he was educated at St Columba&#x27;s primary school in Viewpark and then at St John&#x27;s secondary school in Uddingston.

His footballing ability first came to note at primary school, playing for the St Columba&#x27;s team that won three trophies in 1953–54. The team at his secondary school, St John&#x27;s, were less able, but their physical education teacher, Tommy Cassidy, was a friend of Sammy Wilson, who played for Celtic at the time and had scored in Celtic&#x27;s 7–1 win over Rangers in the 1957 Scottish League Cup Final. Cassidy used his connections to get Johnstone a role as ball boy at Celtic.

At home, he used to dribble around milk bottles every day in the hallway for hours to perfect his skills. On reading that Stanley Matthews used to walk to Blackpool&#x27;s ground wearing heavy boots to strengthen his leg muscles, Johnstone began wearing pit boots and would sprint and play football in them. He later said that this &quot;probably added about three yards on to my pace.&quot;

Despite the thrill of being involved with Celtic as a ballboy, Johnstone wanted to play football. As a result, he left Celtic to play for his local Boys Guild team. As well as playing locally, the team travelled down to play Manchester United&#x27;s boys&#x27; team. Johnstone&#x27;s ability caught the eye of the English giants but, upon his return to Scotland, Celtic scout John Higgins persuaded him to sign for Celtic; He signed youth terms on the same day as left-back Tommy Gemmell, who lived a few miles away and would also have a long association with the club. In order to gain experience, Johnstone was farmed out to junior club Blantyre Celtic.

==Club career==
===Celtic===
Johnstone made his first team debut for Celtic on 27 March 1963 in a 6–0 defeat away against Kilmarnock in the league. His next appearance came a month later, away against Hearts. He was again on the losing side (4–3), but scored his first senior goal. Despite the defeats, Johnstone&#x27;s performances won him a place in the team for the Scottish Cup Final on 4 May 1963 against Rangers. The young winger turned in a fine performance, helping Celtic to a creditable 1–1 draw with his confident dribbling. He also scored a goal but it was disallowed due to a foul moments earlier by teammate John Hughes. Johnstone was dropped for the replay and Celtic were outclassed by Rangers, who ran out comfortable 3–0 winners.
The following season saw Johnstone establish himself as a regular in the side. He played in 25 league games, scoring six goals. He also helped Celtic reach the semi-finals of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, scoring against FC Basel in a 5–0 win at Parkhead in the first round, and then against MTK Budapest in a 3–0 win in the first leg of the semi-final. Celtic, however, lost 4–0 in the return match in Hungary and were knocked out on aggregate.

Celtic were struggling throughout the 1960s until Jock Stein arrived at the club in 1965. By this time Johnstone was struggling to hold down a regular spot in the first team. On arrival at Celtic, Stein had doubts about Johnstone, considering him too much of an individual player, to the overall detriment of the team, and he left him out of the team for the 1965 Scottish Cup Final. Johnstone soon won Stein round with his skill, and won his first winner&#x27;s medal on 23 October 1965 when he played in Celtic&#x27;s 2–1 win over Rangers in the Scottish League Cup Final. His 32 league appearances and nine goals that season helped Celtic win their first league title in 12 years. Johnstone also helped Celtic reach their second European semi-final, scoring twice against Go Ahead Eagles en route, before losing 2–1 on aggregate to Liverpool in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

Johnstone was one of the &quot;Lisbon Lions&quot;, the team that won the then European Cup for Celtic in 1967. In an early round tie against Nantes, Johnstone&#x27;s trickery on the wing saw him dubbed &quot;the Flying Flea&quot; by the French press, while his performances over that season saw him finish third in the European Footballer of the Year award.

Two weeks after their European Cup win, Celtic played Real Madrid on 7 June 1967 in a testimonial match for the now retired Alfredo Di Stefano. In front of over 100,000 fans at the Bernabéu Stadium, the sides engaged in a keenly fought contest that saw Bertie Auld and Real Madrid&#x27;s Amancio sent off. Di Stefano played for the first 15 minutes, but it was Jimmy Johnstone who stole the show with an exhilarating performance that had even the Spanish supporters chanting &quot;Olé!&quot; throughout the game. Johnstone capped an outstanding performance by playing the pass to Bobby Lennox for the only goal in a 1–0 win for Celtic.
Johnstone had a morbid fear of flying, which Jock Stein used to great effect on one occasion. Ahead of the first leg of a European tie against Red Star Belgrade at Parkhead in November 1968, Stein told Johnstone that, if Celtic won by four goals, he wouldn&#x27;t have to travel to Yugoslavia for the second leg. Johnstone went on to produce an outstanding performance, scoring twice and providing assists for the other three goals in a 5–1 win. He helped Celtic reach a further European Cup Final in season 1969–70. His performance in the second leg of the semi-final against Leeds United at Hampden Park was particularly outstanding, and his mazy run in the second half set up Bobby Murdoch to score with a powerful shot for Celtic&#x27;s winning goal in a 2–1 victory on the night. Leeds&#x27; defender Terry Cooper later quipped &quot;I would love to have kicked Jinky, but I couldn&#x27;t get near him!&quot; Billy Bremner described Johnstone&#x27;s performance as &quot;one of the greatest exhibitions I have ever seen&quot;, adding that &quot;Jimmy had one of these games where he was unstoppable.&quot; Celtic played Feyenoord in the final but, with Johnstone double-marked at all times, Celtic were unable to perform as they had in the 1967 final. Feyenoord dominated the match and defeated Celtic 2–1 after extra-time.

In all, he made 308 League appearances for Celtic, scoring 82 goals. He also played another 207 times for them in the Scottish Cup, League Cup and in Europe, for an overall total of 515 matches. He received further Ballon d&#x27;Or nominations in 1968 and 1969 placing 24th and 23rd, respectively.

===Later career===
He later played for the San Jose Earthquakes, Sheffield United, Dundee, Shelbourne and Elgin City. His manager at Dundee was former teammate Tommy Gemmell, but Johnstone later stated that his &#x27;heart was not in it&#x27; and he did not apply himself properly during his short spell at Dens Park, having lost the motivation to play for other clubs after being released by Celtic.

==International career==

Johnstone began his international career on 5 February 1964, playing for the Scottish Under 23 side in a friendly against England U23s, losing 2–0. He made one further appearance for the Scotland U23 side in May that year, a 3–0 win away against France U23.

He made his international debut for the full Scottish international side on 3 October 1964 in a British Home Championship match against Wales, in place of Rangers winger Willie Henderson. He was involved in the move that led to Scotland&#x27;s second goal, though the match ended in a 3–2 win for the Welsh. Johnstone&#x27;s next cap came that same month in a World Cup qualifier at Hampden Park against Finland. Scotland won 3–1, but Johnstone&#x27;s performance was unimpressive, with his passing described as &quot;lacking accuracy.&quot; Johnstone did not play for Scotland again until 2 April 1966, when he scored his first two international goals in a 4–3 defeat against England at Hampden Park. The first goal came with Scotland trailing 4–1, when he latched on to a pass from Denis Law and used his pace and power to run past the English defence and beat goalkeeper Gordon Banks from close range. He pulled back another goal for Scotland when he chased a floated ball towards goal from a Jim Baxter free kick and, from close range, scored with a powerful shot off the underside of the bar. Johnstone, along with Denis Law, was reported as one of Scotland&#x27;s best performers, and his play resulted in England&#x27;s Nobby Stiles being booked for a crushing tackle on him. Johnstone continued to play sporadically for Scotland, and he didn&#x27;t score his next international goal until 22 October 1969 in a World Cup qualifier away against West Germany, Scotland losing 3–2.

In May 1974, during the build-up to the 1974 FIFA World Cup, and days before a British Home Championship match against England at Hampden, Johnstone and his other Scotland teammates took part in a drinking session at their hotel in Largs, Ayrshire. In the early hours, the group headed for shore, with Johnstone deciding to go out in a rowing boat. However, the boat had no rowlocks to take the oars and Johnstone found himself being taken out to sea by the tide. Stranded at sea, Johnstone had to be rescued by the Coastguard and the incident dominated headlines for days. Despite the embarrassing headlines, Johnstone went on to turn in an outstanding performance for Scotland against England, helping them to a 2–0 win. Johnstone was part of the Scotland squad that travelled to West Germany for the World Cup in the summer of 1974, but he didn&#x27;t play in their three games.

Johnstone won 23 caps for Scotland.

==Style of play==

Regarded as one of Scotland&#x27;s greatest players, Johnstone was a diminutive winger known for his technique and dribbling skills, being able to go past players with ease, cut inside, score or contribute to goals.

==Later life==
After his playing career ended, Johnstone&#x27;s problems with alcohol worsened, despite the efforts of his family. When he approached Glasgow businessman and Celtic fan Willie Haughey in 1992 offering his medals for sale, Johnstone instead received support and guidance from Haughey in combatting his addictions, and the two men remained close friends thereafter.

A documentary film about Johnstone&#x27;s life, created by Jamie Doran and narrated by Billy Connolly titled &quot;Lord of the Wing&quot; first aired on the BBC on 25 April 2004.

In June 2005, Carl Fabergé&#x27;s great-granddaughter Sarah produced 19 jewelled eggs related to Johnstone.

==Death and legacy==
Having been diagnosed with incurable motor neuron disease (MND) five years earlier, Johnstone died in March 2006, aged 61. The last person to call him was old Rangers rival Willie Henderson, who had become a firm friend of Johnstone. Thousands of Celtic fans and fans of many other clubs, including those of arch-rivals Rangers, paid tribute to his memory outside Celtic Park on St Patrick&#x27;s Day, the day of his funeral service. Tributes were paid to Johnstone before the 2006 Scottish League Cup Final, played between Celtic and Dunfermline. There was a minute of applause before the game and the entire Celtic squad wore the number 7 on their shorts in his honour.

In 2008, a bronze statue by Kate Robinson of Johnstone in action was unveiled at the main entrance to Celtic Park.

In 2011, a statue of Johnstone and a memorial garden were created on the site at his former school, close to his home, on the Old Edinburgh Road, in Viewpark. The garden was opened by Johnstone&#x27;s wife, family and some of the surviving members of the &#x27;Lisbon Lions&#x27; team. The bronze, lifesize statue was made by sculptor John McKenna.

FIFA 100 All-time Dutch great Rob Rensenbrink recalled Johnstone first among world-class Scottish footballers.

<text>Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park () is a national park in Scotland centred on Loch Lomond and the hills and glens of the Trossachs, along with several other ranges of hills. It was the first of the two national parks established by the Scottish Parliament in 2002, the second being the Cairngorms National Park. The park extends to cover much of the western part of the southern highlands, lying to the north of the Glasgow conurbation, and contains many mountains and lochs. It is the fourth-largest national park in the British Isles, with a total area of and a boundary of some in length. It features 21 Munros (including Ben Lomond, Ben Lui, Beinn Challuim, Ben More and two peaks called Ben Vorlich) and 20 Corbetts.

The park straddles the Highland Boundary Fault, which divides it into two distinct regions - lowland and highland - that differ in underlying geology, soil types and topography. The change in rock type can most clearly be seen at Loch Lomond itself, as the fault runs across the islands of Inchmurrin, Creinch, Torrinch and Inchcailloch and over the ridge of Conic Hill. To the south lie green fields and cultivated land; to the north, mountains.

The Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park lies close to Scotland&#x27;s heavily populated Central Belt, and the area has long been popular with visitors. Principal attractions are viewing scenery and wildlife, walking, climbing, water sports, and other outdoor activities. In 2017, there were 2.9 million visits to the park, of which 2.1 million were day visits and 783,000 were made by visitors staying overnight within the park.

==Geography==

The national park extends to cover much of the western part of the southern highlands, lying to the north of the Glasgow conurbation. The park authority defines the park as being split into four sections: Breadalbane, Loch Lomond, The Trossachs, and Cowal.

The park is centred on Loch Lomond, the largest lake in Great Britain by surface area, with a surface area of . The loch contains many islands, including Inchmurrin, the largest fresh-water island in the British Isles. It is a popular leisure destination, and is surrounded by hills, including Ben Lomond on the eastern shore, which is in height, and the most southerly of the Scottish Munro peaks. A 2005 poll of &quot;Radio Times&quot; readers voted Loch Lomond as the sixth greatest natural wonder in Britain.

The Trossachs are an area of wooded hills, glens and lochs that lie to the east of Loch Lomond. The name was originally applied only to a small woodland glen that lies at the centre of the area, but is now generally applied to the wider region. They have long been visited by tourists due to the relative proximity of major population centres such as Glasgow and Stirling, and the area remains popular with walkers, cyclists and tourists. The wooded hills and lochs of the area may be considered to represent a microcosm of a typical highland landscape, and the woodlands are an important habitat for many species.

Much of the Trossachs area is protected by various different conservation designations, including the &quot;Great Trossachs Forest&quot; national nature reserve.

Breadalbane refers to the northern part of the park, including the villages of Crianlarich and Tyndrum. The area consists of the steep hills and mountains of the southern highlands, and includes Ben More, the highest mountain in the national park. Breadalbane formed one of the traditional provinces of Scotland, and traditionally comprised the watershed of Loch Tay (i.e. Glen Dochart, Glen Lochay, and the banks of Loch Tay itself), thus extending well beyond the boundaries of the national park.

The westernmost part of the park comprises the eastern side of the Cowal peninsula, which is separated from the rest of the park by Loch Long. Much of the peninsula is covered by the Argyll Forest Park, which is managed by Forestry and Land Scotland. The Arrochar Alps, a popular location for hillwalking and climbing, lie at the northern edge of Cowal, overlooking Loch Lomond.

Several major transport routes pass through the park, including the A82 road between Glasgow and Fort William, which follows the western shore of Loch Lomond, continuing north via Strath Fillan to bypass the village of Crianlarich and pass through Tyndrum. The A85 road from Edinburgh passes to the east of the Trossachs and through the Breadalbane area of the park, meeting the A82 at Crianlarich. The only railway in the national park is the West Highland Line, which follows the eastern shore of Loch Long as far as Arrochar, and thence runs close to the A82 as far as Tyndrum.

==Formation of the national park==
Many countries have established national parks on the basis of setting aside areas of wilderness; Scotland however, lacks any such areas, as thousands of years of human activity have altered the landscape. Human settlement and activity, including agriculture, historical deforestation, overgrazing by sheep and deer, and extensive 20th century afforestation with introduced tree species (particularly conifers) have resulted in landscapes which are best described as semi-natural.

Despite the lack of true &quot;wilderness&quot; the idea that areas of Scotland having wild or remote character should be designated to protect the environment and encourage public access grew in popularity throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Following the Second World War, a committee was established to consider the issue of national parks in Scotland. The report, published in 1945, proposed national parks in five areas, one of which was Loch Lomond and The Trossachs. The government designated these five areas as &quot;National Park Direction Areas&quot;, giving powers for planning decisions taken by local authorities to be reviewed by central government, however the areas were not given full national park status. In 1981 the direction areas were replaced by national scenic areas, of which there are now 40. In 1990 the Countryside Commission for Scotland (CCS) produced a report into protection of the landscape of Scotland, which recommended that four areas were under such pressure that they ought to be designated as national parks, each with an independent planning board, in order to retain their heritage value. The four areas identified were similar to those proposed in 1945, and thus again included Loch Lomond and The Trossachs.

Despite this long history of recommendations that national parks be established in Scotland, no action was taken until the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999. The Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park was designated as such under the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, which was one of the first pieces of legislation to be passed by the Parliament. The park was formally established on 1 July 2002.

==Wildlife and conservation==

Over 200 species of birds and over 25% of all the species of plants known to occur in Britain have been recorded in the national park. The park is home to many of the species most associated with the Scottish highlands, including capercaillie, red deer, red squirrel, Scottish wildcat, golden eagle, peregrine falcon, black grouse, buzzard and osprey. Beavers are also now present in the park, with signs of beaver activity being observed on Loch Achray in the Trossachs during a survey undertaken over the winter of 2017–18; the beavers are assumed to have spread there from the existing population on the River Tay. A colony of wallabies has lived on Inchconnachan, an island in Loch Lomond, since 1940.

Many different habitats are present in the park, including large areas of woodland, which covers approximately 30% of the park. Around 22.5% is covered commercial conifer plantations, whilst native woodlands cover 7.5%. Native woodland in the park includes area of Atlantic oakwoods, Caledonian pinewoods, and areas of wet woodland. Higher up there are important upland habitats such as heathland, blanket bog and willow scrub. The park has 22 large lochs and 50 rivers and larger burns, along with numerous smaller lochs, lochans and burns. These waters support fish species such as salmon, trout, Arctic charr, powan and river, brook and sea lampreys.

The park also includes of coastline around three sea lochs: Loch Long, Loch Goil and the Holy Loch. This coastline consists of many rocky shores, cliffs, and areas of salt marsh and mudflats. The coastal habitat is rich in marine invertebrates, and supports a range of waders and seabirds. Marine wildlife such as harbour seals and porpoises can be found further offshore.

===Conservation designations===
The national park is classified as a Category v protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. 
In total 67 sites within the park hold some form of conservation designation for their natural heritage value, including 8 Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) and 2 Special Protection Areas (SPA). Two of Scotland&#x27;s national scenic areas - Loch Lomond NSA and the Trossachs NSA - are wholly within the national park, and the westernmost part of the River Earn (Comrie to St Fillans) NSA also lies within the park&#x27;s boundaries. Additionally, there are two forest parks (Queen Elizabeth Forest Park and Argyll Forest Park) and two national nature reserves (NNR) (Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve and The Great Trossachs Forest National Nature Reserve) within the National Park. The Loch Lomond NNR is managed by a partnership of the National Park Authority, RSPB Scotland and NatureScot, whilst The Great Trossachs Forest is managed by a partnership of Forestry and Land Scotland, RSPB Scotland and Woodland Trust Scotland.

==Recreation and tourism==

The area has long been popular with tourists, with the Trossachs being one of the first parts of Scotland to become a recognised tourist destination due to its position on the southern edge of the Highlands and to the quality of the scenery, which may be considered to represent a microcosm of a typical Highland landscape. Loch Lomond was also a popular destination for early travellers, such that when James Boswell and Samuel Johnson visited on the return from their tour of the Western Isles in 1773, the area was already firmly enough established as a destination for Boswell to note that it would be unnecessary to attempt any description.

In 2017 there were 2.9 million visits to the park, of which 2.1 million were day visits and 783,000 were made by visitors staying overnight within the park. Beauty spots include the Falls of Dochart, the viewpoint at the Rest and be thankful, and Inchcailloch island in Loch Lomond. There is a national park visitor centre in Balloch at the southern end of Loch Lomond, called Loch Lomond Shores, which includes a visitor information centre at the most popular gateway to the park, as well as an aquarium, shops and restaurants.

Loch Lomond is one of Scotland&#x27;s premier boating and watersports venues, with visitors enjoying activities including kayaking, Canadian canoeing, paddle boarding, wake boarding, water skiing and wake surfing. The national park authority has tried to achieve a balance between land-based tourists and loch users, with environmentally sensitive areas subject to a strictly enforced speed limit, but the rest of the loch open to speeds of up to . Cruises on the loch can be taken from Tarbet, Inversnaid, Luss and Rowardennan, and on Loch Katrine in the Trossachs visitors can travel on the historic steamship SS Sir Walter Scott (launched in 1899).

The park is popular with walkers, with routes ranging from easy family strolls through to hillwalking on the park&#x27;s highest summits. Popular summits include Ben Lomond in Dunbartonshire and The Cobbler in the Arrochar Alps. The West Highland Way, Scotland&#x27;s first officially designated long-distance footpath, passes through the park, following the eastern shore of Loch Lomond and passing close to Crianlarich. In addition to the West Highland Way five more of Scotland&#x27;s Great Trails pass through sections of the park, including the Loch Lomond and Cowal Way, the Three Lochs Way and the Great Trossachs Path.

As with all land and inland water in Scotland there is a right of responsible access to the land, lochs and rivers of the park for those wishing to participate in recreational pursuits such as walking, camping, swimming and canoeing. In 2017 the national park authority introduced byelaws restricting the right to camp along much of the shoreline of Loch Lomond, due to issues such as litter and anti-social behaviour that were blamed on some irresponsible campers. The byelaws were opposed by groups such as Mountaineering Scotland and Ramblers Scotland, who argued that they would criminalise camping even where it was carried out responsibly, and that the national park authority already had sufficient powers to address irresponsible behaviour using existing laws. The restrictions have since been extended to cover a number of other parts of the park, including land around most of the major lochs. In these areas camping is now restricted to designated sites, and campers are required to purchase a permit to camp within these areas between March and October.

==Administration==

The national park is administered by a national park authority, which is an executive non-departmental public body of the Scottish Government. Under the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, national parks in Scotland have four aims:

#To conserve and enhance the natural and cultural heritage of the area
#To promote sustainable use of the natural resources of the area
#To promote understanding and enjoyment (including enjoyment in the form of recreation) of the special qualities of the area by the public
#To promote sustainable economic and social development of the area&#x27;s communities

The aims are slightly broader than the duties and purposes set out for English and Welsh national parks under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and amending legislation. The general purpose of the national park authority, as defined in the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, is to ensure that these aims are &quot;collectively achieved ...in a coordinated way&quot;. Although the four aims have equal status, in accordance with the Sandford Principle, the first aim (conservation and enhancement of the natural and cultural heritage) is to be given greater weight when it appears to the park authority that there is irreconcilable conflict with the other aims.

The Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park Authority is a full planning authority, exercising powers that would otherwise be exercised by local authorities, and also takes responsibility for managing access to the countryside that elsewhere falls to local authorities. Aside from the planning and access function, the national parks authority has considerable flexibility as to how the four aims are achieved. It can, for example, acquire land, make byelaws and management agreements, provide grants, offer advice, and undertake or commission research. The authority is headquartered in Balloch, at the southern end of Loch Lomond.

The national park authority is run by a board, consisting of 17 members. Five members are elected by the community and twelve are appointed by the Scottish Government, of whom six are nominated by the Local Authorities. The board meets in public at least three times a year.

<doc id="624989" wikidata="Q9372343" url="?curid=624989" title="Whitewater Region">
<text>Whitewater Region is a township on the Ottawa River in Renfrew County, located within the Ottawa Valley in eastern Ontario, Canada. Whitewater Region is made up of the former municipalities of Beachburg, Cobden, Ross and Westmeath, which were amalgamated into the current township on January 1, 2001.

Whitewater Region is named after the stretch of whitewater on the Ottawa River, popular for rafting and kayaking. This section is part of the Ottawa River Provincial Park.

The township also claims a distinctive place in Canada&#x27;s history. An astrolabe bearing the date 1613 and believed to have belonged to Samuel de Champlain was discovered within the township. A monument commemorating this historic site is located just outside Cobden along Highway 17.

==Communities==
The township comprises the communities of: Beachburg, Chenaux, Cobden, Finchley, Foresters Falls, Garden of Eden, The Glen, Grants Settlement, Haley Station, Kerr Line, La Passe, Ledgerwoods Corner, McLaren&#x27;s Settlement, Meath, Millars Corner, Perretton, Pleasant Valley, Queens Line, Rocher Fendu, Shields Crossing, Snake River and Westmeath.

===Beachburg===
Beachburg () is one of the larger population centres in the Whitewater Region, having a variety of stores and restaurants, an arena, several halls, a public elementary school and a public library. It was founded by and named after David Beach and became a stop along the Canadian Northern Railway line with a station and grain elevators. In 1853, the entire village, except for two houses, was destroyed by fire. By 1869, Beachburg was a village with a population of 250 in Westmeath County, Renfrew. There were stages to Pembroke and Sand Point. The average price for land was $8.

Beachburg was devastated by a fire in 1931, destroying the station, the grain elevators, and the Main Hall and Dining Hall of the Exhibition Park. In 1959, the Village of Beachburg was separated from Westmeath Township and incorporated.

===Cobden===
===Foresters Falls===
Foresters Falls () was founded in the early 1840s by Oliver Forester, a prominent pioneer who was the community&#x27;s first postmaster. By the 1870s the community had three stores, a grist mill, and a sawmill, all of which were destroyed in a fire later that same year. The Canadian Northern Railway does not pass through Foresters Falls, save for at a small intersection outside the town known as Miller&#x27;s Corners. A large railway bridge, known to the locals as Black Rock, crosses a gully just beyond Miller&#x27;s Corners. The rail track was torn up in the late 2000s but the bridge remains and is now a popular route for ATVs. Foresters Falls is now a small community having regressed since the invention of motorized transport. Attractions include the Ross Township Museum that is located in the heart of Foresters Falls.

===Haley Station===
Haley Station (also known as &quot;Haley&quot;, &quot;Haleys&quot;, &quot;Haley&#x27;s&quot;, with or without Station)() derives its name from a station built on the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) where the railway right of way crossed the farm of George Haley, an early settler on the second concession of Ross township (now part of Whitewater township). Haley Station once boasted a blacksmith shop, a general store, two churches (United Church and Free Methodist), two service stations, a railway station and an Orange Hall. With the advent of the automobile, people found it more convenient to go to Renfrew. Of the establishments mentioned, only the United Church remains in operation.

===McLaren&#x27;s Settlement===
McLaren&#x27;s Settlement () originated in the 1840s when members of the McLaren family came to the area from Scotland. It was located a short distance upstream from the present Ontario Power Generation (OPG) Chenaux Generating Station. The McLarens arrived during the peak of the lumbering industry in the Ottawa Valley, and one of their number constructed a timber slide in the Ottawa River to facilitate the movement of squared timber rafts past the Chenaux Rapids. These slides could be described as a sluice about wide and about long and steeply sloped through which some river water was diverted. Floating bundles of about 25 pieces of squared timber would be steered toward the upper end of the slide. Once into the sluice, the bundle of timber would descend at a great speed, emerging undamaged into the river below the rapids.

==History==

===Founding and development===
Much of the early development in Renfrew County is largely a circumstance of location. As Pembroke and Ottawa grew, so did the gap between them. In the 19th century, the easiest route between the two was the Ottawa River. However, the presence of rapids near Portage-du-Fort necessitated a land route. At this time the area was mostly a vast forest untouched by Europeans. A few settlers had put down near Muskrat Lake, but for the most part there had been little European settler activity since Champlain&#x27;s visit in the 17th century.

In 1849 Jason Gould built a road from what came to be called Goulds Landing to what would become Cobden on Muskrat Lake. One could catch a steamer down the lake and then go on by road to Pembroke. The traffic on the road could not help but cause growth. In 1850 Gould built a post office and named the fledgling settlement Cobden after Richard Cobden, a member of the British Parliament whom Gould admired. By October 2, 1876, the railway had reached Cobden. The community started to expand from the lake towards the railway station further inland. Main Street began to take shape: the &quot;Cobden Sun&quot;, the Bank of Ottawa, blacksmith shops, a bakery, a general store, a mill, a surgeon and a jewelry store were all located in the community.

In 1880 a public school was opened to accommodate the strain on nearby S.S. No 1. Cobden was soon the biggest community in Ross Township and became an incorporated village in October 1901.

Cobden has been the victim of many fires, which have destroyed almost all the original buildings. Main Street has suffered worst from fire, including one in 1913 which destroyed the &quot;Cobden Sun&quot; building and many historical records.

A hydro-electric dam began operating at the falls south of Cobden. It supplied the town, off and on, with power until it was destroyed on April 12, 1934 in a raging flood. Large blocks of ice ripped the dam apart and poured over Highway 17, tearing away sections of pavement. The plant operator, Bill Wall, was stranded in the upper section of his house until flooding subsided. The town then started receiving power from a station in Calabogie.

Council elections in 1949 were dominated by the issue of whether to hold another plebiscite on establishing a waterworks system. A previous plebiscite had come out 82–56 against. But times were changing quickly—after the war a new council was elected and the next vote was 124–46 in favour and by the early 1950s Cobden had water. The waterworks system required constant maintenance until a major retooling in the 1980s. The visibly dominating water tower was built in 1988 replacing the original (built in 1951).

A bigger school was needed by 1903. The present-day school, Cobden District Public, was built in 1938 and served initially as a high school until Opeongo High School was built.

===The Astrolabe===
In 1613, French explorer Samuel de Champlain, traveled through an area very near Cobden while exploring the Ottawa River. Due to the Chenaux Rapids, Champlain and his men were forced to portage. They presumably took shore in Browns Bay near present-day McKenzie&#x27;s Hill. In 1953 a large rock was found in this area bearing a chiseled inscription. Though the inscription was hard to read it was determined that it said &quot;Champlain Juin 2, 1613&quot;. Champlain&#x27;s trail from this point is debatable. He may have cut straight across land to the southern tip of Jeffreys Lake, or he may have veered south skirting the far side of what later came to be known as the Champlain Trail Lakes. It is known that he eventually made his way to Green Lake and at this point, according to several 17th-century authors, Champlain lost his astrolabe. It remained there for 254 years, until it was found in 1867 by Edward George Lee, a 14-year-old farm boy helping his father clear trees near Green Lake (now Astrolabe Lake). Lee gave the astrolabe to Captain Comley, a steamboat captain on Muskrat Lake but never received the ten dollars Cowley promised him. Cowley sold the astrolabe to his employer, R.W. Cassels of the Ottawa Forwarding Company. The astrolabe eventually passed to Samuel V. Hoffman of the New York Historical Society in 1942, remaining there for 47 years until it was acquired by the Canadian Museum of Civilization in 1989.

In 1990 a special celebration was held in Cobden in honour of the astrolabe&#x27;s return.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Whitewater Region had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Economy==
The Dominion Magnesium Limited (DML) smelter was the first industrial site of the Pidgeon process. Haley Industries was founded in 1952 to benefit from it.

Timminco Limited operated the DML magnesium smelter in Haley Station as recently as the year 2000, but by the year 2011 it had been shuttered.

==Culture==
The Cobden Farmers&#x27; Market, first organized in 1991, is an outdoor market that runs from May to October. It offers a variety of crafts and foodstuffs; everything must be grown or handmade locally. The market has recently moved from the Memorial Hall grounds to the Fair Grounds, but the Christmas Market, the grande finale for the year, is held in the Ag Hall, also on the Fair Grounds.

Overlooking Muskrat Lake, Cobden Park occupies what is thought to be the spot where Champlain met the Native Chief Nibachis. A plaque was erected in the 1960s commemorating this event. The lands for the park were donated by Thomas Robinson and his wife in 1904. In 1988 extensive work was carried out on the beach portion of the park by the Civitans.
Logos Land is a religious-based water park. Built on the site of the Astrolabe&#x27;s discovery, Logos Land features five water slides, paddle boats, mini-golf and a representation of Noah&#x27;s Ark which holds a souvenir shop and &quot;The Ark&quot; restaurant. It is also home to Canada&#x27;s tallest Christmas tree standing high. Every year over 3000 local children get together to decorate the tree, which is dedicated to children around the world.

Mussie is a likely mythical Nessie-like creature said to reside in Muskrat Lake.

Ottawa Valley Pentecostal Camp (OVPC) is a Christian-based family and children&#x27;s camp at the foot of Muskrat Lake. It has hosted many local community events with its year round facilities. OVPC is owned and operated by the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada.

Storyland once featured 200 animated characters set in 40 different fairy tale scenes surrounded by a natural woodland environment. The park is now a campground for glamping. The Champlain Lookout offers a panoramic view of the Ottawa River.

==Transportation==

The only provincial highway serving the township directly is Highway 17, the main route of the Trans-Canada Highway through Ontario. The planned extension of Highway 417 to Petawawa will see the highway largely rerouted onto a new alignment through Whitewater Region.

Home to The Champlain Flying Club, the Cobden/Bruce McPhail Memorial Airport is located on Highway 17.

==Municipal council==
The municipal council sits in Cobden. It consists of Mayor Neil Nicholson, Deputy Mayor Cathy Regier, and Councillors Chris Olmstead, Mark Bell, Connie Tabbert, Joey Trimm, and Michael Moore.

==Notable people==
Cobden is the hometown of Susie Laska, former professional hockey player for the NWHL and Robert Wellington Mayhew, the first Canadian ambassador to Japan.

Westmeath is the birthplace of D. Allan Bromley, physicist, academic, and Science Adviser to former President of the United States, George H. W. Bush.

<text>Crickhowell (; , non-standard spelling &quot;&quot;) is a town and community in southeastern Powys, Wales, near Abergavenny, and is in the historic county of Brecknockshire.

==Location==

The town lies on the River Usk, on the southern edge of the Black Mountains and in the eastern part of the Brecon Beacons National Park. Significant parts of the surrounding countryside, over , form part of the Glanusk Park estate.

==Etymology and language==
The name Crickhowell is an anglicised spelling that corresponds to the Welsh Crucywel. The name is derived from Crug Hywel, meaning &#x27;Hywel&#x27;s mound&#x27;. This is usually identified with the Iron Age hill fort on nearby Table Mountain, although this has the local name of Mynydd y Begwn. It may be that Crug Hywel refers to the castle mound in the town itself. The language of Crickhowell (and Llangynidr) was originally Welsh. In his 1893 book &quot;Wales and her language&quot;, John E. Southall, reports that over 60% of the population of Crickhowell spoke Welsh, although the town was only a few miles from more anglicised Abergavenny.

==The town==

There is a primary school and a secondary school; both act as a central point for a large catchment area. There is some light industry on the outskirts of Crickhowell at the Elvicta Industrial Estate. The town centre includes a variety of traditional businesses, many of which are family owned. Other facilities in Crickhowell include a library, two play areas, public toilets and the CRiC building, which houses a tourist information centre, an internet cafe, an art gallery and a local history archive. There are pubs, cafes, restaurants and two hotels: &quot;The Bear&quot; and &quot;The Dragon&quot;.

The churches in Crickhowell include St Edmund&#x27;s Church which holds a service every Sunday, Crickhowell Evangelical Church, a Baptist church and a Catholic church.

In 2015, Crickhowell appeared in a TV documentary, claiming it as the first British settlement to purposely use similar tax avoidance tactics used by multinational businesses to avoid paying taxes themselves, in protest at the way large corporations use legal loopholes to avoid paying UK corporation tax.

A market and fair have been recorded since 1281.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Crickhowell, at community (town) and county level: Crickhowell Town Council and Powys County Council. Planning matters fall to the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority. The town council meets at the Crickhowell Resource and Information Centre on Beaufort Street and has its offices in the adjoining Clarence House (part of the Clarence Hall complex).

===Administrative history===
Crickhowell was an ancient parish in the Crickhowell (or Crucywel) hundred of Brecknockshire. The manor which covered the town was called the &#x27;borough of Crickhowell&#x27;, but it was never given a charter and it appears that no borough council ever operated. Any residual claim Crickhowell may have had to be called a borough was extinguished under the Municipal Corporations Act 1883.

When elected parish and district councils were introduced in 1894, Crickhowell was given a parish council and included in the Crickhowell Rural District. The rural district was abolished in 1974, after which Crickhowell was included in the Borough of Brecknock in the new county of Powys; the borough in turn was abolished in 1996 and its functions passed to Powys County Council. The parish of Crickhowell was redesignated as a community in 1974; its community council took the name Crickhowell Town Council.

==Tourism==
Today, Crickhowell is a popular tourist destination. In 2005 a tourist information centre was built in the centre of town and during summer the town is notably busier. Many people visit Crickhowell to see the Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons, and perhaps to enjoy some mountain-biking, camping, hillwalking, rock climbing, fly-fishing, hang-gliding or caravanning, or simply to tour the area by car, staying in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. The Green Man Festival takes place annually in mid-August at nearby Glanusk Park.

==Notable buildings==

Notable features in Crickhowell include the seventeenth-century stone bridge over the River Usk with its odd arches (twelve on one side, thirteen on the other) and its seat built into the walls, the 14th-century parish church of St Edmund, and the ruins of Crickhowell Castle on the green &quot;tump&quot; set back from the A40 Brecon to Abergavenny road.

===Market Hall===
Crickhowell Market Hall (originally the Town Hall) on The Square dates from 1834, nowadays with market stalls on the ground floor and a cafe in the first floor old courtroom. In 2007 Powys County Council handed over responsibility of the hall to a charity, the Market Hall Trust. The stone building, raised on twin doric columns, is Grade II* listed.

<doc id="624993" wikidata="Q1025953" url="?curid=624993" title="Cairngorms National Park">
<text>Cairngorms National Park () is a national park in northeast Scotland, established in 2003. It was the second of two national parks established by the Scottish Parliament, after Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, which was set up in 2002. The park covers the Cairngorms range of mountains, and surrounding hills. Already the largest national park in the United Kingdom, in 2010 it was expanded into Perth and Kinross. 

Roughly 18,000 people live within the national park. The largest communities are Aviemore, Ballater, Braemar, Grantown-on-Spey, Kingussie, Newtonmore and Tomintoul. Like all other national parks in the UK, the park is IUCN designated Category V however it contains within its boundaries several national nature reserves that have IUCN Category II (national park) statuses, such as Abernethy Forest and Mar Lodge Estate. 

In 2018, 1.9 million tourism visits were recorded. The majority of visitors are domestic, with 25 per cent coming from elsewhere in the UK, and 21 per cent being from other countries. 
Tourism makes up about 80% of the economy of the national park.

==Geography==

The Cairngorms National Park covers an area of in the council areas of Aberdeenshire, Moray, Highland, Angus and Perth and Kinross. The mountain range of the Cairngorms lies at the heart of the national park, but forms only one part of it, alongside other hill ranges such as the Angus Glens and the Monadhliath, and lower areas like Strathspey and upper Deeside. Three major rivers rise in the park: the Spey, the Dee, and the Don. The Spey, which is the second longest river in Scotland, rises in the Monadhliath, whilst the Dee and the Don both rise in the Cairngorms themselves.

The Cairngorms themselves are a spectacular landscape, similar in appearance to the Hardangervidda National Park of Norway in having a large area of upland plateau. The range consists of three main plateaux at about 1000–1200 m above sea level, above which domed summits (the eroded stumps of once much higher mountains) rise to around 1300 m. Many of the summits have tors, free-standing rock outcrops that stand on top of the boulder-strewn landscape. The edges of the plateaux are in places steep cliffs of granite and they are excellent for skiing, rock climbing and ice climbing.
The Cairngorms form an arctic-alpine mountain environment, with tundra-like characteristics and long-lasting snow patches.

The Monadhliath mountains lie to the north of Strathspey, and comprise a bleak, wide plateau rising to between 700 and 950 m.

Two major transport routes run through the park, with both the A9 road and the Highland Main Line crossing over the Pass of Drumochter and running along Strathspey, providing links between the western and northern parts of the park and the cities of Perth and Inverness. The Highland Main Line is the only mainline rail route through the park, however there are several other major roads, including the A86, which links Strathspey to Fort William, and the A93, which links the Deeside area of the park to both Perth and Aberdeen.

==Geology==

The majority of the rocks within the Cairngorms National Park belong to the Dalradian Supergroup, a thick sequence of sands, muds and limestones that were deposited between about 800 and 600 million years ago on the margins of the former continent of Laurentia. Rocks now ascribed to the Moine Supergroup occur along the northwestern edge of the Park. These Dalradian and Moine successions were intensely faulted, folded and metamorphosed during the Caledonian Orogeny between about 490 and 430 million years ago. Geologists recognize a &#x27;Grampian event&#x27;, centred around 470 million years ago, which was responsible for the initial deformation of the Dalradian and relates to the collision of a volcanic island arc with Laurentia over a period of about 20 million years. The subsequent collision of Baltica with Laurentia caused the &#x27;Scandian event&#x27; which involved further folding and faulting of the Dalradian rock sequence. The Great Glen, Ericht-Laidon and Glen Tilt faults were all active as strike-slip faults at this time and may have played a part in allowing large plutons of granite to rise up amongst the Dalradian rocks and then cool in situ.

The largest of these plutons is the granite mass which forms the Cairngorms themselves and which was emplaced around 427 million years ago. It is thought that the pluton had been unroofed within 20 million years of its emplacement and that the present landscape of the Cairngorms had begun to form by 390 million years ago. Evidence suggests that the granite currently at the surface was initially to be found at a depth of between 4 and 7 km.

Other than a small outlier of Old Red Sandstone, there are no younger solid rocks within the national park. The ice ages of the last 2.5 million years have however left their mark both in terms of erosional and depositional features. Post-glacial features include peat and landslips.

==Nature and conservation==

The Cairngorm mountains provide a unique alpine semi-tundra moorland habitat, home to many rare plants, birds and animals. Speciality bird species on the plateaux include breeding ptarmigan, dotterel, snow bunting, golden eagle, ring ouzel, and red grouse. Mammal species include red deer and mountain hare, as well as the only herd of semi-domesticated reindeer in the British Isles. They now roam the high Cairngorms, after being brought in 1952 by a Swedish herdsman. The herd is now stable at around 150 individuals, some born in Scotland and some introduced from Sweden.

The straths and glens of the national park feature a type of ancient woodland known as the Caledonian forest. The expanse of pinewood that stretches from Glen Feshie to Abernethy forms the largest single area of this habitat remaining in Scotland, and the park as a whole holds more than half the surviving Caledonian forest. In these forests can be found bird species such capercaillie, black grouse, Scottish crossbill, parrot crossbill and crested tit.

The entire length of the River Dee is defined as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) due to its importance for salmon, otters and freshwater pearl mussels, and the Don supports fish such as salmon, sea trout, brown trout, eels and lamprey. In upper Strathspey, the Insh Marshes form one of the largest areas of floodplain mire and fen vegetation in Scotland, and are important for many species of birds that breed there each summer. Breeding species include osprey, ducks such as wigeon, shoveler and goldeneye, and waders including redshank, snipe, curlew and lapwing. The marshes also receive winter visitors including greylag geese from Iceland and up to 200 whooper swans.

The national park is classified as a Category V protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, meaning that it is an area in which people have interacted with the landscape for many years, and which is managed to sustain the habitats and landscape that have resulted from this interaction. The IUCN defines &quot;National Parks&quot; as areas conforming with Category II of its classification system (q.v. the Hardangervidda National Park), however Scotland in general lacks such areas, as thousands of years of human activity, including agriculture, historical deforestation, overgrazing by sheep and deer, and extensive 20th century afforestation with introduced tree species (particularly conifers), have resulted in landscapes which are best described as semi-natural.

Within the national park there are many areas that have additional protection via other conservation designations: there are 19 Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas and 46 Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Nine of Scotland&#x27;s national nature reserves are located within the park: Abernethy, Corrie Fee, Craigellachie, Glen Tanar, Insh Marshes, Muir of Dinnet, Invereshie and Inshriach, Glenmore, and Mar Lodge Estate.

==History of the national park==

The idea that parts of Scotland of wild or remote character should be designated to protect the environment and encourage public access grew in popularity throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1931 a commission headed by Christopher Addison proposed the creation of a national park in the Cairngorms, alongside proposals for parks in England and Wales. Following the Second World War ten national parks were established in England and Wales, and a committee was established to consider the issue of national parks in Scotland. The report, published in 1945, proposed national parks in five areas, one of which was the Cairngorms. The government designated these five areas as &quot;National Park Direction Areas&quot;, giving powers for planning decisions taken by local authorities to be reviewed by central government, however the areas were not given full national park status. In 1981 the direction areas were replaced by national scenic areas, of which there are now 40. In 1990 the Countryside Commission for Scotland (CCS) produced a report into protection of the landscape of Scotland, which recommended that four areas were under such pressure that they ought to be designated as national parks, each with an independent planning board, in order to retain their heritage value. The four areas identified were similar to those proposed in 1945, and thus again included the Cairngorms.

Despite this long history of recommendations that national parks be established in Scotland, no action was taken until the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999. The two current parks were designated as such under the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, which was one of the first pieces of legislation to be passed by the Parliament. Before the national park was established in 2003, Scottish Natural Heritage conducted a consultation exercise, considering the boundary and the powers and structure of the new park authority.

Following the establishment of the park many groups and local communities felt that a large area of highland Perth and Kinross should form part of the park and carried out a sustained campaign. On 13 March 2008 Michael Russell announced that the national park would be extended to take in Blair Atholl and Spittal of Glenshee, and the park was duly extended on 4 October 2010.

In 2015, of the 132 kV power line in the middle of the park was taken down, while another section along the edge of the park was upgraded to 400 kV.

==Sights and attractions==
Tourism accounts for much of the economy and 43% of employment within the park area. In 2018, 1.9 million tourism visits were recorded. The park&#x27;s mandate is sustainable tourism &quot;that builds on, conserves and enhances [its] special qualities&quot;. The Cairngorms Business Partnership includes 350 private sector member businesses. In early 2017, the park was voted by Hundredrooms as one of the top seven eco-tourism destinations in Europe and discussed as a &quot;mecca for outdoor enthusiasts&quot;. The Visit Scotland web site discusses the amenities and indicates that this park &quot;has more mountains, forest paths, rivers, lochs, wildlife hotspots, friendly villages and distilleries than you can possibly imagine&quot;.
The village of Carrbridge is within the park. In 1717 the Carrbridge Packhorse Bridge was built to cross the River Dulnain so funeral processions could cross to the Duthil Church. It is a stone bridge and it has become a popular tourist attraction.
The park is popular for activities such as walking, cycling, mountain biking, climbing and canoeing: for hillwalkers there are 55 Munros (mountains above in height) in the park. Two of Scotland&#x27;s Great Trails pass through the park: the Speyside Way and the Cateran Trail.

A skiing and winter sports industry is concentrated in the Cairngoms, with three of Scotland&#x27;s five resorts situated here. They are the Cairn Gorm Ski Centre, Glenshee Ski Centre and The Lecht Ski Centre. There was controversy surrounding the construction of the Cairngorm Mountain Railway at the Cairn Gorm Ski Centre, a scheme supported by the national park authority. Supporters of the scheme claimed that it would bring in valuable tourist income, whilst opponents argued that such a development was unsuitable for a protected area. To reduce erosion, the railway operates a &quot;closed scheme&quot; and only allows skiers (in season) out of the upper Ptarmigan station: other visitors may not access the mountain from the railway unless on a guided walk.

The Cairngorm Mountain Railway funicular was closed in October 2018 &quot;due to health and safety concerns&quot;, or &quot;structural problems&quot; according to reports in summer 2019. At the time, an investigation was still underway to determine whether modifications would be &quot;achievable and affordable&quot;. (The same situation was reported in December 2019.) This railway first opened in 2001 and connects the base station with a restaurant on Cairn Gorm mountain.

Aviemore is a busy and popular holiday destination, located close to Glenmore Forest Park and the Cairn Gorm Ski Centre. The Strathspey Railway is preserved railway running steam and heritage diesel services between Aviemore railway station and Broomhill via Boat of Garten, along part of the former Highland Railway.

The Highland Wildlife Park also lies within the national park, and the Frank Bruce Sculpture Trail is located near Feshiebridge. This short trail through the woods features a sculptures created by Frank Bruce between 1965 and 2009.

In addition to the Cairngorm Brewery, six distilleries are located within the Park area: Dalwhinnie distillery, The Glenlivet distillery, Tomintoul distillery, Royal Lochnagar distillery, Balmenach distillery and The Speyside distillery. Royal Lochnagar, Dalwhinnie, Cairngorm Brewery and Glenlivet are set up to receive visitors on a regular basis. Tomintoul, Balmenach and Speyside can be visited but require an appointment made in advance.

==Administration==

The National Park is administered by a national park authority, which is an executive non-departmental public body of the Scottish Government. Under the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, national parks in Scotland have four aims:

#To conserve and enhance the natural and cultural heritage of the area
#To promote sustainable use of the natural resources of the area
#To promote understanding and enjoyment (including enjoyment in the form of recreation) of the special qualities of the area by the public
#To promote sustainable economic and social development of the area&#x27;s communities

The first two of this aims are identical to those included in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 legislation that governs national parks in England and Wales, however the Scottish national parks have two additional aims (3 and 4 above). The general purpose of the National Park Authority, as defined in the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, is to ensure that these aims are &quot;collectively achieved ...in a coordinated way&quot;. Although the four aims have equal status, in accordance with the Sandford Principle, the first aim (conservation and enhancement of the natural and cultural heritage) is to be given greater weight when it appears to the park authority that there is irreconcilable conflict with the other aims.

The National Park Authority works with partners, defined as &quot;business, land owners, communities and charities&quot;. The Cairngorms National Park Partnership Plan 2017 - 2022 includes three long-term goals: conservation, visitor experience and rural development.

The Cairngorms National Park Authority shares statutory planning functions with the five local authorities covering the area, and has the power to &quot;call in&quot; planning decisions made by them. The Authority also takes responsibility for managing access to the countryside that elsewhere falls to local authorities. Aside from the planning and access functions, the National Park Authority has considerable flexibility as to how the four aims are achieved. It can, for example, acquire land, make byelaws and management agreements, provide grants, offer advice, and undertake or commission research. The authority is headquartered in Grantown on Spey.

The National Park Authority is run by a board, consisting of 19 members. Five members are elected by the community and seven are appointed by the Scottish Government. The remaining seven members are nominated by the local authorities, with Highland and Aberdeenshire councils each appointing two members and the remaining three councils appointing one member each.

==Filming in the park==
Some scenes for &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; (that aired from 2000 to 2005) were filmed in the park and nearby on Loch Laggan and Ardverikie House.

In 2012, some scenes for the Batman movie &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; were filmed at Cairngorm Gliding Club&#x27;s site at Feshiebridge. Parachutists jumped from a jet and landed at the club&#x27;s airstrip.

During summer 2019, filming of &quot;No Time to Die&quot; was taking place in the town of Aviemore and in the surrounding park area. Some scenes were also being shot at the Ardverikie House Estate just outside the park.

Other films and television programmes that have done some shooting in the Park area included &quot;Mary Queen of Scots&quot; (2018), &quot;Outlaw King&quot; (Netflix, 2018), &quot;Outlander&quot; (TV series), &quot;Victoria&quot; (TV series, Episode 7), &quot;Mrs Brown&quot; (1997), &quot;Centurion&quot;, &quot;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&quot;, &quot;The Queen&quot; (2006), &quot;The Crown&quot; (Netflix series) and &quot;Victoria &amp; Abdul&quot; (2017).

==Settlements within the national park==

<doc id="624994" wikidata="Q4039563" url="?curid=624994" title="Goldie Lookin Chain">
<text>Goldie Lookin Chain are a British comedy hip hop group from Newport, Wales. The group produces humorous, and often explicit songs that satirise hip hop, today&#x27;s consumer society, the &quot;chav&quot; culture and life in Newport and Wales in general.

==History==
The group recorded six albums prior to securing a major record deal. They signed to East West Records, the home of rock band The Darkness. The band came to the attention of label executive Korda Marshall, who heard the group&#x27;s music played by members of The Darkness whilst on tour. GLC went on to support The Darkness in the latter stages of their UK tour. The group form part of an era known as Cool Cymru for the popularity of Welsh music and arts internationally in that period.

GLC&#x27;s first UK chart entry was &quot;Half Man Half Machine&quot;, which reached the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart. When group member Rhys Hutchings was phoned by BBC chart presenter Wes on the Official Chart Show to be informed of this, Xain informed the rest of the band that they had reached number 1, much to the shock of the DJ. &quot;Half Man Half Machine&quot; was a surreal song about Eggsy believing he was a robot, dressing up in foil, and going to the shops to buy cigarettes and crisps. The song namechecks many well-known 1980s 8-bit computer systems including Binatone, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, ZX81 and BBC Micro.

In August 2004, the group reached number three on the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Guns Don&#x27;t Kill People, Rappers Do&quot;. With the tagline &quot;The gun is the tool, the mind is the weapon&quot;, the track became a popular radio hit, satirising the American hip hop scene. The B-side was the album track &quot;Soapbar&quot;.

Their first nationally released album was called &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, the name a play on both the group&#x27;s previous lack of commercial success and their &quot;stoner&quot; image; it compiled a mixture of new material and selections from their previous six unofficial albums. It was released in September 2004, and debuted at number 5 in the UK Albums Chart. The album was released in May 2005 in the US with the title &quot;Straight Outta Newport,&quot; with cover art similar to N.W.A&#x27;s album &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;. However, this version of the album was missing two tracks – &quot;Maggot&quot; and &quot;You Knows I Loves You&quot;.

Their next single release was &quot;Your Mother&#x27;s Got a Penis&quot;, with an accompanying video based on a supermarket theme. &quot;Your Mother&#x27;s Got a Penis&quot; first appeared on their album &quot;The Manifesto&quot;, and reached No. 14 in the UK.

The band – informally known as &quot;the Chain&quot; or simply &quot;the GLC&quot; – released &quot;You Knows I Loves You Baby&quot;, a parody of 1980s love songs from the albums &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;The Manifesto&quot;, on 13 December 2004; this reached number 22 in the UK chart. &quot;Your Missus Is a Nutter&quot; was the first single from second album &quot;Safe as Fuck&quot;. The album was originally going to be called &quot;Safety in Numbers&quot;, a tribute to the album &quot;Power in Numbers&quot; by alternative L.A. rap group Jurassic 5. The single reached No. 14 in the UK.

In 2005, GLC were invited by the Football Association of Wales (FAW) to perform before the World Cup qualifying match against England at Cardiff&#x27;s Millennium Stadium. The band dedicated &quot;Your Missus Is a Nutter&quot; to David Beckham about his wife, who was present at the match. The ensuing furore, with the Welsh football authorities having to apologise to the Beckhams, as well as expressing outrage at the band&#x27;s perceived lack of respect, prompted many people to question why the organisers, knowing their reputation, had hired them to play in the first place.

On 17 October 2011, GLC released the album &quot;Blue Waffle&quot;, featuring new songs including &quot;Biscuit&quot;, &quot;I Seen Your Mother&quot;, &quot;K Hole&quot; and &quot;If I Told You&quot;. Later that year, group member and Doctor Who fan Adam Hussain contributed a memory about &quot;How a first date was interrupted by The Doctor&quot; to a forthcoming Doctor Who charity book, designed to raise money for Alzheimer&#x27;s Research UK.

GLC released the follow-up to their album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, titled &quot;Greatest Hits 2,&quot; in 2015.

==Sponsorship of Newport County Football Club==
Since their inception in the early 2000s, the group have maintained a close affiliation with their hometown football club, Newport County. GLC sponsored the team&#x27;s kit during the team&#x27;s 2004–05 season. Originally intended only for wear in matches in the FAW Premier Cup, County were drawn away to similarly colour shirted Caernarfon Town in the competition, leading to the club&#x27;s GLC sponsored shirt being worn for two league matches, away to Maidenhead United and at home against Redbridge F.C. In 2021, they designed Newport&#x27;s 3rd kit in collaboration with Hummel.

<text>Chirk () is a town and community in Wrexham County Borough, Wales, south of Wrexham, between it and Oswestry. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 4,468. Historically in the traditional county of Denbighshire, and later Clwyd, it has been part of Wrexham County Borough since a local government reorganisation in 1996. The border with the English county of Shropshire is immediately south of the town, on the other side of the River Ceiriog.

The town is served by Chirk railway station and the A5/A483 roads.

==Etymology==
The name of the town in English, Chirk, derives from the name of the River Ceiriog, which itself may mean &quot;the favoured one&quot;. The Welsh place name, &quot;&quot;, is literally &quot;The Moor&quot;.

==History and heritage==

Chirk Castle, a National Trust property, is a medieval castle. Two families are associated with the town and its castle: the Trevor family of Brynkinallt and the Myddelton family. The Hughes of Gwerclas, a family descended from the ancient kings of Powys Fadog, also lived in the area for many years.

Other aspects of the town include a section of Offa&#x27;s Dyke and the Chirk Aqueduct, part of a larger World Heritage Site including Pontcysyllte aqueduct, on the Llangollen Canal, built in 1801 by Thomas Telford. The Glyn Valley Tramway terminated on the canal near the mainline railway station.

The parish church of St Mary&#x27;s is a Grade I listed building. The church building was begun during the 11th century by the Normans, although it is believed that an older &quot;llan&quot;, dedicated to St Tysilio, had pre-existed on the site. The existing church was dedicated to St Tysilio until the late 15th or early 16th century, after which it was re-dedicated to St Mary. Today, the church is a member of the Open Church Network and participates in the Sacred Space Project.

Chirk was formerly a coal mining community from the 17th to the 20th century. The two largest collieries were Black Park (one of the oldest in the north of Wales) and Brynkinallt (). These coal mines have now closed.

Chirk was a coaching stop on the old mail coach route along the A5 from London to Holyhead.

The Chester to Ruabon railway had been extended south to Shrewsbury by 1848, with stations at Llangollen Road (Whitehurst Halt, near Pentre) and Chirk; the Castle owners insisted that the railway not be visible to them and that the station be well outside the town lest it should encourage the populace to travel. South of the town a railway viaduct was constructed by Henry Robertson to take the line over the Ceiriog Valley.

The Llangollen branch of the Shropshire Union Canal runs through Chirk. The canal crosses the Ceiriog Valley (from England into Wales) along Thomas Telford&#x27;s aqueduct. The aqueduct runs alongside the railway viaduct before the canal enters the Chirk Tunnel.

==Modern day==

Agriculture continues to be of some importance, as does tourism. The National Trust&#x27;s Chirk Castle has prominence, as does the World Heritage Site of the Llangollen Canal, and the local scenery of the Ceiriog Valley and Berwyn Mountains. Manufacturing now plays a prominent position within the local industries, with major international firms such as Kronospan and Mondelez UK maintaining sites in the town. 

Religion no longer has a prominent position, but there are four churches: St Mary&#x27;s (Church in Wales), Chirk Methodist Church, Sacred Heart (Roman Catholic) and the Community Church.

Chirk is served by two local primary schools: Ysgol Y Waun and Pentre Church in Wales Controlled School. Ysgol Y Waun is the main primary school. It was formed in 2012, by the merger of Chirk Infants and Ceiriog Junior. Ysgol Y Waun is a nursery, infant and junior school of mixed gender and lessons are taught through the medium of English. The school has about 335 pupils, with an increasing number of pupils on free school meals: 19.7% in 2014, which is above the Local Authority average but below the Wales average.

Pentre School is a nursery, infant and junior school of mixed gender. There are approximately 86 pupils on roll who are all taught through the medium of English. Welsh is taught as a compulsory part of the school curriculum as a second language. The school is in a relatively affluent area, with only 15.9% of the school population eligible for free school meals, which is substantially below the Local Authority and Wales averages.

Most pupils in the community attend Ysgol Dinas Brân, Llangollen, for their secondary education. Ysgol Dinas Brân is a relatively large, bilingual secondary school catering for pupils from ages 11 – 19 (including Sixth Form). Other secondary schools in the area include Ysgol Rhiwabon, St Martin&#x27;s School (Shropshire) and St Joseph&#x27;s in Wrexham. The area is served by independent schools, such as Moreton Hall and Ellesmere College in neighbouring Shropshire.

Although Chirk is a predominantly English-speaking area, some parents choose to educate their children through the medium of Welsh. The nearest Welsh-medium primary schools are in Glyn Ceiriog and Cefn Mawr. Pupils can then transfer to either Ysgol Dinas Brân, Llangollen or Ysgol Morgan Llwyd, Wrexham for Welsh-medium secondary education.

The Ceiriog Memorial Institute, in the Ceiriog valley, just west of Chirk, is home to a collection of Welsh cultural memorabilia and was founded in the early 1900s to support the Welsh language, culture and heritage for future generations.

In the 2011 census, a total of 3,652 residents (81.7%) have no skills in the Welsh language.

==Sport==
Chirk is home to Chirk AAA F.C., a football team founded in 1876, playing in the Cymru North (the second tier of Welsh football). Chirk AAA FC have a plaque in honour of Billy Meredith, born in the town, and with which Meredith started his career between 1890-92. Meredith returned briefly in 1894 before signing for Manchester City. A second plaque to Meredith is situated in Chirk&#x27;s Millennium Gardens at the Station Avenue entrance to the park and cricket club. It was unveiled on 26 July 2002 by Meredith&#x27;s daughter Winifrede.

Chirk Golf Club was founded in 1991 and closed in September 2012.

==Media==
The town receives better television signals from the Wrekin TV transmitter which broadcasts BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. BBC Cymru Wales and ITV Cymru Wales are also received from the local relay station at the Moel-y-Parc transmitter situated near Cefn Mawr.

Radio stations that broadcast to the town are:
* BBC Radio Wales on 91.1 FM
* BBC Radio Cymru on 104.3 FM
* Heart North and Mid Wales on 88.0 FM
* Capital North West &amp; Wales on 103.4 FM
* Calon FM, a community based station which broadcast from Wrexham on 105 FM.

<doc id="624998" wikidata="Q838973" url="?curid=624998" title="Money (Pink Floyd song)">
<text>&quot;Money&quot; is a song by English rock band Pink Floyd from their 1973 album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. Written by Roger Waters, it opened side two of the original album. Released as a single, it became the band&#x27;s first hit in the United States, reaching number 10 in &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine and number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. 

Distinctive elements of the song include its unusual time signature, and the tape loop of money-related sound effects (such as a ringing cash register and a jingle of coins). These effects are timed right on the beats, and act as a count-in at the beginning to set the tempo and are heard periodically throughout the song.

The song was regularly performed by Pink Floyd and played on most tours since 1972, and has since been performed by David Gilmour and Waters on their respective solo tours. Gilmour re-recorded the song in 1981, while Waters released a re-recording of the song in 2023.

==Composition==
&quot;Money&quot; has been described as a progressive rock, blues rock, and hard rock song. Much of the song has an unusual time signature, . Waters wrote the central riff on an acoustic guitar, and chose the time signature as it fitted the &quot;bluesy feel&quot; of the song.

The form and chord progression are based on the standard twelve-bar blues in the key of B minor, with the vocal melody and nearly all of Gilmour&#x27;s soloing based on the pentatonic and blues scales. Two twelve-bar verses are followed by a twenty-bar instrumental section that features a blues-style tenor saxophone solo played by Dick Parry, along with keyboard, bass and drums and a further two-bar intro in leading to the guitar solo, which is structured like a twelve-bar blues, but doubled to a twenty-four-bar length.

Waters wrote the lyrics to demonstrate irony and criticising the power of money and the capitalism system generally. &quot;Money interested me enormously,&quot; Waters remarked on the twentieth anniversary of &quot;Dark Side&quot;. &quot;I remember thinking, &#x27;Well, this is it and I have to decide whether I&#x27;m really a socialist or not.&#x27; I&#x27;m still keen on a general welfare society, but I became a capitalist. You have to accept it. I remember coveting a Bentley like crazy. The only way to get something like that was through rock or the football pools. I very much wanted all that material stuff.&quot; In another interview, he said he was &quot;sure that the free market isn&#x27;t the whole answer ... my hope is that mankind will evolve into a more co-operative and less competitive beast&quot;.

==Recording==
&quot;Money&quot; begins with the rhythmic sequence of sound effects that is heard throughout the first several bars. This was created by splicing together recordings Waters had made of clinking coins, a ringing cash register, tearing paper, a clicking counting machine and other items to construct a seven-beat effects loop. The original loop was used for early live performances, but had to be re-recorded onto multi track tape for the album. It was later adapted to four tracks in order to create a &quot;walk around the room&quot; effect in the quadraphonic mix of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.

The demo tracks for the song, including some of the sound effects, were recorded in a makeshift recording studio Roger Waters had in his garden shed. As recorded by the band, the song has a &quot;bluesy, transatlantic feel&quot;, unlike Waters&#x27; original demo version, which he later described as &quot;prissy and very English&quot;. As heard on &quot;Classic Albums: Pink Floyd – The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, the demo is in the key of G-sharp minor, as opposed to the B minor of the final version.

Recording of Pink Floyd&#x27;s version began on 6 June 1972 at Abbey Road Studios with a new recording of the sound effects. Some effects such as the cash register were taken from existing sound libraries. The one inch tape with the effects was then transferred onto a quarter inch tape that could be overdubbed. After this, the band performed a run-through of the backing track live the following day. Richard Wright played a Wurlitzer electronic piano through a wah wah pedal, while Gilmour played a straightforward rhythm part. Waters later remarked the live-run through meant the group gradually sped up through the recording. Engineer Alan Parsons gradually faded out the loop before the vocals started. As the song progressed, the band gradually sped up, yet later, between the first and second verses, Parsons briefly raised up the volume of the effects loop, and just by coincidence, it turned out to fit the beat. After this point, the loop is not heard again.

After the backing track was completed, Nick Mason overdubbed some drums, and Wright recorded a new electric piano part on 8 June. Gilmour then recorded three individual guitar solos. The first was played using a fuzz face and a Binson Echorec, giving it a strongly reverberated sound. It was then double tracked. The second solo was recorded &quot;dry&quot; without any reverb and delay effects, while the third was recorded with similar settings to the first, but using a customised Lewis guitar with twenty-four frets, allowing a full four-octave range. This solo was doubled using automatic double tracking.

According to mix supervisor Chris Thomas, Gilmour wanted to record guitar tracks live, and not add effects later. Thomas also asked Gilmour to double the descending riff at the end of the solo, so it would sound &quot;really big&quot; leading into the last verse, and to double the bass riff on guitar so it could stand out more.

Dick Parry added his saxophone solo on 27 October. The group didn&#x27;t know many other musicians and asked Parry as he was an old friend of Gilmour. Gilmour sang the lead vocal, which was also double tracked, including scat singing in response to some improvised guitar lines during the outro.

Various voices can be heard talking as the track fades out into the next song, &quot;Us and Them&quot;. Roger Waters asked people who were present in the studio at the time random questions, and recorded their responses to add to the song. Paul McCartney, who happened to be in the studio at the time of the recording, was questioned as well but his answer never made the final cut. However, Wings&#x27; guitarist Henry McCullough did contribute the line &quot;I don&#x27;t know, I was really drunk at the time&quot;. Other lines included roadie Peter Watts&#x27;s wife Patricia: &quot;I was definitely in the right. That geezer was cruising for a bruising&quot; and roadie Chris Adamson: &quot;So after, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn&#x27;t coming up on fader eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out.&quot;

==Release==
The single was released in the US on 7 May 1973 in a shorter version, with most of the saxophone and guitar solos edited out. A special promotional single was released for radio stations containing a stereo and mono mix on, with the word &quot;bullshit&quot; intended to be censored. However, the stereo mix accidentally contained the uncensored version, so a new pressing had to be issued.

&quot;Money&quot; was Pink Floyd&#x27;s first major hit in the US, reaching a peak of No. 13 in the Billboard Hot 100. It also topped the charts in France and was a top ten hit in Austria.

==Re-recording==
The song was re-recorded for the 1981 Pink Floyd album, &quot;A Collection of Great Dance Songs&quot;, because Capitol Records refused to licence the track to Columbia Records in the United States. With the help of co-producer James Guthrie, David Gilmour re-recorded the song, providing the vocals and playing all the instruments except saxophone, where Parry reprised his role. This recording was released as a single.

The quadraphonic version was also released on the LP &quot;Quadrafile&quot;, a demonstration record released in 1976. This release was intended to allow the listener to compare the same material as heard in 4 different quadraphonic encoding formats: SQ, QS Regular Matrix, CD-4 and UD-4. &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; were also released in the SQ format.

==Live==
&quot;Money&quot; has been regularly performed by Pink Floyd throughout their career. The first performance was at The Dome, Brighton on 20 January 1972 as part of the &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; suite, but this was abandoned after a few bars due to problems with the taped sound effects. After a delay, the group decided to play &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; instead. The first complete performance was the following day at the Guildhall, Portsmouth. It was performed regularly along with the rest of &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; up until the concert at Knebworth Park on 5 July 1975. It was then performed as an encore on the 1977 &quot;In The Flesh&quot; tour. These later performances would typically last as long as twelve minutes, with the song&#x27;s solo being elongated with multiple additional sections.

When this song was performed in Montreal on 6 July 1977, a disruptive fan angered Waters by throwing a beer bottle onto the stage. While the band played during the jam section, Waters called the fan onto the stage, then spat in his face after pretending to help him up. This concert, of which bootleg recordings exist, has been cited as a catalyst for Pink Floyd&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Wall&quot;.

Pink Floyd performed the song during the tours supporting &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot;, and &quot;The Division Bell&quot;, after Waters had left the group.

Gilmour played the song regularly during his 1984 US tour in support of the solo album &quot;About Face&quot; and the song would be expanded up to 12 minutes. He also played the song regularly during his Rattle That Lock Tour in 2015 and 2016 and again was expanded.

Waters has also regularly included it on his solo tours, including those for The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking and Radio K.A.O.S. For the American part of his In the Flesh tour, it was sung by Doyle Bramhall II, while for the European part it was sung by Chester Kamen. For &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon Live&quot;, it was sung by Dave Kilminster. &quot;Money&quot; was also performed by Waters at Live Earth&#x27;s Concert at Giants Stadium on 7 July 2007.

&quot;Money&quot; was performed during Pink Floyd&#x27;s reunion show, for which Waters rejoined the band (after more than two decades), at the Live 8 concert in London in 2005, along with &quot;Breathe&quot; (including the reprise that follows &quot;Time&quot;), &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;. Unusually for a live Pink Floyd performance, at Live 8 the band kept the song&#x27;s solo to three choruses, as it is on the album.

==Reception==
&quot;Money&quot; is the only song from &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; to make its appearance on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 list of 1973, where it was ranked 92. In 2008, &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine listed David Gilmour&#x27;s solo on &quot;Money&quot; as No. 62 among readers&#x27; votes for &quot;The Greatest 100 Guitar Solos.&quot; The song was also ranked No. 69 on the list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot; of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. This song avoids more typical Pink Floyd themes such as paranoia, insanity, the meaning of life, and the passage of time. Instead, the lyrics criticise crass materialism.

The commercial success of &quot;Money&quot; as a single changed Pink Floyd&#x27;s career, moving them from a cult band to major stars. This caused problems at gigs, as audiences wanted to hear the song and not lengthy instrumental passages that had been a key part of concerts to that point.

==Video==
The music video for &quot;Money&quot; features scenes of various ways of making and spending money, and includes brief close-ups of a coin spinning, coins flowing in a mint, gold ingots in a bank, and a record copy of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; on a turntable. In addition, the video also includes shots of the album making its way down a conveyor belt in a factory/distribution plant. It also has shots of people living in apparent poverty, as well as shots of gramophone records and audio equipment being destroyed by explosives during the song&#x27;s bridge.

== Roger Waters version ==
In early 2023, Waters announced that for the 50th anniversary of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, he would be doing a full re-recording of the record without the rest of Pink Floyd that would re-address the political and emotional statements on that record. The record&#x27;s name, cover, and lead single, the re-recording of &quot;Money&quot; was released on 21 July 2023. The track also had a lyric video released alongside it.

Unlike the original track, the new version of &quot;Money&quot; has been described as being &quot;eerie&quot; and having ominous, near-whispering and crooning vocals from Waters. Furthermore, it is also notably slower than the original and features a spoken word segment in the middle, which &quot;only adds to the surrealism&quot;. The track overall has also been described as being more bluesy than rock and drawn comparisons to Leonard Cohen.

<doc id="625002" wikidata="Q631340" url="?curid=625002" title="Talgarth">
<text>Talgarth is a market town, community and electoral ward in southern Powys, Mid Wales, about north of Crickhowell, north-east of Brecon and south-east of Builth Wells. Notable buildings in the town include the 14th-century parish church and a defensive tower house. According to traditional accounts, Talgarth was the capital of the early medieval kingdom of Brycheiniog. It is in the historic county of Brecknockshire. In 2011, it had a population of 1,724.

==Name==
The town&#x27;s name derives from the Welsh words &quot;tâl&quot; (forehead or brow of a hill) and &quot;garth&quot; (mountain ridge or promontory), thus meaning &quot;end of the ridge&quot;. It appears as Talgart in 1121, as Talgard after 1130, and in its present form in the years between 1203 and 1208.

The church of Talgarth is recorded in 1488 as dedicated to &quot;Sce Wenne Virginis&quot;, explained as Gwen (granddaughter of Brychan).

==Culture and community==
The Talgarth Festival of the Black Mountains, a popular countryside event, is held each August. Talgarth Walking Festival takes place in May, making use of the town&#x27;s position at the foot of the Black Mountains.
Talgarth was an important healthcare location for many years, as the home of the large psychiatric hospital, the Mid Wales Hospital and the Mid and West Wales College of Nursing and Midwifery. Changes in health legislation in the 1980s saw such hospitals closed. The Mid Wales Hospital closed permanently in the 1990s. Since the early 2000s, regeneration efforts have been in place to support Talgarth&#x27;s future. A relief road has reduced road traffic in the town centre, allowing new businesses to open and buildings to be renovated and restored. The historic mill in the centre of town featured on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Village SOS&quot; television series.

==History==
===Roman period===
A fort near Cwmdu (Pen-y-Gaer) is of significance to Talgarth, as it was the site where a 1st-century AD British chieftain, Caratacus (of the Catuvellauni tribe), fought with the Romans.

===The Dark Ages===
Talgarth was the royal residence of Brychan, King of Brycheiniog, in the 5th century AD. With three wives, 24 daughters and 24 sons, the family was an important force in Wales and responsible for the spread of Christianity throughout the region.

===The Normans===
Talgarth (and Brycheiniog in general) was seized by the Norman Bernard of Neufmarché, who issued an undated charter concerning the district. The town became part of Bernard&#x27;s Lordship of Brecknock (a Marcher lordship – an almost sovereign state). The Normans established Castell Dinas to control the passes on both sides.

In the reign of King John, the then Lord fell out with the king, and the east of the lordship was detached in punishment, forming a new Marcher Lordship of Blaenllynfi, ruled by Peter FitzHerbert. Although the caput of the latter lordship was officially Blaenllynfi Castle, Talgarth was its principal town, and the lordship was sometimes called the Sub-Lordship of Talgarth as a result.

The Lordship of Blaenllynfi eventually found its way back to the descendants of the last Welsh princes of Brycheiniog (in the person of Rhys ap Hywel).

Rhys played a significant part in the implementation (though not the planning) of the final coup against Edward II, and consequently Edward&#x27;s son, Edward III, was not well disposed towards him; he dispossessed Rhys&#x27; heir, and merged the Lordship of Blaenllynfi back into the Lordship of Brecknock (which, with the Lordship of Buellt, eventually became Brecknockshire, centuries later).

===The Welsh Jacobites===
During the Jacobite revival, support in Talgarth was strong. The town was a Jacobite hotspot, backing Bonnie Prince Charlie in his attempt to retake the crown for the Stuarts. In 1727 a meeting of local Jacobite sympathisers in Talgarth ended with members having to appear before a local magistrate to explain their actions.

During the Jacobite rising of 1745, Bonnie Prince Charlie had expected the Welsh Jacobites to offer support, but after the Jacobite David Morgan was hanged, drawn and quartered for treason, the Welsh feared persecution. The failure of the Welsh Jacobites to join the House of Stuart prince in Derby was one of the main failures of the Jacobite uprising.

===The Methodist revival===
In 1735, Talgarth saw the birth of the Welsh Methodist revival when Howel Harris, probably the most influential person to come from Talgarth, was converted in Talgarth church while listening to a sermon by the Reverend Pryce Davies. The revival would sweep across Wales, leading to the development of one of the most influential Welsh denominations, that of the Calvinistic Methodists. It was at Talgarth that William Williams Pantycelyn converted, leading him to become one of Wales&#x27; most important hymn writers. Nearby is Trevecca, the location of the famous college that Harris established. Hywel Harris is buried in Talgarth at St Gwendoline&#x27;s Church and his tombstone is still visible today. Talgarth is also thought to be the birthplace of the religious poet Jane Cave.

==Buildings and other sites of note==
*Talgarth Town Hall (1878) with a memorial clock tower, overlooking the Square
*Tower House, also overlooking the Square, now the location of the Tourist Information Centre. The present building is probably 18th century, but it may incorporate a 14th-century or later defensive tower. The tower was used as a prison or a lock-up.
*The Tower Hotel was built in 1873 for gentleman farmers to attend the livestock market
*St Gwendoline&#x27;s Church, a Grade II* listed building
*Nearby Bronllys Castle

=== Talgarth Mill ===
Talgarth Mill is an 18th-century water mill in the centre of the town. In 2010 the mill, which had been unused since 1946, was fully restored using National Lottery funding to create the only working watermill in the Brecon Beacons National Park. The mill is run by volunteers as a community initiative; it includes a bakery and a cafe and sells locally made food and crafts.
===Railway station===
Talgarth was served by a station on the Mid-Wales Railway. This has since closed.

=== Chambered tomb – Penyrwrlodd ===
A Neolithic long cairn and chambered tomb at Penyrwrlodd, south of Talgarth, was discovered in June 1972 by a farmer when clearing a stone mound from a field for use as hard-standing in the farmyard. The cairn measures 5m by 22.5m and a maximum 3m high, and has been carbon dated to 3,900 BC, making it an early example of its type. The discovery led to archaeological excavation of the site by Dr Savory of the National Museum of Wales. During the excavation a number of human remains were found along with a bone flute, a human rib and some worked flints and stone. The flute was made from a sheep metapodial bone, has three holes and may either have been a simple flute or whistle.

=== The Old Post Office Museum ===
The former Post Office was restored in 2019.

== Outdoor activities ==

===Gliding===
The Black Mountains Gliding Club is based on the hillside to the southeast of the town. It operates year-round using mountain lift, ridge lift and wave lift mechanisms.

===Pony trekking===
Talgarth&#x27;s position next to the Black Mountains meant that it was once a popular location for pony trekking, with the sights of horses tied up outside local pubs well into the 1990s. There remain a number of riding operators in the area who hire out horses for both experienced and novice riders.

===Walking===
The Black Mountains above the town are used for upland hiking and hill-walking. The mountain ridges are around 2,000 feet high, with the highest point being Waun Fach at . A walking festival based on the town and its hinterland was established in 2013. The event attracts visitors at the start of May each year.

==Landscape and natural history==

===Geology===
The bedrock geology beneath Talgarth and its immediate neighbourhood consists of mudstones and siltstones together with occasional sandstones, which comprise a part of the lower Old Red Sandstone succession. The rocks directly beneath the town itself are assigned to the late Silurian / early Devonian age Raglan Mudstone Formation, whilst higher ground to the south and east of the town is formed by the overlying St Maughan&#x27;s Formation. At the boundary between these two formations is a thick unit of erosion-resistant limestone, which forms features in the courses of the River Ennig and other streams. Known traditionally as the Psammosteus Limestone, it was later referred to as the Bishop&#x27;s Frome Limestone and more recently as the Chapel Point Limestone. This and similar limestone beds in the area are examples of calcretes, effectively carbonate-rich fossil soils, formed over thousands of years at times of non-deposition of sand and mud. Fish fragments are abundant in some strata exposed in local streamsides.

Within the Raglan Mudstone, and exposed in certain watercourses, is a distinctive rock layer known as the Townsend Tuff Bed, a tuff being a deposit of volcanic ash which has fallen from the sky, likely following a Plinian volcanic eruption in this instance.

===Pwll-y-Wrach===

The Pwll-y-Wrach woodland stretches along both banks of the River Ennig at Pwll-y-Wrach to within of Talgarth town centre. It is designated in part as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to various uncommon plants, including the small-leaved lime tree and the lesser butterfly-orchid, both regarded as indicators of ancient woodland. The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales manage of the SSSI as a nature reserve. Rare species present include toothwort and bird&#x27;s nest orchid. Initially smaller in extent, the reserve was established by the former Brecknock Wildlife Trust in 1984. In spring, wildflowers include bluebells followed by ramsons. The wood is home to the most important colony of dormice in the region and is also home to the lesser horseshoe bat.

There are a series of waterfalls within the wood, of which the largest is Pwll-y-Wrach, formed by a cap of the Chapel Point Limestone overlying of siltstones. The name means &#x27;witch&#x27;s pool&#x27;.

==Governance==

Talgarth Town Council has twelve councillors representing the views of the community.

The Talgarth ward elects a county councillor to Powys County Council. Since May 2004 it had been represented by Liberal Democrat councillor, William Powell (who also sits on the Town Council). He was re-elected unopposed in 2008 and 2012. Powell was also an elected Assembly Member of the National Assembly for Wales from 2011 to 2016.

<text>Ystradfellte () is a village and community in Powys, Wales, about north of Hirwaun, with 556 inhabitants. It belongs to the historic county of Brecknockshire (Breconshire) and the Fforest Fawr area of the Brecon Beacons National Park, beside the Afon Mellte river. The village is linked by minor roads with Heol Senni to the north and the A4059 north of Penderyn, and with Pontneddfechan, which lies in the community, at the head of the Vale of Neath to the south.

==History==
Ystradfellte is chiefly known in history as the place where the Welsh nobleman and rebel leader Llywelyn Bren surrendered at the end of his revolt of 1316. Llywelyn gave himself up on the condition that his men be spared, but was himself put to death in 1318 at Cardiff.

The village was connected to mains electricity in 1960, as one of the last communities in the whole of England and Wales to be wired. Outlying properties in the Nedd Fechan valley had to wait until December 2005 for their connection.

==Features==
The village is a popular tourist centre for its hillwalking, waterfalls and caves along the nearby rivers. Ystradfellte has a public house, the &quot;New Inn&quot;, which provides camping facilities for visitors, and Croydon Caving Club. It comes under Aberdare for postal purposes making it the only part of Powys that Ocado deliver to. 

The surrounding area is renowned for its caves and karst scenery, making caving a popular activity. Some of the more famous caves near the village include:
*Porth yr Ogof, with the biggest cave entrance in Wales, into which the River Mellte flows.
*Little Neath River Cave.

The area is seen as part of Waterfall Country. A popular attraction near the village is the Waterfalls Walk, an easier walk along the Afon Mellte past two main falls on the river, &quot;Sgwd Clun-gwyn&quot; and &quot;Sgwd Isaf Clun-gwyn&quot;, to &quot;Sgwd yr Eira&quot; on the Afon Hepste, where the footpath passes behind the waterfall.
==Notable people==
* Evan Bevan (1803–1866), the Welsh-language poet, moved to Ystradfellte as a young adult.
* Barbara Brooke, Baroness Brooke of Ystradfellte (1908–2000), a Conservative Party politician.

<doc id="625007" wikidata="Q538218" url="?curid=625007" title="Meadowlands Arena">
<text>Meadowlands Arena (formerly Brendan Byrne Arena, Continental Airlines Arena and Izod Center) is a closed indoor sports and concert venue located in the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, United States. Since closing, the state-owned facility has been used as a rehearsal stage by major concert-touring music stars and by NBCUniversal for television filming. The arena is located on New Jersey Route 120 across the highway from MetLife Stadium and the Meadowlands Racetrack, next to the American Dream shopping and entertainment complex.

The arena, which opened in 1981, was originally built to accommodate the New Jersey Nets basketball team. In 1982, the relocated Colorado Rockies hockey team became the New Jersey Devils and joined the Nets at the venue. In 1985, the Seton Hall Pirates men&#x27;s collegiate basketball team began playing its home games at the arena. In 2007, the Prudential Center opened in nearby Newark as the new Devils home arena. Seton Hall, whose campus in South Orange is closer to Newark than East Rutherford, likewise moved its basketball games there. The Nets remained at the Meadowlands for three more seasons before moving to Newark, where they played two seasons before departing New Jersey for Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The men&#x27;s basketball team from Fordham University played four home games during the 2010–11 season at the arena.

Following the departure of all three of its major tenants, the arena continued to host occasional non-sporting events, such as touring shows and concerts, and other local events. The state-owned facility reported losses for 2013, and was projected to have $8.5 million in losses for 2015. On January 15, 2015, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority (NJSEA) voted to shut down Izod Center, and have Prudential Center acquire hosting rights to events scheduled for the arena over the next two years in a $2 million deal.

Since closing, the vacant arena has been used as a rehearsal venue for large-scale touring concert productions as well as a sound stage for video and television productions. Since 2018, NBC has leased the venue to film prime-time drama series, including &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; and &quot;Lincoln Rhyme: Hunt for the Bone Collector&quot;. It is also home to the crime drama series &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, starring Queen Latifah, and the TV programs &quot;Tales of the Walking Dead&quot; and &quot;The Walking Dead: Dead City&quot;.

==History==

Construction on a new arena across Route 20 (now 120) from Giants Stadium and the Meadowlands Racetrack began in 1977, with the arena&#x27;s initial purpose being to serve as the primary home for the Nets who had moved from Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York to New Jersey. While the venue was being built, the Nets played their home games in Piscataway at the Rutgers Athletic Center.

The arena was designed by Grad Partnership and Dilullo, Clauss, Ostroki &amp; Partners and was constructed at a cost of $85 million. Originally named the Brendan Byrne Arena, after the sitting governor of New Jersey, Brendan Byrne, the building opened on July 2, 1981, with the first of six concerts by New Jersey rock musician Bruce Springsteen. The Nets moved into their new home on October 30, 1981, and lost to their cross-river rivals, the New York Knicks in their inaugural home game. In 1982, the arena hosted the NBA All-Star Game. Then, it hosted the 1996 NBA draft.

Another motivation for building an arena in the Meadowlands was to potentially lure a National Hockey League team to New Jersey. Governor Byrne was a member of an ownership group that was looking to do so, and in 1978 businessman Arthur Imperatore purchased the Colorado Rockies and announced that he would be relocating the team to New Jersey. Unfortunately for Imperatore, the Rockies would be sold twice more before that finally became a reality. The newly renamed, John McMullen-owned New Jersey Devils played their first game at the arena on October 5, 1982, against the Pittsburgh Penguins, with the game ending in a 3–3 tie. Don Lever scored the first goal in the arena, which was the Devils&#x27; very first goal. In 1984, the arena hosted the NHL All-Star Game. The following year, the Seton Hall Pirates men&#x27;s basketball team began playing at the arena.

On January 4, 1996, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority (NJSEA) announced a naming rights deal with Continental Airlines under which the airline, with a hub at nearby Newark Liberty International Airport, would pay the NJSEA $29 million over 12 years. As Continental Airlines Arena, it hosted the 1996 Final Four—the last Final Four to date that has been held in an arena specifically built for basketball.

In September 2006, the Nets and the NJSEA announced an extension of their lease to keep the team in the Meadowlands until 2013, with a provision to leave as early as 2009 if the Brooklyn arena was completed. It was reported at the time that the Nets&#x27; owner, Bruce Ratner was seeking to sell the Nets, thus thwarting any possible move to Brooklyn.

On May 5, 2007, the Devils played their last game at the arena, losing 3–2 to the Ottawa Senators, eliminating them from the Eastern Conference semifinals 4–1. Scott Gomez scored the final goal in the building. The Devils subsequently relocated to the newly constructed Prudential Center in nearby Newark at the beginning of the 2007–08 NHL season.

Following the Devils&#x27; final season at the arena in 2007, Continental Airlines opted out of the naming rights agreement and the NJSEA signed an agreement with Izod for five years. The company paid $1.4 million per year for the first two years of the agreement; when the Nets left, it dropped to $750,000 per year for the balance of the five-year deal. The columns of the Izod Center&#x27;s exterior were also repainted red as the arena assumed a new color scheme.

In 2009, Newark mayor Cory Booker and Devils owner Jeffrey Vanderbeek called for the closing of the Izod Center, because it was a competing venue to the Prudential Center for events, and a &quot;drain on taxpayers.&quot; In October 2009, a deal was brokered for the Nets to play at the Prudential Center for two seasons, beginning in the 2010–11 NBA season. The deal also included a partnership with the Prudential Center hosting sporting events (Devils, Nets, Seton Hall), and the Izod Center handling concerts and family shows. The two arenas proposed a joint venture, Jersey Presents LLC, to wrestle leverage from promoters who had been playing the two against each other. &quot;You can’t have two venues that close together fighting each other and have that be productive for the state,&quot; said Jerry Zaro, economic czar to former New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, who brokered the deal. The Nets&#x27; agreement to play the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons in Newark was finalized on February 18, 2010. On April 12, 2010, the Nets played their final game at the Izod Center, a 105–95 loss to the Charlotte Bobcats. Terrence Williams made the final basket in the arena.

===Shutdown===
With the loss of its major tenants, the Izod Center served primarily as a venue for traveling events, such as concerts, ice shows, and other occasional local events such as graduation ceremonies. New Jersey&#x27;s government considered possible options for the arena, including selling or leasing it to another operator, or closing it entirely. Triple Five Group had attempted to negotiate taking over the arena so it could be incorporated into the nearby American Dream Meadowlands complex, but the deal fell through. The arena reported losses for 2013, also facing competition from Barclays Center in landing major concerts, and it was estimated that the arena would lose $8.5 million over the course of 2015. Even with its use during Super Bowl XLVIII, Izod Center reported a $45,800 loss from the event.

On January 15, 2015, as urged by state governor Chris Christie, the NJSEA voted to close Izod Center. Under a two-year, $2 million agreement with Devils Arena Entertainment LLC, most future events scheduled for Izod Center were moved to Prudential Center. While the arena was originally expected to be shut down by the end of January, its final event was a Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey circus event on March 22, 2015. Under the terms of the agreement, the operators of Prudential Center were held responsible for staffing and logistics for shows held after January 31 but was entitled to receive the profits from such events.

On July 14, 2016, &quot;The Record&quot; reported that Devils Arena Entertainment had yet to pay the first $500,000 installment of its $2 million agreement with the NJSEA. On August 11, 2016, the NJSEA announced that it would allow musicians to book the arena for use as a rehearsal facility. Prudential Center president Hugh Weber noted that Coldplay had similarly done so prior to their tour stop at nearby MetLife Stadium, and that while Prudential Center has frequently seen similar bookings, there is a large backlog due to the venue&#x27;s high traffic. The NJSEA and the Prudential Center will share the revenue generated by the rehearsals.

==Usage==
===Sports===
The arena has primarily served as a sports venue in its history. The arena was the home of the NBA&#x27;s New Jersey Nets basketball franchise from 1981 to 2010. It was the home arena for the NHL&#x27;s New Jersey Devils hockey franchise from 1982 to 2007 and the NCAA&#x27;s Seton Hall Pirates men&#x27;s basketball team from 1982 to 2007 as well as continuing to play host to various regular season men&#x27;s college basketball. The last game being played on December 18, 2014, between the Duke Blue Devils and UConn Huskies. Izod Center used two separate floors for NBA and NCAA basketball—a standard hardwood floor for Nets and the arena&#x27;s old parquet floor for regular season college basketball (since 2007, the NCAA has used a uniform floor for regional sites).

College basketball first arrived at the arena with the opening rounds of the 1984 NCAA basketball tournament. Seton Hall moved its Big East Conference men&#x27;s basketball games to the arena for the 1985–86 season. The arena hosted the NCAA Men&#x27;s Final Four in 1996, the last traditional arena to do so to date. On eleven occasions (1986–1991, 1993, 1995, 1999, 2004, 2007) the arena hosted the semifinals and finals of the tournament&#x27;s East Regional. Only Kansas City&#x27;s Municipal Auditorium, which hosted 13 regional finals from 1940 to 1952, has hosted more. It also hosted the 1982–1989 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference and 1986 Atlantic Ten Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournaments.

On January 22, 1987, after New Jersey was hit with of snow, only 334 fans attended the Devils&#x27; 7–5 victory over the Calgary Flames, a record for the lowest attendance for a game in modern NHL history.

Other teams that have called the arena home include the New Jersey Rockets of the Major Indoor Soccer League, the New Jersey Rockin&#x27; Rollers of Roller Hockey International, the New Jersey XTreme of the National Indoor Football League, and the New Jersey Red Dogs / Gladiators of the Arena Football League. Two different National Lacrosse League teams have played at the arena—the New Jersey Saints from 1987 to 1988, and the New Jersey Storm from 2002 to 2003. The New York Cosmos also used the arena to host indoor matches, and the last NASL indoor game was played at the arena on April 11, 1984 – the Cosmos lost to the San Diego Sockers, 7–3, in front of 4,717 fans, giving the Sockers a sweep of the best-of-five series.

On February 12, 2011, the arena hosted . In November 2011, the Izod Center was the host of the final round of the TicketCity Legends Classic. The UFC on Fox 3 event took place at the arena on May 5, 2012.

====Championships====
Meadowlands Arena played host to the , , , and Stanley Cup Finals. The arena saw the Devils clinch two of their three Stanley Cup championships before a home crowd, winning Game 4 of the 1995 Finals over the Detroit Red Wings and Game 7 of the 2003 Finals over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim; the Devils&#x27; other Stanley Cup win took place in Game 6 of the 2000 Finals over the Dallas Stars at Dallas&#x27; Reunion Arena. The Devils lost in the 2001 Finals in seven games to the Colorado Avalanche. The arena also was host to the Los Angeles Lakers winning an NBA Championship by sweeping the Nets on June 12, 2002, and again the next year, when the Nets lost in six games to the San Antonio Spurs. Izod Center is the most recent of five venues to host the Stanley Cup Finals and NBA Finals at the same time; the other four are Boston Garden, Madison Square Garden in New York, The Spectrum in Philadelphia and Chicago Stadium. Game 3 of the 1983-84 NASL Indoor Finals was played there on April 11, 1984, between the Cosmos and the San Diego Sockers. This also happened to be the last indoor game played in the North American Soccer League, as the league folded in early 1985. It was one of the busiest arenas in North America in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, playing host to numerous championship and neutral games.

The arena also hosted the NCAA Men&#x27;s Final Four (basketball) in 1996, which was won by the University of Kentucky, and included Syracuse University, the University of Massachusetts, and Mississippi State University.

===Concerts===

The arena was a popular site for concerts, having been designed with acoustics in mind and requiring a smaller facility fee for artists than competing venues, such as Madison Square Garden.

Bruce Springsteen remains one of the most popular concert acts; his appearances have included a six-night run to open the arena in July 1981, a 10-night sold-out run in 1984, an 11-night run in 1992 and a 15-night sold-out run in 1999. This last feat was commemorated by a large banner hanging from the rafters, next to the banners representing the achievements of the resident sports teams. Springsteen would return to the arena for concerts in 2002, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2012. Additionally, a number of tracks from Springsteen&#x27;s 1986 live album &quot;Live/1975-85&quot; were recorded at the arena during concerts in 1981 and 1984. In 2015, Springsteen&#x27;s August 5, 1984, concert was officially released as a live album followed by his August 20, 1984 concert in 2018, his July 25, 1992 concert in 2019, and his July 9, 1981 concert in 2020. New Jersey natives Bon Jovi have played at the arena many times and sold out every show. The only other act to do that is Bruce Springsteen.

The Rolling Stones performed three consecutive shows, during their 1981 North American Tour, on November 5–7, 1981, with Tina Turner, George Thorogood &amp; The Destroyers and The J. Geils Band as their opening acts. The shows on November 5 and 6 were filmed and partially featured on their live-concert film, entitled &quot;Let&#x27;s Spend the Night Together&quot;. Queen performed in the arena on August 9, 1982, during their Hot Space Tour. This concert is infamous for Brian May &#x27;accidentally&#x27; snapping a replica of his Red Special after he hurled it to his wall of Vox AC30s and the roadies missed catching it. The replica was made by John Birch and was notably seen in the music videos of We Will Rock You and Spread Your Wings. 
Iron Maiden performed the first show on their The Beast on the Road Tour on October 22, 1982, and on their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour on March 14, 2008. Their performance of &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; was featured in the concert documentary &quot;Flight 666&quot;.The Grateful Dead played 16 times from 1983 through 1989, and recorded &quot;Road Trips Volume 4 Number 2&quot;, on March 31–April 1, 1988 and &quot;Nightfall of Diamonds&quot;, on October 16, 1989. Rush performed during their Power Windows Tour on March 31 and April 1, 1986. The shows were partially featured on their concert album, entitled &quot;A Show of Hands&quot;.

Pink Floyd performed three concerts on October 10, 11 and 12, 1987, as part of their A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour. Michael Jackson performed three sold-out shows during his Bad World Tour on October 3, 4 and 5, 1988, in front of 61,061 people. George Dalaras performed a sold-out concert at Meadowlands Arena on April 9, 1994. It is the biggest Greek concert ever held outside of Greece. It was a personal initiative of George Dalaras in order to support Cyprus and to promote the Cyprus problem. Among others, Al Di Meola had taken part in the concert. The Dave Matthews Band&#x27;s performance on September 11, 1999, was recorded for a PBS special and subsequently released as a live album and DVD, entitled &quot;Listener Supported&quot;.

Kiss performed on June 27, 2000, during their Kiss Farewell Tour, which was filmed and is available on their &quot;Kissology Volume Three: 1992–2000&quot; box set. Cher performed two shows during her, then, Farewell Tour on July 2, 2002, and April 13, 2005. On her DVD &quot;&quot;, there is a video of her rehearsing at the Izod Center. Phish performed a concert on February 24, 2003, which featured legendary blues guitarist B.B. King for most of the first set. Simon &amp; Garfunkel performed two consecutive shows during their Old Friends Reunion Tour, on December 7–8, 2003, with The Everly Brothers as their opening act. They performed &quot;Leaves That Are Green&quot; in place of &quot;Song for the Asking&quot;, which had been on their setlist for other concerts on this tour, following an announcement that they had not played it live since 1967.

The arena played host to the final show of the politically motivated Vote for Change Tour on October 13, 2004, featuring performances by Patti Scialfa, Jackson Browne and Bruce Springsteen &amp; E Street Band, with special guest John Fogerty and unannounced guest Eddie Vedder. Slipknot performed at the arena on March 6, 2005. The preshow of the concert was featured in a segment on the March 9, 2005, episode of &quot;Late Night With Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, where the Slipnutz, a comedy musical trio who were featured on Conan, opened for the band. However, the Slipnutz were heavily booed by the crowd.

The Red Hot Chili Peppers performed two consecutive shows during their Stadium Arcadium World Tour, on October 17 and 18, 2006, with The Mars Volta as their opening act. Footage from the shows and the arena were used in the music video for &quot;Snow (Hey Oh)&quot;. The Spice Girls performed during The Return of the Spice Girls Tour on February 13, 2008. Prince &amp; The New Power Generation kicked off their Welcome 2 American Tour, with two consecutive shows on December 15 and 17, 2010.

The &quot;Love for Levon&quot; concert took place on October 3, 2012, as a tribute to late drummer/singer Levon Helm of The Band. The show featured a wide variety of musicians who had worked with Helm, as well as musicians who were influenced by him. Proceeds from the show went towards keeping Helm&#x27;s Woodstock barn in his family&#x27;s control, as well as continuing his Midnight Ramble concert series in the barn. The show&#x27;s musical directors were Don Was and Levon Helm collaborator Larry Campbell. The concert was released on CD/DVD on March 19, 2013.

===Other events===
Fordham University&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team used the Izod Center as an alternate home court for four games in the 2010–11 season. The average attendance for these games was only 1,799, which was approximately half of the capacity of Fordham&#x27;s normal home, Rose Hill Gymnasium.

&quot;American Idol&quot; held auditions at the Izod Center on September 22, 2011. It also held auditions prior to this in 2006 for its sixth season.

Some scenes of the film &quot;Just Wright&quot; were filmed at the arena.

Several episodes of &quot;The Walking Dead: Dead City&quot; were filmed in the arena, doubling as Madison Square Garden.

<text>Jesús Manuel Marcano Trillo (born December 25, 1950), nicknamed &quot;Indio&quot;, is a Venezuelan former professional baseball second baseman, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland Athletics (–), Chicago Cubs (–, –), Philadelphia Phillies (–), Cleveland Indians (), Montreal Expos (), San Francisco Giants (–), and Cincinnati Reds (). A four-time All-Star, he was the Phillies&#x27; starting second baseman when the franchise won its first World Series Championship in 1980. He was known as one of the best fielding second basemen of his era, with a strong throwing arm.

==Major league career==
Signed as a catcher by the Philadelphia Phillies in , Trillo was converted into a third baseman by his first minor league manager, Dallas Green. In , he was selected by the Oakland Athletics from the Phillies in the Rule 5 draft. Trillo was converted into a second baseman in while playing for the Athletics&#x27; Triple A team, the Tucson Toros. He made his Major League debut at the age of 22 with Oakland on June 28, 1973 and stayed with the club as the Athletics won the American League Western Division pennant by six games over the Kansas City Royals.

Trillo was involved in a pair of controversies about his roster eligibility for the 1973 World Series. MLB strictly enforced a rule that only players on a major league roster on August 31 were eligible for the postseason. After José Morales&#x27; contract was sold to the Montreal Expos on September 18 and Bill North severely sprained an ankle, the A&#x27;s petitioned for and received approval from the Baltimore Orioles to allow the additions of both Trillo and Allan Lewis to its roster for the American League Championship Series. A&#x27;s owner Charlie Finley submitted the same request to the New York Mets, his team&#x27;s Fall Classic opponent which only approved Lewis but denied Trillo his eligibility. When Mike Andrews committed two errors in a four-run twelfth inning of Oakland&#x27;s Game 2 defeat, Finley attempted to have Andrews waived onto the disabled list in order to activate Trillo. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn ruled against Finley who was forced to reinstate Andrews for Game 4.

In April 1974, Trillo played 12 games for the Athletics before being sent back to the minor league Tucson Toros. He was eventually brought back to the major leagues in September. He appeared in one game of the 1974 American League Championship Series against the Baltimore Orioles, but didn&#x27;t make any further appearances as the Athletics defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1974 World Series.

On October 23, , Trillo was traded along with Darold Knowles and Bob Locker to the Chicago Cubs for Billy Williams. Trillo finished third in the National League Rookie of the Year Award balloting. With the Cubs, Trillo developed a reputation for being one of the best fielding second basemen in baseball, earning his first All-Star selection in 1977. Together with Cubs&#x27; shortstop Iván DeJesús, he formed one of the best double play combinations in baseball. He remained with the Cubs for four seasons before being traded to the Philadelphia Phillies on February 23, 1979, as part of an eight-player trade. Later that season, Trillo was reunited with his former minor league manager, Dallas Green, who had replaced Danny Ozark as the Phillies&#x27; manager. Trillo won his first Gold Glove Award in .

Trillo was an integral member of the world champion Phillies, adding solid defense, while hitting for over a .300 batting average until the middle of September, finishing the season with a career-high .292 average. He won the 1980 Silver Slugger Award for second basemen, which is awarded annually to the best offensive player at each position. In the 1980 National League Championship Series against the Houston Astros, he posted a .381 batting average with four runs batted in, and teamed up with Bake McBride in the decisive Game 5 to relay a throw to home plate, cutting off Luis Pujols attempting to score from first base on a double by Craig Reynolds. Trillo&#x27;s performance earned him the League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award.

In the 1980 World Series against the Kansas City Royals, Trillo once again made his mark in Game 5 by making another relay throw to cut off Darrell Porter trying to score in the sixth inning. He then hit a single with two outs in the ninth inning to drive home the winning run. The Phillies went on to win Game 6 and claimed the first world championship in the team&#x27;s history.

1981 was another good year for Trillo as he was selected as a reserve for the National League All-Star team, and won his second Gold Glove Award and his second consecutive Silver Slugger Award. He was voted to be the starting second baseman for the National League in the 1982 All-Star Game and set a since-broken major league record for consecutive errorless chances at second base (479), falling two games short of Joe Morgan&#x27;s record 91-game errorless streak.

Trillo was one of five Phillies along with George Vukovich, Julio Franco, Jerry Willard and Jay Baller who were traded to the Cleveland Indians for Von Hayes at the Winter Meetings on December 9, 1982. In 1983, he made his second consecutive start as the All-Star second baseman, this time for the American League. Trillo also won his third and final Gold Glove Award in . He finished the 1983 campaign with the Montreal Expos after being dealt from Cleveland for minor-league outfielder Don Carter and cash on August 17. Trillo had expressed a desire to return to the National League and demanded a five-year $4 million contract, the latter of which the Indians lacked the wherewithal to re-sign him. He was reacquired by the Cubs from the Giants for Dave Owen on December 11, 1985. His career as an active player ended with the Cincinnati Reds in 1989.

==Career statistics==
In a seventeen-year major league career, Trillo played in 1,780 games, accumulating 1,562 hits in 5,950 at bats for a .263 career batting average along with 61 home runs and 571 runs batted in. He ended his career with a .981 fielding percentage. A four-time All-Star, Trillo was a three-time Gold Glove winner and a two-time Silver Slugger Award winner. He led National League second basemen four times in assists, three times in range factor and twice in putouts.

In 2007, Trillo was inducted into the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.
In 1983, he was named to the Philadelphia Phillies Centennial Team as its second baseman. In 2020, he was selected for enshrinement on the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame.

<text>A mobile home (also known as a house trailer, park home, trailer, or trailer home) is a prefabricated structure, built in a factory on a permanently attached chassis before being transported to site (either by being towed or on a trailer). Used as permanent homes, or for holiday or temporary accommodation, they are often left permanently or semi-permanently in one place, but can be moved, and may be required to move from time to time for legal reasons.

Mobile homes share the same historic origins as travel trailers, but today the two are very different, with travel trailers being used primarily as temporary or vacation homes. Behind the cosmetic work fitted at installation to hide the base, mobile homes have strong trailer frames, axles, wheels, and tow-hitches.

== History ==
In the United States, this form of housing goes back to the early years of cars and motorized highway travel. It was derived from the travel trailer (often referred to during the early years as &quot;house trailers&quot; or &quot;trailer coaches&quot;), a small unit with wheels attached permanently, often used for camping or extended travel. 
The original rationale for this type of housing was its mobility. Units were initially marketed primarily to people whose lifestyle required mobility. However, in the 1950s, the homes began to be marketed primarily as an inexpensive form of housing designed to be set up and left in a location for long periods of time or even permanently installed with a masonry foundation. Previously, units had been eight feet or fewer in width, but in 1956, the wide home (&quot;ten-wide&quot;) was introduced, along with the new term &quot;mobile home&quot;.

The homes were given a rectangular shape, made from pre-painted aluminum panels, rather than the streamlined shape of travel trailers, which were usually painted after assembly. All of this helped increase the difference between these homes and home/travel trailers. The smaller, &quot;eight-wide&quot; units could be moved simply with a car, but the larger, wider units (&quot;ten-wide&quot;, and, later, &quot;twelve-wide&quot;) usually required the services of a professional trucking company, and, often, a special moving permit from a state highway department. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the homes were made even longer and wider, making the mobility of the units more difficult. Nowadays, when a factory-built home is moved to a location, it is usually kept there permanently and the mobility of the units has considerably decreased. In some states, mobile homes have been taxed as personal property if the wheels remain attached, but as real estate if the wheels are removed. Removal of the tongue and axles may also be a requirement for real estate classification.

===Manufactured home===

Mobile homes built in the United States since June 1976, legally referred to as manufactured homes, are required to meet FHA certification requirements and come with attached metal certification tags. Mobile homes permanently installed on owned land are rarely mortgageable, whereas FHA code manufactured homes are mortgageable through VA, FHA, and Fannie Mae.

Many people who could not afford a traditional site-built home, or did not desire to commit to spending a large sum of money on housing, began to see factory-built homes as a viable alternative for long-term housing needs. The units were often marketed as an alternative to apartment rental. However, the tendency of the units of this era to depreciate rapidly in resale value made using them as collateral for loans much riskier than traditional home loans. Terms were usually limited to less than the thirty-year term typical of the general home-loan market, and interest rates were considerably higher. In that way, mobile home loans resembled motor vehicle loans more than traditional home mortgage loans.

== Construction and sizes ==

Mobile homes come in two major sizes, &quot;single-wides&quot; and &quot;double-wides&quot;. Single-wides are or less in width and or less in length and can be towed to their site as a single unit. Double-wides are or more wide and are in length or less and are towed to their site in two separate units, which are then joined. &quot;Triple-wides&quot; and even homes with four, five, or more units are also built but less frequently.

While site-built homes are rarely moved, single-wide owners often &quot;trade&quot; or sell their home to a dealer in the form of the reduction of the purchase of a new home. These &quot;used&quot; homes are either re-sold to new owners or to park owners who use them as inexpensive rental units. Single-wides are more likely to be traded than double-wides because removing them from the site is easier. In fact, only about 5% of all double-wides will ever be moved.

While an EF1 tornado might cause minor damage to a site-built home, it could do significant damage to a factory-built home, especially an older model or one that is not properly secured. Also, structural components (such as windows) are typically weaker than those in site-built homes. winds can destroy a mobile home in a matter of minutes. Many brands offer optional hurricane straps, which can be used to tie the home to anchors embedded in the ground.

== Regulations ==

===United States===

In the United States, mobile homes are regulated by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), via the Federal National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. This national regulation has allowed many manufacturers to distribute nationwide because they are immune to the jurisdiction of local building authorities.

By contrast, producers of modular homes must abide by state and local building codes. There are, however, wind zones adopted by HUD that home builders must follow. For example, statewide, Florida is at least wind zone 2. South Florida is wind zone 3, the strongest wind zone. After Hurricane Andrew in 1992, new standards were adopted for home construction. The codes for building within these wind zones were significantly amended, which has greatly increased their durability. During the 2004 hurricanes in Florida, these standards were put to the test, with great success. Yet, older models continue to face the exposed risk to high winds because of the attachments applied such as carports, porch and screen room additions. Such areas are exposed to &quot;wind capture&quot; which apply extreme force to the underside of the integrated roof panel systems, ripping the fasteners through the roof pan causing a series of events which destroys the main roof system and the home.

The popularity of the factory-built homes caused complications the legal system was not prepared to handle. Originally, factory-built homes tended to be taxed as vehicles rather than real estate, which resulted in very low property tax rates for their inhabitants. That caused local governments to reclassify them for taxation purposes.

However, even with that change, rapid depreciation often resulted in the home occupants paying far less in property taxes than had been anticipated and budgeted. The ability to move many factory-built homes rapidly into a relatively small area resulted in strains to the infrastructure and governmental services of the affected areas, such as inadequate water pressure and sewage disposal, and highway congestion. That led jurisdictions to begin placing limitations on the size and density of developments.

Early homes, even those that were well-maintained, tended to depreciate over time, much like motor vehicles. That is in contrast to site-built homes which include the land they are built on and tend to appreciate in value. The arrival of mobile homes in an area tended to be regarded with alarm, in part because of the devaluation of the housing potentially spreading to preexisting structures.

This combination of factors has caused most jurisdictions to place zoning regulations on the areas in which factory-built homes are placed, and limitations on the number and density of homes permitted on any given site. Other restrictions, such as minimum size requirements, limitations on exterior colors and finishes, and foundation mandates have also been enacted. There are many jurisdictions that will not allow the placement of any additional factory-built homes. Others have strongly limited or forbidden all single-wide models, which tend to depreciate more rapidly than modern double-wide models.

Apart from all the practical issues described above, there is also the constant discussion about legal fixture and chattels and so the legal status of a trailer is or could be affected by its incorporation to the land or not. This sometimes involves such factors as whether or not the wheels have been removed.

====North Carolina====
The North Carolina Board of Transportation allowed 14-foot-wide homes on the state&#x27;s roads, but until January 1997, 16-foot-wide homes were not allowed. 41 states allowed 16-foot-wide homes, but they were not sold in North Carolina. Under a trial program approved January 10, 1997, the wider homes could be delivered on specific roads at certain times of day and travel 10 mph below the speed limit, with escort vehicles in front and behind. Eventually, all homes had to leave the state on interstate highways.

In December 1997, a study showed that the wider homes could be delivered safely, but some opponents still wanted the program to end. On December 2, 1999, the NC Manufactured Housing Institute asked the state Board of Transportation to expand the program to allow deliveries of 16-foot-wide homes within North Carolina. A month later, the board extended the pilot program by three months but did not vote to allow shipments within the state. In June 2000, the board voted to allow 16-foot-side homes to be shipped to other states on more two-lane roads, and to allow shipments in the state east of US 220. A third escort was required, including a law enforcement officer on two-lane roads.

====New York====
In New York State, the Homes and Community Renewal agency tracks mobile home parks and provides regulations concerning them. For example, the agency requires park owners to provide residents with a $15,000 grant if residents are forced to move when the land is transferred to a new owner. Residents are also granted the right of first refusal for a sale of the park, however, if the owner does not evict tenants for five years, the land sale can go ahead. State law also restricts the annual increase in land lot fee to a cap of 3 percent, unless the landowner demonstrates hardship in a local court, and can then raise the land lot fee by up to 6 percent in a year.

== Mobile home parks ==

Mobile homes are often sited in land lease communities known as trailer parks (also &#x27;trailer courts&#x27;, &#x27;mobile home parks&#x27;, &#x27;mobile home communities&#x27;, &#x27;manufactured home communities&#x27;, &#x27;factory-built home communities&#x27; etc.); these communities allow homeowners to rent space on which to place a home. In addition to providing space, the site often provides basic utilities such as water, sewer, electricity, or natural gas and other amenities such as mowing, garbage removal, community rooms, pools, and playgrounds.

There are over 38,000 trailer parks in the United States ranging in size from 5 to over 1,000 home sites. Although most parks appeal to meeting basic housing needs, some communities specialize towards certain segments of the market. One subset of mobile home parks, retirement communities, restrict residents to those age 55 and older. Another subset of mobile home parks, seasonal communities, are located in popular vacation destinations or are used as a location for summer homes. In New York State, as of 2019, there were 1,811 parks with 83,929 homes.

Newer homes, particularly double-wides, tend to be built to much higher standards than their predecessors and meet the building codes applicable to most areas. That has led to a reduction in the rate of value depreciation of most used units.

Additionally, modern homes tend to be built from materials similar to those used in site-built homes rather than inferior, lighter-weight materials. They are also more likely to physically resemble site-built homes. Often, the primary differentiation in appearance is that factory-built homes tend to have less of a roof slope so that they can be readily transported underneath bridges and overpasses.

The number of double-wide units sold exceeds the number of single-wides, which is due in part to the aforementioned zoning restrictions. Another reason for higher sales is the spaciousness of double-wide units, which are now comparable to site-built homes. Single-wide units are still popular primarily in rural areas, where there are fewer restrictions. They are frequently used as temporary housing in areas affected by natural disasters when restrictions are temporarily waived.

Another recent trend has been parks in which the owner of the mobile home owns the lot on which their unit is parked. Some of these communities simply provide land in a homogeneous neighborhood, but others are operated more like condominiums with club homes complete with swimming pools and meeting rooms which are shared by all of the residents, who are required to pay membership fees and dues.

== By country ==

Mobile home (or mobile-homes) are used in many European campgrounds to refer to fixed caravans, purpose-built cabins, and even large tents, which are rented by the week or even year-round as cheap accommodation, similar to the US concept of a trailer park. Like many other US loanwords, the term is not used widely in Britain.

=== United Kingdom ===
 Mobile Homes or Static Caravans are popular across the United Kingdom. They are more commonly referred to as Park Homes or Leisure Lodges, depending on if they are marketed as a residential dwelling or as a second holiday home residence.

Residential Mobile homes (park homes) are built to the BS3632 standard. This standard is issued by the British Standards Institute. The institute is a UK body who produce a range of standards for businesses and products to ensure they are fit for purpose. The majority of residential parks in the UK have a minimum age limit for their residents, and are generally marketed as retirement or semi-retirement parks. Holiday Homes, static caravans or holiday lodges aren&#x27;t required to be built to BS3632 standards, but many are built to the standard.
In addition to mobile homes, static caravans are popular across the UK. Static caravans have wheels and a rudimentary chassis with no suspension or brakes and are therefore transported on the back of large flatbed lorries, the axle and wheels being used for movement to the final location when the static caravan is moved by tractor or 4×4. A static caravan normally stays on a single plot for many years and has many of the modern conveniences normally found in a home.

Mobile homes are designed and constructed to be transportable by road in one or two sections. Mobile homes are no larger than with an internal maximum height of . Legally, mobile homes can still be defined as &quot;caravans&quot;.

Static holiday caravans generally have sleeping accommodation for 6 to 10 people in 2, 3 or 4 bedrooms and on convertible seating in the lounge referred to as a &#x27;pull out bed&#x27;. They tend towards a fairly &quot;open-plan&quot; layout, and while some units are double glazed and centrally heated for year-round use, cheaper models without double glazing or central heating are available for mainly summer use. Static caravan holiday homes are intended for leisure use and are available in widths, a small number in widths, and a few wide, consisting of two wide units joined. Generally, holiday homes are clad in painted steel panels, but can be clad in PVC, timber or composite materials. Static caravans are sited on caravan parks where the park operator of the site leases a plot to the caravan owner. There are many holiday parks in the UK in which one&#x27;s own static caravan can be owned. There are a few of these parks in areas that are prone to flooding and anyone considering buying a sited static caravan needs to take particular care in checking that their site is not liable to flooding.

Static caravans can be rented on an ad-hoc basis or purchased. Purchase prices range from £25,000 to £100,000. Once purchased, static caravans have various ongoing costs including insurance, site fees, local authority rates, utility charges, winterisation and depreciation. Depending on the type of caravan and the park these costs can range from £1,000 to £40,000 per year. Some park owners used to have unfair conditions in their lease contracts but the Office of Fair Trading has produced a guidance document available for download called Unfair Terms in Holiday Caravan Agreements which aims to stop unfair practices.

=== Israel ===
Many Israeli settlements and outposts are originally composed of caravans ( &quot;caravan&quot;; pl. קראוואנים, &quot;caravanim&quot;). They are constructed of light metal, are not insulated but can be outfitted with heating and air-conditioning units, water lines, recessed lighting, and floor tiling to function in a full-service capacity. Starting in 2005, prefabricated homes, named &quot;caravillas&quot; (), a portmanteau of the words caravan, and villa, begin to replace mobile homes in many Israeli settlements.

== Difference from modular homes ==
Because of similarities in the manufacturing process, some companies build both types in their factories. Modular homes are transported on flatbed trucks rather than being towed, and lack axles and an automotive-type frame. However, some modular homes are towed behind a semi-truck or toter on a frame similar to that of a trailer. The home is usually in two pieces and is hauled by two separate trucks. Each frame has five or more axles, depending on the size of the home. Once the home has reached its location, the axles and the tongue of the frame are then removed, and the home is set on a concrete foundation by a large crane.

Both styles are commonly referred to as factory-built housing, but that term&#x27;s technical use is restricted to a class of homes regulated by the Federal National Mfd. Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974.

Most zoning restrictions on the homes have been found to be inapplicable or only applicable to modular homes. That occurs often after considerable litigation on the topic by affected jurisdictions and by plaintiffs failing to ascertain the difference. Most modern modulars, once fully assembled, are indistinguishable from site-built homes. Their roofs are usually transported as separate units. Newer modulars also come with roofs that can be raised during the setting process with cranes. There are also modulars with 2 to 4 storeys.

<doc id="625018" wikidata="Q150584" url="?curid=625018" title="Anadenanthera peregrina">
<text>Anadenanthera peregrina, also known as yopo, jopo, cohoba, parica or calcium tree, is a perennial tree of the genus &quot;Anadenanthera&quot; native to the Caribbean and South America. It grows up to tall, and has a thorny bark. Its flowers grow in small, pale yellow to white spherical clusters resembling Acacia (e.g. wattle) inflorescences. It is an entheogen which has been used in healing ceremonies and rituals for thousands of years in northern South America and the Caribbean. Although the seeds of the yopo tree were originally gathered from the wild, increased competition between tribes over access to the seeds led to it being intentionally cultivated and transported elsewhere, expanding the plant&#x27;s distribution through introduction to areas beyond its native range.

This plant is almost identical to that of a related tree, &quot;Anadenanthera colubrina&quot;, commonly known as cebíl or vilca. The beans of &quot;A. colubrina&quot; have a similar chemical makeup as &quot;Anadenanthera peregrina&quot;, with their primary constituent being bufotenin.

==Botanical varieties==
* &quot;Anadenanthera peregrina&quot; var. &quot;falcata&quot;
* &quot;Anadenanthera peregrina&quot; var. &quot;peregrina&quot;

==Uses==

===Wood===
The wood from &quot;A. peregrina&quot; produces very hard timber that is used for making furniture. It has a Janka rating of 3700 lb. and a density of around 0.86 g/cm3. Tannins have also been derived from this plant.

===Toxicity===
The beans (sometimes called seeds) and falling leaves are hallucinogenic and are toxic to cattle.[1]

==Chemical compounds==
Chemical compounds contained in &quot;A. peregrina&quot; include:
* 2,9-dimethyltryptoline – plant
* 2-methyltryptoline – plant
* 5-MeO-DMT – bark, bean
* 5-Methoxy-&quot;N&quot;-methyltryptamine – bark
* Bufotenin – plant beans
* Bufotenin-oxide – fruit, beans
* Catechol – plant
* Leucoanthocyanin – plant
* Leucopelargonidol – plant
* DMT – fruit, beans, pods, bark
* DMT-oxide – fruit
* N-Methyltryptamine – bark
* Orientin – leaf
* Saponarentin – leaf
* Viterine – leaf

The bark contains a high percentage of tannins, 587 mg CE/g extract.

==Entheogenic uses==
===Traditional usage===

Archaeological evidence shows &quot;Anadenanthera&quot; beans have been used as hallucinogens for thousands of years. The oldest clear evidence of use comes from pipes made of puma bone (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;) found with &quot;Anadenanthera&quot; beans presumably of the sister species &quot;A. colubrina&quot;, at Inca Cueva, a site in the Humahuaca gorge at the edge of the Puna of Jujuy Province, Argentina. The pipes were found to contain the hallucinogen DMT, one of the compounds found in &quot;Anadenanthera&quot; beans. Radiocarbon testing of the material gave a date of 2130 BC, suggesting that &quot;Anadenanthera&quot; use as a hallucinogen is over 4,000 years old. Snuff trays and tubes similar to those commonly used for yopo were found in the central Peruvian coast dating back to 1200 BC, suggesting that insufflation of &quot;Anadenanthera&quot; beans is a more recent method of use. Archaeological evidence of insufflation use within the period 500-1000 AD, in northern Chile, has been reported.

Some indigenous peoples of the Orinoco basin in Colombia, Venezuela and possibly in the southern part of the Brazilian Amazon make use of yopo snuff for spiritual healing. Yopo snuff was also widely used in ceremonial contexts in the Caribbean area, including Puerto Rico and La Española, up to the Spanish Conquest.

Yopo snuff is usually blown into the user&#x27;s nostrils by another person through bamboo tubes or sometimes snuffed by the user using bird bone tubes. Blowing is more effective as this method allows more powder to enter the nose and is said to be less irritating. In some areas the unprocessed ground beans are snuffed or smoked producing a much weaker effect with stronger physical symptoms. Some tribes use yopo along with &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot; to increase and prolong the visionary effects, creating an experience similar to that of ayahuasca.

=== Effects ===

The first report of the effects of hallucinogenic snuff prepared from the beans of &quot;Anadenanthera peregrina&quot; dates back to 1496 when it was observed by Friar Ramon Pane, who was commissioned by Christopher Columbus, among the Taino Indians of Hispaniola. Pane&#x27;s report was first published in 1511 in Martyr&#x27;s descriptions of the New World. The description of its effects reads in part: &quot;This &quot;kohobba&quot; powder,&quot; described as &quot;an intoxicating herb, is so strong that those who take it lose consciousness; when the stupefying action begins to wane, the arms and legs become loose and the head droops.&quot; It is administered with a cane about one foot long of which they introduce one end &quot;in the nose and the other in the powder and ...draw it into themselves through the nose&quot;. It worked quickly: &quot;almost immediately they believe they see the room turn upside-down and men walking with their heads downwards&quot;. The administering witch-doctor took the drug along with his patients, intoxicating &quot;them so that they do not know what they do and ... speak of many things incoherently&quot;, believing that they are in communication with spirits.

===Active constituents===
====Bufotenin====
The beans have been found to contain up to 7.4% bufotenin. At up to 7.4% (74 mg per gram) bufotenin, an effective 40 mg dose of insufflated bufotenin requires little more than 0.5 grams of beans.

The intraperitoneal of bufotenin is between 200 and 300 mg/kg (in rodents) with death occurring by respiratory arrest. Human intravenous tests using bufotenin suggest the LD50 may be much lower in humans with subjects showing signs of peripheral toxicity (purple face, tachycardia, difficulty breathing, etc.) at doses as little as 8 mg in some subjects. Free base bufotenin when insufflated, taken sublingually, orally, or intrarectally, elicits strong hallucinogenic effects with far less side effects.

====Dimethyltryptamine and 5-MeO-DMT====
The beans have been found to contain up to only 0.04% 5-MeO-DMT and 0.16% DMT. The leaves and bark also contain small amounts of DMT, 5-MeO-DMT and related compounds.

At up to 0.04% (0.4 mg per gram) 5-MeO-DMT, an effective light 5 mg dose of insufflated 5-MeO-DMT would require over 12 grams of beans. It would be extremely difficult to insufflate such a quantity, as tolerance would likely develop before the 12-gram nasal intake could be completed. Individual sensitivity to 5-MeO-DMT varies. It has been documented that the threshold dose in some individuals is as much as 10 mg insufflated requiring over 24 grams of beans for an effective dose of 5-MeO-DMT.

At up to 0.16% (1.6 mg per gram) DMT, an effective 40 mg dose of insufflated DMT would require 25 grams or more. Because of its volume, it&#x27;s likely to be impossible to insufflate the 25 grams of beans required to reach the active dose of DMT present in the beans. An extract of 25 grams of beans could contain up to 1,850 mg of bufotenin, a potentially dangerous dose. With insufflated freebase bufotenin, the maximum published safe dose used has been 100 mg.

Unlike bufotenin, both DMT and 5-MeO-DMT are relatively unstable and begin to degrade rather quickly. Schultes and colleges (1977) examined a 120-year-old bean collection and found 0.6% bufotenin with no DMT or 5-MeO-DMT present at all. They also examined a batch of beans that contained all three compounds when fresh, but found only bufotenin in the beans after only two years of storage.

===Oral usage===
When taken orally by some tribes in South America, small amounts are often combined with alcoholic &quot;chichas&quot; (maize beer). Moderate doses are unpleasant, producing nausea and vomiting. The beans were a main ingredient in bilca tauri, an oral purge medicine used to induce ritual vomiting once a month. Large amounts are not usually consumed orally as many tribes believe oral use is dangerous.

===Use with MAOIs===
Some South American tribes have been documented to use various bean preparations along with &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot;, an herb containing monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Typically &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot; is chewed in the mouth while the Anadenanthera beans are snuffed or smoked. Occasionally &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot; is found mixed in with the snuff.

<text>Auxenochlorella pyrenoidosa, formerly Chlorella pyrenoidosa, is a species of the freshwater green alga in the Division Chlorophyta. It occurs worldwide. The species name &quot;pyrenoidosa&quot; refers to the presence of a prominent pyrenoid within the &quot;Chlorella&quot; chloroplast.

== Uses ==
&quot;Auxenochlorella pyrenoidosa&quot; has been used medicinally as a chelatory agent, for example to extract dioxins and dioxin-like compounds from the body.

Possible medicinal uses include:
* fibromyalgia
* hypertension
* ulcerative colitis

The &quot;pyrenoidosa&quot; species have been used in traditional Chinese medicine.

Boraas (1983) reported a mutation in a population of Chlorella pyrenoidosa kept in his lab as a food stock for a population of flagellates. Due to a malfunction of his equipment some of the flagellates got in the Chlorella&#x27;s tank. This caused a mutation from unicellular to multicellular.

For early work in this area, a science project by David and John Watkins at Fairborn High School tested use of chlorella pyrenoidosa to support generation of oxygen for use in space missions. This was reported in the January 31, 1959 edition of the Fairborn Daily Herald and the project went on to win a top ranking at the Ohio State science fair in Columbus Ohio that year. The brothers were 14 and 13 years old at the time and based part of their work on information from the Kettering Foundation.

This algae was used in a 1961 study by Boeing to see about feasibility for the use of algae providing oxygen on space missions.

<doc id="625026" wikidata="Q17126688" url="?curid=625026" title="ITU Region">
<text>The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in its International Radio Regulations, divides the world into three ITU regions for the purposes of managing the global radio spectrum. Each region has its own set of frequency allocations, the main reason for defining the regions.

==Boundaries==
*Region 1 comprises Europe, Africa, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Mongolia, and the Middle East west of the Persian Gulf, including Iraq.
** The western boundary is defined by Line B and the eastern boundary is defined by Line A, except that all territory of Iran is excluded, and all territory of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Turkey and Ukraine and the area to the north of Russia which lies between lines A and C is included.
*Region 2 covers the Americas including Greenland, and some of the eastern Pacific Islands.
** The eastern boundary is defined by Line B and the western boundary is defined by Line C.
*Region 3 contains most of non-FSU Asia east of and including Iran, and most of Oceania.
** The western boundary is defined by Line A and the eastern boundary is defined by Line C.

Lines:
* Line A is a line running from the North Pole along meridian 40° East of Greenwich to parallel 40° North; thence by great circle arc to the intersection of meridian 60° East and the Tropic of Cancer; thence along the meridian 60° East to the South Pole.
* Line B is a line running from the North Pole along meridian 10° West of Greenwich to its intersection with parallel 72° North; thence by great circle arc to the intersection of meridian 50° West and parallel 40° North; thence by great circle arc to the intersection of meridian 20° West and parallel 10° South; thence along meridian 20° West to the South Pole.
* Line C is a line running from the North Pole by great circle arc to the intersection of parallel 65° 30` North with the international boundary in the Bering Strait; thence by great circle arc to the intersection of meridian 165° East of Greenwich and parallel 50° North; thence by great circle arc to the intersection of meridian 170° West and parallel 10° North; thence along parallel 10° North to its intersection with meridian 120° West; thence along meridian 120° West to the South Pole.

==Usage==
The definition of the European Broadcasting Area uses some of the definitions of Region 1.

==ITU Zones==
For convenience the regions are further divided into a total of 90 zones. While often following political boundaries, in more remote land and sea areas these are often defined to be roughly equal in size and so can have very low populations. As examples, Antarctica is divided into seven zones, and in one Pacific Ocean zone the only land area is tiny Minami Torishima. For certain awards and contests amateur radio operators may attempt to contact as many zones as possible.

<text>Probatio diabolica (Latin for &quot;devil&#x27;s proof&quot; or &quot;diabolical proof&quot;) is a legal requirement to achieve an impossible proof. Where a legal system would appear to require an impossible proof, the remedies are reversing the burden of proof, or giving additional rights to the individual facing the &quot;probatio diabolica&quot;.

The devil&#x27;s proof is the logical dilemma that while evidence will prove the existence of something, the lack of evidence fails to disprove it. In essence, the opposing statement&#x27;s lack of proof makes the statement true in some sense. This connects with the idea that, while substantial evidence may prove the devil&#x27;s existence, there is no evidence that denies the devil&#x27;s existence; therefore, one cannot deny the devil&#x27;s existence.

For example, one party might patent a process for manufacturing an item while another party might then make the item. The patent-holder would normally have to show that the patented process had been improperly used; this is a &quot;probatio diabolica&quot;, since, on the face of it, the patent-holder cannot prove which process was actually used, which could render the patent useless. Two possible solutions exist:
*the burden of proof is reversed by presuming that the second manufacturer has improperly used the patented process, unless they demonstrate that they used some other process; or
*the patent-holder is given discovery rights, enabling them to obtain information from the second manufacturer on the process actually used.

<text>Inga Grigoryevna Artamonova (; 29 August 1936 – 4 January 1966) was a Soviet speed skater, the first four-time Allround World Champion in women&#x27;s speed skating history. After her marriage in 1959 to fellow speed skater Gennady Voronin (), she was also known as Inga Voronina ().

At the age of twelve, Inga Artamonova began rowing, becoming Master of Sports of the USSR and winning in the USSR Junior Championships. Later, she began speed skating. Skating for Dynamo in Moscow, Artamonova won the World Allround Speed Skating Championships in 1957, 1958, and 1962, and was second in 1963 and 1964 before capturing her fourth World Championships title in 1965. She also was five times Soviet Allround Champion and 26 times Soviet Champion in individual distances. Over the course of her career, Artamonova set of a number of world records, including four in two days in 1962 when she set new marks on the 500 m, 1,500 m, and 3,000 m, which also resulted in a new world record on the &quot;mini combination&quot; (500 m – 1,000 m – 1,500 m – 3,000 m; the distances then in use at the World Allround Championships for women). She was also eight times winner of the prestigious Kirov Prize, winning all editions between 1958 and 1965.

Her husband Gennady Voronin, who could not deal with all Artamonova&#x27;s successes, had by this time become an alcoholic and seen his own speed skating career vanish. Murdered by Gennady at the age of 29, Artamonova was interred in the Vagankovskoye Cemetery in Moscow. She is the author of the book &quot;I Am Learning to Go on the Ground&quot; (), which was published after her death, in 1967.

<doc id="625036" wikidata="Q937332" url="?curid=625036" title="Battle of Kircholm">
<text>The Battle of Kircholm (; Polish: &quot;Bitwa pod Kircholmem&quot;; Swedish: &quot;Slaget vid Kirkholm&quot;; ) was one of the major battles in the Polish–Swedish War of 1600–1611. The battle was decided in 20 minutes by a devastating charge of Polish-Lithuanian cavalry, including the Winged Hussars. The battle ended in a decisive victory of the Polish-Lithuanian forces, and is remembered as one of the greatest triumphs of Commonwealth cavalry.

== Background ==
On 27 September 1605, the Commonwealth and Swedish forces met near the small town of Kircholm (now Salaspils in Latvia, some south-east of Riga). The forces of Charles IX of Sweden were numerically superior and were composed of 10,868 men and 11 cannons. The Swedish army included two western commanders, Frederick of Lüneburg and Count Joachim Frederick of Mansfeld, with a few thousand German and Dutch mercenaries and even a few hundred Scots.

The Polish Crown declined to raise funds for defence and send troops, only making promises they never fulfilled. The army, led by the Great Hetman of Lithuania Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, was tired and starving; however, the soldiers admired their leader. He promised to pay army wages from his own fortune, resulting in an influx of recruits from Lithuania. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth army under Chodkiewicz was composed of roughly 1,000 infantry and 2,600 cavalry, but only five cannons. However, the Polish-Lithuanian forces were well-rested, and their cavalry consisted mostly of superbly trained Winged Hussars, or heavy cavalry armed with lances. In contrast, the Swedish cavalry were less-well trained, armed with pistols and carbines, on poorer horses and tired after a long night&#x27;s march of over 10 km in torrential rain. The Polish-Lithuanian forces had a small number of Lithuanian Tatar and Cossack mercenaries, used mostly for reconnaissance.

== Deployment ==

The Swedish forces seem to have been deployed in a checkerboard formation, made up of the infantry regiments formed into seven or eight well-spaced independent blocks, with intersecting fields of fire. The flanks were to be covered by the Swedish and German cavalry, and the cannons were placed in front of the cavalry. Charles&#x27; force was formed into four lines on the crest of a ridge. The first line consisted of four infantry battalions, cavalry in the second line, six infantry battalions in the third line, and cavalry in the fourth line. The infantry battalions formed in squares of 30 by 30, with pikemen in the center and shot on the edges, and gaps between the squares allowed passage of their cavalry.

Jan Karol Chodkiewicz deployed his forces in the traditional deep Polish battle formation—the so-called &quot;Old Polish Order&quot;—with the left wing significantly stronger and commanded by Tomasz Dąbrowa, while the right wing was composed of a smaller number of hussars under Jan Piotr Sapieha, and the center included Hetman Chodkiewicz&#x27;s own company of 300 hussars led by Lt. Wincenty Woyna and a powerful formation of reiters sent by the Duke of Courland Friedrich Kettler. The Polish-Lithuanian infantry, mostly armed in Hungarian hajduk-style, drew up in the center. Some 280 hussars were left as a general reserve under Teodor Lacki.

== Battle ==

Chodkiewicz tried for hours to lure the Swedes from their positions with his light cavalry sent out to skirmish between the two armies. Chodkiewicz, having smaller forces (approximately a 1:3 disadvantage), used a feint to lure the Swedes off their high position, pretending to withdraw. The Swedes under Charles thought that the Polish-Lithuanian troops were retreating and therefore advanced to the bottom of the slope, using their second line of cavalry to cover their flanks while the first line of infantry closed up. This is what Chodkiewicz was waiting for. The Commonwealth forces now gave fire with Kettlers&#x27; Curonian harquebusiers while Wincenty Wojna&#x27;s hussars charged at the Swedish lines, causing disorder in the infantry.

The main battle started with the Polish-Lithuanian cavalry charge on the Swedish right flank, with about 1,000 hussars shattering Mansfield&#x27;s reiters and disordering the Swedish third infantry line in their retreat. At the same time, on the Swedish left, 650 hussars under Sapieha charged. After Charles sent in his reserve of 700 cavalry, Chodkiewicz sent in his reserves. The entire force of Swedish cavalry was finally put to rout, and in their flight, disordered many of their own infantry, leaving them vulnerable to the hussars&#x27; charge.

Within 30 minutes, the Swedish cavalry was in full retreat on both flanks exposing the infantry in the centre to the hussars and the firepower of Chodkiewicz&#x27;s infantry. The Swedish defeat was utter and complete. The army of Charles IX had lost at least 5,000 killed and 500 captured, or up to 7,600–8,000 killed, captured, and dispersed. The Polish-Lithuanian losses numbered only about 100 dead and 200 wounded, although the hussars, in particular, lost a large part of their trained battle horses.

As in all crushing victories in this period, the larger part of the Swedish losses were suffered during the retreat, made more difficult by the dense forests and marshes on the route back to Riga, many drowning crossing the Dvina. The Poles and Lithuanians spared few. Polish-Lithuanian casualties were light, in large part due to the speed of the victory. During the hussar&#x27;s charges, it was the horses that took the greatest damage, the riders being largely protected by the body and heads of their horses.

== Aftermath ==

After the defeat, the Swedish king was forced to abandon the siege of Riga and withdraw by ship back across the Baltic Sea to Sweden, and to relinquish control of northern Latvia and Estonia. However, the Commonwealth proved unable to exploit the victory fully because there was no money for the troops, who had not been paid for months. Without pay, they could not buy food or fodder for their horses or replenish their military supplies, and so the campaign faltered. An additional factor was the large number of trained horses lost during the battle, which proved difficult to replace.

A truce was eventually signed in 1611, but by 1617 war broke out again, and finally, in 1621, the new Swedish king, Gustavus Adolphus, landed near Riga and took the city with a brief siege, wiping away – in Swedish eyes – much of the shame suffered at Kircholm.

== Commemoration ==
The Battle of Kircholm is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription &quot;KIRCHOLM 27 IX 1605&quot;.

<doc id="625041" wikidata="Q231151" url="?curid=625041" title="Tindouf Province">
<text>Tindouf, also written Tinduf (), is the westernmost province of Algeria, having a population of 58,193 as of the 2008 census (not including the Sahrawi refugees at the Sahrawi refugee camps). Its population in reality could be as high as 160,000 because of the Sahrawi refugee camps. Despite the barren landscape, Tindouf is a resource-rich province, with important quantities of iron ore located in the Gara Djebilet area close to the border with Mauritania. Prior to Algerian independence, the area served as a strongpoint of several tribes of the nomadic Reguibat confederation.

==History==

During the Zayyanid period, the Draa region which surrounds the Tindouf province was governed by a sheikh of the Zayyanids.

The town of Tindouf was rebuilt near an isolated Saharan oasis in 1852 by members of the Tajakant tribe, but sacked and destroyed by the Reguibat tribe in 1895. It remained deserted until French troops led by colonel Trinquet arrived in the area in 1934 and attached the region to the French Algeria territory.

The province houses army and airforce bases for the Algerian military, and is strategically important due to its proximity to the Moroccan border, and its location at a four-country border crossing. From independence in 1956, the Kingdom of Morocco claimed the Tindouf area and western Algeria as part of Morocco. These claims are based on the allegations that until 1952, Tindouf was part of French Morocco and was administratively attached to Agadir, and promises made by parts of the Algerian underground during that country&#x27;s war for independence. After Algeria&#x27;s independence in 1962, Morocco&#x27;s claim to Tindouf was not accepted by the new Algerian republic. This led to the 1963 Sand war, fought along the Moroccan-Algerian border in the Tindouf region, and also involving Béchar Province and Tlemcen Province, after Morocco claimed the area as its own following Algerian independence.

In a process beginning in 1969 and finalized during the OAU summit in Rabat in 1972, Morocco recognized the border with Algeria, in exchange for joint exploitation of the iron ore in Tindouf. However, parts of Moroccan society and some nationalist political parties still refer to the Tindouf area as historically Moroccan territory, and the Moroccan parliament has still not ratified the border recognition.

From 1974, refugees from the contested Spanish Sahara started arriving to the Tindouf area, following an earlier wave from the 1958 unrest. This turned into a major exodus from 1975 onwards, when Morocco and Mauritania seized control of what was then called Western Sahara, and Algeria retaliated by allowing the Polisario Front, a nationalist Sahrawi movement, to use the area as its main base. Sahrawi refugee camps were established in Tindouf in 1975-6, such as Smara refugee camp and El Aaiun refugee camp. The Polisario remains in the province, running the large refugee camps located south of Tindouf city.

The European Commission refers to the Sahrawi refugees as the &quot;forgotten refugees&quot;.

The province was created from Béchar Province in 1984.

==Administrative divisions==

The province contains one &quot;daïra&quot; (district), Tindouf, which is coextensive with the province. The province and daïra has a population of 58,193 inhabitants. The daira is further divided into two &quot;communes&quot; or municipalities: Tindouf and Oum El Assel. It is one of only 3 provinces in the country which has only one &quot;daïra&quot; and along with Bordj Baji Mokhtar Province, Djanet Province, In Guezzam Province also has the fewest communes with just 2.

<doc id="625042" wikidata="Q44121" url="?curid=625042" title="Lobo (DC Comics)">
<text>Lobo is a fictional character appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. He was created by Roger Slifer and Keith Giffen, and first appeared in &quot;Omega Men&quot; #3 (June 1983). He is an alien from the utopian planet of Czarnia, and works as an interstellar mercenary and bounty hunter.

Lobo was first introduced as a hardened villain in the 1980s, but he soon fell out of use with writers. He remained in limbo until his revival as a bounty hunter with his own comic in the early 1990s.

One of the key factors in this revival was the distinct and influential artwork of Simon Bisley, whose exaggerated and dynamic style helped redefine the character and significantly contributed to his popularity. Bisley&#x27;s work on the Lobo series, starting with the miniseries &quot;Lobo: The Last Czarnian&quot; in 1990, was instrumental in cementing Lobo&#x27;s place in the 1990s American comic book scene.

Writers attempted to use Lobo as a parody of the 1990s trend towards &quot;grim and gritty&quot; superhero stories, but he was instead enthusiastically accepted by fans of the trend. This popularity led to the character having a much higher profile in DC Comics stories from then on, as well as starring roles in various series in the decades since.

Lobo has been substantially adapted into media outside comics. Brad Garrett, David Sobolov, John DiMaggio, and Fred Tatasciore, among others, have voiced the character in animation and video games. Lobo made his live-action debut in &quot;Krypton&quot; (2018–2019), portrayed by Emmett J. Scanlan, and will make his cinematic debut in the DC Universe film &quot;&quot; (2026), portrayed by Jason Momoa.

==Character development==
The character had a short run as one of DC&#x27;s most popular characters throughout the 1990s. This version of Lobo was intended to be a satire of the Marvel Comics superhero Wolverine. In issue #41 of &quot;Deadpool&quot;, a separate Marvel series, Lobo was parodied as &quot;Dirty Wolff&quot;, a large blue-skinned man who drove a demonic motorcycle. He was also parodied in the Image Comics series &quot;Bloodwulf&quot; and as &quot;Bolo&quot; in the Topps Comics series &quot;Satan&#x27;s Six&quot;.

Simon Bisley&#x27;s biker lifestyle played a significant role in shaping Lobo&#x27;s redesign, infusing the character with a rugged, rebellious aesthetic that resonated with fans.

In a 2006 interview, Keith Giffen said: &quot;I have no idea why Lobo took off... I came up with him as an indictment of the Punisher, Wolverine hero prototype, and somehow he caught on as the high violence poster boy. Go figure&quot;. He later stated that both Lobo and Ambush Bug were derived from Lunatik, a character he created in high school.

Lobo was the favorite DC Comics character of Stan Lee.

==Publication history==
Lobo was introduced as a regular character in Keith Giffen and Roger Slifer&#x27;s &quot;Green Lantern&quot; and &quot;Teen Titans&quot; spin-off &quot;The Omega Men&quot;. At that time, he was a Velorpian whose entire race had been exterminated by Psions and was partnered with Bedlam, whom he later killed; his origin was later retconned.

After a well-received appearance in &quot;Justice League International&quot;, Lobo became a regular character in &quot;L.E.G.I.O.N.&quot; and its successor series &quot;R.E.B.E.L.S.&quot;.

In 1990, he appeared in his own four-issue miniseries, &quot;Lobo: The Last Czarnian&quot;, plotted by Giffen, written by Alan Grant and with art by Simon Bisley, which changed his origin story: he became the last Czarnian after violently killing every other member of the species. That mini-series led to many subsequent miniseries and specials, including &quot;Lobocop&quot;, a RoboCop parody; &quot;Blazing Chain of Love&quot;, in which he is sent on a job to a harem; &quot;Paramilitary Christmas Special&quot;, in which he is contracted by the Easter Bunny to assassinate Santa Claus; &quot;Infanticide&quot;, where he kills his daughter and all of his other offspring that she has gathered to try to kill him; &quot;Convention Special&quot;, a send-up of comic book conventions; and &quot;Unamerican Gladiators&quot;, in which Lobo takes part in a deadly televised game show. Simon Bisley&#x27;s dark humor fits well within the pages of his artwork by having countless mutilations of background characters occurring in each panel. Lobo also starred in his own DC title for 64 issues, from 1993 to 1999.

Lobo has regularly made guest appearances in other series, even in cross-company interactions with such non-DC characters as the Mask, Judge Dredd, and the Authority. During the &quot;DC vs. Marvel&quot; crossover series, he fought Wolverine and lost due to popular vote by the fans. He also appeared very briefly in the &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot; inter-company crossover and is shown fighting members of the Shi&#x27;ar Imperial Guard; although the outcome is not shown, it is mentioned that the Guard had trouble containing him.

==Fictional character biography==
Lobo is a Czarnian with exceptional strength and fortitude. He enjoys nothing better than mindless violence and intoxication, and killing as an end in itself; his name roughly translates as &quot;he who devours your entrails and thoroughly enjoys it&quot;. He is arrogant and self-centered, focusing almost solely on his own pleasures, although he proudly lives up to the letter of his promises – but always no more or no less than what he promised. Lobo is the last of his kind, having killed most of his species with a scorpion-like creature. It is later revealed that some Czarnians survived: Lobo&#x27;s teacher and former military officer Miss Tribb, and the population of a city that Brainiac stole centuries prior.
Physically, Lobo resembles a chalk-white human male with, generally, blood-red pupilless eyes with blackened eyelids. Like many comic book characters, Lobo&#x27;s body is highly muscular, though his initial appearances were thinner compared to later iterations. Originally portrayed with neatly trimmed purple-grey hair, this was soon redesigned as a gray mane, later a long, straggly, gray-black rocker hair, dreadlocks, and more recently a pompadour. Similarly, the orange-and-purple leotard he wore in his first few appearances was replaced by black leather biker gear and was later replaced with both the robes of his office as a putative Archbishop and pirate-themed gear, then later a sleeveless flight suit/jumpsuit. His arsenal includes numerous guns and a titanium chain with a hook on his right arm. Extra weapons may include &quot;frag grenades&quot; and giant carving blades.

Lobo has a strict personal code of honor in that he will never violate the letter of an agreement, though he may gleefully disregard its spirit. He is surprisingly protective of space dolphins, some of which he feeds from his home. A few have been killed in separate incidents, which he avenges with his usual violence.

Lobo&#x27;s friends include Dawg, a bulldog that he often claims is not his when it gets into trouble; Jonas Glim, a fellow bounty hunter; Ramona, a bail bondswoman/hairdresser; and Green Lantern Guy Gardner.

Dawg is stomped to death by Lobo in &quot;Lobo&quot; (vol. 2) #58, in which he again claims to Superman that the dog is not his; this is for the final time. Somehow, Dawg later appears alongside Lobo when Lobo goes to Earth to fight Green Lantern and Atrocitus. His enemies include the do-gooder superhero parody Goldstar, Loo, Vril Dox, Bludhound, Etrigan the Demon, and General Glory. Lobo generally tries to kill anyone he is hired to capture, including his fourth-grade teacher Miss Tribb, his children, Santa Claus, and Dawg, although his main targets are Superman and Deathstroke. Lobo frequents a restaurant, Al&#x27;s Diner, where he often flirts with Al&#x27;s only waitress, Darlene Spritzer. Though Lobo protects these two from frequent danger, he does not seem to understand the distress caused by his tendency to destroy the diner. Al and Darlene later prosper due to Lobo&#x27;s appetite for destruction; he destroys the city, except for the diner, leaving hordes of construction workers with only one place to eat lunch. He also ends up destroying a diner Al gives to him as part of a birthday celebration.

The last revelation of Lobo and the diner appears to be in the pages of &quot;Lobo&quot; (vol. 2) #1,000,000 (November 1998), where his last adventure is depicted. By the time of the action, he is already obese and working as a carnival attraction, scaring tourists into leaving their money behind. Then, a sexy client appears to offer him one last job: finding legendary evildoer Malo Perverso. At the prospect of a last well-paid job and a chance to score with the client, Lobo quickly agrees, and he again invades the diner to use their Tesseract teleporter to reach his gear. It is revealed then the &quot;client&quot; is none other than Darlene, who wanted to see him in his prime rather than see him sink into sloth.

After reaching his gear, Lobo invades the HQ of the International Justice Legion Wanna-Bes and crushes all opposition to hack their files on Malo Perverso. There, he is attacked by Perverso, who then reveals himself to be Clayman. Clayman also squeals that the real Perverso went into a black hole. Lobo, still eager to find his bounty, goes into the black hole. Ironically, due to Lobo&#x27;s interference in a planetary conflict in the same issue, Al later gets a package through the Tesseract for Lobo – which promptly blows the diner up yet again.

At one point, Lobo has trouble with a clone of himself that had survived previous misadventures. A battle between the two makes it unclear which of them survived.

Lobo has participated in several money-making schemes, such as being a priest and a pop-rock idol. Most of these schemes tend to end with the violent deaths of nearly everyone involved. He has many friends among the bounty hunter world, though many tend to die when they are around Lobo, either by his hand or at the hands of the enemies he faces.

=== Crossovers ===
Lobo has both clashed and cooperated with Superman. He has also encountered Batman a couple of times, although one of these encounters was in an &quot;Elseworlds&quot; continuity. He has both fought and teamed up with Guy Gardner more than once, helping him to destroy various alien threats to Earth. Lobo often visits Warriors, Guy&#x27;s bar, where he enjoys free drinks.

He fights Aquaman when a traveling space dolphin visiting Earth is killed by Japanese fishermen. He ceases fighting when he learns Aquaman is not only a friend to dolphins, but was raised by them. Although Lobo feels he cannot hurt a fellow dolphin lover, he has no such mercy for the fishermen.

Lobo also has appeared with the Authority. In one such appearance, Jenny Quantum finds a comic book detailing Lobo&#x27;s murder of Santa Claus; she experiences a fit of rage and confusion. She breaks the barrier between her dimension and the dimension Lobo inhabits in the comic book, and Lobo finds himself in a fight with the Authority.

Lobo has also had run-ins with Hitman, Valor, Starman, the Ray, Deadman, Green Lantern, the JLA, StormWatch, Mister Miracle, the Legion of Super-Heroes, Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman, Doctor Fate, the Sovereign Seven, Supergirl, and Superboy, among others.

===&quot;L.E.G.I.O.N.&quot;/&quot;R.E.B.E.L.S.&quot;===

Lobo acts as an independent bounty hunter until tricked by Vril Dox into nominally joining his interstellar police force, &quot;L.E.G.I.O.N.&quot; However, he continues solo activity, which seems to often bring him to Earth and in conflict with its heroes. Or, as in one case, base indifference. He remains loyal to Vril Dox after L.E.G.I.O.N. leadership is usurped by Dox&#x27;s son, until an altercation between Lobo and Dox prompts Dox to release Lobo from his service. After this, Lobo becomes a full-time bounty hunter again.

===Li&#x27;l Lobo===
In the year 2000, a magical accident transforms Lobo into a teenager. In this condition, he joins Young Justice and eventually accompanies them to Apokolips, where he is killed in combat. However, the aforementioned magical accident has restored his ability to grow clones from a single drop of blood, and millions of Lobos rush into battle against Apokoliptian soldiers, whom the Lobos quickly defeat. The Lobos then turn on each other, until only one is left; in the process, the surviving Lobo regrows to adulthood. His time as a member of Young Justice becomes a distant memory. An additional weaker teenage Lobo remained, however, having hidden from the fight; he rejoins Young Justice and chooses to rename himself Slobo. Slobo&#x27;s body later degenerates, but Darkseid transports him to the 853rd century and transforms him into a statue before he can die.

===&quot;52&quot;===
In the 2006–07 miniseries &quot;52&quot;, Lobo reappears and encounters a group of heroes (consisting of Adam Strange, Animal Man, and Starfire), who find themselves stranded in space after the events of the 2005–2006 &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, he does not kill them. Lobo professes to have found religion, becoming the spiritual leader of Sector 3500, which was left in shambles by an unknown assailant. He is the current caretaker of the Emerald Eye of Ekron. After helping the lost heroes defeat Lady Styx, he brings the Emerald Eye to the triple-headed fish god, who agrees to release Lobo from his vow of non-violence in exchange. When told that the Emerald Eye is the only thing that can kill the fish god, Lobo blasts him with it.

===&quot;One Year Later&quot;===
Lobo appeared in &quot;Deadly Serious&quot;, a two-part crossover miniseries with Batman in August 2007, written and drawn by Sam Kieth. In addition, Lobo has fought the Teen Titans and Blue Beetle in their respective titles to stop a rocket for the Reach, in which he failed.

In the &quot;Reign in Hell&quot; miniseries, it is revealed that Lobo&#x27;s soul was still in Hell following a deal he made with Neron during the 1995 &quot;Underworld Unleashed&quot; storyline. Lobo&#x27;s suffering was enough to power Neron&#x27;s whole castle. Lobo was freed from his prison in a battle between Etrigan the Demon and Blue Devil, and he traveled through Hell to seek revenge on Neron. To buy time to fully recover before battling Lobo, Etrigan stole Blue Devil&#x27;s soul and informed him that he would have to fight Lobo to get it back. During Lobo&#x27;s rampage he cut off Zatara&#x27;s head, forcing his daughter Zatanna to send him to the Abyss, the soul death.

Later, Lobo is shown aiding the JLA during their mission into Hell, where he helps Fire defeat the god Plutus.

===&quot;Brightest Day&quot;===
In the 2010 &quot;Brightest Day&quot; storyline, Lobo appears on Earth to capture a bounty on Atrocitus&#x27;s head. After fighting Hal Jordan, Carol Ferris and Sinestro, he then flees. It is revealed that the fight was staged by Atrocitus himself. As a payment, Lobo is given a Red Lantern ring.

===&quot;R.E.B.E.L.S.&quot;===
Still wearing his red ring on a chain around his neck, Lobo is recruited from a bar by Vril Dox, who requires his help battling his &quot;father&quot; Brainiac and Pulsar Stargrave, a captured weapon. Even losing his spacehog, Lobo saves the planet Colu, but with Brainac and Pulsar Stargrave escaping. Lobo became a senior member of Vril Dox&#x27;s Legion based on the planet Rann. Lobo was the key to defeating Starro the Conqueror and his lieutenants, ensuring security for Rann, the Vega system and the galaxy. Unknown to Lobo, the Psions had created clones of Lobo attempting to bring back the Czarnian race, which could make them unstoppable, but the series ended before this was played out.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===

In 2011, DC Comics rebooted the DC Universe continuity in an initiative called &quot;The New 52&quot;. A reimagined version of Lobo debuted in &quot;Deathstroke&quot; (vol. 2) #9, written by Rob Liefeld. This Lobo is a Czarnian slaver who killed the rest of his race except for his beloved Princess Sheba. A second version, claiming to be the real Lobo and resembling the original version of the character, was introduced in &quot;Justice League&quot; (vol. 2) #23.2. He was originally the bodyguard to the Czarnian royal family, who utilized a Eucharist-like ritual involving the planet&#x27;s &quot;life blood&quot;, pools similar to Lazarus Pits. Drinking or bathing in these pools granted participants regenerative abilities, connecting them and the Emperor to the entire planet. However, an unknown party contaminated the &quot;life blood&quot;, causing the Czarnian Emperor and any citizenry that had participated in the ritual to go insane, which in turn forced Lobo to commit planetary euthanasia. A new series featuring this version of Lobo debuted in October 2014 and concluded with its December 2015 issue.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. Lobo debuts in &quot;Justice League vs. Suicide Squad&quot; as one of the villains freed by Maxwell Lord, evidently restored to his Pre-&quot;New 52&quot; persona. He is a member of Amanda Waller&#x27;s first Suicide Squad. Batman eventually implants a bomb into Lobo&#x27;s brain and detonates it, blowing up Lobo&#x27;s head. After Lobo regenerates it, he discovers Batman did so to free him from Lord&#x27;s control, and he later accepts Batman&#x27;s offer to join a new incarnation of the Justice League to repay the favor. In &quot;Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps&quot;, the &quot;New 52&quot; incarnation of Lobo is imprisoned in one of Brainiac&#x27;s bottles. Guy Gardner almost frees him, before Hal Jordan grabs the bottle and tells him it is better to &quot;leave him on the shelf&quot;.

==Powers and abilities==
In all comic books, Lobo is portrayed as a ruthless bounty hunter. He only has one rule: once he takes a contract, he finishes it no matter what, even if it means risking injury. If he has a counter-contract for even more money, then he will fulfill the new one.

Lobo possesses extraordinary strength of undefined limits. His strength, much like his other powers, varies greatly depending upon different artistic interpretations by various comic book writers. In some instances, he is depicted as being barely stronger than a human while, in others, he demonstrates physical strength on a similar level to Superman. He has shown to be a match in strength for Etrigan the Demon each time that they have met.

Lobo also possesses superhuman durability, which varies greatly too. Lobo is depicted, in some situations, as being injured by conventional bullets while, in other situations, he has the physical resiliency to stand toe to toe with Superman, survive unprotected in deep space, and withstand high level destructive weaponry and powerful explosive blasts without sustaining injury. He has displayed particular susceptibility to gaseous chemicals. In one instance, Lobo was declared immortal; after he died and went to Hell, he proved too much for the demons and, when he was then sent to Heaven, he wreaked so much havoc that he was permanently banished from the afterlife.

If Lobo sustains injury, his accelerated healing factor enables him to regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue with superhuman speed and efficiency and little apparent pain. Lobo also is functionally immortal. He is immune to the effects of aging and disease. As such, even though he can sustain sufficient injury to be out of commission for quite some time, he will apparently heal from any injury, given sufficient time. For instance, Lobo can regenerate out of a pool of his own blood, apparently recycling the cells.

He is a formidable combatant with expertise in multiple forms of armed and unarmed combat. His favorite weapon is a large titanium alloy chain with a large gutting hook connected at the end, often referred to as &quot;the garrote&quot;, that he keeps wrapped around his right wrist. At times, he also uses high-grade explosives and advanced firearms.

Despite his violent and loutish nature, Lobo seems to have a genius-level intellect in matters of destruction and violence. He can create complex virulent agents and the corresponding antidotes. In one version of his backstory, he released such a plague on Czarnia as a school science project. This resulted in the deaths of the entire population in the span of one week, he then proceeded to give himself an &quot;A&quot;. His vehicle, some sort of space-faring motorcycle (the &quot;Space Hog&quot;), often accompanies him. It is of his own design and, despite its size, it is capable of extended and speedy travel throughout space. Further, it protects those in its immediate vicinity from the hazards of space and somehow permits the ability to breathe and speak. He was also able to scavenge parts from a destroyed time hopper and attach them to his own bike, producing a working time machine. Lobo is fluent in many alien languages (according to Lobo, 17,897) and extremely knowledgeable in the locations and cultures of worlds without external references. Lobo is known for his awkward behavior and love for cigars. He was once known to destroy an entire planet for not finding the cigar of his liking.

It is not fully known the extent to which his powers are common for his race or unique to him. In the miniseries &quot;The Last Czarnian&quot; and elsewhere, it is stated that the cloning and healing abilities are traits possessed by all Czarnians, as is the apparent ability to survive in the vacuum of space. Before the reboot, Lobo was granted a Red Lantern Power Ring by Atrocitus during the &quot;Brightest Day&quot; storyline.

* In September 2009, Warner Bros. announced that Guy Ritchie was going to direct a live-action Lobo film that would have seen him travel to Earth and join forces with a teenage girl to find four fugitives. Ritchie was scheduled to begin production of &quot;Lobo&quot; in early 2010 and bring an &quot;irreverent, gruff tone&quot; to the film as he did with previous films &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; and &quot;Snatch&quot;, though the studio was reportedly aiming for a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. After Ritchie left the project to pursue working on a sequel to his film &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; instead, production on the &quot;Lobo&quot; film was put on hold. In 2012, Brad Peyton was attached to write and direct the film. In July, Dwayne Johnson was in talks with Joel Silver and Brad Peyton to portray Lobo. However, in February of the following year, Johnson left the project to portray Black Adam in &quot;Shazam!&quot;. Jason Fuchs was later hired to write the &quot;Lobo&quot; film&#x27;s script. Later in February 2018, Michael Bay was attached to direct the film after being inspired by the success of &quot;Deadpool&quot;.

<text>Jösse Car was a sports car manufacturer founded in 1994 and located in Arvika, Sweden. They produced one vehicle, the two seater roadster Indigo 3000. 

==History==
In October 1993, Bengt Lidmalm visited the TVR showroom in Earl&#x27;s Court, London, and began looking into the idea of creating his own sportscar. Lidmalm partnered with Sven-Olof Fogelberg of Volvo founding Jösse Car AB in Arvika, Sweden in 1994. Hans Philip Zackau who designed the Volvo 850 was recruited as chief designer to design their first car, the Indigo 3000 powered by a 3 litre Volvo engine and based around a lightweight body on a galvanized steel frame.

In March 1996, Jösse Car produced their first customer vehicle. In media tests, the Indigo 3000 performed well against competitor cars including the Alfa Romeo Spider and BMW Z3. The Indigo 3000 was awarded the &quot;Utmärkt Svensk Form&quot; (&#x27;Excellent Swedish Design&#x27;) in September. The company planned to produce 50 cars in 1996, 250 in 1997 and reaching a maximum manufacture of 500 vehicles per year from 1998 onwards.

The following year, Jösse Car opened their new factory in Åmål. The company also displayed the Indigo 3000 at AutoRAI 1997 in Amsterdam. They would manufacture a total of 44 cars between 1996 and 1999 before declaring bankruptcy in 2003.

In 2013, a decade after Jösse Car folded, co-founder Lidmalm spoke about his experiences during the summer speaker series on Sveriges Radio P4. He was a key support of an Indigo 3000 rally in Sweden during the summer of 2021. 20 of the original 44 cars were reuinited.

==Ownership and funding==

In 1996, the company ownership was split 75% to Lindmalm and 25% to Fogelberg. At the time their shareholding was worth a combined 1million SKr. Funding was provided by the Swedish Government via the Almi fund, and 6.5million SKr from a regional Swedish bank.

==Indigo 3000==

The Indigo 3000 is a Swedish sports car produced by Jösse Car from 1996–2000. 44 working cars were produced and it was the only car manufactured by Jösse Car before they folded. 

The Indigo 3000 is a two-seat, rear-wheel drive roadster powered by a 3.0 L, all aluminum, Volvo straight-six engine which is connected to a Volvo 960 gearbox driving the rear wheels. It could accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-97 km/h) in 6.5 seconds and has a claimed top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph).

<text>Anthony Berkeley Cox (5 July 1893 – 9 March 1971) was an English crime writer. He wrote under several pen-names, including Francis Iles, Anthony Berkeley and A. Monmouth Platts.

==Early life and education==
Anthony Berkeley Cox was born 5 July 1893 at Watford, son of medical practitioner Dr Alfred Edward Cox (1861–1936), of Monmouth House and The Platts, two adjoining properties on Watford High Street, and Sybil Maud (died 1924), née Iles, who ran a school at Monmouth House. His paternal grandfather was a Derby wine merchant. Cox had two younger siblings: Stephen Henry Johnson Cox (1899–1960), who became a schoolmaster, and Cynthia Cicely Cox (born 1897).

With his brother, Cox was educated at Rose Hill School, Banstead, Surrey, and from the age of 14 was educated at Sherborne School and then University College, Oxford.

==Career==
As an ex-cadet of the Officer Training Corps, Cox was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the British Army on 19 September 1914. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant on 4 November 1915. He served in 7th Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment during the First World War. He suffered from a gas attack in France, which caused long-term damage to his health. Following the attack, he was invalided back to England and then worked a number of desk jobs for the Army. On 15 April 1919, he was transferred to the unemployed list, therefore ending his military service.

Following the war, he worked as a journalist for many years, contributing to such magazines as &quot;Punch&quot; and &quot;The Humorist&quot;.

His first novel, &quot;The Layton Court Mystery&quot;, was published anonymously in 1925. It introduced Roger Sheringham, the amateur detective who features in many of the author&#x27;s novels including the classic &quot;Poisoned Chocolates Case&quot;. In 1930, Berkeley founded the Detection Club in London along with Agatha Christie, Freeman Wills Crofts and other established mystery writers.

His 1932 novel (as &quot;Francis Iles&quot;), &quot;Before the Fact&quot; was adapted into the 1941 classic film &quot;Suspicion&quot;, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine. &quot;Trial and Error&quot; was turned into the unusual 1941 film &quot;Flight from Destiny&quot; starring Thomas Mitchell.

He was a friend of EM Delafield and they each dedicated a book to the other (&quot;Jill&quot; and &quot;The Wychford Poisoning Case&quot;). She gently ragged him in her &quot;Provincial Lady Goes Further&quot; by having people tell her that &quot;Francis Iles&quot; is really Aldous Huxley or Edith Sitwell. The opening sentence of &quot;Malice Aforethought&quot; has been described as &quot;immortal&quot;: &quot;It was not until several weeks after he had decided to murder his wife that Doctor Bickleigh took any active steps in the matter.&quot;

In 1938, he took up book reviewing for &quot;John O&#x27;London&#x27;s Weekly&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, writing under his pen name Francis Iles. He also wrote for the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; in the 1940s and for the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, later &quot;The Guardian&quot;, from the mid-1950s until 1970. A key figure in the development of crime fiction, he died in 1971 in St John&#x27;s Wood, London. His estate was valued at £196,917 (£2,321,878 in 2023).

He also co-wrote other feature films like Tom Dey&#x27;s &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot; and its sequel &quot;Shanghai Knights&quot;, Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; and Rob Cohen&#x27;s blockbuster action-adventure film &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot;, as well as Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot;, the sequel to the iconic 1988 movie. He has worked alongside his writing/producing partner Alfred Gough since they met at USC School of Cinematic Arts.

==Early life==
Miles Millar grew up in Sydney, Australia but emigrated to the United Kingdom when he was 9 years old. He was educated at Claremont Fan Court School, and is a graduate of Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He attended The Peter Stark Producing Program at the University of Southern California where he teamed up with his writing/producing partner, Alfred Gough.

They sold their first script while still studying at USC. &quot;Mango&quot;, a buddy-cop story where a cop who was allergic to animals was paired with an orangutan, sold to New Line Cinema for $400,000. The film was never made, but proved to be a professional launching pad.

==Career==
Miles Millar and his professional partner Alfred Gough are prolific writers/producers. The films Millar and Gough have written or produced have a combined global box office in excess of one billion dollars. Their feature credits include Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, Tom Dey&#x27;s action-comedy &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot;, as well as its sequel, &quot;Shanghai Knights,&quot; starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. Other credits include Rob Cohen&#x27;s 2008 action-adventure &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot;, &quot;&quot;, Richard Donner&#x27;s 1998 buddy cop action &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot;, and D. J. Caruso&#x27;s 2011 science fiction action &quot;I Am Number Four&quot;. Millar and Gough also produced &quot;Hannah Montana: The Movie&quot;, which was based on the Disney Channel smash hit teen sitcom TV series of the same name starring Miley Cyrus. The feature marked the first film for the duo&#x27;s Walt Disney-based production company. 

Millar and Gough’s work also spans the world of television. The duo created and served as executive producers/showrunners of the Superman-based television action-adventure series &quot;Smallville&quot;, which aired from October 16, 2001 to May 13, 2011. It is the longest-running live-action comic book-based television series of all time, and was the No. 1 show in the history of The WB. Millar and Gough left the series in 2008, after seven seasons, breaking the news of their departure with an open letter posted to a &quot;Smallville&quot; fan site. In 2010, the duo filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against WB Television, claiming that Warner Bros., the studio that produced &quot;Smallville&quot;, had undercut potential profits by selling the series to WB network which it owned, thereby cutting the duo out of tens of millions of dollars. The lawsuit was finally settled in May 2013, mere weeks before a scheduled June trial; the terms of the settlement were not made known to the public.

In 2015, Millar and Gough began creating and producing the epic fantasy television series &quot;The Shannara Chronicles&quot; for MTV. It is an adaptation of The Sword of Shannara trilogy of fantasy novels by Terry Brooks. It follows three heroes as they protect an ancient tree to stop the escape of banished demons. The series was filmed in the Auckland Film Studios and on location elsewhere in New Zealand. The series starred Austin Butler, Ivana Baquero and Manu Bennett. Jon Favreau was one of the executive producers along with Dan Farrah. The pilot episode was directed by Jonathan Liebesman.

The first season of &quot;The Shannara Chronicles&quot; premiered on MTV in the United States on January 5, 2016, and consisted of 10 episodes. MTV originally greenlit a second season in April 2016; however, in May 2017, it was announced that the series would relocate to Spike (now Paramount Network). The second season premiered on October 11, 2017, and concluded November 22, 2017. On January 16, 2018, it was announced that the series had been cancelled after two seasons and that the producers were shopping the series to other networks. The series was later considered officially concluded but has since generated a cult following on Netflix.

In June 2015, the duo began creating and producing the wuxia-influenced dystopian television series &quot;Into the Badlands&quot; for AMC Networks. The martial arts drama was set in a gun free post apocalyptic America where warring barons had personal armies of lethally trained fighters. The series was notable as one of the only hour long dramas in American television history to feature an Asian American (Daniel Wu) as its lead. The show was a ratings hit, but received a mix response from critics. Nick Frost joined the cast in season two and proved a very popular addition to the fans of the series. The show&#x27;s mythology was very loosely based on the classic Chinese text, &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. Each episode featured intricate martial arts fights that were staged and directed by legendary Hong Kong fight choreographers Huen Chiu Ku (aka Master Dee Dee Ku) and Andy Cheng. The series starred Daniel Wu, Marton Csokas, Emily Beecham, Aramis Knight and Orla Brady. The first season was filmed in New Orleans, but subsequent seasons were shot in and around Dublin, Ireland. &quot;Into The Badlands&quot; ran for 32 episodes and was cancelled due to a regime change at AMC Networks. Millar directed episodes 13 and 14 in season three of the series.

In October 2020, Millar and Gough sold a series to Netflix based on the character of Wednesday Addams. The series was created by Millar and Gough, but Tim Burton teamed with the duo as an executive producer and directed the first four episodes. &quot;Wednesday&quot; represents Burton&#x27;s first foray into television and stars Jenna Ortega in the title role. The series also stars Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia Addams, Luis Guzman as Gomez Addams as well as Gwendoline Christie as Larissa Weems. Since the show&#x27;s premiere, it has become the most viewed English-language series on Netflix at 1.7 billion streaming hours. The show was a critical hit and was recognized with numerous awards. Millar and Gough were nominated for Golden Globe, BAFTA and Emmy awards. The show was nominated for 12 Emmys and won four. It was awarded the Saturn Award for best Fantasy Series, Critics&#x27; Choice Super Award for Best Limited Series, Kid’s Choice Award for Favorite Family TV Show. Millar, Gough, Burton, and Ortega collaborated again on &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot;, set for release in September 2024.

In May 2024, it was announced that the second season of &quot;Wednesday&quot; had commenced production in Dublin, Ireland. A promo featuring Thing delivering scripts and announcing the new cast was directed by Millar, as well as returning cast, Jenna Ortega, Emma Myers, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Luis Guzman, Hunter Doohan, Georgie Farmer, new additions include Steve Buscemi, Joanna Lumley, Thandiwe Newton, Heather Matarazzo, and Evie Templeton. 

Millar and Gough signed a first-look deal with Sony Pictures in April 2024 to develop films through the Millar/Gough Ink banner.

Millar and Gough were also known as the producers of UPN&#x27;s 1999-2000 American action drama &quot;The Strip&quot; (starring Sean Patrick Flannery) and ABC&#x27;s 2011 action crime drama &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, with the final episode of the latter series left unaired in the United States. Millar and Gough also began operating the production company, Millar/Gough Ink, back in October 1999.

Millar and Gough also produced the unsold live-action pilot, &quot;Aquaman&quot; (which initially premiered on July 25, 2006 on iTunes), which was based on the DC Comics character of the same name, and it has been run as a standalone episode.

Gough and Millar sold their first script while still studying at USC. &quot;Mango&quot;, a buddy-cop story where a cop who was allergic to animals was paired with an orangutan, sold to New Line Cinema for $400,000. The film was never made, but launched the duo&#x27;s professional careers.

==Career==
Alfred Gough and Miles Millar are prolific writers/producers. Their feature credits include the action-adventure &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot;, the hit action-comedy &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot;, as well as its sequel &quot;Shanghai Knights&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; directed by Sam Raimi, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot;, and &quot;I Am Number Four&quot;. Along with Millar, Gough also produced &quot;Hannah Montana: The Movie&quot;, based on the smash hit Disney Channel teen sitcom series of the same name. The feature marked the first film for the duo&#x27;s Walt Disney Company-based independent production studio, Millar/Gough Ink.

Gough and Millar’s work also spans the world of television. Gough and Miles Milar created and served as executive producers/showrunners for the critically acclaimed and Superman-based action-adventure hit series &quot;Smallville&quot;, which aired from October 16, 2001 to May 13, 2011. &quot;Smallville&quot; is the longest-running comic book-based series of all time and was the top show in the history of the WB Television Network. Gough and Millar left the series in 2008, after seven seasons, breaking the news of their departure with an open letter posted to a &quot;Smallville&quot; fan site. 

In 2015, Gough and Millar both began production of &quot;The Shannara Chronicles&quot;, an epic fantasy television series Millar Gough Ink created and produced for MTV. It is an adaptation of The Sword of Shannara trilogy of fantasy novels by Terry Brooks. It follows three heroes as they protect an ancient tree to stop the escape of banished demons. The series was filmed in the Auckland Film Studios and on location elsewhere in New Zealand. The series starred Austin Butler, Ivana Baquero and Manu Bennett. Jon Favreau was one of the executive producers along with Dan Farrah. The pilot episode was directed by Jonathan Liebesman.

The first season of &quot;The Shannara Chronicles&quot; premiered on MTV in the United States on January 5, 2016, and consisted of 10 episodes. MTV originally greenlit a second season in April 2016; however, in May 2017, it was announced that the series would relocate to Spike (now Paramount Network). The second season premiered on October 11, 2017, and concluded November 22, 2017. On January 16, 2018, it was announced that the series had been cancelled after two seasons and that the producers were shopping the series to other networks. The series was later considered officially concluded but has since generated a cult following on Netflix.

In June 2015, Gough and Millar began production of &quot;Into the Badlands&quot; a series the company created for AMC Networks. The martial arts drama was set in a gun free post apocalyptic America where warring barons had personal armies of lethally trained fighters. The series was notable as one of the only hour long dramas in American television history to feature an Asian American (Daniel Wu) as its lead. The show was a ratings hit, but received a mix response from critics. Nick Frost joined the cast in season two and proved a very popular addition to the fans of the series. The show&#x27;s mythology was very loosely based on the classic Chinese text, &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. Each episode featured intricate martial arts fights that were staged and directed by legendary Hong Kong fight choreographers Huen Chiu Ku (aka Master Dee Dee Ku) and Andy Cheng. The series starred Daniel Wu, Marton Csokas, Emily Beecham, Aramis Knight and Orla Brady. The first season was filmed in New Orleans, but subsequent seasons were shot in and around Dublin, Ireland. &quot;Into The Badlands&quot; ran for 32 episodes and was cancelled due to a regime change at AMC Networks.

In October 2020, Millar and Gough sold a series to Netflix based on the character of Wednesday Addams. The series was created by Millar and Gough, but Tim Burton teamed with the duo as an executive producer and directed the first four episodes. &quot;Wednesday&quot; represents Burton&#x27;s first foray into television and stars Jenna Ortega in the title role. The series also stars Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia Addams, Luis Guzman as Gomez Addams as well as Gwendoline Christie as Larissa Weems. Since the show&#x27;s premiere, it has become the most viewed English-language series on Netflix at 1.7 billion streaming hours. The show was a critical hit and was recognized with numerous awards. Millar and Gough were nominated for Golden Globe, BAFTA and Emmy awards. The show was nominated for 12 Emmys and won four. It was awarded the Saturn Award for best Fantasy Series, Critics&#x27; Choice Super Award for Best Limited Series, Kid’s Choice Award for Favorite Family TV Show. Millar, Gough, Burton, and Ortega collaborated again on &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot;, set for release in September 2024.

Gough and Millar created UPN&#x27;s 1999 series &quot;The Strip&quot; starring &quot;Sean Patrick Flannery&quot;.

Gough and Millar signed a first-look deal with Sony Pictures in April 2024 to develop films through the Millar/Gough Ink banner.

Millar/Gough Ink also produced ABC&#x27;s 2011 action crime drama &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. It also produced the 2006 television pilot of Aquaman, which was based on the DC Comics character of the same name. 

Al and Beth Corets formed Oddly Specific Productions in 2022 which co-produced the Tony Award winning Best Musical THE OUTSIDERS as well as the Tony nominated musical SUFFS and upcoming ROMEO &amp; JULIET and GYPSY on Broadway.

<text>A modular building is a prefabricated building that consists of repeated sections called modules. Modularity involves constructing sections away from the building site, then delivering them to the intended site. Installation of the prefabricated sections is completed on site. Prefabricated sections are sometimes placed using a crane. The modules can be placed side-by-side, end-to-end, or stacked, allowing for a variety of configurations and styles. After placement, the modules are joined together using inter-module connections, also known as inter-connections. The inter-connections tie the individual modules together to form the overall building structure.

== Uses ==

Modular buildings may be used for long-term, temporary or permanent facilities, such as construction camps, schools and classrooms, civilian and military housing, and industrial facilities. Modular buildings are used in remote and rural areas where conventional construction may not be reasonable or possible, for example, the Halley VI accommodation pods used for a BAS Antarctic expedition. Other uses have included churches, health care facilities, sales and retail offices, fast food restaurants and cruise ship construction. They can also be used in areas that have weather concerns, such as hurricanes. Modular buildings are often used to provide temporary facilities, including toilets and ablutions at events. The portability of the buildings makes them popular with hire companies and clients alike. The use of modular buildings enables events to be held at locations where existing facilities are unavailable, or unable to support the number of event attendees.

==Construction process==
Construction is offsite, using lean manufacturing techniques to prefabricate single or multi-story buildings in deliverable module sections. Often, modules are based around standard 20 foot containers, using the same dimensions, structures, building and stacking/placing techniques, but with smooth (instead of corrugated) walls, glossy white paint, and provisions for windows, power, potable water, sewage lines, telecommunications and air conditioning. Permanent Modular Construction (PMC) buildings are manufactured in a controlled setting and can be constructed of wood, steel, or concrete. Modular components are typically constructed indoors on assembly lines. Modules&#x27; construction may take as little as ten days but more often one to three months. PMC modules can be integrated into site built projects or stand alone and can be delivered with MEP, fixtures and interior finishes.

The buildings are 60% to 90% completed offsite in a factory-controlled environment, and transported and assembled at the final building site. This can comprise the entire building or be components or subassemblies of larger structures. In many cases, modular contractors work with traditional general contractors to exploit the resources and advantages of each type of construction. Completed modules are transported to the building site and assembled by a crane. Placement of the modules may take from several hours to several days. Off-site construction running in parallel to site preparation providing a shorter time to project completion is one of the common selling points of modular construction. Modular construction timeline

Permanent modular buildings are built to meet or exceed the same building codes and standards as site-built structures and the same architect-specified materials used in conventionally constructed buildings are used in modular construction projects. PMC can have as many stories as building codes allow. Unlike relocatable buildings, PMC structures are intended to remain in one location for the duration of their useful life.

==Manufacturing considerations==
The entire process of modular construction places significance on the design stage. This is where practices such as Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA) are used to ensure that assembly tolerances are controlled throughout manufacture and assembly on site. It is vital that there is enough allowance in the design to allow the assembly to take up any &quot;slack&quot; or misalignment of components. The use of advanced CAD systems, 3D printing and manufacturing control systems are important for modular construction to be successful. This is quite unlike on-site construction where the tradesman can often make the part to suit any particular installation.

===Upfront production investment===
The development of factory facilities for modular homes requires significant upfront investment. To help address housing shortages in the 2010s, the United Kingdom Government (via Homes England) invested in modular housing initiatives. Several UK companies (for example, Ilke Homes, L&amp;G Modular Homes, House by Urban Splash, Modulous, TopHat and Lighthouse) were established to develop modular homes as an alternative to traditionally-built residences, but failed as they could not book revenues quickly enough to cover the costs of establishing manufacturing facilities.

IIke Homes opened a factory in Knaresborough, Yorkshire in 2018, and Homes England invested £30m in November 2019, and a further £30m in September 2021. Despite a further fund-raising round, raising £100m in December 2022, Ilke Homes went into administration on 30 June 2023, with most of the company&#x27;s 1,150 staff made redundant, and debts of £320m, including £68m owed to Homes England.

In 2015 Legal &amp; General launched a modular homes operation, L&amp;G Modular Homes, opening a 550,000 sq ft factory in Sherburn-in-Elmet, near Selby in Yorkshire. The company incurred large losses as it invested in its factory before earning any revenues; by 2019, it had lost over £100m. Sales revenues from a Selby project, plus schemes in Kent and West Sussex, started to flow in 2022, by which time the business&#x27;s total losses had grown to £174m. Production was halted in May 2023, with L&amp;G blaming local planning delays and the COVID-19 pandemic for its failure to grow its sales pipeline. The enterprise incurred total losses over seven years of £295m.

===Market acceptance===

Some home buyers and some lending institutions resist consideration of modular homes as equivalent in value to site-built homes. While the homes themselves may be of equivalent quality, entrenched zoning regulations and psychological marketplace factors may create hurdles for buyers or builders of modular homes and should be considered as part of the decision-making process when exploring this type of home as a living and/or investment option. In the UK and Australia, modular homes have become accepted in some regional areas; however, they are not commonly built in major cities. Modular homes are becoming increasingly common in Japanese urban areas, due to improvements in design and quality, speed and compactness of onsite assembly, as well as due to lowering costs and ease of repair after earthquakes. Recent innovations allow modular buildings to be indistinguishable from site-built structures. Surveys have shown that individuals can rarely tell the difference between a modular home and a site-built home.

===Modular homes vs. mobile homes===
Differences include the building codes that govern the construction, types of material used and how they are appraised by banks for lending purposes. Modular homes are built to either local or state building codes as opposed to manufactured homes, which are also built in a factory but are governed by a federal building code. The codes that govern the construction of modular homes are exactly the same codes that govern the construction of site-constructed homes. In the United States, all modular homes are constructed according to the International Building Code (IBC), IRC, BOCA or the code that has been adopted by the local jurisdiction. In some states, such as California, mobile homes must still be registered yearly, like vehicles or standard trailers, with the Department of Motor Vehicles or other state agency. This is true even if the owners remove the axles and place it on a permanent foundation.

===Recognizing a mobile or manufactured home===
A mobile home should have a small metal tag on the outside of each section. If a tag cannot be located, details about the home can be found in the electrical panel box. This tag should also reveal a manufacturing date. Modular homes do not have metal tags on the outside but will have a dataplate installed inside the home, usually under the kitchen sink or in a closet. The dataplate will provide information such as the manufacturer, third party inspection agency, appliance information, and manufacture date.

===Materials===
The materials used in modular buildings are of the same quality and durability as those used in traditional construction, preserving characteristics such as acoustic insulation and energy efficiency, as well as allowing for attractive and innovative designs thanks to their versatility. Most commonly used are steel, wood and concrete.
* Steel: Because it is easily moldable, it allows for innovation in design and aesthetics.
* Wood: Wood is an essential part of most modular buildings. Thanks to its lightness, it facilitates the work of assembling and moving the prefabricated modules.
* Concrete: Concrete offers a solid structure that is ideal for the structural reinforcement of permanent modular buildings. It is increasingly being used as a base material in this type of building, thanks to its various characteristics such as fire resistance, energy savings, greater acoustic insulation, and durability.

Wood-frame floors, walls and roof are often utilized. Some modular homes include brick or stone exteriors, granite counters and steeply pitched roofs. Modulars can be designed to sit on a perimeter foundation or basement. In contrast, mobile homes are constructed with a steel chassis that is integral to the integrity of the floor system. Modular buildings can be custom built to a client&#x27;s specifications. Current designs include multi-story units, multi-family units and entire apartment complexes. The negative stereotype commonly associated with mobile homes has prompted some manufacturers to start using the term &quot;off-site construction.&quot;

New modular offerings include other construction methods such as cross-laminated timber frames.

=== Financing ===
Mobile homes often require special lenders.

Modular homes on the other hand are financed as site built homes with a construction loan

==Standards and zoning considerations==
Typically, modular dwellings are built to local, state or council code, resulting in dwellings from a given manufacturing facility having differing construction standards depending on the final destination of the modules. The most important zones that manufacturers have to take into consideration are local wind, heat, and snow load zones. For example, homes built for final assembly in a hurricane-prone, earthquake or flooding area may include additional bracing to meet local building codes. Steel and/or wood framing are common options for building a modular home.

Some US courts have ruled that zoning restrictions applicable to mobile homes do not apply to modular homes since modular homes are designed to have a permanent foundation. Additionally, in the US, valuation differences between modular homes and site-built homes are often negligible in real estate appraisal practice; modular homes can, in some market areas, (depending on local appraisal practices per Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice) be evaluated the same way as site-built dwellings of similar quality. In Australia, manufactured home parks are governed by additional legislation that does not apply to permanent modular homes. Possible developments in equivalence between modular and site-built housing types for the purposes of real estate appraisals, financing and zoning may increase the sales of modular homes over time.

===CLASP (Consortium of Local Authorities Special Programme)===
The Consortium of Local Authorities Special Programme (abbreviated and more commonly referred to as CLASP) was formed in England in 1957 to combine the resources of local authorities with the purpose of developing a prefabricated school building programme. Initially developed by Charles Herbert Aslin, the county architect for Hertfordshire, the system was used as a model for several other counties, most notably Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. CLASP&#x27;s popularity in these coal mining areas was in part because the system permitted fairly straightforward replacement of subsidence-damaged sections of building.

===Building strength===

Modular homes are designed to be stronger than traditional homes by, for example, replacing nails with screws, adding glue to joints, and using 8–10% more lumber than conventional housing. This is to help the modules maintain their structural integrity as they are transported on trucks to the construction site. However, there are few studies on the response of modular buildings to transport and handling stresses. It is therefore presently difficult to predict transport induced damage.

When FEMA studied the destruction wrought by Hurricane Andrew in Dade County Florida, they concluded that modular and masonry homes fared best compared to other construction.

===CE marking===
The CE mark is a construction norm that guarantees the user of mechanical resistance and strength of the structure. It is a label given by European community empowered authorities for end-to-end process mastering and traceability.

All manufacturing operations are being monitored and recorded:
* Suppliers have to be known and certified,
* Raw materials and goods being sourced are to be recorded by batch used,
* Elementary products are recorded and their quality is monitored,
* Assembly quality is managed and assessed on a step by step basis,
* When a modular unit is finished, a whole set of tests are performed and if quality standards are met, a unique number and EC stamp is attached to and on the unit.

This ID and all the details are recorded in a database, At any time, the producer has to be able to answer and provide all the information from each step of the production of a single unit, The EC certification guaranties standards in terms of durability, resistance against wind and earthquakes.

== Open modular building ==
The term Modularity can be perceived in different ways. It can even be extended to building P2P (peer-to-peer) applications; where a tailored use of the P2P technology is with the aid of a modular paradigm. Here, well-understood components with clean interfaces can be combined to implement arbitrarily complex functions in the hopes of further proliferating self-organising P2P technology. Open modular buildings are an excellent example of this. Modular building can also be open source and green. 
Bauwens, Kostakis and Pazaitis elaborate on this kind of modularity. They link modularity to the construction of houses.

This commons-based activity is geared towards modularity. The construction of modular buildings enables a community to share designs and tools related to all the different parts of house construction. A socially-oriented endeavour that deals with the external architecture of buildings and the internal dynamics of open source commons. People are thus provided with the tools to reconfigure the public sphere in the area where they live, especially in urban environments. There is a robust socializing element that is reminiscent of pre-industrial vernacular architecture and community-based building.

Some organisations already provide modular housing. Such organisations are relevant as they allow for the online sharing of construction plans and tools. These plans can be then assembled, through either digital fabrication like 3D printing or even sourcing low-cost materials from local communities. It has been noticed that given how easy it is to use these low-cost materials are (for example: plywood), it can help increase the permeation of these open buildings to areas or communities that lack the know-how or abilities of conventional architectural or construction firms. Ergo, it allows for a fundamentally more standardised way of constructing houses and buildings. The overarching idea behind it remains key - to allow for easy access to user-friendly layouts which anyone can use to build in a more sustainable and affordable way.

Modularity in this sense is building a house from different standardised parts, like solving a jigsaw puzzle.

3D printing can be used to build the house.

The main standard is OpenStructures and its derivative Autarkytecture.

== Research and development ==
Modular construction is the subject of continued research and development worldwide as the technology is applied to taller and taller buildings. Research and development is carried out by modular building companies and also research institutes such as the Modular Building Institute and the Steel Construction Institute.
