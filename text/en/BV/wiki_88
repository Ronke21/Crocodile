<text>Amdo ( ; ), also known as Domey (), is one of the three traditional Tibetan regions. It encompasses a large area from the Machu (Yellow River) to the Drichu (Yangtze). Amdo is mostly coterminous with China&#x27;s present-day Qinghai province, but also includes small portions of Sichuan and Gansu provinces.

Amdo became a part of the Tibetan Empire until the 9th century and was ruled by a local Tibetan theocracy called Tsongkha from the 10th century to the 12th century. In the 13th century Mongol forces conquered the area which led to the beginning of a priest and patron relationship. From the 14th century to the 16th century, the Ming Dynasty controlled some border areas of Amdo while Mongol presence remained significant. In the 1720s the Yongzheng Emperor of Qing dynasty seized Amdo from the Dzungars and began forming the modern boundaries of Qinghai. He allowed most of the area to be administered by a series of local Tibetan rulers associated with the Ü-Tsang government through monastery systems but not directly governed by the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Ganden Phodrang. From 1917 parts of Amdo were occupied by warlords of the Ma clique, who joined the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) in 1928. By 1952, Chinese Communist Party forces had annexed Tibet and defeated both Kuomintang and Tibetan forces, solidifying their hold on the area roughly by 1958.

Amdo is the home of many important Tibetan Buddhism spiritual leaders, lamas, monks, nuns, and scholars, including the 14th Dalai Lama, the 10th Panchen Lama Choekyi Gyaltsen, and the great Gelug school reformer Je Tsongkhapa.

==Names and geography ==
Amdo is one of the traditional regions of Greater or ethnographic Tibet. The other regions are Ü-Tsang, also known as political or central Tibet, to the west and Kham to the southeast. Historically, Amdo and Kham together were also called Do Kham on maps and manuscripts. Amdo encompasses the upper reaches of the Machu or Yellow River and Lake Qinghai. Its southern border is the Bayan Har Mountains. The area is wind-swept and tree-less, with much grass. Animals of the region consist of the wild yak and the kiang. Domesticated animals of the region consist of the domestic yak and dzo, goats, sheep, and the Mongolian horse. Amdo has been famous in epic story and in history as a land where splendid horses are raised and run wild.

==Demographics==
===Historical demographics===
In historical times, the people of the region were typically non-Tibetan, such as the Mongols or the Hor people, although the latter were able to speak a Tibetan language. Other indigenous peoples included the Qiang, the Sumpa, and the Tuyuhun. People from Amdo and Kham have traditionally identified themselves as Amdowas and Khampas rather than Tibetans, sometimes more connected to the Chinese than they were to Ü-Tsang (Central Tibet).

===Present demographics===
The inhabitants of Amdo are referred to as Amdowa () as a distinction from the Tibetans of Kham (Khampa, ) and Ü-Tsang, however, they are all considered ethnically Tibetan.

Today, ethnic Tibetans predominate in the western and southern parts of Amdo, which are now administered as various Tibetan, Tibetan-Qiang, or Mongol-Tibetan autonomous prefectures. The Han Chinese are majority in the northern part (Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture) and eastern part (Xining city and Haidong city) of Qinghai province. While Xining city and Haidong city are geographically small compared to the rest of Qinghai province, this area has the largest population density, with the result that the Han Chinese outnumber other ethnicities in Qinghai province generally.

The majority of Amdo Tibetans live in the larger part of Qinghai province, including the Mtshobyang (མཚོ་བྱང་།; Haibei in Chinese) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (TAP), Mtsholho (མཚོ་ལྷོ་།; Hainan) TAP, Rmalho (རྨ་ལྷོ་།; Huangnan) TAP, and Mgolog (མགོ་ལོག།; Guoluo) TAP, as well as in the Kanlho (ཀན་ལྷོ།; Gannan) TAP of the southwest Gansu province, and sections of the Rngaba (རྔ་བ།; Aba) Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous prefecture of north-west Sichuan province. Additionally, a great many Amdo Tibetans live within the Haidong (མཚོ་ཤར།; Wylie: &quot;mtsho shar&quot;) Prefecture of Qinghai which is located to the east of the Qinghai Lake (མཚོ་སྔོན།, Wylie: &quot;mtsho sngon&quot;) and around Xining (ཟི་ལིང།; &quot;zi ling&quot;) city, but they constitute only a minority (ca. 8.5%) of the total population there and so the region did not attain TAP status. The vast Haixi (མཚོ་ནུབ།; &quot;mtsho nub&quot;) Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, to the west of the Qinghai Lake, also has a minority Tibetan population (ca. 10%), and only those Tibetans in the eastern parts of this Prefecture are Amdo inhabitants.

Mongols too have been long-term settlers in Amdo, arriving first during the time of Genghis Khan, but particularly in a series of settlement waves during the Ming period. Over the centuries, most of the Amdo Mongols have become highly Tibetanised and, superficially at least, it is now difficult to discern their original non-Tibetan ethnicity.

==Language==

There are many dialects of the Tibetan language spoken in Amdo due to the geographical isolation of many groups. Written Tibetan is the same throughout Tibetan-speaking regions and is based on Classical Tibetan.

Many non-Tibetans of the region are multilingual and can speak Amdo Tibetan, making it difficult to ascertain their ethnicity based on language alone.

==History==
===3rd century===
The Qiang people were early users of iron and stories abound of them in their iron breast-plates with iron swords.

===7th century===
From the seventh through the ninth century, the Tibetan Empire expanded into Amdo. The Qiang, Sumpa, Tuyuhun, and other peoples of the region were gradually tibetanized. During this period, control of Amdo moved from Songtsen Gampo and his successors to the royal family&#x27;s ministers, the Gar (). These ministers had their positions inherited from their parents, similar to the emperor. King Tüsong tried to wrest control of this area from the ministers, unsuccessfully.

=== 9th century ===
In 821, a treaty established the borders between the Tibetan Empire and the Tang dynasty, while three stele were built – one at the border, one in Lhasa, and one in Chang&#x27;an. The Tibetan army settled within the eastern frontier.

After 838 when Tibet&#x27;s King Lang darma killed his brother, the Tibetan Empire broke into independent principalities, while Do Kham (Amdo and Kham) maintained culturally and religiously Tibetan. Within Amdo, the historical independent polities of hereditary rulers and kingdoms remained, while Mongol and Chinese populations fluctuated among the indigenous peoples and Tibetans. During this time period, Buddhist monks from Central Tibet exiled to the Amdo region.

There is a historical account of an official from the 9th century sent to collect taxes to Amdo. Instead, he acquires a fief. He then tells of the 10 virtues of the land. Two of the virtues are in the grass, one for meadows near home, one for distant pastures. Two virtues in soil, one to build houses and one for good fields. Two virtues are in the water, one for drinking and one for irrigation. There are two in the stone, one for building and one for milling. The timber has two virtues, one for building and one for firewood. The original inhabitants of the Amdo region were the forest-dwellers (nags-pa), the mountain-dwellers (ri-pa), the plains-dwellers (thang-pa), the grass-men (rtsa-mi), and the woodsmen (shing-mi). The grass men were famous for their horses.

===10th and 11th century===
Gewasel is a monk that helped resurrect Tibetan Buddhism. He was taught as a child and showed amazing enthusiasm for the religion. When he was ordained he went in search of teachings. After obtaining the Vinaya, he was set to travel to Central Tibet, but for a drought. Instead he chose to travel in solitude to Amdo. Locals had heard of him and his solitude was not to be as he was sought after. In time he established a line of refugee monks in Amdo and with the wealth that he acquired he built temples and stupas also. The area was ruled by a Tibetan theocracy called Tsongkha from 997 to 1104. It was frequently drawn into conflicts with the Western Xia, formed by the Tangut people possibly of Qiang descent, as well as the Song, Liao, and Jin dynasties.

===13th century===
The Mongols had conquered eastern Amdo by 1240 and would manage it under the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs, separately from the other territories administered by the Yuan dynasty. A priest and patron relationship began. Drogön Chögyal Phagpa, a Tibetan lama, visited Kublai Khan and became so popular that he was made Kublai&#x27;s spiritual guide and later appointed by him to the rank of priest king of Tibet and constituted ruler of (1) Tibet Proper, comprising the thirteen states of Ü-Tsang; (2) Kham, and (3) Amdo, but kingdoms in Amdo and Kham remained largely independent of central Tibet. He spent his later years at Sakya Monastery in Ü-Tsang, which required that he travel through Amdo regularly. On one of these trips, he encountered armed resistance in Amdo and required escorts from Mongol Princes to travel through Amdo. While the concept of &quot;Tibet&#x27;s Three Regions&quot; can be dated back to Tibetan Empire, Dunhuang manuscripts referring to the eastern parts of its territory as mdo-gams () and mdo-smad (), Yuan confirmed the division, and Do Kham as two well defined commanderies, along with Ü-Tsang, were collectively referred to as the three commanderies of Tibet since then. Tibet regained its independence from the Mongols before native Chinese overthrew the Yuan dynasty in 1368, although it avoided directly resisting the Yuan court until the latter&#x27;s fall. By 1343, Mongol authority in Amdo had weakened considerably: Köden’s fiefdom had been leaderless for some time, and the Tibetans were harassing the Mongols near Liangzhou (byang ngos). In 1347, a general rebellion erupted in some two hundred places in eastern Tibet, and though troops were sent to suppress them, by 1355 eastern Tibet was no longer mentioned in the dynastic history of the Mongols.

===14th to 16th century===
Although the following Ming Dynasty nominally maintained the Mongol divisions of Tibet with some sub-division, its power is weaker and influenced Amdo mostly at their borders. The Mongols again seized political control in Amdo areas from the middle of the 16th century. However, the Ming Dynasty continued to retain control in Hezhou and Xining wei. As trade between Mongols, Tibetans, Muslim and Han Chinese deepened, a system of &quot;xiejia&quot; developed around Gansu. They initially served as lodgings for travelers but eventually assumed additional responsibilities, such as regulating commerce, collecting taxes, and settling legal disputes alongside the local &quot;yamens&quot;.

===17th century===
Upper (Kokonor) Mongols from northern Xinjiang and Khalkha came there in 16th and 17th centuries. Power struggles among various Mongol factions in Tibet and Amdo led to a period alternating between the supremacy of the Dalai Lama (nominally) and Mongol overlords. In 1642, Tibet was reunified under the 5th Dalai Lama, by gaining spiritual and temporal authority through the efforts of the Mongol king, Güshi Khan. This allowed the Gelug school and its incarnated spiritual leaders, the Dalai Lamas, to gain enough support to last through the present day. Gushi Khan also returned portions of Eastern Tiber (Kham) to Tibet, but his base in the Kokonor region of Amdo remained under Mongol control.

=== 18th century ===
In 1705, with the approval of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty, Lha-bzang Khan of the Khoshut deposed the regent and killed the 6th Dalai Lama. The Dzungar Mongols invaded Tibet during the chaos, and held the entire region until their final defeat by an expedition of the Qing imperial army in 1720.

When the Manchu Qing dynasty rose to power in the early 18th century it established Xining, a town to the north of Amdo, as the administrative base for the area. Amdo was placed within the Qinghai Region. During this period they were ruled by the Amban, who allowed near total autonomy by the monasteries and the other local leaders.

The 18th century saw the Qing Empire continue to expand further and further into Tibet as it engulfed Eastern Tibet including Amdo and even assumed control over Central Tibet.

The Yongzheng Emperor seized full control of Qinghai (Amdo) in the 1720s. The boundaries of Xining Prefecture, which contains most of Amdo, with Sichuan and Tibet-proper was established following this. The boundary of Xining Prefecture and Ü-Tsang, or Central Tibet, was the Dangla Mountains. This roughly corresponds with the modern boundary of Qinghai with the Tibet Autonomous Region. The boundary of Xining Prefecture with Sichuan was also set at this time, dividing the Ngaba area of the former Amdo into Sichuan. This boundary also roughly corresponds with the modern boundary of Qinghai with Sichuan. A new boundary, following the Ning-ching mountain range, was established between Sichuan and Tibet. East of these mountains, local chieftains ruled under the nominal authority of the Sichuan provincial government; Lhasa administered the area to the west. The 1720s thus saw Tibet&#x27;s first major reduction in area in centuries. The Gansu region bordering Tibet was administered by an imperial viceroy. Portions of the country were placed under Chinese law while the Tibetans enjoyed almost complete independence, ruled by Tibetan chiefs that held grants or commissions from the Imperial Government.

===20th century===
In 1906, the 13th Dalai Lama while touring the country, was enticed by a procession of a thousand lamas, to stay at the temple at Kumbum. He spent a year resting and learning among other things Sanskrit and poetry.

In 1912, Qing Dynasty collapsed and relative independence followed with the Dalai Lama ruling Central Tibet. Eastern Tibet, including Amdo and Kham, were ruled by local and regional warlords and chiefs. The Hui Muslims administered the agricultural areas in the north and east of the region. Amdo saw numerous powerful leaders including both secular and non. The monasteries, such as Labrang, Rebkong, and Taktsang Lhamo supervised the choosing of the local leaders or headmen in the areas under their control. These tribes consisted of several thousand nomads. Meanwhile, Sokwo, Ngawa, and Liulin, had secular leaders appointed, with some becoming kings and even creating familial dynasties. This secular form of government went as far as Machu.

The Muslim warlord Ma Qi waged war in the name of the Republic of China against the Labrang monastery and Goloks. After ethnic rioting between Muslims and Tibetans emerged in 1918, Ma Qi defeated the Tibetans, then commenced to tax the town heavily for 8 years. In 1925, a Tibetan rebellion broke out, with thousands of Tibetans driving out the Muslims. Ma Qi responded with 3,000 Chinese Muslim troops, who retook Labrang and machine gunned thousands of Tibetan monks as they tried to flee. Ma Qi besieged Labrang numerous times, the Tibetans and Mongols fought against his Muslim forces for control of Labrang, until Ma Qi gave it up in 1927. His forces were praised by foreigners who traveled through Qinghai for their fighting abilities. However, that was not the last Labrang saw of General Ma. The Muslim forces looted and ravaged the monastery again.

In 1928, the Ma Clique formed an alliance with the Kuomintang. In the 1930s, the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang, the son of Ma Qi, seized the northeast corner of Amdo in the name of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s weak central government, effectively incorporating it into the Chinese province of Qinghai. From that point until 1949, much of the rest of Amdo was gradually assimilated into the Kuomintang Chinese provincial system, with the major portion of it becoming nominally part of Qinghai province and a smaller portion becoming part of Gansu province. Due to the lack of a Chinese administrative presence in the region, however, most of the communities of the rural areas of Amdo and Kham remained under their own local, Tibetan lay and monastic leaders into the 1950s. Tibetan region of Lho-Jang and Gyarong in Kham, and Ngapa (Chinese Aba) and Golok in Amdo, were still independent of Chinese hegemony, despite the creation on paper of Qinghai Province in 1927.

The 14th Dalai Lama was born in the Amdo region, in 1935, and when he was announced as a possible candidate, Ma Bufang tried to prevent the boy from travelling to Tibet. He demanded a ransom of 300,000 dollars, which was paid and then he escorted the young boy to Tibet.

In May 1949, Ma Bufang was appointed Military Governor of Northwest China, making him the highest-ranked administrator of the Amdo region. However, by August 1949, the advancing People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) had annihilated Ma&#x27;s army, though residual forces took several years to defeat. By 1949, advance units of the PLA had taken much of Amdo from the Nationalists. By 1952, following the annexation of Tibet by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the major towns in the region were fully under the control of People&#x27;s Republic of China, though many of the rural areas continued to enjoy de facto autonomy for several more years. Tibetan guerrilla forces in Amdo emerged in 1956 and continued until the 1970s fighting the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

In 1958, Chinese communists assumed official control of Tibetan regions in Kham and Amdo. Many of the nomads of Amdo revolted. Some areas were reported virtually empty of men: They either had been killed or imprisoned or had fled. The largest monastery in Amdo was forced to close. Of its three thousand monks, two thousand were arrested.

In July 1958 as the revolutionary fervor of the Great Leap Forward swept across the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Zeku County in the Amdo region of cultural Tibet erupted in violence against efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to impose rapid collectivization on the pastoral communities of the grasslands. Rebellion also stirred the region at the beginning of the 1950s as “Liberation” first settled on the northeastern Tibetan plateau. The immediate ramifications of each disturbance both for the Amdo Tibetan elites and commoners, and for the Han cadres in their midst, elucidates early PRC nation-building and state-building struggles in minority nationality areas and the influence of this crucial transitional period on relations between Han and Tibetan in Amdo decades later.

As a prelude to the Beijing Olympics, protests broke out in 2008 in Amdo, among other places. Some were violent; however the majority were peaceful.

==Monasteries==
Amdo was traditionally a place of great learning and scholarship and contains many great monasteries including Kumbum Monastery near Xining, Rongwo Monastery in Rebgong, Labrang Monastery south of Lanzhou, and the Kirti Gompas of Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture and Taktsang Lhamo in Dzoge County.

From 1958 to 1962, the political climate in Amdo was considered unbearable. In 1958, the arrest and murder of the Tseten Monastery&#x27;s Khenpo Jigme Rigpai Nyingpo while incarcerated in Xining&#x27;s Nantan prison marked the beginning of the period.

==Traditional pastoral economy==
Amdo Tibetans&#x27; traditional lifestyle and economy are centered on agriculture. Depending on the region and environment Amdo Tibetans live in, they are either nomads (Drog pa) or farmers (Sheng pa). The economy of Amdo of has been constant throughout history and has changed little in the modern time. A typical family has two homes or bases: one for when they move up into the mountains with their animals in the summer for better grazing, and another down in the valleys where they weather harsh winters and grow fodder for their livestock in small agricultural fields. The families of some villages may make a shorter seasonal trek as their pasture may be nearby, and they may even migrate between homes each day.

==Local government==
As in Amdo and Kham, independent local polities were the traditional governing systems. In Amdo, communities of nomads, farmers, horse traders and monasteries were organized into these polities, which continued from the era of the Tibetan Empire. Varying in size from small to large, some were inherited while others were not, and both women and men were individual leaders of these polities.
&quot;Tsowas&quot;, consisting of groups of families, are the basic socio-cum-political organization. The Golok peoples, Gomé and Lutsang peoples arranged themselves in &quot;tsowas&quot;. A larger organisation is the &quot;sgar&quot;, translated as &#x27;encampment&#x27;, while larger still is the &quot;nangso&quot;, translated as &#x27;commissioner&#x27;. There were also kingdoms, such as Kingdom of Co ne (Choné). In 1624, for example, the Drotsang Nangso sponsored a monastery which was called the Drotsang Sargön; the monastery at Detsa Nangso was called the Detsa Gompa. Earlier in 1376, a Horse and Tea Trading Station was in Co né.

After the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s (PRC) was founded, communist administrators overlaid a series of larger Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures (TAP) on top of the existing county system, but only where Tibetans formed the majority of the population. This policy towards Tibetans, considered a &quot;minority nationality&quot; within their own country, was set down in the constitution of the PRC.

<text>Frank Sellick Calder (November 17, 1877 – February 4, 1943) was a British-born Canadian ice hockey executive, journalist, and athlete. 

Calder was the first president of the National Hockey League (NHL), from 1917 until his death in 1943. He also served as the last acting president of the NHL&#x27;s predecessor league, the National Hockey Association (NHA), and was instrumental in the transition from the NHA to the NHL, a transition made to expel a franchise owner. He presided over the expansion of the NHL from Canada into the United States, while at the same time fending off rivals to the NHL&#x27;s status as the premier North American ice hockey league.

==Early life==
Calder was born to Scottish parents in Bristol, England. He participated in many English sports as a youth, including rugby, cricket, handball, golf, and soccer. As a young man, he immigrated to Canada and became a teacher at a private school. Before leaving the United Kingdom, he flipped a coin to decide whether he should immigrate to Canada or to the United States.

He married a fellow teacher, Amelia Cole, and they had three sons and one daughter.

==Early career==
Calder worked as a sports editor at the &quot;Montreal Witness&quot;. From there, he moved to the &quot;Montreal Herald&quot; and &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;. After that, he passed the role of sports editor to Elmer Ferguson so that he could move on to take the financial editor&#x27;s chair, in which capacity he covered the Montreal Stock Exchange, Canada&#x27;s largest stock market at the time. He maintained his interest in sports, creating the Montreal School Rugby League. He was the secretary-treasurer of the Montreal Football (Soccer) Association in 1903 and remained in that position until at least 1911, when he represented the organization at the time of the founding of the Province of Quebec Football (Soccer) Association. He was elected a member of the executive committee of the PQFA in 1911 and 1912. Earlier he was a referee and had refereed the game between the Montreal All-Stars and the touring Corinthians from England in 1906.

==National Hockey Association==
On November 15, 1914, Calder was appointed secretary-treasurer of the National Hockey Association (NHA). 

In 1917, the NHA owners decided to drop Eddie Livingstone&#x27;s Toronto Blueshirts franchise and took his players. Frank Robinson, seeing he was as powerless as his predecessor Emmett Quinn was resigned as NHA president. At the time, Calder was the secretary-treasurer when Frank Robinson resigned as president of the NHA in 1917. Calder, the league secretary, saw an opportunity in the situation. He decided that the NHA owners allied against Livingstone needed someone to represent them, and, in effect, Calder was—at least for all practical purposes—the new president of the NHA. He arranged meetings between the NHA&#x27;s owners to figure out how to get rid of Livingstone, and decided to form a new league.

==National Hockey League==
The National Hockey League, in the NHA&#x27;s place. Calder was elected president of the new league, which was officially established on November 26, 1917.

Calder wielded his power as president with authority. One example of this authority occurred during the Hamilton Tigers strike in 1925. Rather than negotiate with the players, he suspended and fined them each $200.

In 1926, Calder first arranged a co-operation agreement with the new American Hockey Association (AHA), then broke it upon learning that Livingstone owned the Chicago Cardinals franchise. He declared that several Cardinals players belonged to the NHL&#x27;s Chicago franchise (the Black Hawks), or other teams, and arranged for the ouster of Livingstone from the AHA. Livingstone would give up on professional hockey and return to amateur hockey. When the AHA later attempted to play for the Stanley Cup, Calder declared it an &quot;outlaw league,&quot; but he happily accepted James E. Norris, who owned the AHA&#x27;s Chicago Shamrocks, into the NHL to bail out the struggling Detroit Cougars franchise. The Cougars were renamed the Detroit Red Wings upon Norris&#x27; acquisition of them.

Calder was adamant that minorities would not be restricted from participation in the NHL. During the 1927–28 season, upon hearing of the Boston Black Panthers, the first all-Black hockey team in the United States, he was reported to have remarked that, &quot;Pro hockey has no ruling against the colored man, nor is it likely to ever draw the line,&quot; a reference to the segregation in baseball.

Only one attempt to remove Calder as president of the NHL was made. This was in 1932–33, when Black Hawks owner Frederic McLaughlin circulated a letter to the NHL Board of Governors to remove him. The board rejected the motion.

Commencing with the 1932–33 season, Calder named the top rookie in the NHL. Starting in 1936–37, he convinced the NHL&#x27;s Board of Governors to let him buy a trophy to give annually to the league&#x27;s top rookie, and he did this until 1941–42. After Calder&#x27;s death, the trophy was made permanent as the Calder Memorial Trophy.

Calder received a silver service in 1937–38 for his 20 years as president of the NHL.

===Professional–amateur relations===
In February 1938, Calder terminated the NHL&#x27;s agreement with the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) which governed signing of amateur players. He met with W. G. Hardy of the CAHA after a player suspended by the NHL was registered by a CAHA team. The differences were not resolved and Calder told NHL teams that they could approach any junior player with a contract offer. A new agreement was reached in August 1938, where the CAHA agreed not to allow international transfers for players on NHL reserve lists, and the NHL agreed not to sign any junior players without permission. It stipulated that both organizations use the same playing rules, and recognize each other&#x27;s suspensions. Hardy then represented the CAHA at the joint rules committee to draft uniform rules with the NHL. A new professional-amateur agreement was signed by Calder in October 1940 to reimburse amateur teams for developing NHL players, and also applied to players sent to the Eastern Amateur Hockey League. The agreement included allowing the NHL to sign a limited number of junior age players. By January 1941, both Calder and Hardy agreed the organizations were at a &quot;perfect understanding&quot; and were co-operating closely.

==Death==
Calder was presiding over a meeting of the NHL&#x27;s Board of Governors on January 25, 1943, when he suffered a heart attack, followed by another in a Toronto hospital. On February 3 he felt well enough to travel and returned to Montreal the next day. However, he checked into Montreal General Hospital upon arrival and suffered another, fatal heart attack soon after. He is interred in the Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal.

==Honours and legacy==
Calder was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1947 as a builder. Two trophies in professional hockey are named for him: the Calder Memorial Trophy, given yearly to the NHL&#x27;s top rookie, and the Calder Cup, the championship trophy of the American Hockey League (AHL). Calder was also awarded the Order of Sport, marking his induction into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 2015.

<text>[[Maccabi World Union|Maccabi]] Tel Aviv Basketball Club (), known for sponsorship reasons as Maccabi Playtika Tel Aviv (), is a professional basketball club based in Tel Aviv, Israel. The team plays in the Israeli Basketball Premier League (the top tier of Israeli basketball), and internationally in the EuroLeague. Maccabi Tel Aviv is known as one of the best teams in Europe, having won 6 Euroleague titles since joining, and having sent numerous players to the NBA draft.

The club started in the mid-1930s, as part of the Maccabi Tel Aviv Sports Club, which had been founded in 1906.

With six EuroLeague championships (including the 2001 FIBA SuproLeague), one Adriatic League championship, 57 Israeli Basketball Premier League championships, 45 Israeli State Cup titles, and 11 Israeli League Cup titles, Maccabi has been the most successful basketball team in Israel, and is also one of the most successful basketball teams outside of North America. Players such as Tal Brody, Miki Berkovich, Jim Boatwright, Kevin Magee, Earl Williams, and Aulcie Perry; and more recently Derrick Sharp, Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Tal Burstein, Anthony Parker and Nikola Vujčić, have been among the elite of Europe&#x27;s basketball players.

==History==
The Israeli Basketball Super League started in 1954, and Maccabi Tel Aviv was the first champion. It has dominated the championship ever since, winning the title overal 57 times, including 23 consecutive titles (1970 and 1992). The team has also won the Israeli Basketball State Cup overall 45 times. Maccabi is considered Israel&#x27;s national sporting representative in the world.

From 1969 until 2008, Maccabi Tel Aviv was sponsored by Elite, Israel&#x27;s largest food company, and carried its name. Since July 2008, Maccabi has had a new sponsor – Electra. In 2015 they switched their sponsor once again, this time to fashion chain FOX.

Since 1963, the club&#x27;s home court has been the Yad Eliyahu Arena in Tel Aviv (later renamed &quot;Menora Mivtachim Arena&quot;). Originally an open-air court for 5,000 spectators, it is now a modern indoor arena with a capacity of 10,383.

Most Maccabi Tel Aviv head coaches have been former players of the club. Yehoshua Rozin was involved with the club for 40 years. Ralph Klein started as an 18-year-old player and later had several spells as a coach, and led the club to its first EuroLeague title in the 1977–78 season. Zvi Sherf played for Maccabi&#x27;s second team, and coached the team for three spells. Pini Gershon played in the Youth department and as a coach led Maccabi to three EuroLeague titles; in 2001, 2004, and 2005.

Maccabi Tel Aviv has always provided the senior Israel national basketball team with a large number of players. Five Maccabi players, headed by Avraham Shneur, were on the team that represented Israel in its first EuroBasket, in 1953 in Moscow.

Tanhum Cohen-Mintz was one of Europe&#x27;s top centers in the sixties, and was selected to the first FIBA European Selection European All-Star Team, which played in Madrid in 1964. Miki Berkowitz, Motty Aroesti, Lou Silver, and Eric Minkin played a major part in winning the silver medal at the 1979 EuroBasket in Torino. Doron Jamchy played 16 years for the Israel national team, and holds the record for appearances (191 international games) and points scored (3,515).

Maccabi Tel Aviv was the first Israeli club to enter the FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague), in the 1958 season. Since then, it has played over 600 games in European-wide competitions, and was the only Israeli club to play in a FIBA European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup (FIBA Saporta Cup) Final (1967 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup), and to win the European-wide top-tier level EuroLeague on six occasions (1977, 1981, *2001 FIBA SuproLeague, 2004, 2005, and 2014). Maccabi has played in 15 EuroLeague Finals (1977, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1987, 1988, 1989, 2000, *2001 FIBA SuproLeague, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2014). In 1994 Tel Aviv, and in 2004 in Tel Aviv, Maccabi organized the EuroLeague Final Four.

The first basketball game between an NBA and a FIBA team was held in 1978, in Tel Aviv. Maccabi Tel Aviv beat the defending NBA champion Washington Bullets, 98–97.

Maccabi Tel Aviv has played a record 18 times vs. NBA teams, and became the first European team to win on an NBA floor, when it beat the Toronto Raptors, 105–103, in 2005. It also beat the Phoenix Suns and Brooklyn Nets in 1984, to win a tournament in Tel Aviv.

== Through the decades ==

===1950s===
5 Israeli League championships, 3 Israeli Cups.

Early success in the Israeli League. Rivalry with Hapoel Tel Aviv begins.

===1960s===

5 Israeli League championships, 5 Israeli Cups.

Establishment as an elite club with FIBA European All-Stars, such as center Tanhum Cohen-Mintz. Fierce rivalry with home-town foes, Hapoel Tel Aviv.

Tal Brody came to Israel in 1966 from the United States, after having been drafted #12 in the 1965 National Basketball Association Draft, originally just to take one year out of his life to play for Maccabi Tel Aviv. Ralph Klein, Israel&#x27;s most successful coach at the time, said that up until the enthusiastic Brody&#x27;s arrival, Israelis had only viewed basketball as a fun game. But within a year, with his serious attitude and his inspirational commitment, Brody had inculcated his teammates with his view of basketball as a way of life. At his urging, the team doubled the number of practices it held every week.

To capitalize on Brody&#x27;s quickness and speed, the coach abandoned the team&#x27;s formerly slow pace, in favor of a fast-paced motion game, built around fast breaks. Brody was the most dominant player in the European-wide second tier level FIBA European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup (FIBA Saporta Cup) in the 1966–67 season. In 1967, he was named Israel&#x27;s Sportsman of the Year. The team made it through the first, second, and third rounds of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup&#x27;s (Saporta Cup) playoffs, and reached the Finals, finishing second in the league.

For the first time, the Israeli Prime Minister (Levi Eshkol), the Israeli Defense Forces Chief of Staff, and Knesset members came to games. Demand for tickets to games in the team&#x27;s 5,000-seat stadium was so high that they became exceedingly difficult to obtain.

===1970s===
1 FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague), 10 Israeli League championships, 8 Israeli Cups.

The rise to the top in Europe. The first EuroLeague championship in 1977 was soon followed by another finals appearance in 1980. Tal Brody was the captain of that Maccabi Tel Aviv team.

====1977 FIBA European Champions Cup: &quot;We are on the map!&quot;====

The year 1977 was the apex of the Cold War, and the Soviet Union was boycotting Israel. In the first round of the FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) Maccabi Tel Aviv defeated Real Madrid, 94–85. In the second round, it beat BC Brno, Czechoslovakian League, for the first time, 91–76, on 15 February 1977.

In the FIBA European Champions Cup semifinals, Maccabi Tel Aviv was matched against CSKA Moscow – the Red Army team. CSKA Moscow was a powerhouse. The Soviet Army team had won the prior USSR League championship. Six of its players had played on the Soviet national team that had defeated the United States in the 1972 Summer Olympics, and their captain was Sergei Belov. And the Communists were well known for using sports to glorify what they billed as their supremacy over the West.

The Soviet Union had broken off diplomatic relations with Israel a decade earlier, and politically and militarily backed Israel&#x27;s Arab enemies. For political reasons, therefore, CSKA Moscow refused to play in Tel Aviv. And the Soviets also refused to grant visas to the Israelis, to allow them to come play in Moscow. In the end, Maccabi Tel Aviv&#x27;s &quot;home game&quot; was played in the small, neutral town of Virton, Belgium.
The game took place in an emotional atmosphere. It was of huge symbolic value for Maccabi Tel Aviv fans, and for many Israelis who ordinarily had no interest in basketball. The game pitted the capitalist West against the Communist East, and Israel against the country that was supplying its enemies with weapons. The game also matched the country of Israel, with a total of a mere 4 million inhabitants, against the Soviets, with their 290 million people. The newspaper &quot;Maariv&quot; billed the 17 February 1977, game as &quot;the fight between David and Goliath.&quot; Most of Israel&#x27;s population watched the game, which was broadcast on Israel&#x27;s only TV channel at the time.

Maccabi Tel Aviv upset the heavily favored Soviets, 91–79. The feeling among Israelis was not only that CSKA Moscow had been defeated, but that a victory – albeit small – had been achieved against the mighty Soviet Union. The game has for decades been recognized as a key event in the forging of Israel&#x27;s national identity. Even decades later, it was being replayed repeatedly on Israeli television.

&quot;&quot;We are on the map!&quot; proclaimed a euphoric Tal Brody, in his heavily American-accented Hebrew, as a TV announcer pushed a microphone in front of him for a post-game quote, while people danced the hora around, him in excitement and celebration. &quot;And we are staying on the map – not only in sports, but in everything.&quot;&quot; The phrase &quot;We are on the map!&quot; (&quot;anachnu al hamapa, ve&#x27;anahnu nisharim al hamapa!&quot;), a literal translation of an English phrase into his adopted language, but a novel saying in Hebrew, became a new, popular phrase in Israel. It reflected a physical victory by the nascent Jewish Zionist idea, and national pride. It became Israel&#x27;s most famous quote, and a staple of Israeli speech.

Back home, hundreds of thousands of Israelis celebrated spontaneously in the streets, and 150,000 in Tel Aviv congregated in celebration in what is now Rabin Square. Many jumped into its fountain, splashing in water and champagne. Recalling the moment, an Israeli quoted in the book &quot;From Beirut to Jerusalem&quot; told author Thomas Friedman that on one level it was Brody the star basketball player and his teammates beating the Russians, but on another level it was &quot;my grandfather beating them. It was our retroactive victory over the Cossacks.&quot;

The FIBA European Champions Cup Finals were played in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, on 7 April 1977. Yugoslavia was a Non-Aligned country that supported Palestine, and with which Israel did not have diplomatic relations, and the El Al plane that brought the Maccabi Tel Aviv players over to it for the game, was the first Israeli plane ever allowed to land there.

The Israelis were pitted against the highly favored Mobilgirgi Varese, the champions of Italy&#x27;s top league. Mobilgirgi Varese had beaten the Israelis twice that year, and had beaten them in the European-wide second-tier level FIBA European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup (FIBA Saporta Cup) Finals, ten years earlier, when Brody first started playing for Maccabi Tel Aviv. Back in Israel, the entire country watched the game on television.

Maccabi Tel Aviv went on to defeat Mobilgirgi Varese by one point, 78–77, in the FIBA European Champions Cup Finals. Brody, as the team&#x27;s captain, received the FIBA European Cup trophy from FIBA&#x27;s Secretary General, and lifted it over his head. Jim Boatwright was the game&#x27;s leading scorer, with 26 points.

It was Israel&#x27;s first FIBA European Champions Cup title, in the 23-nation league. It was also the first time that Israel had won a championship of that caliber in any sport, and was, at the time, Israel&#x27;s greatest achievement in international sports. The victory greatly lifted the spirit and morale of the country. In Israel, 200,000 people gathered to celebrate in Israel&#x27;s National Park, and the event was celebrated as a national holiday. When the team returned home, it found 150,000 Israelis waiting for it.

===1980s===
1 FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague), 1 FIBA Intercontinental Cup, 10 Israeli League championships, 8 Israeli Cups.

A golden era of the Maccabi Tel Aviv ball club. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Maccabi dominated the Israeli Basketball Super League, winning all 20 league championships consecutively. Winning the FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) title in 1981, and reaching the FIBA European Champions Cup Finals for four more times, in 1982, 1987, 1988, and 1989. Miki Berkovich 1971–75, and 1976–88, Motti Aroesti 1974–88, Doron Jamchi 1985–96 and 1999–2000, Kevin Magee 1984–90, Lou Silver 1975–85, Ken Barlow 1987–90, Aulcie Perry 1976–85, and LaVon Mercer 1988–95 were the superstars of that Maccabi run.

====1981 FIBA European Champions Cup championship====
Maccabi Tel Aviv beat Sinudyne Bologna, 80–79, in the Finals game, in Strasbourg, under head coach Rudy D&#x27;Amico. It was proof that Maccabi was at the top of European professional club basketball for good.

===1990s===
9 Israeli League championships, 5 Israeli Cups.

For Maccabi Tel Aviv there was no European-wide title in the decade, and the team had struggles in European competitions. However, the club was still considered to be one of the European powerhouses of that era, as the club then featured European All-Stars such as Doron Jamchy and Oded Kattash, as well LaVon Mercer. With the exception of 1993, Maccabi absolutely dominated the Israel League, winning every championship.

===2000s===
3 EuroLeague championships, 9 Israeli League championships, 7 Israeli Cups, 1 Israeli League Cup.

The &quot;second golden era&quot; of Maccabi Tel Aviv, making it the second most successful European basketball club of that decade. Maccabi made it to the FIBA EuroLeague&#x27;s title game in 2000, which marked the start of Maccabi&#x27;s second &quot;golden era&quot;, the most successful of the club to date. During this decade, the club won three EuroLeague championships, in 2001 (FIBA SuproLeague), 2004, and 2005 respectively. They also reached the European title game on two more occasions, in 2006 and 2008. Ariel McDonald 1999–2002, Anthony Parker 2000–02 and 2003–06, Nate Huffman 1999–2002, Šarūnas Jasikevičius 2003–05, Maceo Baston 2003–06, Derrick Sharp 1996–2011, Nikola Vujčić 2002–08, and Tal Burstein 2000–09 and 2010–12 were the top players of Maccabi during this era.

====2001 FIBA SuproLeague championship====

The return to European glory for the club. This was the only year in European-wide professional club basketball history, with two recognized top-tier level European-wide champions, from two different organizations. Maccabi Tel Aviv was recognized as the winner of the traditional FIBA tournament, which had been renamed from the FIBA EuroLeague, to the FIBA SuproLeague; and Kinder Bologna, which was recognized as the champions of the newly established EuroLeague, which was organized by EuroLeague Basketball.

====2004 and 2005, back-to-back EuroLeague championships====
Maccabi Tel Aviv fans did not have to wait too much for another big title, as it all clicked in the 2003–04 season. Sharp&#x27;s miracle three-pointer to survive the EuroLeague Top 16 that year has become one of the classic shots in European basketball history, and is unforgettable for any Maccabi fan. Once in the 2004 EuroLeague Final Four, Maccabi turned in a record breaking performance, with an outstanding 118-point title game performance. Maccabi won back-to-back EuroLeague titles in 2005, becoming the first team to do so since 1991. The players Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Anthony Parker, Tal Burstein, Maceo Baston, and Nikola Vujčić, coached by Pini Gershon, became a classic lineup in European basketball history. This team of 2003–04 and 2004–05 is generally considered one of the best basketball teams in European club history, and certainly one of the most fun to watch ever in basketball history. After starting point guard &quot;Saras&quot; Jasikevičius left the team, to fulfill his lifelong dream and play in the NBA, Maccabi went back to the EuroLeague Final, in the 2005–06 season, but CSKA Moscow stood in the way of a three-peat. Anthony Parker and Maceo Baston left after that year, and returned home, signing multi-million dollar contracts with NBA teams. Center Nikola Vujčić stayed with Maccabi for two more years, playing in one more final, in the 2007–08 season, before leaving the team, and signing a multi-million dollar deal with Olympiacos. Israeli Super League legends Derrick Sharp and Tal Burstein, remained with Maccabi, and continued to play for the team until 2011 and 2012, respectively. Maccabi also dominated the Israel League, winning every tournament from 1993 to 2007, and winning multiple Cup tournaments.

===2010s===

1 EuroLeague Championship, 5 Israeli League championships, 8 Israeli Cups, 6 Israeli League Cups, 1 Adriatic League championship.

For the 2010–11 season, management brought back head coach David Blatt, and added new premier players. Maccabi Tel Aviv reeled off nine consecutive wins to finish the EuroLeague regular season. Highlights included David Blu&#x27;s game-winning triple against Khmki, Sofoklis Schortsanitis&#x27;s dominance inside, and the defense of steals leaders Chuck Eidson and Doron Perkins. The momentum ended with a road loss at Regal FC Barcelona, at the start of the EuroLeague Top 16, but Maccabi surged again with three straight wins to reach the EuroLeague playoffs. Barca handed Maccabi another loss, this time in Tel Aviv – the only home defeat of the season – and ended Blatt&#x27;s hopes for home-court advantage, in the next stage against Caja Laboral.

Maccabi Tel Aviv prevailed in the EuroLeague playoff series, as the injured Perkins&#x27; replacement in the starting lineup, Guy Pnini, set a single-game-career-high in scoring, along the way, and the team moved on to the 2011 Final Four. Jeremy Pargo finished with the best performance index rating, and the second-most points per game, among all playoffs participants. He also ranked among the top five players in three-pointers made, assists, and steals. Backup center Richard Hendrix was named MVP of the first round of the EuroLeague Playoffs, and finished as the overall playoff leader in rebounds and blocks. Maccabi Tel Aviv beat Real Madrid in the EuroLeague semifinals, 82–63, advancing to the EuroLeague Final game. On 8 May 2011, Maccabi lost the final game, 70–78, to Panathinaikos. With the exception of 2008 and 2010, Maccabi, up to 2011, also won every Israeli League from 1993.

Maccabi announced that it would join the Adriatic League for the 2011–12 season, joining the league for the second time, as it had also joined the league for the 2002–03 season, when it reached the League&#x27;s finals game. This was supposed to bridge the gap between the highest basketball level Maccabi engages in, in the EuroLeague, and the low-level Israeli league.

On 3 August 2011, NBA point guard Jordan Farmar of the New Jersey Nets signed a one-year contract with Maccabi Tel Aviv, in the wake of the 2011 NBA lockout. He played for the team during the lockout. It was reported on 14 November 2011, that Maccabi also agreed to terms with Israeli NBA small forward Omri Casspi, to join the team in several weeks. However, the end of the NBA lockout, and the 25 December 2011 start date for the 2011–12 season, brought Casspi and Farmar back from Tel Aviv, to join their NBA teams (Cleveland and Brooklyn, respectively).

Maccabi Tel Aviv ended the season winning four titles: the Israeli League Cup, the Israeli State Cup, the Israeli Super League, and the Adriatic League. In the 2012–13 season, Maccabi won the Israeli League Cup and the Israeli State Cup, and reached the EuroLeague playoffs, losing to Real Madrid 0:3. In the Israeli Super League, Maccabi suffered a huge disappointment, as they lost to Maccabi Haifa 79:86 in the finals.

====2014 EuroLeague championship====
In the 2013–14 EuroLeague season, Maccabi Tel Aviv finished first in their regular season group. The team went on to finish third in their top 16 group, leading to a best-of-5 playoff series against Emporio Armani Milano, without the home-court advantage.
In the first game, Maccabi stunned the hosts from Milano, by turning a 7-point deficit, with 30 seconds remaining on the clock, into a 101–99 overtime victory. Maccabi then won two home games, to win the series 3–1, and to secure its place in the 2014 EuroLeague Final Four.

In the EuroLeague semifinals, Maccabi came from behind to defeat the heavily favored CSKA Moscow, with a last-second basket, after CSKA had been up by 15 points late in the game. Tyrese Rice scored the game-winning lay-up, with 5.5 seconds to go.

Maccabi Tel Aviv head coach David Blatt admitted after the semifinal that Maccabi had overshot every possible expectation during the season. When asked if the sky was the limit, Blatt said that &quot;in this storm of a season, Maccabi long ago touched the sky, and reached the moon&quot;.

On 18 May 2014, Maccabi Tel Aviv won its sixth EuroLeague championship, after it defeated Real Madrid, by a score of 98–86, in overtime, to win the EuroLeague championship. Tyrese Rice was named the EuroLeague Final Four MVP. The game received worldwide media attention, after in response to Real Madrid&#x27;s loss to Maccabi, over 18,000 anti-Semitic messages were posted on Twitter, in an outpouring of hatred against Jews. Maccabi entered the EuroLeague Finals as an underdog, with few expecting the team to even make it into the EuroLeague Final Four, let alone to go all the way and win the championship.

Following the success of winning the EuroLeague championship, Maccabi Tel Aviv&#x27;s head coach David Blatt was hired to be the head coach of the NBA&#x27;s Cleveland Cavaliers. Blatt&#x27;s assistant, Guy Goodes was then appointed as his replacement at Maccabi.

====2014 FIBA International Cup====
After winning the 2014 Euroleague Championship, Maccabi Tel Aviv was invited by FIBA to play 2014 FIBA Intercontinental Cup against Brazil&#x27;s Flamengo, who won the 2014 FIBA Americas League. The two-game aggregate score tournament took place at the HSBC Arena in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 26–28 September 2014, to determine the champion. After beating Flamengo at the first game by 69–66, Maccabi lost the second game by 90–77. The aggregate score was 156–146, which made Flamengo the 2014 FIBA International Cup champion. Guy Goodes was Maccabi&#x27;s coach at these two games.

====2014–15 season====

Head coach David Blatt left Maccabi to coach the Cleveland Cavaliers. Assistant coach Guy Goodes was promoted to head coach. In the 2014–15 season, Maccabi Tel Aviv was defeated 2–3 in the Super League Semifinals by Hapoel Eilat. It was the first time in 22 years that Maccabi would not play in the Finals. In the EuroLeague, Maccabi lost in the playoffs to Fenerbahçe Ülker 0:3.

====2015–2017 Seasons: Downfall====
Starting from the 2015–16 season, the team was named Maccabi FOX Tel Aviv, referring to the new main fashion line sponsor. New players were signed, including some proven players such as Taylor Rochestie and Vítor Faverani. Jordan Farmar returned, and prospect Dragan Bender gained more playing time as well.

After a slow start in the EuroLeague (1–3) and Israeli League (3–2), head coach Goodes was sacked on 9 November 2015. On 14 November, Žan Tabak signed a deal to become the head coach of Maccabi. Tabak lead the team to an Israeli Cup victory. Maccabi Tel Aviv was eventually eliminated from the EuroLeague after the regular season, and played in the 2015–16 Eurocup Basketball Last 32 phase, but failed to qualify for the playoffs after a loss at home to BC Nizhny Novgorod. The Israeli League season proved to be a disaster, when Maccabi was eliminated in the semifinal for the second consecutive season, this time by the eventual champions in Maccabi Rishon LeZion. This started a three-year spell of not doing well in either league.

The 2016–17 season was even worse for Maccabi Tel Aviv. During the summer, solid players such as Sonny Weems and Andrew Goudelock were signed, in hopes that they would lead Maccabi back to glory. Erez Edelstein was named the head coach. However, the season began with difficulties in both the Israeli League, and with losses in the EuroLeague, and Edelstein was fired. Assistant Rami Hadar briefly served as coach, before resigning after a series of losses, and Maccabi hired Ainars Bagatskis, who served as David Blatt&#x27;s assistant in Darüşşafaka, as the new head coach. While Maccabi won the Israeli Cup with a win over rival Hapoel Jerusalem, in the EuroLeague, Maccabi finished in 14th place in the new format, while only finishing in 4th place in the Israeli League regular season. Bagatskis was fired just before the playoffs, with Arik Shivek becoming the new head coach for Maccabi. Maccabi made the 2017 Israeli Basketball Super League Final Four, but suffered a shocking loss to Maccabi Haifa in the semifinals, on the home Menora Mivtachim Arena floor. After the season, longtime player Devin Smith, with the team since the 2011–12 season, announced his retirement.

====2017–2020====
Neven Spahija returned to Maccabi Tel Aviv as the new head coach, having coached the team in the 2006–07 season. Forming a completely new team, Maccabi had a successful season – in the Euroleague, Maccabi fought for most of the season for a place in the playoffs, falling short only in the end, but finishing in 10th place, a huge improvement from the previous Euroleague seasons. In Israel, while Maccabi lost the Israeli State Cup for the first time since 2008, to Hapoel Holon, Maccabi won the Israel League Cup. In the Israeli League, Maccabi finished in 1st place in the regular season, and dominated in the playoffs, finishing by winning the 2018 Israeli Basketball Premier League Final Four, defeating Hapoel Tel Aviv 98:74 in the semifinals, and crushing Cup winner Hapoel Holon 95:75 in the finals, winning their first Israeli League since 2014. Alex Tyus was named the MVP.

For the 2018–19 season Maccabi Tel Aviv had high hopes. Coach Spahija started the season, but after four consecutive losses and a 1–6 start to the 2018–19 EuroLeague Season, Maccabi fired Spahija and hired Ioannis Sfairopoulos as the head coach. Maccabi improved, and nearly qualified for the Euroleague playoffs, though a few losses in the end prevented the team from qualification. Maccabi finished 10th. While Maccabi lost both Cup tournaments, they dominated the Israeli League – winning both 1st place in the regular season, and the 2019 Israeli Basketball Premier League Final Four tournament, held in Tel Aviv, to win the Israeli League for the second consecutive season, with John DiBartolomeo winning the MVP award.

===2020–present===
In the 2020–21 season, Maccabi Tel Aviv started off with no fans in attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel, and got off to a rocky start, winning 14 out of 34 Euroleague games. In the Winners League, Maccabi beat Hapoel Gilboa Galil to win the Israeli finals series 2–1, to win its 55th championship.

Through the summer of 2021, Maccabi signed Jalen Reynolds who had already played for the club, alongside James Nunnally and Derrick Williams.

Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the records of all regular season matches against Russian teams were annulled, and team won-loss records adjusted accordingly, dramatically affecting league standings. In the case of Maccabi Tel Aviv, it had lost three of four games against the Russian teams. 

Due to the Gaza war beginning October 2023, Maccabi played all home games at Aleksandar Nikolic Hall in Belgrade, Serbia for the 2023-24 EuroLeague season.

==Arena==
===Menora Mivtachim Arena===

Menora Mivtachim Arena in Tel Aviv with a capacity of 10,383 is the team&#x27;s arena since 1964.

=== Aleksandar Nikolić Hall===
Due to the events of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, The EuroLeague detractive board decided that Maccabi will host its’ “home” games in the Aleksandar Nikolić Hall in Belgrade, Serbia until all matters are resolved

<doc id="630207" wikidata="Q586959" url="?curid=630207" title="NHL commissioner">
<text>The National Hockey League commissioner () is the highest-ranking executive officer in the National Hockey League (NHL). The position was created in 1993; Gary Bettman was named the first commissioner and remains the only person to fill the position to date. Among other duties, the commissioner leads collective bargaining negotiations on behalf of the league and appoints officials for all NHL games.

Until 1993, the NHL&#x27;s top executive was the league president, and for five months in 1993, the league had both a commissioner and a president. The roles were amalgamated on July 1, 1993. The presidency originated in the National Hockey Association (NHA), which Frank Calder presided over jointly as NHA acting president and NHL president in the period of the NHL&#x27;s founding and the NHA&#x27;s suspension.

==Definition and duties==
According to the NHL Constitution, Article VI, section 6.1:

&quot;&quot;6.1 Office of Commissioner, Election and Term of Office&quot; The League shall employ a Commissioner selected by the Board of Governors. The Commissioner shall serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the League and is charged with protecting the integrity of the game of professional hockey and preserving public confidence in the League. The Board of Governors shall determine the term of office and compensation of the Commissioner. The Commissioner shall be elected a majority of the Governors present and voting at a League meeting at which a quorum was present when it was convened.&quot;

In Section 6.3, the commissioner&#x27;s duties are spelled out as having &quot;responsibility for the general supervision and direction of all business and affairs of the league&quot;, co-ordinates matters between member clubs and serves as the principal public spokesman for the league. The commissioner also has authority over dispute resolution, league committees, interpretation of league rules, appointment of league staff, NHL financial matters, contracting authority, scheduling, officials and disciplinary powers. The commissioner also determines the date and places of board of governors meetings.

==NHL presidents (1917–1993)==

===Frank Calder (1917–1943)===
Calder wielded his power as president with such authority that he was rarely opposed. When he ordered the Quebec Bulldogs franchise forfeited to Hamilton, as happened in 1920, no one challenged him. An example of his authority was when the Hamilton Tigers went on strike in 1925. Rather than talk to the players, he suspended and fined them $200 each.

Calder was adamant about not restricting racial minorities&#x27; entry into the NHL. During the 1927–28 season, upon hearing of the Boston Black Panthers, the first all-black hockey team, he was reported to have remarked, &quot;Pro hockey has no ruling against the coloured man, nor is it likely to ever draw the line&quot;, a reference to the segregation in baseball. Only one attempt to remove Calder as president of the NHL was made. This was in 1932–33 when the owner of the Chicago Black Hawks, Frederic McLaughlin, circulated a letter to the NHL board of governors to remove him. The board rejected the motion.

Commencing with the 1932–33 season, Calder named the top rookie in the NHL. Starting in 1936–37, he got the NHL&#x27;s board of governors to let him buy a trophy to give to the league&#x27;s top rookie and he did this until 1941–42. After his death, the trophy was made permanent as the Calder Memorial Trophy. Calder received a silver service in 1937–38 for his 20 years as president of the NHL and the league extended their appreciation.

===Red Dutton (1943–1946)===
Dutton was named managing director (acting president) of the NHL after the death of Frank Calder in February 1943, running the league at the direction of a subcommittee of the NHL Board of Governors. He was eventually convinced to assume the presidency in 1945, but in September 1946, amid frustrations with the Board of Governors for their cancellation of the suspended Brooklyn Americans franchise that he had sought to revive, he handed over the reins to his assistant, Clarence Campbell, a former NHL referee who had just returned from military service in Europe and had been in the job for less than a month.

===Clarence Campbell (1946–1977)===
One of Clarence Campbell&#x27;s first acts of authority was in 1948, when he expelled players Billy Taylor and Don Gallinger from the NHL for betting on games.

As NHL president, Campbell is perhaps best remembered for suspending Montreal Canadiens superstar Maurice Richard for the remaining three games of the 1955 regular season and for the entirety of the playoffs. His action came as a result of Richard&#x27;s punching of linesman Cliff Thompson during a March 13 game with the Boston Bruins (Thompson was holding Richard, allowing Boston&#x27;s Hal Laycoe to punch the Rocket). On March 17, Campbell attended a game at the Montreal Forum between the Canadiens and the Detroit Red Wings. Throughout the first period he was taunted and pelted with debris by outraged Montreal fans, who saw him as a prime example of the city&#x27;s English-Canadian elite oppressing the French-Canadian majority. After a tear gas bomb was released in the arena, Campbell exited the building, the game was forfeited to the Red Wings, and the Forum was evacuated. What ensued was a full-fledged riot in which 60 people were arrested and $500,000 in damage was done.

Campbell was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1966. He was instrumental in the 1967 expansion, which doubled the league in size. He kept the league alive when the World Hockey Association raided its talent in the 1970s, and often worked 18 hours a day in his office.

At the beginning of the league&#x27;s expansion era in 1967, the NHL clubs decided to highlight the achievements of the league president by donating the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl in his honour. When the league realigned into two conferences and four divisions in 1974, it further honoured Campbell by naming one of the two conferences after him, and awarding the Campbell Bowl to the conference&#x27;s regular-season (later playoff) champion. Although the Clarence Campbell Conference was renamed the Western Conference in 1993, the Campbell Bowl continues to be awarded to the conference&#x27;s playoff champion.

===John Ziegler (1977–1992)===
In 1977, John Ziegler became the fourth president of the NHL, succeeding Campbell. It was under Ziegler&#x27;s watch that the WHA disbanded in 1979, and the NHL absorbed four of its teams (the Edmonton Oilers, Quebec Nordiques, Hartford Whalers, and original Winnipeg Jets), and near the end of his tenure in 1991, the San Jose Sharks began play, returning the NHL to the Bay Area for the first time since 1975.

Also under Ziegler&#x27;s watch, NHL headquarters were moved from Montreal to New York City.

In 1987, Rendez-vous &#x27;87, a series between the Soviet national team and a team of stars from the NHL, was held in Quebec City. The two teams split the two-game series, and propelled an influx of Soviet players being drafted into the NHL by the end of the 1980s.

The first league-wide labor dispute occurred under Ziegler toward the end of the 1991–92 season. Ziegler was forced out of office by the owners as a result of the settlement that resolved the ten-day strike.

===Gil Stein (1992–1993)===
On June 22, 1992, Gil Stein was announced as the new president of the league and formally took the position, succeeding Ziegler. Ziegler had been forced out by owners dissatisfied with his agreement with the NHLPA, that ended a ten-day strike initiated by Bob Goodenow.

As president, Stein greatly expanded the visibility of the president&#x27;s office during his term, often seen at games and being frequently interviewed on air and in print. Among his early actions after becoming president was a shake-up of league officers, ousting several vice-presidents, including Brian O&#x27;Neill, who had been the league&#x27;s disciplinarian under Ziegler. Stein personally took over responsibility for league discipline, making it mandatory that suspended players pay their fines. He also implemented a policy of suspending players from practices on non-game days, instead of having them miss games. He advocated the use of NHL players at the 1994 Winter Olympics, but ran into opposition on the issue from team owners, however, his successor, Gary Bettman was able to get NHL players to compete in the Winter Olympics beginning in 1998, and the league would take a break during years when the Winter Olympics were held until 2018. Stein oversaw a further expansion of the NHL, in that the Tampa Bay Lightning and the &quot;new&quot; Ottawa Senators began play in the fall of 1992.

The league hired an executive search firm to help select someone for their newly created office of commissioner, at the same time that Stein&#x27;s appointment as president was announced. Before the end of 1992, NHL governors selected Gary Bettman to become the league&#x27;s first commissioner, starting on February 1, 1993. Stein had been a finalist for the job, but bowed out to avoid an internecine battle, and threw his support to Bettman.

When Stein&#x27;s term ended on July 1, 1993, the presidency was abolished and its duties were conferred onto the commissioner.

==NHL commissioners (1993–present)==

===Gary Bettman (1993–present)===
On February 1, 1993, Gary Bettman&#x27;s tenure as the first commissioner of the National Hockey League began. The owners hired Bettman with the mandate of selling the game in the U.S. markets, ending labour unrest, completing expansion plans, and modernizing the views of the &quot;old-guard&quot; within the ownership ranks.

====Expansion and relocation====
When Bettman started as commissioner, the league had already expanded by three teams to 24 since 1991, and two more were set to be announced by the expansion committee: the Florida Panthers and Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, who would begin play in 1993–94. Similar to the previous expansion cycles, the focus was on placing teams in the southern United States. The Nashville Predators (1998), Atlanta Thrashers (1999), Minnesota Wild (2000), Columbus Blue Jackets (2000), Vegas Golden Knights (2017) and the Seattle Kraken (2021) have been added during Bettman&#x27;s tenure. In addition, five franchises have relocated during Bettman&#x27;s tenure – the Minnesota North Stars to Dallas (1993), the Quebec Nordiques to Denver (1995), the original Winnipeg Jets to Phoenix (1996), the Hartford Whalers to North Carolina (1997) and the Atlanta Thrashers to Winnipeg (2011), while the Arizona Coyotes suspended operations in 2024 and a new team in Salt Lake City was established.

Led by Bettman, the league focused expansion and relocation efforts on the American South, working to expand the league&#x27;s footprint across the country. As a result, there has been significant growth in the sport of hockey at the grassroots level with children in the U.S. South playing the game in increasing numbers. The move towards southern markets has been heavily criticized as well, however, with fans in Canada and the Northern United States lamenting the move away from &quot;traditional hockey markets.&quot;

Bettman has also been accused of having an &quot;anti-Canadian&quot; agenda, with critics citing the relocation of the franchises in Quebec City and Winnipeg and his apparent refusal to help stop it, along with the aborted sale of the Nashville Predators in 2007 to interests that would have moved the team to Hamilton, Ontario. Jim Balsillie accused Bettman of forcing the Predators to end negotiations with him to purchase the team. Bettman was satirized in this vein as the character &quot;Harry Buttman&quot; in the 2006 Canadian movie &quot;Bon Cop, Bad Cop&quot;.

====Labour unrest====
Although Bettman was tasked with putting an end to the NHL&#x27;s labour problems, the league has nonetheless locked out its players three times during Bettman&#x27;s tenure. The 1994–95 lockout lasted 104 days, causing the season to be shortened from 84 to 48 games. A key issue during the lockout was the desire to aid small market teams. Led by Bettman, the owners insisted on a salary cap, changes to free agency and arbitration in the hopes of limiting escalating salaries, the union instead proposed a luxury tax system. The negotiations were at times bitter, with Chris Chelios famously issuing a veiled threat against Bettman, suggesting that Bettman should be &quot;worried about [his] family and [his] well-being&quot;, because &quot;Some crazed fans, or even a player [...] might take matters into their own hands and figure they get Bettman out of the way.&quot;

By the end of the deal in 2004, the owners were claiming that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues, and that the league as a whole lost over US$300 million in 2002–03.

As a result, on September 15, 2004, Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players out prior to the start of the 2004–05 season. Three months later, Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season with the words &quot;It is my sad duty to announce that because a solution has not yet been attained, it is no longer practical to conduct even an abbreviated season. Accordingly, I have no choice but to announce the formal cancellation of play for 2004–2005.&quot; The NHL became the first North American league to cancel an entire season because of a labour stoppage.

As in 1994, the owners&#x27; position was predicated around the need for a salary cap. In an effort to ensure solidarity amongst the owners, the league&#x27;s governors voted to give Bettman the right to unilaterally veto any union offer as long as he had the backing of just eight owners. The players initially favoured a luxury tax system, and a 5% rollback on player salaries — later increased to 24%. As the threat of another season being canceled loomed, the players agreed to accept a salary cap.

====Television====
Bettman quickly accomplished one of his stated goals, signing a five-year, $155 million deal with the Fox Broadcasting Company to broadcast NHL games nationally beginning in the 1994–95 season. The deal was significant, as a network television contract in the United States was long thought unattainable during the presidency of John Ziegler. The Fox deal is perhaps best remembered for the FoxTrax puck, which while generally popular according to Fox Sports, generated a great deal of controversy from longtime fans of the game.

Canadians were also upset as the league gave preference to Fox ahead of CBC for scheduling of playoff games, as Pat Hickey of the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; wrote that the schedule was &quot;just another example of how the NHL snubs its nose at the country that invented hockey and its fans.&quot; The controversy repeated itself in 2007, as the CBC was once again given second billing to Versus&#x27; coverage of the playoffs.

Despite falling ratings, Bettman negotiated a five-year, $600 million deal with ABC and ESPN in 1998. It was the largest television contract the NHL ever signed. The $120 million per year that ABC and ESPN paid for rights dwarfed the $5.5 million that the NHL received from American national broadcasts in 1991–92.

The NHL&#x27;s television fortunes have faded since the ABC deal, however. In 2004, the league could only manage a revenue sharing deal with NBC, with no money paid up front by the network. Also, coming out of the lockout, ESPN declined its $60 million option for the NHL&#x27;s cable rights in 2005–06. While wishing to retain the NHL, it stated the cost was overvalued. However, Bettman was able to negotiate a deal with Comcast to air the NHL on the Outdoor Life Network, which changed its name to Versus to reflect their increasing live sports coverage, and was once again renamed to NBC Sports Network as a result of Comcast acquiring a majority of NBCUniversal. The three-year deal was worth $207.5 million. Bettman has been heavily criticized for the move to OLN/Versus/NBC Sports, as detractors have argued that the league has lost a great deal of exposure since moving to the much smaller network, which is often relegated to higher or specialty tiers on cable systems. In 2011, the NHL and NBC announced a 10-year, $2 billion contract.

On November 26, 2013, Bettman and NHL announced that it had sold twelve seasons&#x27; worth of exclusive Canadian national broadcast rights to Rogers Media, who would broadcast games across its numerous platforms, including Sportsnet, Sportsnet One, and City, from at a price of C$5.2 billion. &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; would continue on the CBC for the next four seasons, but under a sub-licensing deal the public broadcaster would give Rogers free airtime to air the broadcasts. CBC would be allotted time during the broadcasts to promote its other programming. These moves left Bell Media and its TSN networks shut out of NHL broadcasts except for its regional properties.

<text>A steel roller coaster is a type of roller coaster classified by its steel track, which consists of long steel tubes that are run in pairs, supported by larger steel columns or beams. Trains running along the track typically rely on wheels made of polyurethane or nylon to keep each train car anchored to the track. The introduction of tubular steel drastically changed roller coaster innovation, allowing for greater speeds, higher drops, and more intense elements such as inversions.

Arrow Dynamics is credited with inventing tubular steel track and introducing the first modern steel coaster with the opening of Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland in 1959. Older steel-tracked coasters existed previously in a simpler form, such as Little Dipper at Memphis Kiddie Park in Brooklyn, Ohio, which is the oldest operating steel coaster in North America. The oldest in the world is Montaña Suiza at Parque de Atracciones Monte Igueldo (Spain), which has been operating since 1928.

==Characteristics==

*Steel coasters can generally provide a smoother ride experience than their wooden counterparts, and due to their strength, can have more complex ride elements, achieve greater speeds, and feature higher drops. Despite the advantages, wooden roller coasters continue to be built and still remain popular in the industry for providing a different riding experience.
*Most world records for height, speed, and length are typically held by steel roller coasters.
*Some designs combine steel tracks with wooden frames, or vice versa, which are referred to as hybrid roller coasters. In some cases, the original wooden track on a wooden coaster is retrofitted with steel track during a refurbishment, with one of the first being New Texas Giant at Six Flags Over Texas. One of the most popular conversions was Steel Vengeance at Cedar Point.

There are various types of steel coaster models and designs, including flying, inverted, floorless, and suspended.

<text>Radio Service Software (RSS) is a software package used to program commercial Motorola two-way radios and cellular telephones. An update of RSS is CPS, a Windows-based version of the package used for some of Motorola&#x27;s newer radio models. Radios are connected to PCs via the serial port, and proprietary programming cables. The use of genuine Motorola OEM programming cables is strongly suggested, as aftermarket brands are not as reliable and could lead to radio damage. 

==Licensing==
RSS (the Carrier and Super Agent forms) is available to authorized professionals from Motorola. The license does not permit resale of the software.

Unauthorized possession and use of RSS can lead to criminal charges and prosecution, as well as legal action by Motorola.
In September 1999, Motorola alleged unauthorised use of this software as part of a case involving sale of non-US Motorola 2-way radios in the US.
On July 17, 2000, Motorola filed a lawsuit against five individuals accused of selling copies of RSS through eBay.

<doc id="630213" wikidata="Q3105557" url="?curid=630213" title="Gil Stein (ice hockey)">
<text>Gilbert Stein (January 11, 1928 – March 24, 2022) was an American lawyer, law instructor, and professional ice hockey executive. Stein served with the National Hockey League (NHL) as vice president and legal counsel for nearly 15 years before serving as the fifth and last president of the NHL from 1992 to 1993.

==Early life and career==
Born in Philadelphia on January 11, 1928, Stein attended Temple University and studied law at Boston University. Before joining the NHL, Stein was Deputy District Attorney for Philadelphia, then worked for the Philadelphia Housing Authority and Labor Relations Board. After leaving the public sector, he joined a law firm, and then was hired by the Philadelphia Flyers where he served as chief operating officer and executive vice president.

===NHL===
He served as the National Hockey League&#x27;s (NHL) general counsel and vice president under John Ziegler, Jr., and held that role for 15 years. In 1982, he appeared before a United States Senate committee to discuss retransmission of television signals by cable operators.

After the owners disliked the way that Ziegler handled the 1991–92 NHL strike, they desired to abolish the position of president in favor of having a commissioner. He was appointed as interim president in June 22, 1992 and became full president on September 30. After taking over from Ziegler, Stein fired Brian O&#x27;Neill, the longtime overseer of league discipline, and took over the position himself. Stein then instituted a policy of suspending players on non-game days (such as practice) rather than games for violent actions. Stein also attempted to block O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s Hall of Fame candidacy by removing him from the board of members for the Hall (O&#x27;Neil was later elected in 1994). 

Stein also supported having NHL Players in the 1994 Winter Olympics as a way to grow NHL support in Europe. Two expansion teams came in the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Florida Panthers during his tenure. The announcement of the Panthers attracted the ire of Phil Esposito, president and general manager of the young Tampa Bay Lightning (who began play one year before Florida in 1992), as Stein initially told Esposito that no teams would be added until 1996, as the Lightning were supposed to have time to develop a fanbase in the state of Florida. Esposito criticized Stein for going after expansion fees without regard to the long-term implications of franchise stability. 

Stein served as NHL president for a year until shortly after the owners appointed Gary Bettman to the newly created post of commissioner. Bettman took office on February 1, 1993; Stein served alongside Bettman until his term as president ended on July 1, 1993. He was then appointed a special advisor to Bettman. In 1993, Stein was awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy for outstanding service to hockey in the United States. 

Stein was behind the Hall of Fame board while president, spearheading a change in the voting process by simple majority with no secret ballots. Stein was selected as the first member of this policy to the Hall of Fame, which attracted allegations that he manipulated his induction; the Board did not speak with either the Board of Governors (headed by Bruce McNall, a friend of Stein) or Bettman, and Stein ultimately resigned his nomination and from the League. Along with Alan Eagleson, Stein is one of two people ever removed from the Hockey Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Stein was married to Barbara and they had three children. In his later years, he lived in an assisted living community in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania. Stein died from heart disease on March 24, 2022, at the age of 94.

<text>Clarence Sutherland Campbell, (July 9, 1905 – June 24, 1984) was a Canadian ice hockey executive, referee, and soldier. He refereed in the National Hockey League (NHL) during the 1930s, served in the Canadian Army during World War II, then served as the third president of the NHL from 1946 to 1977. His tenure as president included the Richard Riot and the 1967 NHL expansion. His career was recognized with induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1966, and the naming of the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl for him.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Born in Fleming, Assiniboia District, North-West Territories, Campbell attended high school at the Strathcona Collegiate Institute, now known as Old Scona Academic, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. He graduated from the University of Alberta with a degree in law and arts in 1924 and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, where he played for the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club.

Campbell was an executive member of the Alberta Amateur Hockey Association in the 1930s, and was part of a Canadian Amateur Hockey Association committee in 1935 to study the definition of an amateur hockey player and updates needed.

Campbell worked as a referee in the NHL from 1933 until 1939. He officiated some historic games, such as the game in 1937 when the great Howie Morenz&#x27;s career was ended when he broke his leg, an injury that eventually led to his death. Campbell even refereed a rough playoff game between the Montreal Maroons and the Boston Bruins in which Dit Clapper used his stick on a player. Angry at Clapper&#x27;s actions, he called Clapper a profane name, which brought a powerful punch from the hardrock defenceman that knocked Campbell to the ice. Campbell, aware of his provocative action, then submitted a very lenient report on Clapper, and NHL president Frank Calder gave Clapper only a fine as a result.

Campbell made a controversial call in 1939 when refereeing a game involving the Toronto Maple Leafs when defenceman Red Horner was struck with a stick and Campbell doled out only a minor penalty, even though Horner was bleeding. Leafs owner Conn Smythe called for Campbell not to be rehired, and the league agreed.

===The heir apparent===
League president Frank Calder decided to let Campbell work in his office after his career as a referee, and it was becoming evident that the president was grooming a successor. But World War II broke out and Campbell enlisted in the Canadian Army. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1945. At the end of the war he served with the No. 1 Canadian War Graves Investigation Unit. After the war he was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel, and was one of the prosecutors at one of several trial courts of leading Nazis who were put on trial for crimes against humanity. It has been widely reported that Campbell participated in the Nuremberg Trials, but he said that was untrue in a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article published in 1974.

Meanwhile, Calder had died, and with Campbell overseas, the NHL named Red Dutton president. Dutton did not want the job, however, and when Campbell returned to Canada in 1946, Dutton resigned and Campbell accepted the presidency. One of his first acts of authority was in 1948, when he expelled players Billy Taylor and Don Gallinger from the NHL for betting on games.

===League president===
As NHL President, Campbell is perhaps best remembered for suspending Montreal Canadiens superstar Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard for the remaining three games of the 1955 regular season and for the entirety of the playoffs. This decision came about as a result of Richard&#x27;s actions during a March 13 game between the Canadiens and Boston Bruins; Richard had gotten into a vicious stick-swinging fight with the Bruins&#x27; Hal Laycoe, and when linesman Cliff Thompson restrained Richard, Laycoe punched Richard repeatedly. One of Richard&#x27;s teammates knocked down Laycoe, allowing Richard to turn around and punch Thompson in the face. On March 17, Campbell attended a game at the Montreal Forum between the Canadiens and the Detroit Red Wings. Throughout the first period he was taunted and pelted with debris by outraged Montreal fans, who saw him as a prime example of the city&#x27;s English-Canadian elite oppressing the French-Canadian majority. After a tear gas bomb was released in the arena, Campbell exited the building, the game was forfeited to the Red Wings, and the Forum was evacuated. What ensued was a full-fledged riot in which 60 people were arrested and $500,000 in damage was done.

Campbell was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1966. He was instrumental in the 1967 expansion, which doubled the league in size, and often worked 18 hours a day in his office.

At the beginning of the league&#x27;s Expansion Era in , the NHL clubs decided to highlight the achievements of the league president by donating the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl in his honour. When the league realigned into two conferences and four divisions in 1974, it further honoured Campbell by naming one of the two conferences after him, and awarding the Campbell Bowl to the conference&#x27;s regular-season (later playoff) champion. Although the Clarence Campbell Conference was renamed the Western Conference in 1993, the Campbell Bowl continues to be awarded to the conference&#x27;s playoff champion.

===Later life===
In 1976, Campbell was charged with bribing Senator Louis Giguère in the &quot;Sky Shops&quot; scandal. He was convicted, but the NHL paid his fine and he served no time because of his age. Campbell was a sick man by the time he retired as NHL president in 1977, succeeded by John Ziegler Jr.. He spent the last years of his life plagued with respiratory ailments, and died on June 24, 1984. He was interred at the National Field of Honour in Pointe-Claire, Quebec.

<text>Norman Alexander Dutton (July 23, 1897 – March 15, 1987) was a Canadian ice hockey player, coach and executive. Commonly known as Red Dutton, and earlier by the nickname &quot;Mervyn&quot;, he played for the Calgary Tigers of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) and the Montreal Maroons and New York Americans of the National Hockey League (NHL). A rugged and physical defenceman, Dutton often led his team in penalty minutes, won the WCHL championship in 1924 as a member of the Tigers and was twice named a WCHL All-Star.

Dutton coached and managed the Americans, and later purchased the team before suspending operations in 1942 due to World War II. He served as the second president of the NHL between 1943 and 1946 before resigning the position after the NHL&#x27;s owners reneged on a promise to allow the Americans to resume operations following the war. He served as a Stanley Cup trustee for 37 years but otherwise limited his involvement with the NHL following the Americans&#x27; demise. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958.

A successful businessman, Dutton operated a construction company that built Calgary&#x27;s McMahon Stadium in 1960 and he served for a time as the president of the Calgary Stampeders football club and later the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede. He was invested as a member of the Order of Canada in 1981 and is honoured by both the Manitoba Hockey and Alberta Sports Halls of Fame. He was posthumously awarded the Lester Patrick Trophy in 1993 in recognition of his contributions to the game of hockey in the United States.

He was the last surviving former player of the Calgary Tigers.

==Early life==
Dutton was born in Russell, Manitoba on July 23, 1897. His father, Bill, was a successful contractor who helped build Canada&#x27;s transcontinental railway system, and the younger Dutton often helped his father at his work when he was a boy. He had at least two elder brothers, and a sister.

His given name was Norman Alexander Dutton, but his birth names were quickly ignored. A family friend of the Duttons refused to call him Norman as the name had a negative connotation for her, so she instead called him &quot;Mervyn&quot;, a name that stuck. His friends called him &quot;Red&quot; after the colour of his hair, and to most, he was known as Mervyn &quot;Red&quot; Dutton.

Dutton attended school at St. John&#x27;s College in Winnipeg. He left school in 1915 to volunteer with the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) in World War I and served with the Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry. He lied about his birth date on his CEF enlistment papers as he was not yet 18, and served for four years. Dutton fought in the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917 where he suffered a shrapnel wound to his leg serious enough that doctors pressed for amputation. Dutton refused and spent the following 18 months working to recover full use of his leg. He played hockey almost constantly to regain strength, at one point playing in seven different Winnipeg leagues at the same time.

Following the war, Dutton sought to build his own contracting business. However, an economic depression in 1920 forced its closure. He then worked in a packing plant in Winnipeg that also ceased operations. Penniless, with only his pride preventing him from asking his father for help, he was met by the owner of a hockey team in Calgary who had sought him out. Dutton was offered $2,500 to play in the Alberta city.

==Playing career==

Dutton joined the Calgary Canadians of Alberta&#x27;s Big-4 League for the 1920–21 season, then moved onto the Calgary Tigers of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) in 1921–22 where he scored 16 goals and 21 points in 22 games. Two seasons later, in 1923–24, Dutton and the Tigers won the WCHL championship. He assisted on the championship winning goal in a 2–0 victory over the Regina Capitals by carrying the puck the length of the ice before passing to Cully Wilson who scored. The team then defeated the Pacific Coast Hockey Association&#x27;s Vancouver Maroons before losing to the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 1924 Stanley Cup Finals.

Named a WCHL first team all-star on defence in 1922 and 1923, Dutton played five seasons for the Tigers. Known for his aggressive, physical style, he led the team in penalty minutes in each of those five years, and the league in 1921–22 and 1923–24. Financial pressures forced the Western League to sell its interests to the NHL following the 1925–26 season, and having suffered a serious knee injury during the season, Dutton was left unsure of his future.

Nonetheless, his rights were sold to the Montreal Maroons, and he made his NHL debut on November 20, 1926 against the Canadiens. Dutton played four seasons with the Maroons, scoring 15 goals and 41 points. He played in the Stanley Cup Finals for the second time in his career in 1927–28, but the Maroons lost the best-of-five Stanley Cup Finals three games to two. He led the league in penalty minutes the following season.

Dutton was the subject of trade talks between the Maroons and the Chicago Black Hawks following the 1928–29 NHL season. The teams had been negotiating to send Cyclone Wentworth to Montreal in exchange for Dutton and Babe Siebert before the Black Hawks purchased the contract of Taffy Abel, which ended the Hawks pursuit of Dutton. The Maroons continued to make him available, with the Toronto Maple Leafs showing interest following the 1929–30 season. Finally, he was sold to the New York Americans along with Mike Neville, Hap Emms and Frank Carson for $35,000.

At first distraught at leaving Montreal, Dutton quickly adapted to playing in New York. He maintained his aggressive style of play with the Americans, again leading the league in penalties in 1931–32. Despite his fiery temper, Dutton became one of the most popular players in New York amongst both the fans and his fellow players. He was not able to turn the Americans&#x27; fortunes on the ice around, however, as the team failed to qualify for the playoffs in his first five seasons with the team.

Dutton was named the coach of the Americans for the 1935–36 NHL season, and in doing so became the second player-coach in NHL history. Under his leadership, the Americans finished third in the Canadian Division with a 16–25–7 record and qualified for the postseason. The Americans then went on to defeat the Black Hawks 7–5 in a two-game, total-goal series to face the Maple Leafs in the league semi-final series. Dutton was unable to play parts of the series against Toronto due to a hip injury, and the Americans lost the best-of-three series two games to one. Dutton retired as a player following the season and turned his focus to coaching full-time.

==Executive career==
While Dutton focused on coaching the team, the Americans were facing bankruptcy. Heavily in debt, team owner Bill Dwyer turned to Dutton who lent him $20,000 to allow the team to continue operating. When the NHL finally forced Dwyer out and took over ownership of the franchise, the league asked Dutton to take over management of the team.

Though the ownerless team was written off by the press and labelled as being &quot;orphans&quot;, Dutton built an Americans team in 1937–38 that finished with a 19–18–11 record. It was only the third time in the team&#x27;s 13-year history they finished with a winning record. It was also only the third time the Americans qualified for the playoffs. They faced, and defeated, their rival New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs before losing to the Black Hawks in the league semi-final. Dutton pioneered the use of air travel as the Americans became the first hockey team to fly between games in 1938.

The Americans continued to defy expectations in 1938–39. They again qualified for the playoffs, losing to Toronto in the first round, while Dutton was named an NHL Second-Team All-Star as coach. He led them to the playoffs again in 1939–40, but the loss of players due to World War II took its toll on the franchise. After finishing in last place the season before, the league announced that the Americans had suspended operations for the 1942–43 NHL season, though Dutton continued to represent the team on the Board of Governors. Dutton believed that if the Americans could have held on through the war, his team would become more popular than the Rangers. &quot;A couple of more years and we would have run the Rangers right out of the rink,&quot; he said.

Following the sudden death of Frank Calder in 1943, the NHL asked Dutton to serve as acting president of the league. The owners wanted Dutton in the post both because he was popular with the players, and because they felt they could control him. Dutton agreed to take the presidency on the promise that the league would reinstate the Americans following the war. He resigned the position after one year, citing the fact that the role took too much time away from his business interests in Calgary, but reversed his decision on the understanding that he would not always be available to serve the NHL post. Despite this agreement, he again attempted to resign in December 1944, and again had to be persuaded to complete the season. On both occasions of his potential resignation, Canadian Amateur Hockey Association executives W. G. Hardy and George Dudley were rumoured as likely replacements.

In spite of his earlier reluctance to retain the presidency, Dutton signed a five-year agreement to remain as NHL president in 1945. He continued to make inquiries on the status of his team, but found in 1946 that the owners had reneged on their promise and cancelled the franchise. Dutton had arranged $7 million in financing for a new arena in Brooklyn. When the owners told him during a league meeting that they were not interested, Dutton told his peers &quot;You can stick your franchise up your ass&quot;, and left the meeting. Dutton then resigned the presidency, but remained in the position until he convinced the league to accept Clarence Campbell as his replacement.

Dutton felt that the Rangers were responsible for the league&#x27;s refusal to allow the Americans to resume operations, and in a fit of pique, swore that the Rangers would never win another Stanley Cup in his lifetime. His vow became known as &quot;Dutton&#x27;s Curse&quot;. Additionally, he never set foot in an NHL arena again until 1980 when, as the last surviving Calgary Tiger, he was asked to drop the puck for the ceremonial faceoff prior to the first game in Calgary Flames&#x27; history. Dutton&#x27;s 34-year separation from the NHL was attributed to the betrayal of the league&#x27;s owners, but also because Dutton himself found the lure of the game too strong, and knew he had to step away in order to effectively manage his businesses.

Dutton served as governor of the Western Canada Junior Hockey League from 1948 to 1951, when he was succeeded by Al Pickard.

In spite of this, he accepted a nomination in 1950 to become one of two Stanley Cup trustees, a position he held until his death in 1987. Dutton was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958, and was a member of the Hall of Fame&#x27;s selection committee for 15 years.

==Business career==
Attempting to overcome the failure of his first contracting business following World War I, Dutton operated a second using the money he earned with the Tigers and Maroons. It too failed in 1933 as a result of the Great Depression. In 1938, he tried again, joining with Reg Jennings and his brother Jack to form the Standard Gravel and Surfacing Company in Calgary. The company proved immensely successful during World War II, building numerous airports within Canada as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan as well as completing highways in northern Alberta and the Northwest Territories. After serving a year as vice-chairman, Dutton was named the chairman of the prairie roadbuilders section of the Canadian Construction Association in 1950. By 1960, the company had become Standard Holdings Ltd., operating 20 different companies that had $70 million in contracts for that year alone, and Dutton had personally become a millionaire.

He remained active in the sporting world as well. When the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League found themselves in financial trouble in 1955, Dutton led a group of local businessmen in purchasing the team. Named the president of the team, he worked to increase the team&#x27;s revenues and to force a greater level of professionalism amongst his peers in Canadian football. He served as team president until 1959.

Dutton&#x27;s company built the Chinook Centre shopping mall, and in 1960, was contracted to build McMahon Stadium as the new home of the Stampeders. He bet George McMahon, the stadium&#x27;s benefactor, $1,000 that he could complete the 19,000 seat facility within four months. He won the bet with three days to spare.

Also in 1960, Dutton was named president of the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede on a two-year term. He had been a Stampede director for ten-years previous to his appointment. As head of the exhibition, he also spoke for the Stampeders hockey team of the Western Hockey League, and was its chief negotiator. Through his work and community spirit, Dutton played a major role in helping Calgary and the surrounding area shed its rural image in the 25 years following World War II.

==Personal life==
Dutton and his wife Mory had four children: sons Joseph, Alex, and Norman, and daughter Beryl. All three sons fought in World War II; Joseph and Alex were both killed serving with the Royal Canadian Air Force within six months of each other. In their memory, he funded the Dutton Memorial Arena in Winnipeg which opened in 1967 and was dedicated to developing Canada&#x27;s national hockey team. Norman served in the navy during World War II; he died in 1973.

Dutton raced thoroughbred horses for decades, and once sponsored a baseball team made up of hockey players known as the Calgary Puckchasers that enjoyed success during the hockey off-seasons. Among his humanitarian efforts, Dutton was a longtime supporter of cancer research and treatment, and made donations of equipment in the memory of his father, who died from the disease. He became the potentate of the Al Azhar Shriner Temple in Calgary in 1953 so that he could help crippled children.

Dutton earned many honours in recognition of his life and career. He was made an honorary Lieutenant-Colonel of the King&#x27;s Own Calgary Regiment in 1953, and promoted to honorary Colonel two years later. In 1972, the newly built Red Dutton Arena in Springbank, Alberta (just west of Calgary) was named after him. He was invested as a member of the Order of Canada in 1981. In 1993, the NHL posthumously named him one of four recipients of the Lester Patrick Trophy in recognition of his contributions to hockey in the United States. He was inducted into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame in 1998, and the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.

<text>Chongzhen (; 5 February 1628 – 25 April 1644) was the era name (&quot;nianhao&quot;) of the Chongzhen Emperor, the last emperor of the Ming dynasty. It was also the final era of the Ming, lasting for 17 years.

In 1622 (Tianqi 2), Zhu Youjian was created the Prince of Xin (信王) by his elder brother, the Tianqi Emperor. In 1627 (Tianqi 7), the Tianqi Emperor died, and Zhu Youjian ascended to the throne. The Grand Secretariat proposed four era names—&quot;Qiansheng&quot; (乾聖), &quot;Xingfu&quot; (興福), &quot;Xianjia&quot; (咸嘉), and &quot;Chongzhen&quot; (崇貞)—for Zhu Youjian to choose from. He ultimately chose &quot;Chongzhen&quot; (崇貞). Another account states that the four proposed era names were &quot;Yongchang&quot; (永昌), &quot;Shaoqing&quot; (紹慶), &quot;Xianning&quot; (咸寧) and &quot;Chongzhen&quot; (崇貞), and Zhu Youjian chose &quot;Chongzhen&quot; and changed the character &quot;貞&quot; to &quot;禎&quot;. The following year (1628), the era was changed to Chongzhen.

In February 1644 (Chongzhen 17, 2nd month), Li Zicheng established the Shun dynasty in Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi, with the era name &quot;Yongchang&quot; (永昌). On 25 April 1644 (19th day of the 3rd month), the Shun army captured Beijing, the capital of the Ming dynasty. The Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide by hanging himself on the Coal Hill in Beijing (present-day Jingshan, Beijing), leading to the downfall of the Ming. After hearing the news, Zhu Yousong, Prince of Fu, ascended the throne in Nanjing, the temporary capital, on 19 June of the same year (15th day of the 5th month), as the Hongguang Emperor, and established the Southern Ming regime. He continued to use the Chongzhen era name until the end of the year on New Year&#x27;s Eve of Chongzhen 17, and the following year, the era was changed to Hongguang.

After the fall of the Ming dynasty, the Korean Yi dynasty aristocrats, out of anti-Qing sentiment and Little China ideology, still used the Chongzhen era name in their country, which was known as the &quot;Chongzhen jiyuan&quot; or &quot;Sungjeong giwon&quot; (崇禎紀元).

==Change of era==
* 5 February 1628 (Tianqi 8, 1st day of the 1st month): The era was changed to Chongzhen 1 (崇禎元年, &quot;the first year of Chongzhen&quot;).

<doc id="630226" wikidata="Q3123490" url="?curid=630226" title="Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area">
<text>The geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area includes nine known exposed formations, all visible in Zion National Park in the U.S. state of Utah. Together, these formations represent about 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation in that part of North America. Part of a super-sequence of rock units called the Grand Staircase, the formations exposed in the Zion and Kolob area were deposited in several different environments that range from the warm shallow seas of the Kaibab and Moenkopi formations, streams and lakes of the Chinle, Moenave, and Kayenta formations to the large deserts of the Navajo and Temple Cap formations and dry near shore environments of the Carmel Formation.

Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau slowly raised these formations much higher than where they were deposited. This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral rivers and other streams on the plateau. The faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks to remove all Cenozoic-aged formations and cut gorges into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. Lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area during the later part of this process.

Zion National Park includes an elevated plateau that consists of sedimentary formations that dip very gently to the east. This means that the oldest strata are exposed along the Virgin River in the Zion Canyon part of the park, and the youngest are exposed in the Kolob Canyons section. The plateau is bounded on the east by the Sevier Fault Zone, and on the west by the Hurricane Fault Zone. Weathering and erosion along north-trending faults and fractures influence the formation of landscape features, such as canyons, in this region.

==Grand Staircase and basement rocks==
The Grand Staircase is an immense sequence of sedimentary rock layers that stretch south from Bryce Canyon National Park through Zion National Park and into the Grand Canyon. Within this sequence, the oldest exposed formation in the Zion and Kolob canyons area is the youngest exposed formation in the Grand Canyon—the Kaibab limestone. Bryce Canyon to the northeast continues where the Zion and Kolob areas end by presenting Cenozoic-aged rocks. In fact, the youngest formation seen in the Zion and Kolob area is the oldest exposed formation in Bryce Canyon—the Dakota Sandstone.

In the Permian period, the Zion and Kolob area was a relatively flat basin near sea level on the western margin of the supercontinent Pangaea. Sediments from surrounding mountains added weight to the basin, keeping it at relatively the same elevation. These sediments later lithified (turned to rock) to form the Toroweap Formation, now exposed in the Grand Canyon to the south but not in the Zion and Kolob area. This formation is not exposed in the park, though it does form its basement rock.

==Deposition of sediments==

===Kaibab Limestone (Upper Permian)===
In later Permian time, the Toroweap Basin was invaded by the warm, shallow edge of the vast Panthalassa ocean in what local geologists call the Kaibab Sea. At that time, Utah and Wyoming were near the equator on the western margin of the supercontinent Pangaea.
Starting 260 million years ago, the yellowish-gray limestone of the fossil-rich Kaibab Limestone was laid down as a limy ooze in a tropical climate. During this time, sponges, such as &quot;Actinocoelia meandrina&quot;, proliferated, only to be buried in lime mud and their internal silica needles (spicules) dissolved and recrystallized to form discontinuous layers of light-colored chert. In the park, this formation can be found in the Hurricane Cliffs above the Kolob Canyons Visitor Center and in an escarpment along Interstate 15 as it skirts the park. This is the same formation that rims the Grand Canyon to the south.

Farther to the west, a complex island arc assemblage formed above a subduction zone. To the east, in western Colorado, a mountain range similar to today&#x27;s Himalayas called the Uncompahgre Mountains bordered the Utah lowland. The interfingering of the Kaibab with the White Rim Sandstone, now exposed in Capitol Reef National Park area, to the east suggests that the marine facies of the Kaibab migrated eastward in response to a relative sea-level rise, or transgression (the White Rim is not exposed in the Zion area). The sea moved back and forth across Utah, but by the Middle Permian, the sea had withdrawn and the Kaibab Limestone was exposed to erosion, creating karst topography and channels reaching 30 m (100 ft) in depth.

===Moenkopi Formation (Lower Triassic)===

Volcanoes continued to erupt through the Early Triassic on the north–south trending island arc to the west, which was located along what is now the border between California and Nevada. Shallow, marine water stretched from eastern Utah to eastern Nevada over a beveled continental shelf. As the sea withdrew around 230 million years ago, fluvial, mudflat, sabkha, and shallow marine environments developed, depositing gypsum (from lagoon evaporites), mudstones, limestones, sandstones, shales, and siltstones.

It took many thousands of thin layers of these sediments to form the thick Moenkopi Formation. A prograding shoreline laid down muddy delta sediments which mixed with limy marine deposits. The fossilized plants and animals in the Moenkopi are evidence of a climate shift to a warm tropical setting that may have experienced monsoonal, wet-dry conditions.

The Red Canyon Conglomerate, the basal member of the Moenkopi, fills broad east-flowing paleochannels carved into the Kaibab Limestone. Some of these channels are up to several tens of feet deep and may reach 200 ft (61 m) deep in the St. George area. A thin, poorly developed soil, or regolith, formed over the paleotopographic high areas between the channels.

The depositional environment was a nearshore one where the seashore alternated between advance (transgression) and retreat (regression). At Zion, the limestones and fossils of the Timpoweap, Virgin Limestone, and Shnabkaib members of the Moenkopi Formation document transgressive episodes. Unlike the Timpoweap and Virgin Limestone members, the Shnabkaib contains abundant gypsum and interbedded mudstone resulting from deposition in a restricted marine environment with complex watertable fluctuations. Regressive, red bed layers separate the transgressive strata. Ripple marks, mud cracks, and thinly laminated bedding suggest that these intervening red shale and siltstone units were deposited in tidal flat and coastalplain environments.

Outcrops of this brightly colored red, brown, and pink banded formation can be seen in the Kolob Canyons section of the park and in buttes on either side of State Route 9 between Rockville, Utah, to the south and Virgin, Utah, to the southwest of the park borders. Progressively higher beds are exposed until the top of the formation is reached at the mouth of Parunweap Canyon (when traveling to the park on Route 9).

===Chinle Formation (Upper Triassic)===
Later, uplift exposed the Moenkopi Formation to erosion and Utah became part of a large interior basin drained by north and northwest-flowing
rivers in the Upper Triassic. Shallow river deposition along with volcanic ash eventually became the mineral-rich Chinle Formation. The irregular contact zone, or unconformity, between the Chinle and the underlying Moenkopi can be seen between Rockville and Grafton in southwestern Utah.
Petrified wood and fossils of animals adapted to swampy environments, such as phytosaurs, lungfish, and lacustrine bivalves, have been found in this formation as well as conifer trees, cycads, ferns, and horsetails. Relatively plentiful uranium ore, such as carnotite and other uranium-bearing minerals, has also been found. The purple, pink, blue, white, yellow, gray, and red colored Chinle also contains shale, gypsum, limestone, sandstone, and quartz. Iron, manganese oxides and copper sulfide are often found filling gaps between pebbles. Purplish slopes made of the Chinle can be seen above the town of Rockville.

The sand, gravel, and petrified wood which made up these deposits were later strongly cemented by dissolved silica (probably from volcanic ash from the west) in groundwater. Much of the bright coloration of the Chinle is due to soil formation during the Late Triassic. The lowermost member of the Chinle, the Shinarump, consists of a white, gray, and brown conglomerate made of coarse sandstone, and thin lenses of sandy mudstone, along with plentiful petrified wood. The Shinarump was laid down in braided streams that flowed through valleys eroded into the underlying Moenkopi Formation. This member of the Chinle forms prominent cliffs with thickness up to , and its name comes from a Native American word meaning &quot;wolf&#x27;s rump&quot; (a reference to the way this member erodes into gray, rounded hills).

A succession of volcanic-ash-rich mudstone and sandstone with a thickness of make up the Petrified Forest Member of the Chinle, which was deposited by lakes, highly sinuous rivers and on the surrounding floodplains. This is the same bright, multicolored part of the Chinle that is exposed in Petrified Forest National Park and the Painted Desert. Petrified wood is, of course, also common in this member.

===Moenave and Kayenta formations (Lower Jurassic)===
Early Jurassic uplift created an unconformity above the Chinle Formation that represents about ten million years of missing sedimentation between it and the next formation, the Moenave. Periodic incursions of shallow seas from the north during the Jurassic flooded parts of Wyoming, Montana, and a northeast–southwest trending trough on the Utah/Idaho border. The Moenave was deposited in a variety of river, lake, and flood-plain environments.
The oldest beds of this formation belong to the Dinosaur Canyon Member, a reddish, slope-forming rock layer with thin beds of siltstone that are interbedded with mudstone and fine sandstone. The Dinosaur Canyon, with a local thickness of , was probably laid down in slow-moving streams, ponds and large lakes. Evidence for this is in cross-bedding of the sediments and large numbers of fish fossils.

The upper member of the Moenave is the pale reddish-brown with a thickness of and cliff-forming Springdale Sandstone. It was deposited in swifter, larger, and more voluminous streams than the older Dinosaur Canyon Member. Fossils of large sturgeon-like freshwater fish have been found in the beds of the Springdale Sandstone. The next member in the Moenave Formation is the thin-bedded Whitmore Point, which is made of mudstone and shale. The lower red cliffs visible from the Zion Human History Museum (until 2000 the Zion Canyon Visitor Center) are accessible examples of this formation.
At thick, the Kayenta Formation&#x27;s sand and silt were laid down in early Jurassic time in slower-moving, intermittent streambeds in a semiarid to tropical environment. Interbedded sandstone, basal conglomerates, siltstones, mudstones, and thin cross-beds are typical channel and floodplain deposits found in the Kayenta. Paleocurrent studies show that the Kayenta rivers flowed in a general westward to southwestward direction.

Fossilized dinosaur footprints from sauropods have been found in this formation near the Left Fork of North Creek. Mountains in Nevada and California continued to rise in the Lower Jurassic as plate motions forced North America
northward. Eventually, this created a rain shadow and brought widespread desertification. Today the Kayenta is a red and mauve rocky slope-former that can be seen throughout Zion Canyon.

===Navajo Sandstone (Lower to Mid Jurassic)===

Approximately 190 to 136 million years ago in the Jurassic the Colorado Plateau area&#x27;s climate increasingly became arid until 150,000 square miles (388,000 km2) of western North America became a huge desert, not unlike the modern Sahara. For perhaps 10 million years sometime around 175 million years ago sand dunes accumulated, reaching their greatest thickness in the Zion Canyon area; about 2,200 feet (670 m) at the Temple of Sinawava (photo) in Zion Canyon.

Most of the sand, made of 98% translucent, rounded-grain quartz, was transported from coastal sand dunes to the west, in what is now central Nevada. Today the Navajo Sandstone is a geographically widespread, pale tan to red cliff and monolith former with very obvious sand dune cross-bedding patterns (photo). Typically the lower part of this remarkably homogeneous formation is reddish from iron oxide that percolated from the overlaying iron-rich Temple Cap formation while the upper part of the formation is a pale tan to nearly white color. The other component of the Navajo&#x27;s weak cement matrix is calcium carbonate, but the resulting sandstone is friable (crumbles easily) and very porous. Cross-bedding is especially evident in the eastern part of the park where Jurassic wind directions changed often. The crosshatched appearance of Checkerboard Mesa is a good example (photo).

Springs, such as Weeping Rock (photo), form in canyon walls made of the porous Navajo Sandstone when water hits and is channeled by the underlying non-porous Kayenta Formation. The principal aquifer in the region is contained in Navajo Sandstone. Navajo is the most prominent formation exposed in Zion Canyon with the highest exposures being West Temple and Checkerboard Mesa. The monoliths in the sides of Zion Canyon are among the tallest sandstone cliffs in the world.

===Temple Cap and Carmel formations (Middle Jurassic)===

Utah and western Colorado were deformed as the rate of subduction off the west coast increased in the Middle Jurassic Sevier Orogeny. At the same time, an inland sea began to encroach on the continent from the north. Broad tidal flats and streams carrying iron oxide-rich mud formed on the margins of the shallow sea to the west, creating the &quot;Sinawava member&quot; of the Temple Cap Formation. Flat-bedded sandstones, siltstones, and limestones filled depressions left in the underlying eroded strata. Streams eroded the poorly cemented Navajo Sandstone, and water caused the sand to slump.

Desert conditions returned briefly, creating the &quot;White Throne member&quot;, but encroaching seas again beveled the coastline, forming a regional unconformity. Thin beds of clay and silt mark the end of this formation. The most prominent outcrops of this formation make up the capstone of The West Temple in Zion Canyon. Rain dissolves some of the iron oxide and thus streaks Zion&#x27;s cliffs red (the red streak seen on the Altar of Sacrifice is a famous example). Temple Cap iron oxide is also the source of the red-orange color of much the lower half of the Navajo Formation.
A warm, shallow inland sea started to advance into the region (transgress) 150 million years ago, finishing the job of flattening the sand dunes. Limy ooze with some sand and fossils were laid down as thick sedimentation beds from Mid to Late Jurassic time. Some calcareous silt percolated down into the buried sand dunes (carrying red oxides with it) and eventually cemented them into the sandstone of the Navajo Formation. The limy ooze above would later lithify into the hard and compact limestone of the Carmel Formation, thick.

Many unique environments were created by the migrating Sevier thrust system, and the four members of the Carmel Formation in southwest Utah capture these changing environments. Both open marine (crinoids) and restricted marine (pelecypods, gastropods) environments are represented in the Co-op Creek member. Sandstone and gypsum in the Crystal Creek and Paria River members signal a return to desert conditions in a coastal setting.

Outcrops of the Carmel Formation are most notably exposed on Horse Ranch Mountain (photo) in the Kolob Canyons section of the park and near Mt. Carmel Junction east of the park. Other formations totaling thick may have been deposited in the region during Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous only to be uplifted and entirely removed by erosion.

===Dakota Sandstone (Lower Cretaceous)===

Mountains continued to rise in the Sevier orogenic belt to the west during the Cretaceous while the roughly north-south trending Western Interior Basin expanded. Rifting in the Gulf of Mexico helped the southern end of the basin to subside, which allowed marine water to advance northward. At the same time, the shoreline advanced inland from the Arctic region. The seas advanced and retreated many times during the Cretaceous until one of the most extensive interior seaways ever, called the Western Interior Seaway, drowned much of western North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. The western shoreline of the seaway was in the vicinity of Cedar City, Utah, while the eastern margin was part of the low-lying, stable platform ramp in Nebraska and Kansas.

The pebble to cobble conglomerate and tan fossil-rich sandstone of the resulting thick Dakota Sandstone include alluvial fan and alluvial plain sediments that grade laterally into coastal plain, marginal marine, and marine deposits. A small remnant of the Dakota is exposed on top of the -high Horse Ranch Mountain (photo). This formation is the youngest one exposed in the Zion area but the oldest exposed in Bryce Canyon to the northeast. Deposition continued but the resulting formations were later uplifted and eroded away. The exposed formations in the Bryce Canyon area likely represent these lost layers.

==Tectonic activity and erosion==

===Regional forces===
East–west-directed compression from subduction off the west coast affected the area in later Mesozoic and early Tertiary time by folding and thrust faulting strata. Evidence for the Sevier Orogeny part of this period can be seen in the Taylor Creek area in the Kolob section of the park. Chunks of Moenave strata have been compressed to the point of thrusting themselves over the same formation in the Taylor Creek Thrust Fault Zone, located on the east flank of the Kanarra anticline.

Tensional forces forming the Basin and Range physiogeographic province to the west about 20 to 25 million years ago in Tertiary time created the two faults that bound the Markagunt Plateau (which underlies the park): the Sevier Fault on the east and the Hurricane Fault on the west. The Hurricane fault zone is a major, active, steeply west-dipping normal fault that stretches at least 155 miles (250 km) from south of the Grand Canyon northward to Cedar City, Utah. Along the southern boundary of the park, tectonic displacement along this fault is about 3,600 ft (1,098 m). Several other normal faults also developed on the plateau.

Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau and tilting of the Markagunt Plateau started 13 million years ago. This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral Virgin River (Zion Canyon section of the park), and Taylor and La Verkin creeks (Kolob Canyons section of the park), causing them to flow and downcut faster into the underlying Markagunt Plateau. Downcutting continues to be especially rapid after heavy rainstorms and winter runoff when the water contains large amounts of suspended and abrasive sand grains. Uplift and downcutting are so fast that slot canyons (very narrow river-cut features with vertical walls), such as the Zion Narrows, formed.

===Volcanic activity===
Explosive andesitic volcanism dominated the area to the west of Zion during Oligocene and early Miocene time and probably inundated the region with hundreds of feet of welded tuff that has since eroded away. Three of these tuff layers are preserved on top of Brainhead Peak. About 21 million years ago the Pine Valley laccolith formed. This typical mushroom-shaped laccolith is one of the largest intrusions of this type in the world. Debris flows carried boulders of this intrusion onto the Upper Kolob Plateau indicating that the Hurricane Cliffs could not have been present at the time.
Then from at least 1.4 million to 250,000 years ago in Pleistocene time basaltic lava flowed intermittently in the area, taking advantage of uplift-created weaknesses in the Earth&#x27;s crust. Volcanic activity was concentrated along the Hurricane Fault west of the park that today parallels Interstate 15. Evidence of the oldest flows can be seen at Lava Point and rocks from the youngest are found at the lower end of Cave Valley.&gt; Some cinder cones were constructed much later in the southwest corner of the park.

Some of these lava flows blocked rivers and streams, impounding small lakes and ephemeral ponds in the process. About 100,000 years ago, basalt from the largest cinder cone in the park, Crater Hill, flowed over the area. The lava traveled into Coalpits and Scoggins Washes to the south and accumulated to a depth of over 400 ft (122 m) in the ancestral Virgin River valley near the present-day ghost town of Grafton, Utah. Water impounded behind the two blockages, forming Coalpits Lake and Lake Grafton respectively.

Lake Grafton was the largest of at least 14 lakes that have periodically formed in the park (most were from landslides; see below). Thirteen lava flows are mapped in and near Zion dating from 1.5 million to 100,000 years ago. More recent flows of less than 10,000 years in age occurred north of Zion and east of Cedar Breaks National Monument.

===Erosion and canyon formation===

Stream downcutting continued along with canyon-forming processes such as mass wasting; sediment-rich and abrasive flood stage waters would undermine cliffs until vertical slabs of rock sheared away. This process continues to be especially efficient with the vertically jointed Navajo Sandstone.

All erosion types took advantage of preexisting weaknesses in the rock such as rock type, amount of lithification, and the presence of cracks or joints in the rock. Basalt flows concentrated in valleys but subsequent erosion removed sedimentary rock that once stood at higher elevations. The resulting inverted relief consists of ridges capped by basalt which are separated by adjacent drainages.

In all about of sediment were removed from atop the youngest exposed formation in the park (the Late Cretaceous-aged Dakota Sandstone). The Virgin River carved out of sediment in about 1 million years. This is a very high rate of downcutting, about the same rate as occurred in Grand Canyon during its most rapid period of erosion. About 1 million years ago, Zion Canyon was only about half as deep as it is today in the vicinity of Zion Lodge. Assuming that erosion was fairly constant over the past 2 million years, then the upper half of Zion Canyon was carved between about 1 and 2 million years ago and only the upper half of the Great White Throne was exposed 1 million years ago and The Narrows were yet to form.

Downcutting and canyon widening continue today as the process of erosion continues to try to reduce the topography to sea level. In 1998 a flash flood temporarily increased the Virgin River&#x27;s flow rate from 200 to 4,500 ft3/s (6 to 125 m3/s). Geologists estimate that the Virgin River can cut another thousand feet (300 m) before it loses the ability to transport sediment to the Colorado River to the south. However, additional uplift will probably increase this figure.

===Landslides and earthquakes===

Landslides more than once dammed the Virgin River and created lakes where sediment accumulated. Every time the river eventually breached the slide and drained the lake, leaving a flat-bottomed valley. About 7,000 years ago, the relatively thin wall between two closely spaced joints in the Navajo Sandstone collapsed. The resulting Sand Bench landslide blocked Zion Canyon just east of The Sentinel, creating Sentinel Lake. Another notable stand was created about 4,000 years ago when Sentinel Slide impounded the North Fork Virgin River, creating a lake that backed up to Weeping Rock. The current site of Zion Lodge was under about of water for around 700 years. Evidence of valley floors created by these lakes can be seen from Zion Canyon Scenic Drive south of Zion Lodge near Sentinel Slide. Recent landslides in 1923, 1941, and 1995 have temporarily dammed the Virgin River. Prior to the initial Sand Bench landslide, the Virgin River flowed 70 ft (21 m) lower in elevation than it does today.

The area is periodically rocked by mild to moderate earthquakes, which often trigger landslides. For example, on September 2, 1992, a Richter Magnitude 5.8 earthquake caused 14 million cubic meters (18 million cubic yards) of mostly Moenave Formation to slide downslope atop the weak claystone of the Petrified Forest member of the Chinle Formation. The quake was centered on the Washington Fault, about southwest. Three houses and two water tanks were destroyed when the slope they were built on dropped and extended laterally a similar distance over a period of several hours. The landslide is visible just outside the park&#x27;s entrance in Springdale, Utah.

<text>The Palmach (Hebrew: , acronym for , &quot;Plugot Maḥatz&quot;, &quot;Strike Companies&quot;) was the elite combined strike forces and sayeret unit of the Haganah, the underground army of the Yishuv (Jewish community) during the period of the British Mandate for Palestine. The Palmach was established in May 1941. By the outbreak of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, it consisted of over 2,000 men and women in three fighting brigades and auxiliary aerial, naval and intelligence units. With the creation of Israel&#x27;s army, the three Palmach Brigades were disbanded. This and political reasons compelled many of the senior Palmach officers to resign in 1950.

The Palmach contributed significantly to Israeli culture and ethos, well beyond its military contribution. Its members formed the backbone of the Israel Defense Forces high command for many years, and were prominent in Israeli politics, literature and culture.

== Background ==

The Palmach was established by the Haganah High Command in May 1941. Its aim was to defend the Palestinian Jewish community against two potential threats. Firstly the occupation of Palestine by the Axis in the event of their victory over the British in North Africa. Secondly, if the British army were to retreat from Palestine, Jewish settlements might come under attack from the Arab population. Yitzhak Sadeh was named as Palmach commander. Initially the group consisted of around one hundred men. In the early summer of 1941 the British military authorities agreed to joint operations against Vichy French forces in Lebanon and Syria. The first action was a sabotage mission (Operation Boatswain) against oil installations at Tripoli, Lebanon. Twenty-three Palmach members and a British liaison officer set out by sea but were never heard of again. On 8 June mixed squads of Palmach and Australians began operating in Lebanon and Syria. The success of these operations led the British GHQ to fund a sabotage training camp for three hundred men at Mishmar HaEmek. Since the Palmach consisted of unpaid volunteers, the funding was used to cover the needs of twice that number of men. When the British ordered the dismantling of Palmach after the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein in 1942, the organization went underground.

==Underground==

Since British funding had stopped, Yitzhak Tabenkin, head of the kibbutz union HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, suggested the Palmach could be self-funding by having its members work in the kibbutzim. Each kibbutz would host a Palmach platoon and supply them with food, homes and resources. In return the platoon would safeguard the kibbutz and carry out work such as agricultural work. The proposal was accepted in August 1942, when it was also decided that each month Palmach members would have eight training days, 14 work days and seven days off. The program of combined military training, agricultural work and Zionist education was called &quot;Hach&#x27;shara Meguyeset&quot; הכשרה מגויסת (meaning &quot;Drafted/Recruited Training&quot;). Later, Zionist youth movements offered members aged 18–20 an opportunity to join core groups (gar&#x27;in) for agricultural settlement that became the basis for the Nahal.

Basic training included physical fitness, small arms, mêlée and KAPAP, basic marine training, topography, first aid and squad operations. Most of the Palmach members received advanced training in one or more of the following areas: sabotage and explosives, reconnaissance, sniping, communications and radio, light and medium machine guns, and operating 2-inch and 3-inch mortars. Platoon training included long marches, combined live-fire drills with artillery support and machine guns and mortars.

The Palmach put great emphasis on training independent and broadminded field commanders who would take the initiative and set an example for their troops. It trained squad commanders and company commanders. The major commanders training course was in the Palmach and many Haganah commanders were sent to be trained in the Palmach. The Palmach commanders&#x27; course was the source for many field commanders, who were the backbone of Haganah and, later, the Israel Defense Forces.

==Postwar operations==
For seven months after the assassination of Lord Moyne by Lehi in 1944, members of the Palmach under the command of Shimon Avidan were involved in the Saison activities, in which they cooperated with the British in an attempt to crush the Irgun and Lehi. However, with David Ben-Gurion&#x27;s decision, 1 October 1945, to launch an armed struggle against the British, the Palmach entered an alliance with the dissident groups, called The Hebrew Resistance Movement. On 10 October 1945 a force led by Yitzhak Rabin raided the prison at Atlit freeing 208 Jewish prisoners. The first joint operation took place on 31 October 1945 when the Palmach sank three British patrol boats, 2 in Haifa and one in Jaffa, and were involved in 153 bomb attacks on bridges and culverts of the railway system.

On the night of 22 February 1946, the Palmach attacked the police Tegart fort at Shefa-&#x27;Amr with a 200-pound bomb; in the firefight that followed, the Palmach suffered casualties. In June 1946 the Palmach blew up ten of the eleven bridges connecting Palestine to its neighbouring countries. Fourteen Palmach members were killed during the attack on Achziv Bridge.

The alliance was never completely under Haganah control and the Irgun launched a series of ever more ruthless attacks culminating in the King David Hotel bombing. This attack was the Irgun&#x27;s response to a British crackdown, &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, launched on 29 June 1946. A combination of the crackdown and the Jewish civilian leadership&#x27;s outrage at the King David attack led Ben-Gurion to call off further Palmach operations.

===Retaliation raids===

After a gap of over ten months the Palmach resumed operations. The one weapon of which there was no shortage was locally produced explosives. On 20 May 1947 they blew up a coffee house in Fajja, specifically in retaliation for the murder of two Jews in nearby Petah Tikva. Following the escalation of violence after the UN Partition Resolution the scale of the retaliation operations increased.

On 18 December 1947, in an operation approved by Palmach commander Yigal Allon, several houses were blown up in al-Khisas, near the Lebanese border; a dozen civilians were killed. On 31 December 1947 170 men from the Palmach launched an attack on Balad al-Sheikh, Haifa, in retaliation for the killing of 47 Jews at the Haifa oil refinery. Several dozen houses were destroyed and 60-70 villagers were killed.

Around Jaffa, Palmach units destroyed houses in Yazur and Salama. An order dated 3 January 1948 said &quot;The aim is ... to attack northern part of the village of Salama ... to cause deaths, to blow up houses and to burn everything possible.&quot; In the Upper Galilee, the Palmach&#x27;s third Battalion commanded by Moshe Kelman, attacked Sa&#x27;sa&#x27;, 15 February, and blew up ten houses, killing 11 villagers. Further north, they raided al-Husayniyya, 16 March 1948, in retaliation for a land mine, they blew up five houses and killed &quot;30 Arab adults&quot;. In the Northern Negev, 4 April 1948, a Palmach unit in two armoured cars destroyed &quot;nine bedouin lay-bys and one mud hut&quot; after a mine attack on a Jewish Patrol.

During this period, in the event known as the Convoy of 35, the Palmach lost 18 men (along with 17 other Haganah fighters) on their way to reinforce the garrison at Kfar Etzion after they were attacked by hundreds of Arab locals and militias. The bodies of the Palmach and Haganah fighters were mutilated to the point that some of them could not be recognized.

===A change in objectives===
On 20 February 1948 the Palmach launched an operation in Caesarea, North of Tel Aviv, in which they demolished 30 houses, six were left standing due to lack of explosives. The objective was to prevent them being occupied by British troops as a base against illegal immigrants. Yitzhak Rabin opposed the attack. Although occupied by Arabs the buildings were Jewish owned.

With the activation of Plan D and its sub-operations Palmach units were used to demolish villages with the objective of preventing them being used by Palestinian irregulars or the Arab Liberation Army (ALA) as bases.

===Operation Nachshon===

Following the attempt to clear the road to Jerusalem, Palmach units &quot;more or less systematically leveled the villages of al-Qastal, Qalinya, Khuda and largely or partly destroyed Beit Surik, Biddu, Shu&#x27;fat, Beit Iksa, Beit Mahsir and Sheikh Jarrah (Jerusalem)&quot;.

On 9 April a Palmach unit with mortars took part in the Irgun attack on Deir Yassin.

===Mishmar Ha&#x27;amek===

Following the failed ALA attack on the Haganah base at Mishmar Ha&#x27;amek, and the Haganah&#x27;s refusal of an offer of a truce, Haganah and Palmach troops counterattacked. Between 8 and 14 April, ten villages came under Palmach&#x27;s control. Within two weeks they were leveled.

===Operation Yiftach and the conquest of Safad===

On 2 May, the Palmach 3rd Battalion, commanded by Moshe Kelman, attacked Ein al-Zeitun with a Davidka, two 3-inch mortars and eight 2-inch mortars. During the following two days Palmach sappers blew up and burned all the houses. In the aftermath of the capture of this village Battalion Commander Kelman ordered the execution of seventy prisoners.

On 6 May the Palmach launched an attack on Safad. It failed to capture the citadel and the Palmach had to withdraw. The defenders offered a cease-fire, which Allon refused. A second attack was launched on 9 May. This was preceded by a &quot;massive concentrated barrage&quot; using mortars and Davidkas. The empty Arab quarter of Safad was occupied on 11 May. Between 12,000 and 15,000 refugees had been created.

The Palmach suffered 69 killed during Operation Yiftah.

In May 1948 the Palmach had 2,200 permanently mobilised members. A different source puts the size of the Palmach as 3,000 at the end of November 1947, and, following the mobilization of 3,000 reserves, five battalions were formed by May 1948, consisting of 5,000 fighters of whom 1,200 were women.

Palmach units took a major part in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. At the beginning of the war, Palmach units were responsible for holding Jewish settlements (such as Gush Etzion, Kfar Darom and Revivim) against Arab militias. Although inferior in numbers and arms, Palmach soldiers held out long enough to allow the Haganah to mobilise the Jewish population and prepare for war.

===The creation of the Israeli Army===
The Palmach&#x27;s last operation as an independent unit was against the Irgun, in the Altalena Affair. On 22 June 1948 the Irgun moored the Altalena, loaded with weapons, off Tel Aviv. Ben-Gurion ordered the Palmach to prevent the arms being landed. In an operation commanded by Yigal Allon, with Yitzhak Rabin as his deputy, a cannon was used to sink the ship. One member of the Palmach and fourteen members of the Irgun were killed.

After the establishment of the Israeli army, the Palmach was reorganised into three IDF brigades—the Negev Brigade, the Yiftach Brigade, and the Harel Brigade. The Negev and Yiftah Brigades fought in the Negev against the Egyptian army and managed to stop and later repulse it into the Gaza Strip and Sinai. The Yiftah Brigade was later transferred to the north. The Harel Brigade was centered on Jerusalem. The merging of the Palmach into the Israeli army involved a series of power struggles with Ben-Gurion, known as The Generals&#x27; Revolt. In 1949 many senior members of the Palmach resigned from the army.

In total, the Palmach lost 1,187 fighters during the war of independence and in the years prior to Israel&#x27;s creation.

===Casualties===

The Palmach memorial site records 37 deaths of Palmach members between May 1941 and May 1945. Thirty-one are described as killed in action, six were killed while serving in the British Army and six were killed in the &quot;Struggle against the British Government&quot;.

A further 39 members of the Palmach died between the May 1945 and November 1947. Twenty-one are recorded as killed in action and one killed in battle, fourteen being killed during the attempt to blow up the Achziv Bridge during the Night of the Bridges. Twenty-eight died in the struggle against the British.

Between the beginning of December 1947 and the end of May 1948, when the Israeli army was created, 574 deaths are listed, of whom 524 were killed in action or in battle; 77 while on convoy duty or securing roads; 59 during Operation Yevusi, including 34 at Nabi Samuel; 20 during Operation Nachshon, all at al-Qastal; 68 during Operation Yiftach; 12 at Mishmar HaEmek. By district 171 members of the Palmach were killed in Jerusalem and the surrounding area, 104 in and around Gush Etzion, 103 in the Galilee and 81 in the Negev.

From June 1948 to December 1949, during which time the Palmach was absorbed into the army, 527 members died, 452 killed in action or in battle; 101 were killed during Operation Danny, including 45 at Khirbet Kurikur; 53 during Operation Yoav; 44 in Operation Horev and 22 during Operation Death to the Invader. By district 234 died in the Negev and Southern Plain; 62 in Jerusalem and surrounds; 44 around Latrun; 42 in the Gaza Strip and 41 in the Central Plain and Coastal Strip.

By Brigade, 313 members of the Harel Brigade were killed, 312 from the Negev and 274 from the Yiftach. One of the dead is listed as also being a member of the Lechi.

The Palmach memorial site records the death of 34 female members, seventeen killed in action or in battle.

Around 520 of the fatalities had been born in Palestine; of whom 117 were from Tel Aviv, 97 from Jerusalem and 56 from Haifa. Over 550 had been born in Europe and Russia; with 181 from Poland, 99 from Germany and 95 from Romania. Another 131 of the dead originated from Arab and Muslim countries; 32 from Turkey, 23 from Syria and 21 from the Yemen. Of the remainder 13 had been born in the USA.

Of the dead, 633 were aged between 18 and 22 years, 302 were between 22 and 25, 138 were 26 and over, and 91 were under 18 years of age.

== Military organization ==
The Palmach was organised into regular companies (six in 1943), and five or six special units.

Palmach special units included:

* Ha-Machlaka Ha-Germanit: the &quot;German Platoon&quot; (aka the Middle East Commando) performed covert operations and sabotage operations against Nazi infrastructure in the Middle East and the Balkans.
* Ha-Machlaka Ha-Aravit: the &quot;Arab Platoon&quot; performed covert operations and espionage missions against Arab militias, which frequently attacked Jewish settlements. It was the base for the Israeli Defense Forces&#x27;s and the Israeli Border Police&#x27;s Mista&#x27;arvim units.
* Palyam (Sea Companies): the naval force of the Palmach was formed in 1943, attached to the Palmach&#x27;s Staff Battalion (the 4th Battalion). They were in charge of underwater demolition and maritime activity units. The majority of their activities were related to the escorting of ships of Aliyah Bet, immigration ships (66 of them in all) bringing Jewish refugees from Europe by boat, despite the British White Paper of 1939, which introduced restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine.
* Palavir (The Air Companies): made up of Jewish pilots, the Palmach air force was incorporated into the Sherut Avir (predecessor of the Israeli Air Force) upon the Sherut&#x27;s foundation in late 1947. Eighteen Taylorcraft Auster Mk V aircraft and two Mk IIIs were purchased by Aviron from RAF scrapheap at Tel Nof 14 January 1947, with at least 13 aircraft restored to flying condition. First delivered late Feb 1948, these were used by the Palavir&#x27;s, Tel Aviv, Galilee and Negev Squadrons for supply, reconnaissance and light attack roles.
* Sabotage Units: explosives experts who became the basis for the Israeli Engineering Corps in the IDF.

The Palmach put an emphasis on training field commanders (מפקדי שטח) and formed the basis for the Israeli army.

During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the Palmach was expanded to form three infantry brigades commanded by Yigal Allon:

* Yiftach, with three battalions operating in Eastern Galilee (1st and 3rd and later 2nd)
* Harel, with three battalions operating (4th, 5th and 10th) in the Jerusalem area commanded by Yitzhak Rabin (then age 26)
* Negev, with four battalions (2nd, 7th, 8th and 9th), one of which was the jeep mounted &quot;Negev Beasts&quot;

The Command Battalion controlled naval, air and commando companies.

The battle cry of the Palmach commander was &quot;!אחרי&quot; (&quot;Aharai&quot;), which literally means &quot;after me!&quot; or &quot;follow me!&quot;. It refers to the commander leading his troops instead of sending them out and staying behind.

== In politics and culture ==
The Palmach was a broad spectrum left-wing nationalist organisation, associated with socialist parties. Its members trained and lived in kibbutzim. The political tendencies of its leaders such as Yigal Allon and Yitzhak Sadeh was towards Mapam, a left-wing party in opposition to David Ben-Gurion and the Mapai ruling party. In 1944 a major split had occurred in Palestine&#x27;s Jewish community&#x27;s dominant party, Mapai, led by David Ben-Gurion. The breakaway group Ahdut HaAvoda, which evolved into Mapam, were inspired by Stalin&#x27;s regime in the Soviet Union, and had a strong following in the kibbutz movement. Since most of the Palmach&#x27;s members came from the kibbutzim, the Mapam dominated the Palmach, with a majority of its officers being members. After 1948 Ben-Gurion, Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of the new state, had a series of confrontations with leaders of the Haganah and the Palmach. In a process that Ben-Gurion described as de-politicizing the army, the three Palmach brigades were disbanded and in 1950 most of the Mapam officers resigned. Those Palmach members who had been in Mapam and remained in the army had to endure several years on the margins. The effect of the de-politicizing was that all senior army posts were held by Mapai members or Ben-Gurion loyalists. After demobilization many Palmach members founded new kibbutzim. In 1949 they set up Bar&#x27;am, Beit Guvrin, Nir Yitzhak (named in honour of Yitzhak Sadeh), Palmachim, Re&#x27;im, Rosh HaNikra, Re&#x27;im and Yir&#x27;on. Palmach members were not, however, a unified, homogeneous collective with a single ideology. In the early years of the state of Israel they could be found in all political parties.

Yigal Allon, considered by many to be the representative of the Palmach generation, never reached a position of national leadership although he was Prime Minister for a few days between Eshkol&#x27;s death and Meir&#x27;s appointment in 1969. He died in 1980.

Besides military contributions, the Palmach had great influence over the Israeli &quot;Tzabar&quot; culture. Palmach activities included &quot;Kumzitz&quot; (sitting around a fire at night, eating, talking and having fun), public singing and cross-country walking trips. These often took on mythical proportions and have become favorite activities for Israelis.

The Palmach also contributed many anecdotes, jokes, &quot;chizbat&quot; (short funny tales, often based on exaggerations), songs and even books and stories.

Notable Palmach cultural figures include:
* Yehuda Amichai – poet
* Dahn Ben-Amotz – writer, journalist
* Gad Avigad – scientist
* Netiva Ben-Yehuda – journalist, writer, radio host
* Haim Hefer – poet, writer
* Haim Gouri – poet, writer
* Shaike Ophir – actor
* Moshe Shamir – writer, playwright
* Hannah Szenes (Senesh) – poet
* Vidal Sassoon – British hairdresser

<doc id="630237" wikidata="Q11832461" url="?curid=630237" title="Vertical loop">
<text>The generic roller coaster vertical loop, also known as a Loop-the-loop, or a Loop-de-loop, where a section of track causes the riders to complete a 360 degree turn, is the most basic of roller coaster inversions. At the top of the loop, riders are completely inverted.

== History ==
The vertical loop is not a recent roller coaster innovation. Its origins can be traced back to the 1850s when &quot;centrifugal railways&quot; were built in France and Great Britain. The rides relied on centripetal forces to hold the car in the loop. One early looping coaster was shut down after an accident.
Later attempts to build a looping roller coaster were carried out during the late 19th century with the &quot;Flip Flap Railway&quot; at Sea Lion Park, designed by Roller coaster engineer Lina Beecher. The ride was designed with a completely circular loop (rather than the teardrop shape used by many modern looping roller coasters), and caused neck injuries due to the intense G-forces pulled with the tight radius of the loop.

The next attempt at building a looping roller coaster was in 1901 when Edwin Prescott built the &quot;Loop the Loop&quot; at Coney Island. This ride used the modern teardrop-shaped loop and a steel structure, however more people wanted to watch the attraction, rather than ride. In 1904, Beecher further redesigned the vertical loop to have an even more elliptical design with Olentangy Park&#x27;s Loop-the-Loop. Vertical loops weren&#x27;t attempted again until the design of Great American Revolution at Six Flags Magic Mountain, which opened in 1976. Its success depended largely on its clothoid-based (rather than circular) loop. The loop became a phenomenon, and many parks hastened to build roller coasters featuring them.

In 2000, a modern looping wooden roller coaster was built, the Son of Beast at Kings Island. Although the ride itself was made of wood, the loop was supported with steel structure. Due to maintenance issues however, the loop was removed at the end of the 2006 season. The loop was not the cause of the ride&#x27;s issues, but was removed as a precautionary measure. Due to an unrelated issue in 2009, Son of Beast was closed until 2012, when Kings Island announced that it would be removed.

On June 22, 2013, Six Flags Magic Mountain introduced Full Throttle, a steel launch coaster with a loop, the tallest in the world at the time of its opening. , the largest vertical loop is located on Flash, a roller coaster produced by Mack Rides at Lewa Adventure in Shaanxi, China. The record is shared by Hyper Coaster in Turkey&#x27;s Land of Legends theme park, built in 2018, which is identical to Flash at Lewa Adventure.

=== Loops on non-roller coasters ===
In 2002, the Swiss company Klarer Freizeitanlagen AG began working on a safe design for a looping water slide. Since then, multiple installations of the slide, named the AquaLoop and constructed by companies including Polin, Klarer, Aquarena and WhiteWater West, have appeared in many parks. This ride does not feature a vertical loop, instead using an inclined loop (a vertical loop tilted at an angle), which puts less force on the rider. AquaLoop slides feature a safety hatch, which can be opened by a rider in case they do not reach the highest point of the looping.

== Physics/mechanics ==
Most roller coaster loops are not circular in shape. A commonly used shape is the clothoid loop, which resembles an inverted tear drop and allows for less intense G-forces throughout the element for the rider. The use of this shape was pioneered in 1976 on The New Revolution at Six Flags Magic Mountain, by Werner Stengel of leading coaster engineering firm Ing.-Büro Stengel GmbH.

On the way up, from the bottom to the top of the loop, gravity is in opposition to the direction of the cars and will slow the train. The train is slowest at the top of the loop. Once beyond the top, gravity helps to pull the cars down around the bend. If the loop&#x27;s curvature is constant, the rider is subjected to the greatest force at the bottom. If the curvature of the track changes suddenly, as from level to a circular loop, the greatest force is imposed almost instantly (see jerk). Gradual changes in curvature, as in the clothoid, reduce the force maximum (permitting more speed) and allow the rider time to cope safely with the changing force.

This &quot;gentling&quot; runs somewhat contrary to the coaster&#x27;s &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot;. Schwarzkopf-designed roller coasters often feature near-circular loops (in case of Thriller even without any reduction of curvature between two almost perfectly circular loops) resulting in intense rides—a trademark for the designer.

It is rare for a roller coaster to stall in a vertical loop, although this has happened before. The Psyké Underground coaster (then known as Sirocco) at Walibi Belgium once stranded riders upside-down for several hours. The design of the trains and the rider restraint system (in this case, a simple lap bar) prevented any injuries from occurring, and the riders were removed with the use of a cherry picker. A similar incident occurred on Demon at Six Flags Great America.

<text>The Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) was an early men&#x27;s professional ice hockey league. It was founded in November, 1909, as the result of a dispute within the Eastern Canada Hockey Association. The CHA survived only a few weeks of play in January 1910 before two teams jumped to the new National Hockey Association (NHA), itself a seven-week-old league, causing dissolution of the CHA.

The CHA held the Stanley Cup for its entire eight week existence, as the reigning champion Ottawa Hockey Club was a founding member.

==History==

At the regular annual meeting of the Eastern Canada Hockey Association, held at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal on November 25, 1909, three teams from the ECHA (Ottawa, Quebec, and the Montreal Shamrocks) resigned and formed the new Canadian Hockey Association. The new league then took applications from other teams including their former partner the Montreal Wanderers of the ECHA. The three teams had decided to form the new league after the Wanderers were sold to new owners that wanted to move the club to the smaller Jubilee Arena from their former home, the Montreal Arena. The other clubs, most specifically Ottawa, then the Stanley Cup champions, wanted to only play at the Montreal Arena. The CHA then opened their association to applications from other hockey clubs, rejecting applications from Wanderers which did not commit to the Arena, while accepting two other teams: the All-Montreal, organized by former Wanderers captain Art Ross, and the francophone Montreal Le National.

Play started on December 30. After a few games it was clear that fan interest was not there as only 800 fans were recorded for the game between the Nationals and the Shamrocks. After the January 8 game between All-Montreal and Ottawa, which was attended by only 1500 fans, Art Ross made plans to suspend the All-Montreal team and, along with Paddy Moran, join the Haileybury team of the NHA. League secretary Emmett Quinn notified the Ottawa team that the situation was hopeless. The Shamrocks announced that they would abandon the league. The CHA owners decided to proceed with an amalgamation with the NHA, entitling the league the &quot;Canadian-National Hockey League&quot;.

A meeting with the NHA on January 15, 1910, was planned to consider amalgamation with the CHA, but amalgamation was not discussed. Instead the NHA admitted Ottawa, Quebec, and the Shamrocks. The Le National were offered the franchise of Les Canadiens, but declined, partly due to the Canadiens&#x27; lease with the Jubilee Arena. No invitation was offered to All-Montreal and Quebec. The CHA ceased operations.

During its brief season, the Ottawa Hockey Club won a Stanley Cup challenge against Galt HC, champions of the Ontario Professional Hockey League (OPHL). For this, and a challenge during the NHA season, the Senators are considered co-champions of the Stanley Cup in 1910.

<doc id="630244" wikidata="Q1503598" url="?curid=630244" title="Life in Hell">
<text>Life in Hell is a comic strip by Matt Groening that was published weekly from 1977 to 2012. Its main characters include anthropomorphic rabbits and a gay couple. The comic covers a wide range of subjects, such as love, sex, work, and death, and explores themes of angst, social alienation, self-loathing, and fear of inevitable doom.

&quot;Life in Hell&quot; caught the attention of producer James L. Brooks, who resultantly hired Groening to create animated shorts for &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;. Groening was unwilling to use his &quot;Life in Hell&quot; characters for the gig, instead creating the cast of characters that would go on to feature in the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

==History==

&quot;Life in Hell&quot; started in 1977 as a self-published comic book Groening used to describe life in Los Angeles to his friends. It was inspired by his move to the city that year; in an interview with &quot;Playboy&quot;, Groening commented on his arrival: &quot;I got [to Los Angeles] on a Friday night in August; it was about a hundred and two degrees; my car broke down in the fast lane of the Hollywood Freeway while I was listening to a drunken DJ who was giving his last program on a local rock station and bitterly denouncing the station&#x27;s management. And then I had a series of lousy jobs.&quot; In the comic book, Groening attacked what many young adults found repellent: school, work, and love. He described it as &quot;every ex-campus protester&#x27;s, every Boomer idealist&#x27;s, conception of what adult existence in the &#x27;80s had turned out to be.&quot;

Groening photocopied and distributed the magazines to friends, and also sold them for two dollars a copy at the punk corner of the record store in which he worked, Licorice Pizza on Sunset Boulevard. These magazines contained comic strips, comedy sketches, letters, and photo collages. The magazine covers were humorous as well: the first issue saw Binky, a rabbit-humanoid character, standing in a cloud of smog and declaring, &quot;What you see is what you breathe.&quot; Groening also worked other imagery into the covers, such as drawings from Jules Verne&#x27;s books and a photo of his family&#x27;s living room.

An editor from &quot;Wet&quot; magazine bought one of the magazines and liked it, and offered Groening a spot in the magazine; soon after, in 1978, &quot;Life in Hell&quot; debuted as a comic strip in the avant-garde &quot;Wet&quot;, to which Groening made his first professional cartoon sale. The first strip, entitled &quot;Forbidden Words&quot;, appeared in the September/October issue. Popular in the underground, &quot;Life in Hell&quot; was picked up by the &quot;Los Angeles Reader&quot; (an alternative weekly newspaper where Groening also worked as a typesetter, editor, paste-up artist and music critic) in 1980, where it began appearing weekly. Then-publisher of the &quot;Reader&quot; Jane Levine said Groening arrived at editor-in-chief James Vowell&#x27;s office one day, showing him his &quot;silly cartoons with the rabbit with one ear.&quot; After Groening left, Vowell came out of his office saying, &quot;This guy is gonna be famous someday.&quot;

The character designs of Akbar and Jeff were, in fact, failed attempts by Groening to draw Charlie Brown. In a 1999 interview, Groening said that he added Akbar and Jeff to the comic to appease a girlfriend. Early on in the comic, Groening used Binky and his wife to mirror the arguments Groening himself had with this girlfriend. However, she grew irritated with Groening because she felt he was portraying her unfairly. The addition of the twin-like Akbar and Jeff was meant to act as a mask of anonymity to hide who was who in such arguments. According to Groening, however, she still told him, &quot;You think you&#x27;re Akbar, but you’re really Jeff.&quot;

In a 1991 interview about &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Groening said that &quot;Life in Hell&quot; was done entirely by himself, describing the comic as &quot;Matt Groening pure and simple,&quot; and explained that the strips were often weird or entirely different every week because of however he was feeling at the time of a strip&#x27;s creation.

In November 1984, Groening&#x27;s then-girlfriend (and co-worker at the &quot;Reader&quot;), Deborah Caplan, decided to publish a compilation of Groening&#x27;s cartoons as a book entitled &quot;Love is Hell&quot;. The book was an underground success, selling 22,000 copies in its first two printings. Caplan had already left her career in advertising sales at the &quot;Reader&quot; to manage the Life in Hell Co./Acme Features Syndicate full time, which managed syndication and merchandising for Groening&#x27;s &quot;Life in Hell&quot; cartoons. The gift line included t-shirts, mugs, calendars, and greeting cards. With Caplan&#x27;s management and promotional talents his cartoon went from being published in 11 free weeklies to over 250 papers nationwide. In 1986, after Groening and Caplan had married, they published &quot;Work is Hell&quot; plus two calendars, one with cartoonist Lynda Barry. Matt&#x27;s books soon drew the attention of Pantheon/Randomhouse, which obtained the rights to distribute the books. In 1989, Life in Hell Cartoon Co/Acme closed its doors.

&quot;Life in Hell&quot; reached the attention of Hollywood producer James L. Brooks, who received one strip—&quot;The Los Angeles Way of Death&quot; from 1982—as a gift from fellow producer Polly Platt. In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of developing a series of short animated skits, called &quot;bumpers&quot;, for &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;. Groening opted to not use the &quot;Life in Hell&quot; characters for the shorts, concerned that if the cartoons were not successful it would adversely affect the strip. Instead, Groening created an entirely new batch of characters: the Simpsons.

As television began to place more demands on his time, however, Groening came to almost exclusively feature single-panel strips or 16-panel grids in which Akbar and Jeff exchange terse jabs. This later period also saw the increase of autobiographical strips, perhaps because Groening was influenced by this burgeoning trend in alternative comics.

Television had also made the strip &quot;safe enough for a number of newspapers to print&quot;, according to Groening, who said he had not &quot;toned the strip down at all, other than no longer using profanity&quot; as a concession to daily papers that carried the strip.

Groening registered the eponymous domain mattgroening.com on December 7, 1998, ostensibly to publish &quot;Life in Hell&quot; online; although Groening remarked in 2003 that he planned to eventually add content to the site, nothing substantial has ever been posted to it. An index page consisting of an image of Binky captioned &quot;This site is under construction&quot; was in place from 2001 through 2011; since then, the site has simply consisted of generic parked domain landing pages.

Groening decided in 2007, in the wake of the 2006 United States elections, to write &quot;Life Is Swell&quot; above the comic instead of &quot;Life in Hell&quot;. Though Groening had previously stated that he would never give up the comic strip, in 2009 he indicated that due to troubling times for print newspapers and constant involvement with &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Futurama&quot;, he would likely one day drop the strip. Three years later, Groening announced the strip&#x27;s conclusion and the final new strip ran on June 16, 2012. The final strip shows Akbar or Jeff dancing naked, while the other tells him to stop. At the end of the strip he gives up and dances along with him, saying &quot;Well, I tried.&quot;

==Format==

The strip was published in a perfect square, unlike most Sunday strips which are published in rectangles. Various formats were used for different strip topics. When Akbar and Jeff were discussing love Groening would use four rows of boxes, each row with four in it. Other strips had one large panel, This is based on the way Lynda Barry made comics when they were in college, and the way it was published originally in the &quot;Reader&quot;. Atop each strip is the handwritten title &quot;Life in Hell&quot; and &quot;Copyright Matt Groening&quot; and the year it was made. Sometimes the title would be stylized in different fonts, with &quot;This is your&quot; above &quot;Life in Hell,&quot; or with alternate spelling&#x27;s of Groening&#x27;s name. In the strip &quot;Why men growl&quot; he wrote his name as Matt &quot;Grrrrroening.&quot; In &quot;Are you Easily Provoked?&quot; he misspelled his name three times until getting it right and writing &quot;godamnit&quot; underneath. If the strip is cowritten, Groening writes the contributor&#x27;s name(s) underneath his. Groening sometimes put where he was when he was making the strip, such as Chicago or Portland, underneath his name.

==Characters==
*Binky is a stressed and thus &quot;normal&quot; rabbit and star of the cartoon. He usually embodies dread and alienation. Binky is usually stuck in a dead end job, has a bad apartment and regularly sees a therapist. Binky is usually full of wise old sayings.
*Sheba is Binky&#x27;s estranged girlfriend. Her character design is &quot;basically Binky in drag&quot;. Binky and Sheba met at a coffee shop in a 1981 storyline, and are often used as a generic couple whenever Groening needs one.
*Bongo is Binky&#x27;s illegitimate son, the product of a drunken night of &quot;jungle passion.&quot; He was introduced in a 1983 storyline in which his mother, Hulga, left him with Binky so she could seek her fortune in New York. Bongo&#x27;s defining physical attribute is his one ear, which Groening admits is solely so that the casual viewer can tell him apart from Binky. Bongo made an appearance in the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Xmas Story&quot;, where he is seen being sold in a pet shop. He also appeared in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror XII&quot; as one of the rabbits that Homer catches in the trap. He appears in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; again in another episode as a plush toy in Lisa&#x27;s room, though he is called Madam Bunny. He is shown as a plush toy in &quot;The Fool Monty&quot; where Mr. Burns is eating it in Bart&#x27;s closet. He has a cameo in &quot;Simpsorama&quot; as one of the rabbit-like creatures rampaging New New York, where he writes on a wall &quot;Crossovers are hell&quot;.
*Akbar &amp; Jeff are described in various strips and interviews as &quot;either brothers or lovers — or both. Whatever offends you most, that’s what they are&quot;. In one interview, Groening says they are gay. They have large noses and wear fezzes and Charlie Brown-like striped shirts. They have run numerous businesses over the years, including Akbar &amp; Jeff&#x27;s Tofu Hut, Akbar &amp; Jeff&#x27;s Earthquake T-shirt Hut, and Akbar &amp; Jeff&#x27;s Bootleg &quot;Akbar &amp; Jeff&quot; T-shirt Hut. Like Binky and Sheba, Akbar and Jeff are often used as a generic couple when needed. According to Groening, &quot;the reason why I draw a strip with Akbar and Jeff instead of Binky and Sheba is that I figure that no one can accuse me of trying to score points against men or women if the characters are identical.&quot; They have been given cameo appearances in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, such as during &quot;Homer&#x27;s Triple Bypass&quot;, where Homer uses finger puppets resembling the characters to describe his surgery to Bart and Lisa.
*Matt Groening appears in the strip as a bearded, bespectacled rabbit. He is also sometimes represented as Binky.
*Will and Abe are Matt Groening&#x27;s two sons, represented in rabbit form. They usually talk about vampires, zombies, and other child-fantasy topics.
*Snarla, a cat, is Bongo&#x27;s classmate and love interest. She bears a resemblance to Lisa Simpson.
*Bart Simpson, has never spoken—except when he uttered his former catch phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t have a cow, man!&quot; in a &quot;forbidden words&quot; strip—but is seen in the background of a number of strips.
*Mr. Simpson is Binky&#x27;s anthropomorphic dog boss at his job. His name predates &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.
*Gooey, Screwy, and Ratatouille are Akbar and/or Jeff&#x27;s triplet nephews. The names are an obvious spoof of the Disney characters Huey, Dewey and Louie (Donald Duck&#x27;s nephews).

==Recurring jokes and situations==
*Fake magazines such as &quot;Lonely Tyrant: The magazine for abusive bosses whose employees hate their guts&quot;. Stories inside include, &quot;The fine art of the meaningless memo&quot;.
*The X types of Y: The 9 types of college teachers, the 81 types of high school students, the 16 types of brothers, the 9 types of relationships.
*How-To Guides: Examples include &quot;So You Want to Be an Unrecognized Genius&quot;, &quot;How to Be a Clever Film Critic&quot;, and &quot;How to Get into the College of Your Choice&quot;.
*Miniseries – A series of strips focusing on a particular theme in a mock textbook manner, such as &quot;School is Hell&quot; and &quot;Love is Hell&quot;, both of which have been collected in their entirety in book form.
*Akbar &amp; Jeff discussing their relationship – Arguably the most common set-up. A 1992 strip, &quot;The Dart Game of Love&quot;, was prefaced with &quot;I hope this cartoon pleases you gripers who whined about all those Akbar &amp; Jeff strips where they stared at each other.&quot;
*Binky attempting to meditate
*Advertisements for disreputable businesses run by Akbar &amp; Jeff such as &quot;Akbar &amp; Jeff&#x27;s Lucky Psychic Hut&quot;.
*Bongo locked in a detention room or orphanage - Usually, with 1 or 2 pairs of eyes watching him.
*Bongo unsatisfied with the huge assortment of presents he has received on Christmas morning
*Shadow rabbit – Binky&#x27;s looming shadow towers over Bongo, who has clearly committed a crime despite his assurances to the contrary. Several of Bongo&#x27;s excuses parodied those of politicians, such as &quot;Mistakes were made&quot;. Occasionally there would also be a shadow Akbar &amp; Jeff looming over Bongo and their nephews, or Binky looming over Bongo, Jeff, and Akbar, whom are pointing fingers at each other. One comic showed Bongo&#x27;s shadow looming over Binky.
*Pledge of Allegiance: Bongo&#x27;s class is forced to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Bongo intentionally butchers the Pledge, usually criticizing the government in the process (&quot;and to the Republicans which I can&#x27;t stand&quot;). One strip, released after the death of musician Frank Zappa in 1993, has Bongo replacing most of the words of the Pledge with names of Zappa albums (&quot;With yellow sharks and hot rats for all&quot;). The comic would always end with Bongo&#x27;s teacher angrily leering at him, and often Bongo would be tied to his desk and gagged as punishment.
*Forbidden Words – An annual compilation of buzzwords used over the past year that Groening has deemed &quot;forbidden&quot;. This topic was the first ever comic by Groening, published in 1980. These also appear in &quot;Simpsons&quot; annuals.
*&quot;How to draw Binky&quot; - Often comedic ways on how to draw Binky, usually one of which is drawing randomly with your eyes closed.

==Merchandise and advertising==
After the success of &quot;Love Is Hell&quot;, Deborah Caplan, later Groening&#x27;s wife, published &quot;Work Is Hell&quot; and two calendars, one in collaboration with cartoonist Lynda Barry. The books caught the attention of Pantheon/Randomhouse who wanted to expand the market for his books to include bookstores nationwide. The Life in Hell Cartoon Co. reserved the right to continue to sell the books to hip novelty and comic book stores along with the line of novelty items the couple had produced over the previous 5 years.

In addition to the books, the comic also spawned T-shirts, sweatshirts, greeting cards, posters, coffee mugs, and a short-lived newsletter called the &quot;Life in Hell Times&quot;.

In the late 1980s, Groening drew several print advertisements for Apple Computer in the form of &quot;Life in Hell&quot; comic strips.

In 1989, after the birth of their first son, Deborah Caplan Groening and Matt decided to end their business because Deborah wanted to focus on motherhood and Matt was launching his career in television.

At the 2005 Comic-Con in San Diego, a series of deluxe &quot;Life in Hell&quot; vinyl figurines manufactured by CritterBox Toys was announced.

Binky and Bongo appear as background and enemy characters in the Simpsons arcade video game (coin-op).

<text>A roller coaster inversion is a roller coaster element in which the track turns riders upside-down and then returns them to an upright position. Early forms of inversions were circular in nature and date back to 1848 on the Centrifugal railway in Paris. These vertical loops produced massive g-force that was often dangerous to riders. As a result, the element eventually became non-existent with the last rides to feature the looping inversions being dismantled during the Great Depression. In 1975, designers from Arrow Development created the corkscrew, reviving interest in the inversion during the modern age of steel roller coasters. Elements have since evolved from simple corkscrews and vertical loops to more complex inversions such as Immelmann loops and cobra rolls. The Smiler at Alton Towers holds the world record for the number of inversions on a roller coaster with 14.

== History ==

=== Prototypes (1848–1903) ===

The first inversion in roller coaster history was part of the Centrifugal Railway of Paris, France, built in 1848. It consisted of a sloping track leading into a nearly circular vertical loop in diameter. During the early 1900s, many rides including vertical loops appeared around the world. These early loops had a major design flaw: the circular structure produced intense g-forces (hereafter &quot;Gs&quot;). The Flip Flap Railway, designed by Lina Beecher and built in 1895 on Coney Island of Brooklyn, United States, had a 25-foot circular loop at the end which though initially popular caused some discomfort in passenger&#x27;s necks, and the ride soon closed. Loop the Loop, another looping coaster, was built later in Coney Island as well. This time the loops were slightly oval-shaped rather than circular, though not clothoid in shape like modern loops. Although the ride was safe, it had a low capacity, loading four people every five minutes (48 people per hour, compared to 1800 riders per hour on Corkscrew, an early modern coaster that opened in 1976), and was poorly received after the discomfort of the Flip Flap Railway. As their novelty wore off and their dangerous reputation spread, compounded with the developing Great Depression, the early looping coasters disappeared.

=== Corkscrew (1968–1976) ===

The concept of inverting riders was not revisited until the 1970s. In 1968, Karl Bacon of Arrow Dynamics created a prototype steel roller coaster with a corkscrew, the first of its kind. The prototype proved that a tubular steel track, first pioneered by Arrow to create Disneyland&#x27;s Matterhorn Bobsleds in 1959, could execute inversions both safely and reliably. The full model of the prototype, aptly named Corkscrew, was then installed in Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm in Buena Park, United States, making history as the world&#x27;s first modern inverting roller coaster (it was relocated to Silverwood Park of Idaho in 1990). In 1976, the previously disastrous vertical loop was successfully revived when Anton Schwarzkopf constructed the Great American Revolution at Six Flags Magic Mountain of Valencia, United States, which became the world&#x27;s first complete circuit looping roller coaster. Another roller coaster named Corkscrew, built in Cedar Point of Ohio in the same year, became the first with three inversions.

=== Inversions (1977–present) ===

The next few years brought innovations that are still popular in modern coasters. The shuttle roller coaster (non-complete circuit) was invented by Schwarzkopf in 1977 and realized at Kings Island with the Screamin&#x27; Demon coaster. These early incarnations used the weight-drop mechanism (as opposed to the later flywheel methods) to launch the trains. Built in 1978, the Loch Ness Monster in Busch Gardens Williamsburg became the first coaster with interlocking loops.
It is still the only coaster with this feature, as the only other coasters containing interlocking loops are now defunct: Lightnin&#x27; Loops, built by Arrow in Six Flags Great Adventure, was sold in 1992, and Orient Express of Worlds of Fun was demolished in 2003. The first Schwarzkopf shuttle loops with a flywheel launch also first appeared in 1978. Arrow&#x27;s Revolution, Europe&#x27;s first looping coaster, was built in 1979 at Blackpool Pleasure Beach of England. In 1980, Carolina Cyclone opened at Carowinds as the first roller coaster with four inversions. The Orient Express opened at Worlds of Fun of Kansas City, United States, in 1980, with the newly invented batwing (not to be confused with a boomerang), a single track element with two inversions.

In 1981, Vekoma invented the Boomerang coaster model, which became the most duplicated roller coaster ever. The first Boomerang was built at Reino Aventura (now Six Flags México) of Mexico City, Mexico in 1982. The Boomerang has had over 50 clones built worldwide from Doha, Qatar, to Tashkent, Uzbekistan. 1982 also brought the first five-inversion coaster, Arrow&#x27;s Viper at Darien Lake in Darien, New York.

The record for number of inversions was broken quickly in the following years. Arrow&#x27;s Vortex at Kings Island, built in 1987, was the first to have six. The next year, Shockwave at Six Flags Great America broke that record with seven inversions. In 1995, Dragon Khan in Spain&#x27;s Port Aventura became the first to have eight. In 2002, Colossus at Thorpe Park in Chertsey, Surrey, England was the first with ten. In 2013, The Smiler at Alton Towers in Staffordshire, England, broke the record again with 14 inversions.

In 2000, Kings Island built Son of Beast, the world&#x27;s first wooden roller coaster with a vertical loop. Until then, all roller coasters with any inversions were steel. After structural problems caused an incident in July 2006 that injured several riders, Son of Beast&#x27;s loop was removed in December 2006 to make it possible to use lighter trains.

In 2002, X, now X2, designed by Arrow, opened in Six Flags Magic Mountain. It is marketed as the world&#x27;s first fourth-dimension roller coaster, capable of rotating riders upside-down independently of any track elements. This adds difficulty in delineating the number of inversions such rides have. As the riders physically rotate 360 degrees forward and backwards, proponents insist the number of inversions should not include only track elements. According to Guinness World Records, the roller coaster with the most inversions counted this way is Eejanaika (, Ain&#x27;t it great?), another 4th Dimension roller coaster, in Fuji-Q Highland of Fujiyoshida, Japan, which rotates riders 14 times. Counting only track elements, however, Alton Tower&#x27;s The Smiler has the world record for number of inversions, also rotating riders 14 times.

Two or more wooden roller coasters with inversions opened in each of 2013, 2014, and 2017. As opposed to the vertical loop that Son of Beast had, Outlaw Run and Hades 360, Mine Blower and Goliath (at Six Flags Great America) have more complex inversions. Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City has a double barrel roll and a 153° over-banked turn, and Hades 360 has a single corkscrew. Other elements which partially invert riders, such as the overbanked turn which occasionally turn riders beyond 90 degrees, are not typically considered inversions.

<doc id="630247" wikidata="Q494757" url="?curid=630247" title="Fourteener">
<text>In the mountaineering parlance of the Western United States, a fourteener (also spelled 14er) is a mountain peak with an elevation of at least . The 96 fourteeners in the United States are all west of the Mississippi River. Colorado has the most (53) of any single state; Alaska is second with 29. Many peak baggers try to climb all fourteeners in the contiguous United States, one particular state, or another region.

== Qualification criteria ==
The summit of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#Topographic elevation is the height of the summit above a geodetic sea level.
#Topographic prominence is how high the summit rises above its surroundings.
#Topographic isolation (or radius of dominance) is how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.

Not all summits over 14,000 feet qualify as fourteeners. Summits that qualify are those considered by mountaineers to be independent. Objective standards for independence include topographic prominence and isolation (distance from a higher summit), or a combination of the two. However, fourteener lists do not always use such objective rules consistently.

A rule commonly used by mountaineers in the contiguous United States is that a peak must have at least of prominence to qualify. By this rule, Colorado has 53 fourteeners, California has 12, and Washington has 2.

According to the Mountaineering Club of Alaska, the standard in Alaska uses a prominence rule rather than a rule. By this rule, Alaska has at least 21 peaks over and its 12 highest peaks exceed .

==Fourteeners==
The following table lists the 96 mountain peaks of the United States with at least of topographic elevation and at least of topographic prominence]. Of these, 53 rise in Colorado, 29 in Alaska, 12 in California, and 2 in Washington (Liberty Cap is part of the crater atop Mt Rainier). The 22 highest fourteeners all rise in Alaska.


==Topographic prominence==
The table above uses a minimum topographic prominence criterion of and includes 96 peaks. The number of peaks included depends upon the minimum topographic prominence criterion. A criterion of includes 90 peaks, includes 77 peaks, includes 63 peaks, and includes 46 peaks.

The following U.S. summits have 14,000 ft of elevation, but have less than 300 ft of topographic prominence:
* Denali, Browne Tower, 14,530, Alaska: Prominence = . Why this became included on some fourteener lists is unclear.
* Mount Cameron, 14,238, Colorado: Prominence = 118 feet.
* El Diente Peak, 14,159, Colorado: Prominence = 239 feet. On many fourteener lists.
* Point Success, 14,158, Washington: Prominence = 118 feet.
* Polemonium Peak, 14,080+, California: Prominence = 160–240 feet.
* Starlight Peak, 14,080, California: Prominence = 80–160 feet.
* North Conundrum Peak, 14,040+, Colorado: Prominence = 200–280 feet.
* North Eolus, 14,039, Colorado: Prominence = 159–199 feet.
* North Maroon Peak, 14,014, Colorado: Official Prominence = 234 feet. On many fourteener lists, partially due to analysis with higher-resolution topographic data suggesting its true prominence is greater than 300 feet.
* Thunderbolt Peak, 14,003, California: Prominence = 223 feet.
* Sunlight Spire, 14,001, Colorado: Prominence = 195–235 feet.

<text>The zuihuai () is a specimen of the pagoda tree (&quot;Styphnolobium japonicum&quot;) located in Jingshan Park, Beijing, China. It is a tourist attraction and national landmark in Jingshan Park. The Chongzhen Emperor Zhu Youjian, the last ruler of the Ming dynasty, allegedly hanged himself from the tree in 1644 after the imperial capital, Beijing, fell to rebel forces led by Li Zicheng. Eventually the Ming was destroyed, Li Zhicheng&#x27;s forces were defeated, and the Qing dynasty was established in China.

The original tree has been replaced numerous times. The current tree is a 150 year old replacement, replanted in 1996.

<text>Forté Agent was an email and Usenet news client used on the Windows operating system. Agent was conceived, designed and developed by Mark Sidell and the team at Forté Internet Software in 1994 to address the need for an online/offline newsreader which capitalized on the emerging Windows GUI framework. By 1995, Agent had expanded to become a full-featured email client and remains a widely used application for integrating news and email communication on Windows. Agent supports POP email but not IMAP.

Agent&#x27;s Usenet features include access to multiple news servers, import/export of NZB files, threaded discussions and a highly configurable user interface which has been criticized as difficult to use. It has long supported yEnc as well as many other coding schemes, and has the capability of joining incomplete binary attachments, which is useful in the event of posting errors.

In the past, a free version was offered alongside the commercial one. The free version lacked some features of the commercial version or, later, had them disabled until a registration key was entered. The last free version was 3.3.

==Forté Internet Software==
Originally called Forte Advanced Management Systems, Forté Internet Software, produced in the 1980s and 1990s enterprise-level products including network optimization and station administration tools that were licensed by Nortel Networks. In 1996, Forté created Adante, software for managing high volumes of inbound corporate email.

In late 1997, Forté was acquired by Genesys Telecommunications (which was then purchased by Alcatel) to integrate Adante into the Genesys and Alcatel product lines. In 2000, Alcatel sold Forte&#x27;s Consumer Software Group to Charles Dazler Knuff. Now known as Forté Internet Software, this group continues to develop Agent and to research the areas of social software, email and wireless communications using trust networks.

In 2003, Forté created Forté Internet Services, which offers Agent Premium Newsgroups (APN), a high-speed, high-retention Usenet news service.

<doc id="630260" wikidata="Q119515" url="?curid=630260" title="Canada–United States border">
<text>The international border between Canada and the United States is the longest in the world by total length. The boundary (including boundaries in the Great Lakes, Atlantic, and Pacific coasts) is long. The land border has two sections: Canada&#x27;s border with the contiguous United States to its south, and with the U.S. state of Alaska to its west. The bi-national International Boundary Commission deals with matters relating to marking and maintaining the boundary, and the International Joint Commission deals with issues concerning boundary waters. The agencies responsible for facilitating legal passage through the international boundary are the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

==History==
===18th century===

The Treaty of Paris of 1783 ended the American Revolutionary War between Great Britain and the United States. In the second article of the Treaty, the parties agreed on all boundaries of the United States, including, but not limited to, the boundary to the north along what was then British North America. The agreed-upon boundary included the line from the northwest angle of Nova Scotia to the northwesternmost head of the Connecticut River and proceeded down along the middle of the river to the 45th parallel of north latitude.

The parallel had been established in the 1760s as the boundary between the provinces of Quebec and New York (including what would later become the State of Vermont). It was surveyed and marked by John Collins and Thomas Valentine from 1771 to 1773.

The St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes became the boundary further west, between the United States and what is now Ontario. Northwest of Lake Superior, the boundary followed rivers to the Lake of the Woods. From the northwesternmost point of the Lake of the Woods, the boundary was agreed to go straight west until it met the Mississippi River. That line never meets the river since the river&#x27;s source is farther south.

====Jay Treaty (1794)====
The Jay Treaty of 1794 (effective 1796) created the International Boundary Commission, which was charged with surveying and mapping the boundary. It also provided for the removal of British forces from Detroit, as well as other frontier outposts on the U.S. side. The Jay Treaty was superseded by the Treaty of Ghent (effective 1815) concluding the War of 1812, which included pre-war boundaries.

===19th century===

Signed in December 1814, the Treaty of Ghent ended the War of 1812, returning the boundaries of British North America and the United States to the state they were before the war. In the following decades, the United States and the United Kingdom concluded several treaties that settled the major boundary disputes between the two, enabling the border to be demilitarized. The Rush–Bagot Treaty of 1817 provided a plan for demilitarizing the two combatant sides in the War of 1812 and also laid out preliminary principles for drawing a border between British North America and the United States.

==== London Convention (1818) ====
The Treaty of 1818 saw the expansion of both British North America and the United States, with their boundary extending westward along the 49th parallel, from the Northwest Angle at Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains. While the Laurentian Divide had previously been agreed to as a border, the flatness of the terrain made it difficult to locate this line. The treaty extinguished British claims to the south of the 49th in the Red River Valley, which was part of Rupert&#x27;s Land. The treaty also extinguished U.S. claims to land north of the 49th in the watershed of the Missouri River, which was part of the Louisiana Purchase. Along the 49th parallel, the border vista is theoretically straight, but in practice follows the 19th-century surveyed border markers and varies by several hundred feet in spots.

==== Webster–Ashburton Treaty (1842) ====

Disputes over the interpretation of the border treaties and mistakes in surveying required additional negotiations, which resulted in the Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842. The treaty resolved the Aroostook War, a dispute over the boundary between Maine, New Brunswick, and the Province of Canada. The treaty redefined the border between New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York on the one hand, and the Province of Canada on the other, resolving the Indian Stream dispute and the Fort Blunder dilemma at the outlet to Lake Champlain.

The part of the 45th parallel that separates Quebec from the U.S. states of Vermont and New York had first been surveyed from 1771 to 1773 after it had been declared the boundary between New York (including what later became Vermont) and Quebec. It was surveyed again after the War of 1812. The U.S. federal government began to construct fortifications just south of the border at Rouses Point, New York, on Lake Champlain. After a significant portion of the construction was completed, measurements revealed that at that point, the actual 45th parallel was three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) south of the surveyed line. The fort, which became known as &quot;Fort Blunder&quot;, was in Canada, which created a dilemma for the U.S. that was not resolved until a provision of the treaty left the border on the meandering line as surveyed. The border along the Boundary Waters in present-day Ontario and Minnesota between Lake Superior and the Northwest Angle was also redefined.

==== Oregon Treaty (1846) ====
An 1844 boundary dispute during the Presidency of James K. Polk led to a call for the northern boundary of the U.S. west of the Rockies to be 54°40′N related to the southern boundary of Russia&#x27;s Alaska Territory. However, Great Britain wanted a border that followed the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean. The dispute was resolved in the Oregon Treaty of 1846, which established the 49th parallel as the boundary through the Rockies.

==== Boundary surveys (mid–19th century) ====
The Northwest Boundary Survey (1857–1861) laid out the land boundary. However, the water boundary was not settled for some time. After the Pig War in 1859, arbitration in 1872 established the border between the Gulf Islands and the San Juan Islands.

The International Boundary Survey (or, the &quot;Northern Boundary Survey&quot; in the U.S.) began in 1872. Its mandate was to establish the border as agreed to in the Treaty of 1818. Archibald Campbell led the way for the United States, while Donald Cameron, supported by chief astronomer Samuel Anderson, headed the British team. This survey focused on the border from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountains.

===20th century===

In 1903, following a dispute that arose because of the Klondike Gold Rush, a joint United Kingdom–Canada–U.S. tribunal established the boundary of southeast Alaska.

On April 11, 1908, the United Kingdom and the United States agreed, under Article IV of the Treaty of 1908 &quot;concerning the boundary between the United States and the Dominion of Canada from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean&quot;, to survey and delimit the boundary between Canada and the U.S. through the St. Lawrence River and Great Lakes, by modern surveying techniques, and thus accomplished several changes to the border. In 1925, the International Boundary Commission&#x27;s temporary mission became permanent for maintaining the survey and mapping of the border; maintaining boundary monuments and buoys; and keeping the border clear of brush and vegetation for . This &quot;border vista&quot; extends for on each side of the line.

In 1909, under the Boundary Waters Treaty, the International Joint Commission was established for Canada and the U.S. to investigate and approve projects that affect the waters and waterways along the border.

===21st century===
As a result of the 2001 September 11 attacks, the U.S. declared a level 1 alert at its borders, which required intrusive inspections of all crossing vehicles and passengers, resulting in considerable border congestion.
Canada&#x27;s Chrétien government worked with the U.S. Bush administration to make the border both more secure and less of an impediment for high-value goods and low-risk travellers, and on 12 December 2001 the &quot;Smart Border Declaration&quot; was signed.
The agreement pioneered border innovations that have become common worldwide, such as cargo and passenger preclearance, the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program, and the NEXUS trusted traveller program.

The mutual cooperation established by the &quot;Smart Border&quot; initiative made it easier to restrict border traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

==== 2020–2021 closure ====

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada and the United States, the governments of Canada and the United States agreed to close the border to &quot;non-essential&quot; travel on March 21, 2020, for an initial period of 30 days.
The closure was extended 15 times. In mid-June 2021, the Canadian government announced it would ease some entry requirements for fully vaccinated Canadian citizens, permanent residents, and foreign nationals starting on July 5.
The closure finally expired on July 21. In mid-July, the Canadian government announced that fully vaccinated American citizens and permanent residents could visit Canada starting August 9. The American government reopened its land border to fully vaccinated Canadian citizens effective November 8. The 2020–21 closure was reportedly the first long-term blanket closure of the border since the War of 1812.

Business advocacy groups, noting the substantial economic impact of the closure on both sides of the border, called for more nuanced restrictions in place of the blanket ban on non-essential travel. The Northern Border Caucus, a group in the U.S. Congress composed of members from border communities, made similar suggestions to the governments of both countries. Beyond the closure itself, US President Donald Trump also initially suggested the idea of deploying United States military personnel near the border with Canada in connection with the pandemic. He later abandoned the idea following vocal opposition from Canadian officials.

== Security ==
=== Law enforcement approach ===
The International Boundary is commonly said to be the world&#x27;s &quot;longest undefended border&quot;, though this is true only in the military sense, as civilian law enforcement is present. It is illegal to cross the border outside border controls, as anyone crossing the border must be checked per immigration and customs laws. The relatively low level of security measures stands in contrast to that of the United States–Mexico border (which is one-third the length of the Canada–U.S. border), which is actively patrolled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel to prevent illegal migration and drug trafficking.

Parts of the International Boundary cross through mountainous terrain or heavily forested areas, but significant portions also cross remote prairie farmland and the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, in addition to the maritime components of the boundary at the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic oceans. The border also runs through the middle of the Mohawk Nation at Akwesasne and even divides some buildings found in communities in New England and Quebec.

The US Customs and Border Protection identifies the chief issues along the border as domestic and international terrorism; drug smuggling and smuggling of products (such as tobacco) to evade customs duties; and illegal immigration. A June 2019 U.S. Government Accountability Office report identified specific staffing and resource shortfalls faced by the CBP on the Northern border that adversely affect enforcement actions; the U.S. Border Patrol &quot;identified an insufficient number of agents that limited patrol missions along the northern border&quot; while CBP Air and Marine Operations &quot;identified an insufficient number of agents along the northern border, which limited the number and frequency of air and maritime missions.&quot;

There are eight U.S. Border Patrol sectors based on the Canada–U.S. border, each covering a designated &quot;area of responsibility&quot;; the sectors are (from west to east) based in Blaine, Washington; Spokane, Washington; Havre, Montana; Grand Forks, North Dakota; Detroit, Michigan; Buffalo, New York; Swanton, Vermont; and Houlton, Maine.

Following the September 11 attacks in the United States, security along the border was dramatically tightened by the two countries in both populated and rural areas. Both nations are also actively involved in detailed and extensive tactical and strategic intelligence sharing.

In December 2010, Canada and the United States were negotiating an agreement titled &quot;Beyond the Border: A Shared Vision for Perimeter Security and Competitiveness&quot; which would give the U.S. more influence over Canada&#x27;s border security and immigration controls, and more information would be shared by Canada with the U.S.

=== Security measures ===

Residents of both nations who own property adjacent to the border are forbidden to build within the boundary vista without permission from the International Boundary Commission. They are required to report such construction to their respective governments.

All persons crossing the border are required to report to the customs agency of the country they have entered. Where necessary, fences or vehicle blockades are used. In remote areas, where staffed border crossings are not available, there are hidden sensors on roads, trails, railways, and wooded areas, which are located near crossing points. There is no border zone; the U.S. Customs and Border Protection routinely sets up checkpoints as far as into U.S. territory.

In August 2020, the United States constructed of short cable fencing along the border between Abbotsford, British Columbia, and Whatcom County, Washington.

==== Identification ====
Before 2007, American and Canadian citizens were only required to produce a birth certificate and driver&#x27;s license/government-issued identification card when crossing the Canada–United States border.

However, in late 2006, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the final rule of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI), which pertained to new identification requirements for travelers entering the United States. This rule, which marked the first phase of the initiative, was implemented on January 23, 2007, specifying six forms of identification acceptable for crossing the U.S. border (depending on mode):

* a valid passport—required to enter by air;
* a United States passport card;
* an enhanced driver&#x27;s license—issued by the U.S. States of Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, and Washington, as well as the Canadian Provinces of British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec;
* a trusted traveler program card (i.e. NEXUS, FAST, or SENTRI); 
* a valid Merchant Mariner Credential—to be used when traveling in conjunction with official maritime business; and
* a valid U.S. military identification card—to be used when traveling on official orders.

The requirement of a passport or an enhanced form of identification to enter the United States by air went into effect in January 2007; and went into effect for those entering the U.S. by land and sea in January 2008. Although the new requirements for land and sea entry went into legal effect in January 2008, its enforcement did not begin until June 2009. Since June 2009, every traveler arriving via a land or sea port-of-entry (including ferries) has been required to present one of the above forms of identification to enter the United States.

Conversely, to cross into Canada, a traveler must also carry identification, as well as a valid visa (if necessary) when crossing the border. Forms of identification include a valid passport, a Canadian Emergency Travel Document, an enhanced driver&#x27;s license issued by a Canadian province or territory, or an enhanced identification/photo card issued by a Canadian province or territory. Several other documents may be used by Canadians to identify their citizenship at the border, although such documents must be supported with additional photo identification.

American and Canadian citizens who are members of a trusted traveler program such as FAST or NEXUS, may present their FAST or NEXUS card as an alternate form of identification when crossing the international boundary by land or sea, or when arriving by air from only Canada or the United States. Although permanent residents of Canada and the United States are eligible for FAST or NEXUS, they are required to travel with a passport and proof of permanent residency upon arrival at the Canadian border. American permanent residents who are NEXUS members also require Electronic Travel Authorization when crossing the Canadian border.

===Security issues===
==== Smuggling ====
Smuggling of alcoholic beverages (&quot;rum running&quot;) was widespread during the 1920s, when Prohibition was in effect nationally in the United States and parts of Canada.

In more recent years, Canadian officials have brought attention to drug, cigarette, and firearm smuggling from the United States, while U.S. officials have made complaints of drug smuggling via Canada. In July 2005, law enforcement personnel arrested three men who had built a tunnel under the border between British Columbia and Washington, intended for the use of smuggling marijuana, the first such tunnel known on this border. From 2007 to 2010, 147 people were arrested for smuggling marijuana on the property of a bed-and-breakfast in Blaine, Washington, but agents estimate that they caught only about 5% of smugglers.

Because of its location, Cornwall, Ontario, experiences ongoing smuggling—mostly of tobacco and firearms from the United States. The neighboring Mohawk territory of Akwesasne straddles the Ontario–Quebec–New York borders, where its First Nations sovereignty prevents Ontario Provincial Police, Sûreté du Québec, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada Border Services Agency, Canadian Coast Guard, United States Border Patrol, United States Coast Guard, and New York State Police from exercising jurisdiction over exchanges taking place within the territory.

==== 2009 border occupation ====
In May 2009, the Mohawk people of Akwesasne occupied the area around the Canada Border Services Agency port of entry building to protest the Canadian government&#x27;s decision to arm its border agents while operating on Mohawk territory. The north span of the Seaway International Bridge and the CBSA inspection facilities were closed. During this occupation, the Canadian flag was replaced with the flag of the Mohawk people. Although U.S. Customs remained open to southbound traffic, northbound traffic was blocked on the U.S. side by both American and Canadian officials. The Canadian border at this crossing remained closed for six weeks. On July 13, 2009, the CBSA opened a temporary inspection station at the north end of the north span of the bridge in the city of Cornwall, allowing traffic to once again flow in both directions.

The Mohawk people of Akwesasne have staged ongoing protests at this border. In 2014, they objected to a process that made their crossing more tedious, believing it violated their treaty rights of free passage. When traveling from the U.S. to Cornwall Island, they must first cross a second bridge into Canada, for inspection at the new Canadian border station. Discussions between inter-governmental agencies were being pursued on the feasibility of relocating the Canadian border inspection facilities on the U.S. side of the border.

==== 2017 border crossing crisis ====

In August 2017, the border between Quebec and New York saw an influx of up to 500 irregular crossings each day, by individuals seeking asylum in Canada. As a result, Canada increased border security and immigration staffing in the area, reiterating the fact that crossing the border irregularly did not affect one&#x27;s asylum status.

From the beginning of January 2017 up until the end of March 2018, the RCMP intercepted 25,645 people crossing the border into Canada from an unauthorized point of entry. Public Safety Canada estimates another 2,500 came across in April 2018 for a total of just over 28,000.

== Border lengths and regions ==

The length of the terrestrial boundary is , of which is against the contiguous 48 states, and against Alaska. Eight out of thirteen provinces and territories of Canada and thirteen out of fifty U.S. states are located along this international boundary.

=== Yukon ===
The Canadian territory of Yukon shares its entire western border with the U.S. state of Alaska, beginning at the Beaufort Sea at and proceeding southwards along the 141st meridian west. At 60°18′N, the border proceeds away from the 141st meridian west in a southeastward direction, following the Saint Elias Mountains. South of the 60th parallel north, the border continues into British Columbia.

=== British Columbia ===

British Columbia has two international borders with the United States: with the state of Alaska along BC&#x27;s northwest, and with the contiguous United States along the southern edge of the province, including (west to east) Washington, Idaho, and Montana.

BC&#x27;s Alaskan border, continuing from Yukon&#x27;s, proceeds through the Saint Elias Mountains, followed by Mount Fairweather at (near the Fairweather Glacier), where the border heads northwestward towards the Coast Mountains. At (near Skagway, Alaska), the border begins a general southeastward direction along the Coast Mountains. The border eventually reaches the Portland Canal and follows it outward to the Dixon Entrance, which takes the border down and out into the Pacific Ocean, terminating it upon reaching international waters.

BC&#x27;s border along the contiguous U.S. begins southwest of Vancouver Island and northwest of the Olympic Peninsula, at the terminus of international waters in the Pacific Ocean and the northwest corner of the American state of Washington. It follows the Strait of Juan de Fuca eastward, turning northeastward to enter Haro Strait. The border follows the strait in a northward direction, but turns sharply eastward through Boundary Pass, separating the Canadian Gulf Islands from the American San Juan Islands. Upon reaching the Strait of Georgia, the border turns due north and then towards the northwest, bisecting the strait until the 49th parallel north. After making a sharp turn eastbound, the border follows this parallel across the Tsawwassen Peninsula, separating Point Roberts, Washington, from Delta, British Columbia, and continues into Alberta.

=== Prairies ===

The entire Canada–U.S. border in the provinces of both Alberta and Saskatchewan lies along the 49th parallel north. Both provinces share borders with the state of Montana, while, farther east, Saskatchewan also shares a border with North Dakota. On the American side, the states of Montana, North Dakota, and Minnesota all lie on the straight part of the border.

Along with the U.S. states of North Dakota and Minnesota (west to east), nearly the entire Canada–U.S. border in Manitoba lies along the 49th parallel north. At the province&#x27;s eastern end, however, the border briefly enters the Lake of the Woods, turning north at where it continues into the land along the western end of Minnesota&#x27;s Northwest Angle, the only part of the United States besides the state of Alaska that is north of the 49th parallel. The border reaches Ontario at .

=== Ontario ===

The province of Ontario shares its border (west to east) with the U.S. states of Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. The largest provincial international border, most of the border is a water boundary. It begins at the north-westernmost point of Minnesota&#x27;s Northwest Angle.(49°23′N 95°09′W). From here, it proceeds eastward through the Angle Inlet into the Lake of the Woods, turning southward at (near Dawson Township, Ontario) where it continues into the Rainy River. The border follows the River to Rainy Lake, then subsequently through various smaller lakes, including Namakan Lake, Lac la Croix, and Sea Gull Lake. The border then crosses the Height of Land Portage over the divide between the Hudson Bay drainage basin, and that of the Great Lakes. The boundary then follows the Pigeon River, which leads it out into Lake Superior. The border continues through Lake Superior and Whitefish Bay, into the St. Mary&#x27;s River then the North Channel. At (between Drummond Township, Michigan, to the west and Cockburn Island (Ontario) to the east), the border turns southward into the False Detour Channel, from which it reaches Lake Huron. Through the Lake, the border heads southward until reaching the St. Clair River, leading it to Lake St. Clair. The border proceeds through Lake St. Clair, reaching the Detroit River, which leads it to Lake Erie, where it begins turning northeast. From Lake Erie, the border is led into the Niagara River, which takes it into Lake Ontario. From here, the boundary heads northwestward until it reaches , where it makes a sharp turn towards the northeast. The border then reaches the St. Lawrence River, proceeding through it until finally, at (between Massena, New York, and Cornwall, Ontario), the border splits from the river and continues into Quebec.

=== Quebec ===
The province of Quebec borders (west to east) the U.S. states of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, beginning where the Ontario-New York border ends in the St. Lawrence River at the 45th parallel north. The Quebec-New York border heads inland towards the east, remaining on or near the parallel, becoming the border of Vermont. At (the tripoint of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Quebec), the border begins to follow various natural features of the Appalachian Mountains as it turns into the border of Maine. It continues to do so until (near Saint-Camille-de-Lellis, Quebec, on the Canadian side, and unorganized territory on the American side), where it heads north, then northeastward at (near Lac-Frontière, Quebec). Finally, at (near Pohénégamook, Quebec), the border heads toward Beau Lake, going through it and continuing into New Brunswick.

=== New Brunswick ===
The entire border of New Brunswick is shared with the U.S. state of Maine, beginning at the southern tip of Beau Lake at (between Rivière-Bleue, Quebec, and Saint-François Parish, New Brunswick), subsequently proceeding to the Saint John River. The border moves through the River until (between Hamlin, Maine, and Grand Falls, New Brunswick), where it splits from the river. It heads southward to (near Amity, Maine), from whence it follows the Monument Brook further south into the Chiputneticook Lakes, which subsequently leads the border to the St. Croix River. The border proceeds through the St. Croix to Passamaquoddy Bay, which then leads it to Grand Manan Island into the middle of the Bay of Fundy. Here, the border turns towards the south and terminates upon reaching international waters.

==Crossings and border straddling==
=== Airports ===

United States Customs and Border Protection maintains pre-clearance facilities at nine Canadian airports with nonstop air service to the United States: Calgary; Edmonton; Halifax Stanfield; Montreal–Trudeau; Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier; Toronto-Bishop, Toronto–Pearson, Vancouver; and Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson. These procedures expedite travel by allowing flights originating in Canada to land at a U.S. airport without being processed as an international arrival. Canada does not maintain equivalent personnel at U.S. airports due to the limited number of Canada-bound flights from U.S. locations.

Both New York LaGuardia (LGA) and Washington National (DCA) airports lack immigration and customs inspection facilities. However, U.S. pre-clearance facilities in Toronto and Montreal permit nonstop service to New York and Washington.

====Cross-border airports====
The Canada–U.S. border has six airports and eleven seaplane bases whose runways straddle the borderline. Such airports were built before the U.S. entry into World War II as a way to legally transfer U.S.-built aircraft, such as the Lockheed Hudson, to Canada under the provisions of the &quot;Lend-Lease Act&quot;. In the interest of maintaining neutrality, U.S. military pilots were forbidden to deliver combat aircraft to Canada. As a result, the aircraft were flown to the border, where they landed, and then were towed on their wheels over the border by tractors or horses overnight. The next day, the planes were crewed by RCAF pilots and flown to other locations, typically airbases in Eastern Canada and Newfoundland.The planes were flown flown to the United Kingdom and deployed in the Battle of Britain.

Piney Pinecreek Border Airport is located in Piney, Manitoba, and Pinecreek, Minnesota. The northwest–southeast-oriented runway straddles the border, and there are two ramps: one in the U.S. and one in Canada. The airport is owned by the Minnesota Department of Transportation.

International Peace Garden Airport is located in Boissevain, Manitoba, and Dunseith, North Dakota, adjacent to the International Peace Garden. The runway is entirely within North Dakota, but a ramp extends across the border to allow aircraft to access Canadian customs. While not jointly owned, it is operated as an international facility for customs clearance as part of the Peace Garden.

Coronach/Scobey Border Station Airport (or East Poplar Airport) is located in Coronach, Saskatchewan, and Scobey, Montana. The airport is jointly owned by the Canadian and U.S. governments, with its east-west runway sited exactly on the borderline.

Coutts/Ross International Airport is located in Alberta and Montana. Like Coronach/Scobey, the east-west runway is sited exactly on the border. The airport is owned entirely by the Montana Department of Transportation (DOT) Aeronautics Division.

Del Bonita/Whetstone International Airport, located in Del Bonita, Alberta, and Del Bonita, Montana, has an east-west runway sited exactly on the border, similar to Coutts/Ross. The airport is officially owned by the state of Montana and run by the state&#x27;s DOT Aeronautics Division, thus it has been assigned a U.S. identifier only. The facility is set up for both the general public (15 passengers maximum per plane) as well as the American military.

Avey Field State Airport is located in Washington and British Columbia. The privately owned airfield is mostly in the U.S., but several hundred feet of the north-south runway extend into Canada. As such, both Canadian and U.S. customs are available. It is assigned a U.S. identifier but does not have a Canadian one.

Several seaplane bases have water runways that cross the border, though the extent to which they do may be difficult to ascertain. The land-based facilities for the bases are all contained within one country or the other, however, leading to multiple situations where twin seaplane bases may share the same body of water. The following seaplane facilities exist on the border:

* Rouses Point SPB (New York / Quebec)
* Van Buren SPB (Maine / New Brunswick)
* Sault Ste Marie SPB and Sault Ste. Marie Water Aerodrome (Michigan / Ontario)
* Sand Point Lake Water Aerodrome (Minnesota / Ontario)
* International Falls SPB and Fort Frances Water Aerodrome (Minnesota / Ontario)
* Baudette International Airport and Rainy River Water Aerodrome (Minnesota / Ontario)
* Hyder Seaplane Base and Stewart Water Aerodrome (Alaska / British Columbia)

===Land border crossings===

Currently, there are 119 legal land border crossings between the United States and Canada, 26 of which take place at a bridge or tunnel. Only 2 of the 119 crossings are one-way: the Churubusco–Franklin Centre Border Crossing, where travelers may enter only the United States; and the Four Falls Border Crossing, where travelers may enter only Canada.

Six roads have unstaffed road crossings, and do not have border inspection services in one or both directions, where travelers are legally allowed to cross the border. Those who cross are required to report to customs, which are stationed farther within.

==== Trail crossings ====
The Fourth Connecticut Lake Trail (New Hampshire/Quebec) crosses several times while following the border vista before heading back to the United States.

The Pacific Crest Trail crosses into E. C. Manning Provincial Park in the remote North Cascades mountains. Hikers can only legally cross into Canada from the U.S. and not vice versa, requiring an advance permit.
===== Rail crossings =====
There are 39 railroads that cross the U.S.–Canada border, nine of which are no longer in use. Eleven of these railroads cross the border at a bridge or tunnel.

Only three international rail lines currently carry passengers between the U.S. and Canada. At Vancouver&#x27;s Pacific Central Station, passengers are required to pass through U.S. partial pre-clearance and pass their baggage through an X-ray machine before being allowed to board the Seattle-bound Amtrak &quot;Cascades&quot; train, which makes no further stops before crossing the border at Blaine, Washington, where the train stops for another CBP inspection. Pre-clearance facilities are not available for the popular &quot;Adirondack&quot; (New York City to Montreal) or &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; (New York City to Toronto) trains, since these lines have stops between Montreal or Toronto and the border. Instead, passengers must clear customs at a stop located at the actual border.

=== Seaports ===

There are 13 international ferry crossings operating between the U.S. and Canada. Two of them carry passengers only and one carries only rail cars. Four of the ferries operate only on a seasonal basis.

Similar to the pre-clearance facilities at Canadian airports, arrangements exist at major Canadian seaports that handle sealed direct import shipments into the U.S. Along the East Coast, ferry services operate between the province of New Brunswick and the state of Maine, while on the West coast, they operate between British Columbia and the states of Washington and Alaska. There are also several ferry services in the Great Lakes operating between the province of Ontario and the states of Michigan, New York, and Ohio. The ferry between Maine and Nova Scotia ended its operations in 2009, resuming again in 2014.

Seasonal vessel inspection stations are operated at tourist destinations such as Heart Island, New York, and Rockport, Ontario. At landings unmanned by border personnel, telephoning the appropriate border agency may be sufficient to meet legal requirements.

=== Cross-border buildings ===

A line house is a building located so that an international boundary passes through it. Several such buildings exist along the U.S.–Canada border:

* The Haskell Free Library and Opera House straddles the border in Derby Line, Vermont, and Stanstead, Quebec. 
* Private homes divided by the boundary line between Estcourt Station, Maine, and Pohénégamook, Quebec.
* Private homes divided between Beebe Plain, Quebec, and Beebe Plain, Vermont; 
* A seasonal home divided at the intersection of Matthias Lane in Alburgh, Vermont, and Chemin au Bord de l&#x27;Eau in Noyan, Quebec; 
* A house divided between Richford, Vermont, and Abercorn, Quebec. 
* The Halfway House (also known as Taillon&#x27;s International Hotel) is a tavern, built-in 1820 before the border was surveyed, that straddles the border between Dundee, Quebec, and Fort Covington, New York.

The Maine–New Brunswick border divides the Aroostook Valley Country Club.

==Boundary divisions==
=== Practical exclaves ===
To be a true international exclave, &quot;all&quot; potential paths of travel from the exclave to the home country must cross over only the territory of a different country or countries. Like exclaves, practical exclaves are not contiguous with the &quot;land&quot; of the home country and have &quot;land&quot; access only through another country or countries. Unlike exclaves, they are not &quot;entirely&quot; surrounded by foreign territory. Hence, they are exclaves &quot;for practical purposes&quot;, without meeting the strict definition.

The term &quot;pene-exclave,&quot; also known as a &quot;functional&quot; or &quot;practical&quot; exclave, was defined by G. W. S. Robinson (1959) as &quot;parts of the territory of one country that can be approached conveniently — in particular by wheeled traffic — only through the territory of another country.&quot; Thus, a pene-exclave has land borders with other territories but is not surrounded by the other&#x27;s land or territorial waters. Catudal (1974) and Vinokurov (2007) provide examples to further elaborate, including Point Roberts, Washington: &quot;Although physical connections by water with Point Roberts are entirely within the sovereignty of the United States, land access is only possible through Canada.&quot; Practical exclaves can exhibit continuity of state territory across territorial waters but a discontinuity on land, such as in the case of Point Roberts.

==== Practical exclaves of Canada ====

The Quebec western portion of the Akwesasne reserve is a practical exclave of Canada because of the St. Lawrence River to the north, the St. Regis River to the east, New York State, U.S. to the south. To travel by land to elsewhere in Canada, one must drive through New York State.

Campobello Island is another practical exclave located at the entrance to Passamaquoddy Bay, adjacent to the entrance to Cobscook Bay, and within the Bay of Fundy. The island is part of Charlotte County, New Brunswick, but is physically connected by the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Bridge with Lubec, Maine, the easternmost tip of the continental United States.

Premier, British Columbia, is an abandoned mining site accessible only through Hyder, Alaska.

==== Practical exclaves of the United States ====

Alaska is a non-contiguous U.S. state bounded by the Bering Sea; the Arctic and Pacific oceans; and Canada&#x27;s British Columbia and Yukon Territory. Additionally, because of the terrain, several municipalities in southeast Alaska (the &quot;Panhandle&quot;) are inaccessible by road, except via Canada. Specifically, the town of Hyder, Alaska, is accessible only through Stewart, British Columbia, or by floatplane. Moreover, Haines and Skagway are accessible by road only through Canada, although there are car ferries that connect them to other Alaskan places.

Point Roberts, Washington, is bounded by British Columbia, the Strait of Georgia, and Boundary Bay.

In Minnesota, Elm Point, two small pieces of land to its west (Buffalo Bay Point), and the Northwest Angle are bounded by the province of Manitoba and Lake of the Woods.

In Vermont, the Alburgh Tongue, as well as Province Point, which is the small end of a peninsula east of Alburgh, are bounded by Quebec and Lake Champlain.

=== Split features ===
Between Quebec and Vermont, Province Island is a piece of land that primarily lies in Canada, though a small portion of the island is situated in the U.S. state, lying south of the 45th parallel with a border vista marking the international boundary.

Canusa Street in Beebe Plain, Vermont, is the only place where the border lies in the middle of a street.

Between North Dakota and Manitoba, the international border splits a peninsula within a lake on the border of Rolette County, North Dakota, and the Wakopa Wildlife Management Area, MB. Likewise, Lake Metigoshe, lying in the Township of Roland, borders the municipality of Winchester, Manitoba. The border splits a shoreline, putting Canadian cabins on one side and the beach and boat docks for those cabins on the U.S. side, while land access is only through Canada.

=== Remaining boundary disputes ===
* Machias Seal Island and North Rock (Maine / New Brunswick)
* Dixon Entrance (Alaska / British Columbia)
* Beaufort Sea (Alaska / Yukon)
* Strait of Juan de Fuca (Washington / British Columbia)

<text>Interac is a Canadian interbank network that links financial institutions and other enterprises for the purpose of exchanging electronic financial transactions. Interac serves as the Canadian debit card system and the predominant funds transfer network via its e-Transfer service. There are over 59,000 automated teller machines that can be accessed through the Interac network in Canada, and over 450,000 merchant locations accepting Interac debit payments.

==History==

The network was launched in 1984 through the nonprofit Interac Association, a cooperative venture between five financial institutions: RBC, CIBC, Scotiabank, TD, and Desjardins; by 2010, there were over 80 member organizations. The group founded a for-profit counterpart organization, Acxsys, in 1996, which launched additional Interac-branded services including e-transfers. Following several aborted merger attempts which were either blocked by the Competition Bureau or by some of the co-owners between 2008 and 2013, Interac and Acxsys were combined into a single for-profit organization, Interac Corporation, on 1 February 2018. Interac&#x27;s head office is located at Royal Bank Plaza in Toronto.

In 2019, Interac Corporation acquired 2Keys Corporation, Ottawa-based digital identity and cyber security for governments, financial institutions and commercial clients.

In 2021, Interac Corporation acquired the exclusive rights to the digital ID services for Canada from the digital ID and authentication provider SecureKey Technologies Inc.

On July 8, 2022, all Interac services were disrupted in Canada due to a nationwide Rogers Communications network outage resulting in millions of dollars in lost transactions for businesses. On July 11, 2022, Interac stated they were adding another provider in addition to Rogers to strengthen their network redundancy.

==Services==

Interac is the organization responsible for the development of a national network of two shared electronic financial services:

===Interac Direct Payment (IDP)===
Interac Direct Payment (IDP) is Canada&#x27;s national debit card service for purchasing of goods and services. In 1990 Interac launched a new pilot called Interac Direct Payments. Customers enter their personal identification number (PIN) and the amount paid is deducted from either their chequing or savings accounts.
As of 2001, the number of transactions completed via IDP has surpassed those completed using physical money.
Beginning in 2004, IDP purchases could also be made in the United States at merchants on the NYCE network.
IDP is similar in nature to the EFTPOS systems in use in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.

Interac Direct Payment is a PIN-based system where the information entered on the PIN pad is encrypted and verified at a central server, rather than being stored on the card itself. Because of this, it is significantly more secure than traditional signature or card-based transactions. Despite these security features, there are ongoing fraud concerns, particularly when debit cards are &quot;duped&quot; or &quot;skimmed&quot; — a compromised automated teller machine or point-of-sale terminal will record the account information contained in the magnetic strip of the card, allowing for duplicate cards to be created at a later time. The owner of the card is then secretly video taped or observed entering their PIN, allowing a criminal to use duplicate cards to make fraudulent purchases.

====Interac chip cards====
In 2007, Interac announced it would be moving to EMV chip card technology. The main benefit to this technology over the existing magnetic stripes is that the chips are almost impossible to copy due to high levels of encryption.

===Shared Cash Dispensing (SCD)===
Shared Cash Dispensing (SCD): cash withdrawals from any ABM not belonging to a cardholder&#x27;s financial institution. This Canada-specific service is similar to international systems like Plus or Cirrus. Virtually every ABM in Canada is on the Interac system.

===Interac e-Transfer Service===

The Interac e-Transfer service is offered by CertaPay. It allows online banking customers to send money to anyone with an e-mail address or a cellphone number and a bank account in Canada. Prior to February 2018, this was an Interac-branded service operated by Acxsys Corporation. Interac e-Transfer service is designated as a prominent payment system and is subject to oversight by the Bank of Canada.

===Interac Online===
The Interac Online service allows customers to pay for goods and services over the Internet using funds directly from their bank accounts. Because no financial information is shared with the online merchant, the Interac Online service is more secure than online credit card payments. This service, operated by Acxsys Corporation from 2005-2018 and by Interac Corporation since then, was available to customers of four of the five largest Canadian banks: RBC, BMO, Scotiabank, and TD Canada Trust by 2007.

By February 2009, Interac Online was supported by roughly 300 merchants including two large universities (for tuition payments), two major wireless carriers, provincial lottery corporations, and a wide variety of retailers. It was later adopted by Paymentwall (for payments to third-party merchants) and the Canada Revenue Agency (for income tax payments).

Interac Online was an Online Banking ePayments service very similar to iDEAL in the Netherlands, Giropay in Germany, and Secure Vault Payments in the United States.

The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation has dropped all support for Interac Online, effective 6 January 2023. According to their site, &quot;Interac Online is being phased out by major financial institutions and will no longer be supported as a payment option for deposits.&quot;

As of 2023, the service has been dropped by all major Canadian banks except TD Canada Trust and the First Nations Bank of Canada, with RBC being the latest to abandon the scheme. 

A few small credit unions in British Columbia, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland remain.

According to the Royal Bank of Canada, &quot;As of January 6 2023, RBC will no longer support the option to pay for online purchases using the Interac Online Payments service. If you use Interac Online Payment service to make CRA tax payments: You will be able to make tax payments to CRA using Interac Online Payment until May 30, 2023.&quot;

<doc id="630280" wikidata="Q1341699" url="?curid=630280" title="Montreal Shamrocks">
<text>The Montreal Shamrocks were an amateur, later professional, and then amateur again men&#x27;s ice hockey club in existence from 1886 to 1924, based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. They were spun off from the Montreal Shamrocks lacrosse club. Starting off as an independent club and briefly playing in the AHAC, the team became a permanent fixture in the early amateur leagues, when in 1895 they merged with the Montreal Crystals and replaced them midway through the 1895 season in the AHAC. The club eventually went professional and played one season in the National Hockey Association (NHA), the predecessor of today&#x27;s National Hockey League.
Afterwards, with the cost of professionalism being too expensive, the team reverted to an amateur club and played into the 1920s in various amateur leagues.
Their greatest success came when they won back to back Stanley Cups at the turn of the century in 1899 and 1900.

==Team history==

The Shamrocks were founded on December 15, 1886, at a meeting of the Shamrock Lacrosse Club to organize an ice hockey club. The Shamrock Lacrosse Club of Montreal predated the hockey team by twenty years, founded in 1867 by J. B. L. Flynn. Both teams were under the umbrella name of the &quot;Shamrock Amateur Athletic Association&quot; of Montreal. The Shamrocks started off playing exhibition games, but their standard of play increased leading to the club playing in two Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) challenges, in 1891 and 1892 respectively. After these challenges the club went into dormancy, but in 1895 the &quot;SAAA&quot; purchased the Montreal Crystals&#x27; hockey club and merged them into the Shamrocks, reviving the team in the process. The newly revived Montreal Shamrocks hockey club then replaced the Crystals midway through the AHAC&#x27;s 1895 season. After this, the club began actively competing in season based play.

The club rose to be the pre-eminent senior amateur hockey club in North America by the turn of the twentieth century, winning the Stanley Cup in 1899 and 1900 before losing a Stanley Cup challenge in 1901. Following the retirement of its stars, including Hall of Famers Harry Trihey and Arthur Farrell, the Shamrocks faded from prominence and never again had a winning season. They were eventually done in as a professional entity around 1910 by the growth of professionalisation in hockey. Despite playing one season in the National Hockey Association (the forerunner to the National Hockey League), they had trouble competing financially with other clubs, and with the myriad splits and feuding in elite-level hockey (which lead to the formation, disbandment, and formation of new leagues), the Shamrocks ceased being a professional club and became dormant.

In 1911–12, the club was reactivated and returned to their amateur roots by joining the Interprovincial Amateur Hockey Union. In 1912–13, they joined the Montreal City Hockey League. They played in that league until 1924 when the Shamrocks finally folded.

==Junior teams==
Outside of the popular senior team, the Montreal Shamrocks had two lower tier teams. First was an intermediate team that played from 1896 through 1912. From 1896 to 1898 they played in the &quot;Intermediate Amateur Hockey Association of Canada&quot; (IAHAC). Then, from 1899 to 1912, they played in the &quot;Intermediate Canadian Amateur Hockey league&quot; (ICAHL).

There was also a junior team that played from 1902 through 1916. In 1902 they played in the &quot;Junior Montreal Hockey League&quot;. In 1903 they played in the &quot;Independent Junior League&quot;. From 1904 to 1908, they played in the &quot;Junior Amateur Hockey Association of Canada&quot; (JAHAC). The team became dormant in 1909 but returned in 1915. They would fold after the 1916 season.

==Players==
While the lacrosse club was a predominantly working-class team, based largely in the Irish Catholic industrial working-class neighbourhood of Griffintown, the hockey club reflected a more bourgeois background, more in keeping with the image the Shamrock Amateur Athletic Association wished to convey to the wider community of Montreal, as Irish Catholics attempted to integrate into the mainstream of the city&#x27;s body politic in the late 19th century. Many of the players on the Stanley Cup–winning teams of 1899–1901 went on to study at McGill University, and entered into the city&#x27;s bourgeois professional ranks as doctors, lawyers, and businessmen.

Harry Trihey, the captain of the Cup-winning teams, became a prominent Montreal lawyer and, during World War I, was commissioned by the Government of Canada to raise the Irish Canadian Rangers, a venture that ended with Mr. Trihey resigning his commission and returning to Montreal in 1916 after the British High Command reversed its earlier promise to Mr. Trihey to send the Rangers into battle as a unit, deciding instead to plug them into the front line as reinforcements. Mr. Trihey also had problems recruiting in Quebec and Ireland following the GPO Rising in Dublin at Easter 1916.

<doc id="630289" wikidata="Q16981685" url="?curid=630289" title="Talent Identification Program">
<text>The Duke University Talent Identification Program (commonly referred to as &quot;Duke TIP&quot;) was a gifted education program based at Duke University. Founded in 1980 as one of the first pre-collegiate studies programs offered by an American university, the program aimed to identify gifted students in grades four through twelve and provide advanced educational opportunities, as well as social and emotional support. The Duke TIP program permanently ended in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

== History ==
Duke TIP was founded in 1980 by a grant from the Duke Endowment. At the time, the goal of the program was to identify and provide educational opportunities to help the children reach their full educational potential. The program initially focused on seventh graders, and later expanded to grades four through twelve, allowing the program full reach of middle and high school students.

Due to COVID pandemic disruptions, in 2020 and 2021 the programs were unable to run. As a result the TIP Summer Studies program and the Academic Talent Search were permanently cancelled. Beginning in 2022, all pre-college students were directed to Duke&#x27;s Continuing Studies program.

Across its 40 years of operation, the program benefited over 3 million students, with over 100,000 students applying to the program each year.

== Facilities and Partnering Universities ==
Following the program&#x27;s inception in 1980, Duke University added additional programming locations. Within Duke University, students could attend at the main university campus in Durham, North Carolina or at the Duke Marine Laboratory in Beaufort, North Carolina. Programs were also offered at:

* Rice University
* Wake Forest University
* Georgia Tech
* Davidson College
* Trinity University
* Austin College
* Rollins College
* Appalachian State University
* Louisiana State University
* The University of Georgia
* Belmont University
* Agnes Scott College
* Eckerd College
* Meredith College
* Southwestern University
* New College of Florida
* University of Kansas
* Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute

== Programs ==
TIP offered a variety of programs. There were two talent searches—the 4th–6th Grade Talent Search and the 7th Grade Talent Search—that provided above-grade-level testing, enrichment activities, specialized publications, and other benefits.

There were also in-person and online educational programs available, taking place both during and off the school year, including:

* Summer Studies (grades 7–10)
* Field Studies (grades 9–12)
* CRISIS (grades 5–6)
* eStudies (grades 7–11)
* Scholar Weekends (grades 7–11)
* Academic Adventures (grades 4–6)
* eInvestigators (grades 4–6)

== Eligibility ==
In most cases, eligibility for TIP&#x27;s talent searches were determined by grade-level test scores. Students had to score at or above the 95th percentile on national standardized achievement, abilities tests, or state assessments, or 125+ on an IQ test.

Some of TIP&#x27;s educational programs had additional score requirements. Summer Studies and eStudies both required qualifying scores on the SAT or ACT.

<doc id="630291" wikidata="Q7370553" url="?curid=630291" title="Rotman School of Management">
<text>The Joseph L. Rotman School of Management (commonly known as the Rotman School of Management, the Rotman School or just Rotman) is the University of Toronto&#x27;s graduate business school, located in Downtown Toronto. The University of Toronto has been offering undergraduate courses in commerce and management since 1901, but the business school was formally established in 1950 as the Institute of Business Administration. The name was changed to the Faculty of Management Studies in 1972 and subsequently shortened to the Faculty of Management in 1986. The school was renamed in 1997 after Joseph L. Rotman (1935–2015), its principal benefactor.

The school offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral programs in business administration, finance and commerce, including full-time, part-time and executive MBA programs along with a Master of Finance program, a Master of Management Analytics, the Master of Financial Risk Management, a Graduate Diploma in Professional Accounting, and a doctoral program.

Additionally, in collaboration with other schools at the university and abroad, it offers combined or joint MBA degrees with the Faculty of Law (JD/MBA), the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering (Skoll BASc/MBA), the Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy (PharmD/MBA), the Munk School of Global Affairs (MBA/MGA), the Temerty Faculty of Medicine (MD/MBA); and Collaborative Programs in Asia-Pacific Studies and Environmental Studies.

==History==
The programs for which the Rotman School of Management is now responsible had their origins in 1901 when a diploma program in Commerce was inaugurated in the Faculty of Arts. This was transformed into a Bachelor of Arts program in Commerce and Finance in 1909 and into a Bachelor of Commerce program in 1920. These programs had a strong liberal arts emphasis which the BCom program still tries to retain. A Master of Commerce program was started in the Faculty of Arts in 1938 to provide a more professional program.

In 1950 the MCom program was transferred into the newly created Institute of Business Administration with a Director as its head. The degree was changed to Master of Business Administration in 1960 and the institute was renamed the School of Business. It was elevated to the status of a Faculty with a Dean in 1972 and renamed the Faculty of Management Studies. The name was shortened to Faculty of Management in 1986 and was named the Joseph L. Rotman School of Management in 1997 in honour of its principal benefactor. It still, however, retains its status as a Faculty in the University of Toronto.

A Doctor of Philosophy program was begun in 1969 to develop its research orientation and to provide business school faculty for Canadian universities. In 1982 the School assumed responsibility for teaching the Commerce courses within the BCom program and in 1992 the BCom program became a joint program of the Faculty of Arts and Science and of the Rotman School. In 1983 the School began a privately financed Executive MBA program. In 1989 a privately funded MBA in professional accounting was added. In 1996 it was moved to the University of Toronto Mississauga and the degree changed to Master of Management &amp; Professional Accounting. The School also offers a variety of non-degree Executive Development Programs and operates a number of research centres which complement its teaching and research activities.

===Change to Rotman School of Management===
In 1995, the Joseph L. Rotman Centre for Management, funded in part by a $3 million donation made by Joseph Rotman in 1993, was opened and the Faculty of Management shifted its base to its current building after previously moving locations multiple times. The center was later expanded with additions to the upper floors along with a new South Building, with the original building now known as the North Building. The school was renamed as the Joseph L. Rotman School of Management in 1997, in honour of a $15 million donation of its principal benefactor, Joseph Rotman, to be paid out over a period of time ending in 2011.

Rotman&#x27;s donation was particularly controversial, as examined in a 1997 cover story of &quot;The Varsity&quot;. The donor agreement included several clauses that could limit the university and faculty of management&#x27;s academic freedom. The agreement required that &quot;U of T [rank] the faculty of management as one of its &#x27;highest priorities&#x27; for the allocation of university funding, ensuring to its &#x27;best efforts&#x27; that business education receives continuing focus.&quot; Bill Graham, then-president of the University of Toronto Faculty Association, was among the most vocal opponents of the original agreement, noted &quot;the unqualified support for the &#x27;vision,&#x27; and it talked about non-qualified support for and commitment to the values and principles underlying the &#x27;vision&#x27; by the members of the faculty of management, as well as the central administration&quot;. The donation agreement underwent some substantial revisions, but the Rotman Foundation retained the right to &quot;bring in an outside expert from the Association of American Universities to recommend policy changes if it was felt that the school of management was failing to live up to the criteria set out in the agreement&quot;. The school, however, retains its status as a Faculty in the University of Toronto.

In 1998, former management consultant Roger Martin was appointed Dean of the School, and during his tenure he oversaw the changes mandated by the Rotman Foundation. Martin&#x27;s high profile and outspokenness caused some conflict with the other University faculties, notwithstanding, he was credited with &quot;[transforming] what was a small, rather inconsequential regional player in Canada into a world-class institution offering a more differentiated MBA program focused around integrative thinking, self-development and business design&quot;.

In the year 2000, Marcel Desautels, founder, president and CEO of the Canadian Credit Management Foundation helped in creating Marcel Desautels Centre for Integrative Thinking with a $10-million gift. Rotman developed a new model of business education based on integrative thinking in the same year. The Michael Lee-Chin Family Institute for Corporate Citizenship (originally the AIC Institute for Corporate Citizenship) was established at Rotman in 2004 with a $10-million gift from Michael Lee-Chin. The same year, Rotman completed an expansion of its campus. In recent years, the school has received significant funding from private and public quarters.

In 2011, Rotman&#x27;s academic expenditures were $71 million for 1,500 students (the Faculty of Architecture spent $7 million for 400 students), comparable to that of the University of Toronto Scarborough campus. Part of those costs were attributed to the high salaries paid to faculty, as six of the top 10 salaries paid to University of Toronto employees for 2012 went to Rotman professors and administrators, according to the Ontario Ministry of Finance Public Sector Salary Disclosure (&quot;sunshine list&quot;). Roger Martin, the longtime dean of the school, argued that &quot;It&#x27;s extremely expensive to have a good business school. So the salaries are higher; in order to get world-class faculty you have to pay those salaries. Student services are greater&quot;. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; showed that Rotman graduates saw an average salary increase of slightly over 100 percent after finishing their degrees.

Under Roger Martin&#x27;s leadership, Rotman saw dramatic growth in the size of its programs, faculty, facilities and international reputation. New programs launched included the Morning MBA program, Master of Finance program and a Global Executive MBA program. In September 2012, a new building expansion was opened, more than doubling the amount of teaching, research, study, presentation and special event space.

Becoming the Dean of the Rotman School in 2014, Tiff Macklem launched of a number of specialized graduate management programs at the School, in financial risk management, professional accounting, management analytics and healthcare. He championed diversity and inclusion, experiential learning and entrepreneurship initiatives, such as the Creative Destruction Lab.  A prominent expert on sustainable finance, risk management and public policy, he left Rotman to become governor of the Bank of Canada in June 2020.

Susan Christoffersen began a five-year term as Dean on July 1, 2021. A finance professor at Rotman since 2010, she has also served as Vice-Dean, Undergraduate and Specialized Programs from 2015- 2020 and was known as a curriculum innovator. In 2022, she launched Purpose into Action: Academic Plan 2022-2027 followed by an ambitious new fundraising goal of $250 million as part the University of Toronto&#x27;s Defy Gravity campaign.

==Rankings==
In the 2024 QS Global MBA Rankings, Rotman was ranked for business schools 1st in Canada.

In the 2024 &quot;Financial Times&quot; rankings of MBA programs, Rotman ranked 70th in the world. In the 2023 &quot;Financial Times&quot; Executive MBA programs ranking, Rotman ranked 51st globally.

==Campus==
Rotman is located in the heart of the University of Toronto&#x27;s downtown St. George Campus. There are several noteworthy features of the building (completed in 1995) that houses the school:
* The Fleck Atrium is a large area on the main (ground) floor which is often used for special events, receptions, and public lectures. It occupies the central area of the building, with an open-air concept that allows individuals on the 2nd and 3rd floors of the building to observe from above. The vaulted ceiling of the atrium is made from glass, creating a brightness throughout the interior space.
* The Milt Harris Library, formerly known as the Business Information Centre, is a branch of the University of Toronto&#x27;s library system, and supports the students, faculty and staff of the Rotman School and the Rotman Commerce program.
* The BMO Financial Group Financial Research and Trading Lab is a state-of-the-art facility allowing students access to a wide range of financial analysis software packages and data sets. A variety of business competitions are held in the lab throughout the year. In particular the Rotman International Trading Competition (RITC) is an annual trading competition featuring universities from around the world.
* A CAD $4 million expansion of the building, completed in 2005, added about a dozen new faculty/administrative offices and some meeting rooms to each of the 4th and 5th floors of the building.

To accommodate dramatic growth of the program, the school expanded into a new $91.8-million building designed by KPMB Architects which opened in September 2012. The new building, adjacent to and fully integrated with the existing structure, nearly doubles the size of the facilities to provide more space for research and education. The Rotman expansion includes the Desautels Hall, a 400-seat multipurpose space named after lead philanthropist Marcel Desautels. The hall that can be configured in six ways to suit a range of uses from large examinations and guest speaker series to TED talks and alumni events.

<text>Fortitudo Pallacanestro Bologna 103, commonly known as Fortitudo Bologna and currently known as Fortitudo Flats Service Bologna for sponsorship reasons, is a basketball club based in Bologna, Italy and currently plays in the second division.

==History==
Fortitudo has for much of its history played second fiddle in its own city to arch rivals Virtus Bologna, with whom it contests the fierce Bologna Derby. Fortitudo won its first major trophy in 1998, winning the Italian Cup.

Fortitudo made the Italian league finals ten consecutive years (1997–2006). After three straight finals losses, Fortitudo won the Serie A for the first time in 2000. Four consecutive finals losses were followed by Fortitudo&#x27;s second league title in 2005, courtesy of a 3–1 win over Armani Jeans Milano in the finals series when instant replay upheld a Ruben Douglas buzzer beater in Game 4 of the championship series.

In recent years, Fortitudo had been a fixture in the European top-tier Euroleague. Fortitudo&#x27;s first achievement in European competition was a FIBA Korać Cup final against Jugoplastika in 1977 in their maiden participation. It got to the Euroleague Final four in 1999 (losing in the semifinal against city rivals Kinder Bologna and in third place game against Olympiacos) and the semifinal of the Euroleague playoffs in 2001 (again eliminated by rivals Virtus); then the club lost in the Euroleague final in 2004 to Maccabi Tel Aviv by 44 points. The 2006–07 season saw them change coaches three times as they finished thirteenth (out of eighteen), though they still qualified for the 2007–08 ULEB Cup.

Due to economic irregularities, upon Fortitudo&#x27;s relegation from the 2008–09 season, the team was not allowed to participate in the 2009–10 Serie A2, restarting from the Serie A dilettanti. After winning that league, Fortitudo was once again excluded from Serie A2 and the club&#x27;s affiliation to the Italian Federation revoked. As such, Fortitudo was barred from playing in any league, save for youth development leagues.

=== The Rebirth and return to the top flight ===
On 18 June 2013, a group of local entrepreneurs, professionals and fans joined to give life to Fortitudo Pallacanestro Bologna 103, the spiritual successor (with the same fan base such as the Fossa dei Leoni fan group) of the original entity. Starting from the fourth division DNB, Fortitudo climbed to the second division Serie A2 where it played during the 2015–16 season.

After a successful campaign in 2018–19, the club qualified for promotion to Serie A for the first time since its 2009 dissolution. They later qualified to the 2020–21 Basketball Champions League, but they finished last in their group. In the 2021–22 season, they finished in the 15th position to be relegated to Serie A2.

<doc id="630304" wikidata="Q5757597" url="?curid=630304" title="High memory">
<text>High memory is the part of physical memory in a computer which is not directly mapped by the page tables of its operating system kernel. The phrase is also sometimes used as shorthand for the High Memory Area, which is a different concept entirely.

Some operating system kernels, such as Linux, divide their virtual address space into two regions, devoting the larger to user space and the smaller to the kernel. In current 32-bit x86 computers, this commonly (although does not have to, as this is a configurable option) takes the form of a 3GB/1GB split of the 4 GB address space, so kernel virtual addresses start at 0xC0000000 and go to 0xFFFFFFFF. The lower 896 MB, from 0xC0000000 to 0xF7FFFFFF, is directly mapped to the kernel physical address space, and the remaining 128 MB, from 0xF8000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF, is used on demand by the kernel to be mapped to high memory. When in user mode, translations are only effective for the first region, thus protecting the kernel from user programs, but when in kernel mode, translations are effective for both regions, thus giving the kernel an easy way to refer to the buffers of processes—it just uses the process&#x27; own mappings.

However, if the kernel needs to refer to physical memory for which a userspace translation has not already been provided, it has only 1 GB (for example) of virtual memory to use. On computers with a lot of physical memory, this can mean that there exists memory that the kernel cannot refer to directly—this is called high memory. When the kernel wishes to address high memory, it creates a mapping on the fly and destroys the mapping when done, which incurs a performance penalty.

<text>The 2004–05 NHL season would have been the National Hockey League&#x27;s 88th season of play. The entire 1,230-game schedule, that was set to begin in October, was officially canceled on February 16, 2005, due to an unresolved lockout that began on September 16, 2004. The loss of the 2004–05 season&#x27;s games made the NHL the second North American professional sports league to lose an entire postseason of games because of a labor dispute, the first being the 1994–95 MLB strike, which occurred 10 years prior. It was the first time since 1919, when the Spanish flu pandemic canceled the finals, that the Stanley Cup was not awarded. This canceled season was later acknowledged with the words &quot;2004–05 Season Not Played&quot; engraved on the Cup.

According to the International Ice Hockey Federation, 388 NHL players were on teams overseas at some point during the season, spread across 19 European leagues. Many of these players had a contract clause to return to the NHL when the league started up again, even if it was during the current season.

Key rule changes which would dominate after the lockout were established as a result of a meeting between the NHL and its top minor league, the American Hockey League. On July 5, 2004, the AHL announced publicly the 2004–05 rule changes, many of which were passed as a result of the NHL&#x27;s recommendation for experimentation.
==Entry draft==
The 2004 NHL Entry Draft, the last NHL event to take place before the lockout, was held on June 26 and 27, 2004 at the RBC Center in Raleigh, North Carolina. Alexander Ovechkin was selected first overall by the Washington Capitals.

==Lockout==
On September 16, 2004, the NHL initiated a lockout of the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) after the existing NHL collective bargaining agreement (CBA) expired one day earlier. The action marked the third labour dispute between the league and the NHLPA in twelve years, following the 1992 strike and the 1994–95 lockout. The league attempted to convince the players to accept a salary cap to limit expenditure on player salaries, linking the cap to league revenues and thus guaranteeing the clubs what the league called &quot;cost certainty&quot;. According to an NHL-commissioned report prepared by former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Arthur Levitt, prior to 2004–05, NHL clubs spent about 76 percent of their gross revenues on players&#x27; salaries – a figure far higher than those in other North American sports – and collectively lost US$273 million during the 2002–03 season. On July 20, 2004, the league presented the NHLPA with six concepts to achieve cost certainty. These concepts were believed to have included a &quot;hard&quot;, or inflexible, salary cap similar to the one used in the National Football League, a &quot;soft&quot; salary cap with some capped exceptions similar to the one used in the National Basketball Association, and a centralized salary negotiation system similar to that used in the Arena Football League and Major League Soccer.

The NHLPA, under executive director Bob Goodenow, however disputed the league&#x27;s financial claims and rejected each of the NHL&#x27;s proposed six concepts. The NHLPA preferred to retain the existing &quot;marketplace&quot; system where players individually negotiate contracts with teams, and teams have complete control of how much they want to spend on players. Goodenow&#x27;s mistrust of the league was supported by a November 2004 &quot;Forbes&quot; report that estimated the NHL&#x27;s losses were less than half the amounts claimed by the league. Although the NHL&#x27;s numbers regarding financial losses were disputed, there was no question that several franchises were losing money: some had already declared bankruptcy, and others had held &quot;fire sales&quot; of franchise players, such as the Washington Capitals. Some small-market teams, such as the Pittsburgh Penguins and the remaining small-market Canadian teams, were actually hoping &quot;for&quot; a lockout, since those teams would make more money by losing a season.

During the lockout, further attempts to negotiate a new CBA floundered. By February 14, the union made an offer to accept a $52 million salary cap under the condition that it was not linked to league revenues, to which the league proposed a counteroffer of a $40 million cap plus $2.2 million in benefits, which the players association rejected. The next day, Bettman sent Goodenow a letter with a final proposal of a $42.5 million cap plus $2.2 million in benefits, setting a deadline of 11:00 the next morning to accept or refuse the offer. The NHLPA presented a counter-offer involving a $49 million cap, which the league rejected. With no resolution by the 11:00 deadline, NHL commission Gary Bettman announced the cancellation of the 2004–05 season on February 16, 2005, making the NHL the first major professional sports league in North America to cancel an entire season because of a labor dispute; the announcement was to have come on February 14, but it was delayed because of the death of the patriarch of the Sutter hockey family four days prior, whose funeral was held on February 15.

With the prospect of losing a second season, a deal was eventually reached on July 13. The salary cap would be adjusted each year to guarantee players 54 percent of total NHL revenues, and there would also be a salary floor. Player contracts are also guaranteed. The players&#x27; share will increase if revenues rise to specific benchmarks, while revenue sharing will split a pool of money from the 10 highest-grossing teams among the bottom 15. There was a $39 million cap in place for the first year of the CBA.

==Canceled All-Star Game==
The 2005 All-Star Game was originally scheduled to take place on February 13 at Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia, the home arena of the Atlanta Thrashers. With negotiations between the NHL and the NHLPA stalled, the league announced the game&#x27;s cancellation on November 3. Atlanta would later host the 2008 All-Star Game.

==Stanley Cup controversy==
As a result of the lockout, no Stanley Cup champion was crowned for the first time since the Spanish flu pandemic in 1919. This was controversial among many fans, who questioned whether the NHL had exclusive control over the Cup. A website known as freestanley.com (since closed) was launched, asking fans to write to the Cup trustees and urge them to return to the original pre-NHL Challenge Cup format. Adrienne Clarkson, then Governor General of Canada, alternately proposed that the Cup be presented to the top women&#x27;s hockey team in lieu of the NHL season, but this idea was so unpopular with NHL fans, players, and officials that the Clarkson Cup was created instead. Meanwhile, a group in Ontario, also known as the &quot;Wednesday Nighters&quot;, filed an application with the Ontario Superior Court, claiming that the Cup trustees had overstepped their bounds in signing the 1947 agreement with the NHL, and therefore must award the trophy to any team willing to play for the cup regardless of the lockout.

On February 7, 2006, a settlement was reached in which the trophy could be awarded to non-NHL teams in the event the league does not operate for a season, but the dispute lasted so long that, by the time it was settled, the NHL had resumed operating for the 2005–06 season, and the Stanley Cup went unclaimed for the 2004–05 season.

==Broadcasting rights==
Before the lockout, the NHL had reached two separate deals with NBC (who would replace ABC as the NHL&#x27;s American national broadcast television partner) and ESPN. ESPN offered to televise 40 games (only fifteen of which would be during the regular season), all on ESPN2, with presumably, only some midweek playoff games, the first two games of the Stanley Cup Finals and the All-Star Game airing on ESPN. NBC&#x27;s deal involved a revenue sharing agreement with the NHL as opposed to a traditional rights fee, and included rights to six regular season windows, seven postseason broadcasts and games 3–7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. ESPN had a two-year deal that they opted out of after the lockout, leaving the NHL without a U.S. cable partner.

During the lockout, CBC replaced &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; with a block of Saturday night movies branded as &quot;Movie Night in Canada&quot;, hosted by Ron MacLean from various junior hockey venues. TSN had other sports programming to fill their time slots.

<doc id="630309" wikidata="Q36264" url="?curid=630309" title="Virtus Bologna">
<text>Virtus Pallacanestro Bologna, known for sponsorship reasons as Virtus Segafredo Bologna, is an Italian professional basketball club based in Bologna, Emilia-Romagna.

The club was founded in 1929, which makes it the oldest club in Italy and one of the oldest in Europe. Virtus is the second most titled basketball club in Italy after Olimpia Milano, having won 16 Italian national championships, 8 Italian National Cups and 4 Italian Supercups. Moreover, it is one of the most successful teams in European competitions, having won two EuroLeagues, one EuroCup, one FIBA Saporta Cup, one EuroChallenge and one Basketball Champions League. It currently plays in the Italian first division LBA as well as in the EuroLeague. The club is owned by the coffee entrepreneur Massimo Zanetti.

Some of the club&#x27;s star players over the years have included: Gianni Bertolotti, Tom McMillen, Carlo Caglieris, Renato Villalta, Marco Bonamico, Jim McMillian, Krešimir Ćosić, Roberto Brunamonti, Augusto Binelli, Micheal Ray Richardson, Jure Zdovc, Predrag Danilović, Cliff Levingston, Arijan Komazec, Orlando Woolridge, Zoran Savić, Bane Prelević, Alessandro Abbio, Radoslav Nesterović, Antoine Rigaudeau, Alessandro Frosini, Hugo Sconochini, Marko Jarić, Manu Ginóbili, Matjaž Smodiš, David Andersen, Travis Best, Keith Langford, Miloš Teodosić, Marco Belinelli, Daniel Hackett and Tornike Shengelia. While some of the club&#x27;s greatest coaches have been: Vittorio Tracuzzi, Dan Peterson, Terry Driscoll, Alberto Bucci, Ettore Messina, Aleksandar Đorđević and Sergio Scariolo.

==History==
===1929–1956: Beginnings and post-war dynasty===
Virtus was founded in 1871 as a gymnastics club, forming its first professional basketball team in 1929 as part of a multi sports club. The club&#x27;s motto was &quot;Forte Franco Fermo Fiero&quot; (&quot;Strong Frank Firm Proud&quot;) and was inserted in the logo under the Black V, with a cross made by four F; the motto is still used by Virtus today. The team&#x27;s home court was the former church of Santa Lucia in the city center, which could host a few hundred people.
The first official championship of Virtus dates back to 1929. From 1929 to 1934, Virtus played in the first and second divisions within Emilia region. In 1934, the Bolognese team won the division tournament, obtaining the promotion in the top tournament after a hard-fought group of playoffs against Unione Sportiva of Milan and Ginnastica Rome. Team&#x27;s captain was Venzo Vannini, while other important players were Giuseppe Palmieri and Giancarlo Marinelli. After the promotion, Virtus settled permanently at the top of the national basketball league, and achieved a long series of honorable placings: in the nine championships disputed from 1935 to the outbreak of the Second World War, the Black V collected 6-second places, 2 third places, and a sixth place, however Virtus never achieved to win a national title.

From 1943 to 1945, the championship was suspended due to the outbreak of the war in the country and the beginning of the civil war. At the end of the world war, Santa Lucia was no longer available for basketball games and after a brief period of outdoor matches on a field in Via del Ravone, the team moved to Sala Borsa, the city&#x27;s stock exchange, readjusted in the evening for basketball matches. This unusual venue became the hallmark of a new Italian basketball season, compared to the worldwide famous Boston Garden. In July 1945, Virtus, led by Achille Canna, Luigi Rapini and Antonio Calebotta, won its first national Serie A title, defeating 35–31 Reyer Venezia in the final.
In the following season, Renzo Poluzzi became the new head coach and led Virtus to its second championship. Under Poluzzi, Virtus won the title again in 1948 and 1949, achieving the so-called &quot;four-peat&quot;. In 1949–50 season, the Black V arrived second after Olimpia Milano; during these years, the long-time rivalry with Olimpia, known as &quot;derby of Italy&quot;, began. Olimpia won the title for the next four years too, while the Black V placed second in 1952 and 1953. In 1954, Vittorio Tracuzzi was appointed new head coach; Tracuzzi was a Virtus player too, acting as a &quot;player-coach&quot;. At the end of the season, Tracuzzi led Virtus to its fifth national title. The team doubled the next season, achieving a so-called &quot;back-to-back&quot;. During the 1950s the first derbies were played against Gira and Moto Morini, the other two teams of Bologna.

Due to the increasing fame of Virtus, the Sala Borsa was no longer suitable for hosting games; so in 1956, the long-time Mayor of Bologna, Giuseppe Dozza, inaugurated a new arena, which was simply known as &quot;Sports Hall&quot; and had a seating capacity of more than 7,000 people. The arena was later nicknamed &quot;Il Madison&quot;, after New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden and, in 1966, after Dozza&#x27;s retirement from politics, it was renamed &quot;PalaDozza&quot;. From 1956 to 1960, Virtus placed second, always behind its arch-rival Olimpia Milan. At the end of the 1959–60 season, Tracuzzi left Virtus after having won two championships in five seasons, with a winning record of 108–22, being widely considered one of Black V&#x27;s greatest coaches of all time.

===1960–1968: Post-dynasty struggles===
In 1960, the Spanish coach, Eduardo Kucharski, succeeded Tracuzzi at the head of the team. Virtus, led by its best player Gianfranco Lombardi, took part in its first European Champions Cup, but it was ousted by CCA Bucarest in the second round. At the end of the Italian regular season, the Black V placed second again, behind Ignis Varese.

In 1962 and 1963 Virtus arrived third and Kucharski was sacked, while Mario Alesini, a former Virtus player, became the new head coach. However, in the next three seasons, Alesini did not reach to bring back the title to Bologna. In 1966, Jaroslav Šíp was hired as new head coach, but Virtus never became a real contender for the championship, with Olimpia and Ignis which alternatively won the title until 1968.

===1968–1991: The Porelli era===

The 1960s had been an unfortunate decade for Virtus. The turning point occurred in 1968, when the lawyer Gianluigi Porelli was appointed by the then president of the multi-sport club, Giovanni Elkan, at the head of the basketball section. Alternately nicknamed &quot;Torquemada&quot; or &quot;Robespierre&quot; for his quick and often dictatorial methods, or, more frequently, &quot;L&#x27;Avvocato&quot; (&quot;The Lawyer&quot;), Porelli has been one of the most prominent figures in the history of Virtus which, through initiatives often unpopular but almost always winning, definitively carried towards professionalism.

====1968–1973: Rebuilding====
As soon as he arrived, at only 38 years old, Porelli sacked coach Šíp and appointed Renzo Ranuzzi, a former player. However, Ranuzzi lasted one year only, due to the poor result of the team, which ended the season at the 10th place. After another poor result in the 1969–70 season under coach Nello Paratore, in 1970, Porelli hired Black V&#x27;s legendary coach Vittorio Tracuzzi and sold the best player of the time, Gianfranco Lombardi, unleashing a popular uprising that even ended up in court. Despite Tracuzzi&#x27;s comeback, the team placed 10th once again. In 1970, thanks to Porelli, Virtus was also one of the main proponents and founders of the Lega Basket, the governing body of the top-tier level professional Italian basketball league.

In the same year, Virtus broke away from the multi sports club, becoming a joint-stock company. Thanks to this choice, which was highly criticised at the time, Porelli definitively healed the club&#x27;s finances. In 1971, Porelli hired the American player John Fultz who, supported by important Italian players like Gianni Bertolotti and Luigi Serafini, succeeded in placing the team 5th in the national championship, the best result since 1967–68. In the following season, the team, composed by the same players and coached by Nico Messina, arrived 6th.

====1973–1978: Peterson&#x27;s revolution====
In 1973, Porelli opened a new season of triumphs, thanks to a partnership with Sinudyne, a famous Italian domestic appliances company, and especially with the engagement of the young American coach Dan Peterson, coming from the Chile&#x27;s national basketball team. Virtus immediately won its first Italian Cup in 1973–74 season, which was club&#x27;s first title since 1955–56.
In the following season, Virtus signed Tom McMillen, a 22-years-old player from Maryland University, who was selected with the 9th overall pick by the Buffalo Braves during the 1974 NBA draft. He signed with the Braves but postponed his entry into the NBA to attend the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. McMillen lived and studied in the UK, but he moved to Bologna during the weekends to play basketball. At the end of the season, characterized by outstanding performances by McMillen, the team placed 4th in the national championship and was eliminated at the quarterfinals of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

In 1975, McMillen started his career in the NBA, so Porelli and Peterson signed Terry Driscoll, a former NBA player and 4th overall pick in 1969 draft. Thanks to Driscoll&#x27;s leadership and the fundamental support of Italian players like Carlo Caglieris, Gianni Bertolotti, Marco Bonamico and Luigi Serafini, Virtus won its seventh national championship, the first one after twenty years.

In 1976–77, Virtus ended first in the regular season, however it lost the championship finals against Varese, by 2–0. In the following season, the Black V succeeded in reaching the national finals, but nonetheless it lost 2–1 against Varese again. The team also reached the final of the Cup Winner&#x27;s Cup, but lost 84–82 against Gabetti Cantù.

In 1978, after two consecutive second places, coach Peterson left the Black V to sign with its historic rival, Olimpia Milan. This move was heavily criticised by Black V&#x27;s fans, but it was approved by Porelli himself. However, despite the controversies which rose around his farewell, Peterson&#x27;s legacy was huge: the American coach deeply changed the team&#x27;s organization and contributed in bringing back Virtus to the top of Italian basketball after twenty years of struggles.

====1978–1980: Driscoll&#x27;s back-to-back====

After Peterson&#x27;s departure, Terry Driscoll was appointed new head coach. Porelli signed also Krešimir Ćosić, one of the best centers in Europe; the team was also composed by great Italian players as Renato Villalta, Carlo Caglieris and the captain Gianni Bertolotti. In the national finals, Virtus faced its former coach, Dan Peterson and his new team, Olimpia. Despite the great expectations around a hard-fought final, the Black V easily won the title in only two games. The team also reached the semi-finals of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, where it was eliminated for only one point by the Dutch EBBC.

In the following season, Porelli signed Jim McMillian, a 1972 NBA champion with the Los Angeles Lakers. McMillian, who was immediately nicknamed by Virtus fans as &quot;Il Duca Nero&quot; (&quot;The Black Duke&quot;), led the team achieving a back-to-back, winning its ninth titles against Cantù. The team took part also in the European Champions Cup, where it was eliminated in the semi-finals group stage.

At the end of the season, Driscoll&#x27;s two-year contract had expired. Porelli and Driscoll could not agree on a contract. Despite Driscoll&#x27;s great successes, first as player, one championship, and two championships as a coach in five years, when no agreement was reached, Driscoll chose to return to retire from basketball.

====1980–1988: Champions Cup Final and 10th title====

At the beginning of the 1980–81 season, Driscoll&#x27;s assistant, Ettore Zuccheri, became the new head coach, but he was later replaced by Renzo Ranuzzi. The team reached once again the national finals, but it slightly lost the playoff series by 2–1 against Cantù. Returning to the top in Italy, the Black V attempted to become a major team in Europe too, and in 1981, Virtus reached the final of the FIBA European Champions Cup in Strasbourg. However, a few days before the final, McMillian suffered a serious injury against Brindisi and was forced not to play in the final, which then Virtus lost by only one point against Maccabi Tel Aviv, after a very contested game and dubious referees&#x27; choices.

After the defeat in the Cup, Porelli sacked Ranuzzi and hired coach Aleksandar Nikolić, worldwide known as &quot;The Professor&quot;. The team was composed also by young and talented Italian players like Roberto Brunamonti and Augusto Binelli, as well as important foreign players, like the Bahamian center Elvis Rolle. Despite his fame, Nikolić did not succeed in bringing Virtus back to title, so in 1983, after the brief experiences of George Bisacca and Mauro Di Vincenzo, the 35 years-old Alberto Bucci, from Bologna, became the new head coach. In the same years, the club signed a deal with Granarolo, a milk and dairy production company, which became the new team&#x27;s sponsor. The skilled American small forward Jan van Breda Kolff was also added to the roster. Virtus ended the regular season second, after Peterson&#x27;s Olimpia. The two teams faced themselves in a historic final, always remembered as one of the best in Italian basketball history, in which Virtus defeated Olimpia by 2–1, reaching its 10th national title, also known as &quot;La Stella&quot; (&quot;The Star&quot;), due to the star which is attributed to teams that manage to win ten national championships. In the same year, the team completed a domestic double by adding a National Cup.

In 1984–85, Virtus reached the semi-final group stage of the Champions Cup, where, however, it was eliminated. After a defeat in the playoffs&#x27; quarterfinals against Olimpia, Bucci was sacked and Sandro Gamba became the new coach. Gamba, one of the most successful Italian coaches of all time, did not succeed in winning with Virtus too, exiting in the first round of 1986 playoffs and being eliminated in the quarterfinals of 1987 playoffs. In 1988, Krešimir Ćosić, a former Virtus star, replaced Gamba. Despite the head coach&#x27;s change, the team continued collecting poor successes, being ousted in the Korać Cup&#x27;s quarterfinals and in the first round of national playoffs.

====1988–1991: The &quot;Sugar-mania&quot;====

In 1988, Porelli hired Bob Hill, who was New York Knicks&#x27; head coach until the previous season. Hill brought in Italy two former NBA players: Micheal Ray Richardson, worldwide known as &quot;Sugar&quot;, an NBA All-Star and former player for the Knicks and New Jersey Nets, who was banned from the NBA for violations of league&#x27;s drug policy, and Clemon Johnson, 1983 NBA champion with the Philadelphia 76ers, who also played for the Indiana Pacers and Seattle SuperSonics. At the beginning of the season, Porelli reached an agreement with Knorr, a German food and beverage brand, which became the team&#x27;s sponsor. In 1988–89 Virtus won its third Italian Cup, but it was defeated in the semi-finals for the national championship against Enichem Livorno, coached by Bucci.

Despite the playoffs&#x27; elimination, the season was considered a rebirth for Virtus: the national cup was the team&#x27;s first trophy since 1984 and the great performances of Richardson had brought back the passion for basketball in the city. This period became known as &quot;Sugar-mania&quot;, from Richardson&#x27;s historic nickname.

In the following summer, Hill surprisingly resigned from his post and his assistant, the 30 years-old Ettore Messina, was appointed new head coach. The Black V won the Italian Cup again and on 13 March 1990, won its first European title, the FIBA European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, the second-tier level European-wide competition, defeating 79–74 the Real Madrid coached by George Karl. The final was characterized by an outstanding performance of Richardson, able of scoring 29 points. However, the team was once again eliminated in national playoffs&#x27; quarterfinals against Phonola Caserta.

In 1990–91, Virtus placed third in the regular season but it was once again eliminated in the national semi-finals by Caserta. At the end of the season, Richardson was not confirmed and signed for Slobodna Dalmacija, putting an end to a three-year period in which he brought Virtus to win its first European trophy and laid the foundations for club&#x27;s successes in the following years.

In 1991, after two years of internal struggles within the shareholders&#x27; assembly, during which he also briefly lost the control of the club, Porelli sold Virtus to Alfredo Cazzola, a local trade fair entrepreneur. During 23 years of tenure, Porelli won four national titles, four Italian Cups and one Cup Winner&#x27;s Cup, transforming a simple basketball section of a multisport club into one of the richest and most successful teams in Europe.

=== 1991–2000: The Cazzola era ===
As president, Cazzola brought to Virtus an entrepreneurial mentality, which would be necessary in the team&#x27;s future growth. In the 1991–92 season, the Black V, led by captain Brunamonti and Jure Zdovc, reached the national semi-finals, but lost against Scavolini Pesaro, which had already eliminated Virtus in the national cup few months before. The team also lost against Partizan in the FIBA European League quarterfinals.

====1992–1995: Danilović&#x27;s three-peat====
In the summer of 1992, Cazzola signed Predrag Danilović, a young Yugoslav player who won the latest FIBA European League with Partizan. Under the strong leadership of Danilović and the important support of Brunamonti, Claudio Coldebella, Paolo Moretti, Augusto Binelli and Bill Wennington, the team, coached by Ettore Messina, won its eleventh national championship, defeating 3–0 the Benetton Treviso. However the team was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the FIBA European League by Real Madrid Teka.

In the following season, Messina became the new coach of Italy&#x27;s national basketball team and Alberto Bucci, returned to coach Virtus, with whom he had won a national championship in 1984. The team was completed with Cliff Levingston, two-time NBA champion with the Chicago Bulls. In the same year, Cazzola signed a deal with Buckler Beer, a brand of Heineken, which became the new sponsor of the team. In October 1993, Virtus took part to the McDonald&#x27;s Open in Munich, where it arrived second, after the Phoenix Suns. In May 1994, Virtus won its second consecutive national title, defeating 3–2 Scavolini Pesaro, after a very contested final. Once again, the Black V was ousted during the FIBA European League quarterfinals by Olympiacos.

In the 1994–95 season, Joe Binion replaced Levingston, while the rest of the team remained untouched. In May 1995, Virtus won its 13th title, defeating 3–0 Benetton Treviso, accomplishing a so-called &quot;three-peat&quot;. However, for the third consecutive times, the team which dominated the Italian league was eliminated at the FIBA European League quarterfinals, this time by Panathinaikos.

====1995–1997: Transition years and Brunamonti&#x27;s retirement====
After the three-peat, Danilović left Virtus for the Miami Heat. Cazzola signed Arijan Komazec, a Croatian guard-forward, and Orlando Woolridge, a long-time NBA player; while young Italian players like Alessandro Abbio became increasingly important. In September 1995, Virtus won its first Italian Supercup against Benetton Treviso; while in October, the Black V participated in the McDonald&#x27;s Championship, arriving second after the Houston Rockets. The team ended the regular season in first place, but he was eventually eliminated by Stefanel Milano in the playoffs&#x27; semi-finals. Moreover, the team did not succeed in passing the second group stage of the Champions Cup.

In 1996, captain Roberto Brunamonti retired from basketball after 14 seasons as a Virtus player. During the summer, the club signed important international players like Zoran Savić from Real Madrid Teka and Branislav Prelević from PAOK. Moreover, Kinder, a product brand line of Italian confectionery multinational Ferrero SpA, became the new sponsor of Virtus. On 8 March 1997, coach Bucci was replaced by Lino Frattin, who after a few days, won Black V&#x27;s fifth Italian Cup against Cantù. The team was eliminated by Stefanel Milano in the Top 16 of the FIBA EuroLeague, the former Champions Cup. In the national playoffs, Virtus was eliminated in the semi-finals by the other Bologna&#x27;s team, Teamsystem, which, after years of poor results, was becoming increasingly competitive.

====1997–2000: Danilović&#x27;s comeback and the first EuroLeague====
In 1997, Roberto Brunamonti became team&#x27;s general manager, while coach Messina and Sasha Danilović returned to Virtus and the team was completed with important international players like Radoslav Nesterovič, Antoine Rigaudeau, Hugo Sconochini and Alessandro Frosini, as well as with the confirmation of Zoran Savić and Alessandro Abbio. In the same year, the club moved to PalaMalaguti, an indoor sporting arena in Casalecchio di Reno with a seating capacity of more than 8,000 people, leaving PalaDozza after almost 40 years.

On 23 April 1998, Virtus won its first EuroLeague, defeating 58–44 AEK in Barcelona, with Savić elected MVP of the Final Four. While on 31 May, Virtus conquered its 14th national title, defeating in Game 5 of the final, Teamsystem Bologna. At twenty seconds from the end of the game, with Fortitudo leading by 4, Danilović scored a three-point shot and at the same time suffered a foul by Dominique Wilkins, completing the so-called &quot;four-point shot&quot;. Then Virtus won the match in the overtime. The 1998 final between Virtus and Fortiudo is widely considered as the greatest one in the history of Italian basketball, with two teams from the same city, which were among the best ones in the continent. During this period, Bologna was nicknamed &quot;Basket City&quot;, due to the fame and the victories of town&#x27;s two teams.

In the following season, Virtus won its 7th Italian Cup in January 1999. The team also defeated Fortitudo 57–62 in a historic EuroLeague&#x27;s semi-final in Munich, but it lost 82–74 in the final against Žalgiris of Tyus Edney and was eliminated in the semi-finals for the national championship by Treviso. In 1999–2000 season, the Black V lost the Italian Cup final against Treviso and was defeated 83–76 by AEK, in the FIBA Saporta Cup&#x27;s final in Lausanne. Moreover, Virtus was once again eliminated by Treviso, in the semi-finals for the national championship.

In May 2000, Cazzola sold Virtus to Marco Madrigali, a video game entrepreneur, who became the new president of the club. Under Cazzola&#x27;s presidency, Virtus lived a period which became known as its &quot;Golden Age&quot;, in which the Black V won four national titles, two Italian Cups and a EuroLeague, becoming one of the most notable and successful teams in Europe.

===2000–2003: The Madrigali era===
====2000–2002: Ginóbili&#x27;s rise and the second EuroLeague====
In the 2000–01 season, Madrigali and Brunamonti signed important players, like Marko Jarić, Manu Ginóbili, Matjaž Smodiš, Rashard Griffith and David Andersen; while at the beginning of the season, Sasha Danilović suddenly announced his retirement from basketball. The absence of a strong leader like Danilović and the subsequent ban for doping of another historic player like Hugo Sconochini, forced every single player of the team to take more responsibility, but at the same time opened spaces to the immature and talented newcomers, free to show their abilities and experience at a high level.

After a tough beginning, the season had a turning point during the Christmas derby against Fortitudo, which was soundly won by the Black V by 99–62. From then, Virtus started an outstanding season, characterized by an unrepeatable group capable of beating every record and becoming one of the strongest European teams of all time and, according to many, the strongest ever. On 28 April 2001, Virtus won its seventh Italian Cup against Pesaro, while on 10 May, the Black V won its second EuroLeague, defeating 3–2 Tau Cerámica, in the first and only series in the history of EuroLeague finals. Manu Ginóbili was elected Finals MVP. On 19 June, Virtus won its 15th national championship, beating Paf Wennington Bologna 3–0, while Ginobili was elected Italian League MVP too. After the double in 1997–98, in 2000–01 season, Virtus completed a so-called Triple Crown (known in Italy as &quot;Grande Slam&quot;), winning all the trophies that it could won.

In the following season, Virtus won its 8th Italian Cup, but after some defeats Madrigali fired Messina. However, after a field invasion by Virtus supporters before a match against Pallacanestro Trieste, Madrigali was forced to re-hire him. Despite this, the team lost 89–83 the EuroLeague final, which was held in PalaMalaguti, against Panathinaikos of Dejan Bodiroga and Željko Obradović, and was eliminated in the semi-finals for the national championship by Benetton Treviso.

====2002–2003: Financial problems and interdiction====
In 2003, Ginóbili moved to the NBA, where he played for the San Antonio Spurs, and Ettore Messina was hired by Benetton, thus Bogdan Tanjević was appointed new head coach. During the summer, due to contrasts with Madrigali, Brunamonti also left the club, after nearly 20 years spent as player and general manager.

After a soundly defeat in Fabriano, Tanjević was replaced by Valerio Bianchini, who failed in reaching the playoffs for the first time in Virtus history but succeeded in saving the team from relegation. However, suffering from serious financial problems, mainly caused by the failure of Madrigali&#x27;s video game company CTO SpA, Virtus was excluded from the Serie A in August 2003, after missing payments to players, first of all the young Slovenian Sani Bečirovič.

===2003–2013: The Sabatini era===
The bankruptcy was avoided thanks to the intervention of a local trade fair entrepreneur, Claudio Sabatini, who transacted all the debts of the club, after agreements with creditors and took over the company from Madrigali. Sabatini acquired also the club Progresso Castelmaggiore, from a small town in Bologna&#x27;s hinterland, which played in Serie A2 and sponsored the new team with FuturVirtus brand, guaranteeing, therefore, the continuity of the glorious name &quot;Virtus&quot; despite the exclusion from the championships.

====2003–2005: Promotion to Serie A====
In 2003–04 season, Sabatini signed important former NBA players like Charles Smith, Vonteego Cummings and Rick Brunson. The team was initially coached by Giampiero Ticchi, who was replaced in November by Alberto Bucci, Black V&#x27;s historic coach. Despite good premises, FuturVirtus did not reach the promotion in Serie A, losing 3–0 in the final series of playoffs from Aurora Jesi.

During the summer of 2004 the club obtained the re-affiliation to the Italian Basketball Federation and the right to use the name &quot;Virtus Pallacanestro&quot; again. The team was completed, among others, with Corey Brewer, A.J. Guyton and Bennett Davison and was coached by Giordano Consolini, who served as Messina&#x27;s assistant for years. On 3 June 2005, Virtus returned to the top division, defeating 3–0 the Premiata Montegranaro.

====2005–2009: National finals and return to Europe====

In the 2005–06 season, Sabatini hired Zare Markovski from Macedonia as new head coach and signed, among others, David Bluthenthal, Dušan Vukčević and Christian Drejer. Despite a good season&#x27;s start the team ended 9th, out of the playoffs.

After the end of the season, Bluthenthal, who was Black V&#x27;s top scorer, went to Fortitudo, while Virtus confirmed Vukčević and Drejer, as well as coach Markovski. Moreover, Sabatini signed Travis Best, a former NBA player for the Indiana Pacers, Brett Blizzard, Guilherme Giovannoni, Vlado Ilievski and Tyrone Grant. The team reached the Italian Cup final, losing against Benetton Treviso and placed second in the regular season, qualifying for the playoffs after a five-year absence. Markovski&#x27;s team reached the championship finals, but it was defeated 3–0 by Montepaschi Siena. The Black V also reached the EuroCup semi-finals, where it was defeated by the Ukrainian team Azovmash Mariupol.

In the following summer, the team was suddenly reshaped and Markovski was fired by Sabatini, whose presidency was characterized by his fickle nature, which led him implementing unexpected and often unpopular choices. The president hired Stefano Pillastrini as new head coach and signed, among others, Alan Anderson, Delonte Holland, Dewarick Spencer and Roberto Chiacig. Virtus participated in the EuroLeague, but arrived last in the Group A, winning only two games out of 14. In January 2008, Pillastrini was fired and Renato Pasquali became the new coach; after few months Sabatini re-signed Travis Best, who led the team to the second consecutive Italian Cup final, lost against Avellino. However, Virtus ended the season at the 16th place.

In 2008–09 season, the team was completely renewed with prominent players like the former NBA player Earl Boykins, Keith Langford, Sharrod Ford and the re-sign of Dušan Vukčević. After few months, coach Pasquali was succeeded by Matteo Boniciolli. On 21 February, Virtus played its third consecutive Italian Cup final, which once again lost against Siena. On 26 April 2009, Virtus won the European third tier trophy, the EuroChallenge, against Cholet Basket, thanks to 21 points of the Final Four MVP Keith Langford. The team ended the regular season at the 5th place and was eliminated in the first round of national playoffs by Treviso. Boniciolli was immediately fired by president Sabatini and the team was reshaped again during summer.

====2009–2013: Transition years====
In the following season, Sabatini hired Lino Lardo as head coach and appointed Vukčević as team&#x27;s captain. He also signed, among others, David Moss, Andre Collins, Petteri Koponen and Viktor Sanikidze. Virtus lost its fourth consecutive Italian Cup final and ended the season 5th, being eliminated 3–2 in the first round of the playoffs by Cantù. In 2010–11, the team was completed with Giuseppe Poeta, Valerio Amoroso, Jared Homan, as well as K.C. Rivers from 2011. The Black V ended the regular season 8th and was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Siena.

In 2011–2012, Sabatini hired Alessandro Finelli as new coach and signed important players like Chris Douglas-Roberts, a former NBA players, Terrell McIntyre and Angelo Gigli. In late 2011, Sabatini sold Virtus to a foundation of local entrepreneurs, however, he remained as CEO and &quot;de facto&quot; general manager. At the end of the regular season, the Black V arrived 5th, being eliminated by Dinamo Sassari, in the first round of the playoffs. In the following season, Virtus signed, among others, Steven Smith, Richard Mason Rocca and Jacob Pullen. During the season, Luca Bechi succeeded Finelli as new head coach. The team ended the season at the 14th place.

===2013–2016: Struggles and relegation===
After years of poor successes, Sabatini definitively exited from the club and in 2013, Renato Villalta, a former Virtus star, was appointed president. In 2013–14 season, Virtus signed, among others, Matt Waksh, Willie Warren and Shawn King. In January 2014, Bechi was sacked due to poor results, and Giorgio Valli became the new coach. However, the team arrived 13th, out of the playoffs.

In 2014–15 season, Virtus returned to the playoffs, thanks to an outstanding season of its top-scorers Allan Ray, Jeremy Hazell and Okaro White. However, it was eliminated in the first round by Olimpia Milan.

In the following year Villalta was abruptly removed from his post and Francesco Bertolini was appointed president by the foundation. After a few months, Bertolini was replaced too by Alberto Bucci, the former Virtus coach, who won three national titles with the Black V between 1980s and 1990s. However, the season was characterized by a serious injury to team captain, Allan Ray, and the substitute players signed by the club failed to adequately replace the injured top-player. On 4 May 2016, at the end of the regular season the team ranked 16th and last, therefore it was relegated to Serie A2 for the first time in its history.

===2016–present: The Zanetti era===
====2016–2019: Promotion and Champions League====

In the following summer, president Bucci announced Alessandro Ramagli as new head coach of Virtus. The club built a good team for the league, led by important players such as Guido Rosselli, Klaudio Ndoja, Michael Umeh and Kenny Lawson. During the season an important change in ownership occurred: the coffee entrepreneur and former politician, Massimo Zanetti, owner of Segafredo, who was also team&#x27;s sponsor, became the majority shareholder of the club. Virtus ended second in the regular season behind Treviso and on 19 June 2017, won the playoffs, beating Trieste by 3–0, thus returning to the top series after only one year. During the playoffs, the Black V returned after more than twenty years to Bologna&#x27;s historic arena, PalaDozza, which became the new official home court in the following season.

In summer 2017, the club signed two of the most prominent Italian players, Pietro Aradori and Alessandro Gentile, as well as two international players like Marcus Slaughter and Oliver Lafayette. Despite good premises, the team was eliminated in the first round of Italian Cup&#x27;s Final Eight and failed to qualify for the championship playoffs.
The 2018–19 season began with the appointment of Alessandro Dalla Salda as new club&#x27;s CEO and the hire of Stefano Sacripanti as new head coach. Aradori and Filippo Baldi Rossi were confirmed and the club signed, among others, Tony Taylor, Kevin Punter, Amath M&#x27;Baye and Brian Qvale, to participate in the Basketball Champions League, which was Virtus&#x27;s first European competition after ten years. The team reached a record of seven wins in the first seven games of the continental competition, which had never been achieved before. In March 2019, the team signed Mario Chalmers, two-time NBA champion with the Miami Heat. On 9 March, president Alberto Bucci died at 70 years old, due to complications from a cancer. On 11 March, after a defeat against Cantù and with Virtus temporarily out of playoffs, the team board sacked Sacripanti and appointed the Serbian Aleksandar Đorđević as new head coach. On 4 April, the Black V defeated Nanterre 92, reaching the BCL Final Four in Antwerp, which won on 5 May defeating Iberostar Tenerife 73–61, thanks to an outstanding game by Kevin Punter, who was able to score 26 points and was nominated Final Four MVP. The BCL was the fifth European title in team&#x27;s history and the first one after ten years.

In July 2019, Virtus opened its women&#x27;s basketball wing, to participate in the Serie A1 championship. In the same month, Giuseppe Sermasi, a local entrepreneur and former vice president, became Virtus new president, holding the vacant post after Bucci&#x27;s death, while Luca Baraldi, a prominent sports executive and a leading manager of Segafredo, was appointed new CEO.

====2019–2023: Teodosić&#x27;s magic, the 16th title and the EuroCup====

On 13 July, Virtus signed a three-year deal with Miloš Teodosić, 2016 EuroLeague champion and former NBA player, who was widely considered one of the best European point guard of all time. In August, the Black V signed Kyle Weems, a small forward from Tofaş, and Stefan Marković, a point guard from BC Khimki who, along with Teodosić, would become the backbone of the team in the following seasons. Among others, the club signed also Vince Hunter, Julian Gamble and Giampaolo Ricci. In the 2019–20 season, Virtus played some home games, including the derby against Fortitudo won 94–62, at the Virtus Segafredo Arena, a temporary indoor arena with a capacity of nearly 10,000 seats, located in the Fiera District.

On 7 April 2020, after more than a month of suspension, the Italian Basketball Federation officially ended the 2019–20 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic that severely hit Italy. Virtus ended the season first, with 18 wins and only 2 defeats, but the title was not assigned. On 5 May, the EuroLeague&#x27;s commissioner Jordi Bertomeu announced the cancellation of the EuroCup season too. Virtus, which had achieved the league&#x27;s playoffs, was confirmed for the following season.

After the early end of the season, the team was largely confirmed for the following championship and, in May and June, the club signed prominent Italian players, like Awudu Abass and Amedeo Tessitori, and homegrown ones, like Amar Alibegović. In September, Virtus hosted the Supercup&#x27;s Final Four at the Segafredo Arena, but it lost against Olimpia Milan 75–68; the Supercup was the first competition since the cancellation of the previous season. In November 2020, Virtus signed a three-year deal with Marco Belinelli, from the San Antonio Spurs. Belinelli, one of the greatest Italian players of all time and 2014 NBA Champion, started his career with Virtus in the early 2000s. The season was also characterized by the emergence of Alessandro Pajola, the young Italian point guard who became one team&#x27;s most important players. In April 2021, despite a winning record of 19–2, Virtus was defeated in the EuroCup&#x27;s semifinals by UNICS Kazan. However, the season ended with a great success. In fact, after having knocked out 3–0 both Basket Treviso in the quarterfinals and New Basket Brindisi in the semifinals, on 11 June Virtus defeated 4–0 its historic rival Olimpia Milano in the national finals, winning its 16th national title and the first one after twenty years. Teodosić was appointed MVP of the finals.
On 15 June, after a few days from the victory, Đorđević was not confirmed as head coach at the end of his two-year contract, due to some tensions with the club&#x27;s ownership occurred during the season. On 18 June, the club hired the new head coach, signing a three-year deal with Sergio Scariolo, from the Toronto Raptors. Moreover, Marković, Hunter, Gamble and Ricci were not renewed, while in July and August 2021 Virtus signed important foreign players like Ekpe Udoh, Kevin Hervey and Mouhammadou Jaiteh, as well as one of the most talented Italian point guards, Nico Mannion, from the Golden State Warriors. On 21 September, the team won its second Supercup, defeating Olimpia Milano 90–84. However, during the same month, Udoh and Abass suffered serious knee injuries and Virtus signed JaKarr Sampson from the Indiana Pacers and Isaïa Cordinier from Nanterre 92 to replace them.

On 28 October 2021, Zanetti was elected president of Virtus, succeeding Giuseppe Sermasi at the head of the club, and became the only shareholder after a €2 million capital increase. In early 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent international sanctions against Russia forced all international players to leave the country. On 3 March, Virtus signed the Italian point guard Daniel Hackett, while on 7 March, the club reached an agreement with the Georgian power forward Tornike Shengelia, both of them from CSKA Moscow.
Despite a tough EuroCup regular season ended at the fourth place, Virtus ousted Lietkabelis, Ulm and Valencia in the first three rounds of the playoffs and, on 11 May 2022, defeated Frutti Extra Bursaspor by 80–67 at the Segafredo Arena, winning its first EuroCup and qualifying for the EuroLeague after 14 years. With 21 points scored, the Serbian point guard Miloš Teodosić was once again appointed MVP of the final. However, despite having ended the regular season at the first place and having ousted 3–0 both Pesaro and Tortona in the first two rounds of playoffs, Virtus was defeated 4–2 in the national finals by Olimpia Milan.

During the following summer, Udoh, Hervey, Sampson, Alibegović and Tessitori left the club, but Virtus confirmed the backbone of the roster, notably including Shengelia, who was renewed until June 2024. Moreover, the club signed prominent foreign players like Jordan Mickey, Gabriel Lundberg, Semi Ojeleye and Ismaël Bako. On 29 September 2022, after having ousted Milano in the semifinals, Virtus won its third Supercup, defeating 72–69 Banco di Sardegna Sassari and achieving a back-to-back, following the 2021 trophy. However, despite good premises Virtus ended the EuroLeague season at the 14th place, thus it did not qualify for the playoffs. Moreover, the team was defeated in the Italian Basketball Cup final by Brescia. In June, after having ousted 3–0 both Brindisi and Tortona, Virtus was defeated 4–3 by Olimpia Milan in the national finals, following a series which was widely regarded among the best in the latest years of Italian basketball.

On 11 July 2023, Miloš Teodosić did not renewed his expired contract with Virtus, amicably parting ways with the Italian club and signing with KK Crvena zvezda, marking the end to four fantastic seasons, which saw the Black V returning to the top of European basketball after decades. With the Serbian star, often nicknamed &quot;Il Mago&quot; () by fans, Virtus won its 16th title in 2021, reached the national finals three times in a row, and also won the EuroCup in 2022 and two Supercups.

====2023–present: Rebuilding====

In the following summer, the roster deeply changed. In addition to Teodosić, players like Weems, Jaiteh, Mannion and Bako left the club, as Virtus signed the Italian power forward Achille Polonara, as well as prominent foreign players like the point guard Jaleen Smith, the small forward Ognjen Dobrić, and the centers Bryant Dunston and Devontae Cacok. Moreover, new developments occurred within the club ownership. On 27 June, Carlo Gherardi, owner of CRIF, a global company specialized in business information and analytics, became the minority shareholder of the club, acquiring a participation of 40%.

On 15 September, just a few weeks before the season start, Scariolo was fired following controversial statements regarding the new roster and the upcoming season, and the club hired Luca Banchi as new head coach. On 24 September, after having ousted Milano in the semifinals, Virtus won its fourth Supercup, and the third in a row, defeating 97–60 Germani Brescia. In December, Smith left the club joining KK Partizan and Cacok suffered a serious injury, that brought the club to sign the Croatian center Ante Žižić from Anadolu Efes and the Latvian guard Rihards Lomažs from Merkezefendi. Despite an impressive first half of the season, Virtus ended the EuroLeague regular season at the 10th place, qualifying only for the play-in, where after having defeated 67–64 Anadolu Efes, it lost against Baskonia 89–77, not qualifying for the playoffs. Moreover, the Black V placed first during the Italian regular season but, after having knocked out Tortona by 3–2 and Reyer Venezia by 3–1, it lost the third consecutive final against Milan by 3–1.

In the following months, despite losing Lundberg, Dunston, Abass and Mickey, the club confirmed the backbone of the roster and added prominent international players like the small forward Will Clyburn, a former EuroLeague champion and Final Four MVP, the point guard Matt Morgan, the shooting guard Rayjon Tucker and the power forward Andrejs Gražulis. In December 2024, Banchi resigned as head coach after a 2–11 start in the EuroLeague, and the club signed Duško Ivanović as his successor. In January 2025, a major change occurred in the club&#x27;s management, when Zanetti removed his long-time associate Luca Baraldi as CEO of Virtus, ending his 6 years-long tenure. Moreover, after a few days on February 1, Virtus signed the shooting guard and former NBA Champion Justin Holiday.

==Arena==
Since its foundation, Virtus Bologna has changed several home arenas. Each of them was more than just a basketball court, rather a real &quot;house&quot; of the Black V, marking, in the period when they were used, a different era of the long club&#x27;s history:

In 2023, the club officially presented the project for a new arena with 10,000 seating capacity in the Fiera District, not far away from the temporary Virtus Segafredo Arena, which will be ready in 2025.

<text>Moses ( ; ) is a sculpture by the Italian High Renaissance artist Michelangelo, housed in the Basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome. Commissioned in 1505 by Pope Julius II for his tomb, it depicts the biblical figure Moses with horns on his head, based on a description in chapter 34 of Exodus in the Vulgate, the Latin translation of the Bible used at that time. Some scholars believe the use of horns may often hold an antisemitic implication, while others hold that it is simply a convention based on the translation error.

Sigmund Freud&#x27;s interpretations of the statue from 1916 are particularly well-known. Some interpretations of the sculpture including Freud note a demotic force, but also as a beautiful figure, with an emotional intensity as God&#x27;s word is revealed. The delicacy of some of the features such as Moses&#x27; flowing hair are seen as a remarkable technical achievement, but Freud argues that Michelangelo goes beyond mere skills to provoke curiosity in the viewer, asking why Moses plays with his hair, and why he is presented with horns and flowing hair.

==Commissioning and history==

Pope Julius II commissioned Michelangelo to build his tomb in 1505 and it was finally completed in 1545; Julius II died in 1513. The initial design by Michelangelo was massive and called for over 40 statues. The statue of Moses would have been placed on a tier about 3.74 meters high (12 ft 3 in), opposite a figure of St. Paul. In the final design, the statue of Moses sits in the center of the bottom tier.

==Description==
Giorgio Vasari in the &quot;Life of Michelangelo&quot; wrote: &quot;Michelangelo finished the Moses in marble, a statue of five , unequaled by any modern or ancient work. Seated in a serious attitude, he rests with one arm on the tablets, and with the other holds his long glossy beard, the hairs, so difficult to render in sculpture, being so soft and downy that it seems as if the iron chisel must have become a brush. The beautiful face, like that of a saint and mighty prince, seems as one regards it to need the veil to cover it, so splendid and shining does it appear, and so well has the artist presented in the marble the divinity with which God had endowed that holy countenance. The draperies fall in graceful folds, the muscles of the arms and bones of the hands are of such beauty and perfection, as are the legs and knees, the feet were adorned with excellent shoes, that Moses may now be called the friend of God more than ever, since God has permitted his body to be prepared for the resurrection before the others by the hand of Michelangelo. The Jews still go every Saturday in troops to visit and adore it as a divine, not a human thing.&quot;

The English translation of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s &quot;The Moses of Michelangelo&quot; also provides a basic description of the sculpture: &quot;The Moses of Michelangelo is represented as seated; his body faces forward, his head with its mighty beard looks to the left, his right foot rests on the ground, and his left leg is raised so that only the toes touch the ground. His right arm links the Tables of the Law with something that looks like a book in the right palm of his hand with a portion of his beard; his left arm lies in his lap.&quot;

Jonathan Jones of the English newspaper, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, provides another description: &quot;Moses&#x27;s right hand protects the stone tablets bearing the Commandments; his left hand, veins throbbing, muscles tense, appears to be holding back from the violent action. When he came down from Mount Sinai, Moses found his people worshipping the Golden Calf – the false idol they had made. His anger defies the prison of stone, the limits of the sculptor&#x27;s art. Few can resist the impression of a real mind, real emotions, in the figure that glares from his marble seat. Today, he glares at the tourists who mob the church of San Pietro in Vincoli, Rome. He outfaces them, just as he outfaced Sigmund Freud, who spent three weeks in 1913 trying to figure out the sculpture&#x27;s emotional effect. Moses&#x27;s vitality has made this work popular since the 16th century; according to Vasari, Rome&#x27;s Jewish population adopted the statue as their own. Its power must have something to do with the rendition of things that should be impossible to depict in stone; most quirkily, the beard – so ropy and smoky, its coils gave fantastic, snaking life. But where others might astonish us with technique, Michelangelo goes beyond this, leading us from formal to intellectual surprise, making us wonder why Moses fondles his beard, why Michelangelo has used this river of hair – in combination with the horns that were a conventional attribute of Moses – to give him an inhuman, demonic aspect.&quot;

==Interpretations==

In his 1914 essay entitled &quot;The Moses of Michelangelo&quot;, Sigmund Freud associates the moment in the biblical narrative when Moses descends from the mountain the first time, carrying the tablets, and finds the Hebrew people worshipping the Golden Calf, as described in Exodus 32. Freud describes Moses in a complex psychological state:
We may now, I believe, permit ourselves to reap the fruits of our endeavors. We have seen how many of those who have felt the influence of this statue has been compelled to interpret it as representing Moses agitated by the spectacle of his people fallen from grace and dancing round an idol. But this interpretation had to be given up, for it made us expect to see him spring up in the next moment, break the Tables and accomplish the work of vengeance. Such a conception, however, would fail to harmonize with the design of making this figure, together with three (or five) more seated figures, a part of the tomb of Julius II. We may now take up again the abandoned interpretation, for the Moses we have reconstructed will neither leap up nor cast the Tables from him. What we see before us is not the inception of violent action but the remains of a movement that has already taken place. In his first transport of fury, Moses desired to act, to spring up and take vengeance and forget the Tables; but he has overcome the temptation, and he will now remain seated and still, in his frozen wrath and his pain mingled with contempt. Nor will he throw away the Tables so that they will break on the stones, for it is on their particular account that he has controlled his anger; it was to preserve them that he kept his passion in check. In giving way to his rage and indignation, he had to neglect the Tables, and the hand which upheld them was withdrawn. They began to slide down and were in danger of being broken. This brought him to himself. He remembered his mission and for its sake renounced an indulgence of his feelings. His hand returned and saved the unsupported Tables before they had fallen to the ground. In this attitude, he remained immobilized, and in this attitude, Michelangelo has portrayed him as the guardian of the tomb. As our eyes travel down it, the figure exhibits three distinct emotional strata. The lines of the face reflect the feelings which have won the ascendancy; the middle of the figure shows the traces of suppressed movement, and the foot still retains the attitude of the projected action. It is as though the controlling influence had proceeded downwards from above. No mention has been made so far of the left arm, and it seems to claim a share in our interpretation. The hand is laid in the lap in a mild gesture and holds as though in a caress the end of the flowing beard. It seems as if it is meant to counteract the violence with which the other hand had misused the beard a few moments ago.
Another view, put forward by Malcolm Macmillan and Peter J. Swales in their essay, &quot;Observations from the Refuse-Heap: Freud, Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Moses&quot;, and Psychoanalysis&quot;, relates the sculpture to the second set of Tables and the events mentioned in Exodus 33 and 34. They note that Moses is holding blank tablets, which God had commanded Moses to make in preparation for the second giving of the Law; they also note that Moses is depicted with &quot;horns&quot; which the biblical texts describe Moses as having only after he returned to the Hebrew people after the second giving of the Law. They argue that the statue depicts the moment when Moses sees God, as described in Exodus 33: &quot;The incident in question is the most significant part of the Old Testament story of the exodus. Moses, full of doubt about his own standing and that of his people, takes the considerable risk of requesting—even demanding—that they are forgiven, that he be granted the Lord&#x27;s grace, and that the Lord resume his place and lead them to the Promised Land. Emboldened by his success, he then risks all by asking that the Lord reveal his glory. Little imagination is required to sense the intense emotion with which such a Moses would have awaited the Lord: Will he come? Will he renew the Covenant? Will he reveal his glory?&quot; They further argue that both Paul and Moses experienced God directly, an idea and pairing that were important to the Florentine Neo-Platonists, a group that the authors view both Michelangelo and Pope Julius II as being akin to. Finally, the authors state the key emotion on Moses&#x27; face is &quot;awe at being face to face with the creator.&quot;

===Tensions between Michelangelo and Julius II===
Some interpretations, including those of Freud, refer to the tensions between Julius II, who commissioned his tomb from Michelangelo, and the artist. Freud claimed that Moses functions as a reproach both to Julius and the artist. Bertman notes that Julius II was frequently bearded, which had been unknown among Popes for a millennium, and that there may be physical similarities between the statue and Julius.

===Shining face interpreted as horns===
Following the iconographic convention common in Latin Christianity, the statue has two horns on its head. The depiction of a horned Moses stems from the description of Moses&#x27; face as &quot;&quot; (&quot;horned&quot;) in the Latin Vulgate translation of the passage found at Exodus chapter 34, specifically verses 29, 30 and 35, in which Moses returns to the people after receiving the commandments for the second time. Some modern scholars contend that medieval theologians believed that Jerome had intended to express a glorification of Moses&#x27; face, by his use of the Latin word for &quot;horned.&quot; and that this understanding that the original Hebrew was difficult and was not likely to mean &quot;horns&quot; persisted into and through the Renaissance.

 Classicist Stephen Bertman argues that Jerome is known himself to hold antisemitic views, and may have made the choice to associate Moses with &quot;horns&quot; consciously for theological reasons, expecting his readers to have in mind the New Testament association of horns with devils, wild beasts and the antichrist. In the Christian art of the Middle Ages depicting Moses with horns, this is sometimes done to depict him in glory, as a prophet and precursor of Jesus, but also in negative contexts, especially about Pauline contrasts between faith and law; the iconography was not clear-cut.
Art historian Ruth Mellinkoff argues that while the horns of Moses in origin were in no way associated with those of the Devil, the horns may nevertheless have developed a negative connotation with the development of anti-Jewish sentiment in the medieval and early modern period. Associations in images between Jews and devils were frequently made, and Jews were sometimes portrayed as having horns. Bertman views the statue itself as being a negative portrayal of Moses, building on these perceptions. The statue is argued by art historian Jennifer Koosed as being the culmination of the horned Moses tradition, mixing animal and human qualities to present the divine.

A book published in 2008 advanced a theory that the &quot;horns&quot; on Michelangelo&#x27;s statue were never meant to be seen and that it is wrong to interpret them as horns: &quot;[The statue] never had horns. The artist had planned &quot;Moses&quot; as a masterpiece not only of sculpture but also of special optical effects worthy of any Hollywood movie. For this reason, the piece had to be elevated and facing straight forward, looking in the direction of the front door of the basilica. The two protrusions on the head would have been invisible to the viewer looking up from the floor below – the only thing that would have been seen was the light reflected off of them.&quot; This interpretation has been contested.

== Casts and reproductions ==
In 1931, , a former Minister of Finance of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, known as &quot;the father of the Yugoslav golden Dinar&quot;, and an avid art collector, petitioned Pope Pius XI to use the lost-wax method to have bronze casts of 21 of Michelangelo&#x27;s original sculptures, including &quot;Moses&quot;, produced. The Pope&#x27;s approval was granted on the condition that Veljković would fashion a suitable space with a climate control system that would ensure the internal temperature would be kept within one degree Celsius throughout the year, thus preventing deformation of the bronze over time. Veljković initiated the construction a modern exhibition pavilion in the courtyard of his family house in Belgrade, the capital of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, resulting in the first private museum in Southeast Europe. He named it &quot;Museo&quot;, though it would later become colloquially known as the &quot;Veljković Pavilion&quot;. The building also featured the first modern HVAC system installed in Southeast Europe.

Once the Pope approved the petition, the Paris foundry Susse Frères was commissioned to produce the casts, and the certificates of authenticity were issued by the Vatican. Unfortunately, Veljković died before the new museum was opened in 1934, but his brother Jovan saw the project through.

&quot;Museo&quot; was opened to the public twice a week. In addition to the cast of &quot;Moses&quot;, the museum exhibited over 250 other art pieces, including casts of four other Michelangelo originals—&quot;Day&quot;, &quot;Night&quot;, &quot;Dying Slave&quot;, and &quot;Rebellious Slave&quot;—a number of paintings by Uroš Predić, Paja Jovanović, Sava Šumanović, Nadežda Petrović, and Marko Murat, a set of caricatures by Beta Vukanović, a cast of Jean-Antoine Houdon&#x27;s &quot;Voltaire&quot;, as well as a number of antique sculptures.

The Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in World War II led to the closure of &quot;Museo&quot;. During the occupation, the Germans did not plunder the collection.

After the war and the Communist takeover of Yugoslavia, the museum and the art pieces were nationalized by the state. The building was first given as an atelier to Moše Pijade, then to the sculptor Sreten Stojanović, and eventually converted to a shoe and leather storage by the Municipality of Savski Venac. All the paintings from the collection, as well as a few statues, went missing during this period. The bronze casts of Michelangelo&#x27;s works were transferred to the Academy of Fine Arts, which later evolved into the Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Arts in Belgrade. They were stored at Toma Rosandić&#x27;s workshop in the Topčider neighborhood. The location would later become the seat of the sculpture department of the Faculty of Fine Arts. Today, the cast of &quot;Moses&quot; is still on display there.

In 1971, a reproduction of the statue was unveiled at Myers Park in Auckland, New Zealand, purchased by the Milne &amp; Choyce department store.

<text>Mamie Van Doren (; born Joan Lucille Olander; February 6, 1931) is an American actress, singer, model, and sex symbol who rose to prominence in the 1950s and 1960s. A blonde bombshell, she is one of the &quot;Three M&#x27;s&quot; along with Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield, who were friends and contemporaries. In 1953, Van Doren, then named Joan Lucille Olander, signed a seven-year contract with Universal, which hoped that she would be their version of Monroe. During her time at Universal, she starred in teen dramas, exploitation films, musical, and comedy films among other genres. She has married five times, and had intimate affairs with many other Hollywood actors. She was one of the leading sex symbols in the 1950s.

Van Doren was born and raised in Rowena, South Dakota, but her parents moved to Sioux City, Iowa and eventually to Los Angeles, California in 1942 before she married Jack Newman. In 1949, at the age of eighteen, she won Miss Palm Springs and Miss Eight Ball. As Miss Eight Ball, she was discovered by film producer Howard Hughes, who put her in the RKO films &quot;His Kind of Woman&quot; (1951), &quot;Two Tickets to Broadway&quot; (1951), and &quot;Jet Pilot&quot; (1957) with minor roles. In 1950, she was dating heavyweight boxer Jack Dempsey in New York City and was engaged with him. However, she left him to go back to Los Angeles. On January 20, 1953, Van Doren signed a contract with Universal, who wanted Van Doren to be Universal&#x27;s equivalent of Marilyn Monroe. While at Universal, Van Doren changed her name to Mamie Van Doren, with the &quot;Van Doren&quot; part coming from Universal telling Van Doren she was more Dutch than Swedish, and the &quot;Mamie&quot; part coming from then-First Lady Mamie Eisenhower.

During her time at Universal, Van Doren starred in movies such as &quot;The Second Greatest Sex&quot; (1955), &quot;Running Wild&quot; (1955) and &quot;The All American&quot; (1953). Outside of Universal, she starred in &quot;Untamed Youth&quot; (1957), &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; (1958), &quot;High School Confidential&quot; (1958), &quot;Born Reckless&quot; (1958), &quot;The Beat Generation&quot; (1959), and &quot;Sex Kittens Go To College&quot; (1960). She starred on television shows such as &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;The Jack Benny Program,&quot; and &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot;. After Universal failed to renew her contract in 1959, Van Doren struggled to find work as a free agent. Van Doren starred in many B movies, such as &quot;Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women&quot; (1968), &quot;The Las Vegas Hillbillys&quot; (1966) with Mansfield, and particularly, 3 &quot;Nuts in Search of a Bolt&quot; (1964) with Tommy Noonan. Van Doren had previously refused Noonan&#x27;s offer to star in &quot;Promises! Promises!&quot; (1963), and was replaced. However, Van Doren starred as Saxie Symbol in &quot;3 Nuts in Search of a Bolt&quot;, which, according to Van Doren, was inspired by the success of &quot;Promises! Promises!&quot; This film challenged the Hays Code, and the same year, she appeared in the June 1964 &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine with nude photos of her on the set of the film.

Van Doren went to Vietnam during the Vietnam War to entertain troops in the 1970s. Partially due to the sudden deaths of Mansfield and Monroe, Van Doren decided to retire from acting. In 1987, Van Doren released her autobiography, &quot;Playing the Field: My Story.&quot; On February 1, 1994, Van Doren received her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1998, Van Doren created her website describing herself as “the first authentic kitten on Cyberspace&quot;. On her website, Van Doren posed nude in photos and videos, told stories, and wrote many updates on her life. Van Doren continued her website until it shut down in the 2010s. In 2022, Van Doren released her most recent book, &quot;China &amp; Me&quot;, and has recently begun writing a third autobiography, &quot;Secrets of the Goddess&quot;.

== Early life ==
Van Doren was born Joan Lucille Olander on February 6, 1931 in Rowena, South Dakota, nine miles out of Sioux Falls. She is the daughter of Warner Carl Olander (1908–1992) and Lucille Harriet Bennett (1912–1995). Olander and Bennett had met at a Swedish Lutherian Church, which had been partially built by them. They married in August 1930. She was named after Joan Crawford, who Van Doren&#x27;s mother was a fan of. She is of three-quarters Swedish descent, and also mixed Irish and German. Van Doren&#x27;s father, Warner Olander, worked at a rock quarry to take care of his family, and was paid $0.35 cents a load, sometimes $7.00. According to Van Doren, the town consisted of a church, school, railroad station, and a connected filling station, grocery store, a grain elevator, and a hardware store owned by her great uncle. Her maternal grandmother was Swedish, born in Gothenburg, Sweden. 

In 1939, Van Doren&#x27;s parents moved to Sioux City, Iowa, since her father got a better job as a mechanic. This led to a young Van Doren moving into her maternal grandparents - the Bennett&#x27;s, 160-acre farm in Rowena. Van Doren later reflected on this, saying in her 1987 autobiography “&quot;Playing the Field,” “&quot;It was the Depression, times were that hard.&quot; She described in her memoir that her grandmother, whom she called &quot;Dah&quot;, was an important household figure, while her grandfather, &quot;Pa&quot;, would take Van Doren into town weekly. She additionally lived with her maternal uncle on the farm. Van Doren also recalls in her autobiography her first experience flying a plane on the ranch. Van Doren would walk a mile and a half to a two room schoolhouse on the ranch, often in different types of weather including snow, rain, and wind.

Van Doren grew up sickly on the ranch. Van Doren recalled having her temperature rise to 106°F (41.1°C). However, she was still brought to school when sick by her grandmother, who wanted only herself on the ranch. She additionally had three operations before the age of seven. She almost died at four from a hemorrhage, and had a bump removed from her face, which caused Van Doren to be bullied in school. This removal left a small scar on Van Doren&#x27;s face.

Van Doren moved to Sioux City, Iowa in 1939 to live with her parents, where she watched movies with actors such as Clark Gable, Carole Lombard, Spencer Tracy, Fred Astaire, Katharine Hepburn, Jean Harlow, Mae West, and Ginger Rogers. Van Doren dreamed to be a movie star at this time. &quot;The other thing the movies seemed to promise was love. In every one of those celluloid fairy tales, the heroine lived happily ever after in the company of the man she loved. How I yearned for that. It was then that I set my heart on becoming a Hollywood star.&quot;

In May of 1942, when Van Doren was 11, she moved to Los Angeles with her family during World War II, only a few miles away from Hollywood. Her family quickly moved to an apartment, as many people were moving to the West Coast for the war effort at the time for jobs such as defense plants. After staying at a boardinghouse, Van Doren and her family moved to an apartment on Raymond Avenue, where Van Doren, a child, had to sneak through a door. Van Doren and her family soon moved to a bigger apartment in Los Angeles.

According to Van Doren, a man exposed himself to her while she was in a car heading to her home. In her 1964 book, “&quot;My Naughty, Naughty Life!&quot;,” she reminisces the event saying, &quot;For weeks – and occasionally even years later – that man returned to me in my sleep, leaving me a neurotic young girl and even upsetting me as a woman. For several months after that experience I found myself hating boys, and looking upon men as animals. But I&#x27;m glad that hatred never lasted.&quot;

After her thirteenth birthday, Van Doren was able to convince the manager of Hollywood Pantages Theatre to make her an usherette, which allowed her to watch popular movies at the time. Van Doren often spent time at a drugstore, inspired by the myth of the discovery of Lana Turner at Schwab&#x27;s Pharmacy. At this point, Van Doren had already dyed her hair platinum blonde.

After being commented on by Nils Thor Grunlund, known by his initials NTG, that she looked similar to Jean Harlow, she was able to be on his Hollywood TV show for a minor role. However, her parents were worried that she would get in trouble and feared that she would go on to be killed like Black Dahlia, who was, as stated by Van Doren, one of their closest friends. Despite that, Van Doren went on Grunlund&#x27;s show, coated in white pancake makeup and brown lipstick. Van Doren stated that Grulund&#x27;s show was a prototype to the modern talk show. While making the show, she was known as Little Joanie, the Flower Girl. Van Doren and her mother became friends with Grunlund. Van Doren also sang with Ted Fio Rito&#x27;s Band.

At the Montecito Hotel in Palm Springs, in the summer of 1949, Van Doren was suggested to be Miss Palm Springs, sponsored by the Montecito Hotel. She won the title, and at the Los Angeles Press Club, she was asked to be the club&#x27;s beauty queen, Miss Eight Ball. The previous year, Marilyn Monroe had been crowned the title Van Doren was crowned the title. Due to this, Van Doren had dropped out of Los Angeles High School, which she had hated.

Van Doren met sportswear and shirt manufacturer Jack Newman around 1949, with Newman being one of her father&#x27;s friends whom she watched boxing matches with. Van Doren and Newman soon got engaged and married. They honeymooned in San Francisco. Van Doren said in her book, “&quot;Playing the Field&quot; ,&quot; “When Jack asked me to marry him, I swiftly agreed. He was my ticket out of my parents&#x27; house and into womanhood. We eloped to Santa Barbara, where I lied about my age to the judge who married us.&quot; She married him in 1950 at the Santa Barbara Town, and she initially enjoyed sexual relations with him. Additionally, Van Doren enjoyed Newman&#x27;s wealthy lifestyle, as Newman had lived in a luxury apartment in Beverly Hills, California. According to Van Doren, Newman quickly got jealous of Van Doren due to her often being glanced at in the outfits Newman purchased for her. However, she divorced him after six months due to his abusive behavior, including a time that Van Doren described in her memoir in which he threatened to throw her off a second-story balcony, which was quickly disbanded by neighbors and a time where Newman shredded Van Doren&#x27;s favorite hat.

== Career ==
=== 1950–1953: Howard Hughes, first films, Jimmy McHugh and stage girl ===
Film producer Howard Hughes discovered Van Doren when she was crowned Miss Palm Springs, and, according to Van Doren, the first question he asked her was, &quot;Are you a virgin?&quot; Van Doren recalls that Howard Hughes was controlling when she dated him. According to an interview in 2005, Hughes took Van Doren to a place on Vermont Street to have a braless photoshoot in a white sweater. Van Doren would often meet Howard Hughes at the Garden of Allah Hotel. Hughes provided Van Doren a four film contract deal for RKO.

In 1950, Hughes provided Van Doren with a bit part in &quot;Jet Pilot&quot; (1957) at RKO Radio Pictures, which was filmed from 1949 to 1950, but released in 1957. The film, which starred John Wayne and Janet Leigh, was her film debut. She recalls that she had a good experience with Janet Leigh, who allowed Van Doren to fly in her jet. Her line of dialogue consisted of one word, &quot;Look!&quot; and she appears uncredited in the film. Van Doren additionally had a small role in &quot;Footlight Varieties&quot; (1951) as the girl in the theater in the final scene of the film. Van Doren had another role, in &quot;Two Tickets to Broadway&quot; (1951). The film starred Tony Martin and Janet Leigh, who previously been in &quot;Jet Pilot&quot; with Van Doren.

Van Doren did a few more bit parts in movies at RKO, including &quot;His Kind of Woman&quot; (1951) starring Robert Mitchum, Jane Russell and Vincent Price. The film was shot on the backlot of the David O. Selznick Studio. About her appearance in this movie, Van Doren said, &quot;If you blinked you would miss me. I looked barely old enough to drive.&quot; She was on the film for three months, and because of the money she earned, bought an MG car. Van Doren also met Gloria Swanson who asked her, &quot;Is that your real color of hair?&quot;

Van Doren was coached by Natasha Lytess, who had also coached Marilyn Monroe. Monroe and Van Doren met several times when Van Doren was being coached by Lytess. However, Van Doren stopped her lessons with Lytess because, &quot;Natasha spent most of our lessons talking, however, and there was very little time left, after her long-winded speeches on the art of acting, to actually perform for her&quot;.

In her memoir, Van Doren recollects her relationship with Charles Fischetti, an American mobster and the cousin of Al Capone, whom she met in Las Vegas. Money was often sent to Van Doren from Chicago by Fischetti. Van Doren planned a trip to Chicago to see Fischetti, but she never got to see him due to his sudden death from a heart attack in 1951.

Danielle Cory, an RKO worker and friend of Van Doren, suggested that Van Doren work on stage for the play &quot;Billion Dollar Baby&quot;, which began her career onstage as a showgirl. The show was held at the Proser Cafe Theatre, near Jack Dempsey&#x27;s restaurant. Cory additionally suggested that Van Doren should audition for Alberto Vargas to be one of the &quot;Vargas Girls&quot; in &quot;Esquire&quot;. Vargas ended up picking Van Doren as one of his models.

In New York City, she met boxer Jack Dempsey at the Jack Dempsey&#x27;s Broadway Restaurant. Dempesy frequented the &quot;Billion Dollar Baby&quot; show, and held a celebration for the cast. Dempsey requested to have a dinner with Van Doren, which they later had at the Stork Club, and had a conversation with Sherman Billingsley, the founder of the Stork Club. As Dempsey was treated as a celebrity, the couple was able to go to many other clubs, such as the Copacabana and the 21 Club. Dempsey eventually got engaged to Van Doren, but Van Doren eventually decided to move back to Hollywood because she thought it would be better for her career. According to Barry Lowe, Van Doren was, &quot;Near penniless, out of work, and frightened for the future&quot; due to &quot;Billion Dollar Baby&quot; not being successful. 

At the request of Sammy Fain, Van Doren met songwriter Jimmy McHugh. McHugh had an interest in Van Doren&#x27;s career, and became her manager. Van Doren has stated that since she was managed by McHugh, who was dating gossip columnist Louella Parsons, that Parsons disliked Van Doren. McHugh told Van Doren that he would put Van Doren into a drama school, and additionally arranged for her to be at Ben Bard&#x27;s Theater. Bard had an acting school, and plays that were attended by film scouts, casting agents, and directors. Van Doren was in Bard&#x27;s theater productions, such as &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;, and &quot;At War with the Army&quot;. At Bard&#x27;s school, Van Doren was given advice by Carolyn Jones, and she was taught by Aaron Spelling in private, which broke Bard&#x27;s school rules. Van Doren would also go to many of McHugh&#x27;s parties, attended by Darryl F. Zanuck, Louis B. Mayer, and Buddy Adler. This allowed Van Doren to do a screen test for Paramount Pictures.As stated by Van Doren in her autobiography, &quot;Playing the Field&quot;, Van Doren decided to do a scene from &quot;The Big Knife&quot; for her Paramount screen test. Van Doren later stated that during the audition, &quot;I played the scene with as much intensity as I had ever played a role, feeling the character&#x27;s pain and anguish so acutely that it became my own.” After the audition, according to Van Doren, McHugh told her, &quot;They&#x27;re going to offer you a contract&quot;. However, Paramount made the decision to not sign Van Doren a few days later. Van Doren stated Paramount told her the reason was that she looked too similar to Marilyn Monroe. However, Van Doren believes that the reason she was not signed was because Parsons pressured Paramount into not signing her.

=== 1953–1960: Films at Universal Studios, Paramount, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ===
Van Doren performed in the Bliss-Hayden Theater. McHugh had called the Harry Hayden, manager of the theater, and made time for Van Doren to perform. While performing, Van Doren caught the attention of Phil Benjamin, a Universal casting director, who was in the audience. Benjamin called McHugh, and Van Doren met Benjamin at Universal&#x27;s studio. Benjamin believed that Van Doren was fit for a singer in the then upcoming Universal film &quot;Forbidden&quot; (1953), starring Tony Curtis. Van Doren met the director of &quot;Forbidden&quot;, Rudolph Maté, and requested that Van Doren would sing I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything but Love, Baby, one of McHugh&#x27;s songs. Maté approved, and Van Doren filmed the scene shortly after, where she acted as a singer. During the filming, Van Doren recalled seeing Milton Rackmil, the head of Decca Records. 

On January 20, 1953, Van Doren signed a seven year contract with Universal. Van Doren, whose signing day coincided with the Inauguration of Dwight D. Eisenhower, was given the first name &quot;Mamie&quot; after Eisenhower&#x27;s wife, Mamie Eisenhower. She was given the last name &quot;Van Doren&quot; after Van Doren was told by the studio that she looked more Dutch than Swedish. Universal had intended for Van Doren to be their &quot;answer to Marilyn Monroe.&quot; However, unlike other Marilyn Monroe lookalikes, Van Doren did not portray the &quot;dumb blonde&quot; role in films.

In January 1953, Van Doren took college courses from professors at University of California while training to be an actress at Universal. She also took lessons for horseback riding, diction, scene study, ballet. On February 26, 1953, Van Doren went on a date with Rock Hudson, arranged by Universal, for the 10th Golden Globe Awards. According to Van Doren herself, she had an encounter with Joan Crawford, who &quot;drunkenly tried to flirt with Rock [Hudson].&quot; Midway through the event, Van Doren had a conversation with Monroe while doing her lipstick. In her autobiography, Van Doren describes engaging in sexual activity with Hudson at her parents house after the event had ended.

Van Doren&#x27;s first major role was in &quot;The All American&quot; (1953), a college football film directed by Jesse Hibbs. The film centers around a college quarterback, whose life takes a turn after his parents die in a car accident. Van Doren later said that Hibbs encouraged her to fondle him, and often put her hand at his groin during rehearsals. The film also starred Tony Curtis, Lori Nelson, and Richard Long. In &quot;The All American&quot;, Van Doren played Susie Ward, an ambitious waitress initially looking to find a wealthy spouse near a university. Susie Ward is a sultry, flirtatious and manipulative person, who tricks an inebriated person into proposing to her. Due to good reviews from Universal-International executives, Van Doren was sent on tour to promote the film. 

Van Doren&#x27;s second major film was the 1954 film &quot;Yankee Pasha&quot;. The film was based on Edison Marshall&#x27;s 1947 novel of the same name, which Universal had recently purchased. &quot;Yankee Pasha&quot; centers around a man who sails the ocean, played by Jeff Chandler, to find his true love, a woman forced into slavery, who was portrayed by Van Doren. The eight week shooting schedule exhausted Van Doren, resulting in weight loss. Van Doren has said that she was attracted to Joseph Pevney, director of &quot;Yankee Pasha&quot;. She had a relationship with him, and Van Doren said that she would embrace Pevney in his office.
In &quot;Playing the Field&quot;, Van Doren claimed that she auditioned for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, hoping to get the role of Ado Annie in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, a movie based on the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. Despite Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II liking her audition, she was denied the role which was given to Gloria Grahame instead.

Van Doren starred in the 1954 film &quot;Francis Joins the WACS&quot;, playing the role of Corporal Bunky Hilstrom. Universal also let Van Doren go to the 1954 premiere of &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; with Conrad &quot;Nicky&quot; Hilton Jr., son of Conrad Hilton. Van Doren later entered into a relationship with him. Van Doren has recounted that Conrad Hilton disapproved of her being in a relationship with Nicky Hilton. Van Doren almost ended her romantic relationship with Hilton due to his behavior on a double-date with her friend.

Van Doren completely ended her relationship with Hilton while shooting Edward Buzzell&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot; (1955), with Van Doren starring as &quot;Jackie&quot;. In &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&quot;&#x27;, Van Doren was cast as a dumb blonde. Van Doren was getting annoyed that she kept getting similar roles. On the set, she met Prince Axel of Denmark. Prince Axel would be in contact with Van Doren, and would invite her to several events. However, Van Doren was in a relationship with bandleader Ray Anthony. 

At the time that Van Doren and Anthony started their relationship, Anthony was in the process of being filmed for &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot; (1955). After he finished filming, he went on a vacation to Hawaii with Van Doren. On the short vacation, Van Doren and Anthony often embraced each other while photographers followed the two. The trip allowed Van Doren to spend time with Anthony. However, the trip ended because Anthony had to attend the premiere of &quot;Daddy Long Legs.&quot;

Van Doren began working on &quot;The Second Greatest Sex&quot;, a 1955 film directed by George Marshall, in May of 1955. The film co-stars Jeanne Crain and George Nader. 

Van Doren appeared opposite an uncredited and unknown Clint Eastwood in &quot;Star in the Dust&quot;. Though Van Doren garnered prominent billing alongside John Agar and Richard Boone, she appears rather briefly, as the daughter of a ranch owner. By this time, Van Doren had grown tired of Universal, which was casting her in non-breakthrough roles. Van Doren began accepting bigger and better roles in better movies from other studios. 
Van Doren went on to star in several bad girl movies that later became cult films. She also appeared in some of the first movies to feature rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music and became identified with this rebellious style, and she made some rock records. One of her rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll films, &quot;Untamed Youth&quot;, was later featured in the 1990 &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; episode &quot;Untamed Youth&quot;.

Some of Van Doren&#x27;s more noteworthy movies include &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; (1958) at Paramount Pictures, &quot;Born Reckless&quot; (1958) at Warner Brothers, &quot;High School Confidential&quot; (1958), and &quot;The Beat Generation&quot; (1959), the latter two at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. But Van Doren was just as well known for her provocative roles. She was in prison for &quot;Girls Town&quot; (1959), which provoked censors with a shower scene where audiences could see Van Doren&#x27;s naked back. As Eve in &quot;The Private Lives of Adam and Eve&quot; (1960) she wore only fig leaves, and in other films, like &quot;The Beautiful Legs of Sabrina&quot; (1959), &quot;Sex Kittens Go to College&quot; (1960), and &quot;Vice Raid&quot; (1960) audiences understood the nature of the films from the titles.

After Universal Studios chose not to renew her contract in 1959, Van Doren became a free agent and struggled to find work. Some of her later movies were foreign and independent productions, which did little to keep her image in the public&#x27;s eye. Many of the productions were low-budget B movies with some having gained a cult following for their high camp value.

=== 1960–1969 ===
The first of these later films was &quot;Sex Kittens Go to College&quot; (1960), which co-starred Tuesday Weld. Following the completion of the Argentine film &quot;The Blonde from Buenos Aires&quot; (1961), Van Doren took time off from her career. She came back in &quot;The Candidate&quot; (1964), soon followed by &quot;Freddy in the Wild West&quot;, both of which were low-budget films that left little impact. In 1964, Tommy Noonan convinced Van Doren to appear in &quot;3 Nuts in Search of a Bolt&quot;. Van Doren had turned down Noonan&#x27;s previous offer to star opposite Jayne Mansfield in &quot;Promises! Promises!&quot;, and was replaced with Marie McDonald. In &quot;3 Nuts in Search of a Bolt&quot;, Mamie did a beer-bath scene but is not seen nude. She posed for &quot;Playboy&quot; to promote the film.

Van Doren next appeared in &quot;The Las Vegas Hillbillys&quot; (1966) released by Woolner Brothers. This film co-starred Mansfield; this was the only time two of &quot;The Three M&#x27;s&quot; appeared together in a film. A sequel was titled &quot;Hillbillys in a Haunted House&quot;, but Van Doren turned this role down, and was replaced by Joi Lansing. She then appeared in &quot;The Navy vs. the Night Monsters&quot; (1966), a science fiction movie. In 1967, she appeared in &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Be Smart&quot;, and starred in the science fiction film &quot;Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women&quot; (1968), the following year, directed by Peter Bogdanovich.

Van Doren also developed a nightclub act and did live theater. She performed in stage productions of &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; and &quot;Dames at Sea&quot; at the Drury Lane Theater in Chicago as well as appeared in &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; and &quot;The Tender Trap&quot; at the Arlington Park Theater. In the 1970s, Van Doren performed a nightclub act in Las Vegas.

Van Doren was never a Playboy Playmate, but she posed twice for the magazine in 1964 to promote her movie &quot;3 Nuts in Search of a Bolt&quot; (1964). By this point in her career, her figure measured 38DD-26-36 (self-described in 1997). She said &quot;I don&#x27;t even want to say double-D because they&#x27;re even bigger than that.&quot;

In 1964, Van Doren was a guest at the Whisky a Go Go on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California when The Beatles were at the club visiting with Jayne Mansfield, and an inebriated George Harrison accidentally threw his drink on her when trying to throw it on some bothersome journalists. During the Vietnam War, she did tours for U.S. troops in Vietnam for three months in 1968, and again in 1970. In addition to USO shows, she visited hospitals, including the wards of amputees and burn victims.

===1970–1989===
In 1970, Van Doren had a supporting role in the western comedy &quot;The Arizona Kid&quot;. In 1975, she starred in the film &quot;That Girl From Boston&quot;, adapted from a Robert Rimmer novel, but the film was never released. Since then, Van Doren has appeared only in cameos in low-budget films. Van Doren&#x27;s last film appearance was a role in the direct-to-video drama &quot; The American Tetralogy &quot; (2013). Van Doren&#x27;s guest appearances on television include &quot;Jukebox Jury&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;, &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot;, &quot;The Jack Benny Show&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;Vega$&quot; and &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. Van Doren released &quot;Playing the Field&quot; (1987), her autobiography, which brought much attention and proved to be her biggest media splash in over 25 years. She has consistently denied in interviews ever having breast implants. In 2006, Mamie posed for photographs for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; with Pamela Anderson as part of its annual Hollywood issue. In an interview with Fox News in February 2020, Van Doren announced that she was working on a follow-up to her autobiography. She remarked that &quot;...a lot has happened between 1987 and 2020. So now I&#x27;m writing about what it&#x27;s like getting older and appreciating life a little more as you go along, as well as getting smarter as you get older. There&#x27;s so much to write about.&quot;

===21st century===
The title of her follow-up book was announced in December 2021 as &quot;China &amp; Me: Wind Flapping, Feather Pulling, and Love on the Wing&quot;, a memoir about her pet parrot China. Van Doren describes the story as &quot;a look behind the curtain into my everyday life. It&#x27;s often funny, but, like so many things in life, it has its moments of sadness. Over the decades I&#x27;ve integrated a wild animal into a human household, played matchmaker to find him a mate, and cared for his offspring. I&#x27;m blessed to have had China as companion, confessor, and straight man all these years; and he&#x27;s still with me today.&quot; The book was published in September 2022.

In an interview with Closer in January 2021, she also reflected on the #MeToo movement, &#x27;I&#x27;ve thought a lot about that. There are some things I would question, but I&#x27;ve also always been behind any woman with a problem because I have had plenty of them myself. [In my time] if I wanted to go to bed with someone, I&#x27;d go to bed with them, but I never did it for a movie. [A predator] would know that he was in for a fight if he ever came around me. [It would be] nails out, kicking and screaming.&#x27;

Van Doren had a website from the late 90s to the early 2010s. In recent years, Van Doren has made use of Twitter. Van Doren had a theater section, where she would post various movies. She also showed many nude and semi-nude images taken by Julie Strain. Van Doren started her own blog on which she regularly writes about a very diverse array of topics. As of July 2023 she is still posting to her blog.
 She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7057 Hollywood Boulevard. In 2005, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to her. Van Doren holds mostly liberal views, having supported President Joe Biden, and Vice President Kamala Harris.

<text>Swishahouse is a Southern hip hop record label owned and founded by Michael &quot;5000&quot; Watts based in Houston, Texas in 1997.

== History ==
Swishahouse was founded in North Houston in 1997 by founder and President Michael &quot;5000&quot; Watts and OG Ron C as a response to the popularity of chopped and screwed music from Houston&#x27;s south side. The label began by distributing a mixtape series that featured chopped and slowed versions of R&amp;B songs. Many of the current and former artists come from Acres Homes, Homestead, Rosewood &amp; the Tidwell/Gulf Bank areas. The series includes:

*&quot; All Freestyles&quot;
*&quot;Final Chapter&quot;
*&quot;Before da Kappa&quot;
*&quot;After da Kappa&quot;
*&quot; Choppin Em Up&quot;
*&quot;Fuck Action&quot;
*&quot;Straight To Tha Room&quot; FKA &quot;Fuck Action&quot;
*&quot; The Day Hell Broke Loose&quot;
*&quot;Let Your Nutz Hang&quot;
*&quot;Rollin&#x27; Strap&quot;
*&quot;Paper Chase&quot;
*&quot;Blow One&quot;
* Juvenile Delinquent (Lil Young)
* Still Smoking
* 2kHate
A song that originally appeared on the compilation album &quot;The Day Hell Broke Loose 2&quot;, Mike Jones&#x27; &quot;Still Tippin&#x27;&quot;, achieved mainstream success in 2004. The single would go on to be certified Platinum by the RIAA. This led to Swishahouse signing a national distribution deal with Asylum Records. Jones released his major-label debut, &quot;Who Is Mike Jones?&quot;, on Swishahouse/Warner Bros. in April 2005; the album was certified Platinum by the RIAA, for selling over a million copies in the United States of America, that June.

Aftermath A&amp;R Angelo Sanders said that the great advantage to independents like Swishahouse is that, &quot;They&#x27;re able to get their product out on the streets to specific regions at a greater speed than a major ... They&#x27;re able to flood that whole Texas market with a product before the majors are able to notice what is going on out there.&quot;

Swishahouse released Paul Wall&#x27;s commercial debut studio album, &quot;The Peoples Champ&quot;‚ in September 2005. The album debuted and peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, and was ultimately certified Platinum in America. Before embarking on his rap career and while still at school, Wall had worked in the Swishahouse office.

In 2006, Houston based music label Dope House Records and Swishahouse teamed up to release South Park Mexican&#x27;s ninth album, &quot;When Devils Strike.&quot; A chopped and screwed version was also released.

Swishahouse has archives hosted by Rice University&#x27;s Center for Engaged Research and Collaborative Learning, a center under the Kinder Institute for Urban Research. The physical materials are hosted in the Woodson Research Center at the university&#x27;s Fondren Library.

<text>The Merv Griffin Show is an American television talk show starring Merv Griffin. The series had runs on two different networks on NBC (1962–1963) and CBS (1969–1972) but is most known for its run on first-run syndication from 1965 to 1969 and 1972 to 1986.

==Series history==
After a short run as a daytime show on NBC from October 1, 1962, to March 29, 1963, Merv Griffin launched a syndicated version of his talk show produced by Westinghouse Broadcasting (Group W), which made its debut on May 10, 1965. Intended as a nighttime companion to &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; and succeeding Steve Allen and Regis Philbin in the time slot, this version of the Griffin program aired in multiple time slots throughout North America (many stations ran it in the daytime, and other non-NBC affiliates broadcast it opposite &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;). Stations had the option of carrying either a sixty–minute or a ninety–minute version. Griffin&#x27;s announcer-sidekick was the veteran British character actor Arthur Treacher, who had been his mentor. After reading off the list of guests for that evening&#x27;s show, Treacher would introduce Griffin with the phrase: &quot;...and now, here&#x27;s the dear boy himself, Meeeer-vyn!&quot;

Seeing his strong ratings, CBS offered him a network series opposite the &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, and his program debuted there on August 18, 1969, with his debut guest lineup consisting of Hedy Lamarr, Ted Sorensen, Leslie Uggams, Moms Mabley, and Woody Allen. Although the series did well enough to quickly force the cancellation of another Carson competitor, ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;, it was unable to make much of a dent in Carson&#x27;s ratings. Furthermore, the network was uncomfortable with the guests Griffin wanted, who often spoke out against the Vietnam War and on other taboo topics. When political activist Abbie Hoffman was Griffin&#x27;s guest in April 1970, CBS blurred the video of Hoffman so viewers at home would not see his trademark American flag pattern shirt, even though other guests had worn the same shirt in the past, uncensored, and Pat Boone appeared in an automobile commercial on that very broadcast wearing a similar flag-motif shirt.

That same year, Griffin relocated his show from New York&#x27;s Cort Theatre to CBS Television City in Los Angeles, without sidekick Arthur Treacher, who told him &quot;at my age, I don&#x27;t want to move, especially to someplace that shakes!&quot;. From that point on, Griffin would do the announcing himself, and walk on stage with the phrase: &quot;And now..., here I come!&quot;

However, Griffin&#x27;s show continued to rank in second place behind Carson, even after the move. By late summer 1971, sensing that his time at CBS was ending, Griffin sought to exit his contract with the network early. CBS would soon agree, and on December 6, 1971, both Griffin and the network announced they were going their separate ways; CBS would replace Griffin with &quot;The CBS Late Movie&quot;. The following day, Griffin signed a contract with Metromedia and its production arm, Metromedia Producers Corporation (MPC) to continue his program in syndication. The last edition of &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; on CBS aired February 11, 1972. His new MPC-distributed show began four weeks later, on March 13, 1972, and returned Griffin to late afternoon and late–night time slots. Metromedia also gave Griffin prime time clearances on the company&#x27;s group of independent stations, which included outlets in New York, Los Angeles, Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Cincinnati and Washington, D.C. Beginning in 1981, &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; was cut back to one hour in order to accommodate stations who preferred that length over the 90-minute version.

King World Productions (now CBS Media Ventures) took over syndication of the program in 1984; King World was Griffin&#x27;s syndication partner for &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and was about to relaunch his other game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; (Metromedia had briefly syndicated the original &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; a decade prior and would initially provide the studio for the revival). Metromedia&#x27;s independent stations continued to carry &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; until they were sold in early 1986 to News Corporation and 20th Century Fox, who used the stations as the nucleus of the Fox Broadcasting Company. As Fox was already setting up its own late-night talk show, &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot;, the former Metromedia stations dropped the show soon thereafter. The show was canceled altogether later that year, and aired its final episode on September 5, 1986.

==Overview==
Griffin&#x27;s conversational style created the perfect atmosphere for conducting intelligent interviews that could be serious with some and light-hearted with others. Rather than interview a guest for a cursory five or six minute segment, Griffin preferred lengthy, in-depth discussions with many stretching out past 30 minutes. In addition, Griffin sometimes dedicated an entire show to a single person or topic, allowing for greater exploration of his guests’ personality and thoughts.

Griffin’s idea of the perfect show was to have as many diverse guests as possible, from entertainers to scientists, Hollywood glamour to Vegas variety, and from comedians to political leaders. A perfect example lies in an episode from September 1965 which featured the zany comedian Phyllis Diller followed by an interview with Capt. Mitsuo Fuchida, the Japanese navy officer who planned and led the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941— a truly unique moment in television history.

For over a quarter of a century, more than 25,000 guests appeared on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; including numerous significant cultural, political, social and musical icons of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Four American presidents–Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan appeared, as did Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Jonas Salk and Robert F. Kennedy. Legendary actors and directors who appeared on the program include Orson Welles, John Wayne, Judy Garland (who took over as guest hostess for Griffin on one program in January 1969, six months before her death), Doris Day (Griffin&#x27;s longtime friend), Robert De Niro, Tom Cruise, Sophia Loren, George Clooney, Tom Hanks, Gene Wilder, Francis Ford Coppola, Dustin Hoffman, Clint Eastwood and Grace Kelly. Musical performers and composers ranging from Devo to Aretha Franklin with Bobby Vinton, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Marvin Gaye, Merle Haggard, The Bee Gees and Johnny Cash, among others, all guesting. &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; hosted Whitney Houston’s first TV appearance in 1983. Sports figures interviewed by Griffin on the show include Muhammad Ali, Joe Namath, Roger Maris, Willie Mays and Reggie Jackson. In addition, many of the most important comedians of the era were on the show including early performances by George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Andy Kaufman, Steve Martin, Jerry Lewis, and Jerry Seinfeld, who made his TV debut on the show in 1981. Other notable guests that rarely made TV appearances showed up to talk to Griffin include Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Andy Warhol, Norman Rockwell and Salvador Dalí.

Griffin&#x27;s longtime bandleader was Mort Lindsey. Griffin frequently clowned and sang novelty songs with trumpeter Jack Sheldon.

In 2012, Reelin&#x27; In the Years Productions started handling all rights to the series on behalf of The Griffin Group. As of February 2014, 1,800 episodes, spanning over 2,000 hours of footage, have been located and preserved for future generations. Episodes of the show have been released on DVDs. Selected edited episodes, distributed by Paul Brownstein Productions, are airing on the GetTV channel.

==In popular culture==

&quot;Seinfeld&quot; spoofed the show in Season 9, Episode 6, “The Merv Griffin Show,” in which Cosmo Kramer pretends that he hosts his own talk show using the discarded set from the show, which he sets up in his apartment.

Andy Kaufman&#x27;s appearance on the show was a feature in the plot of the 1999 biopic &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, with Griffin being played by character actor Mike Villani. The movie claims that all guests of the show receive an autographed photo of Griffin, coupons, and Turtle Wax.

&quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; was parodied on &quot;Second City Television&quot;, with Griffin played by Rick Moranis. The sketches included a crossover with &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and a mash-up of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;.

Since making her TV debut on The Merv Griffin Show with the song in June 1983, pop/R&amp;B singer Whitney Houston’s performance of “Home” has been used frequently. The performance is included on DVD (2000), the DVD version of Houston’s 25th anniversary debut album (2010), “We Will Always Love You: A Grammy Salute to Whitney Houston” (2012), Whitney Houston Live: Her Greatest Performances (2014), and the 2018 docu-film &quot;Whitney&quot;. The performance is considered one of Houston’s best and her introduction to the music world.

<text>International political economy (IPE) is the study of how politics shapes the global economy and how the global economy shapes politics. A key focus in IPE is on the power of different actors such as nation states, international organizations and multinational corporations to shape the international economic system and the distributive consequences of international economic activity. It has been described as the study of &quot;the political battle between the winners and losers of global economic exchange.&quot;

A central assumption of IPE theory is that international economic phenomena do not exist in any meaningful sense separate from the actors who regulate and control them. Alongside formal economic theories of international economics, trade, and finance, which are widely utilised within the discipline, IPE thus stresses the study of institutions, politics, and power relations in understanding the global economy.

The substantive issue areas of IPE are frequently divided into the four broad subject areas of 1. international trade, 2. the international monetary and financial system, 3. multinational corporations, and 4. economic development and inequality. Key actors of study may include international organizations, multinational corporations, and sovereign states.

International political economy is a major subdiscipline of international relations where it emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, prompted by the growth of international economic institutions such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, alongside economic turmoils such as the fall of the gold standard, 1973 oil crisis, and 1970s recession. IPE is also a major field of study within history, especially economic history, where scholars study the historical dynamics of the international political economy.

==History and emergence ==
International political economy has its historic roots in the discipline of political economy; the study of the national economy and its interactions with governance and politics. Adam Smith&#x27;s publication of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; profoundly influenced the development of the field of political economy.

While the newly founded discipline of economics; which studies economic phenomena absent political and social considerations; began to diverge from political economy studies in the late 19th century, political economy continued to live as an academic tradition within political science departments, as well as within modern economics as a pluralist approach. While notable works from John Maynard Keynes&#x27; &quot;General Theory&quot; and Karl Polanyi&#x27;s &quot;The Great Transformation&quot; published in the early 20th century are still written in the tradition of political economy, economics in its narrower form was dominating economics departments from the 1920s and onward.

The emergence of international political economy can be traced to the late 1960s and early 1970s, when deepening economic interdependence prompted by the growth of post-war economic institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, drew increasing attention within international relations scholarship towards the study of these institutions, and more broadly, to the study of governance of the world economy. The need for a more comprehensive understanding on global economic governance within political science circles became increasingly apparent through the crises of the 1970s; with the end of the gold standard, the 1973 oil crisis, 1973-1975 recession and calls for greater trade protection. Influential figures in the emergence of the discipline were international relations scholars Robert Keohane, Joseph Nye and Robert Gilpin in the United States, as well as Susan Strange in the United Kingdom. IPE has since become a key pillar in political science departments as well as a major subdiscipline of international relations, alongside traditional international relations scholarship centred on material security.

== Topics of enquiry ==

===International Finance===

International finance and monetary relations is one of the core areas of study in IPE. In IPE scholarship, the interrelation of economic and political interests in international finance assumes it impossible to separate the financial system from international politics in any meaningful sense. The IPE of international finance is characterized by political network effects and international externalities, such as beggar-thy-neighbour effects and contagions.

A key concept in IPE literature on international finance is the impossible trinity, derived from the Mundell–Fleming model, which holds that it is impossible to simultaneously pursue all of the following three economic policies:

* a fixed foreign exchange rate
* free capital movement; absence of capital controls
* an independent monetary policy

Another key dilemma in monetary policy is that governments have to balance the inflation rate (the price of money at home) and the exchange rate (the price of money outside the home market).

There is no agreement in the economics literature on the optimal national exchange rate policy. Rather, national exchange rate regimes reflect political considerations. National exchange rate policies can be 1. fixed, floating, or a hybrid of the two, and 2. entail a strong or weak currency. Different groups benefit disproportionately depending on the national exchange rate policies that is chosen.

The liberal view point generally has been strong in Western academia since it was first articulated by Smith in the eighteenth century. Only during the 1940s to early 1970s did an alternative system, Keynesianism, command wide support in universities. Keynes was concerned chiefly with domestic macroeconomic policy. The Keynesian consensus was challenged by Friedrich Hayek and later Milton Friedman and other scholars out of Chicago as early as the 1950s, and by the 1970s, Keynes&#x27; influence on public discourse and economic policy making had somewhat faded.

After World War II, the Bretton Woods system was established, reflecting the political orientation described as embedded liberalism. In 1971 President Richard Nixon ended the convertibility of gold that had been established under the IMF in the Bretton Woods system. Interim agreements followed. Nonetheless, until 2008 the trend has been for increasing liberalization of both international trade and finance. From later 2008 world leaders have also been increasingly calling for a New Bretton Woods System.

Topics such as the International Monetary Fund, Financial Crises (see Financial crisis of 2007–2008 and 1997 Asian financial crisis), exchange rates, Foreign Direct Investment, Multinational Corporations receive much attention in IPE.

===International Trade===

There are multiple approaches to trade within IPE. These approaches seek to explain international bargaining between states, as well as the foreign economic policies that states adopt. In terms of domestic explanations for the foreign economic policies of states, the two dominant approaches are the factor model and sector model, both of which build on David Ricardo&#x27;s theory of comparative advantage.

The factor model (which has been called the H-O-S-S model) is shaped by the Heckscher-Ohlin model and the Stolper-Samuelsson theorem. According to the Heckscher-Ohlin model of trade, the comparative advantage of countries in trade stems from their endowments of particular factors of trade (land, labor, capital). This means that a country abundant in land will primarily export land-intensive products (such as agriculture), whereas a country abundant in capital will export capital-intensive products (such as high-technology manufacturing) and a country abundant in labor will export labor-intensive products (such as textiles). Building on this model, the Stolper-Samuelsson theorem holds that groups that possess the factors will support or oppose trade depending on the abundance or scarcity of the factors. This means that in a country which is abundant in land and scarce in capital, farmers will support free trade whereas producers in capital-intensive manufacturing will oppose free trade. The factor model predicts that labor in developed countries will oppose trade liberalization (because it is relatively scarce), whereas labor in developing countries will support free trade (because it is relatively abundant).

Building on these insights, influential research by Ronald Rogowski argued that factor endowments predicted whether countries were characterized by class-conflict (capital vs. labor) or urban-rural conflict. Similarly, an influential study by Helen Milner and Keiko Kubota argues that factor endowments explain why developing countries liberalize their trade after they democratize (the abundant factor, labor, supports trade liberalization). A 2023 study by Milner and Lindsay R. Dolan found that factor endowments help explain trade preferences in Africa. Research has substantiated the predictions of the Stolper-Samuelsson theorem, showing that trade openness tends to reduce inequality in developing countries, but exacerbate it in advanced economies.

The sectors model of trade, the Ricardo–Viner model (named after David Ricardo and Jacob Viner), challenges the notion that factors are key to understanding trade preferences. Factors can be highly immobile, which means that capital-owners and labor who work in a particular sector may have similar interests. As a consequence, trade preferences are better understood by examining which economic sectors win or lose on trade liberalization. Whereas the factor model assumes that capital-owners in different sectors have similar trade preferences and that labor across different sector have similar trade preferences, the Ricardo-Viner model holds that in sectors where factors are immobile, labor and capital-owners in one sector may have the same trade preferences. As a result, the Ricardo-Viner model predicts that class conflict over trade is more likely when factors are highly mobile, but that industry-based conflict is more likely when factors are immobile.

Adam Dean has challenged the economic assumptions in both models, arguing that workers&#x27; wages do not consistently correspond to increases in productivity in a given industry (contradicting Ricardo-Viner) nor do workers consistently benefit from import restrictions when labor is the scarce factor of endowment (contradicting Heckscher-Ohlin). The degree to which Ricardo-Viner and Heckscher-Ohlin are correct is conditioned by whether workers have profit-sharing institutions or are unionized (which helps them to bargain for higher wages amid productivity increases). He has also challenged Milner and Kubota&#x27;s study on trade liberalization in developing countries, as he shows that democratic developing countries frequently repressed labor unions amid trade liberalization.

Studies by Dani Rodrik and Anna Mayda, as well as Kenneth Scheve and Matthew J. Slaughter have found support for the factor models, as they show that there is greater support for trade openness in developing countries (where labor is abundant and thus benefits from trade openness). Other studies find no support for either model, and argue that the models have limited explanatory value. A 2022 study in the &quot;Journal of Politics&quot; found that comparative advantage predicts attitudes on free trade among individuals and legislators. According to a 2017 assessment by Thomas Oatley, there are &quot;no strong conclusions&quot; in IPE scholarship as to which of these models better characterizes the sources of individual trade policies.

Aside from the sector and factor models, there are firm-specific models of trade preferences (some times described as &quot;New new&quot; trade theory) which predict that those who work for large, productive and globally oriented firms support trade liberalization (as well as free movement of capital and labor), whereas employees in smaller firms are less supportive of free trade. Economic geography approaches explain trade policies by looking at the regions that benefit and lose on globalization; it predicts that large cities support trade liberalization and that left-behind regions push back on liberalization. Other alternative models to the factor and sector models may explain individual preferences through demographic data (age, class, skills, education, gender), as well as ideology and culture. Some studies have raised questions about whether individuals understand the effects of trade protectionism, which puts doubt on theories that assume that trade policy preferences are rooted in economic self-interest.

Trade may in and of itself alter domestic politics, including the trade preferences of the public. A 1988 study by Helen Milner found that trade openness substantially increased support for free trade by strengthening the position of firms that stand to lose from trade protectionism. Influential studies by David Cameron, Dani Rodrik and Peter Katzenstein have affirmed the insights of the Double Movement, as they show that greater trade openness has been associated with increases in government social spending.

In terms of how preferences get aggregated and reconciled into foreign economic policies, IPE scholars have pointed to collective action problems, electoral systems, regime types, veto points, the nature of the legislative trade policy process, the interaction between domestic and international bargaining, and the interactions between political elites and epistemic communities. Some IPE scholarship de-emphasizes the role of domestic politics and points to international processes as shapers of trade policy. Some scholars have argued for a &quot;new interdependence&quot; approach, which restores insights from the complex interdependence of the 1970s, but emphasizes network effects, control over central nodes, and path dependence.

===Economic development===

IPE is also concerned with development economics and explaining how and why countries develop.

==Historical IPE approaches==
Historically, three prominent approaches to IPE were the liberal, economic nationalist (mercantilist), and marxist perspectives.

Economic liberals tend to oppose government intervention in the market when it inhibits free trade and open competition, but support government intervention to protect property rights and resolve market failures. Economic liberals commonly adhere to a political and economic philosophy which advocates a restrained fiscal policy and the balancing of budgets, through measures such as low taxes, reduced government spending, and minimized government debt.

To economic nationalists, markets are subordinate to the state, and should serve the interests of the state (such as providing national security and accumulating military power). The doctrine of mercantilism is a prominent variant of economic nationalism. Economic nationalists tend to see international trade as zero-sum, where the goal is to derive relative gains (as opposed to mutual gains). Economic nationalism tends to emphasize industrialization (and often aids industries with state support), due to beliefs that industry has positive spillover effects on the rest of the economy, enhances the self-sufficiency and political autonomy of the country, and is a crucial aspect in building military power.

== Modern IPE approaches ==
There are several prominent approaches to IPE. The dominant paradigm is Open Economy Politics. Other influential approaches include dependency theory, hegemonic stability theory, and domestic political theories of IPE.

Early modern IPE scholarship employed a diversity of methods and did both grand theory and middle range theory, but over time, the scholarship has become more quantitative and focused on middle-range theories. Robert Jervis wrote in 1998, &quot;the IPE subfield, after a marvelous period of development in the 1970s and 1980s seems to be stagnating.&quot;

The first wave of IPE scholarship focused on complex interdependence and the evolution of global systems of economic exchange. This scholarship focused on hegemonic stability theory, complex interdependence, and regimes. The second wave sought to explain the domestic sources of global economic cooperation or explain how global processes influence domestic policy-making. The third wave increasingly focused on explaining the micro-foundations of policy. According to Benjamin Cohen, &quot;in terms of theory, consensus is often lacking on even the most basic causal relationships&quot; in IPE scholarship.

=== Open Economy Politics ===
Open Economy Politics (OEP) can be traced to domestic political theories of IPE; OEP emerged in the late 1990s. OEP adopts the assumptions of neoclassical economics and international trade theory. It strongly emphasizes microfoundations. It has been characterized as employing rationalism, materialism and liberalism. According to David Lake,

# Interests: &quot;OEP begins with individuals, sectors, or factors of production as the units of analysis and derives their interests over economic policy from each unit&#x27;s position within the international economy.&quot;
# Domestic institutions: &quot;It conceives of domestic political institutions as mechanisms that aggregate interests (with more or less bias) and structure the bargaining of competing societal groups.&quot;
# International bargaining: &quot;It introduces, when necessary, bargaining between states with different interests. Analysis within OEP proceeds from the most micro- to the most macro-level in a linear and orderly fashion, reflecting an implicit uni-directional conception of politics as flowing up from individuals to interstate bargaining.&quot;

Thomas Oatley has criticized OEP for an overemphasis on domestic political processes and for failing to consider the interplay between processes at the domestic level and macro processes at the global level: in essence, OEP scholarship suffers from omitted variable bias. According to Peter Katzenstein, Robert Keohane and Stephen Krasner, scholarship in this vein assumes that actors&#x27; preferences and behavior are derived from their material position, which leads to a neglect of the ways in which variation in information may shape actor preferences and behaviors. Mark Blyth and Matthias Matthijs argue that OEP scholarship essentially black boxes the global economy. Stephanie Rickard has defended the OEP approach, writing in 2021:OEP has matured and developed over the past decade. As a framework, it has proven to be enormously productive and adaptable—integrating diverse economic phenomena under a common theoretical umbrella and providing a framework flexible enough to react to significant events in the global economy... The accumulating body of scholarship in the OEP tradition has moved our understanding of world politics decisively forward. Critics of OEP have yet to offer an alternative, more empirically powerful theory and as a result, OEP continues to progress as the dominant paradigm in IPE research.Scholars have questioned the empirical validity of the models derived from OEP scholarship on money and trade, as well as questioned the ability of OEP scholarship to explain momentous events in global political economy. Challengers to the OEP framework include behavioral approaches (which do not necessarily accept that individual interests stem from material incentives), and economic geography approaches. According to Stephanie Rickard, OEP scholars have modified their models to incorporate incomplete information (which affects how individual preferences are formed) and economies of scale (which affects the distribution of gains and losses). Erica Owen and Stephanie Walter similarly argue that &quot;second-generation&quot; OEP frameworks incorporate both material and ideational preferences.

=== Dependency theory ===
Dependency theory is the notion that resources flow from a &quot;periphery&quot; of poor and underdeveloped states to a &quot;core&quot; of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the &quot;world system&quot;. This theory was officially developed in the late 1960s following World War II, as scholars searched for the root issue in the lack of development in Latin America.

Dependency theory and world systems theory are not mainstream economic theory.

=== Hegemonic stability theory ===
Early IPE scholarship was focused on the implications of hegemony on international economic affairs. In the 1970s, US hegemony appeared to be on the fall, which prompted scholars to consider the likely effects of this falling. Robert Keohane coined the term Hegemonic stability theory in a 1980 article for the notion that the international system is more likely to remain stable when a single nation-state is the dominant world power, or hegemon. Keohane&#x27;s 1984 book &quot;After Hegemony&quot;, used insights from the new institutional economics, to argue that the international system could remain stable in the absence of a hegemon.

=== American vs. British IPE ===

Benjamin Cohen provides a detailed intellectual history of IPE identifying American and British camps. The Americans are positivist and attempt to develop intermediate level theories that are supported by some form of quantitative evidence. British IPE is more &quot;interpretivist&quot; and looks for &quot;grand theories&quot;. They use very different standards of empirical work. Cohen sees benefits in both approaches. A special edition of &quot;New Political Economy&quot; has been issued on The &#x27;British School&#x27; of IPE and a special edition of the &quot;Review of International Political Economy&quot; (RIPE) on American IPE.

==Journals==
The leading journal for IPE scholarship is the generalist international relations journal &quot;International Organization&quot;. &quot;International Organization&quot; played an instrumental role in making IPE one of the prominent subfields in IR. The leading IPE-specific journals are the &quot;Review of International Political Economy&quot; and &quot;New Political Economy&quot;. Examples of journals within the historical study of IPE are Economic History Review and History of Political Economy.

<doc id="630344" wikidata="Q2359788" url="?curid=630344" title="List of Oceanids">
<text>In Greek mythology, the nymph daughters of the Titan Oceanus (Ocean), were known collectively as the Oceanids. Four ancient sources give lists of names of Oceanids. The oldest, and longest such list, given by the late 8th–early 7th century BC Greek poet Hesiod, names 41 Oceanids. Hesiod goes on to say that these &quot;are the eldest ... but there are many besides&quot; and that there were &quot;three thousand&quot; Oceanids, a number interpreted as meaning &quot;innumerable&quot;. While some of these names, such as Peitho, Metis and Tyche, certainly reflected existing traditions, many were probably mere poetic inventions. The probably nearly as old &quot;Homeric Hymn to Demeter&quot; lists twenty-one names, sixteen of which match those given by Hesiod, and were probably taken directly from there.

The roughly contemporary (? ) Greek mythographer Apollodorus and the Latin mythographer Hyginus also give lists of Oceanids. Apollodorus gives a list containing seven names, as well as mentioning five other Oceanids elsewhere. Of these twelve names, eight match Hesiod. Hyginus, at the beginning of his &quot;Fabulae&quot;, lists sixteen names, while elsewhere he gives the names of ten others. Of these 26 names, only nine are found in Hesiod, the &quot;Homeric Hymn&quot;, or Apollodorus. Many other names are given in other ancient sources.

The names of the Oceanids are of different types. The Oceanids were the nymphs of springs, and some of the names apparently reflect this aquatic connection, with some perhaps being the names of actual springs. Other names have no apparent connection with water. Some, consistent with the Oceanids&#x27; function, as specified by Hesiod, of having &quot;youths in their keeping&quot; (i.e. being &quot;kourotrophoi&quot;), represent things which parents might hope to be bestowed upon their children: Plouto (&quot;Wealth&quot;), Tyche (&quot;Good Fortune&quot;), Idyia (&quot;Knowing&quot;), and Metis (&quot;Wisdom&quot;). Others appear to be geographical eponyms, such as Europa, Asia, Ephyra (Corinth), and Rhodos (Rhodes).

Several of the names given for Oceanids, are also names given for Nereids, the fifty sea nymphs who were the daughters of the sea god Nereus and the Oceanid Doris.

<doc id="630350" wikidata="Q143359" url="?curid=630350" title="Capelin">
<text>The capelin or caplin (Mallotus villosus) is a small forage fish of the smelt family found in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Arctic oceans. In summer, it grazes on dense swarms of plankton at the edge of the ice shelf. Larger capelin also eat a great deal of krill and other crustaceans. Among others, whales, seals, Atlantic cod, Atlantic mackerel, squid and seabirds prey on capelin, in particular during the spawning season while the capelin migrate south. Capelin spawn on sand and gravel bottoms or sandy beaches at the age of two to six years. When spawning on beaches, capelin have an extremely high post-spawning mortality rate which, for males, is close to 100%.
Males reach in length, while females are up to long. They are olive-coloured dorsally, shading to silver on sides. Males have a translucent ridge on both sides of their bodies. The ventral aspects of the males iridesce reddish at the time of spawn.

The closest relative of the capelin appears to have been the extinct fossil genus &quot;Enoplophthalmus&quot;, which inhabited Europe during the early Oligocene and early Miocene.

== Capelin migration ==

Capelin populations in the Barents Sea and around Iceland perform extensive seasonal migrations. Barents Sea capelin migrate during winter and early spring to the coast of northern Norway (Finnmark) and the Kola Peninsula (Russia) for spawning. During summer and autumn, capelin migrate north- and north-eastward for feeding.

Icelandic capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in the plankton-rich oceanic area between Iceland, Greenland, and Jan Mayen. Capelin distribution and migration is linked with ocean currents and water masses. Around Iceland, maturing capelin usually undertake extensive northward feeding migrations in spring and summer, and the return migration takes place in September to November. The spawning migration starts from north of Iceland in December to January. In 2009, researchers from Iceland made an interacting particle model of the capelin stock around Iceland, successfully predicting the spawning migration route for the previous year.

==Reproduction==
As an r-selected species, capelin have a high reproductive potential and an intrinsic population growth rate. They reproduce by spawning and their main spawning season occurs in spring but can extend into the summer. The majority of capelin are three or four years old when they spawn. The males migrate directly to the shallow water of fjords, where spawning will take place, while the females remain in deeper water until they are completely mature. Once the females are mature, they migrate to the spawning grounds and spawn. This process usually takes place at night. In the North European Atlantic spawning typically occurs over sand or gravel at depths of , but in the North Pacific and waters off Newfoundland most spawn on beaches, jumping as far up land as possible, with some managing to strand themselves in the process. Although some other fish species leave their eggs in locations that dry out (a few, such as plainfin midshipman, may even remain on land with the eggs during low tide) or on plants above the water (splash tetras), jumping onto land &quot;en masse&quot; to spawn is unique to the capelin, grunions, and grass puffer. In beach-spawning capelin populations, after the female capelins have spawned, they immediately leave the spawning grounds and can spawn again in the following years if they survive. The males do not leave the spawning grounds and potentially spawn more than once throughout the season. Beach-spawning male capelin are considered to be semelparous because they die soon after the spawning season is over. In ocean spawning capelin populations, it has been observed that both male and female capelin are semelparous and die after spawning. This difference observed between capelin populations shows that capelin are physiologically capable of an iteroparous or semelparous reproductive mode depending on spawning habitat.

Studies on two populations of Newfoundland capelin which spawn in two distinct habitats found a lack of evidence of genetic variability between beach and deep-water spawners. This provides support for the species being facultative spawners. Capelin may select optimal spawning location based on abiotic factors such as temperature range and sediment. The optimal temperature range for capelin eggs that leads to greatest hatching success and offspring quality appears when eggs are incubated between . This optimal temperature range provides support that individual capelin are able to select spawning location based on temperature, as temperature is one of the most variable factors between beach and deep-water spawning habitats for capelin. There is also evidence that shows that temperature is not the only factor at play when it comes to selection of spawning habitat. When both habitats are simultaneously experiencing temperatures in the optimal range, capelin are found to spawn in both habitats. This may be an advantageous strategy that leads to increased fitness. Capelin have been observed to spawn at beaches when deep-water or subtidal habitat is lower than and spawn in deep-water habitats when beach habitats temperature is consistently above .

== Diet ==
Capelin are planktivorous fishes that forage in the pelagic zone. Studies analyzing diet in populations of capelin in both the arctic marine environment as well as in west Greenland waters show that their diet consists upon primarily euphausiids, amphipods, and copepods. As capelin individuals grow, the composition of their diet changes. Smaller capelin primarily consume smaller prey (copepods) and shift their diet towards feeding on primarily larger euphausiids and amphipods as body and gape size increases. The sufficient distribution and abundance of these zooplankton is necessary for capelin to meet energy requirements for progressing through many stages of their life cycle. Capelin occupy a similar dietary niche as polar cod, which leads to a potential for interspecific competition between the two species.

==Fisheries==

Capelin is an important forage fish, and is essential as the key food of the Atlantic cod. The northeast Atlantic cod and capelin fisheries, therefore, are managed by a multispecies approach developed by the main resource owners Norway and Russia.

In some years with large quantities of Atlantic herring in the Barents Sea, capelin seem to be heavily affected. Probably both food competition and herring feeding on capelin larvae lead to collapses in the capelin stock. In some years, though good recruitment of capelin despite a high herring biomass suggests that herring are only one factor influencing capelin dynamics.

In the provinces of Quebec (particularly in the Gaspé peninsula) and Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, it is a regular summertime practice for locals to go to the beach and scoop the capelin up in nets or whatever is available, as the capelin &quot;roll in&quot; in the millions each year at the end of May or in early June.

Commercially, capelin is used for fish meal and oil industry products, but is also appreciated as food. The flesh is agreeable in flavour, resembling herring. Capelin roe (&quot;masago&quot;) is considered a high-value product in Japan. It is also sometimes mixed with wasabi or green food colouring and wasabi flavour and sold as &quot;wasabi caviar&quot;. Often,&quot; masago&quot; is commercialised as &quot;ebiko&quot; and used as a substitute for &quot;tobiko&quot;, flying fish roe, owing to its similar appearance and taste, although the mouthfeel is different due to the individual eggs being smaller and less crunchy than tobiko.

<text>In military organisation, unity of command is the principle that subordinate members of a structure should all be responsible to a single commander. 

==United States==
The military of the United States considers unity of command as one of the twelve principles of joint operations:
==Military problems==
When the principle of unity of command is violated problems quickly develop. An example occurred in Afghanistan in 2006 when Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan passed control of the ground fight to the International Security Assistance Force. This caused the operations to split between several unified commanders in charge of U.S. Central Command, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the U.S. Special Operations Command, which caused significant operational problems.

<text>Dungeon Siege is an action role-playing game developed by Gas Powered Games and published by Microsoft in April 2002 for Microsoft Windows and the following year by Destineer for Mac OS X. Set in the pseudo-medieval kingdom of Ehb, the high fantasy game follows a young farmer and her companions as they journey to defeat an invading force. Initially only seeking to warn the nearby town of the invasion of a race of creatures named the Krug, the farmer and the companions that join her along the way are soon swept up in finding a way to defeat another race called the Seck, resurgent after being trapped for 300 years. Unlike other role-playing video games of the time, the world of &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; does not have levels but is a single, continuous area without loading screens that the player journeys through, fighting hordes of enemies. Also, rather than setting character classes and manually controlling all of the characters in the group, the player controls their overall tactics and weapons and magic usage, which direct their character growth.

&quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; was the first title by Gas Powered Games, which was founded in May 1998 by Chris Taylor, then known for the 1997 real-time strategy game &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;. Joined by several of his coworkers from Cavedog Entertainment, Taylor wanted to create a different type of game, and after trying several concepts they decided to make an action role-playing game as their first title. Taylor also served as one of the designers for the game, joined by Jacob McMahon as the other lead designer and producer and Neal Hallford as the lead story and dialogue writer. The music was composed by Jeremy Soule, who had also worked on &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;. Gas Powered Games concentrated on making a role-playing game that was stripped of the typical genre elements they found slow or frustrating, to keep the player focused on the action. Development took over four years, though it was initially planned to take only two; completing the game within even four years required the team to work 12- to 14-hour days and weekends for most of the time.

The game was highly rated by critics upon release; it is listed by review aggregator Metacritic as the third-highest rated computer role-playing game of 2002. Critics praised the graphics and seamless world, as well as the fun and accessible gameplay, but were dismissive of the plot. &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; sold over 1.7 million copies, and was nominated for the Computer Role-Playing Game of the Year award by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences. Gas Powered Games emphasized creating and releasing tools for players to use in making mods for the game during development, which resulted in an active modding community after release. An expansion pack, &quot;Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna&quot;, was released in 2003, and a further series of games was developed in the franchise, consisting of &quot;Dungeon Siege II&quot; (2005) and its own expansion &quot;Dungeon Siege II: Broken World&quot; (2006), a spinoff PlayStation Portable game titled &quot;Dungeon Siege: Throne of Agony&quot; (2006), and a third main title, &quot;Dungeon Siege III&quot; (2011). A trilogy of movies, with the first loosely inspired by the plot of &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot;, were released as &quot;In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale&quot; (2007, theaters), &quot;In the Name of the King 2: Two Worlds&quot; (2011, home video), and &quot;In the Name of the King 3: The Last Mission&quot; (2014, home video).

&quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; is an action role-playing game set in a pseudo-medieval high fantasy world, presented in 3D with a third-person virtual camera system under the control of the player, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player chooses the gender and customizes the appearance of the main character of the story prior to the start of the game and typically controls them. The main character is joined by up to seven other characters, which are controlled via artificial intelligence; the player may switch which character they are controlling at any time. The other characters move in relation to the controlled character according to the formation and level of aggression towards enemies chosen by the player. The additional characters can be removed from the group and re-recruited at any given time.

The game world is not broken up into levels, but is instead one large area not separated by loading screens. As the player journeys through the largely linear world, they encounter numerous monsters and enemies of varying types that attack whenever the party of player characters approach. The party defends themselves and attacks enemies using melee and ranged weapons, and nature and combat magic. The player does not select a character class for the characters, unlike other role-playing video games; instead, using weapons or magic of a particular type increases the character&#x27;s skill with them over time. Whenever a player gains enough experience points from killing enemies and reaches a new level in that weapon type, they gain some number of points in their strength, dexterity, or intelligence statistics, which in turn relate to the number of health points and mana that they have, and damage that they do with weapons.

Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, which provide attack or defense points, or give bonuses to some other statistic. There are also usable items such as potions to restore a character&#x27;s health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other items are found by killing enemies, breaking containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has an inventory, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.

&quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; has both a single-player and multiplayer mode. The single-player mode consists of a single story and world; players can either create a new character when starting the story or use one created in a prior playthrough. The cooperative multiplayer mode allows for up to eight players to play through either the single-player storyline or in the multiplayer map, which features a central town hub with increasingly difficult enemies as players move away from it. Multiplayer games can be set to different difficulty levels, allowing accommodation of higher-leveled characters. Additional maps can be created by players that can allow for competitive multiplayer instead. Multiplayer matches can be created and joined via local area networks, direct IP addresses, and, prior to its closure in 2006, through the Microsoft Zone matchmaking service.

==Plot==
&quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; is set in the Kingdom of Ehb, a varied region on the continent of Aranna containing deserts, swamps, forests, and mountains, created three centuries earlier at the dissolution of the Empire of Stars. At the beginning of the game, the player character&#x27;s farming village is attacked by a race of creatures named the Krug. The main character, a farmer with no given background who is named by the player, journeys through the Krug forces to the town of Stonebridge. Upon breaking the siege of the town, and gaining their first companion, the player character is tasked by the town&#x27;s garrison leader Gyorn with journeying to the town of Glacern and alerting the Ehb military forces, called the 10th Legion, of the incursion and defeating any forces they encounter along the way. After journeying through crypts, mines, and mountains, the player character reaches Glacern, where they are informed that the Krug invasion happened the same day that the Grand Mage Merik disappeared, and are charged with traveling over the mountains to Fortress Kroth to assist the legion there. In the mountains they find Merik, who informs them that the Krug invasion is part of a larger invasion by the Seck, who destroyed the Empire of Stars before being imprisoned underneath Castle Ehb, and who have escaped and taken the castle. Merik asks the player to help recover the Staff of Stars from the Goblins. Prior to its theft, the Staff had kept the Seck imprisoned in the Vault of Eternity.

The player fights through monsters and bandits in crystal caves, a forest, a swamp, and an underground Goblin fortress filled with mechanical war machines. After recovering the Staff from the Goblins, the player character meets a division of the 10th Legion and is pointed towards Fortress Kroth, which has been overrun with undead. After clearing the fortress and fighting monsters and a dragon in the Cliffs of Fire, they march on Castle Ehb. The player characters then storm the castle and fight through the Seck forces to rescue King Konreid. He informs the party that the Seck&#x27;s leader, Gom, is seeking the magical weapons from the Empire of Stars stored in the Chamber of Stars, and that the characters must secure the weapons and then defeat the remaining Seck. The player character collects the weapons and fights through lava caves and the Vault of Eternity where the Seck had been imprisoned. The player character kills Gom, defeating the Seck and saving the kingdom.

==Development==

Gas Powered Games was founded in May 1998 by Chris Taylor, then known for the 1997 real-time strategy game &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;. Joined by several of his coworkers from Cavedog Entertainment, Taylor wanted to create a different type of game than before, and after trying several concepts the team decided to make an action role-playing game as their first title. As well as helping create the initial concept, Taylor served as one of the designers for the game, joined by Jacob McMahon as the game&#x27;s other lead designer and producer and Neal Hallford as the game&#x27;s lead story and dialogue writer. Hallford was brought onto the project after it had already started; Taylor had devised the start and end of the game but left the intervening details and background story to him. The game&#x27;s music was composed by Jeremy Soule, who had also worked on &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;. The development team included around thirty people during development, with changes over time, and reached forty at the project&#x27;s conclusion. The development of the game took over four years, though it was initially planned to take only two.

&quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; was inspired by prior role-playing games such as &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; and the &quot;Ultima&quot; series, but primarily by &quot;Diablo&quot;, which Taylor admired for having an experience that &quot;concentrated on action&quot; that players could jump into without first researching the gameplay details and settings. Taylor wanted to expand that concept into a streamlined, immersive, and action-heavy role-playing game that removed common elements of the genre that he found boring, frustrating, or slow. Taylor also wanted to make the gameplay itself simpler than contemporary role-playing games, so as to appeal to a wider audience. To that end, he asked Hallford to craft a narrative that was also fast and streamlined; he had him write a detailed backstory for the game, which would not be presented to players but would inform and inspire the developers, leaving the in-game text restrained to keep players engaged with the action. Hallford described the process of writing for the game as similar to other game projects, besides a greater emphasis on brevity, though he has said that he was brought onto the project much later than he usually is, which meant that he had to create a story that worked as a background to the set pieces that had already been developed. The plot of the game was intended by Taylor to be subordinate to the gameplay; to that end, he was unconcerned that his overall story arc was considered, even by the development team, to be somewhat of a cliché, as he felt that journeying to defeat an &quot;ultimate evil&quot; was very motivating to players. Taylor and Hallford discussed producing a &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; novel to explore Hallford&#x27;s story, though it never came to fruition.

Taylor wanted to further improve on the &quot;Diablo&quot; role-playing game formula by removing the concept of picking a character class at all and omitting &quot;Diablo&quot;″s long loading times. The development team also tried to make the game more streamlined by removing the need to backtrack to previously visited towns to sell items, by adding inventories to companion characters and pack mules. At one point in development, they planned to have a &quot;helper&quot; character who would pick up items dropped by enemies to let the player avoid doing so themselves. The developers also changed some elements that were standard in role-playing games that Taylor and the other developers found frustrating, such as letting players resell items to vendors for the same price that they were bought for instead of a steep discount, and &quot;sipping&quot; or only partially using potions instead of always using up the whole item.

Gas Powered Games included their game development tool, called the Siege Editor, as a tool for players to mod the game. Having seen the output of players creating mods for &quot;Total Annihilation&quot;, Taylor wanted to &quot;take that to the extreme&quot; and provide a full set of tools to foster a community of players enhancing and changing the game after release. He felt that the tools, which could allow players to make new game worlds, characters, and gameplay, would help support a large, long-term community of players around the game. Gas Powered Games hoped that providing what Daily Radar called &quot;one of the most comprehensive level toolsets we&#x27;ve ever seen&quot; would allow players to quickly and easily create small game regions, as well as allow more serious modders the ability to develop entire parallel games using the &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; game engine. They also hoped that this modding community would be able to enhance and extend the multiplayer gameplay beyond what they could release. Taylor attributed his enthusiasm for releasing their own development tools for modding to both his enjoyment of seeing mods for &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; produced years after its release as well as the lack of negative consequences to John Carmack and id Software&#x27;s historical tendency to release the entire source code to their games. Taylor later estimated that the company spent around twenty percent of their budget on developing the modding tools.

After the first year of development, Gas Powered Games found that they were not going to be able to finish the game within the planned two years; not only was the seamless world without loading screens harder to create than they had thought, but, according to lead developer Bartosz Kijanka, they had been overambitious in choosing how many innovative features they could put into the game&#x27;s custom engine, such as the wide range through which the virtual camera system could zoom in and out. Other features supported and later dropped included allowing up to ten characters at once—and therefore maintaining up to ten areas of the single-player world—instead of the final maximum of eight, and a weather system that included wind blowing projectiles off course. According to Kijanka, the developers also spent a lot of time changing technologies mid-development, such as building a custom animation editor before moving to a licensed one, and starting with the OpenGL graphics library only to switch to Direct3D. As a result, the team was required to work 12- to 14-hour days and weekends for most of the development time in order to complete the game within four years. In a 2011 interview, Taylor stated that in retrospect the final cost in development time of the seamless world may have been too high, and also that the team tried to make too large of a game for their budget; he believed that a game with closer to 35 hours of playtime instead of 70 would have been a better and more polished experience given their constraints.

By 2000, Gas Powered Games had begun to search for a publisher for the game. Taylor claims that multiple publishers were interested in the game, but he was convinced by Ed Fries to partner with the newly established Microsoft PC publishing group. Although Microsoft&#x27;s publishing wing was established in part to publish games for the newly announced Xbox console, Gas Powered Games and Microsoft did not strongly consider bringing the game to the console. Taylor believes that this was due to the size of the game itself, as well as the small market for role-playing games on consoles at the time. &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; was initially planned for release in the third quarter of 2001, before being delayed to the following year, and Gas Powered Games spent the added time tuning and polishing the game and expanding the game&#x27;s items and multiplayer features. &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; was released for Windows on April 5, 2002, by Microsoft. A version for Mac OS X on May 2, 2003, by developer Westlake Interactive and publisher Destineer.

==Reception==

&quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; was commercially successful, selling over 1.7 million copies. According to the NPD Group, preorders of the game in the month before its release made it the eighth-best selling computer game of March 2002, and upon release in the following month it rose to second-best selling, after &quot;The Sims: Vacation&quot;. It fell to seventh and then thirteenth place the following two months, and finished in 14th place for the year overall. By August 2006, it had sold 360,000 copies and earned $14.5 million in the United States alone. This led &quot;Edge&quot; to declare it the country&#x27;s 44th-best selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. By September 2002, &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; had also received a &quot;Gold&quot; certification from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

The game was highly rated by critics upon release; it is listed by review aggregator Metacritic as the third-highest rated computer role-playing game of 2002, behind &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; and &quot;The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&quot;, and the twenty-first-highest computer game overall for the year. The graphics were highly praised; Dan Adams of IGN called it &quot;ridiculously pretty to watch&quot;, while reviewers for GameSpot and &quot;GamePro&quot; praised the environments as being detailed and varied. Robert Coffey of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; and Greg Vederman of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; similarly lauded the detailed environments, while Andy McNamara and Kristian Brogger of &quot;Game Informer&quot; and GameSpy&#x27;s Peter Suciu called out the seamless world without loading screens as especially worthy of note. Suciu further praised how the freeform, seamless map was used to create areas that were not shaped like rectangular regions with a winding path filling up the space, as was typical with other role-playing games of the time. The IGN and &quot;GamePro&quot; reviewers commended the sound effects as excellent and for helping to create the atmosphere of the game, while the IGN and GameSpot reviewers also praised the &quot;ambient orchestral score&quot;.

The gameplay was similarly lauded; the &quot;GamePro&quot; review claimed that &quot;&quot;Dungeon Siege&quot;″s gameplay is perhaps its biggest and most transparent improvement over previous titles in the genre.&quot; Several reviewers compared it favorably to &quot;Diablo II&quot; (2000), then one of the most popular computer action role-playing games, with Adams of IGN claiming that it was very similar to &quot;Diablo II&quot; with some changes and improvements, and Coffey of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stating that the only thing keeping it from being directly rated as better was that the shift to a more tactical gameplay made it too different of a game to directly compare. &quot;PC Gamer&quot;″s Vederman, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Coffey, and the GameSpot reviewer praised the gameplay as being streamlined and accessible; they liked the tactical nature of controlling a party of adventurers who improved according to how they were used rather than directly controlling their actions and statistics. IGN&#x27;s Adams, however, said that the gameplay could get monotonous, Vederman of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; felt that the gameplay combat choices were somewhat limited, and GameSpy&#x27;s Suciu disliked the linearity of the single-player game. Adams further added that many of the tactical choices in the game were inconsequential, as all battles quickly devolved into brawls, and that the freeform system of leveling was essentially the same as four character classes as pursuing multiple tracks was ineffective.

The multiplayer content received mixed reviews: Adams praised the amount of additional content, while Suciu and the GameSpot reviewer noted that the multiplayer gameplay could easily become unbalanced between different players. The single-player plot was generally dismissed as inconsequential: the &quot;GamePro&quot; reviewer termed it &quot;skeletal&quot; and the &quot;Game Informer&quot; reviewers &quot;lackluster&quot;, and the GameSpot reviewer called it &quot;bland and forgettable&quot; and concluded that players who wanted a &quot;deeper role-playing game&quot; would be disappointed. Overall, Vederman of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; called &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; &quot;one of the best, most enjoyable games of the year&quot; and &quot;GamePro&quot;″s reviewer claimed it &quot;walks all over its competition with almost effortless grace&quot;, while Adams of IGN concluded that it was entertaining but had &quot;untapped potential&quot;.

==Legacy==
After it was showcased at E3 2000, &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; proceeded to win the Best RPG award from Game Revolution and Most Immersive Role-playing Game award from GameSpot. After release, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences (AIAS) nominated &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; for &quot;Computer Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Computer Gaming&quot; at the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards; it did not win either category, losing to &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; and &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot;, respectively. The game was also a nominee for &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s &quot;2002 Best Roleplaying Game&quot; award, but lost again to &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;. It did win the Best PC Game Graphics award from IGN.

Gas Powered Games&#x27; release of the Siege Editor did spark the rise of a modding community around the game; even before release several modding groups announced intentions to use the engine to create large-scale mods remaking games from the &quot;Ultima&quot; series of role playing games. After the game&#x27;s release, numerous mods were created, including several &quot;total conversion&quot; mods that made wholly new games and stories such as &quot;The Lands of Hyperborea&quot; and &quot;Elemental&quot;. Gas Powered Games released one mod of their own in July 2002 titled &quot;Yesterhaven&quot;, created by six designers over six weeks, which provided a short multiplayer storyline for low-level characters wherein they defended a town from three thematic plagues of monsters. It was followed up by &quot;Legends of Aranna&quot;, a full expansion pack developed by Mad Doc Software and released on November 11, 2003 for Windows and Mac OS X by Microsoft. The expansion pack added little new gameplay besides new terrains, creatures, and items, but featured an entirely separate story from the original game. In &quot;Legends&quot;, the player controls another unnamed farmer; after the Staff of Stars is stolen by a creature called the Shadowjumper, they set off to retrieve it. After fighting their way through monsters in icy hills, jungles, and islands, the player arrives at the mystical Great Clock, a giant artifact which controls Aranna&#x27;s seasons. There they defeat the Shadowjumper and retrieve the Staff of Stars. It received generally less positive reviews than the original, with critics praising the amount of content but criticizing the lack of changes to the base gameplay. At the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the AIAS nominated &quot;Legends of Aranna&quot; for &quot;Computer Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot;, though it lost to &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;.

Several other games have been released in the &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot; series, beginning with &quot;Dungeon Siege II&quot; (2005). That game received its own expansion pack, &quot;Dungeon Siege II: Broken World&quot; (2006), and was followed by a spinoff PlayStation Portable game titled &quot;Dungeon Siege: Throne of Agony&quot; (2006) and a third main title, &quot;Dungeon Siege III&quot; (2011). A movie directed by Uwe Boll and inspired by the original game, &quot;In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale&quot;, was released in theaters in 2007; it has been described as being &quot;loosely based&quot; on the game, and was a commercial and critical failure. It was followed by the home video sequels &quot;In the Name of the King 2: Two Worlds&quot; (2011) and &quot;In the Name of the King 3: The Last Mission&quot; (2014).

<text>In mathematical analysis, in particular the subfields of convex analysis and optimization, a proper convex function is an extended real-valued convex function with a non-empty domain, that never takes on the value formula_1 and also is not identically equal to formula_2 

In convex analysis and variational analysis, a point (in the domain) at which some given function formula_3 is minimized is typically sought, where formula_3 is valued in the extended real number line formula_5 Such a point, if it exists, is called a of the function and its value at this point is called the () of the function. If the function takes formula_1 as a value then formula_1 is necessarily the global minimum value and the minimization problem can be answered; this is ultimately the reason why the definition of &quot; requires that the function never take formula_1 as a value. Assuming this, if the function&#x27;s domain is empty or if the function is identically equal to formula_9 then the minimization problem once again has an immediate answer. Extended real-valued function for which the minimization problem is not solved by any one of these three trivial cases are exactly those that are called . Many (although not all) results whose hypotheses require that the function be proper add this requirement specifically to exclude these trivial cases. 

If the problem is instead a maximization problem (which would be clearly indicated, such as by the function being concave rather than convex) then the definition of &quot; is defined in an analogous (albeit technically different) manner but with the same goal: to exclude cases where the maximization problem can be answered immediately. Specifically, a concave function formula_10 is called if its negation formula_11 which is a convex function, is proper in the sense defined above. 

==Definitions==

Suppose that formula_12 is a function taking values in the extended real number line formula_5 
If formula_3 is a convex function or if a minimum point of formula_3 is being sought, then formula_3 is called if 

:formula_17 for formula_18 

and if there also exists point formula_19 such that

:formula_20

That is, a function is if it never attains the value formula_1 and its effective domain is nonempty. 
This means that there exists some formula_18 at which formula_23 and formula_3 is also equal to formula_25 Convex functions that are not proper are called convex functions. 

A is by definition, any function formula_26 such that formula_27 is a proper convex function. Explicitly, if formula_26 is a concave function or if a maximum point of formula_10 is being sought, then formula_10 is called if its domain is not empty, it takes on the value formula_31 and it is not identically equal to formula_25

==Properties==

For every proper convex function formula_33 there exist some formula_34 and formula_35 such that

:formula_36

for every formula_37 

The sum of two proper convex functions is convex, but not necessarily proper. For instance if the sets formula_38 and formula_39 are non-empty convex sets in the vector space formula_40 then the characteristic functions formula_41 and formula_42 are proper convex functions, but if formula_43 then formula_44 is identically equal to formula_2

The infimal convolution of two proper convex functions is convex but not necessarily proper convex.

<text>A wedding anniversary is the anniversary of the date that a wedding took place. Couples often mark the occasion by celebrating their relationship, either privately or with a larger party. Special celebrations and gifts are often given for particular anniversary milestones (e.g., 10, 15, 20, or 25 years). In some cultures, traditional names exist for milestone anniversaries; for instance, fifty years of marriage may be known variously as a &quot;golden wedding anniversary&quot;, &quot;golden anniversary&quot; or &quot;golden wedding&quot;.

==History, traditions and recognition==
Associating a wedding anniversary with precious metals such as &quot;gold&quot; (50 years) or &quot;silver&quot; (25 years) has been documented in Germanic countries since the 1500s. In English-speaking countries, the tradition of associating gift-giving with wedding anniversaries became more prevalent in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, increased commercialization led to the inclusion of more anniversaries to a list of predetermined gifts.

In some parts of the world, couples can receive special recognition from government officials for particular milestones. In the Commonwealth realms, a couple can receive a message from the monarch for 60th, 65th and 70th wedding anniversaries and for any wedding anniversary after that. This is done by applying to Buckingham Palace in the United Kingdom or to the governor-general&#x27;s office in the other Commonwealth realms.

In Australia, couples can receive a congratulatory letter from the governor-general on the 50th and all subsequent wedding anniversaries. The prime minister, the Leader of the Opposition, local members of both state and federal parliaments as well as state governors may also send salutations for the same anniversaries.

In Canada, couples can also receive a message from the governor-general for the 50th anniversary and every fifth anniversary after that.

In the United States, a couple can receive an anniversary greeting card from the president for the 50th and all subsequent anniversaries.

Catholics may apply for a papal blessing through their local diocese for wedding anniversaries of a special nature (25th, 50th, 60th, etc.).

==Commercial gifts==
Some significant anniversaries have names that suggest appropriate or traditional gifts, such as a silver or platinum jubilee. Gifts may be exchanged by spouses or given by guests at parties; they may also influence an anniversary party&#x27;s theme or decoration. These gifts vary in different countries, but some anniversary years now have well-established connections common to many nations; a popular analogy are the numerous jubilees thrown to celebrate anniversary milestones in the reigns of English and British monarchs, all of which are also associated with precious stones or metals.

* 25th anniversary: silver
* 40th anniversary: ruby
* 50th anniversary: gold 
* 60th anniversary: diamond 
* 70th anniversary: platinum

In English-speaking countries, the fifth-year gift (wood) was cut on the day of celebration and then presented to the wife as a finished item before the next two quarter days had passed.

In 1937, the American National Retail Jeweler Association (now known as Jewelers of America as a result of an organizational merger) introduced an expanded list of gifts. The revamped list gave a gift for each year up to the 25th and then for every fifth anniversary after that.

In South India, 60th and 80th wedding anniversaries are accompanied by large celebrations similar to weddings. In Tamil Nadu, there is a famous Thirukadaiyur Temple where special pujas are conducted for wedding anniversaries.

<doc id="630365" wikidata="Q1535037" url="?curid=630365" title="Golden Quadrilateral">
<text>The Golden Quadrilateral (; abbreviated GQ) is a national highway network connecting several major industrial, agricultural and cultural centres of India. It forms a quadrilateral with four major metro cities of India forming the vertices, viz., Delhi (north), Kolkata (east), Mumbai (west) and Chennai (south). Other major cities connected by this network include Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Vellore, Balasore, Bhadrak, Bhubaneswar, Bhilwara, Cuttack, Berhampur, Durgapur, Faridabad, Guntur, Gurugram, Jaipur, Kanpur, Pune, Kolhapur, Surat, Vijayawada, Eluru, Ajmer, Visakhapatnam, Bodhgaya, Varanasi, Prayagraj, Agra, Mathura, Dhanbad, Gandhinagar, Udaipur, and Vadodara. The main objective of these super highways is to reduce the travel time between the major cities of India, running roughly along the perimeter of the country. The North–South corridor linking Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir) and Kanyakumari (Tamil Nadu), and East–West corridor linking Silchar (Assam) and Porbandar (Gujarat) are additional projects. These highway projects are implemented by the National Highway Authority Of India (NHAI). At , it is the largest highway project in India and the fifth longest in the world. It is the first phase of the National Highways Development Project (NHDP), and consists of two, four, and six-lane express highways, built at a cost of . The project was planned in 1999, launched in 2001, and was completed on 7 January 2012.

The Golden Quadrilateral project is managed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) under the Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways. The vast majority of the system is not access controlled, although safety features such as guardrails, shoulders, and high-visibility signs are in use. The Mumbai–Pune Expressway, the first controlled-access toll road to be built in India, is a part of the GQ Project but not funded by NHAI, and is separate from the old Mumbai–Pune section of National Highway 48 (India). Infrastructure Leasing &amp; Financial Services (IL&amp;FS) has been one of the major contributors to the infrastructural development activity in the GQ project.

== History and costs ==

The Golden Quadrilateral Project (GQ Project) was intended to establish faster transport networks between major cities and ports, provide smaller towns better access to markets, reduce agricultural spoilage in transport, drive economical growth, and promote truck transport.

Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee laid the foundation stone for the project on 6 January 1999. It was planned to be completed by 2006, but there were delays due to land acquisition constraints and disputes with contractors which had to be renegotiated. In January 2012, India announced the four-lane GQ highway network as complete. 

India&#x27;s government had initially estimated that the Golden Quadrilateral project would cost at 1999 prices. However, the highway was built under-budget. As of August 2011, the cost incurred by the Indian government was about half of the initial estimate, at . The eight contracts in progress, as of August 2011, were worth .

In September 2009, it was announced that the existing four-laned highways would be converted into six-lane highways. Sections of NH 2, NH 4, NH 5 and NH 8 were prioritized for widening to six lanes under DBFO (Design, Build, Finance, Operate) pattern and more sections would be six-laned in the future. On NH 8, six-lane work was completed from Vadodara to Surat.

== Route ==

Only National Highways are used in the Golden Quadrilateral. The four legs use the following National Highways (new numbering system):

* Delhi – Kolkata: NH 44 from Delhi to Agra &amp; NH 19 from Agra to Kolkata
* Delhi – Mumbai – Chennai: NH 48
* Kolkata – Chennai: NH 16

== Connected cities ==

== Length in each state ==

The completed Golden Quadrilateral passes through 12 states and a union territory:

* Andhra Pradesh – 
* Uttar Pradesh – 
* Rajasthan – 
* Karnataka – 
* Maharashtra – 
* Gujarat – 
* Odisha – 
* West Bengal – 
* Tamil Nadu – 
* Bihar – 
* Jharkhand – 
* Haryana – 
* Delhi – 
* Total – 

== Corruption allegations ==
In August 2003, Jharkhand-based project director Satyendra Dubey, in a letter to the prime minister, outlined a list of bad faith (&quot;mala fide&quot;) actions in a segment of a highway in Bihar. Dubey&#x27;s claims included that big contractors had inside information from NHAI officials, that the contractors for this stretch were not executing the project themselves (as stipulated in the contract) but had been subcontracting the work to small builders who lacked technical expertise, and that no follow-up was performed after awarding advances. Dubey&#x27;s name was leaked by the prime minister&#x27;s office to the NHAI, and he was transferred against his wishes to Gaya, Bihar, where he was murdered on 27 November.

The NHAI eventually admitted that Dubey&#x27;s allegations were substantiated, and implemented &quot;radical reforms&quot; in the selection and contract procedures. After considerable Central Bureau of Investigation scrutiny, Mantu Kumar and three accomplices were arrested and charged with murder. Mantu escaped from court on 19 September 2005, but was recaptured a month later. In 2010, Mantu and two others were convicted of murder and other offenses and sentenced to life in prison.

<doc id="630369" wikidata="Q1060181" url="?curid=630369" title="Chalmers Johnson">
<text>Chalmers Ashby Johnson (August 6, 1931 – November 20, 2010) was an American political scientist specializing in comparative politics, and professor emeritus of the University of California, San Diego. He served in the Korean War, was a consultant for the CIA from 1967 to 1973 and chaired the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of California, Berkeley from 1967 to 1972. He was also president and co-founder with Steven Clemons of the Japan Policy Research Institute (now based at the University of San Francisco), an organization that promotes public education about Japan and Asia.

Johnson wrote numerous books, including three examinations of the consequences of what he called the &quot;American Empire&quot;: &quot;Blowback&quot;, &quot;The Sorrows of Empire&quot;, and &quot;Nemesis; The Last Days of the American Republic&quot;. A former Cold Warrior, he notably stated, &quot;A nation can be one or the other, a democracy or an imperialist, but it can&#x27;t be both. If it sticks to imperialism, it will, like the old Roman Republic, on which so much of our system was modeled, lose its democracy to a domestic dictatorship.&quot;

==Life and career==
Johnson was born in 1931 in Phoenix, Arizona, to David Frederick Johnson Jr. and Katherine Marjorie (Ashby) Johnson. He earned a BA in economics in 1953 and an MA and a PhD in political science in 1957 and 1961, respectively. Both of his advanced degrees were from the University of California, Berkeley. Johnson met his wife, Sheila, a junior at Berkeley, in 1956, and they married in Reno, Nevada, in May 1957.

During the Korean War, Johnson served as a naval officer in Japan. He was a communications officer on the USS &quot;La Moure County&quot;, which ferried Chinese prisoners of war from South Korea back to ports in North Korea. He taught political science at the University of California from 1962 until he retired from teaching in 1992. He was best known early in his career for his scholarship on the subjects of China and Japan.

Johnson set the agenda for 10 or 15 years in social science scholarship on China, with his book on peasant nationalism. His book &quot;MITI and the Japanese Miracle&quot;, on the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, was the pre-eminent study of the country&#x27;s development and it created the subfield of what could be called the political economy of development. He coined the term &quot;developmental state.&quot; As a public intellectual, he first led the &quot;Japan revisionists&quot; who critiqued American neoliberal economics with Japan as a model, and their arguments faded from view as the Japanese economy stagnated in the mid-1990s and later. During that period, Johnson served as a consultant to the Office of National Estimates, part of the CIA, and contributed to analysis of China and Maoism.

Johnson was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1976. He served as Director of the Center for Chinese Studies (1967–1972) and Chair of the Political Science Department at Berkeley, and he held a number of important academic posts in area studies. He was a strong believer in the importance of language and historical training for conducting serious research. Late in his career, he became well known as a critic of rational choice approaches, particularly in the study of Japanese politics and political economy.

Johnson is probably best known as a sharp critic of what he called “American imperialism.” His book &quot;Blowback&quot; (2000) won a prize in 2001 from the Before Columbus Foundation, and it was reissued in an updated version in 2004. &quot;Sorrows of Empire&quot;, published in 2004, updated the evidence and argument from &quot;Blowback&quot; for the post-9/11 environment, and &quot;Nemesis&quot; concludes the trilogy. Johnson was featured as an expert talking head in the Eugene Jarecki-directed film &quot;Why We Fight&quot;, which won the 2005 Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.

Johnson wrote for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;The Nation&quot;.

==Blowback series==
Johnson believed that the enforcement of American hegemony over the world constitutes a new form of global empire. Whereas traditional empires maintained control over subject peoples via colonies, the US, since World War II, has developed a vast system of hundreds of military bases around the world. A longtime Cold Warrior, he applauded the dissolution of the Soviet Union: &quot;I was a cold warrior. There&#x27;s no doubt about that. I believed the Soviet Union was a genuine menace. I still think so.&quot; At the same time, however, he experienced a political awakening after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and noted that instead of demobilizing its armed forces, the US accelerated its reliance on military solutions to problems both economic and political. The result of that militarism, as distinct from domestic defense, is more terrorism against the US and its allies, the loss of core democratic values at home, and the eventual crumbling of the American economy. Of four books he wrote on the topic, the first three are referred to as the Blowback Trilogy. Johnson summarized the intent of the Blowback series in the final chapter of &quot;Nemesis&quot;.

===&quot;Blowback: The Costs and Consequences of American Empire&quot;===
===&quot;The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic&quot;===
===&quot;Nemesis: The Last Days of the American Republic&quot;===
===&quot;Dismantling the Empire: America&#x27;s Last Best Hope&quot;===
Johnson outlines how the United States can reverse American hegemony and preserve the American state. &quot;Dismantling the Empire&quot; is suggested reading for CIA personnel.

=== &quot;Evil Empire&quot;===
In a 2007, during the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars, Johnson gave a series of lectures titled, &quot;Evil Empire&quot;, as part of his American Empire Project, in which he summed up his trilogy, &quot;Blowback: The Costs and Consequences of American Empire&quot;, &quot;The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic&quot;, and &quot;Nemesis:The Last Days of the American Republic&quot; in speeches titled &quot;Evil Empire&quot;. The books and lectures are a warning about the unintended consequences of US policy in the world. In June 2007, he gave a talk at a local Democratic Club in Fallbrook, CA which was filmed and released on DVD. It is produced and directed by Jon Monday for mondayMEDIA.

Synopsis: Johnson traces the fall of the Roman Empire as a pattern he saw in American geopolitics. The term blowback is used by the CIA to mean the unintended consequences of American policies and actions in the world. His book &quot;Blowback&quot;, which was first published in January 2001, predicted the events of 9/11 as being the result of American policy. He cites the combination of militarism, far-flung military bases around the world, unsustainable economic domestic policy, and a complacent voting population as being toxic to American democracy.

The extras in the DVD include a Q&amp;A session with Johnson, and interview with Representative Bob Filner, and comments by Midge Costanza, who was an advisor to President Carter. The main talk is now available on YouTube.

<text>Departmentalization (or departmentalisation) refers to the process of grouping activities into departments. Division of labour creates specialists who need coordination. This coordination is facilitated by grouping specialists together in departments.

==Popular types of departmentalization==
* Functional departmentalization - Grouping activities by functions performed. Activities can be grouped according to function (work being done) to pursue economies of scale by placing employees with shared skills and knowledge into departments for example human resources, IT, accounting, manufacturing, logistics, and engineering. Functional departmentalization can be used in all types of organizations. Group activities in accordance with the function of an enterprise.
* Product departmentalization - Grouping activities by product line. It can also be grouped according to a specific product or service, thus placing all activities related to the product or the service under one manager. Each major product area in the corporation is under the authority of a senior manager who is specialist in, and is responsible for, everything related to the product line. LA Gear is an example of company that uses product departmentalization. Its structure is based on its varied product lines which include women’s footwear etc.
* Customer departmentalization - Grouping activities on the basis of common customers or types of customers. Jobs may be grouped according to the type of customer served by the organization. The assumption is that customers in each department have a common set of problems and needs that can best be met by specialists. The sales activities in an office supply firm can be broken down into three departments that serve retail, wholesale and government accounts.
* Geographic departmentalization - Grouping activities on the basis of territory. If an organization&#x27;s customers are geographically dispersed, it can group jobs based on geography. For example, the organization structure of Coca-Cola has reflected the company’s operation in two broad geographic areas – the North American sector and the international sector, which includes the Pacific Rim, the European Community, Northeast Europe, Africa and Latin America groups.
* Process departmentalization - Grouping activities on the basis of product or service or customer flow. Because each process requires different skills, process departmentalization allows homogeneous activities to be grouped together. For example, applicants might need to go through several departments, namely validation, licensing and treasury, before receiving a driver’s license.
* Divisional departmentalization - When the firm develops independent lines of business that operate as separate companies, all contributing to the corporation profitability, the design is called divisional departmentalization or (M-FORM). For example, the Limited. Inc., has these divisions: The Limited, Express, Lerner New York, Lane Bryant and Mast Industries.

Owing to the complexity of tasks and the competitive environment in which organisations operate, they often use a combination of the above-mentioned methods in departmentalization.

==Some philosophical considerations==
As March and Simon (1958) noted when tracing a first approach to departmentalization back to Aristotle (Politics, Book IV, Chap. 15), the problem of distributing work, authority and responsibility throughout an organization is hardly new. In modern times, Gulick and Urwick (1937) were the first to introduce a theory of different departmentalization strategies, which were referred to as &quot;departmentalization by purpose&quot; and &quot;departmentalization by process&quot;.

”First [organization by major process] ... by bringing together in a single office a large amount of each kind of work (technologically measured), makes it possible in the most effective divisions of work and specialization. Second, it makes possible also the economies of the maximum use of labor saving machinery and mass production.
... there is danger that an organization erected on the basis of purpose will fail to make use of the most up-to-date technical devices and specialists because ... there may not be enough work of a given technical sort to permit efficient subdivision.
Is there any advantage in placing specialized services like private secretaries or filing in [process departments]? In a very small organization, yes; in a large organization, no. In a small organization, where there is not a full-time job on some days for a secretary, it is better to have a central secretarial pool than to have a private secretary for each man. In a large organization, the reverse is true.” (Gulick &amp; Urwick, 1937)
Studying the above characterizations of the two forms of departmentalization, purpose decentralization is concerned with building work around specific products, customers, or geographic locations, while process departmentalization encompasses the efficiency of ”production”. March and Simon (1958) described the basic difference between the two ways of departmentalization as following:

”Process departmentalization generally takes greater advantage of the potentialities for economy of specialization than does purpose departmentalization: purpose departmentalization leads to greater self-containment and lower coordination costs than process departmentalization.”
When taking a closer look at the three ways of departmentalization by purpose–product, customer, and location, there are some specific advantages related to it.

First, self-containment tends to improve the ability for internal coordination within the unit. At the same time, the need for developing and maintaining extensive external coordination mechanisms is reduced.

Second, a clearer focus on the purpose itself–serving a specific customer or market–is enabled. On the other hand, the sense of independence may result in a drift-off from the achievement of the overall objectives of the organization. Therefore, several authors have emphasized the need for establishing control systems that serve the purpose of allowing decentralized decisions, while still aligning all sub-units to the overall goals of the organization (Drucker 1954, Koontz &amp; O’Donnell, 1964).

Departmentalization by process, on the other hand, seeks to benefit from the advantages that are found in high specialization, and tends to be very efficient in some instances. A high degree of specialization leads to the development of proficiency and professional competence, as well as it enables, and implies, the development of centralized control functions.

On the other hand, the problem of aligning individual and organizational goals remains. In addition, in this case, we would also need to consider departmental goals. Also, the high level of specialization is a barrier for the flexible reallocation of resources within the organization, i.e. people can not perform other tasks than those they are working with in their functional occupation. The most common way of process departmentalization is the division of the firm into business functions, such as purchasing, manufacturing, sales, accounting, etc.

Looking at the circumstances encompassing the use of either of the departmentalization strategies, we find that departmentalization by process generally is advantageous in cases of stable environments, while departmentalization by purpose, featuring self-containment and certain amounts of independence, appears to be the appropriate strategy for handling changing or unpredictable circumstances. Alfred Chandler (in: March and Simon, 1958) identified a correlation between the application of purpose departmentalization and the use of a diversification strategy:
”The dominant centralized structure had one basic weakness. A very few men were still entrusted with a great number of complex decisions. ... As long as an enterprise belonged in an industry whose market, sources of raw materials, and production processes remained relatively unchanged, few entrepreneurial decisions have to be reached. In that situation, such a weakness was not critical, but where technology, market, and sources of supplies were changed rapidly, the defect of such a structure became more obvious.”
==Recent trends in departmentalization==
* The customer departmentalization has become increasingly emphasized.
* Rigid departmentalization is being complemented by the use of teams that cross over traditional departmental lines (&quot;silos&quot;).
