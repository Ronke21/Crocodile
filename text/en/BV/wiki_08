<text>West Hills is a neighborhood in the western San Fernando Valley region of the city of Los Angeles, California. It is bordered by mountain ranges to the west and the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Chatsworth to the north, Canoga Park to the east, and Woodland Hills to the south.

The neighborhood was formerly the home of many Native American tribes, and during the early Spanish and Mexican era was part of the Mission San Fernando Rey de España. In the American era, West Hills was part of Owensmouth, which was renamed Canoga Park in 1930. West Hills was established in western Canoga Park and retained its present name in 1987.

Several city parks are to be found within the community. The area is highly residential; there are some religious establishments and a few commercial areas in the community. Two private high schools are among the 13 schools within West Hills.

==Geography==
===Location===
West Hills (formerly joined with Canoga Park) is located in the western San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County and about 45 minutes (depending on traffic) from downtown Los Angeles. It is off of U.S. 101 (the Ventura Freeway) via the Valley Circle Boulevard/Mullholland Highway off-ramp.

====Mapping L.A.====
According to the 2008 Mapping L.A. project of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, West Hills is flanked on the north by the Chatsworth Reservoir, on the east by Canoga Park, on the south by Woodland Hills, on the southwest by Hidden Hills and on the west by Bell Canyon in Ventura County.

====Neighborhood Council boundaries====
In 1987, Los Angeles recognized the following description of the boundaries of West Hills Neighborhood Council:

Starting at the centerline intersections of Topanga Canyon Boulevard and Nordhoff Street, westward down the centerline of Nordhoff extended in a straight line to the city limits of the City of Los Angeles; thence southward, following the border of the City of Los Angeles to the centerline of Victory Boulevard; thence eastward down the centerline of Victory Boulevard to Shoup Avenue centerline; thence northward down the centerline of Shoup Avenue to the intersection of the centerline of Roscoe Boulevard; thence eastward down the centerline of Roscoe Boulevard to the centerline of Topanga Canyon Boulevard; then northward down the centerline of Topanga Canyon Boulevard to the centerline of Nordhoff Street.

===Water resources===
Bell and Dayton creeks in West Hills are several of the headwaters of the Los Angeles River that originate in the Northwest San Fernando Valley. The Los Angeles River itself begins at the confluence of Arroyo Calabasas (Calabasas Creek) and Bell Creek in Canoga Park. These and other small creeks supply stormwater and suburban runoff water to the Los Angeles River, and several are considered year-round creeks. Although the creeks are now channeled and run within concrete walls, they do form a significant urban wildlife landscape and contribute to the population of indigenous wildlife left within the San Fernando Valley.

Both Bell Creek and Dayton Creek in particular have received attention due to their headwaters origins inside the Santa Susana Field Laboratory in the Simi Hills. The SSFL is mandated for an environmental cleanup due to its uses as a testing center for rocket and missile engines, nuclear reactor research and fuel reprocessing, and high technology defense systems. It was also the site of a partial nuclear core meltdown in 1959. Prominent contaminants include radionuclides, VOCs-volatile organic compounds, Chromium, Lead, Benzene, and other components of rocket engine fuel and cleaning compounds.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm and dry summers, with average temperatures peaking at highs throughout August. West Hills has a climate similar to other locations in the west San Fernando Valley, such as nearby Woodland Hills with a long-established weather station at Pierce College. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, West Hills has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csa&quot; on climate maps.

==History==
===Pre-Spanish contact history===
The present day West Hills area was the homeland of Native Americans in the Tongva-Fernandeño and Chumash-Venturaño tribes, that lived in the Simi Hills and close to Bell Creek and other local tributaries to the Los Angeles River. Native American civilizations had inhabited the San Fernando Valley for an estimated 8,000 years. The village, Hu&#x27;wam, of the Chumash-Venturaños, was located at the base of Escorpión Peak (Castle Peak) near present-day Bell Canyon Park. It was a meeting and trading point for them with the Tongva-Fernandeño and Tataviam-Fernandeño people. A cave near Hu&#x27;wam, known as the Cave of Munits, is the believed home of a mythical Chumash shaman named Munits, who was killed by an eagle after murdering the son of a Chumash chief. Escorpión Peak is one of nine alignment points in the ancestral Chumash homelands, believed essential to maintaining the balance of the natural world.

===Spanish and Mexican history===
From 1797 to 1846, the area (future West Hills) was part of Mission San Fernando Rey de España (Mission San Fernando). After Mexico won independence from Spain, it later became part of Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando in Alta California. In 1845, a separate land grant for Rancho El Escorpión was issued by Governor Pío Pico to three Chumash people: Odón Eusebia, Urbano, and Urbano&#x27;s son Mañuel. It encompassed the land west of present-day Woodlake Avenue in West Hills, with its adobe ranch buildings (present 1840s—1960s) sited beside Bell Creek near present-day Bell Canyon Park.

===American history===
====Land grants====
California was admitted to the United States in 1850, with Spanish and Mexican land grants requiring a federal land patent to retain ownership. The United States Public Land Commission patented the Rancho to original grantees Odón Eusebia, Urbano, and Mañuel in 1876. In 1912 the Chumash heirs sold Rancho El Escorpión to George Platt. He established a dairy operation on renamed Platt Ranch variously called Ferndale, &quot;escorpion,&quot; or Cloverdale Dairy. The Rancho El Escorpión-Platt Ranch was not incorporated into Los Angeles and its water system until 1958 and was left undeveloped until 1961.

====Separation from Canoga Park====
West Hills was originally part of Owensmouth (founded 1912) and renamed Canoga Park (1931).

Under the leadership of Joel Schiffman, residents of a three-square-mile area in western Canoga Park began a petition campaign in 1987 to separate from the larger community and establish a neighborhood of their own to be called West Hills, the same name that a 303-home subdivision in a nearby unincorporated area had carried for years. The Los Angeles city district of 4,700 single-family homes and 35 businesses would be bounded by Roscoe Boulevard on the north, Woodlake Avenue, Sherman Way and Platt Avenue on the east, Victory Boulevard on the south and the county line on the west. Proponents said the change would give the area &quot;political clout&quot; and increase property values. The drive, which was opposed by the Canoga Park Chamber of Commerce, was partially financed by a real estate firm, whose owner, Lynn Garvanian, said the name change would &quot;add 5% to the value of homes.&quot; The campaign was quickly criticized as &quot;snobby and greedy&quot; by members of the Canoga Park Chamber of Commerce but defended by supporters who said it would allow the neighborhood to preserve its residential character. Petition leaders said they hoped a new name would separate the more affluent West Hills area from Canoga Park&#x27;s &quot;fading factories, aging subdivisions and X-rated bars and theaters.&quot;

As the petition drive expanded to include three more areas—two on the edge of the Chatsworth Reservoir and one on the western edge of Canoga Park—the Canoga Park Chamber of Commerce took an official stand against the separation, with president William Vietinghoff calling it &quot;a source of division and disharmony ... an extremely dangerous precedent for the whole San Fernando Valley.&quot; Council member Hal Bernson, however, said he did not &quot;look at it as a slam against Canoga Park—just as a group of people wanting identity.&quot;

On January 16, 1987, Councilwoman Joy Picus accepted petitions representing 3,364, or 77% of the 4,333 households in the area within her councilmanic district, and she immediately said she would direct the city&#x27;s transportation department to put up boundary signs as the residents requested. Many of the latter expected the name change to add thousands of dollars of value to their properties. Two weeks later Picus added another two-mile-wide section of Canoga Park that gave West Hills the Fallbrook Mall and Platt Village shopping centers, along with several smaller retail strips and some older residential tracts built in flatland areas. This addition was denounced by Schiffman, who said it did &quot;a lot to erode the community identity we sought.&quot;

In what was called a &quot;stampede,&quot; other areas sought entry into West Hills, one homeowner on Santa Susana Place saying residents there wanted to &quot;divorce ourselves from Canoga Park&#x27;s element.&quot; Council member Hal Bernson agreed to add a square-mile area with 423 households bounded by Roscoe Boulevard on the south, Parthenia Street on the north, Shoup Avenue on the west and Topanga Canyon Boulevard on the east, although the commercial northwest corner of Roscoe and Topanga Canyon boulevards was to remain in Canoga Park. Those additions meant that from nearly a third to nearly half of the former Canoga Park was to be part of the new West Hills.

Still, a demand continued for admittance to West Hills. A community meeting scheduled for August 31, 1987, had to be repeated later the same evening when some four hundred people packed a meeting room at the Fallbrook Mall to wrestle with the decision on where the final boundary should be. The later event drew three hundred. A poll was taken among about 8,500 residents in an area between Topanga Canyon Boulevard and the recently adopted West Hills border at Woodlake and Platt avenues to choose an eastern border. More than a hundred protestors gathered in front of Picus&#x27;s office to protest any enlargement of West Hills, chanting &quot;Hell, no, we won&#x27;t grow!&quot; But other residents wound through the area in car caravans, shouting from megaphones and waving signs urging &quot;Vote to Fallbrook.&quot; In the end, Picus made a controversial decision to move the eastern boundary of West Hills from Platt and Woodlake avenues to Shoup Avenue, a decision that did not please everybody.

In 1994, the Canoga Park and West Hills communities achieved a &quot;partial rapprochement&quot; when business leaders voted to form a united Canoga Park/West Hills Chamber of Commerce, which is still in existence.

==Parks and landmarks==
Three ranches and a silent film star&#x27;s estate in West Hills have been awarded Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument status recognition and protection, and two are city parks. In addition, on the western edge of West Hills huge open space preserves provide an undeveloped greenbelt and nearby recreation opportunities. The high number of neighborhood parks here offer sports fields and courts, play areas for children, and community rooms.

===Landmarks===
====Orcutt Ranch====
* Orcutt Ranch Estate, (&quot;Rancho Sombra del Roble&quot;) to the Orcutts, is the 1920 adobe residence, gardens, and citrus orchards of William Warren Orcutt, an early Union Oil Company executive. The park has an entry through craftsman style stone gates to a parking area with natural habitat landscaping on Roscoe Boulevard near Valley Circle Boulevard. The park, now named the Orcutt Ranch Horticulture Center, offers: self-guided strolling, exploring and scheduled house tours; public community gardens; annual public citrus harvests; and garden wedding and special event facilities. Orcutt Ranch is a registered-protected Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.

====Shadow Ranch====
* Shadow Ranch Park, formerly the Workman Ranch, on Vanowen Street just east of Fallbrook Avenue. Alfred Workman was a muleskinner who emigrated from Australia, winding up running a massive wheat farm owned by a syndicate led by Isaac Lankershim and Isaac Van Nuys. He bought the ranch in 1869, and from then to 1872, Workman built a home for his wife, Henrietta Feliz, and himself by adding onto an existing adobe. The Australian had eucalyptus trees imported and planted on the ranch, and some folks claim all the eucalyptus trees in California stem from Workman Ranch. Workman Ranch was acquired by a married, screenwriting couple, Colin Clements and Florence Ryerson (the latter co-wrote the screenplay for The Wizard of Oz while living here). She renamed the estate Shadow Ranch for the amount of shade provided by the numerous eucalyptus trees planted by Workman decades ago. William Wyler&#x27;s movie &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;, based on the play by Lillian Hellman, was filmed here in 1961. Shadow Ranch Park is an L.A. City Park with lighted basketball courts, a children&#x27;s play area, football and soccer fields, meeting and community rooms, a baseball diamond, and picnic tables. Organized youth sports are also offered at this registered-protected Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument

===Open-space parks===
All of these large Parks are open for walks, hiking, mountain biking, and equestrian riding; sunrise to sunset.

* El Escorpión Park: The area landmark El Escorpión Peak centered in the park offers hikes with impressive views of the Valley. The trailhead and parking are at the western end of Vanowen Boulevard, west of Valley Circle Boulevard (Castle Peak Park).
* Bell Canyon Park is directly adjacent on the northwest of El Escorpión Park, with trails along natural Bell Creek and up the north side of the Peak. The trailheads and parking are off Bell Canyon Boulevard just before the &#x27;Bell Canyon community&#x27; gatehouse, west of Valley Circle Boulevard. Pedestrian access follows up the creek past the gated road to later loop around the Peak to El Escorpión Park.
* Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve parking and trailheads are at the western end of Victory Boulevard, west of Valley Circle Boulevard. Trails cross the huge natural park and connect west to adjoining Cheseboro-Palo Comado Canyon Park section of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, north to El Escorpión and Bell Canyon Parks, and south to Hidden Hills, creating a generous greenbelt for West Hills. There are also scheduled evening moonlight hikes, and daytime events.
* Roscoe/Valley Circle Park is a rustic linear open space park with panoramic views and an equestrian trail, west of Valley Circle Boulevard, with access at Roscoe Boulevard, at West Stagg Street, and at Quiet Hills Court.

===Neighborhood parks===
* Knapp Ranch Park has two sections: Kittridge Avenue east section offers these outdoor unlighted sports facilities: baseball diamond, basketball courts, a children&#x27;s play area, picnic tables, and tennis courts; Wooded Vista and Twisted Oak Drive west section offers walks, a picnic area, and panoramic views.

* Four Oaks Park is a neighborhood pocket park, with a children&#x27;s play area and picnic tables, on Cohasset and Melba Ave.

===Other historic-cultural landmarks===
====Francis Lederer Estate====
The Lederer Estate, which was owned by stage actor and early film star Francis Lederer (1899–2000), has two separate structures and their settings that are each a registered Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument—LAHCM. These are: the former residence and its outdoor patio rooms, gardens, and grounds; and the equestrian stables and its patios. Lederer was the honorary Mayor of Canoga Park (pre-West Hills) for many years. In retirement he taught theatre classes, and was a member of the L.A. City Parks Board of Directors. The landmark buildings are located west of and near the West Hills Post Office and West Hills Hospital.

* Francis Lederer Residence: LAHCM No. 204, a very distinguished residential example of the Mediterranean Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival, and Mission Revival styles of architecture integrated together, with the interior and exterior design and artisan detailing of museum quality. The house was begun in 1934 and constructed over a period of years, with artisan builder John R. Litke, by Lederer on his then 300-acre Canoga Park ranch. It sits atop a hill overlooking the Valley and surrounding mountains.The exterior walls use stone quarried from the site. The residence wraps around a large central courtyard with a fountain and outdoor fireplace, and the various rooms opening onto it. The materials were chosen with care and painstakingly employed in such a manner as to make the resulting structure appear very old. The imported Spanish and Italian furnishings and artworks are of particular interest, dating from the 14th to 19th centuries. The estate&#x27;s residence was to become a public museum housing the Canoga-Owensmouth Historical Society, a community arts center, and its gardens and open space a city park; however it is currently for sale by the heirs (2013).
* Francis Lederer Stables: LAHCM No. 135, designed and built in a rustic and authentic Mission Revival architectural style. It was also designed by Francis Lederer and John R. Litke in 1936 and used locally quarried stones. It was originally on the natural bank of free-flowing Bell Creek, before its channelization in the late 1950s. Through Mrs. Lederer&#x27;s efforts in the 1970s, the stables opened to the community as the Canoga Mission Gallery—now the Hidden Chateau event venue, on western Sherman Way.

====Peppergate Ranch====
The Peppergate Ranch was located between Orcutt Ranch and Chatsworth Reservoir. The ranch&#x27;s residence was designed by master architect Paul R. Williams (1894–1980) in the Ranch Style. It was built in 1939 for Talton R. Craig, founder of the Craig Movie Supply Company. The T.R. Craig Residence is a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument (#992; in 2011), located on Pinelake Drive. Peppergate Ranch was subdivided, as Woodlake Estates and Pinelake Estates, in the 1960s.

<text>Simon Vestdijk (; 17 October 1898 – 23 March 1971) was a Dutch writer.

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature fifteen times.

==Life==
Born in the small Frisian town of Harlingen, Vestdijk studied medicine in Amsterdam, but turned to literature after a few years as a doctor, including some time on board a ship. From 1932, he lived from literature. He became one of the most important 20th-century writers in the Netherlands. During the German occupation, he and other Dutch intellectuals were held hostage in Kamp Sint-Michielsgestel for some time, partly because they did not want to join the Chamber of Culture. After the war, he retired to Doorn (Utrecht province). 

Vestdijk struggled with severe depressions from his youth, and until the end of his life.

His prolificness as a novelist was legendary (poet Adriaan Roland Holst saying of him that &quot;he writes quicker than God can read&quot;), but he was at least as important as an essayist on e.g., literature, religion, art, and music in particular. He also wrote much poetry and short stories. His work has been translated into several European languages. Some of his novels appeared as films in the cinema, or were broadcast on television.

<doc id="611877" wikidata="Q5604476" url="?curid=611877" title="Greensborough, Victoria">
<text>Greensborough is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-east from Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Banyule and Shire of Nillumbik local government areas. Greensborough recorded a population of 21,070 at the 2021 census.

==Etymology==
The suburb was named after settler Edward Bernard Green, who was also the district mail contractor. Formerly it was known as Keelbundoora.

==History==
In 1838, Henry Smythe, a Crown grantee, purchased 259 hectares for £544, from John Alison. The boundaries of this land included Gold Street in the North, Macorna Street in the West, Grimshaw Street in the South and Plenty River in the East. In 1841 he sold this land for £1600 to Edward Bernard Green and it was from Green that Greensborough derived its name.

The township was established in the late 1850s, with the Post Office opening on 17 July 1858. In 1842, Charteris Lieutenant, Robert Whatmough started his own orchard. Whatmough&#x27;s knowledge of botany was extensive and had published a comprehensive book on Botany after arriving in Australia. Trees can still be found growing in Greensborough, along the Plenty River Trail. By 1871, Greensborough had a population of 167 and by 1933 had grown to 940.

In 1845 a small private school was established. The school was a slab hut with a large fireplace that filled the end wall. Mr. Purcell, the teacher charged two shillings, per week for each of his twenty pupils. The building was destroyed by fire and another school did not re-open until 1854. There is very little information about the school or the teaching methods of Mr. Purcell.

A telegraph line connecting Greensborough and Diamond Creek with Heidelberg was completed in 1888. From 27 July 1888 a telephone link across the line was added so that telegrams could be sent or received by telephone.

During the 1880s and 1890s Diamond Valley became popular with excursionists from inner Melbourne. Tourism increased with the advent of the railway line in the twentieth century. Greensborough was noted for its fishing (cod, perch, blackfish and eels). Another leisure pursuit that was taken up by visitors was shooting. Rabbit and hares were plentiful and the hotel provided accommodation for weekend visitors.

The Diamond Valley Football Association was formed 1922 at Diamond Creek and initially consisted of teams from Kangaroo Ground, Eltham, Diamond Creek, Templestowe, Greensborough, and Warrandyte.

=== Greensborough Hotel ===
In 1864, the Greensborough Hotel, formally known as the Farmers Arms Hotel, was built by Englishman James Iredale. It served as a stopping point for travellers on their way to the goldfields further north. By law, a lit lantern was required as a sign of welcome to those needing a well-earned rest or to refresh their horses. The hotel was demolished and rebuilt in 1925 by then-owner Denis Monahan. Greensborough Hotel, by architects Sydney Smith, Ogg and Serpell, 349 Collins Street, Melbourne, has been well thought out, and the three sources of income - the bar, the dining room and the residential section, although all under easy supervision from the office, are kept absolutely distinct, so that visitors to any of these three sections are separate. Greensborough Hotel is the second hotel to occupy this site and represents a continuation of use spanning close to 150 years. It is aesthetically significant as an unusual example of the inter-War Spanish Mission style hotel in the suburb of Greensborough. It is one of the few early twentieth-century buildings remaining in the area and has become a landmark in the commercial centre of Greensborough. The hotel is located on the corner of Main Street and The Circuit, Greensborough. The latest owner of the hotel is George Hamad.

There are 13 plaques installed from the corner of Grimshaw and Henry Street, down Grimshaw and left into Main Street featuring historical information.
==Geography==

Greensborough borders the beginning of the Green Wedge, an area of bush land that runs northward into Eltham and Diamond Creek. The Plenty River, a tributary of the Yarra River, runs through Greensborough, joining the Yarra at Templestowe.

==Government==
In 2017, Banyule City Council moved their main offices to Greensborough from Ivanhoe as part of the wider &quot;One Flintoff&quot; project which included new offices and community facilities that were built above WaterMarc. The civic centre includes three level offices to accommodate 320 Council staff, community and function rooms. The centre was designed by Peddle Thorp.

The Shire of Nillumbik also operates it offices located in Greensborough at the site of the former Diamond Valley offices, next to the Diamond Valley library.

==Amenities==


Greensborough&#x27;s main retail area is Main Street. Greensborough Plaza is a major regional shopping centre which services Melbourne&#x27;s north-eastern suburbs. It was built in 1976 and has since undergone numerous renovations from a small shopping centre into a multi-storey facility. The shopping centre&#x27;s major tenants include Coles, ALDI, Kmart, Target, Chemist Warehouse, JB Hi-Fi Home, The Reject Shop, Rebel Sport, Anytime Fitness and Hoyts Cinemas.

In 2009, the Greensborough Town Centre was set to receive a major upgrade although most of the improvements were delayed or cancelled due to the global financial crisis. Following this time, several new facilities were built, including a new aquatic centre, WaterMarc, a multi-level car park and Greensborough Walk, a new pedestrian promenade connecting Main Street with Watermarc. 

Diamond Valley Library, Civic Drive, Greensborough is operated by Yarra Plenty Regional Library.

The Greensborough Historical Society is a local history group which aims to collect, catalogue, preserve and share the history and heritage of Greensborough.

==Transport==
===Road===
Greensborough and the surrounding suburbs is serviced by a network of roads including the Greensborough Highway, which bypasses the town centre and connects to the Metropolitan Ring Road. The main street is Main Street which runs into Diamond Creek Road, while other main arterials include Para Road which runs south and Grimshaw Street which runs west.

===Rail===
Greensborough railway station services the central area of Greensborough. It is a staffed station on the Hurstbridge railway line with an island platform.

===Bus===
The suburb serves as a major hub for bus services for the surrounding area, with most services departing from the Main Street terminal. To this end, pedestrian links between the station and Main Street were due to be upgraded in between 2010 and 2015 as part of the Greensborough Project development to improve public transport connectivity. These links have not yet been re-proposed by either local, state or federal governments.

==Education==

The first government primary school opened in 1875. Greensborough College is a high school with approximately 518 students, located between Greensborough and Watsonia. Greensborough is also home to several primary schools including Greensborough Primary School, located next to Greensborough Plaza and established in 1878, St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, St Thomas the Apostle Catholic Primary School, Greenhills Primary School, Watsonia Heights Primary School and Apollo Parkways Primary School.

The Greensborough Melbourne Polytechnic campus reopened in 2017 aided by a $10 million state government investment after initially closing in 2013.

==Sport and recreation==

Greensborough Football Club plays in the Northern Football League. Diamond Valley United Soccer Club also play at Partington&#x27;s Flat and currently compete in Victorian State League Division 2.

Greensborough has a polyurethane athletic track at Willinda Park, which is the home of the Diamond Valley Little Athletics Centre, the largest Little Athletics Centre in Victoria with over 750 athletes, the Diamond Valley Athletic Club and the Ivanhoe Harriers.

The DVE Aquatic Club also operates out of Watermarc.

Greensborough is also home to multiple tennis clubs including; St Mary’s tennis club, which has two court locations and Greensborough tennis club. Both of which are located along the Plenty River. The Grace Valley Tennis Club was established in 1979 with en tout cas courts built in Central Park.

The Greensborough Bypass Trail is a shared use path for cyclists and pedestrians. It starts at Grimshaw Street.

==Parks, gardens and reserves==
Andrew Yandell Reserve, Greensborough is located at 37 St. Helena Road, Greensborough, Victoria. The site occupies over six hectares of indigenous bushland maintained by the City of Banyule. The Yandell Habitat Reserve is of local historic, scientific, social, and aesthetic significance to the City of Banyule.

Willinda Park is located at the end of Nell Street, near the Plenty River Trail.

<doc id="611881" wikidata="Q1594002" url="?curid=611881" title="Heidelberg, Victoria">
<text>Heidelberg () is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, northeast of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the City of Banyule local government area. Heidelberg recorded a population of 7,360 at the 2021 census.

Once a large town on Melbourne&#x27;s outskirts, Heidelberg was absorbed into Melbourne as part of the latter&#x27;s northward expansion after World War II. Heidelberg once had its own historic central business district including its own municipality in the former City of Heidelberg.

Heidelberg lends its name to the Heidelberg School, an impressionist art movement that developed in and around the town in the late 19th-century.

==History==

The land at Heidelberg was sold by Crown auction in 1838, making it one of the earliest rural allotments in Australia, as Melbourne was founded only three years earlier. By 1840, &quot;Warringal&quot; had been established as a surveyed township, the name referring to an Aboriginal term for &quot;eagle&#x27;s nest&quot;. Eventually, &quot;Warringal&quot; was changed to Heidelberg by a land agent, after the German city of Heidelberg. Following Anti-German sentiment during World War I, the Heidelberg City Council proposed to change the name to a British-sounding name, with the most prominent suggestion being Georgetown after British Prime Minister David Lloyd George. However, despite public debates and a community naming competition, the name Heidelberg remained unchanged.

When it was settled, Heidelberg was reached by track from Melbourne via Fitzroy North and, in 1841, the Heidelberg Road Trust was formed. As a form of Local Government, it preceded the Melbourne Town Council. By the late 1840s, the road had a toll bar at Merri Creek, and a Macadam surface. It became a tourist attraction, enhancing Heidelberg&#x27;s reputation as a desirable place for views, excursions and rural estates. Cattle overlander Joseph Hawdon built his Gothic Banyule Homestead in 1846, overlooking the Yarra Valley.

The Post Office opened on 19 October 1853 as &quot;Warringal&quot; and was renamed Heidelberg in 1865. Heidelberg was proclaimed a Shire on 27 January 1871.

Heidelberg&#x27;s rural scenery attracted artists during the 1880s, due to the absence of public utilities or a railway (until 1888), causing houses to be vacant, and available at low rents. Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton, Frederick McCubbin and other members of the Box Hill artists&#x27; camp relocated to Eaglemont in 1888, forming what was subsequently named the &quot;Heidelberg School&quot; of Australian art. Two years later, the Chartersville Homestead was occupied for similar purposes.

Heidelberg was proclaimed a city on 11 April 1934, but its rural space exceeded the urban area. The Heidelberg Town Hall was built in 1937. Subdivision and settlement clustered around Heidelberg Road and the Melbourne to Hurstbridge railway line, which bisected the municipality in a generally north-east direction. Along that line are Darebin, Ivanhoe, Eaglemont, Heidelberg, Rosanna, Macleod, Watsonia and Greensborough. Mont Park was reached by a spur line from Macleod. Heidelberg West, then and now unserved by a railway, was sparsely settled until the 1950s, when it was built on by the Housing Commission of Victoria. It also provided the site for the athletes&#x27; village for the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games.

By the 1970s, the residential development of the Heidelberg Municipality was complete, except for some areas in Viewbank and Lower Plenty. The shopping areas were mostly strips, but a free-standing centre was built in Heidelberg West in 1956, to a design by the Housing Commission which drew on American trends.

The population of Heidelberg Municipality (before the severances in the 1960s) was 8,610 (1911), 34,401 (1947, excluding Greensborough), and 60,007 (1961). The population in 1991 was 60,468. On 15 December 1994 most of Heidelberg City was united with part of Eltham Shire to form Banyule City.

Evidence of Heidelberg&#x27;s long history and early settlement can be found throughout the Municipality. The cemetery on Upper Heidelberg Road contains some of the oldest graves in Victoria. The Heidelberg Old Cemetery, the size of a house block near the corner of St James Road and Hawdon Street, contains graves dating to 1852. Heidelberg Primary School opened in 1854, Banyule Homestead was built in 1846, St John&#x27;s Anglican Church was built in 1849 and the Old England Hotel on Lower Heidelberg Road first opened its doors in 1848. All of these buildings still stand today.

==Population==
In the 2016 Census, there were 6,225 people in Heidelberg. 67.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were India 3.1%, China 2.8%, England 2.6% and Italy 1.9%. 69.7% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 3.4%, Italian 3.2% and Greek 2.0%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 34.8% and Catholic 27.6%.

==Facilities==



The administration of Austin Health is based in Heidelberg at the Austin Hospital. The Austin Hospital site has recently undergone extensive renovations, and now also contains the Mercy Hospital for Women. These two facilities combined measure up to be largest hospital in Victoria.

The Heidelberg Shopping Centre, known as &quot;Burgundy Street&quot; has recently been revived. It had become rundown in the 1980s, but a new supermarket, and many trendy cafes have made the area much more liveable; as a result, house prices have increased dramatically.

&quot;Burgundy Street&quot; is now known as Heidelberg Central Shopping Precinct and has over 230 retail/commercial and professional businesses. Over $1 million has been spent over the last 7 years to upgrade the infrastructure of the Precinct e.g. Aerial bundling of overhead power lines, resurfacing of the footpaths and roadways, installation of trees, seating, bollards, bike racks and rubbish bins and painting of all street furniture in the Precinct to &#x27;Burgundy&#x27; to suggest the boundaries of the retail strip. Heidelberg Central is also home to the historic Old England Hotel.

Melbourne Polytechnic has a campus in Heidelberg.

The Austrian Club Melbourne, previously in Fitzroy took up its current Heidelberg premises in November 1984.

Community radio station 96.5 Inner FM is located in Heidelberg, broadcasting from studios located within Warringal Shopping Centre.

Public library facilities are provided by Yarra Plenty Regional Library. The nearest library is in Ivanhoe.

===Warringal Shopping Centre===

Warringal Shopping Centre (formerly known as Centro Warringal) opened in 1987. It is a compact shopping centre located on Rosanna Road, with a main entrance on Burgundy Street. The centre serves a well defined main trade area population of approximately 41,000 residents from the established suburbs of Heidelberg, Viewbank, Rosanna, Ivanhoe and Eaglemont. The opening of the Austin/Mercy Hospital has seen a shift in the demographic profile with an increase in the number of young professionals moving into the area and an increased demand for the development of multi density housing.

<text>Heidelberg West is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 10 km north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Banyule local government area. Heidelberg West recorded a population of 5,252 at the 2021 census.

==Suburb==

Heidelberg West contains &quot;The Mall&quot;, an open style shopping centre constructed during the 1950s. The first store opened in The Mall was Dad&#x27;s Fruit Shop which opened on 4 October 1956 one week before the Olympic Games of the year. The proprietors were Hyman Wisel &amp; David East. The centre is to be redeveloped as a part of the urban renewal plan. Another shopping strip is situated at the end of Bell Street.

Darebin Creek, and its surrounding parklands act as Heidelberg West&#x27;s main public open space. The urban parts of Heidelberg West consist mostly of medium to low-density housing and development. A mobile library service managed by Yarra Plenty Regional Library visits Heidelberg West every Friday morning.

==History==

The Heidelberg West Post Office opened on 14 May 1923, and was renamed Heidelberg Heights around 1950. The current office on Oriel Road opened in 1952. The Heidelberg Military Hospital office opened in 1941 and was renamed to Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital in 1947.

In 1956, Heidelberg West became the site of the Summer Olympics athlete&#x27;s village. The village was converted into a Housing Commission of Victoria estate following the conclusion of the games, and in recent years has had properties sold into private hands. In 2006 the suburb was selected for urban renewal by the State Government because of its low socio-economic profile.

<doc id="611884" wikidata="Q3595213" url="?curid=611884" title="Lucky Ali">
<text>Maqsood Mahmood Ali (born 19 September 1958), better known as Lucky Ali, is an Indian singer, songwriter, and actor. He is considered an important artist to popularize pop culture and albums in Indian music and is considered one of the finest artists in India. With several popular singles and albums, he emerged as a significant figure of Indipop during the 1990s.

==Early life and education==
Ali is the second of the eight children of Bollywood actor, Mehmood Ali. His mother Mahliqa, was part Bengali and part Pashtun, and the younger sister of 1960s Indian Bollywood actress Meena Kumari. The Bollywood actress and dancer, Minoo Mumtaz, was his paternal aunt. He attended City Montessori School, Convent of Jesus and Mary, Hampton Court, Mussoorie, Manekji Cooper (Kindergarten) (Juhu), Bombay Scottish School in Mumbai, and the Bishop Cotton Boys&#x27; School, Bangalore.

===Connection with Tagore family===
His mother Mahliqa&#x27;s grandmother, Hem Sundari Tagore, was either the daughter or a widow of Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s distant cousin. After the death of her husband, she was forced by his family to leave for Meerut, where she became a nurse, married a Christian named Pyare Lal Shakir Meeruti (1880–1956), who was an Urdu journalist, and embraced Christianity. She had two daughters; one of whom was Prabhavati, Ali&#x27;s maternal grandmother.

==Personal life==
Ali has two children with his first wife Meaghan Jane McCleary – Ta&#x27;awwuz and Tasmiyah. He then married Inaya (Anahita, a Persian). With her, he has two children: Sara and Raiyan. He married a third time in 2010 to British model and former beauty queen Kate Elizabeth Hallam whom he divorced in 2017. The couple has a son named Dani Maqsood Ali.

Ali currently lives on the outskirts of Bengaluru in his farm house. His favourite places are Mecca and Medina.

Ali and his father shared a tempestuous relationship. Mehmood Ali was a very busy actor in the 1960s and &#x27;70s, and remained away from home for his shoots. Once, around the age of four when Ali first returned from boarding school, Mehmood and the entire family had come to receive Ali at the airport. Ali did not recognize his father, but on seeing him said, &quot;He&#x27;s the film comedian Mehmood!&quot; Ali lived away from his family in a St George&#x27;s College boarding school in Dehradun, Mussoorie. Ali&#x27;s tryst with marijuana led Mehmood to write the script of the movie &quot;Dushman Duniya Ka&quot; (Enemy of the World). The movie stars Ali&#x27;s youngest brother, Manzoor. It is the story of the drug abuse of a young man called Lucky. In the end, the young man kills his mother, destroys everything around him and is then killed by his father. Ali differed from his father&#x27;s vision and did not act in the movie. &quot;I felt the story lacked hope,&quot; he said. However, he sang his first song for the film.

<doc id="611885" wikidata="Q280110" url="?curid=611885" title="A38(M) motorway">
<text>The A38(M), commonly known as the Aston Expressway, is a motorway in Birmingham, England. It is long and was opened on 24 May 1972. It connects the M6 motorway to Aston and Central Birmingham and forms part of the much longer A38 route.

It is extremely unusual as it is the only single carriageway motorway in the United Kingdom and consists of seven lanes with no central reservation, and operates a tidal flow system in an attempt to minimise congestion. Due to the nature of the road, the speed limit is reduced to 50 mph (80 km/h) for most of its length with a very short length of 30 mph (48 km/h).

When construction work of the motorway began in the late 1960s, many late 19th-century and early 20th-century houses in the Aston area had to be demolished to make way for the new route.

==Route==
The A38(M) runs from the A5127 through Gravelly Hill Interchange where the A38 joins and then shortly after traffic from the M6 motorway also joins. It then enters a tidal flow section. The road is on a viaduct as it passes through Aston; this section cuts through the grounds of Aston Hall. The road passes through its first junction after . It enters a cutting before reaching the second junction, where the tidal flow ends as does the motorway. The motorway is curved in Aston to avoid an Ansells brewery. The motorway was also crossed by a vinegar pipeline, carrying the condiment from one part of the since-demolished HP Sauce factory to the other.

The traffic island at Dartmouth Circus was built where Aston Road met with Dartmouth Street, Bracebridge Street and Allesley Street. where the White Hart public house had been sited. Other than the A38(M) Aston Expressway, the circus also has exits to: 
* A4540 (ring road) east, Dartmouth Middleway (previously Dartmouth Street)
* A4540 (ring road) west, Newtown Middleway
* A38 south, upper Commercial Street (leads to St Chads Queensway)
* A5127 north, Aston Road (leads to Lichfield Road)
The traffic island at Dartmouth Circus preserves a re-erected Boulton and Watt steam engine (). The engine was built in 1817 and used in Netherton at the ironworks of M W Grazebrook.

==Tidal flow==
The Expressway was the first road in the United Kingdom to introduce tidal flow to allow better management of traffic. Lane use is controlled by means of electronic overhead signs, with one lane always closed to create a buffer between the two directions of travel – there is no central reservation. During the morning rush, four of the seven lanes are allocated to traffic heading into the city and two to traffic heading out of it. In the evening, this pattern is reversed. At all other times, the road runs with three lanes in each direction.

Motorcycles are banned from the red-surfaced central lane, which contains a drainage channel, regardless of how it is being used. This follows a fatal accident which occurred when one of the drainage covers came loose.

<doc id="611888" wikidata="Q1956633" url="?curid=611888" title="Memramcook">
<text>Memramcook, sometimes also spelled Memramcouke or Memramkouke, is a village in Westmorland County, New Brunswick, Canada. Located in south-eastern New Brunswick, the community is predominantly people of Acadian descent who speak the Chiac derivative of the French language. An agricultural village, it has a strong local patrimony, key to the history of the region. It was home to Mi&#x27;kmaqs for many years and was the arrival site of Acadians in 1700. A large part of these Acadians were deported in 1755, but the village itself survived.

The Collège Saint-Joseph was the first francophone university in the east of Canada, which opened its doors in 1864 and hosted/organized the first National Acadian Convention in 1881.

==History==
===Name===
Memramcook was called the &quot;Berceau de l&#x27;Acadie&quot;, which translates to &quot;cradle of Acadia&quot;. Long inhabited by the Mi&#x27;kmaq, the site saw the arrival of their allies, the Acadians in 1700. It now goes by the slogan of &quot;Notre belle vallée&quot;, since the recent re-branding of the village in May 2015. The village name is originally Mi&#x27;kmaq and means &quot;variegated&quot; referring to the many intricacies of the Memramcook River. The first mention of the area used the spelling Mémérancouque in 1757. The missionaries turned it into Memerancook, Memerancooque (1757), Memeramcook (1803), Memramkook (1812), Mamramcook (1812) and finally Memramcook. There have been several recent controversies about the name, such as people who offer the spelling Memramcouk or Memramkouke.

=== Origins ===
Mi&#x27;kmaq people were already established in the region for a couple hundred years before the Acadians arrived. Their main village and cemetery seemed to be in Beaumont, and they also had a camp at what is now today Saint-Joseph. Beaumont was a strategic location, giving that it allowed them to control the Petitcodiac River, the most important marine transport route in the region. Knockout, Bernard, Skéouite, Toudoi, Argémiche, Thomas and others were the common family names at the time.

Samuel de Champlain and Jean de Poutrincourt explored the region in 1605. They noted a rocky point (the Beaumont point) and no human presence. In 1612, Father Biard, Charles de Biencourt and their four Native American guides returned to visit Memramcook. At that time, there were about 60–80 cabins.

In 1672, Acadian and European word-runners and fishers started to frequent the area and some stayed to establish themselves. The village became a part of domain of La Vallière (Beaubassin) in 1676.

In 1698, Pierre Thibaudeau, Guillaume Blanchard, Pierre Gaudet and a few others left Port-Royal to explore Trois-Rivières. Pierre Gaudet, the youngest of the group, decided to stay in Memramcook. The village developed much more quickly after the signing of the Utrecht Treaty, which gave Acadia to England in 1713. Many families from Port-Royal moved to Memramcook at this time as it was still French territory.

Hamlets that would be later known as Pierre-à-Michel and Beaumont were founded in 1740. The Fort de La Galissoniére was constructed in 1751. Its job was to defend the entire isthmus of Chignecto, but was later replaced by Fort Beauséjour. Residents were also starting to construct the famous dyke system to dry out the marshes for agriculture. In 1752, the village was composed of 250 people from 51 different families. There were the Blanchards, Richards, Lanoues, Dupuis, Benoîts, Landrys, LeBlancs, Aucoins, Maillets, Girouards, Forests, Daigles, Savoies, Robichaud, Bastaraches, Heberts, Deslauriers, Cyrs, Bourques and Thibodeaus. People lived mostly along the river, and the first chapel was built in 1753 at Pointe-aux-Bouleaux, which is Ruisseau-des-Breau today.

===Deportation===
In August 1755, English soldiers were sent to Beaubassin, Petitcodiac, Chipoudy, and Memramcook to take the Acadiens prisoners. However, through guidance by the local missionary, Father LeGuerne, and the local people of the Miꞌkmaq nation, the Acadians hid in the woods. Then, on August 26, Lieutenant Boishébert of Miramichi and 125 soldiers and a group of Miꞌkmaq, surprised 200 Englishmen, under the command of Major Joseph Frye. The English had set fire to the church of Chipoudy and 181 homes, as well as 250 houses in Petitcodiac. Boishébert gave the order to attack at the moment that the English were setting fire to the church of Petitcodiac. After three hours of fierce fighting, the English retreated, leaving behind 50 dead, and around 60 wounded. It was thus that 200 families were able to escape the deportation.

=== Acadian renaissance ===
After the deportation, Memramcook Village became even more important to Acadia, as much for its population of 75 families in 1786 but also as a symbol of Acadian heritage. &quot;Old Acadia&quot; was the villages in the marshes of Grand-Pré or Port-Royal, and Memramcook was one of the only to not have been invaded by the English. Memramcook was also the first in New Brunswick to found a Catholic parish in 1781. During the colonisation of Northumberland, from 1785 to 1789, a good part of the colonists came from Memramcook. This laid the foundation for important villages like Bouctouche and Richibouctou.

In 1755, Joseph Frederick Wallet Desbarres bought the territory of the Pointe, which was essentially the village territory itself. The province of New Brunswick was created in 1784. Two years later, the Acadians living on the riverbank of river Memramcook received the conditions of the government. The first agreement was signed between Desbarres and the Acadians in 1784, through their agent Mary Cannon. People of the Pointe reclaimed for the first time their land in 1786. They received new requests for the area in 1792 and 1795, and the land was re-given to Desbarres in 1805. Another petition was created in 1808 and in 1821 they were given back their rightful land. A similar situation was experienced by the Acadians of l&#x27;Anse-des-Cormier in 1822. Desbarres died in 1824 at the age of 102. The property ownership conflict was fully resolved in 1841 and ratified in 1842, and habitants of the Pointe could buy land at the price of $1 per acre.

Interior development of the Memramcook Village continued. The Village-des-Piau was founded in 1769 and Pointe-à-l&#x27;Ours the year after. The village of Bonhomme Gould (today Lourdes) was founded in 1790. In 1782, the Thomas-François Le Roux abbey hosted the first resident priest. A new church was built in La Montain.

The Mi&#x27;kmaqs of Memramcook organized themselves more and more towards 1830 to combat social issues and difficulties related to weather and natural causes. They asked for the foundation of a native reserve, Fort Folly, which was realized in 1840 in Beaumont. They constructed the Chapel Sainte-Anne there 2 years later.

In 1854, Father François-Xavier Stanislas Lawrence founded the Saint-Thomas seminary, the first francophone college of Acadia. In 1862, the doors were closed due to financial problems. Father Camille Lefebvre arrived in 1864 as the new parish priest. He founded the Saint-Joseph college the same year in the seminary building.

The opening of the college contributed to an economic growth than continued in the village into the 19th century. Between 1800 and 1925, numerous quarries were exploited, specifically in Beaumont. The hamlet experienced expansion, counting 100 homes in 1860. Stone was a major industry there, being exported to the States from 4 quarries. The quarries eventually stopped their exportation to the USA because of taxes. Charbon and other mineral mines were also found in Beaumont. Four oil wells, some of the first in North America, were dug in 1859 in Pré-des-Surette by H.C Tweedal, an entrepreneur from Pittsburgh. They were not enterable but permitted for the discovery of Albert Formation, where other non-enterable wells were dug. From 1876 to 1879, other wells were built in Saint-Joseph. The New Brunswick Petroleum Company received an agreement for 99 years for this entire area. From 1903 to 1905, they dug 77 wells. The most bountiful well would give about 50 barrels a day, and it is estimated that 3000 barrels were extracted from the fields of Pré-des-Surette. There was also a copper mine, an iron mine at College Bridge from 1892 to 1898 and a gypsum mine in Memramcook East. Boats were built in Pré-d&#x27;en-Bas and in Beaumont. The village even had its own beurrerie from 1892 to 1908. There were also other industries and businesses, today most being gone, such as finishing, a mill and a foundry.

The first Acadian National Convention was held in Memramcook in 1881. The term Acadian was defined and the date for the national holiday was chosen.

=== Municipality development ===
Memramcook was founded in the early 1700s in the region of Beaubassin in Acadia, of New France. Acadia was taken over by the British in 1713, but the freedom afforded to the north of the Mesagoueche River, including Memramcook, was still contested. In 1768, Memramcook was annexed to Cumberland, Nova Scotia. New Brunswick was created in 1784 by the Sunbury region and part of Cumberland. Memramcook is now part of the county of Westmorland. The parish of Dorchester, created in 1787 by territories not in a county, included Memramcook at one point. In 1827, the parish of Shediac was formed with parts of the Dorchester parish, Sackville and Westmorland. The country of Westmorland was constituted in 1877. The municipality of the country was dissolved in 1966. The parish of Dorchester took over Westmorland again. Memramcook was incorporated as a town in 1995 incorporating the villages and communities of Saint-Joseph, Breau Creek, Cormier&#x27;s Cove, La Hêtrière, McGinley&#x27;s Corner, Memramcook, Memramcook East (Lourdes), Pré-d&#x27;en-Haut, Shediac Road, and a portion of the Parish of Dorchester.

<doc id="611892" wikidata="Q1038766" url="?curid=611892" title="Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi">
<text>was a member of the Japanese imperial family and a field marshal in the Imperial Japanese Army during the Meiji and Taishō periods. He was the father of Empress Kōjun (who in turn was the consort of the Emperor Hirohito), and therefore, the maternal grandfather of Emperor Emeritus Akihito and great grandfather of Emperor Naruhito.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi was born in Kyoto, the third son of Prince Kuni Asahiko (&quot;Kuni-no-miya Asahiko Shinnō&quot;) and the court lady Isume Makiko. His father, Prince Asahiko (also known as &quot;Shōren-no-miya Sun&#x27;yu&quot; and &quot;Nagakawa-no-miya Asahiko&quot;), was a son of Prince Fushimi Kuniye (&quot;Fushimi-no-miya Kuniie Shinnō&quot;), the head of one of &quot;ōke&quot; branch houses of the imperial dynasty entitled to provide a successor to the throne of Japan. In 1872, Emperor Meiji granted Prince Asahiko the title &quot;Kuni-no-miya&quot; and authorized him to begin a new branch of the imperial family.

Prince Kuniyoshi succeeded to the title upon his father&#x27;s death on 29 October 1891. His half-brothers, Prince Asaka Yasuhiko, Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko, Prince Nashimoto Morimasa, and Prince Kaya Kuninori, all formed new branches of the imperial family during the Meiji period.

===Military career===
Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi graduated from the 7th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1897 as a second lieutenant, and was promoted to lieutenant in February 1899 and to captain in March 1901. Promoted to major in the infantry in November 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War he was assigned to the staff of General Kuroki Tamemoto, commander of the IJA 1st Army. For his war services he was awarded the Order of the Golden Kite (4th class). He then graduated from the Army War College and was assigned to the 3rd Regiment of the Imperial Guards Division.

From 1907 to 1910, he studied military tactics in Germany and was attached to Second Regiment of the Prussian Foot Guards. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in April 1908 and to colonel in December 1910. Upon returning to Japan, Prince Kuni rose to the rank of major general in August 1913 and given command of the 38th Infantry Regiment. Later he commanded the Imperial Guard of Japan and rose to the rank of lieutenant general in August 1917 and commander of the IJA 15th Division. Along with that command, he received the additional post of chief priest of Meiji Shrine.

Prince Kuni became a full general and a member of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in August 1923. An early advocate of military aviation, one of his protégés was Yamamoto Isoroku, the future admiral and commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy. On 27 June 1929 (two days before his death), Emperor Hirohito promoted him to the honorary rank of field marshal and granted him the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum.

He was the target of a failed assassination attempt by in Taichung.

Prince Kuni&#x27;s death occurred soon after he arrived at his villa at Atami, of an acute onset of an undisclosed disease.

==Honours==
He received the following orders and decorations:
==Marriage and family==

On 13 December 1889, Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi married Shimazu Chikako (19 October 1879 – 9 September 1956), the seventh daughter of Prince Shimazu Tadayoshi, the last &quot;daimyō&quot; of Satsuma Domain. The marriage represented an alliance between the imperial family and the Satsuma clan.

<text>Ivanhoe East is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 10 km north-east from Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Banyule local government area. Ivanhoe East recorded a population of 3,762 at the 2021 census.

In the 12-month period to January 2020 Ivanhoe East reported a median house price of A$1.58 million for a three bedroom house.

==History==

Charterisville was built in about 1840, of sandstone quarried on the site, for David Charteris McArthur, Melbourne&#x27;s first bank manager. Following his death in 1887 part of the house was leased to artist Walter Withers. Charterisville became an important centre and artists&#x27; colony within the Heidelberg School. Ravenswood was begun in 1891 for financier Robert William Kennedy on four acres of land rising from the north side of Lower Heidelberg Road. The house is architecturally significant as a fine example of a Renaissance Revival mansion. Ivanhoe East Post Office opened on 1 November 1939.

==Today==

Lower Heidelberg Road is considered to be the suburb&#x27;s centre, which hosts a strip of retail stores. Although only a small area, Ivanhoe East has its own church, newsagent, fruit store, butcher, milk bar, supermarket, bakery and community bank. It also boasts a range of speciality stores.

According to a 2010 analysis by property research company, R.P. Data, Ivanhoe East is the most tightly held residential housing market in Australia, with residents holding on to their properties for an average of 16 years, compared with overall greater Melbourne and Sydney hold periods of 9.6 years and 8 years respectively. Over that 16-year period between May 1994 and May 2010 median house prices within Ivanhoe East have increased from A$250,000 to A$1.25 million, representing an annual average growth rate of approximately 10.6%. As at December 2010 the median house price in Ivanhoe East (for the 12 months to November 2010) was approximately A$1.4 million.

In a separate article The Age notes that &quot;there is no shortage of trees and parkland in Ivanhoe with large blocks, waterways and hilly vistas as trademarks of the area. Yet even with all its green charm, the suburb is just a 15-minute drive from the CBD and is classed as zone 1 for train travel&quot;. The Ivanhoe East area &quot;blending into Eaglemont&quot; is specifically described as &quot;the area&#x27;s more exclusive pocket&quot; with &quot;its own dedicated shopping village, which is much quieter than the strip shopping on Upper Heidelberg Road in Ivanhoe central&quot;.

Well regarded residential streets within the Ivanhoe East area include; The Boulevard and surrounding tree-lined streets such as Wallis Avenue, Otterington Grove, Hardy Terrace; Keam and Streeton on the Yarra River side, as well as properties within the Beauview Estate Heritage Overlay Precinct such as York, King and Beauview Parade.

Public library service is provided by Yarra Plenty Regional Library. The nearest library is in Ivanhoe.

===Education===
One primary school is located in the Ivanhoe East area: Ivanhoe East Primary School, a public school, located on Warncliffe Road, and backing onto Robin Hood Rd, just south of Lower Heidelberg Road. It comprises the main school as well as a middle school for years 2 and 3 on the site of the former Mother of God Primary School, which closed in 2017.

===Religion===
* Roman Catholic Church. The parish of Ivanhoe covers the district along with the neighbouring districts of Ivanhoe and Heidelberg. There are three churches in the parish: the Church of Mary, Mother of God at Robin Hood Road, Ivanhoe East; the Church of Mary Immaculate, Waverley Avenue, Ivanhoe; the Church of St Bernadette, 89 Bond Street, Ivanhoe West.
* Anglican Church. The parish church of St George is located at Warncliffe Road.

<doc id="611897" wikidata="Q6693710" url="?curid=611897" title="Lower Plenty, Victoria">
<text>Lower Plenty is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 16 km north-east from Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Banyule local government area. Lower Plenty recorded a population of 3,962 at the 2021 census.

Lower Plenty, in earlier times part of Eltham, almost certainly got its name from the Lower Plenty Toll Bridge, built in 1860 to collect tolls across the Plenty River. This bluestone bridge still stands as part of the Lower Plenty Trail. A report of a court case, in The Argus newspaper, dated 1 May 1879, reveals two lads, Corkhill and Hodgson, &quot;broke the windows of the old tollhouse, Lower Plenty bridge&quot;, some 19 years after the bridge was built.

The suburb is bounded by the Plenty River in the west until it joins the Yarra River, which forms the southern boundary. Fitzsimons Lane forms the eastern boundary and Airlie Road north of Main Road (a continuation of Lower Plenty Road from the west) forms the northern boundary.

==History==

In February 1855 Hungarian immigrant Sigismund Wekey purchased in what is now Lower Plenty, via The Victoria Vineyard and Garden Fruit Company of which he was manager, with a vision to start a wine industry in the new settlement of Melbourne.

In March 1855, Wekey held a meeting at the Bulleen Hotel and called for shareholders, each &quot;according to his means&quot;, for a proposed toll bridge, the first bridge ever built over the Upper Yarra, joining Lower Plenty to Templestowe, and replacing a punt being operated by the company. The bridge would cut five kilometres off the trip from the Eltham township to Melbourne, it was claimed at the meeting.

A plan, backed by a group of Melbourne businessmen who would form the &#x27;Templestowe Bridge Committee&#x27;, attracted the necessary shareholders and the project was underway. Colonial Architect of the day, James Balmain did the design as a private commission, engineers and builders were Allott and Greenwood. The foundation stone, laid by John Hodgson M.L.C., on 18 August 1855, concealed a manuscript giving details of the ceremony.

The bridge would have a span of 43 metres and a width of eight metres. It would cost £2200 English Pounds (AU$ in dollars). It would be located at the end of what is now Bonds Road, Lower Plenty, the land for this road being donated by local landowners John Seymour and David Bell, and the Central Road Board agreed to level the road to the bridge on the Templestowe side through the estate of Henry Stooke.

Meantime Wekey conceived a plan for another bridge at Studley Park to improve and shorten the trip to the city even further. By 21 September the plan for this second bridge was underway.

A stoppage in the works of the Templestowe Bridge was explained by Wekey on 22 September, as being a dispute between the Board and the contractors over payment when the foundation on the Lower Plenty side was found to be different from expected, causing a change in the design – the contractors were wanting more money to accommodate this.

Unfortunately in January 1856 the Victoria Vineyard and Garden Fruit Company was forced to sell its land. The sale was to Mr King for eight English Pounds an acre – the land had been acquired originally for £4.60 English Pounds an acre – but Wekey had been confident it would soon be worth £18-20 English Pounds per acre. The company was to be wound up shortly after.

It appears the Templestowe Bridge was operating by this time.

In March 1862, a deputation of Eltham residents approached the Commissioner of Railways and Roads, requesting the government to buy the Templestowe Bridge then give it back to the Eltham District Road Board, as while its toll earning capability was not as &quot;remunerative&quot; as had been hoped, the bridge was a &quot;great public convenience&quot;. The request was denied.

In October 1863 there was a great flood causing the Yarra to rise 12 metres. It even flooded Elizabeth Street in Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District. A number of bridges were washed away.

In March 1865 another deputation this time of Templestowe residents to the Acting Commissioner of Roads and Bridges, offered £600 English Pounds raised by them towards a new bridge to replace the Templestowe Bridge and requested a government grant towards the cost. The Acting Commissioner &quot;promised to give the matter further consideration&quot; though he did not see &quot;from what fund a sum of money could be granted to them&quot;.

A repair job was carried out in 1873 and 1874.

There were several more large floods, notably in October 1923, when the Templestowe Bridge, &quot;a solid wooden structure on an iron girder, with stone supports&quot; almost washed away again. The bridge also appears to have survived the significant December 1934 flood as it is mentioned in a news article in The Argus newspaper in February 1935. No other references have yet been discovered (regretfully no picture of Templestowe Bridge has been found and most residents don&#x27;t even know a bridge was there).

The last &#x27;bits&#x27; of the Templestowe Bridge, joining Bonds Road, Lower Plenty to Finns Reserve at Thompson&#x27;s Road, Templestowe, finally washed away in the 1960s.

Around 1855 another bridge was built in what is now Lower Plenty but over the Plenty River. The Lower Plenty Toll Bridge, referred to above, bluestone blocks and steel, still stands today and is part of the Plenty River Trail, close to the Heidelberg Golf Club and the Lower Plenty Hotel. It is possible that the Templestowe Bridge was similar in appearance to this.

&#x27;The Lower Plenty School&#x27; opened in 1876. At the time this area was part of Eltham.

Lower Plenty Post Office opened around 1902.

==Today==
Lower Plenty has a low density of urban dwellings compared to nearby suburbs, and is dominated by large homesteads that are built away from the main roads. These houses sharply contrast with the relatively undeveloped roads (some unsealed) and infrastructure of the area.

Outstanding natural features of Lower Plenty are the Yarra and Plenty Rivers. These are complemented by the Main Yarra Trail and the Plenty River Trail cycling and walking tracks, exposing the beauty of the rivers in a bushland setting, while joining Lower Plenty to the City and Docklands in one direction and in other directions to Greensborough and Montmorency, but also to Templestowe and Doncaster. Thus residents and visitors can enjoy the natural landscape of Lower Plenty knowing they also have offroad access via many lovely nature trails to all parts of the CBD and to the state public transport network. These natural features and bicycle/walking infrastructure are clearly shown in Banyule City&#x27;s freely available Travel Map.

The built-up features of Lower Plenty are the Heidelberg Golf Club, the Lower Plenty Hotel, the distinctive radio masts that rise above Bonds Road, and the Christian Brothers &quot;Amberley&quot; Retreat Centre on Amberley Way, home of the Edmund Rice Camps.

Lower Plenty also has a primary school, on the main road as well as a scout hall along Para Road. Also a baseball club is located at Glenauburn reserve.

==Sport==

The Lower Plenty Football and Cricket Clubs are located in nearby Montmorency, at Montmorency Park, on Para Road. Since 1995 the Lower Plenty Football Club (the &quot;Bears&quot;) have played in the Diamond Valley Football League (now the Northern Football League), after playing and winning a Premiership in the Panton Hill and District Football League during the 1980s. A victory after the siren in the 2018 Grand Final put Lower Plenty back into the Division 1 competition.

Golfers play at the course of the Rosanna Golf Club on Cleveland Avenue, or at the course of the Heidelberg Golf Club on Main Road.

<text>Mary McGrory (August 22, 1918 – April 20, 2004) was an American journalist and columnist. She specialized in American politics, and was noted for her detailed coverage of political maneuverings. She wrote over 8,000 columns, but no books, and made very few media or lecture appearances.

McGrory was a fierce opponent of the Vietnam War and was placed on Richard Nixon&#x27;s enemies list. Carlos Lozada wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that, 
==Early life and education==
She was born in the Roslindale neighborhood of Boston to Edward and Mary McGrory, a tight-knit Irish Catholic family. Her father was a postal clerk and she shared his love of Latin and writing. She graduated from the Girls&#x27; Latin School and Emmanuel College, both in Boston.

==Career==
McGrory began her career as a book reviewer at &quot;The Boston Herald&quot;.

In 1947, she was hired by &quot;The Washington Star&quot;, where she began her career as a journalist, a path she was inspired to take after reading &quot;Jane Arden&quot; comic strips. She rose to prominence covering the McCarthy hearings in 1954, during which she portrayed McCarthy as a typical neighborhood Irish bully. In 1975, McGrory won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for her articles about the Watergate scandal.

McGrory wrote extensively about the Kennedy presidency. She and John F. Kennedy were close in age, both of Irish descent, and both from Boston. McGrory&#x27;s exchange with Daniel Patrick Moynihan after the president&#x27;s assassination was quoted widely: &quot;We will never laugh again,&quot; said McGrory. Moynihan, who worked for President Kennedy responded, &quot;Mary, we will laugh again. But we will never be young again.&quot;

McGrory was assigned by the &quot;Star&quot; to travel with Robert F. Kennedy during his ill-fated 1968 presidential campaign and became close to his wife Ethel at the time.

In 1981, the day after &quot;The Washington Star&quot; ceased publishing, McGrory began her career at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

In 1985, McGrory received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Colby College. In 1998, she won the Fourth Estate Award, from the National Press Club.

==Awards and honors==
*1975: Pulitzer Prize for Commentary
*1995: Four Freedoms Award

==Works==

==Death and funeral ==
McGrory died in Washington, D.C. on April 20, 2004, at 85. After her death, she was interred at a tree-shaded cemetery on the edge of town.

<doc id="611906" wikidata="Q7367325" url="?curid=611906" title="Rosanna, Victoria">
<text>Rosanna is a north-eastern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 12 km north-east from Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Banyule local government area. Rosanna recorded a population of 8,616 at the 2021 census.

Rosanna is on the fringe of the Yarra Valley green belt.

Rosanna is famed for its beautiful parklands, recently updated train station, big homes, leafy streets, amenities and zoned for a number of high ranking public schools.

==History==
In 1838 Warringal Village was subdivided into nine portions (ranging in size from one to two square miles), with one of the largest portions, number 5, being purchased in 1840 by settler James Watson. He named the land Rose Anna Farm, after his wife Elizabeth Anna Rose. However, in April 1843 Watson encountered financial difficulties, was charged with fraud and was successfully sued. His company became insolvent and he was subsequently forced to subdivide and sell lots of the farm. Up until the early 1890s, four-fifths of the farm remained as an intact estate. However, in 1901 the Hurstbridge railway line was extended from Heidelberg to run to Rosanna, and in 1902 was further extended through to Eltham. This led to further subdivision and sale of lots.

The Rosanna Post Office opened on 12 March 1914, closed in 1917 and reopened in 1926.

In 1949 the shops along Lower Plenty Road, west of the railway crossing, consisted of a fuel merchant, post office, storekeeper, fruiterer, butcher and an estate agent. Numerous houses were being built, and two dairy farmers were east of the crossing. Ten years later there were 24 shops, including clothing and homewares. The growth of the local shopping centre signified the housing growth. In the next ten years housing spread outward from the railway line, and a three-fold increase in rates made the golf club move eastwards by 3 km.

=== Historical Buildings ===

The former fire station on Lower Plenty Road, Rosanna is a late work by the renowned Government Architect Percy Edgar Everett (1934-1953). Rosanna Fire Station is an excellent example of the work of Everett whose contribution to the design of public buildings in the Inter War period was exemplary. It is sited at an angle to the corner and is composed of a series of pavilions with flat roofs. The central part of the building was designed as accommodation for the fire trucks, has a raised roof and two sets of timber doors between rounded concrete pillars. The remainder of the building has a lower profile and contains accommodation for offices and a residence. Of cream face brick with timber framed modern windows, the building appears highly intact despite being adapted for a new use as a neighbourhood house. The building is composed of several parts with discrete low pitched roofs, and this combined with the angled siting give a very distinctive appearance to the building which is still highly intact. The building has some social significance as a fire station for over thirty years before adapting to a new community use as a neighbourhood house.

The house at 35 Douglas Street was built in 1958 for Joseph Simpson and designed by architect Robin Boyd, is of local aesthetic significance to the City of Banyule. Robin Boyd (1919 - 1971) was one of the leading exponents of modern architecture in Melbourne during the 1950s and 60s. This house is a representative example of the small residences built by Robin Boyd for private clients where he provided open plan living and passive solar designs at a time when this was rare in mainstream building. It is well designed for the sloping site and incorporates a lower ground floor at the rear, however this has been altered by additional glazing. The Joseph Simpson house is a relatively intact example of Boyd&#x27;s design work and displays many of the typical features of his work.

In The Age&#x27;s &quot;Liveable Melbourne&quot; report in 2019, Rosanna was ranked as Melbourne&#x27;s 99th-most-liveable of 307 suburbs. The suburb was described as, &quot;Rosanna, located 12 kilometres north-east of the CBD, is very accessible by bus and has decent access to trains. Among other strengths are the low crime and generous tree cover across hilly streets&quot;.

==Demographics==
According to 2021 census 65% of Rosanna&#x27;s reported they were born in Australia. The next country of birth top responses were China (excludes SARs and Taiwan) &amp; Italy both 3.2%, India 2.8%, England 2.5% &amp; New Zealand

The first known record of a newspaper in the Heidelberg area was 26 March 1897. This publication, known as the Heidelberg News and Diamond Creek Chronicle, was a four-page broadsheet with most of page one dedicated to advertisements.

The masthead has taken many forms over the years. Of particular note was when the City of Heidelberg was proclaimed in 1934 and the paper became The News - The Newspaper of the City of Heidelberg.

In 1949 the paper took its current tabloid format and incorporated the Shire of Eltham into its masthead; to become The News - The Newspaper of the City of Heidelberg and the Shire of Eltham.

On 12 November 1958, the first tabloid edition of the Heidelberger was published and the following year The News became the Rosanna and Diamond Valley News.

After 43 years as the Heidelberger, a new look paper emerged under the banner of the Heidelberg Leader on 28 May 2001, introducing a more contemporary style. The Suburb was described as: &quot;Rosanna, located 12 kilometres north-east of the CBD, is very accessible by bus and has decent access to trains. Among other strengths are the low crime and generous tree cover across hilly streets&quot;.

==Transport==

Rosanna&#x27;s main arterial roads are Lower Plenty Road and Rosanna Road.

The suburb is served by the Rosanna railway station on the Hurstbridge railway line. In 2018 the station received a major upgrade to remove the level crossing and runs many express services to the CBD.

Rosanna is served by two bus routes:

Route 513 - Eltham - Glenroy via Greensborough or Lower Plenty

Route 517 - Northland SC - St Helena via Greensborough &amp; Viewbank

Both these bus routes stop at the Rosanna railway station.

== Facilities ==
Rosanna Library is managed by Yarra Plenty Regional Library. In December 2020 Banyule City Council entered an agreement with Woolworths who owns adjoining land. The new library will be a three-story building with expanded children&#x27;s area, co-working and study spaces, community meeting rooms and other services and spaces. The redevelopment of Rosanna library is scheduled to finish by the end of 2025. A pop-up library is located at 56 Beetham Parade.

The Rosanna Fire Station Community House provides opportunities for all to learn, teach, make friends and give mutual support in an ethnically diverse, comfortable, accepting and co-operative environment. The Rotary Club of Rosanna District Inc installed a street library outside the fire station community house in 2019.

<doc id="611907" wikidata="Q3017494" url="?curid=611907" title="David Bellamy">
<text>David James Bellamy (18 January 1933 – 11 December 2019) was an English academic, botanist, television presenter, author and prominent environmental campaigner in the UK and globally. His distinctive, energetic style of presenting became well known to UK television audiences in the 1970s and 1980s. Later in life, he made some sceptical statements about climate science. 

==Early and personal life==
Bellamy was born at Queen Charlotte&#x27;s and Chelsea Hospital in London to parents Winifred May (née Green) and Thomas Bellamy on 18 January 1933. He was raised in a Baptist family and retained a strong Christian faith throughout his life. As a child, he had hoped to be a ballet dancer, but he concluded that his physique precluded him from pursuing the training.

Bellamy went to school in south London, attending Chatsworth Road Primary School in Cheam, Cheam Road Junior School, and Sutton County Grammar School. He said that he &quot;was never a model pupil&quot;. He gained an honours degree in botany at Chelsea College of Science and Technology (now part of King&#x27;s College London) in 1957 and a doctor of philosophy at Bedford College in 1960.

Bellamy was influenced by Gene Stratton-Porter&#x27;s 1909 novel &quot;A Girl of the Limberlost&quot; and Disney&#x27;s 1940 film &quot;Fantasia&quot;.

Bellamy married Rosemary Froy in 1959, and the couple remained together until her death in 2018. They had five children: Henrietta (died 2017), Eoghain, Brighid, Rufus, and Hannah. A resident of the Pennines in County Durham, Bellamy died from vascular dementia at a care home in Barnard Castle on 11 December 2019, at the age of 86.

==Scientific career==

Bellamy&#x27;s first work in a scientific environment was as a laboratory assistant at Ewell Technical College before he studied for a Bachelor of Science degree at Chelsea.
In 1960 he became a lecturer in the botany department of Durham University.
The work that brought him to public prominence was his environmental consultancy on the &quot;Torrey Canyon&quot; oil spill in 1967, about which he wrote a paper in the leading scientific journal, &quot;Nature&quot;.

==Publishing career and related==

Bellamy published many scientific papers and books between 1966 and 1986 (see #Bibliography). Many books were associated with the TV series on which he worked. During the 1980s, he replaced Big Chief I-Spy as the figurehead of the I-Spy range of children&#x27;s books, to whom completed books were sent to get a reward. In 1980, he released a single written by Mike Croft with musical arrangement by Dave Grosse to coincide with the release of the I-Spy title &quot;I Spy Dinosaurs&quot; (about dinosaur fossils) entitled &quot;Brontosaurus Will You Wait For Me?&quot; (backed with &quot;Oh Stegosaurus&quot;). He performed it on &quot;Blue Peter&quot; wearing an orange jump suit. It reached number 88 in the charts.

==Promotional and conservation work==
In the early 1970s, Bellamy helped to establish Durham Wildlife Trust, and remained a key player in the conservation movement in the Durham area for a number of decades.

The New Zealand Tourism Department, a government agency, became involved with the Coast to Coast adventure race in 1988 as they recognised the potential for event tourism. They organised and funded foreign journalists to come and cover the event. One of those was Bellamy, who did not just report from the event, but decided to compete. While in the country, Bellamy worked on a documentary series &quot;Moa&#x27;s Ark&quot; that was released by Television New Zealand in 1990, and he was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.

Bellamy was the originator, along with David Shreeve and the Conservation Foundation (which he also founded), of the Ford European Conservation Awards.

In 2002, he was a keynote speaker on conservation issues at the Asia Pacific Ecotourism Conference.

In 2015, David Bellamy and his wife Rosemary visited Malaysia to explore its wildlife.

In 2016, he opened the Hedleyhope Fell Boardwalk, which is the main feature of Durham Wildlife Trust&#x27;s Hedleyhope Fell reserve in County Durham. The project includes a 60-metre path from Tow Law to the Hedleyhope Fell reserve, and 150 metres of boardwalk made from recycled plastic bottles.

==Broadcasting career==

After Bellamy&#x27;s TV appearances concerning the &quot;Torrey Canyon&quot; disaster, his exuberant and demonstrative presentation of science topics featured on programmes such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me&quot; along with other scientific personalities such as Magnus Pyke, Miriam Stoppard, and Rob Buckman. He wrote, appeared in, or presented hundreds of television programmes on botany, ecology, environmentalism, and other issues. His television series included &quot;Bellamy on Botany&quot;, &quot;Bellamy&#x27;s Britain&quot;, &quot;Bellamy&#x27;s Europe&quot; and &quot;Bellamy&#x27;s Backyard Safari&quot;. He was regularly parodied by impersonators such as Lenny Henry on &quot;Tiswas&quot; with a &quot;gwapple me gwapenuts&quot; catchphrase. His distinctive voice was used in advertising.

== Activism ==

In 1983, Bellamy was imprisoned for blockading the Australian Franklin River in a protest against a proposed dam. On 18 August 1984, he leapt from the pier at St Abbs Harbour into the North Sea; in the process, he officially opened Britain&#x27;s first Voluntary Marine Reserve, the St. Abbs and Eyemouth Voluntary Marine Reserve. In the late 1980s, he fronted a campaign in Jersey, Channel Islands, to save Queens Valley, the site of the lead character&#x27;s cottage in &quot;Bergerac&quot;, from being turned into a reservoir because of the presence of a rare type of snail, but was unable to stop it.

In 1997, he stood unsuccessfully at Huntingdon against the incumbent Prime Minister John Major for the Referendum Party. Bellamy credited this campaign with the decline in his career as a popular celebrity and television personality. In a 2002 interview, he said it was ill-advised.

He was a prominent campaigner against the construction of wind farms in undeveloped areas, despite appearing very enthusiastic about wind power in the educational video &quot;Power from the Wind&quot; produced by Britain&#x27;s Central Electricity Generating Board.

David Bellamy was the president of the British Institute of Cleaning Science, and was a strong supporter of its plan to educate young people to care for and protect the environment. The David Bellamy Awards Programme is a competition designed to encourage schools to be aware of, and act positively towards, environmental cleanliness. Bellamy was also a patron of the British Homeopathic Association, and the UK plastic recycling charity Recoup from 1998.

==Views on global warming==

In Bellamy&#x27;s foreword to the 1989 book &quot;The Greenhouse Effect&quot;, he wrote:

The profligate demands of humankind are causing far-reaching changes to the atmosphere of planet Earth, of this there is no doubt. Earth&#x27;s temperature is showing an upward swing, the so-called greenhouse effect, now a subject of international concern. The greenhouse effect may melt the glaciers and ice caps of the world, causing the sea to rise and flood many of our great cities and much of our best farmland.

Bellamy&#x27;s later statements on global warming indicate that he subsequently changed his views. A letter he published on 16 April 2005 in &quot;New Scientist&quot; asserted that a large proportion (555 of 625) of the glaciers being observed by the World Glacier Monitoring Service were advancing, not retreating. George Monbiot of &quot;The Guardian&quot; tracked down Bellamy&#x27;s original source for this information and found that it was from discredited data originally published by Fred Singer, who claimed to have obtained these figures from a 1989 article in the journal &quot;Science&quot;; however, Monbiot proved that this article had never existed. Bellamy subsequently accepted that his figures on glaciers were wrong, and announced in a letter to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 2005 that he had &quot;decided to draw back from the debate on global warming&quot;, although Bellamy jointly authored a paper with Jack Barrett in the refereed &quot;Civil Engineering&quot; journal of the Institution of Civil Engineers, entitled &quot;Climate stability: an inconvenient proof&quot; in May 2007.

In 2008 Bellamy signed the Manhattan Declaration, calling for the immediate halt to any tax-funded attempts to counteract climate change. He maintained a view that man-made climate change is &quot;poppycock&quot;, insisting that climate change is part of a natural cycle.

His opinions changed the way some organisations viewed Bellamy. The Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts stated in 2005, &quot;We are not happy with his line on climate change&quot;, and Bellamy, who had been president of the Wildlife Trusts since 1995, was succeeded by Aubrey Manning in November 2005. Bellamy asserted that his views on global warming resulted in the rejection of programme ideas by the BBC.

<text>Fenella Fielding (born Fenella Marion Feldman; 17 November 1927 – 11 September 2018) was an English stage, film and television actress who rose to prominence in the 1950s and 1960s, and was often referred to as &quot;England&#x27;s first lady of the double entendre&quot;. She was known for her seductive image and distinctively husky voice. Fielding appeared in two &quot;Carry On&quot; films, &quot;Carry On Regardless&quot; (1961) and &quot;Carry On Screaming!&quot; (1966).

==Early life and education==
Fenella Marion Feldman was born on 17 November 1927 in Whitechapel, London, to a Romanian Jewish mother, Tilly (&quot;&quot; Katz; 1902–1977), and a Lithuanian Jewish father, Philip Feldman.

She was the younger sister of Basil, later Baron Feldman. She grew up in Lower Clapton and later Edgware where she attended North London Collegiate School. Her father at one time managed a cinema in Silvertown, east London. She later resided in Chiswick, west London.

==Career==
Fielding began her acting career in 1952, concentrating on stage productions, including the Bromley Little Theatre. She was given her first break when she accompanied the then-unknown actor Ron Moody to an audition (they had met in an amateur production at the London School of Economics). Her performance in Sandy Wilson&#x27;s musical version of &quot;Valmouth&quot; made her a star in 1958. By 1959 she was appearing with Kenneth Williams in the comedy revue &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot;, written by Harold Pinter and Peter Cook. Fielding also guested in the &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; episode &quot;The Poetry Society&quot; broadcast in December 1959. Between 1960 and 1962 Fielding played Janet Harris, a liberated secretary at an advertising firm, in the BBC radio sitcom &quot;Something to Shout About&quot;. In 1960 Fielding appeared on tv as the Contessa in the very last episode of the tv series of The Four Just Men (Traviso Dam).

Fielding later starred in her own television programme &quot;Izeena&quot; (1966). She had occasional guest appearances in television programmes such as &quot;The Avengers&quot; (after being passed over as Patrick Macnee&#x27;s regular partner in favour of Honor Blackman) and in &quot;Danger Man&quot;. She appeared in four episodes of &quot;Morecambe and Wise Show&quot; between 1969 and 1972. She was in two of the &quot;Carry On&quot; films, the second was her role as the vampish Valeria in &quot;Carry On Screaming !&quot; (1966), and three of the Doctor films (including &quot;Doctor in Clover&quot;). She interspersed these with performances in plays by Ibsen, Shakespeare and Henry James, reputedly keeping an edition of Plato&#x27;s writings by her bed. Other theatre credits around this time included Sheridan and Chekhov. In 1977 she appeared on BBC TV&#x27;s long running show, &quot;The Good Old Days&quot; performing &#x27;Only A Glass of Champagne&#x27; and &#x27;How&#x27;d You Like to Spoon with Me?&#x27;.

Fielding was the uncredited Village announcer in &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (1967–68), and co-starred with Tom Poston and Robert Morley in the remake of &quot;The Old Dark House&quot; (1963). In &quot;Dougal and the Blue Cat&quot;, based on &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot;, she voiced the character of the Blue Voice, referred to as &quot;Madam&quot; by both Buxton (the blue cat of the title) and Dougal at various stages throughout the film. In the late 1960s, Fielding was approached by Federico Fellini to work on one of his films, but turned the work down because she was already booked to perform on stage at the Chichester Festival Theatre.

Fielding also starred in the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Uncle Jack&quot; from 1990-1993 as the notorious villainess, The Vixen. In 1999, Fielding starred in Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson&#x27;s film &quot;Guest House Paradiso&quot;. She toured in a production of &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; the same year. In 2011, Fielding appeared at the Jermyn Street Theatre, London in an English Chamber Theatre presentation of Jane McCulloch&#x27;s &quot;Dearest Nancy, Darling Evelyn&quot;, the dramatised letters of Nancy Mitford and Evelyn Waugh.

From 2012, Fielding performed readings of English translations of Greek classics by David Stuttard. Her partners for this were Simon Russell Beale and later Stephen Greif. Her memoir was published in both audio and book form in 2017 and led to a number of appearances on stage reading extracts from it in places all over the UK.

Fielding was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2018 Birthday Honours for services to drama and charity.

==Voice work==
Fielding voiced “The Blue Voice” in the 1972 English adaptation of the 1970 French film ‘Dougal And The Blue Cat’, &#x27;MOOD&#x27;, the quirky supercomputer in the video game Martian Gothic in a script written by science fiction author Stephen Marley. After 2000 she recorded with &quot;Savoy&quot;, a book publishing and recording company. Her work with them includes readings of Colette, J. G. Ballard&#x27;s &quot;Crash&quot; and T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Four Quartets&quot;. She made an album of cover songs including Robbie Williams&#x27;s &quot;Angels&quot;, Kylie Minogue&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;, New Order&#x27;s &quot;Blue Monday&quot; and the White Stripes&#x27; &quot;Passive Manipulation&quot;. In 2006, she toured Ireland in &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. She provided the voice to two tracks on the Graham Roos album &quot;Quest&quot;. In the following years, Fielding was a regular guest contributor on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s PM and Broadcasting House.

==Critical reception==
A 2007 article in &quot;The Independent&quot; remarked that it was &quot;one of the mysteries of British life that Fenella Fielding, whose wit and distinctive stage presence captivated figures such as Kenneth Tynan, Noël Coward and Federico Fellini, should have drifted into obscurity rather than being celebrated&quot;, and the same article quotes &quot;The Times&quot; as saying that Fielding&#x27;s performance as Hedda Gabler was &quot;one of the experiences of a lifetime&quot;. A 2017 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; highlighted a career &quot;renaissance in recent years&quot; and describes Fielding as a phenomenal storyteller. &quot;She reminds me of the great raconteur Quentin Crisp – the same love of language, mastery of its rhythms, perfectly formed sentences, and a joie de vivre even when relating her profound despair.&quot;
Fielding is the subject of MetaFenella, a 2014 online artwork by artist Martin Firrell.

==Death==
Fielding suffered a stroke on 25 August 2018 and died two weeks later at Charing Cross Hospital in Hammersmith, on 11 September 2018, aged 90. She never married nor had children.

<text>Simpson Barracks is an Australian Army facility in the suburb of Yallambie in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It is named after Major General Colin Hall Simpson, Signals Officer-in-Charge of Allied Land Forces during the Second World War.

Simpson Barracks is home to the DFSS (Defence Force School of Signals), Financial Services Unit, Defence Force School of Music, and the headquarters of 4th Brigade. It also has depots for 4th/19th Prince of Wales&#x27;s Light Horse Regiment and 108th Signals Squadron.
It also is the main workshop for 105 Field Workshop (RAEME). It also houses the Victorian Headquarters for the Australian Army Cadets, 402 Squadron, Australian Air Force Cadets and 39 Army Cadet Unit Watsonia.

Simpson Barracks was constructed out of red brick which was the style in the mid-1930s and during the Second World War, red brick was discarded in favour of timber buildings clad with corrugated galvanised iron or asbestos sheet.

The Simpson Barracks Post Office opened on 31 March 1987 replacing the Macleod office open since 1923, and was closed in 1996. A Watsonia Military Post Office was open from 1942 until 1946 and a Watsonia Camp office was open from 1948 until 1952.

Simpson Barracks also has its own chapel, where over 250 weddings have been celebrated since it opened in 1971. It was modelled on the chapel in Nui Dat in South Vietnam. The Simpson Barracks Chapel has seating capacity for 80 people, and has a regular Eucharist/Mass. Baptisms and funerals are also held there.

The Royal Australian Army Corps of Signals Museum and Royal Australian Army Pay Corps Museum are located at Simpson Barracks.

<text>Viewbank is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 14 km north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Banyule local government area. Viewbank recorded a population of 7,030 at the .
The area now known as Viewbank is on the traditional lands of the Wurundjeri people. The Birrarung (Yarra River) and large tracts of the Yarra Valley Parkland run along one border of the suburb. The Plenty River forms Viewbank&#x27;s eastern boundary, whilst its northern boundary is defined by Lower Plenty Road (a main road linking Heidelberg and Eltham). Although mainly a residential area, there is a small commercial strip on Martins Lane adjacent to Viewbank Primary School.

==Past and present==
===Wurrundjeri are the traditional owners of the land===
The traditional owners of the land where Viewbank is are the Wurundjeri. Settlement and dispossession of the Wurundjeri lands began soon after a ceremony in which Wurundjeri leaders conducted a tanderrum ceremony, whose function was to allow outsiders temporary access to the resources of clan lands.

===Viewbank Homestead===

After a millennia of living in the area, the Wurundjeri were displaced and Viewbank was settled by Edward Willis in 1837 and was named after the homestead property built at the junction of the Yarra River and Plenty River constructed in 1839 by pastoralist James Williamson. It was later added to by Dr. Robert Martin. It was owned by the Bartram family 1922-1974 who operated the property as a dairy. The homestead was demolished in the 1920s after the house had fallen into disrepair. Local residents believed it was haunted.

Between 1996 and 1999, Heritage Victoria conducted excavations at the site with the help of archaeologists from University of Melbourne, La Trobe University and Flinders University with more than 140 archaeology students and members of the community. Stone foundations of the house with remnants of hand-made brick walls, fireplaces and other features were uncovered. Artefacts including toys, game tokens, thimbles and pins were found. Articles of affluence were also found in the form of a network of servant&#x27;s bells, fragments of marble fireplaces and decorated plaster cornices were also uncovered.

Remnants of Viewbank&#x27;s farming past can be seen from the historic silos still standing on Banyule Road. The site is recognised as having historical and archaeological significance to the State of Victoria, and is listed on the Victorian Heritage Database.

===Other history===
Mollison Lodge at 32 Old Lower Plenty Road was built in 1916. It is considered a good example of the Federation Bungalow style, and is enhanced by its mature garden setting. Few pastoral or agricultural buildings survive from the early 20th century, with Mollison Lodge being one of the important exceptions.

There were many rural allotments along the Yarra River, of which the house at 7 Walker Court appears to be an example, making it of local historical significance. The building is one of the few houses dating from the 19th century remaining in the area, and appears in an early painting.

The area was primarily developed around the 1960s. Viewbank Post Office opened on 1 October 1962 and was renamed Banyule in 1969.

Located near The Silo, the famous Flécher Cottage was named after Fletcher Brown.
Several new housing developments were built during the 1990s and 2000s, including the end of Martins Lane, Winston Hills and Eagle View (on Casey Crescent).

==Facilities==

There are very few facilities in Viewbank. The nearest libraries are at Rosanna and Eltham. The nearest pools are in Ivanhoe, Eltham and Heidelberg - all about a 15 to 20 minute drive away. The closest train station, Rosanna Station, is a 10-minute drive away with limited parking or a 40-minute walk. There are no cafes or places to dine in Viewbank.

===Parks and wetlands===

*Banyule Flats Reserve encompasses a large wetland of over 46 acres and is considered the largest grassy woodland in inner Melbourne.
*Castleton Park
*Price Park
*Viewbank Reserve

==Education==
* Viewbank Primary School is located in Nevin Parade, Rosanna East. It opened in 1966 with a staff of six and an enrolment of 97 pupils ranging from beginners to Grade six. It was not until 1968 when the enrolment rose to 285 pupils, that the school was officially opened. By this time extensive works had taken place on the 5.8 acre property including sealed areas, drainage, reticulation of water, concrete paths and garden beds with concrete edging.
*Viewbank College (formerly Rosanna East High School, merging with Banyule High School in 1994).

==Climate==
The Viewbank area has an Oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb). Out of all official weather stations in the Melbourne area, Viewbank records the highest annual average maximum temperatures; owing to its location just north of the Yarra Valley Parklands and Melbourne&#x27;s densely populated eastern suburbs, resulting in a reduction of the cool southerly airflow that is common in the Melbourne area on most days. The temperature difference between Viewbank and central areas of Melbourne is more pronounced during the warmer months (Viewbank is marginally cooler during the winter months). In the warmer months, Viewbank can occasionally be as much as 10 degrees warmer than Melbourne Olympic Park (Melbourne&#x27;s official weather station) during daylight hours, despite being only 14 km away.

<doc id="611919" wikidata="Q21346306" url="?curid=611919" title="Sri Lankan junglefowl">
<text>The Sri Lankan junglefowl (Gallus lafayettii sometimes spelled &quot;Gallus lafayetii&quot;), also known as the Ceylon junglefowl or Lafayette&#x27;s junglefowl, is a member of the Galliformes bird order which is endemic to Sri Lanka, where it is the national bird. It is closely related to the red junglefowl (&quot;G. gallus&quot;), the wild junglefowl from which the chicken was domesticated. However, it is even more closely related to the grey junglefowl. Sri Lankan junglefowl and red junglefowl diverged about 2.8 million years ago, whereas time of divergence between the Sri Lankan junglefowl and grey junglefowl was 1.8 million years ago.

Evidence of introgressive hybridization from Sri Lanka junglefowl has also been established in domestic chicken. The specific name of the Sri Lankan junglefowl commemorates the French aristocrat Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette (1757–1834).

==Description==
As with other junglefowl, the Sri Lankan junglefowl is strongly sexually dimorphic; the male is much larger than the female, with more vivid plumage and a highly exaggerated wattle and comb.

The male Sri Lankan junglefowl ranges from in length and in weight, essentially resembling a large, muscular rooster. The male has orange-red body plumage, and dark purple to black wings and tail. The feathers of the mane descending from head to base of spine are golden, and the face has bare red skin and wattles. The comb is red with a yellow centre. 

As with the green junglefowl, the cock does not possess an eclipse plumage.

The female is much smaller, at only in length and in weight, with dull brown plumage with white patterning on the lower belly and breast, ideal camouflage for a nesting bird.
==Classification==
This is one of four species of birds in the genus &quot;Gallus&quot;. The other three members of the genus are red junglefowl (&quot;G. gallus&quot;), grey junglefowl (&quot;G. sonneratii&quot;), and green junglefowl (&quot;G. varius&quot;).
The Sri Lankan junglefowl is most closely related to the grey junglefowl, though physically the male resembles the red junglefowl. Female Sri Lankan junglefowl are very similar to those of the grey junglefowl. Like the green junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl are island species that have evolved side by side with their similarly stranded island predators and competitors. Uniquely complex anti-predator behaviors and foraging strategies are integral components in the long evolutionary story of the Sri Lankan junglefowl.

==Habitat==
It is common in forests and scrub habitats, and is commonly spotted at sites such as Kitulgala, Yala, and Sinharaja. This species is found from sea-level up to 2000 metres of elevation.
==Behaviour==
As with other jungle fowl, Sri Lankan jungle fowl are primarily terrestrial. They spend most of their time foraging for food by scratching the ground for various seeds, fallen fruit, and insects.

Females lay two to four eggs in a nest, either on the forest floor in steep hill country or in the abandoned nests of other birds and squirrels. Like the grey and green junglefowl, male Sri Lankan junglefowl play an active role in nest protection and chick rearing.

== Reproduction ==
The reproductive strategy of this species is best described as facultative polyandry, in that a single female is typically linked with two or three males that form a pride of sorts. These males are likely to be siblings. The female pairs with the alpha male of the pride and nests high off the ground.

Her eggs are highly variable in colour, but generally are cream with a yellow or pink tint. Purple or brownish spots are common. Occasionally, a female produces red eggs or blotched eggs.
The hen incubates her eggs, while the alpha male guards her nest from a nearby perch during the nesting season. The beta males remain in close proximity, and guard the nesting territory from intruders or potential predators, such as rival males, or snakes and mongooses. Sri Lankan junglefowl are unique amongst the junglefowl in the brevity of their incubation, which may be as short as 20 days as contrasted with the 21–26 days of the green junglefowl.

The chicks require a constant diet of live food, usually insects and isopods such as sowbugs and pillbugs. In particular, the juveniles of land crabs are also highly important to the growth and survivability of the juvenile and subadult Sri Lankan junglefowl. In captivity, this species is particularly vulnerable to a poultry disease caused by the bacteria &quot;Salmonella pullorum&quot; and other bacterial diseases common in domestic poultry.
The chicks, and to a slightly lesser extent the adults, are incapable of using vegetable-based proteins and fats. Their dietary requirements cannot be met with commercial processed food materials. As a result, they are exceedingly rare in captivity.

==Sound==
While foraging on the ground, the Ceylon junglefowl male utters some short calls “kreeu, kreeu, kreeuu”. It also utters high-pitched rooster-like crow “cor-cor-chow” at dawn, often from a tree-branch. The female gives some “kwikkuk, kwikkukkuk”. The male is more vocal during the breeding season with advertising calls and various sounds during displays, as well with female as with rivals and in territorial defence.

==In other languages==
In Sinhala, it is known as () and in Tamil, it is known as இலங்கைக் காட்டுக்கோழி (&quot;ilaṅkaik kāṭṭukkōḻi&quot;).

==Tailless mutant==
In 1807, a tailless Sri Lankan junglefowl was described by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck (1778–1858). He named them &quot;Gallus ecaudatus&quot;.

<doc id="611939" wikidata="Q6139909" url="?curid=611939" title="USS Toledo (CA-133)">
<text>USS &quot;Toledo&quot; (CA-133) was a &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class heavy cruiser of the United States Navy active during the Korean War.

&quot;Toledo&quot; was laid down on 13 September 1943 at Camden, New Jersey, by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, launched on 6 May 1945, sponsored by Mrs Edward J. Moan, and commissioned at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 27 October 1946, Captain August J. Detzer, Jr., in command.

==Service history==

===1947===
On 6 January 1947, the heavy cruiser got underway for a two-month training cruise in the waters of the West Indies. After completing shakedown training out of Guantanamo Bay, she visited St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands; Kingston, Jamaica; and Port-au-Prince, Haiti, before returning north to Philadelphia and a three-week post-shakedown availability. On 14 April, she departed Philadelphia and shaped a course across the Atlantic. &quot;Toledo&quot; steamed through the Mediterranean, transited the Suez Canal, crossed the Indian Ocean, and arrived at Yokosuka, Japan, on 15 June. &quot;Toledo&quot; remained in the Far East visiting Japanese and Korean ports in support of occupation forces until October. On the 21st, she stood out of Yokosuka for her first transpacific voyage and steamed via Pearl Harbor to Long Beach, California, where she arrived on 5 November.

===1948===
On 3 April 1948, she departed Long Beach in company with the heavy cruiser and shaped a course for Japan. She arrived in Yokosuka on the 24th and began her second tour of occupation duty patrolling for contraband smugglers. Later that spring, the cruiser made a goodwill cruise to the Indian Ocean during which she stopped at Karachi, Pakistan; Singapore, Malaya; Trincomalee, Ceylon; and Bombay, India. After her return to the northwestern Pacific in early summer, &quot;Toledo&quot; operated out of Tsingtao, China, during the evacuation of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist Chinese forces to Taiwan. On 16 September, the warship departed the China coast and headed for Bremerton, Washington, entering the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 5 October for her first major .

===1949–1950===
The cruiser&#x27;s refurbishing was completed on 18 February 1949; and she headed back to Long Beach for six months of training along the coasts of California, Mexico, and the Isthmus of Panama. Among other exercises, she participated in Operation Miki, a simulated air-sea assault on Pearl Harbor. On 14 October, &quot;Toledo&quot; stood out of Long Beach to resume duty in the Far East. For eight months, she cruised the waters between Japan, China, the Philippines, and the Marianas.

&quot;Toledo&quot; returned to Long Beach on 12 June 1950, less than two weeks before North Korean forces invaded the Republic of Korea (ROK), beginning the Korean War. Ten days later, &quot;Toledo&quot; pointed her bow west once more and embarked upon her fourth cruise to the Orient and her first tour of combat duty.

&quot;Toledo&quot; made a brief stop at Pearl Harbor en route and continued on to Sasebo, where Rear Admiral John M. Higgins, Commander, Cruiser Division 5, broke his flag in her on 18 July 1950. Eight days later, the cruiser took up station off the eastern coast of Korea a few miles north of Pohang, near Yongdok. She teamed up with Destroyer Division 91 to form one of the two alternating East Coast Support Elements of Task Group 95.5. From 27 July to 30 July, &quot;Toledo&quot;, , and bombarded North Korean communication arteries which started at Yongdok and ran north between the mountains and the sea to the 38th parallel north. On 4 August, the task element joined Air Force fighters in a combined air-sea strike on an enemy-held village near Yongdok. The following day, her 8-inch guns, directed by airborne controllers, rendered call-fire for the front-line troops. &quot;Toledo&quot; then moved some 70 miles north to the area around Samchok where she cruised along a 25-mile stretch of coastline and shelled a number of targets. During that interdiction run, she demolished a bridge, chewed up highway intersections, and generally wreaked havoc on communist supply lines. On the 6th, &quot;Helena&quot; relieved &quot;Toledo&quot;, enabling her to return to Sasebo for upkeep.

The warship resumed station off the Korean coast on 15 August and operated with , &quot;Mansfield&quot;, &quot;Collett&quot;, and along a 40-mile length of coast from Songjin south to Riwon. After a number of bombardment missions, she returned to Sasebo again on the 26th and remained there until 31 August when she headed for a week of duty off Pohang Dong.

&quot;Toledo&#x27;s&quot; next important mission was the landing at Inchon in mid-September. The heavily armed and fortified island of Wolmi-do – located in the harbor – threatened the success of the operation. Therefore, &quot;Toledo&quot; and her previous consorts – augmented by , , and Royal Navy light cruisers, and – entered the harbor to silence the island&#x27;s guns on 13 September. The destroyers led the way through the mine-infested channel and moved in close to draw enemy fire while the cruisers stood off waiting for the North Koreans to betray their positions. By early afternoon, the artillery duel had begun; and the enemy suffered most. That evening, the cruisers and destroyers retired for the night. They returned the next day to finish the job. Then, after two days of preparatory bombardment, marines of the 3rd Battalion Landing Team, 5th Marines, stormed Wolmi-do&#x27;s defenses. Meanwhile, &quot;Toledo&quot; redirected her fire to support the 1st Marines who were about to land on &quot;Blue Beach&quot; just south of Inchon proper. After reportedly destroying three gun emplacements and a number of machine gun nests, closing two tunnels, hitting trenches and mortar positions, &quot;Toledo&quot; retired for the night at 1525.

&quot;Toledo&quot; continued fire-support missions until early October. However, after the 18th, the marines had advanced beyond the range of her 8-inch guns; and &quot;Toledo&quot; shifted to support troops mopping up bypassed pockets of enemy resistance. On 5 October, she departed the area and steamed for Sasebo.

The cruiser returned to the Korean coast at Chaho Han on 13 October, conducted shore bombardments in preparation for the amphibious operation at Wonsan, and reentered Sasebo the following day. The warship got underway again a little before midnight on the 18th and arrived off Wonsan early the next morning. For the next three days, she supported the marines during their advance inland from Wonsan.

On 22 October, &quot;Toledo&quot; departed Korea and, after stops at Sasebo and Yokosuka, headed for the United States on the 27th. Steaming via Pearl Harbor, she arrived in Long Beach on 8 November and remained there until the 13th when she headed for San Francisco. The following day, she entered the Hunter&#x27;s Point Naval Shipyard and began a three-month overhaul.

====1951====
Refurbishment completed, &quot;Toledo&quot; left the yard on 24 February 1951 and returned to Long Beach the next evening. Following a round-trip voyage to San Diego, the warship weighed anchor on 2 April to return to the western Pacific. She stopped over at Pearl Harbor from the 7th to the 9th and then continued on to Sasebo, where she arrived on the 18th.

&quot;Toledo&quot; began her second tour of duty in the Korean combat zone on 26 April. For the next month, she cruised off the coast near Inchon where she provided gunfire support for the front-line troops of the US I Corps, guarding the Han River line during the communist spring offensive of 1951. Throughout that month, however, the enemy generally remained well beyond the river, out of range of the cruiser&#x27;s 8-inch battery.

On 26 May, she steamed north to Kansong and joined Task Element 95.28 to conduct an interdiction bombardment of the area. Then, between 28 May and 30 May, the enemy did venture close enough to the Han to allow &quot;Toledo&quot; to bring her main battery to bear, but only at extreme range. The cruiser spent the first 10 days of June at Yokosuka; then returned to the Korean coast on 12 June. On 18 June, she teamed up with and to pummel the important enemy logistics junction located at Songjin.

The warship made a brief visit to Sasebo before heading back to Wonsan where, on the 27th, she joined in shelling the enemy ashore. The following evening, she endured her first hostile fire when shore batteries opened up on the cruiser and came dangerously close on several occasions.

&quot;Toledo&#x27;s&quot; tour of duty along the eastern coast of Korea lasted until late November. She bombarded Wonsan, Songjin, and Chongjin and rescued several downed pilots — one, from
, twice. Late in October, her guns supported the 1st Marine Division in operations near Kansong. While conducting a shore bombardment on 11 November, she again came under fire from an enemy shore battery which scored some close near misses.

On 24 November, &quot;Toledo&quot; completed her deployment to the western Pacific and stood out of Yokosuka to return to the United States. After a pause at Pearl Harbor from 1 to 3 December, she continued on to Long Beach, where she arrived on the 8th.

====1952====
In January 1952, after a month of leave and upkeep, &quot;Toledo&quot; began seven months of duty operating out of Long Beach, conducting drills and training exercises along the west coast of the United States until mid-August. On 16 August, the cruiser stood out of Long Beach to return to the western Pacific. After the customary stop at Pearl Harbor, she arrived in Yokosuka on 8 September.

&quot;Toledo&quot; embarked upon her third combat tour along the coast of Korea on 12 September when she stood out of Yokosuka. During the latter part of the month, her 8-inch guns aided the American X Corps and the ROK I Corps. She supported the United Nations forces&#x27; limited offensives and holding actions while armistice talks dragged on. Periodically, she cleared that area to participate in gun strikes near Wonsan and in coastal patrols. On 24 September, she was called upon to provide continuous illumination fire and to silence an enemy 120-millimeter howitzer while United Nations forces recaptured positions recently lost to the communists.

She made an overnight port call at Sasebo on the 29th and 30th, visited the Bonin Islands from 2 through 4 October, and stopped at Yokosuka on the 5th and 6th, before taking up station on the bombline once more on the 8th. On 11 October, she joined the carriers of TF 77 and, for the next three months, alternated frequently between that duty and shore bombardment assignments. On 12 October, an enemy 75 millimeter gun managed to straddle her with eight rounds before 48 rounds from her 5-inch battery silenced it. Just before 0200 on the 14th, a gun opened fire from the same spot, scoring three near misses but no hits. Other than those instances and some long-range snooping by MiG 15&#x27;s, little action came &quot;Toledo&#x27;s&quot; way during her third and final Korean War deployment.

====1953====
In mid-January 1953, she visited Hong Kong for rest and relaxation before resuming patrols off Wonsan and Songjin and fire support duties for the American X and ROK I Corps. On 28 February 1953, &quot;Toledo&quot; departed Yokosuka and shaped a course for the United States. Following an overnight stop at Oahu on the night of 10 March and 11 March, the cruiser moored at Long Beach on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, 1953. She departed Long Beach on 13 April and, after a two-day call at San Diego, arrived in San Francisco on the 16th. There, she entered the Hunter&#x27;s Point Naval Shipyard for a five-month overhaul.

&quot;Toledo&quot; was still undergoing repairs when hostilities in Korea ended with the armistice of 27 July 1953. She departed San Francisco on 10 September and, after operations along the coast, headed for Pearl Harbor on 20 October. The cruiser reached Yokosuka on 7 November and began her seventh deployment to the Far East. Though the Korean War had ended the previous summer, American forces continued to patrol the waters along the Korean peninsula; and &quot;Toledo&quot; joined them in the endeavor. In fact, she spent the next six months operating out of Sasebo and Yokosuka in the waters between Japan and Korea and in the East China Sea. She visited Pusan, Inchon, and Pohang as well as Okinawa and Hong Kong. In addition to patrolling the neutral waters off the Korean coast, she periodically conducted exercises with the carriers of TF 77.

===1954–1955===

On 13 April 1954, the warship entered Yokosuka for upkeep following exercises in the Sea of Japan and preparatory to her return home. Three days later, she began her transpacific passage. She made the usual call at Pearl Harbor and tied up at Long Beach on May Day.

With one notable exception, &quot;Toledo&#x27;s&quot; eighth deployment to the Far East set the pattern for all those to follow. After almost five months of normal operations along the western coast of the United States, the cruiser cleared Long Beach on 14 September. She stopped at Pearl Harbor on the 21st for five days of rest and relaxation and then continued her voyage to Yokosuka where she arrived on 7 November. For the most part, her deployment consisted of training operations, goodwill calls at a number of ports, and general patrol and show-the-flag duties. During this tour of duty, she visited Hong Kong, Kobe, Nagasaki, Beppu, Subic Bay, and Manila.

The single exception to this peaceful routine came in January 1955. &quot;Toledo&quot; joined TF 77 in the waters between Taiwan and the communist Chinese mainland to support another evacuation of Nationalist Chinese forces — this time from the Tachen Islands. She took station about 1,500 yards off the islands as flagship of the naval gunfire support group. Throughout the operation, she and the other units of the group provided close-in support for the amphibious craft engaged in the actual evacuation. At the completion of that operation, the cruiser resumed the duties which became her normal Far Eastern routine.

On 5 March 1955, she departed Japan in company with to return to the United States and arrived in Long Beach 17 days later. She conducted operations along the west coast until 16 June when she began a four-month overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton. The cruiser resumed duty late in October and cruised the west coast until early in 1956.

===1956–1959===

&quot;Toledo&#x27;s&quot; active Navy career lasted four more years. During that period, she made four more deployments to the western Pacific. All save one consisted of routine operations, conducted out of bases in Japan and in the Philippines. The one exception came early in 1958. The cruiser cleared the west coast on 19 February and reached Japan early in March. However, after visiting Sasebo and Yokosuka, she headed south to Australia rather than to normal 7th Fleet operations. She reached Sydney on 30 April and remained there for five days as a guest of the Australian government during the 15th anniversary celebration of the Battle of the Coral Sea. After Sydney, &quot;Toledo&quot; also visited Melbourne before returning north to Japan via Okinawa to resume 7th Fleet operations. The deployment ended on 26 August 1958 when &quot;Toledo&quot; steamed back into Long Beach. The warship made one more deployment to the western Pacific between 9 June and 25 November 1959.

===Decommissioning and scrapping===
On 5 January 1960, she entered Long Beach Naval Shipyard to begin inactivation overhaul. &quot;Toledo&quot; completed preparations and was placed out of commission at Long Beach on 21 May 1960. She was moved to San Diego soon thereafter and remained there, in reserve, for the next 14 years.

On 1 January 1974, her name was struck from the Navy List, and she was sold to the National Metal and Steel Corporation, Terminal Island, California, on 30 October 1974 for $983,461.29.

<doc id="611940" wikidata="Q1456848" url="?curid=611940" title="Rolls-Royce Spey">
<text>The Rolls-Royce Spey (company designations RB.163 and RB.168 and RB.183) is a low-bypass turbofan engine originally designed and manufactured by Rolls-Royce that has been in widespread service for over 40 years. A co-development version of the Spey between Rolls-Royce and Allison in the 1960s is the Allison TF41.

Intended for the smaller civilian jet airliner market when it was being designed in the late 1950s, the Spey concept was also used in various military engines, and later as a turboshaft engine for ships known as the Marine Spey, and even as the basis for a new civilian line, the Rolls-Royce RB.183 Tay.

Aviation versions of the base model Spey have accumulated over 50 million hours of flight time. In keeping with Rolls-Royce naming practices, the engine is named after the River Spey.

==Design and development==

In 1954 Rolls-Royce introduced the first commercial bypass engine, the Rolls-Royce Conway, with 17,500 lbf (78 kN) of thrust aimed at what was then the &quot;large end&quot; of the market. This was far too large for smaller aircraft such as the Sud Caravelle, BAC One-Eleven or Hawker Siddeley Trident which were then under design. Rolls-Royce then started work on a smaller engine otherwise identical in design derived from the larger RB.140/141 Medway - which itself had been cancelled after British European Airways (BEA) had demanded the downsizing of the Trident, the RB.163, using the same two-spool compressor arrangement and a smaller fan delivering bypass ratios of about 0.64:1. Designed by a team under Frederick Morley, the first versions of what had become the &#x27;Spey&#x27; entered service in 1964, powering both the 1-11 and Trident. Several versions with higher power ratings were delivered through the 1960s, but development was ended nearing the 1970s due to the introduction of engines with much higher bypass ratios, and thus better fuel economy.

In 1980, Turbomecanica Bucharest acquired the license for the Spey 512-14 DW version, which propelled the Romanian built BAC One-Eleven aircraft (Rombac One-Eleven).

Spey-powered airliners remained in widespread service until the 1980s, when noise limitations in European airports forced them out of service.

===Tailored for the Buccaneer and Corsair II===

In the late 1950s the Soviet Union started the development of the Sverdlov-class cruisers that would put the Royal Navy at serious risk. The Naval Air Warfare Division decided to counter this threat with a strike aircraft which would fly at very high speed at very low level. The winning design was the Blackburn Buccaneer.
The first version of the Buccaneer, the S.1 powered by the de Havilland Gyron Junior, was underpowered in certain scenarios, although not in maximum speed, and the engine was unreliable. The Spey was chosen in 1960 as a re-engining option to give more thrust for a Buccaneer Mk.2. It was also predicted to increase range by 80%. The engine was a militarized version of the BAC 1-11 Spey, and called the RB.168-1. The Buccaneer S.2 served into the 1990s.

A Spey derivative, designed and developed jointly by Rolls-Royce and Allison for the LTV A-7 Corsair II, was produced under licence in the United States as the TF41.

=== F-4K and M Phantom ===

The British versions of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II (designated Phantom FG.Mk.1 and FGR.Mk.2) replaced the 16,000 lb wet thrust J79 turbojets with a pair of 20,515 lb wet thrust Spey 201 turbofans. These provided extra thrust for operation from smaller British aircraft carriers, and provided additional bleed air for the boundary layer control system for slower landing speeds. The air intake area was increased by twenty per cent, while the aft fuselage under the engines had to be redesigned. Compared to the original turbojets, the afterburning turbofans produced a ten and fifteen per cent improvement in combat radius and ferry range, respectively, and improved take-off, initial climb, and acceleration, but at the cost of a reduction in top speed because compressor outlet temperatures would be exceeded in an essentially subsonic civil design. 

===Reliability===

During its lifetime the Spey has achieved an impressive safety record. Its relatively low maintenance costs provide one of the major reasons it remained in service even when newer designs were available. With the need for a 10,000 to 15,000 lbf (44 to 67 kN) thrust class engine, with better specific fuel consumption and lower noise and emission levels, Rolls-Royce used Spey turbomachinery with a much larger fan to produce the Rolls-Royce Tay.

===AMX development===

A fully updated version of the military RB.168 was also built to power the AMX International AMX attack aircraft.

<text>USS &quot;Gunnel&quot; (SS-253), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the gunnel.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Gunnel&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company, Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 17 May 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Ben Morell, wife of the Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, and commissioned on 20 August 1942, with Lieutenant Commander John S. &quot;Jack&quot; McCain, Jr. in command.

==Atlantic patrol==
&quot;Gunnel&quot;s first war patrol (19 October – 7 December 1942) covered a passage from the United States to the United Kingdom, during which she participated in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa. One of six submarines assigned to Admiral Henry K. Hewitt&#x27;s Western Naval Task Force, &quot;Gunnel&quot; did reconnaissance off Fedhala, French Morocco, on 6 November 1942, two days before the invasion, and on D-day, 8 November 1942, made infrared signals to guide the approaching fleet to the beachheads. She was off Casablanca, French Morocco, on the morning of 8 November when a United States Army Air Forces P-40 Warhawk fighter mistakenly strafed her, forcing her to crash-dive. At 12:03, an aircraft &quot;Gunnel&quot;′s crew identified as an American bomber began an attack run against her, forcing her to crash-dive again. Her crew heard an explosion as she passed through a depth of . &quot;Gunnel&quot; suffered no damage or casualties in either attack.

With her missions accomplished, &quot;Gunnel&quot; departed the waters off French North Africafor Rosneath, Scotland, on 7 December 1942 to terminate her first patrol. &quot;En route&quot; home, the drive gears of her HOR engines failed, forcing her to complete the final on her auxiliary diesel engine, leading to a major overhaul at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine.

==Pacific patrols==

===Second and third patrols===
Subsequently, assigned to the United States Pacific Fleet, &quot;Gunnel&quot; proceeded to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, then to her second war patrol (28 May – 3 July 1943) in waters west of Kyūshū in the East China Sea. Success crowned her efforts when she sank the cargo ship &quot;Kayo Maru&quot; (6,300 gross register tons) on 15 June 1943, giving &quot;Gunnel&quot; her first kill, and four days later when another cargo ship, &quot;Tokiwa Maru&quot; (7,000 gross register tons), was sent under. Both sinkings were confirmed by Joint Army–Navy Assessment Committee (JANAC) postwar.

After overhaul at Mare Island, California, the submarine accomplished a third war patrol (17 November 1943 – 7 January 1944) in Japanese home waters off Honshū. This, too, was successful; on 4 December 1943 &quot;Gunnel&quot; sent passenger-cargo ship &quot;Hiyoshi Maru&quot; to the bottom.

===Fourth, fifth, sixth patrols===
The fourth war patrol (5 February – 6 April 1944) took &quot;Gunnel&quot; from Midway Atoll to Fremantle, Australia, and in the South China, Sulu, and Celebes Seas. Bad luck dogged &quot;Gunnel&quot; and she was forced to return to port having made no further kills. On 29 March 1944, during her return voyage, a United States Army Air Forces Fifth Air Force B-24 Liberator mistakenly attacked her off Australia, dropping a bomb as she crash-dived. She suffered no damage or casualties. After an overnight stop at Darwin, Australia, she proceeded to Fremantle, where she concluded her patrol on 6 April 1944.

&quot;Gunnel&quot;′s fifth and sixth patrols, 3 May – 4 July 1944 and 29 July – 22 September 1944, found her again in the southern approaches of the Sunda Strait and cruising in the Sulu Sea-Manila area but failed to add to her score.

===Seventh and eighth patrols===
During her seventh patrol (21 October – 28 December 1944) in the South China and Sulu Seas, she sank the Torpedo Boat &quot;Sagi&quot; (600 tons) between 4–8 November; passenger-cargo ship &quot;Shunten Maru&quot; (5,600 tons); and Torpedo Boat &quot;Hiyodori&quot; (600 tons) between 10 and 17 November. On this same patrol &quot;Gunnel&quot; evacuated 11 naval aviators at Palawan 1 to 2 December after the fliers had been protected by friendly guerrilla forces for some 2 months.

She conducted her eighth patrol (13 June – 24 July 1945) in the Bungo Suido area. She attacked an unescorted Japanese submarine 9 July. The great range and speed of the enemy, however, caused &quot;Gunnel&quot;&#x27;s torpedoes to miss. She returned from the patrol after duty as a lifeguard ship for B-29s flying toward Japan on bombing missions.

==Postwar==
&quot;Gunnel&quot; was refitting at Pearl Harbor at war&#x27;s end in August 1945. She was ordered to New London, Connecticut, where she decommissioned 18 May 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy List 1 September 1958 and she was sold for scrapping in August 1959.

==Honors and awards==
* European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with one battle star
* Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal with four battle stars

&quot;Gunnel&quot;′s first, second, third, and seventh war patrols were designated &quot;successful.&quot; In the Joint Army-Navy Assessment Committee (JANAC) accounting postwar, she was credited with six ships sunk totaling 24,624 gross register tons.

<doc id="611954" wikidata="Q99533625" url="?curid=611954" title="Rescue of Jews during the Holocaust">
<text>During World War II, some individuals and groups helped Jews and others escape the Holocaust conducted by Nazi Germany.

The support, or at least absence of active opposition, of the local population was essential to Jews attempting to hide but often lacking in Eastern Europe. Those in hiding depended on the assistance of non-Jews. Having money, social connections with non-Jews, a non-Jewish appearance, perfect command of the local language, determination, and luck played a major role in determining survival. Jews in hiding were hunted down with the assistance of local collaborators and rewards offered for their denunciation. The death penalty was sometimes enforced on people hiding them, especially in eastern Europe, including Poland. Rescuers&#x27; motivations varied on a spectrum from altruism to expecting sex or material gain; it was not uncommon for helpers to betray or murder Jews if their money ran out.

Jews were hidden or saved by non-Jews throughout Nazi-occupied Europe. The Catholic Church and Vatican opposed the systemic murder of Jews, and in Italy the Mussolini government refused to deport Jews or participate in their mass murder. Many diplomats were involved in efforts to help Jews escape, such as by providing documents that allowed safe transit.

Since 1953, Israel&#x27;s Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, has recognized 26,973 people as Righteous among the Nations. Yad Vashem&#x27;s Holocaust Martyrs&#x27; and Heroes&#x27; Remembrance Authority, headed by an Israeli Supreme Court justice, recognizes rescuers of Jews as Righteous among the Nations to honor non-Jews who risked their lives during the Holocaust to save Jews from extermination by Nazi Germany.

== By country ==
=== Poland ===

Poland had a very large Jewish population, and, according to Norman Davies, more Jews were both killed and rescued in Poland than in any other nation: the rescue figure usually being put at between 100,000–150,000. The memorial at Bełżec extermination camp commemorates 600,000 murdered Jews and 1,500 Poles who tried to save Jews. 6,532 men and women (more than from any other country in the world) have been recognized as rescuers by Yad Vashem in Israel., constituting the largest national contingent. Martin Gilbert wrote that &quot;Poles who risked their own lives to save the Jews were indeed the exception. But they could be found throughout Poland, in every town and village.&quot;

Poland during the Holocaust of World War II was under total enemy control: initially, half of Poland was occupied by the Germans, as the General Government and Reichskomissariat; the other half by the Soviets, along with the territories of today&#x27;s Belarus and Ukraine. The death penalty was threatened for individuals hiding Jews and their families. The list of Polish citizens officially recognized as Righteous includes 700 names of those who lost their lives while trying to help their Jewish neighbors. There were also groups, such as the Polish &quot;Żegota&quot; organization, that took drastic and dangerous steps to rescue victims. Witold Pilecki, a member of Armia Krajowa, the Polish Home Army, organized a resistance movement in Auschwitz from 1940, and Jan Karski tried to spread the word of the Holocaust.

When AK Home Army Intelligence discovered the true fate of transports leaving the Jewish Ghetto, the council to Aid Jews – &quot;Rada Pomocy Żydom&quot; (codename &quot;Żegota&quot;) – was established in late 1942 in co-operation with church groups. The organization saved thousands. Emphasis was placed on protecting children, as it was nearly impossible to intervene directly against the heavily guarded transports. False papers were prepared, and children were distributed among safe houses and church networks. Two women founded the movement: the Catholic writer and activist Zofia Kossak-Szczucka and the socialist Wanda Filipowicz. Some of its members had been involved in Polish nationalist movements, which were themselves anti-Jewish, but which became appalled by the barbarity of the Nazi mass murders. In an emotional protest prior to the foundation of the council, Kossak wrote that Hitler&#x27;s race murders were a crime about which it was not possible to remain silent. While Polish Catholics might still feel Jews were &quot;enemies of Poland&quot;, Kossak wrote that protest was required: &quot;God requires this protest from us... It is required of a Catholic conscience... The blood of the innocent calls for vengeance to the heavens.&quot;

In the 1948–49 Zegota Case, the Stalin-backed regime established in Poland after the war secretly tried and imprisoned the leading survivors of Zegota as part of a campaign to eliminate and besmirch resistance heroes who might threaten the new regime.

Jews were aided also by diplomats outside Poland. The Ładoś Group was a group of Polish diplomats and Jewish activists who created in Switzerland a system of illegal production of Latin American passports aimed at saving European Jews from the Holocaust. About 10,000 Jews received such passports, of whom over 3,000 have been saved. The group efforts are documented in the Eiss Archive. Jews were also helped by Henryk Sławik, in Hungary, who helped save over 30,000 Polish refugees, including 5,000 Polish Jews by giving them false Polish passports with a Catholic designation, and by Tadeusz Romer in Japan.

=== Greece ===
The Foundation for the Advancement of Sephardic Studies and Culture writes &quot;One cannot forget the repeated initiatives of the head of the Greek Christian Orthodox Metropolitan See of Thessaloniki, Gennadios, against the deportations, and most of all, the official letter of protest signed in Athens on March 23, 1943, by Archbishop Damaskinos of the Greek Orthodox Church, along with 27 prominent leaders of cultural, academic and professional organizations. The document, written in a very sharp language, refers to unbreakable bonds between Christian Orthodox and Jews, identifying them jointly as Greeks, without differentiation. It is noteworthy that such a document is unique in the whole of occupied Europe, in character, content and purpose&quot;.

The 275 Jews of the island of Zakynthos, however, survived the Holocaust. When the island&#x27;s mayor, Loukas Karrer (Λουκάς Καρρέρ), was presented with the German order to hand over a list of Jews, Bishop Chrysostomos returned to the amazed Germans with a list of two names; his and the mayor&#x27;s. Moreover, the Bishop wrote a letter to Hitler himself stating that the Jews of the island were under his supervision. In the meantime the island&#x27;s population hid every member of the Jewish community. When the island was almost levelled by the great earthquake of 1953, the first relief came from the state of Israel, with a message that read &quot;The Jews of Zakynthos have never forgotten their Mayor or their beloved Bishop and what they did for us.&quot;

The Jewish community of Volos, one of the most ancient in Greece, had fewer losses than any other Jewish community in Greece thanks to the timely and dynamic intervention and mobilization of the massive communist-leftist partisan movement of EAM-ELAS (National Liberation Front (Greece) – Greek People&#x27;s Liberation Army) and the successful cooperation of the head of the Greek Christian Orthodox Metropolitan See of Demetrias Joachim and the chief rabbi of Volos, Moses Pesach for the evacuation of Volos from the Jewish people, after the events in Thessaloniki (displacement of the city&#x27;s Jews to concentration camps).

Princess Alice of Battenberg and Greece, who was the wife of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and the mother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and mother-in-law of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, stayed in occupied Athens during the Second World War, sheltering Jewish refugees, for which she is recognized as &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot; at Yad Vashem.
Although the Germans and Bulgarians deported a great number of Greek Jews, others were successfully hidden by their Greek neighbors.

82-year-old Simon Danieli traveled from Israel to his birthplace in Veria to thank the descendants of the people who helped him and his family escape Nazi persecution during World War II. Danieli was 13 in 1942 when his family—father Joseph, a grain merchant, mother Buena, and nine siblings—fled Veria to escape the increasingly frequent atrocities committed by Nazi forces against the city&#x27;s Jews. They ended up in a small nearby village in Sykies, where the family was taken in by Giorgos and Panayiota Lanara, who offered them shelter, food and a hiding place in the woods, helped also by a priest, Nestoras Karamitsopoulos. The Nazis, however, soon stormed Sykies, where around 50 more Jews from Veria had also taken refuge. They questioned the priest about the whereabouts of the Jews, but when Karamitsopoulos refused to answer, they began raiding people&#x27;s homes. They found Jews hidden in eight homes, and promptly set fire the houses. They also turned their wrath on the priest, torturing him and pulling out his beard, according to Danieli.

=== France ===

Père Marie-Benoît was a French Capuchin priest who helped smuggle approximately 4,000 Jews into safety from Nazi-occupied Southern France and subsequently was recognized by Yad Vashem as a Righteous among the Nations in 1966. The French town of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon sheltered several thousand Jews. The Brazilian diplomat Luis Martins de Souza Dantas illegally issued Brazilian diplomatic visas to hundreds of Jews in France during the Vichy Government, saving them from almost certain death. Si Kaddour Benghabrit, the religious head of the Islamic Center of France, helped more than a thousand Jews by providing forged identity papers to the Jews of Paris during the German occupation of France. He also managed to hide many Jewish families in the rooms of Paris Mosque as well as in the residencies and women&#x27;s prayer areas.

=== Belgium ===

In April 1943, members of the Belgian resistance held up the twentieth convoy train to Auschwitz, and freed 231 people. Several local governments did all they could to slow down or block the registration processes for Jews they were obliged to perform by the Nazis. Many people saved children by hiding them away in private houses and boarding schools. Of the approximately 50,000 Jews in Belgium in 1940, about 25,000 were deported—though only about 1,250 survived. Marie and Emile Taquet sheltered Jewish boys in a residential school or home. Bruno Reynders was a Belgian monk who defied the Nazis, as he implemented the directive of Pope Pius XII to save the Jews, worked with local orphanages, Catholic Nuns and the Belgian Underground to forge false identities for Jewish children whose parents willingly gave them up in an attempt to spare their lives faced with deportation to the death camps. Pere Bruno risked his life for his values and to save the lives of an estimated 400 Jewish children and is honored as a Righteous Gentile at Yad Vashem.

L&#x27;abbé Joseph André is another Catholic priest who secured safe hiding places with Belgian families, orphanages and other institutions for Jewish children and adults.

=== Denmark ===

The Jewish community in Denmark remained relatively unaffected by Germany&#x27;s occupation of Denmark on 9 April 1940. The Germans allowed the Danish government to remain in office and this cabinet rejected the notion that any &quot;Jewish question&quot; should exist in Denmark. No legislation was passed against Jews and the yellow badge was not introduced in Denmark. In August 1943, this situation was about to collapse as the Danish government refused to introduce the death penalty as demanded by the Germans following a series of strikes and popular protests. The German empire forced the Danish government to shut down. During these events, German diplomat Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz tipped off Danish politician Hans Hedtoft that the Danish Jews would be deported to Germany following the collapse of the Danish government. Hedtoft alerted the Danish resistance and the Jewish leader C.B. Henriques informed the acting Chief Rabbi Marcus Melchior in the absence of the Chief Rabbi Max Friediger who had already been arrested as a hostage on 29 August 1943, urging the community to go into hiding in service on 29 September 1943. During the following weeks, more than 7,200 of Denmark&#x27;s 8,000-strong Jewish communities were ferried to neutral Sweden hidden in fishing boats. A small number of Jews, some 450 in all, were captured by the Germans and shipped to Theresienstadt. Danish officials were able to ensure that these prisoners weren&#x27;t shipped to extermination camps, and Danish Red Cross inspections and food packages ensured focus on the Danish Jews. Swedish Count Folke Bernadotte ensured their release and transport to Denmark in the final days of the war.

=== Netherlands ===
Based on its 1940 population of 9 million the 5,516 Jews rescued in the Netherlands represents the largest per capita number: 1 in 1,700 Dutch was awarded the Righteous Among the Nations medal. Notable rescuers include:
* Willem Arondeus, Dutch artist and resistance fighter who helped forge documents allowing Jewish families to flee the country
* Gertruida Wijsmuller-Meijer, who helped save about 10,000 Jewish children from Germany and Austria just before the outbreak of the war (Kindertransport) and on the last transport ship leaving the Netherlands to the UK in May 1940
* L. P. J. de Decker Dutch Ambassador to the Baltic States in Riga, 1940. He removed from the required visa text the need to have the Governor of Curacao&#x27;s approval to enter. This was a ruse to allow Jews to escape from Lithuania. He instructed, authorized honorary Dutch consul in Kovno, Lithuania Jan Zwartendijk to issue modified end visas to Jews in Lithuania. With the added help ofChiune Sempo Sugihara, Japanese consul in Kovno, thousands of Jews escaped the Holocaust via Japan and then Shanghai.
* Jan Zwartendijk, who as a Dutch consular representative in Kaunas, Lithuania, at Dutch Ambassador L.P.J. deDecker&#x27;s request issued modified Curacao visas used by between 6,000 and to 10,000 Jewish refugees.
* Those who hid and helped Anne Frank and her family, like Miep Gies. 
* Caecilia Loots, a teacher and antifascist resistance member, who saved Jewish children during the war.
* Marion van Binsbergen helped save approximately 150 Dutch Jews, most of them children, throughout the German occupation of the Netherlands. 
* Tina Strobos, rescued over 100 Jews by hiding them in her house and providing them with forged paperwork to escape the country.
* Jan van Hulst (18 December 1903 – 1 August 1975), instrumental in preventing Jews from being deported and murdered during the Holocaust.
* The participants of the so-called &quot;Amsterdam dock strike&quot; (better known as the February strike, about 300,000 to 500,000 people who on 25 and 26 February 1941 took part in the first strike against persecution of the Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe).
* The village of Nieuwlande (117 inhabitants) that set up a quota for residents to rescue Jews.

=== Serbia ===
After the Invasion of Yugoslavia, the country was occupied by Germany and some regions were occupied by Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria and Albania. A joint German-Italian puppet state called Independent State of Croatia was installed. After a bombing campaign on major Serbian cities, a German puppet regime Nedić’s Serbia led by Milan Nedić was installed. In collaboration with the German Army, Serbian Chetnik collaborators along with the Serbian Volunteer Corps as well as the Serbian State Guard assisted in the persecution of Jews in Serbia proper, in Hungarian-occupied Vojvodina region, and in the territory held by the Croatian Ustashas. Serbian Jews who were not transported to concentration camps in Germany were either murdered in Nazi concentration camps within Serbia (Sajmište and Banjica), Banjica being jointly controlled by Nedic&#x27;s Government and the German Army, or transported to Ustasha-controlled concentration camp Jasenovac and murdered there. Jews living in Hungarian-occupied regions faced mass executions, the most notorious being the Novi Sad raid in 1942.

Serbian civilians were involved in saving thousands of Yugoslavian Jews during this period. Miriam Steiner-Aviezer, a researcher into Yugoslavian Jewry and a member of Yad Vashem&#x27;s Righteous Gentiles committee states: &quot;The Serbs saved many Jews. Contrary to their present image in the world, the Serbs are a friendly, loyal people who will not abandon their neighbors.&quot; As of 2017 Yad Vashem recognizes 135 Serbians as Righteous Among Nations, the highest of any Balkan country.

=== Bulgaria ===
Bulgaria joined the Axis powers in March 1941 and took part in the invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece. The Nazi-allied government of Bulgaria, led by Bogdan Filov, fully and actively assisted in the Holocaust in occupied areas. On Passover 1943, Bulgaria rounded up the great majority of Jews in Greece and Yugoslavia, transported them through Bulgaria, and handed them off to German transport to Treblinka, where almost all were murdered. The Nazi-allied government of Bulgaria deported a higher percentage of Jews (from the areas of Greece and the Republic of Macedonia) than did the German occupiers in the region. In Bulgarian-occupied Greece, the Bulgarian authorities arrested the majority of the Jewish population on Passover 1943. The territories of Greece, Macedonia and other nations occupied by Bulgaria during World War II were not considered Bulgarian—they were only administered by Bulgaria, but Bulgaria had no say as to the affairs of these lands.

The active participation of Bulgaria in the Holocaust however did not extend to its pre-war territory and after various protests by Archbishop Stefan of Sofia and the interference of Dimitar Peshev, the planned deportation of the Bulgarian Jews (about 50,000) was stopped. Deportation to the concentration camps was denied. Bulgaria was officially thanked by the government of Israel despite being an ally of Nazi Germany.

Dimitar Peshev was the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Bulgaria and Minister of Justice during World War II. He rebelled against the pro-Nazi cabinet and prevented the deportation of Bulgaria&#x27;s 48 000 Jews. He was aided by the strong opposition of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Although Peshev had been involved in various anti-Semitic legislation that was passed in Bulgaria during the early years of the War, the government&#x27;s decision to deport Bulgaria&#x27;s 48 000 Jews on 8 March 1943 was too much for Peshev. After being informed of the deportation, Peshev tried several times to see Prime Minister Bogdan Filov but the prime minister refused. Next, he went to see Interior Minister Petar Gabrovski insisting that he cancel the deportations. After much persuasion, Gabrovski finally called the governor of Kyustendil and instructed him to stop preparations for the Jewish deportations. By 5:30 p.m. on 9 March, the order was cancelled. After the war, Peshev was charged with anti-Semitism and anti-Communism by the Soviet courts, and sentenced to death. However, after an outcry from the Jewish community, his sentence was commuted to 15 years imprisonment, though released after just one year. His deeds went unrecognized after the war, as he lived in poverty in Bulgaria. It was not until 1973 that he was awarded the title of Righteous Among the Nations. He died the same year.

=== Portugal ===
Historians have estimated that up to one million refugees fled from the Nazis through Portugal during World War II, an impressive number considering the size of the country&#x27;s population at that time (circa 6 million). Portugal remained neutral within the overall objectives of the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance; and that astute policy under precarious conditions, made it possible for Portugal to contribute to the rescue of a large number of refugees. Portuguese Prime Minister António de Oliveira Salazar allowed all international Jewish organizations—HIAS, HICEM, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, World Jewish Congress, and Portuguese Jewish relief committees—to establish themselves in Lisbon. In 1944, in Hungary, risking their lives, the diplomats Carlos Sampaio Garrido and Carlos de Liz-Texeira Branquinho, coordinating with Salazar, also helped many Jews escape Nazis and their Hungarian allies. In June 1940, when Germany invaded France, Portuguese consul in Bordeaux, Aristides de Sousa Mendes issued visas, indiscriminately, to a population in panic, without asking previous authorizations from Lisbon, as he was supposed to. On 20 June, the British Embassy in Lisbon accused the Consul in Bordeaux of improperly charging money for issuing visas and Sousa Mendes was called to Lisbon. The number of visas issued by Sousa Mendes cannot be determined; a 1999 study by the Yad Vashem historian Dr. Avraham Milgram published by the Shoah Resource Center, International School for Holocaust Studies, asserts that there is a great difference between reality and the myth created by the generally cited numbers. Sousa Mendes never lost his title as he kept on being listed in the Portuguese Diplomatic Yearbook until 1954 and kept on receiving his full Consul salary, $1,593 Portuguese Escudos, until the day he died. Other Portuguese credited for saving Jews during the war are Professor Francisco Paula Leite Pinto and Moisés Bensabat Amzalak. A devoted Jew, and a Salazar supporter, Amzalak headed the Lisbon Jewish community for more than fifty years (from 1926 until 1978). Leite Pinto, General Manager of the Portuguese railways, together with Amzalak, organized several trains, coming from Berlin and other cities, loaded with refugees.

=== Spain ===
In Franco&#x27;s Spain, several diplomats contributed very actively to rescue Jews during the Holocaust. The two most prominent ones were Ángel Sanz Briz (the Angel of Budapest), who saved around five thousand Hungarian Jews by providing them Spanish passports, and Eduardo Propper de Callejón, who helped thousands of Jews to escape from France to Spain. Other diplomats with a relevant role were Bernardo Rolland de Miota (consul of Spain at Paris), José Rojas Moreno (ambassador at Bucharest), Miguel Ángel de Muguiro (diplomat at the embassy in Budapest), Sebastián Romero Radigales (consul at Athens), Julio Palencia Tubau, (diplomat at the embassy in Sofía), Juan Schwartz Díaz-Flores (consul at Vienna) and José Ruiz Santaella (diplomat at the embassy in Berlin).

=== Lithuania ===
According to the data available at Yad Vashem, by 1 January 2019, 904 rescuers of Jews in Lithuania were identified, whereas in the catalogue compiled by the Vilna Gaon State Jewish Museum, 2300 Lithuanians who rescued Jews are indicated, among them 159 members of clergy.

The Republic of Lithuania following the occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in September 1939, accepted and accommodated in the country numbers of Polish and Jewish refugees as well as soldiers of defeated Polish army. Part of these refugees were later saved from the Soviets (and eventually from Nazis) by L. P. J. de Decker, Dutch Ambassador to the Baltic States in Riga, 1940. He removed from the required visa text the need to have the Governor of Curacao&#x27;s approval to enter. This was a ruse to allow Jews to escape from Lithuania. He instructed, authorized honorary Dutch consul in Kovno, Lithuania Jan Zwartendijk to issue modified end visas to Jews in Lithuania. With the added help of Chiune Sempo Sugihara, Japanese consul-general in Kovno, thousands of Jews escaped from the Holocaust via Japan and then to Shanghai.

As well as in other countries rescuers from Lithuania came from different layers of society. The most iconic figures are librarian Ona Šimaitė, doctor Petras Baublys, writer Kazys Binkis and his wife journalist Sofija Binkienė, musician Vladas Varčikas, writer and translator Danutė Zubovienė (Čiurlionytė) and her husband Vladimiras Zubovas, doctor Elena Kutorgienė, aviator Vladas Drupas, doctor Pranas Mažylis, Catholic priest Juozapas Stakauskas, teacher Vladas Žemaitis, Catholic nun Maria Mikulska and others. In Šarnelė village (Plungė district) Straupiai family (Jonas and Bronislava Straupiai together with their neighbours Adolfina and Juozas Karpauskai) saved 26 people (9 families).

Citizens of Lithuania and foreign countries who rescue people on the territory of Lithuania and citizens of Lithuania abroad are awarded Life Saving Crosses. The President of Lithuania honors Jewish rescuers every year on the occasion of the National Memorial Day for the Genocide of Lithuanian Jews, which is marked on September 23 to commemorate the liquidation of the Vilna Ghetto on that day in 1943.

=== Albania ===

Unlike many other Eastern European countries under Nazi occupation, Albania—which has a mixed Muslim and Christian population and a tradition of tolerance—became a safe haven for Jews. At the end of 1938, Albania was the only remaining country in Europe that still issued visas to Jews through its embassy in Berlin. Following the Nazi occupation of Albania, the country refused to hand over its small Jewish population to the Germans, sometimes even providing Jewish families with forged documents. During the war, about 2,000 Jews sought refuge in Albania, and many of them took shelter in rural parts of the country where they were protected by the local population. At the end of the war, Albania&#x27;s Jewish population was greater than it was prior to the war, making it the only country in Europe where the Jewish population increased during World War II. Out of two thousand Jews in total, only five Albanian Jews perished at the hands of the Nazis. They were discovered by the Germans and subsequently deported to Pristina.

Between February and March in 1939, King Zog I of Albania granted asylum to 300 Jewish refugees before being overthrown by the Italian fascists in April the same year. When the Italians requisitioned the Albanian puppet government to expel its Jewish refugees, the Albanian leaders refused, and in the following years, 400 more Jewish refugees found sanctuary in Albania.

Refik Veseli was the first Albanian to be awarded the title Righteous Among the Nations, having declared afterwards that betraying the Jews &quot;would have disgraced his village and his family. At minimum his home would be destroyed and his family banished&quot;. On 21 July 1992, Mihal Lekatari, an Albanian partisan from Kavajë, was recognized as Righteous Among the Nations. Lekatari is noted for stealing blank identity papers from the municipality of Harizaj and distributing identity papers with Muslim names on them to Jewish refugees. In 1997, Albanian Shyqyri Myrto was honored for rescuing Jews, with the Anti-Defamation League&#x27;s &quot;Courage to Care Award&quot; presented to his son, Arian Myrto. In 2006, a plaque honoring the compassion and courage of Albania during the Holocaust was dedicated in The Holocaust Memorial Park in Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn, New York, with the Albanian ambassador to the United Nations in attendance.

During the war, some parts of Kosovo and Macedonia which were occupied by the Axis powers were annexed to Albania, and an estimated 600 Jews were captured in these territories, and consequently killed.

=== Finland ===
The government of Finland generally refused to deport Finnish Jews to Germany. It has been said that Finnish government officials told German envoys that &quot;Finland has no Jewish Problem&quot;. However, the Secret Police ValPo deported 8 Jews in 1942 who were refugees seeking asylum in Finland. Moreover, it seems highly likely that Finland deported Soviet POWs, among them a number of Jews. The majority of Finnish Jews, however, were protected by the government&#x27;s co-belligerence with Germany. Their men joined the Finnish army and fought on the front.

The most notable Finnish individual involved in aiding the Jews was Algoth Niska (1888–1954). Niska was a smuggler during the Finnish prohibition but had run into financial troubles after its end in 1932, so when Albert Amtmann, an Austrian-Jewish acquaintance, expressed his concerns over his people&#x27;s position in Europe, Niska quickly saw a business opportunity in smuggling Jews out of Germany. The modus operandi was quickly established. Niska would forge Finnish passports and Amtmann would acquire the customers, who with their new passports would be able to cross the border out of Germany. All in all, Niska falsified passports for 48 Jews during 1938 and earned 2,5 million Finnish marks ($890,000 or £600,000 in today&#x27;s money) selling them. Only three of the Jews are known to have survived the Holocaust while twenty were certainly caught. The fates of the other twenty-five are not known. Involved in the operation with Niska and Amtmann were Major Rafael Johannes Kajander, Axel Belewicz and Belewicz&#x27;s girlfriend Kerttu Ollikainen whose job was to steal the forms on which the passports were forged.

=== Italy ===
Despite Benito Mussolinis close alliance with Hitler, Italy did not adopt Nazism&#x27;s genocidal ideology towards the Jews. The Nazis were frustrated by the Italian forces&#x27; refusal to co-operate in the roundups of Jews, and no Jews were deported from Italy prior to the Nazi occupation of the country following the Italian capitulation in September 1943. In Italian-occupied Croatia, the Nazi envoy Siegfried Kasche advised Berlin that Italian forces had &quot;apparently been influenced&quot; by Vatican opposition to German anti-Semitism. As anti-Axis feeling grew in Italy, the use of Vatican Radio to broadcast papal disapproval of race murder and anti-Semitism angered the Nazis. Mussolini was overthrown in July 1943, and the Nazis moved to occupy Italy, commencing a round-up of Jews. Although thousands were caught, the great majority of Italy&#x27;s Jews were saved. As in other nations, Catholic networks were heavily engaged in rescue efforts.

In Fiume (northern Italy, today Croatian Rijeka), Giovanni Palatucci, after the promulgation of racial laws against Jews in 1938 and at the beginning of war in 1940, as chief of the Foreigners&#x27; Office, forged documents and visas to Jews threatened by deportation. He managed to destroy all documented records of some 5,000 Jewish refugees living in Fiume, issuing them false papers and providing them with funds. Palatucci then sent the refugees to a large internment camp in southern Italy protected by his uncle, Giuseppe Maria Palatucci, the Catholic Bishop of Campagna. Following the 1943 capitulation of Italy, Fiume was occupied by the Nazis. Palatucci remained as head of the police administration without real powers. He continued to clandestinely help Jews and maintain contact with the Resistance, until his activities were discovered by the Gestapo. The Swiss Consul to Trieste, a close friend of his, offered him a safe pass to Switzerland, but Giovanni Palatucci sent his young Jewish fiancée instead. Palatucci was arrested on 13 September 1944. He was condemned to death, but the sentence was later commuted to deportation to Dachau, where he died.

On 19 July 1944, the Gestapo rounded up the nearly 2000 Jewish inhabitants of the island of Rhodes, which had been governed by Italy since 1912. Of the approximately 2,000 Rhodesli Jews who were deported to Auschwitz and elsewhere, only 104 survived.

Giorgio Perlasca, who posed as the consul-general of Spain under the Spanish ambassador in Budapest, was able to put under his protection thousands of Jews and non-Jews destined to concentration camps.

The cycling champion Gino Bartali had hidden a Jewish family in his cellar and, according to one of the survivors, saved their lives in doing so. He also used his fame to carry messages and documents to the Italian Resistance and fugitive Jews. Bartali cycled from Florence through Tuscany, Umbria and Marche, many times traveling as far afield as Assisi, all the while wearing the racing jersey emblazoned with his name.

Calogero Marrone was the chief of the Civil Registry office in the municipality of Varese and issued hundreds of fake identity cards in order to save Jews and anti-fascists. He was arrested after an anonymous tip-off and died in the Dachau concentration camp.

Martin Gilbert wrote that, in October 1943, with the SS occupying Rome and determined to deport the city&#x27;s 5000 Jews, the Vatican clergy had opened the sanctuaries of the Vatican to all &quot;non-Aryans&quot; in need of rescue in an attempt to forestall the deportation. &quot;Catholic clergy in the city acted with alacrity&quot;, wrote Gilbert. &quot;At the Capuchin convent on the Via Siciliano, Father Benoit saved a large number of Jews by providing them with false identification papers [...] by the morning of October 16, a total of 4,238 Jews had been given sanctuary in the many monasteries and convents of Rome. A further 477 Jews had been given shelter in the Vatican and its enclaves.&quot; Gilbert credited the rapid rescue efforts of the Church with saving over four-fifths of Roman Jews.

Other Righteous Catholic rescuers in Italy included Elisabeth Hesselblad. She and two British women, Mother Riccarda Beauchamp Hambrough and Sister Katherine Flanagan have been beatified for reviving the Swedish Bridgettine Order of nuns and hiding scores of Jewish families in their convent. The churches, monasteries and convents of Assisi formed the Assisi Network and served as a safe haven for Jews. Gilbert credits the network established by Bishop Giuseppe Placido Nicolini and Abbott Rufino Niccaci of the Franciscan Monastery, with saving 300 people. Other Italian clerics honored by Yad Vashem include the theology professor Fr Giuseppe Girotti of Dominican Seminary of Turin, who saved many Jews before being arrested and sent to Dachau where he died in 1945; Fr Arrigo Beccari who protected around 100 Jewish children in his seminary and among local farmers in the village of Nonantola in Central Italy; and Don Gaetano Tantalo, a parish priest who sheltered a large Jewish family. Of Italy&#x27;s 44,500 Jews, some 7,680 were murdered in the Nazi Holocaust.

=== Vatican City State ===


In the 1930s, Pope Pius XI urged Mussolini to ask Hitler to restrain the anti-Semitic actions taking place in Germany. In 1937, the Pope issued the &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; () encyclical, in which he asserted the inviolability of human rights.
; Pius XII
Pope Pius XII succeeded Pius XI on the eve of war in 1939. He used diplomacy to aid the victims of the Holocaust, and directed the Church to provide discreet aid. His encyclicals such as &quot;Summi Pontificatus&quot; and &quot;Mystici corporis&quot; preached against racism—with specific reference to Jews: &quot;there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision&quot;. His 1942 Christmas radio address denounced the murder of &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of &quot;faultless&quot; people because of their &quot;nationality or race&quot;. The Nazis were furious and The Reich Security Main Office, responsible for the deportation of Jews, called him the &quot;mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals&quot;. Pius XII intervened to attempt to block Nazi deportations of Jews in various countries.

Following the capitulation of Italy, Nazi deportations of Jews to death camps began. Pius XII protested at diplomatic levels, while several thousand Jews found refuge in Catholic networks. On 27 June 1943, Vatican Radio broadcast a papal injunction: &quot;He who makes a distinction between Jews and other men is being unfaithful to God and is in conflict with God&#x27;s commands&quot;.

When the Nazis came to Rome in search of Jews, the Pope had already days earlier ordered the sanctuaries of the Vatican City be opened to all &quot;non-Aryans&quot; in need of refuge and according to Martin Gilbert, by the morning of 16 October, &quot;a total of 477 Jews had been given shelter in the Vatican and its enclaves, while another 4,238 had been given sanctuary in the many monasteries and convents of in Rome. Only 1,015 of Rome&#x27;s 6,730 Jews were seized that morning&quot;. Upon receiving news of the roundups on the morning of 16 October, the Pope immediately instructed Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione, to make a protest to the German ambassador. After the meeting, the ambassador gave orders for a halt to the arrests. Earlier, the Pope had helped the Jews of Rome by offering gold towards the 50 kg ransom demanded by the Nazis.

Other noted rescuers assisted by Pius were Pietro Palazzini Giovanni Ferrofino, Giovanni Palatucci, Pierre-Marie Benoit and others. When Archbishop Giovanni Montini (later Pope Paul VI) was offered an award for his rescue work by Israel, he said he had only been acting on the orders of Pius XII.

Pius&#x27; diplomatic representatives lobbied on behalf of Jews across Europe, including in Vichy France, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovakia, Germany itself and elsewhere. Many papal nuncios played important roles in the rescue of Jews, among them Giuseppe Burzio, the Vatican Chargé d&#x27;Affaires in Slovakia; Filippo Bernardini, Nuncio to Switzerland; and Angelo Roncalli, the Nuncio to Turkey. Angelo Rotta, the wartime Nuncio to Budapest and Andrea Cassulo, the Nuncio to Bucharest have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations.

Pius directly protested the deportations of Slovakian Jews to the Bratislava government from 1942. He made a direct intervention in Hungary to lobby for an end to Jewish deportations in 1944, and on 4 July, the Hungarian leader, Admiral Horthy, told Berlin that deportations of Jews must cease, citing protests by the Vatican, the King of Sweden and the Red Cross. The pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic Arrow Cross Party seized power in October, and a campaign of murder of the Jews commenced. The neutral powers led a major rescue effort and Pius&#x27; representative, Angelo Rotta, took the lead in establishing an &quot;international Ghetto&quot;, marked by the emblems of the Swiss, Swedish, Portuguese, Spanish and Vatican legations, and providing shelter for some 25,000 Jews.

In Rome, some 4,000 Italian Jews and escaped prisoners of war avoided deportation, many of them hidden in safe houses or evacuated from Italy by a resistance group organized by the Irish-born priest and Vatican official Hugh O&#x27;Flaherty. Msgr. O&#x27;Flaherty used his political connections to help secure sanctuary for dispossessed Jews. The wife of the Irish ambassador, Delia Murphy, assisted him.

=== Norway ===

During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, its Jewish community was subject to persecution and deported to extermination camps. Although at least 764 Jews in Norway were killed, over 1,000 were rescued with the help of non-Jewish Norwegians who risked their lives to smuggle the refugees out, typically to Sweden. , 67 of these individuals have been recognized by Yad Vashem as being &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot;. Yad Vashem has also recognized the Norwegian resistance movement collectively.

=== China ===
Ho Feng Shan – Chinese Consul in Vienna started to issue visas to Jews for Shanghai, part of which during this time was still under the control of the Republic of China, for humanitarian reasons. Between 1933 and 1941, the Chinese city of Shanghai under Japanese occupation, accepted unconditionally over 18,000 Jewish refugees escaping the Holocaust in Europe, a number greater than those taken in by Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and British India combined during World War II. After 1943, the occupying Nazi-aligned Japanese ghettoised the Jewish refugees in Shanghai into an area known as the Shanghai ghetto. Many of the Jewish refugees in Shanghai migrated to the United States and Israel after 1948 due to the Chinese Civil War (1946–1950).

=== Japan ===
The Japanese government ensured Jewish safety in China, Japan and Manchuria. Japanese Army General Hideki Tōjō received Jewish refugees in accordance with Japanese national policy and rejected German protest. Chiune Sugihara, Kiichiro Higuchi, and Fumimaro Konoe helped thousands of Jews escape the Holocaust from occupied Europe.

=== Bolivia ===
Between 1938 and 1941, around 20,000 Jews were given visas for Bolivia under an agricultural visa program. Although most moved on to the neighboring countries of Argentina, Uruguay and Chile, some stayed and created a Jewish Community in Bolivia.

=== The Philippines ===
In a notable humanitarian act, Manuel L. Quezon, the first Commonwealth of the Philippines, in cooperation with United States High Commissioner Paul V. McNutt, facilitated the entry into the Philippines of Jewish refugees fleeing fascist regimes in Europe, while taking on critics who were convinced by fascist propaganda that Jewish settlement is a threat to the country. Quezon and McNutt proposed to have 30,000 refugee families on Mindanao, and 40,000-50,000 refugees on Polillo. Quezon gave, as a 10-year loan to Manila&#x27;s Jewish Refugee Committee, land beside Quezon&#x27;s family home in Marikina. The land would house homeless refugees in Marikina Hall, dedicated on 23 April 1940.

== Villages helping Jews ==

*Yaruga, Ukraine
*Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, in the Haute-Loire département in France, which saved up to 5,000 Jews.
*In occupied Poland, among the hundreds of villages involved, some of the most notable included Głuchów near Łańcut with everyone engaged, as well as the villages of Główne, Ozorków, Borkowo near Sierpc, Dąbrowica near Ulanów, in Głupianka near Otwock, and Teresin near Chełm. In Cisie near Warsaw, 25 Poles were caught hiding Jews; all were killed and the village was burned to the ground as punishment. In Gołąbki, Jerzy and Irena Krępeć provided a hiding place for as many as 30 Jews on their farm and set up homeschooling for all children, Christian and Jewish together; their actions were &quot;an open secret in the village.&quot; Other villagers helped &quot;if only to provide a meal.&quot; Another farm couple, Alfreda and Bolesław Pietraszek, provided shelter for Jewish families consisting of 18 people in Ceranów near Sokołów Podlaski, and their neighbors brought food to those being rescued. In Markowa, where 17 Jews survived the war in hiding with their Christian neighbors, entire Polish family of Józef and Wiktoria Ulma including 6 children and prenatal child were shot dead by the Germans for hiding the Szall and Goldman families. Dorota and Antoni Szylar hid seven members of Weltz family. Julia and Józef Bar hid five members of Reisenbach family. Michal Bar hid Jakub Lorbenfeld; while Jan and Weronika Przybylak hid Jakub Einhorn.

*Tršice, Czech Republic, many people from this village helped hide a Jewish family; six of them were given the honorific of Righteous Among the Nations.
*Nieuwlande, Netherlands – during the war, this small village contained 117 inhabitants. Most households in the village and surrounding area cooperated to shelter Jews, thus making it difficult for anyone in the small village to betray their neighbors. Dozens of Jews were thus saved. Over 200 inhabitants have been honored by Yad Vashem.
*Moissac, France – There was a Jewish boarding home and orphanage in this town. When the mayor was told that the Nazis were coming, the older students would go camping for several days, the younger students were boarded with families in the area and told to be treated as members of their immediate family; the oldest students hid in the house. When it became too dangerous for the students to stay there any longer, the residents made sure that every student had a safe place to go to. If the students had to move again, the counsellors from the boarding house arranged for a new place and even escorted them to the new housing.
* The Portuguese cities of Figueira da Foz, Porto, Coimbra, Curia, Ericeira and Caldas da Rainha were assigned to house refugees. They were pleasant resorts with many available hotels. The refugees led totally ordinary lives. They were allowed to circulate freely within town limits, practice their religions, and enroll their children in local schools. &quot;Here we were given freedom of movement; we were allowed to go on outing and live as we wished&quot;, said Ben-Zwi Kalischer. Those times were captured on films that can be found at the Steven Spielberg Film and Video Archive.

<text>The Clackamas River is an approximately tributary of the Willamette River in northwestern Oregon, in the United States. Draining an area of about , the Clackamas flows through mostly forested and rugged mountainous terrain in its upper reaches, and passes agricultural and urban areas in its lower third.
The river rises in eastern Marion County, about east-southeast of Salem. The headwaters are on the slopes of Olallie Butte in the Mount Hood National Forest, about north of Mount Jefferson, at an elevation of in the Cascade Range. The Clackamas flows briefly north and then flows northwest through the mountains, passing through North Fork Reservoir and Estacada. It then emerges from the mountains southeast of Portland. It joins the Willamette near Oregon City and forms the boundary between Oregon City and Gladstone.

The Clackamas provides hydroelectric power and drinking water for some of the Portland metropolitan area, and it supports runs of Coho salmon, spring and fall Chinook salmon, and summer and winter steelhead. The river&#x27;s old-growth forests, its habitat for several species of birds, its healthy fish runs, and the recreational opportunities that it provides—such as fishing and whitewater rafting—led to the designation of more than half of the length of the river into the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System (NWSRS). This environment also allowed Native Americans to settle in the river&#x27;s basin as early as 10,000 years ago.

Regulation of the river began in 1905 with the Cazadero Dam. In 1912, the River Mill Dam intercepted wood and coarse sediment. Later dams at North Fork, Oak Grove, Stone Creek, and Timothy Lake also intercepted wood sediment on the lower river.

==Course==
The Clackamas River arises on the western slopes of the Cascade Range near Olallie Butte, between Mount Hood and Mount Jefferson in the Mount Hood National Forest. Flowing generally northwest and then west for about , it joins the Willamette River at Gladstone. The river falls nearly between its source and its mouth.

Originating in Marion County, the Clackamas River receives Squirrel Creek from the and Lemiti Creek from the before entering Clackamas County about from the mouth. Over its next , much of which is in a relatively level stretch known as Big Bottom, the river receives Cub Creek from the left, Sisi Creek from the right, then Hunter, Fawn, Rhododendron, and Lowe creeks, all from the left, followed by Wall, Pinhead, and Campbell creeks, all from the right, Kansas Creek from the left, and Cabin Creek and Lost Creek, both from the right. About from the mouth, Granite Creek enters from the left, and the river flows by Austin Hot Springs and Picnic Area. Shortly thereafter, Switch Creek enters from the right, and at about from the mouth, the Clackamas receives the Collawash River from the left. At the confluence, Two Rivers Picnic Area is on the left and Riverford Campground is on the right. About further downstream, Trout Creek enters from the left, and Riverside Campground is on the right.

Shortly thereafter, Tag Creek enters from the right, and at about from the mouth, the Clackamas River receives Oak Grove Fork Clackamas River from the right. From its confluence with Oak Grove Fork, the river runs close to Oregon Route 224 for most of the rest of its course. The highway is initially north and east of the river; that is, to its right. Over the next few miles, the river receives Big Creek, Sandstone Creek, and Whale Creek, all from the left, passes under Route 224, receives Cripple Creek, and passes under Route 224 again at the unincorporated community of Three Lynx. It receives Three Lynx Creek and Deer Creek from the right, Cat Creek from the left, and then Dinner Creek from the right as it enters a chute known as The Narrows about from the mouth. Soon Pup Creek enters from the left opposite the Sunstrip Campground before Roaring River enters from the right at about from the mouth. Near this point, Roaring River Campground is on the right. Shortly thereafter, Murphy Creek enters from the right, and Fish Creek enters from the left about from the mouth.

Over the next few miles, the river flows by Fish Creek Campground and Armstrong Campground, where it passes under Route 224. The river then passes Lockaby Campground and Carter Bridge Campground, where it passes under Route 224 again for the fourth and final time. From here to near Gladstone, the river flows south and west of the highway, which is on its right. Below Carter Bridge, the Clackamas River receives Hellion Creek from the left about from the mouth, passes Big Eddy Campground, receives Moore Creek from the right, and passes Lazy Bend Campground. Around from the mouth, the river receives the South Fork Clackamas River from the left opposite a landform known as Big Cliff. About later, the river enters North Fork Reservoir and soon receives the North Fork Clackamas River from the right. The Clackamas reaches the Faraday Dam, formerly known as the Cazadero Dam, about from the mouth and passes Faraday Lake, which is on the river&#x27;s left about later. Shortly thereafter, the Clackamas receives Lingleback Creek from the right, passes under Oregon Route 211 at Estacada, receives Dubois Creek from the left, and reaches River Mill Dam. It flows by Milo McIver State Park, south of the river between and from its mouth.

The river then flows by Bonnie Lure State Recreation Area, which lies to the north, and receives Eagle Creek from the right about from the mouth. It receives Goose Creek from the right before passing Barton County Park, which lies north of the river about downstream of Bonnie Lure. Deep Creek then enters from the right, Foster Creek from the left, and Richardson Creek from the right before the Clackamas River reaches Carver from the mouth. Here it receives Clear Creek from the left. Thereafter, Rock Creek enters from the right and Johnson Creek (not the Johnson Creek a few miles north of this one that empties into the Willamette River) from the left before the river passes under Interstate 205 and then Oregon Route 99E (McLoughlin Boulevard) between Oregon City to the south and Gladstone to the north. Clackamette Park lies to the left of the river&#x27;s last stretch as it enters the Willamette above its confluence with the Columbia River.

==History==

===Early inhabitants===

Before 1800, coniferous forests covered most of the watershed, and its streams supported big populations of salmon, steelhead, and other fish. Native Americans hunted, fished and gathered food and materials in the Clackamas River drainage as early as 10,000 years ago. By 2,000 to 3,000 years ago, they had established permanent settlements along the river&#x27;s lower floodplain. This was home to the Clackamas tribe, a subgroup of the Chinookan speakers who lived in the Columbia River valley from Celilo Falls to the Pacific Ocean. The Clackamas lands, reaching into the Cascade Range foothills, included the lower Willamette River from Willamette Falls at what became Oregon City to the confluence with the Columbia.

When Lewis and Clark visited the area in 1806, the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1,800 people living in 11 villages. Big villages lay near the falls and the mouth of the Clackamas River; others lay near Estacada and Eagle Creek. In the winter, families stayed in the villages, but at other times they used an extensive system of trails to visit seasonal camps. Epidemics of smallpox, malaria, and measles reduced the Clackamas population to 88 by 1851, and in 1855 the tribe surrendered its lands. Remnants of the tribe continued to travel from the Warm Springs Indian Reservation to fish and to gather berries near Estacada through the 1930s.

==Watershed==
The river basin, made up of 16 subwatersheds, drains an area of about . Most of the upper half of the basin lies within the rugged Mount Hood National Forest, managed by the U.S. Forest Service, while most of the lower watershed, partly agricultural and more heavily populated, is privately owned. Private timber companies own some of the land between the national forest and the lower watershed, and some of it is public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Roughly 72 percent of the watershed is on public land; 25 percent is private, and 3 percent is owned by Native American tribes. The watershed&#x27;s estimated population in 1995 was 63,702.

The Clackamas River supplies drinking water to more than 200,000 people. The City of Estacada, Clackamas River Water, the combined Oak Lodge Water District and Sunrise Water Authority, the South Fork Water Board, and the City of Lake Oswego all draw water from the Clackamas.

The Clackamas River Basin Council, with diverse representatives from over 20 stakeholder groups, fosters partnerships with organizations and private individuals to advocate natural resource conservation and preserve the watershed for future generations. Stakeholders include (but are not limited to) those involved in agriculture, education, fish and wildlife, hydropower, recreation, timber production, and government agencies.

The watershed is home to the last significant run of wild late-winter coho salmon in the Columbia Basin, which generally spawn on the main stem of the Clackamas above the North Fork Reservoir. The watershed also has one of only two remaining runs of spring chinook in the Willamette basin and supports a significant population of winter steelhead, cutthroat trout, and native lamprey.

==Wild and Scenic designation==
Forty-seven miles (76 km) of the Clackamas River, from Big Springs to Big Cliff, are federally protected as part of the NWSRS. Of these, are designated as &quot;scenic&quot; and as &quot;recreational&quot;. The protected portion of the Clackamas features five categories of resources that are considered to be &quot;outstandingly remarkable&quot;, defined by the NWSRS as having &quot;importance to the region or nation&quot;.

The five are opportunities for recreation such as white water rafting near the Portland metropolitan area; anadromous fish habitat supporting wild late winter coho, spring chinook, and winter steelhead; habitat for the federally threatened bald eagle and northern spotted owl; potential habitat for the threatened peregrine falcon; the forests of old-growth Douglas-fir along its banks; and historic importance. All of a tributary, the Roaring River, are designated as Wild and Scenic and are within the Roaring River Wilderness. Another of the South Fork Clackamas River were designated as Wild and Scenic along with the creation of the Clackamas Wilderness in 2009.

==Pollution==
In March 2008, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) released a report entitled &quot;Pesticide Occurrence and Distribution in the Lower Clackamas River Basin, Oregon, 2000–2005.&quot; It details pesticide pollution in the lower Clackamas River, its tributaries, and in pre- and post-treatment drinking water.

In all, 63 pesticide compounds: 33 herbicides, 15 insecticides, 6 fungicides, and 9 pesticide degradates were detected in samples collected during storm and nonstorm conditions. Fifty-seven pesticides or degradates were detected in the tributaries (mostly during storms), whereas fewer compounds (26) were detected in samples of source water from the lower mainstem Clackamas River, with fewest (15) occurring in drinking water.

The study concluded, &quot;Given their frequent and widespread occurrence, especially during storms, pesticides have the potential to affect aquatic life and the quality of drinking water derived from the lower river,&quot; and laid out areas for further study.

<text>Henry Kent Hewitt (February 11, 1887 – September 15, 1972) was the United States Navy commander of amphibious operations in North Africa and southern Europe through World War II. He was born in Hackensack, New Jersey and graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1907. His classmates included Patrick N. L. Bellinger, Willis W. Bradley, Robert C. Giffen, Jonas H. Ingram, George M. Courts, Claud A. Jones, and Raymond A. Spruance.

==Early career==
Hewitt served aboard in the Great White Fleet&#x27;s circumnavigation of the globe from 1907–1909. His sea duty continued as a division officer aboard and executive officer of the destroyer . In 1913 he was promoted to lieutenant, married Floride Louise Hunt (1887–1973), and began three years of shore duty as a Naval Academy mathematics instructor. He returned to sea in 1916 commanding the yacht in the Caribbean. Hewitt was awarded the Navy Cross commanding the destroyer escorting Atlantic convoys during World War I. His citation reads:

Hewitt was an instructor of electrical engineering and physics at the Naval Academy from 1919 to 1921 before returning to sea as gunnery officer aboard . After spending three years at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, he commanded Destroyer Division Twelve with the battle fleet from 1931 to 1933. He then chaired the Naval Academy mathematics department for three years while the Naval Academy developed the Keuffel &amp; Esser Log Log Trig slide rule. He returned to sea commanding the cruiser and transported President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the Pan-American Conference at Buenos Aires following the 1936 elections.

==Flag rank during World War II==

Hewitt was promoted to rear admiral in 1939, and commanded Atlantic Fleet Task Groups in neutrality patrols and convoys from 1941 until becoming Commander, Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet, in April 1942. This force, also called Task Force 34, became the U.S. component of the Operation Torch landings in November 1942. Hewitt was then assigned as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces, Northwest Africa Waters or COMNAVNAW. His flagships included while he commanded American naval forces at the Naval Battle of Casablanca, while he commanded the western task force during the invasion of Sicily, and while he commanded all Allied amphibious forces during the invasion of Italy and later Anzio landings and invasion of southern France.

Hewitt was awarded both the Army and Navy Distinguished Service Medals for his part in the invasion of North Africa. The Navy Distinguished Service Medal citation reads:

The Army Distinguished Service Medal citation reads:

Hewitt was awarded a second Navy Cross for his part in the invasion of Italy. The citation reads:

Hewitt was awarded a second Army Distinguished Service Medal for his part in the invasion of southern France. The citation reads:

Hewitt was awarded a second Navy Distinguished Service Medal as commander of the United States Eighth Fleet for the last two years of the war. The citation reads:

==Post-war==
Hewitt remained in this post until 1945, when he chaired a Pearl Harbor investigation. Following World War II, he commanded U.S. Naval Forces Europe, advised the Naval War College, and served as a Navy representative to the United Nations. Hewitt retired from active duty to Orwell, Vermont in 1949. and died at Middlebury, Vermont in 1972. was named in his honor.

<text>The Stagnone Lagoon is a part of Mediterranean Sea in front of Marsala City (Province of Trapani, autonomous region of Sicily); the Lagoon is delimited by an island called Isola Lunga (formerly stinco di Capra) because of its geographical long form.

Inside the Lagoon there are the famous Mozia island and another small island
called Santa Maria.

The water level in the lagoon varies from a few centimetres to a maximum of 2 metres. A peculiarity of the Stagnone is that, during summer, the water is always hot due to its low level and the lagoon conformation.

<text>In mathematics, a Sobolev space is a vector space of functions equipped with a norm that is a combination of &quot;Lp&quot;-norms of the function together with its derivatives up to a given order. The derivatives are understood in a suitable weak sense to make the space complete, i.e. a Banach space. Intuitively, a Sobolev space is a space of functions possessing sufficiently many derivatives for some application domain, such as partial differential equations, and equipped with a norm that measures both the size and regularity of a function.

Sobolev spaces are named after the Russian mathematician Sergei Sobolev. Their importance comes from the fact that weak solutions of some important partial differential equations exist in appropriate Sobolev spaces, even when there are no strong solutions in spaces of continuous functions with the derivatives understood in the classical sense.

==Motivation==

In this section and throughout the article formula_1 is an open subset of formula_2

There are many criteria for smoothness of mathematical functions. The most basic criterion may be that of continuity. A stronger notion of smoothness is that of differentiability (because functions that are differentiable are also continuous) and a yet stronger notion of smoothness is that the derivative also be continuous (these functions are said to be of class formula_3 — see Differentiability classes). Differentiable functions are important in many areas, and in particular for differential equations. In the twentieth century, however, it was observed that the space formula_3 (or formula_5, etc.) was not exactly the right space to study solutions of differential equations. The Sobolev spaces are the modern replacement for these spaces in which to look for solutions of partial differential equations.

Quantities or properties of the underlying model of the differential equation are usually expressed in terms of integral norms. A typical example is measuring the energy of a temperature or velocity distribution by an formula_6-norm. It is therefore important to develop a tool for differentiating Lebesgue space functions.

The integration by parts formula yields that for every formula_7, where formula_8 is a natural number, and for all infinitely differentiable functions with compact support formula_9

:formula_10

where formula_11 is a multi-index of order formula_12 and we are using the notation:

:formula_13

The left-hand side of this equation still makes sense if we only assume formula_14 to be locally integrable. If there exists a locally integrable function formula_15, such that

:formula_16

then we call formula_15 the weak formula_11-th partial derivative of formula_14. If there exists a weak formula_11-th partial derivative of formula_14, then it is uniquely defined almost everywhere, and thus it is uniquely determined as an element of a Lebesgue space. On the other hand, if formula_7, then the classical and the weak derivative coincide. Thus, if formula_15 is a weak formula_11-th partial derivative of formula_14, we may denote it by formula_26.

For example, the function

:formula_27

is not continuous at zero, and not differentiable at −1, 0, or 1. Yet the function

:formula_28

satisfies the definition for being the weak derivative of formula_29 which then qualifies as being in the Sobolev space formula_30 (for any allowed formula_31, see definition below).

The Sobolev spaces formula_32 combine the concepts of weak differentiability and Lebesgue norms.

==Sobolev spaces with integer &quot;k&quot;==

===One-dimensional case===
In the one-dimensional case the Sobolev space formula_33 for formula_34 is defined as the subset of functions formula_35 in formula_36 such that formula_35 and its weak derivatives up to order formula_8 have a finite norm. As mentioned above, some care must be taken to define derivatives in the proper sense. In the one-dimensional problem it is enough to assume that the formula_39-th derivative formula_40 is differentiable almost everywhere and is equal almost everywhere to the Lebesgue integral of its derivative (this excludes irrelevant examples such as Cantor&#x27;s function).

With this definition, the Sobolev spaces admit a natural norm,

:formula_41

One can extend this to the case formula_42, with the norm then defined using the essential supremum by

:formula_43

Equipped with the norm formula_44 becomes a Banach space. It turns out that it is enough to take only the first and last in the sequence, i.e., the norm defined by

:formula_45

is equivalent to the norm above (i.e. the induced topologies of the norms are the same).

====The case ====
Sobolev spaces with are especially important because of their connection with Fourier series and because they form a Hilbert space. A special notation has arisen to cover this case, since the space is a Hilbert space:

:formula_46

The space formula_47 can be defined naturally in terms of Fourier series whose coefficients decay sufficiently rapidly, namely,

:formula_48

where formula_49 is the Fourier series of formula_50 and formula_51 denotes the 1-torus. As above, one can use the equivalent norm

:formula_52

Both representations follow easily from Parseval&#x27;s theorem and the fact that differentiation is equivalent to multiplying the Fourier coefficient by formula_53.

Furthermore, the space formula_47 admits an inner product, like the space formula_55 In fact, the formula_47 inner product is defined in terms of the formula_6 inner product:

:formula_58

The space formula_47 becomes a Hilbert space with this inner product.

====Other examples====
In one dimension, some other Sobolev spaces permit a simpler description. For example, formula_60 is the space of absolutely continuous functions on (or rather, equivalence classes of functions that are equal almost everywhere to such), while formula_61 is the space of bounded Lipschitz functions on , for every interval . However, these properties are lost or not as simple for functions of more than one variable.

All spaces formula_62 are (normed) algebras, i.e. the product of two elements is once again a function of this Sobolev space, which is not the case for formula_63 (E.g., functions behaving like |&quot;x&quot;|−1/3 at the origin are in formula_64 but the product of two such functions is not in formula_6).

===Multidimensional case===
The transition to multiple dimensions brings more difficulties, starting from the very definition. The requirement that formula_40 be the integral of formula_67 does not generalize, and the simplest solution is to consider derivatives in the sense of distribution theory.

A formal definition now follows. Let formula_68 The Sobolev space formula_32 is defined to be the set of all functions formula_35 on formula_1 such that for every multi-index formula_11 with formula_73 the mixed partial derivative

:formula_74

exists in the weak sense and is in formula_75 i.e.

:formula_76

That is, the Sobolev space formula_32 is defined as

:formula_78

The natural number formula_8 is called the order of the Sobolev space formula_80

There are several choices for a norm for formula_80 The following two are common and are equivalent in the sense of equivalence of norms:

:formula_82

and

:formula_83

With respect to either of these norms, formula_32 is a Banach space. For formula_85 is also a separable space. It is conventional to denote formula_86 by formula_87 for it is a Hilbert space with the norm formula_88.

====Approximation by smooth functions====
It is rather hard to work with Sobolev spaces relying only on their definition. It is therefore interesting to know that by the Meyers–Serrin theorem a function formula_89 can be approximated by smooth functions. This fact often allows us to translate properties of smooth functions to Sobolev functions. If formula_31 is finite and formula_1 is open, then there exists for any formula_89 an approximating sequence of functions formula_93 such that:

:formula_94

If formula_1 has Lipschitz boundary, we may even assume that the formula_96 are the restriction of smooth functions with compact support on all of formula_2

====Examples====

In higher dimensions, it is no longer true that, for example, formula_98 contains only continuous functions. For example, formula_99 where formula_100 is the unit ball in three dimensions. For formula_101, the space formula_32 will contain only continuous functions, but for which formula_8 this is already true depends both on formula_31 and on the dimension. For example, as can be easily checked using spherical polar coordinates for the function formula_105 defined on the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional unit ball we have:

:formula_106

Intuitively, the blow-up of &quot;f&quot; at 0 &quot;counts for less&quot; when &quot;n&quot; is large since the unit ball has &quot;more outside and less inside&quot; in higher dimensions.

====Absolutely continuous on lines (ACL) characterization of Sobolev functions====
Let formula_107 If a function is in formula_108 then, possibly after modifying the function on a set of measure zero, the restriction to almost every line parallel to the coordinate directions in formula_109 is absolutely continuous; what&#x27;s more, the classical derivative along the lines that are parallel to the coordinate directions are in formula_110 Conversely, if the restriction of formula_35 to almost every line parallel to the coordinate directions is absolutely continuous, then the pointwise gradient formula_112 exists almost everywhere, and formula_35 is in formula_114 provided formula_115 In particular, in this case the weak partial derivatives of formula_35 and pointwise partial derivatives of formula_35 agree almost everywhere. The ACL characterization of the Sobolev spaces was established by Otto M. Nikodym (1933); see .

A stronger result holds when formula_118 A function in formula_114 is, after modifying on a set of measure zero, Hölder continuous of exponent formula_120 by Morrey&#x27;s inequality. In particular, if formula_121 and formula_1 has Lipschitz boundary, then the function is Lipschitz continuous.

==== Functions vanishing at the boundary ====
The Sobolev space formula_123 is also denoted by formula_124 It is a Hilbert space, with an important subspace formula_125 defined to be the closure of the infinitely differentiable functions compactly supported in formula_1 in formula_124 The Sobolev norm defined above reduces here to

:formula_128

When formula_1 has a regular boundary, formula_125 can be described as the space of functions in formula_131 that vanish at the boundary, in the sense of traces (see below). When formula_132 if formula_133 is a bounded interval, then formula_134 consists of continuous functions on formula_135 of the form

:formula_136

where the generalized derivative formula_137 is in formula_138 and has 0 integral, so that formula_139

When formula_1 is bounded, the Poincaré inequality states that there is a constant formula_141 such that:

:formula_142

When formula_1 is bounded, the injection from formula_125 to formula_145 is compact. This fact plays a role in the study of the Dirichlet problem, and in the fact that there exists an orthonormal basis of formula_146 consisting of eigenvectors of the Laplace operator (with Dirichlet boundary condition).

==Traces==
Sobolev spaces are often considered when investigating partial differential equations. It is essential to consider boundary values of Sobolev functions. If formula_147, those boundary values are described by the restriction formula_148 However, it is not clear how to describe values at the boundary for formula_149 as the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional measure of the boundary is zero. The following theorem resolves the problem:
&quot;Tu&quot; is called the trace of &quot;u&quot;. Roughly speaking, this theorem extends the restriction operator to the Sobolev space formula_114 for well-behaved Ω. Note that the trace operator &quot;T&quot; is in general not surjective, but for 1 &lt; &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞ it maps continuously onto the Sobolev–Slobodeckij space formula_151

Intuitively, taking the trace costs 1/&quot;p&quot; of a derivative. The functions &quot;u&quot; in &quot;W&quot;1,p(Ω) with zero trace, i.e. &quot;Tu&quot; = 0, can be characterized by the equality

:formula_152

where

:formula_153

In other words, for Ω bounded with Lipschitz boundary, trace-zero functions in formula_114 can be approximated by smooth functions with compact support.

==Sobolev spaces with non-integer &quot;k&quot;==

===Bessel potential spaces===
For a natural number &quot;k&quot; and one can show (by using Fourier multipliers) that the space formula_155 can equivalently be defined as

:formula_156

with the norm

:formula_157

This motivates Sobolev spaces with non-integer order since in the above definition we can replace &quot;k&quot; by any real number &quot;s&quot;. The resulting spaces

:formula_158

are called Bessel potential spaces (named after Friedrich Bessel). They are Banach spaces in general and Hilbert spaces in the special case &quot;p&quot; = 2.

For formula_159 is the set of restrictions of functions from formula_160 to Ω equipped with the norm

:formula_161

Again, &quot;Hs,p&quot;(Ω) is a Banach space and in the case &quot;p&quot; = 2 a Hilbert space.

Using extension theorems for Sobolev spaces, it can be shown that also &quot;Wk,p&quot;(Ω) = &quot;Hk,p&quot;(Ω) holds in the sense of equivalent norms, if Ω is domain with uniform &quot;Ck&quot;-boundary, &quot;k&quot; a natural number and . By the embeddings

:formula_162

the Bessel potential spaces formula_160 form a continuous scale between the Sobolev spaces formula_164 From an abstract point of view, the Bessel potential spaces occur as complex interpolation spaces of Sobolev spaces, i.e. in the sense of equivalent norms it holds that
:formula_165
where:
:formula_166

===Sobolev–Slobodeckij spaces===

Another approach to define fractional order Sobolev spaces arises from the idea to generalize the Hölder condition to the &quot;Lp&quot;-setting. For formula_167 and formula_168 the Slobodeckij seminorm (roughly analogous to the Hölder seminorm) is defined by

:formula_169

Let be not an integer and set formula_170. Using the same idea as for the Hölder spaces, the Sobolev–Slobodeckij space formula_171 is defined as
:formula_172

It is a Banach space for the norm
:formula_173

If formula_1 is suitably regular in the sense that there exist certain extension operators, then also the Sobolev–Slobodeckij spaces form a scale of Banach spaces, i.e. one has the continuous injections or embeddings

:formula_175

There are examples of irregular Ω such that formula_114 is not even a vector subspace of formula_171 for 0 &lt; &quot;s&quot; &lt; 1 (see Example 9.1 of )

From an abstract point of view, the spaces formula_171 coincide with the real interpolation spaces of Sobolev spaces, i.e. in the sense of equivalent norms the following holds:

:formula_179

Sobolev–Slobodeckij spaces play an important role in the study of traces of Sobolev functions. They are special cases of Besov spaces.

The constant arising in the characterization of the fractional Sobolev space formula_171 can be characterized through the Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu formula:
:formula_181
and the condition 
:formula_182
characterizes those functions of formula_183 that are in the first-order Sobolev space formula_184.

== Extension operators ==

If formula_1 is a domain whose boundary is not too poorly behaved (e.g., if its boundary is a manifold, or satisfies the more permissive &quot;cone condition&quot;) then there is an operator &quot;A&quot; mapping functions of formula_1 to functions of formula_109 such that:

# &quot;Au&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for almost every &quot;x&quot; in formula_1 and
# formula_189 is continuous for any 1 ≤ &quot;p&quot; ≤ ∞ and integer &quot;k&quot;.

We will call such an operator &quot;A&quot; an extension operator for formula_190

===Case of &quot;p&quot; = 2===

Extension operators are the most natural way to define formula_191 for non-integer &quot;s&quot; (we cannot work directly on formula_1 since taking Fourier transform is a global operation). We define formula_191 by saying that formula_194 if and only if formula_195 Equivalently, complex interpolation yields the same formula_191 spaces so long as formula_1 has an extension operator. If formula_1 does not have an extension operator, complex interpolation is the only way to obtain the formula_191 spaces.

As a result, the interpolation inequality still holds.

=== Extension by zero ===

Like above, we define formula_200 to be the closure in formula_191 of the space formula_202 of infinitely differentiable compactly supported functions. Given the definition of a trace, above, we may state the following

If formula_203 we may define its extension by zero formula_204 in the natural way, namely

:formula_205

For its extension by zero,

:formula_206

is an element of formula_207 Furthermore,

:formula_208

In the case of the Sobolev space &quot;W&quot;1,p(Ω) for , extending a function &quot;u&quot; by zero will not necessarily yield an element of formula_209 But if Ω is bounded with Lipschitz boundary (e.g. ∂Ω is &quot;C&quot;1), then for any bounded open set O such that Ω⊂⊂O (i.e. Ω is compactly contained in O), there exists a bounded linear operator

:formula_210

such that for each formula_211 a.e. on Ω, &quot;Eu&quot; has compact support within O, and there exists a constant &quot;C&quot; depending only on &quot;p&quot;, Ω, O and the dimension &quot;n&quot;, such that

:formula_212

We call formula_213 an extension of formula_14 to formula_2

==Sobolev embeddings==
It is a natural question to ask if a Sobolev function is continuous or even continuously differentiable. Roughly speaking, sufficiently many weak derivatives (i.e. large &quot;k&quot;) result in a classical derivative. This idea is generalized and made precise in the Sobolev embedding theorem.

Write formula_216 for the Sobolev space of some compact Riemannian manifold of dimension &quot;n&quot;. Here &quot;k&quot; can be any real number, and 1 ≤ &quot;p&quot; ≤ ∞. (For &quot;p&quot; = ∞ the Sobolev space formula_62 is defined to be the Hölder space &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;,α where &quot;k&quot; = &quot;n&quot; + α and 0 &lt; α ≤ 1.) The Sobolev embedding theorem states that if formula_218 and formula_219 then

:formula_220

and the embedding is continuous. Moreover, if formula_221 and formula_222 then the embedding is completely continuous (this is sometimes called Kondrachov&#x27;s theorem or the Rellich–Kondrachov theorem). Functions in formula_223 have all derivatives of order less than &quot;m&quot; continuous, so in particular this gives conditions on Sobolev spaces for various derivatives to be continuous. Informally these embeddings say that to convert an &quot;Lp&quot; estimate to a boundedness estimate costs 1/&quot;p&quot; derivatives per dimension.

There are similar variations of the embedding theorem for non-compact manifolds such as formula_109 . Sobolev embeddings on formula_109 that are not compact often have a related, but weaker, property of cocompactness.

<text>Dur-Kurigalzu (modern &quot;&quot; in Baghdad Governorate, Iraq) was a city in southern Mesopotamia, near the confluence of the Tigris and Diyala rivers, about west of the center of Baghdad. It was founded by a Kassite king of Babylon, Kurigalzu I (died c. 1375 BC) and was abandoned after the fall of the Kassite dynasty (c. 1155 BC). The city was of such importance that it appeared on toponym lists in the funerary temple of the Egyptian pharaoh, Amenophis III (c. 1351 BC) at Kom el-Hettan&quot;. The prefix &quot;Dur&quot; is an Akkadian term meaning &quot;fortress of&quot;, while the Kassite royal name &quot;Kurigalzu&quot; is believed to have meant &quot;shepherd of the Kassites&quot;. The tradition of naming new towns Dur dates back to the Old Babylonian period with an example being Dūr-Ammī-ditāna. The city contained a ziggurat and temples dedicated to Mesopotamian gods, as well as a royal palace which covered 420,000 square meters.

The ziggurat at Aqar Quf, standing to a height of about , has been a very visible ancient monument for centuries. For camel caravans and modern road traffic, the ziggurat has served as a signal of the near approach to Baghdad. Because of Aqar Quf&#x27;s easy accessibility and close proximity to the city of Baghdad, it has been one of Iraq&#x27;s most visited and best-known sites. The ziggurat was often confused with the Tower of Babel by Western visitors to the area from the 17th century onwards.

==History==
The town of Dur Kurigalzu was founded by the Kassite King Kurigalzu I in the early 14th century BC and is situated along an east–west-trending limestone ridge between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. Until the last century, the adjacent Aqar Quf depression would have been inundated with flood water part of the year. This site had access to fresh water from the Euphrates by means of the Isa Canal, known as the Patti-Enlil Canal in ancient times. The city functioned as the capital of Babylonia during the reign of Kurigalzu, and either as the capital or at least an important city during the period after. It was occupied continuously until the fall of the Kassite Dynasty in the 12th century BC when it was largely abandoned. The temple area, at least, was known to be active in the 7th century BC and in the Neo-Babylonian period. Up until recently (mostly between the 9th and 14th centuries AD), there have been smaller occupations at parts of Aqar Quf, with areas of the site being used for burials and for Arab settlement. It has been suggested that in earlier times the site was named Esâ.

===Ziggurat===
The Ziggurat of Dur-Kurigalzu, built in the early 14th century BC by Kurigalzu I, is located in the city&#x27;s western area and is devoted to the chief Babylonian God Enlil, who Sumerians believed to govern over wind, air, earth, and storm.

The ziggurat&#x27;s base measures 69m x 67m and it was constructed of large, well-tempered liben with many stamped baked bricks incorporated into the structure, bearing the name of Kurigalzu and his dedication of the temple E-U-GAL to Enlil. Facing the front, the Ziggurat can be approached from three main staircases leading up to the first level. Standing upright on the level withholds a terraced compound, built by layers of receding levels. At its core, there are consistent sun-dried square bricks with reed mats placed in every seven layers of brick to help hold the structure altogether. An axial flight of steps was discovered running outwards from the center of the side of the ziggurat towards the temple-complex and was built of solid kiln-baked brick set in bitumen.

==Archaeology==
In Kassite times the area was defined by a large wall that enclosed about . The wall, originally built by Kurigalzu I, was later rebuilt by Kurigalzu II (c. 1332—1308 BC). The site has several defined areas, Mound A (100 meters south of the ziggurat), Tell Ahmar, Tell Abu Shijar, Tell al-Abyad, and a private housing area. The main elements, ziggurat, palaces, etc. are all within the city wall. The currently known structures of the site consist of nine temples (T1 to T9), with T1 being the ziggurat and associated temple to Enlil, three palaces (P1 to T3), and five housing areas (H1 to H5)

The site was visited by Bengt Bengtsson Oxenstierna in 1616. Agar Quf first appeared on a modern map by Edward Ives in 1773. The site was then described by Claudius James Rich in 1811. Aqar Quf (referred to then as Akerkuf, Agger Koof, or Akar-kuf) was visited and examined in 1837 by Francis Rawdon Chesney. The name of Dur-Kurigalzu was identified by Henry Rawlinson in the mid-19th century.

Excavations were conducted from 1942 through 1945, by Taha Baqir and Seton Lloyd in a joint excavation by the Iraqi Directorate-General of Antiquities and the British School of Archaeology in Iraq. Over 100 cuneiform tablets of the Kassite period were recovered, now in the Iraq Museum. Some were date-able to the reigns of Burna-Buriash II and Kashtiliash IV. They also showed that two of the palaces were named the Palace of the Mountain Sheep and the Palace of the Stag. A kudurru (IM 49991) dated to year five of Kassite ruler Nazi-Maruttash was also found. During the excavation, 5 fragments of a larger-than-life-size statue were discovered. They contain the longest yet found Kassite Sumerian inscriptions.
A baked brick pavement (T5) around two kilometers northwest of Tell al-Abyad was found to be covered with hundreds of broken terracotta figurines dedicated to the god Gula. Bricks found in situ were dated to the reign of Kassite ruler Nazi-Maruttash. The excavations included the ziggurat, three temples, and part of the palace of Dur-Kurigalzu II.
In the early 1960s and from 1968 to 1975 the Iraqi Directorate-General of Antiquities continued to do some excavation around the ziggurat as part of a restoration project under Saddam Hussein The three excavated areas are the mound of Aqar Quf (including the ziggurat and large temple), a public building (approximately to the west), and Tell al-Abyad where a large palace was partially uncovered (about to the south-west). Several burned cuneiform tables dated to the reign of Marduk-apla-iddina I were found there. As part of a temple restoration a pottery jar was found containing 220 Islamic silver dirhem coins from the Ilkhanid period.

Excavations continued between 1977 and 1980, led by Suphi Anwar Rashid and Amire al-Khayyat, in the temple area. Paving and wall bricks dedicated to Enlil and Ninlil were found as well as a Kassite double jar burial, an inscribed eyestone for Enlil dedicated by Kurigalzu, and two female figurines in ivory.

Another area within Dur-Kurigalzu, Tell Abu Shijar, was excavated by Iraqi archaeologists in 1992, 1993, and 2001 finding mainly late Kassite and lesser Parthian/Sassanian remains. Painted plaster wall fragments, similar to those found at Tell al-Abyad, were recovered as well as a worn cylinder seal and thirteen cuneiform clay tablets. The tablets were unread (and may be lost) but 3 were noted to have dates of the Kassite king Nazi-Maruttash (1307—1282 BC). The site lies 1 kilometer west of the ziggurat and 500 meters southwest of Tell al-Abyad being about 6 meters in height with only the central 120-meter by 150-meter mound undisturbed by modern activity.

In the mid-1990s an Italian team conducted a photogrammatic survey of the ziggurrat.

== Wall paintings at &quot;Tell al-Abyad&quot; ==

Some of the most significant finds of Kassite period artwork are found in the main palatial complex (P1) and its surrounding complexes (located at &quot;Tell al-Abyad&quot;) of Dur-Kurigalzu about 1000 meters northwest of the main ziggurat. The recurring motifs of the artwork found on all four levels of the palatial complex are representational and contain human processional scenes and clusters of fruit; there are also geometric designs that contain parallel bands, chevrons, and rosettes. The processional scenes date to the time of the last Kassite king Marduk-apla-iddina I. The representational motif of human figures is also some of the only surviving instances of human representation in artwork from the Kassite period and gives an indication of the artistic technique utilized at the time. The majority of large, upright wall paintings can be found in the internal rooms of the palace that would have functioned as reception or public rooms. The highest concentration of this wall painting type can be found in Unit H sector on Level II named also &#x27;PaintedPalace&#x27;, dating to the reign of Kaštiliaš IV.

Another wall painting type is also found along recesses of the courtyards and between rooms and contains the same motifs of floral and geometric designs and processional scenes that Yoko Tomabechi states function to &#x27;brighten the doorways and the inner rooms&#x27;. The colours utilised in these paintings are &#x27;red, cobalt-blue, dark-blue, yellow, white and black&#x27;. Much of the palatial complex and its artwork inside remain unexcavated and need further exploration.

== Temples ==
At the base of the ziggurat steps, is a pavement that leads to one of the four excavated temples, E-U-GAL. This would also continue to lead into a court and several smaller rooms adjoining it. The other three temples are E-GASAN-AN-TA-GAL, E-SAG-DINGIR-RI-E-NE, and E-SAG-DINGIR-E-NE. King Kurigalzu appears to have built all these temples under great patronage. The entire complex mostly has liben walls that are thickly covered with plaster and may bear traces of fire, which are thought to reflect attempts in destroying the site in the past.

=== E-U-GAL ===
E-U-GAL, which is likely to mean &quot;The House of the Great Lord,&quot; is believed to be the most important temple of Dur Kurigalzu. This name could also refer to the entire temple complex or the entire site as the text was engraved into bricks in all three temples and in the ziggurat.

=== E-GASAN-AN-TA-GAL ===

The name of the temple is a combination of &quot;The House of the Lady&quot; and words meaning &quot;high&quot;, &quot;firm&quot;, or &quot;great&quot;. Inside this temple is a small staircase that leads up to an altar, subsidiary courts, and a room that appears to be the kitchen where a raised rectangular compartment was excavated and assumed to be an oven.

=== Tower ===
Between E-GASAN-AN-TA-GAL and E-U-GAL is a massive ruin, excavated to be 17 meters tall, that could be the foundation of a tower that was weathered away by floods. This structure was also made with liben and faced with baked bricks.

==Current status==
For 16 seasons in the 1960s and 1970s the Iraqi government did conservation and restoration work at the site. Unfortunately the modern restoration work resulted in significant damage to the original construction it overlaid as it did at Babylon. Aqar Quf is currently suffering environmental damage and urban encroachment. Natural factors like rain and standing groundwater have contributed to the erosion of the ziggurat and damage to the ruins, especially along the southwest side. As a result of this damage, the ziggurat is in danger of further deterioration as well as collapse if preventive measures are not taken. The suburbs and industrial areas of Baghdad also continue developing near the site. Currently, there is an encroachment of modern construction along some stretches of the enclosure wall. There is also agricultural encroachment along the enclosure wall, especially on the southwest side. Iraqi Army maneuvers, involving trenches, did some damage to the site in the 1980s.

The ziggurat suffered damage as a result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq when the site was abandoned and looted during the security breakdown and chaos that followed the U.S. military&#x27;s overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Little is left of the modern administration building, museum, event stage, and restaurant that once served the picnickers and students who visited the site before the war. Local government officials and the U.S. military charged with security in the area have been working to create a renovation plan. Since mid-2008, local officials have drafted plans to rebuild the historic site, but support from the Iraq Ministry of History and Ruins has not materialized.

==Tell Basmaya==
The site of Tell Basmaya lies about seven kilometers southeast of modern Baghdad at the Tigris-Diyala river junction and just to the northeast of ancient Dur-Kurigalzu. It covers an area of about 4 hectares and consists of eight mounds (ranging in height from 1 to 4.5 meters). All of the mound have now been destroyed by modern development. It was first identified in a 1957-1958 regional survey by Robert Adams (site #562). It was worked for two seasons from 2013 to 2014 by a Iraqi Board of Antiquities and Heritage, led by Taha K. Abod, in a program of rescue archaeology before the area was developed. Excavation occurred at four (5, 6, 7, 8) of the mounds only two of which (6 and 7) showed signs of occupation. On mound seven (0.96 hectares in area, 4.h meters in height eight sizable (five with 5 rooms, three with 13 rooms, one with 16 rooms) buildings were excavated. Ten fragmentary cuneiform tablets were found in those buildings with two tablets bearing year names (14th and 17th) of Kassite ruler Kadashman-Turgu (c. 1281–1264 BC) along with five cylinder seals and one sealing. One seal, of fossilized coral, contains the inscription &quot;Marduk, have mercy on him&quot;. Small finds included metal daggers and chisels and a number of faience objects, including a face mask and three chariot fittings. Forty four intramural and extramural graves were found including a brick tomb and a vaulted tomb. Some late Sassanian and early Arabic period remains were found including many Aramaic incantation bowls.

<doc id="611982" wikidata="Q192131" url="?curid=611982" title="Giuseppe Meazza">
<text>Giuseppe Meazza (; 23 August 1910 – 21 August 1979) was an Italian football manager and player. Throughout his career, he played mainly for Inter Milan in the 1930s, scoring 284 goals in 408 games for the club, and winning three Serie A titles, as well as the Coppa Italia; he later also played for two seasons for local rivals Milan, as well as Turin rivals Juventus for one season, in addition to his spells with Varese and Atalanta. At the international level, he led Italy to win two consecutive World Cups: in 1934 on home soil, and in 1938 as captain, being named to the All-star Team. Widely regarded as one of the best players of the 20th century, and one of the greatest Italian strikers in the history of the sport.

Along with Giovanni Ferrari, Guido Masetti and Eraldo Monzeglio, he is one of only four Italian players to have won two World Cups. Following his retirement, he served as a coach for the Italy national team, and with several Italian clubs, including his former club sides Inter and Atalanta, as well as Pro Patria, and Turkish club Beşiktaş; he was Italy&#x27;s head coach at the 1952 Summer Olympics.

Due to his technical skill, prolific goalscoring, and creative ability, he was often given the nickname &quot;Il genio&quot; (The Genius) by the Italian press during his career. He has been ranked the fourth-best player in the history of the World Cup. A prolific forward, Meazza won the Serie A top-scorer award on three occasions in his career; with 216 goals in Serie A, he is the fourth all-time highest goal scorer in Serie A, alongside José Altafini, and with 33 goals, he is also the second highest goalscorer for the Italy national team. With 338 goals, he is the third-highest Italian goalscorer in all competitions. He is also the youngest player ever to score 100 goals in Serie A, a feat which he achieved at the age of 23 years and 32 days. San Siro, the principal stadium in his native city of Milan, which is today shared by two of his former clubs, Inter Milan and crosstown rivals A.C. Milan, was named &quot;Stadio Giuseppe Meazza&quot; in the player&#x27;s honour on 3 March 1980. In 2011, he was posthumously inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame. Throughout his career, including friendlies, Meazza scored 552 goals.

==Early life==
Meazza was born in Porta Vittoria, Milan. Having lost his father in 1917 during the fighting of World War I at the age of seven, Peppe grew up in Milan with his mother, Ersilia who came from Mediglia, helping her sell fruit at the market. He began playing football at six years old, and started out playing barefoot with a ball made of rags on the streets for a team named the &quot;Maestri Campionesi&quot;. At the age of twelve, his mother gave him permission to pursue a footballing career, and he began playing for Gloria F.C.. It was during this time that a fan gave Meazza his first pair of football boots.

At the age of 14, Meazza admired Milan, but was rejected by the team for his small physique. However, he was instead accepted by Milan&#x27;s cross-city rivals Inter Milan.

Meazza&#x27;s nickname, &quot;il Balilla&quot; (&quot;The Little Boy&quot;), was given to him in 1927 by his older teammate Leopoldo Conti, who thought &quot;Peppìn&quot;, in Milanese dialect, who was only 17 when he joined the senior team, was too young to be associated to the senior team. He was surprised after Inter coach Árpád Weisz decided to give Meazza his debut for Inter in his place, commenting: &quot;Now we even let the Balilla kids play!&quot; The Opera Nazionale Balilla, the Fascist youth organisation which collected all children aged eight to 14 years, was established in 1926, hence why Conti felt it to be a suitable nickname for the young rookie. However, Meazza later scored two goals on his official debut, leaving Conti speechless.

==Club career==
=== Inter ===
Meazza scored two goals on his professional debut, which came in a 6–2 win against Milanese Unione Sportiva in the Coppa Volta di Como, on 12 September 1927. The following day, the Italian sports newspaper &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; praised his game as &quot;intelligent, fresh, quick&quot;. Meazza still holds the record for the most goals scored in a debut season in Serie A, with 31 goals in his first season (1929–30). The next season, he scored five goals in a single game, twice in one season: 6 January 1929 Inter against Pistoiese 9–1 and 17 March 1929 Inter v Verona 9–0. That same season (1928–29) on 12 May 1929, he scored six goals as Inter beat Venezia 10–2. 27 April 1930 was the first time Inter ever played Roma in Milan. Inter won 6–0 and Meazza scored four goals, scoring his first three within three minutes of the game.

With Meazza in the squad, Inter won three national championships in 1930, 1938 and 1940, and helped win the team&#x27;s first Coppa Italia in 1939. In the 1930 deciding game, he scored a second half hat-trick to tie the game against Genoa after Inter had been down 3–0. He was top-scorer of Serie A three times (1930, 1936, 1938), top-scorer in the pre-Serie A year of 1929 and top scorer of the Mitropa Cup three times: 1930 (seven goals), 1933 (five goals) and 1936 (ten goals); he finished with a runners-up medal in the competition in 1933.

When Ambrosiana beat Bari in the 1937–38 championship, he scored five goals in a 9–2 victory. The next week he scored a hat-trick against Lucchese. Along with fellow Inter players Ferraris II, Ferrari and Locatelli, Meazza was involved in the Azzurri set-up that won the 1938 World Cup in Paris. That same year, Inter won their fourth Scudetto, while the club&#x27;s first Coppa Italia success came in 1939.

=== AC Milan and later career ===
An injury put him out of action for most of 1938–39 and 1939–40, and after having devoted the best part of his career to Inter, Meazza transferred to AC Milan on 28 November 1940. Later in his career he also played for Juventus, Varese and Atalanta. His debut for Juventus, on 18 October 1942, took place in the derby against Torino. This was the last season in which he managed to record double figures in terms of goals scored, helping Juventus to a third–place finish in the league. Following this season the Serie A and Coppa Italia were suspended due to the Second World War.

=== Return to Inter ===
In 1946 he was recalled to Inter as a player-coach. He played 17 games, scoring the last two goals of his career to help an Inter team that was in danger of relegation.

==International career==
Meazza played for Italy national team in the 1934 and 1938 World Cups, both of which Italy won. Apart from captaining the World Cup winning team in 1938, Meazza, along with Giovanni Ferrari and Eraldo Monzeglio, also set a record for being one of the only three Italian players to win two World Cups.

=== Early career ===
His debut with the Italy national team was in Rome on 9 February 1930 against Switzerland. Then 19-year-old, Meazza scored twice in that game (in the 37th and 39th minutes) to help Italy to a 4–2 victory after they had been down by two goals in only 19 minutes. The next game Italy played was on 2 March 1930 against Germany in Frankfurt, where Meazza scored a goal in a 2–0 win. A few months later, on 11 May 1930, he scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 game as Italy beat Hungary of Larcos, Hirzer and Pál Titkos for the first time ever while playing in Budapest. Meazza helped Italy win the Central European International Cup that year; the cup was a three-year international tournament between the strongest national teams of central and eastern Europe.

On 25 January 1931, Meazza scored another three goals in a 5–0 friendly win against France. He also scored two goals in the 1931–32 Central European International Cup campaign, in which Italy finished in second place.

His first fifteen caps were at centre-forward, but in 1933, he showed his versatility during a 3–1 victory over Germany in Bologna, when he was moved to an inside-right position by the Italian coach Vittorio Pozzo, to accommodate teammate Angelo Schiavio, a switch that would help Italy win the World Cup the next year as the goals flowed in. During the tournament, Meazza once again demonstrated his adaptability when he was switched to an inside-left.

=== 1934 FIFA World Cup ===
In the 1934 World Cup, which was hosted by Italy, Meazza appeared in every game for the Italians. On 25 March 1934 in Milan, Italy beat Greece 4–0 in a qualifying match with two goals coming from Meazza. He then scored the final goal in their 7–1 victory over the United States in the 89th minute of their World Cup opener. In the game against Spain, Giovanni Ferrari scored a goal against Ricardo Zamora. The game ended 1–1 and had to be settled the next day. Meazza scored from a corner sent in by Raimundo Orsi in the 11th minute. It was the only goal of the game.

The final against Czechoslovakia in Rome&#x27;s Stadio Nazionale PNF. After 90 minutes, the two teams were at 1–1. Italy, though, was in far more trouble as the game went into extra-time until Meazza became the inspirer again. His injury became a mixed blessing as the Czechs did not bother to mark him and he made them rue that decision. In the 5th minute of extra time, Schiavio hit a snap-shot past goalkeeper Frantisek Planicka for the winner. Meazza was elected into the All-Star Team of the tournament and won the Golden Ball, the award presented to the best player at each FIFA World Cup finals.

=== 1933–35 Central European International Cup ===
In 1935 he claimed the Central European International Cup again. Alongside Eraldo Monzeglio, Raimundo Orsi, Raffaele Costantino, Alfredo Pitto, Umberto Caligaris, Luigi Allemandi, Virginio Rosetta &amp; Gianpiero Combi, Meazza is one of only nine (all Italian) players to win two editions of the Central European International Cup (1927–30 and 1933–35); he also finished as the runner-up once with Italy (1931–32), thereby winning two gold medals and a silver medal before the tournament was discontinued due to the &quot;Anschluss&quot;. He holds the all-time record for appearances and goals, sixteen and eight respectively, at Central European International Cup tournaments for the Italy national side. With 8 goals, he is among the all-time top goal scorers in the competition&#x27;s history.

=== 1938 FIFA World Cup and later career ===

In the 1938 World Cup hosted by France, Meazza captained Italy, again playing in every match. In the semi-final against Brazil, with the score at 1–0 Italy were awarded a penalty after Silvio Piola was fouled by Domingos da Guia. As Meazza stepped up to take the kick, with a chance to double his team&#x27;s lead, his shorts fell down, as the elastic in them had ripped; he held them up with his left hand, but he still managed to score, beating the Brazilian goalkeeper Walter from the spot by placing the ball into the corner. The goal enabled Italy to win the match 2–1 and sent them into their second consecutive World Cup final.

In the final, the Italians faced Hungary. Meazza set up goals for Silvio Piola and Gino Colaussi before halftime. The first assist he gave came after a quick exchange with Colaussi, who put Italy up 1–0. The next assist came after he faked a shot, making his defender jump past him, and dribbled past another defender, before sending in a quick pass on the ground for Piola to score. Ten minutes before halftime, after another quick exchange between Ferrari and Meazza, the latter found the unmarked Colaussi with a pass, and the winger netted his second of the game to make it 3–1 at the break. After the tournament, Piola, who scored five goals in France, paid his colleague the compliment of being responsible for his own good performance: &quot;At the FIFA World Cup, I mainly lived off Meazza and Ferrari&quot;.

He played his last match for the national team nine years after his debut, on 20 July 1939 at the Olympiastadion in Helsinki, when he captained Italy to a 3–2 win over Finland. In total, he played 53 times with Italy between 1930 and 1939, losing only six matches, and scoring 33 goals; he is currently Italy&#x27;s second highest goalscorer, behind Luigi Riva.

==Style of play==

Although he was initially deployed as full-back in his youth, Meazza began his professional career as an all out striker or centre forward, but he later played for more than half of his career as a creative inside left forward, known as the &quot;mezzala&quot; role in Italian football jargon, although he was also capable of playing on the right. He further demonstrated his skill and creative ability by also becoming an accomplished attacking midfielder, and even played as a central midfielder or as a deep-lying playmaker in his later career. He was known for his excellent shooting ability and intoxicating dribbling skills, with an eye for the final pass. Despite his average height and slight yet stocky build, he was also an exceptional header of the ball and was known for his acrobatic abilities in the air. Beyond his qualities as a player, he was also a great leader on the pitch.

Meazza was the first Italian football player who became famous worldwide and was the first player with personal sponsors. Unlike his more reserved friend, international teammate, and club rival Silvio Piola, a player with whom Meazza was often compared, he was known for having a much more flamboyant character both on and off the pitch. He loved his cabriolet, champagne and women and was the only player on the national team that was allowed to smoke. Meazza was famous for humiliating the best defenders of the era and for sleeping at a brothel the night before a match. With his plush touch on the ball, he would cause panic in the robust defenders from an era where two-footed tackles from behind were often waved on. Not known for having a particularly high work rate, sometimes he would not get out of bed until his teammates were already finished training. He also loved the Tango and used this proficiency to make him unpredictable on the field and could score goals at fox-trot tempo.

He was a superb dribbler who despite his speed, never had a single brylcreemed hair out of place, and although he was not tall, was remarkably good in the air. Meazza created many chances for his teammates and scored goals as well. His bending goals &quot;a foglia morta&quot;, the &quot;dead leaf technique&quot;, in particular from free-kicks, were also feared by goalkeepers. As an offensive playmaker, he was a brilliant passer, two-footed, had remarkable field vision, and was noted for his balance and agility on the ball, as well as his control, turns and spins.

His trademark goals were ones where he would collect the ball at the half-line, dribble through several opponents with a series of twinkle-toed shuffles, and turns, until arriving in front of the goal, where he would stop and invite the goalkeeper to attack him like a matador, before faking a shot, then dribbling past the beaten goalkeeper to slot home easily. In away games, the defenders would often foul and hack him to avoid being humiliated. &quot;Gol alla Meazza&quot; and &quot;finte alla Meazza&quot; have since become popular sayings for Italian football fans to describe a truly inspiring goal off the dribble or a series of jukes. His goals &quot;ad invito&quot;, where he would invite the goalkeeper out before dribbling around him is yet another popular saying. An accurate penalty taker, Meazza once said, &quot;There is nothing worse than having a penalty kick saved by a keeper who didn&#x27;t understand the fake.&quot;

===Reception===
Meazza is widely considered one of the best players of his generation, and among the greatest of all time, as well as being regarded by many in the sport as Italy&#x27;s greatest ever player.

Vittorio Pozzo, the mastermind coach behind both Italian World Cup victories, wrote of Meazza: &quot;He was a born forward. He saw the game, understood the situation, distributed the ball carefully and made the team offence operate. Having him on the team was like starting the game 1–0 up.&quot;

Sports journalist Gianni Brera, who considered Meazza to be the greatest footballer in the history of the game, called him &quot;Il Folber&quot;, and dubbed his style of play the &quot;fasso-tuto-mi&quot;, because he considered him to be the complete central midfielder and a nimble acrobat. When describing Meazza, Brera said: &quot;He was only Italian that stood out amongst the sensational Brazilians and Argentines&quot;. Following Meazza&#x27;s death in 1979, Brera also added: &quot;The world was full of great football players, maybe some even tougher and more consistent than him, but to us it seemed that one could not go beyond his sudden inventions, his ingenious runs, his peremptory yet never condescending dribbling, his solo break-away runs towards the usual stray victim, the opposing goalkeeper.&quot;

Peppino Prisco, who became vice-president of Inter Milan in 1963 and won every major trophy possible with the club, also considered Meazza to be the best player of all time, and said of him: &quot;Meazza was great, unbeatable, even if he would occasionally run into a frightful crisis, caused by his intense sexual activity and his passion for the game. When he took over on the field, he did things that left the mouth ajar.&quot;

Bruno Acari IV, who played with Meazza at A.C. Milan and later coached, once said that &quot;Peppino [Meazza] never wanted to hear about tactics. He was a simple person who became a king when he entered the goal box, with a technical ability that was comparable to Pelé.&quot;

==Death==

Meazza died on 21 August 1979 of pancreas failure in Lissone, Italy, two days before his 69th birthday. He is buried at the Monumental Cemetery of Milan.

==Trivia==
*Meazza was one of the first Italians to coach abroad, coaching Beşiktaş J.K. of Turkey in 1948–49.
*While serving as a youth coach for Inter, he met Sandro Mazzola. Understanding the boy&#x27;s pain at losing a father while so young and recognising his skills, Meazza took young Sandro under his wing, and convinced him to sign for Inter. This is however controversial, as the honour of having brought Sandro and his brother Ferruccio Mazzola to Inter is also attributed to an Inter player of the time, Benito &quot;Veleno&quot; Lorenzi, who was a friend and fellow Italian international to the boys&#x27; father, Torino legend Valentino Mazzola.
*Meazza is a FIFA Hall of Champions Inductee and Italian Football Hall of Fame Entrant. He was selected by IFFHS/FIFA as the 2nd Best Italian player as one of the best 25 World Players of the 20th Century, and was also selected to Italy&#x27;s Sports Walk of Fame in 2015.
*Meazza is still today the joint-fourth top-scorer ever in Serie A along with José Altafini.
*Many Italian football experts, including Alberto Giocattoli, consider him to be the best player ever, and even Silvio Piola was quoted saying: &quot;He is, without a doubt, one of the greatest Italian footballers ever. He is a symbol to our great country and we should cherish him.&quot;
*With 33 goals, Meazza remains of the Italy national team its second highest scorer. His record stood until Gigi Riva tied and eventually broke it on 9 June 1973, also in a game against Brazil. On that day, Meazza was quoted as saying, &quot;That Riva is good, he scored a lot of goals against Cyprus and Turkey. Surely my goals were much more important.&quot;
*The San Siro stadium of Milan, which hosts two of Meazza&#x27;s former clubs, Inter Milan and A.C. Milan, was renamed the &quot;Stadio Giuseppe Meazza&quot; in his honour.

<doc id="611983" wikidata="Q4839752" url="?curid=611983" title="Backstage Lensman">
<text>&quot;Backstage Lensman&quot; is a short story by Randall Garrett, a parody or pastiche of the Lensman series of E.E. &#x27;Doc&#x27; Smith. It was first written in 1949, lost and then rewritten in 1978.

Garrett claimed that &quot;Doc read the first version of &#x27;Backstage Lensman&#x27; and laughed all through the convention. It was his suggestion that I call the spaceship &quot;Dentless&quot; rather than &quot;Dauntless&quot;.&quot;
==Publication history==
This story appeared in:
* The magazine &quot;Analog&quot;, June 1978
* &quot;Takeoff&quot;, a collection of short fiction and poems by Randall Garrett, 1980
* &quot;Shaggy B.E.M. Stories&quot;, an anthology edited by Mike Resnick, 1988

<text>In cryptography, LOKI97 is a block cipher which was a candidate in the Advanced Encryption Standard competition. It is a member of the LOKI family of ciphers, with earlier instances being LOKI89 and LOKI91. LOKI97 was designed by Lawrie Brown, assisted by Jennifer Seberry and Josef Pieprzyk.

Like DES, LOKI97 is a 16-round Feistel cipher, and like other AES candidates, has a 128-bit block size and a choice of a 128-, 192- or 256-bit key length. It uses 16 rounds of a balanced Feistel network to process the input data blocks (see diagram right). The complex round function f incorporates two substitution-permutation layers in each round. The key schedule is also a Feistel structure – an unbalanced one unlike the main network — but using the same F-function.
The LOKI97 round function (shown right) uses two columns each with multiple copies of two basic S-boxes. These S-boxes are designed to be highly non-linear and have a good XOR profile. The permutations before and between serve to provide auto-keying and to diffuse the S-box outputs as quickly as possible.

The authors have stated that, &quot;LOKI97 is a non-proprietary algorithm, available for royalty-free use worldwide as a possible replacement for the DES or other existing block ciphers.&quot; It was intended to be an evolution of the earlier LOKI89 and LOKI91 block ciphers.

It was the first published candidate in the Advanced Encryption Standard competition, and was quickly analysed and attacked. An analysis of some problems with the LOKI97 design, which led to its rejection when shortlisting candidates, is given in a paper (Rijmen &amp; Knudsen 1999). It was found to be susceptible to an effective theoretical differential cryptanalysis attack considerably faster than an exhaustive search.

<text>The St. Louis Symphony Orchestra (SLSO) is an American symphony orchestra based in St. Louis, Missouri. Founded in 1880 by Joseph Otten as the St. Louis Choral Society, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra is the second-oldest professional symphony orchestra in the United States, preceded only by the New York Philharmonic. Its principal concert venue is Powell Hall, located in midtown St. Louis.

==History==
The St. Louis Choral Society performed in the auditorium of the St. Louis Mercantile Library at Locust and Broadway in Downtown St. Louis. During the 1881/82 season the 80-member chorus was joined by an orchestra of 31 members. A disbanded Musical Union joined the group. In 1893, the St. Louis Choral-Symphony was formally incorporated. It remained largely a choral organization through its performances at the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair under Alfred Ernst when it expanded to a 200-member chorus and an orchestra of 55. Under Max Zach&#x27;s tenure (1907 to 1921), it changed its name to the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra.

Before moving to its current home in Powell Hall, the SLSO performed for many years at the Kiel Opera House. The orchestra has given concerts regularly at Carnegie Hall and has made overseas tours to Europe and to Japan. The St. Louis Symphony has recorded for the Columbia, RCA Victor, Red Seal, Telarc, Vox/Turnabout, Angel EMI, and Nonesuch labels. It has also issued CD recordings on its own label, Arch Media, and has received seven Grammy Awards and 58 nominations. For Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, the St. Louis Symphony has been the resident orchestra since 1978, divided into two ensembles, each performing two of the operas in the season. Also associated with the orchestra is the St. Louis Symphony Chorus, which was founded in 1977. Its first director was Thomas Peck. 

The national prestige of the St. Louis Symphony grew most prominently during the music directorship of Leonard Slatkin, from 1979 to 1996. During his tenure, the orchestra made many recordings for the EMI and RCA Victor labels, and toured to Europe and the Far East, as well as concerts at Carnegie Hall. However, this growth in prestige was not matched by stabilization of long-term finances. In 2000, the SLSO&#x27;s endowment stood at US$28 million. In 2000, the executive director and President of the SLSO at the time, Don Roth, had secured a US$40 million challenge grant from the Taylor family (owners of privately held Enterprise Rent-A-Car) to help the organization&#x27;s money situation. However, in that same year, he revealed the situation of severe financial problems with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra finances, which nearly led to the orchestra&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2001. Roth resigned his position in July 2001, and was succeeded by Randy Adams, a former St. Louis bank executive. Adams embarked on extensive fund-raising efforts in the following years, seeking to enlarge the SLSO&#x27;s endowment in the process. As part of the budget cuts and cost-saving measures, the musicians agreed to salary cuts over that time, and also a reduction of their 52-week contract to 42 weeks.

Following the departure of Hans Vonk as music director after the 2001-2002 season, Itzhak Perlman served as music adviser to the orchestra from 2002 to 2004. In December 2003, the symphony&#x27;s board announced David Robertson as the next music director of the orchestra, effective with the 2005/06 season.

In January 2005, a labor dispute led to a cancellation of concerts for two months. Before the musicians could vote on the terms of the new contract, management changed the locks to Powell Hall without notifying them. Auditions were cancelled, and the health insurance for musicians was cancelled without notice as well. Whilst the musicians considered themselves to be &#x27;locked out&#x27;, management considered this action to be an illegal strike, since the players&#x27; attorney, Leonard Leibowitz, had advised them against filing certain documents as required by law. The National Labor Relations Board agreed with management. After a two-month period of negotiations, the musicians agreed to a ten-week reduction from a 52-week season, and 30% wage reductions. Upon returning to the stage, the musicians enacted a &quot;Vote of No Confidence&quot; on Executive Director Randy Adams. Both parties then reached a mutual agreement under which they agreed to refer to the eight-week period as a &quot;Work Stoppage&quot; and the &quot;Vote of No Confidence&quot; was rescinded. In March 2005, the musicians and Adams agreed to a new contract.

From 2005–2018, the SLSO music director was David Robertson. During Robertson&#x27;s tenure, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra has partnered with St. Louis Public Radio to broadcast its subscription concerts live every Saturday night during its regular season, since the fall of 2010, after the sale of the St. Louis classical radio station KFUO. Robertson conducted the orchestra&#x27;s first-ever appearance at The Proms in September 2012. In 2013, Robertson&#x27;s contract was extended through the 2015/16 season, and a further contract extension, announced in March 2014, was through the 2017/18 season. Robertson&#x27;s tenure as SLSO music director concluded at the end of the 2017/2018 season.

Adams stood-down as the orchestra&#x27;s president and executive director in June 2007. Fred Bronstein assumed the posts in March 2008. Faced with declining ticket sales and deficits, Bronstein immediately launched an aggressive new revenue plan with audience development at the core of its actions. Bronstein also took steps to broaden and diversify the symphony&#x27;s programming through popularly oriented programming series such as &quot;Live at Powell Hall&quot;. Since 2008, because of new programming and marketing strategies, ticket revenues have grown 39% in the 2012 fiscal year, the highest revenues in over a decade, while seats sold grew by 16% and more than 31,000 new people were added to the customer base, reversing five years of decline. Because of successful audience development initiatives at the core of the plan as well as other revenue progress and strong management of expenses, the structural deficit (whose gaps are funded by additional contributions) has declined 18% from $3.4M in 2007 to $2.8M in 2011, dipping as low as $2.62m in 2010.

Bronstein left the SLSO to head the Peabody Conservatory in the spring of 2014. In February 2015, the SLSO named Marie-Hélène Bernard, then-president of the Handel and Haydn Society as its new president and CEO, effective July 1, 2015.

In 2003, Stéphane Denève first guest-conducted the orchestra. In June 2017, the orchestra named Denève as its next music director, effective with the 2019-2020 season, with an initial contract of three seasons. He held the title of Music Director Designate for the 2018-2019 season. In March 2021, the orchestra announced the extension of Denève&#x27;s contract as its music director through the 2025-2026 season.

In March 2022, the orchestra announced plans for a renovation of Powell Hall, to begin in 2023. During the scheduled renovation period, the orchestra is to give concerts principally at the Touhill Performing Arts Center of the University of Missouri–St. Louis and at the Stifel Theatre.

== Awards ==
In its 140-year history, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra has earned nine Grammy Awards out of 60 nominations from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
==St. Louis Symphony Youth Orchestra==
Leonard Slatkin established the St. Louis Symphony Youth Orchestra in 1970. The orchestra&#x27;s assistant conductor (known also in the past as resident conductor) also acts as music director of the St. Louis Symphony Youth Orchestra. Past St. Louis Symphony Orchestra Assistant Conductors have included Slatkin, Gerhardt Zimmermann, David Loebel, David Amado, Scott Parkman, Ward Stare, Steven Jarvi, and Gemma New. In December 2020, the SLSO announced the appointment of Stephanie Childress as its next assistant conductor and music director of the St. Louis Symphony Youth Orchestra, effective with the 2021-2022 season. Childress concluded her tenure with the orchestra at the close of the 2022-2023 season. In July 2024, the SLSO announced the appointment of Samuel Hollister as its next assistant conductor and music director of the St. Louis Symphony Youth Orchestra, effective with the 2024-2025 season.

==Chorus ensembles==
The St. Louis Symphony Orchestra houses two choral ensembles: the St. Louis Symphony Chorus and the IN UNISON Chorus. Founded in 1977 by music director Jerzy Semkow and its first director, Thomas Peck, the St. Louis Symphony Chorus is an orchestral chorus that performs in major concerts throughout each season, usually featured in choral symphonies. Peck served as director of the St. Louis Symphony Chorus until his death in 1994. Amy Kaiser succeeded Peck as director of the St. Louis Symphony Chorus, from 1995 to 2022. In February 2024, Erin Freeman made her first appearance as guest chorus director with the SLSO and the St. Louis Symphony Chorus. In July 2024, the SLSO announced the appointment of Freeman as the next director of the St. Louis Symphony Chorus, with immediate effect.

The IN UNISON Chorus was established in 1994 by Robert Ray, and performs a variety of musical styles; it primarily focuses on the music of African-American and African cultures, notably gospel music, and partners with several churches in the St. Louis area. The IN UNISON Chorus is currently directed by Kevin McBeth, who is also Director of Music at Manchester United Methodist Church in suburban St. Louis. The ensemble celebrated its 25th anniversary during the 2018/2019 season. 

The St. Louis Symphony Orchestra also features the Holiday Festival Chorus, consisting of high-school-aged singers from across the St. Louis region, performing at holiday concerts each season.

<text>An Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR, ) was a type of administrative unit in the Soviet Union (USSR), created for certain ethnic groups to be the titular nations of. The ASSRs had a status lower than the constituent union republics of the USSR, but higher than the autonomous oblasts and the autonomous okrugs.

In the Russian SFSR, for example, Chairmen of the Government of the ASSRs were officially members of the Government of the RSFSR. Unlike the union republics, the autonomous republics only had the right to disaffiliate themselves from the Union when the union republic containing them did so, as well as to choose to stay with the Union separately from them. The level of political, administrative and cultural autonomy they enjoyed varied with time—it was most substantial in the 1920s (Korenizatsiya), the 1950s after the death of Joseph Stalin, and in the Brezhnev Era.

According to the constitution of the USSR, in case of a union republic voting on leaving the Soviet Union, autonomous republics, autonomous oblasts and autonomous okrugs had the right, by means of a referendum, to independently resolve whether they will stay in the USSR or leave with the seceding union republic, as well as to raise the issue of their state-legal status.

==Azerbaijan SSR==
==Georgian SSR==
==Russian SFSR==
The 1978 Constitution of the RSFSR recognized sixteen autonomous republics within the RSFSR:
Gorno-Altai Autonomous Oblast (now Altai Republic), Adyghe Autonomous Oblast (now Republic of Adygea), Karachay–Cherkess Autonomous Oblast (now Karachay–Cherkess Republic) and Khakassian Autonomous Oblast (now Republic of Khakassia) were all promoted in status to that of an ASSR in 1991, in the last year of the Soviet Union. Only the Jewish Autonomous Oblast retained its autonomous oblast status in Russia.

Other autonomous republics also existed within RSFSR at earlier points of the Soviet history:
Crimea Oblast was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR jurisdiction on 19 February 1954 and promoted to the ASSR status following a referendum held on January 20, 1991 (now the Autonomous Republic of Crimea / Republic of Crimea, territory disputed between Ukraine and the Russian Federation).

==Uzbek SSR==
==ASSRs promoted to union republics==
Some ASSRs existed at earlier points of the Soviet history were promoted into full union republics of the Soviet Union.
Karelian ASSR was promoted to Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic in 1940 but demoted back in 1956.

<text>An autonomous republic is a type of administrative division similar to a province or state. A significant number of autonomous republics can be found within the successor states of the Soviet Union, but the majority are located within Russia. Many of these republics were established during the Soviet period as Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics, or ASSRs.

==Autonomous republics within the former republics of the Soviet Union==

*Ukraine: Crimea (disputed with and occupied by Russia)
*Uzbekistan: Karakalpakstan

==Eastern Europe==
* Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus
* Comrat Republic (1906, self-proclaimed)

<doc id="612000" wikidata="Q1365087" url="?curid=612000" title="Hadamard's inequality">
<text>In mathematics, Hadamard&#x27;s inequality (also known as Hadamard&#x27;s theorem on determinants) is a result first published by Jacques Hadamard in 1893. It is a bound on the determinant of a matrix whose entries are complex numbers in terms of the lengths of its column vectors. In geometrical terms, when restricted to real numbers, it bounds the volume in Euclidean space of &quot;n&quot; dimensions marked out by &quot;n&quot; vectors &quot;vi&quot; for 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot; in terms of the lengths of these vectors ||&quot;vi&quot;&amp;hairsp;||.

Specifically, Hadamard&#x27;s inequality states that if &quot;N&quot; is the matrix having columns &quot;vi&quot;, then
:formula_1
If the &quot;n&quot; vectors are non-zero, equality in Hadamard&#x27;s inequality is achieved if and only if the vectors are orthogonal.

==Alternate forms and corollaries==
A corollary is that if the entries of an &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;N&quot; are bounded by &quot;B&quot;, so |&quot;Nij&quot;&amp;hairsp;| ≤ &quot;B&quot; for all &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;, then
:formula_2
In particular, if the entries of &quot;N&quot; are +1 and −1 only then
:formula_3
In combinatorics, matrices &quot;N&quot; for which equality holds, i.e. those with orthogonal columns, are called Hadamard matrices.

More generally, suppose that &quot;N&quot; is a complex matrix of order &quot;n&quot;, whose entries are bounded by |&quot;Nij&quot;&amp;hairsp;| ≤ 1, for each &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; between 1 and &quot;n&quot;. Then Hadamard&#x27;s inequality states that

: formula_4

Equality in this bound is attained for a real matrix &quot;N&quot; if and only if &quot;N&quot; is a Hadamard matrix.

A positive-semidefinite matrix &quot;P&quot; can be written as &quot;N&quot;*&quot;N&quot;, where &quot;N&quot;* denotes the conjugate transpose of &quot;N&quot; (see Decomposition of a semidefinite matrix). Then
:formula_5
So, the determinant of a positive definite matrix is less than or equal to the product of its diagonal entries. Sometimes this is also known as Hadamard&#x27;s inequality.

==Proof==
The result is trivial if the matrix &quot;N&quot; is singular, so assume the columns of &quot;N&quot; are linearly independent. By dividing each column by its length, it can be seen that the result is equivalent to the special case where each column has length 1, in other words if &quot;ei&quot; are unit vectors and &quot;M&quot; is the matrix having the &quot;ei&quot; as columns then
and equality is achieved if and only if the vectors are an orthogonal set. The general result now follows:
:formula_6

To prove (1), consider &quot;P&quot; =&quot;M*M&quot; where &quot;M*&quot; is the conjugate transpose of &quot;M&quot;, and let the eigenvalues of &quot;P&quot; be λ1, λ2, … λ&quot;n&quot;. Since the length of each column of &quot;M&quot; is 1, each entry in the diagonal of &quot;P&quot; is 1, so the trace of &quot;P&quot; is &quot;n&quot;. Applying the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means,
:formula_7
so
:formula_8

If there is equality then each of the &quot;λ&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27;s must all be equal and their sum is &quot;n&quot;, so they must all be 1. The matrix &quot;P&quot; is Hermitian, therefore diagonalizable, so it is the identity matrix—in other words the columns of &quot;M&quot; are an orthonormal set and the columns of &quot;N&quot; are an orthogonal set. Many other proofs can be found in the literature.

<text>The first USS &quot;Cummings&quot; (DD-44) was a used by the United States Navy during World War I. She was later transferred to the United States Coast Guard, where she was designated CG-3. She was named for Lieutenant Commander Andrew Boyd Cummings.

&quot;Cummings&quot; was launched on 6 August 1913 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; sponsored by Mrs. H. Beates, Jr., niece of Lieutenant Commander Cummings; and commissioned on 19 September 1913.

==Pre-World War I==
Departing Boston in November 1913, &quot;Cummings&quot; cruised along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean until the following June, when she joined the Neutrality Patrol and cruised off the coast until the United States entered into World War I.

==World War I==
Arriving at New York Navy Yard on 12 May 1917 to be outfitted for foreign service, &quot;Cummings&quot; sailed on 15 May, reaching the Destroyer Base, Queenstown, Ireland on 26 May. She was commanded by the future admiral, Henry Kent Hewitt. She served in the cross-channel escort service under Commander, US Naval Forces Operating in European Waters, and also conducted anti-submarine patrols off the southern Irish coast, making contact in 14 encounters. The ship continued to serve on escort assignments off the coast of France after the war. She was one of the escort ships for , carrying President Woodrow Wilson to Brest, France.

==Inter-war period==
&quot;Cummings&quot; departed French waters on 16 December 1918, and from 6–9 April 1919 she joined in destroyer maneuvers and gunnery exercises at Guantanamo Bay. In July and August, she operated off Newport, and then was in reserve at Philadelphia from August 1919-March 1921. She returned to operations off the east coast with the Fleet until placed out of commission in Philadelphia on 23 June 1922.

Transferred to the Treasury Department for the Coast Guard on 6 June 1924, &quot;Cummings&quot; served as part of the Rum Patrol. She was based in New London, Connecticut until transferred to Stapleton, New York in 1931.

&quot;Cummings&quot; was returned to the Navy on 23 May 1932 and sold on 22 August 1934 for scrapping in accordance with the London Naval Treaty.

<text>The Beretta Cheetah, also known as the 80 Series and originally known as the Series 81, is a line of compact blowback operated semi-automatic pistols designed and manufactured by Beretta of Italy. They were introduced in 1976 and include models in .32 ACP (Models 81 and 82), .380 ACP (9 mm Short) (Models 83, 84, 85, 86, and 80X) and .22 LR (Models 87, 87 Target and 89). Production paused in 2017, but Beretta revived the marque in 2023 with the release of the 80X (an updated version of the 84).

==Models==
===81 and 82===
These two models are chambered for the .32 ACP cartridge. The 81 has a double stacked magazine with 12 round capacity, while the 82 has a single stacked magazine with nine round capacity and resultant thinner grips.

===83, 84 and 85 ===
These three models are chambered for the .380 ACP (&quot;9 mm Short&quot;) cartridge. The 84 has a double stacked magazine with 13 round capacity, while the 83 and 85 have a single stacked magazine with seven and eight round capacity respectively, and resultant thinner grips. The 84 and 85 have a 3.81&quot; barrel, while the 83 has a 4&quot; barrel.

===86===
Introduced in 1991, the model 86 is chambered for the .380 ACP (&quot;9 mm Short&quot;) cartridge, but differs significantly from other models in the series, because it has a redesigned front end with a tip-up barrel that hinges at the muzzle to open the breech. This allows the shooter to load a cartridge directly into the chamber, and not have to operate the slide. The 86 uses a single-stack magazine like the 85. Due to low demand, the 86 was discontinued in 2004. Because of its rarity, the 86 demands high prices on the collector&#x27;s market. In 2023, EAA released a clone of the 86 called the Girsan MC-14T. The MC-14T is very similar to the 86, except it uses a standard 84 double stack magazine instead of the 86&#x27;s single stack, and has an accessory rail.

===87===
Introduced in 1977, there are two distinct 87 models both chambered for .22 LR. The standard model is similar to other models, but the 87 Target has a longer barrel and slide, can accept optical sights, and is single action only. The 87 was discontinued in 2013, although it was produced again briefly in 2017. The 87 is considered one of the rarest models.

===89===
Produced from 1984 to 2012, the model 89 is also chambered for the .22 LR and is designed for competition and range training, with a lightweight frame and ergonomic grips.

===80X===

Introduced in 2023, the 80X is an updated version of the model 84FS chambered for the .380 ACP (&quot;9 mm Short&quot;) cartridge. It has a Vertec (straight back) grip, reshaped trigger guard, newly designed grip panels, a skeletonized hammer, a Picatinny rail on the frame for accessories like a light or laser, and an optics ready slide. It also has an improved adjustable X-Treme S trigger, removable dovetailed front and rear sights, an easier-to-rack slide with front and rear serrations, and lightened recoil from tuning of the slide weight and spring rates. This gun uses a captive recoil guide rod assembly instead of having separate guide rod and recoil spring parts like prior models. Beretta ships the 80X with magazines that do not have a metal strip across the follower lip that engages the slide catch (similar to MecGar&#x27;s magazines for the 84). This design helps hollow point bullets feed reliably. 13-round Beretta 84 magazines can be used with the 80X, but FMJ bullets should be used in such instances. New production 80X magazines will work in older 84 guns, but they will not engage the magazine disconnect safety if the gun has one. In addition, Beretta offers the 80X line in different frame finishes, including green, gray and bronze. In 2024, the Beretta 80X Urban Tactical was introduced, which features a threaded barrel and two 15-round extended magazines. In 2025, Beretta introduced the 80x in .32 ACP (&quot;7.65mm Browning&quot;), which will accept 12-round Beretta 81 magazines. Beretta will also be offering conversion kits that can turn a .380 80X into a .32 just with a barrel and magazine swap.

==Versions==
There are potentially five versions for models 81 through 87. The features for each version in models 81, 82, 84 and 85 are consistent between models (i.e., the 81FS, 82FS, 84FS and 85FS all have similar features). This is not the case with models 83, 86, 87 and 89, which were not made in all versions.

===Base versions (no letter suffix)===
Base versions of models 81 through 87 are noted for having a rounded trigger guard and generally fewer safety features than subsequent versions. The safety lever is ambidextrous and frame mounted. The frame is alloy, the slide is blued steel and the standard grips are wood. Also, the guide rods and recoil springs are thinner than subsequent versions. The backs of the guide rods are flat, whereas the backs of the guide rods for later versions have a small &quot;nub&quot; or bump.

===B versions===
Introduced in 1980, the B versions of models 81, 82, 84, and 85 introduced an automatic firing pin safety, a shorter extractor and grooved front and back straps. The &quot;B&quot; designation means &quot;Brevettato&quot;, meaning &quot;patent&quot;, referring to a new alteration on the design.

===BB versions===
Introduced in 1982, the BB versions of models 81, 82, 84 and 85 have more serrations on the slide as well as white dot and post sights. The guide rod and recoil spring are slightly wider than in previous iterations, and the guide rod has a small &quot;nub&quot; or bump on the back. The &quot;BB&quot; designation means &quot;Brevettato Brevettato&quot;, meaning that it is the second alteration to the design. Beretta also produced nickel-plated versions of some of the BB generation.

===F versions===
Introduced around 1988, the F versions of models 81, 82, 84 and 85 introduced the &quot;combat&quot; trigger guard with a squared-off front that allows for a finger hold, plastic grips, a proprietary &quot;Bruniton&quot; finish, a chrome-plated barrel and chamber, and a combination safety and decocker lever. Because the F version incorporates Bruniton, a chromed barrel and a squared trigger guard, much like the Beretta 92F, which had been released around the same time, Beretta added the similar F designation to the 84. The &quot;F&quot; means &quot;Federale&quot;, or &quot;Federal&quot; in Italian, which was added to the 92 to denote its entry into United States federal government testing.

===FS versions===
Introduced around 1990, Beretta improved the decocker mechanism in models 81, 82, 84 and 85 to avoid the levers getting stuck in a &quot;half&quot; position. (The &quot;F&quot; versions could still be fired if the decocker levers were in the &quot;half&quot; position, and the frame area near the levers could be chipped.) The 81FS, 84FS, and 85FS were occasionally available in nickel finishes. The &quot;FS&quot; designation signifies either &quot;Scivolo&quot; (meaning &quot;slide&quot;) or &quot;Sicurezza&quot; (meaning &quot;patent&quot; or safe&quot;) in Italian, due to the design&#x27;s improved safety mechanism.

===X versions (currently only the 80X)===
The 80X uses a captive recoil guide rod assembly, a larger beavertail on the back of the frame (to protect against &quot;slide bite&quot;), and a Vertec (straight back) grip.

Beretta has sold factory-painted Bronze and Olive Drab Green models of the 80X in addition to the standard blued model. The &quot;X&quot; suffix is added to the model number to signify its use of the Xtreme-S trigger system, much like the 92X. Beretta has also released a Tactical Urban model with a threaded barrel for suppressor use and an extended 15 round magazine.

==Browning BDA 380 &amp; FN 140 DA==

From 1977 to 1997, Beretta built the Browning BDA 380, which is essentially the model 84BB with a standard ejection port (instead of an open slide), a slide-mounted decocker/safety, and a spur hammer. Beretta also made the FN 140 DA, which is identical to the BDA 380 except for being marked &quot;Fabrique Nationale&quot; instead of &quot;Browning&quot;. The 140 DA was also made in a .32 ACP version.

==Clones==
Two Turkish companies, Girsan and Tisas, manufacture pistols based on the BB versions of .380 Cheetahs.

<doc id="612007" wikidata="Q2527167" url="?curid=612007" title="Lessons of Darkness">
<text>Lessons of Darkness () is a 1992 documentary film directed by Werner Herzog. The film is an exploration of the ravaged oil fields of post-Gulf War Kuwait, portrayed in a manner that accentuates the catastrophic and surreal nature of the landscape. An effective companion to Herzog&#x27;s earlier film &quot;Fata Morgana&quot;, the film again perceives the desert as a landscape with its voice.

A co-production with Paul Berriff, the film was financed by the television studios Canal+ and Première.

==Synopsis==
The film is a meditation on catastrophe, contextualized through the literary modes of religion and science fiction. It begins with a quotation, attributed to Blaise Pascal: &quot;The collapse of the stellar universe will occur – like creation – in grandiose splendor.&quot; This attribution is apocryphal, as the text was written by Herzog for the film and chosen, like the music, to give the film a certain mood. The prologue of the quotation is followed by thirteen sections, denoted by numbered title cards: &quot;A Capital City&quot;, &quot;The War&quot;, &quot;After the Battle&quot;, &quot;Finds from Torture Chambers&quot;, &quot;Satan&#x27;s National Park&quot;, &quot;Childhood&quot;, &quot;And a Smoke Arose like a Smoke from a Furnace&quot;, &quot;A Pilgrimage&quot;, &quot;Dinosaurs on the Go&quot;, &quot;Protuberances&quot;, &quot;The Drying Up of the Source&quot;, &quot;Life Without the Fire&quot; and &quot;I am so tired of sighing; Lord, let it be night&quot;.

Mostly devoid of commentary, the imagery concentrates on the aftermath of the first Gulf War – specifically on the Kuwaiti oil fires, although no relevant political or geographical information is mentioned. Herzog intended to alienate the audience from images to which they had become inured from saturated news coverage. In his words, Herzog wanted to &quot;penetrate deeper than CNN ever could&quot;. Herzog uses a telephoto lens, truck-mounted shots as in &quot;Fata Morgana&quot;, static shots of the workers near the oil fires, and many helicopter shots of the bleak landscape. By avoiding establishing shots, Herzog heightens the apocalyptic effect of depicting the devastated landscape. Herzog remarked that &quot;the film has not a single frame that can be recognised as our planet, and yet we know it must have been shot here&quot;.

Herzog&#x27;s sparse commentary interprets the imagery out of its documentary context, and into a fiction: the opening narration begins &quot;A planet in our solar system/wide mountain ranges, clouds, the land shrouded in mist&quot;. The narrative stance is detached, bemused; Herzog makes no effort to explain the actual causes of the catastrophic scenes, but interprets them in epic terms with vaunting rhetoric to accompany the Wagnerian score. The workers are described as &quot;creatures&quot; whose behaviour is motivated by madness and a desire to perpetuate the damage that they are witnessing. A climactic scene involves the workers re-igniting the flow of oil, shortly after succeeding in stopping the fires. The narration asks, &quot;Has life without fire become unbearable for them?&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Lessons of Darkness&quot; won &quot;Grand Prix&quot; at the Melbourne International Film Festival. At the close of its screening at the Berlin Film Festival, the audience reacted furiously to the film, rising to castigate Herzog with accusations that he had aestheticised the horror of the war. The director waved his hands fiercely and protested &quot;You&#x27;re all wrong! You&#x27;re all wrong!&quot;, and later maintained Hieronymous Bosch and Goya had done likewise in their art.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ end of year review for 1992 recognized the film as &quot;the year&#x27;s most memorable documentary&quot;, describing it as &quot;Herzog&#x27;s apocalyptic, ultimately ironic view of the Gulf War&quot;. Critic Janet Maslin remarked that the director &quot;uses his gift for eloquent abstraction to create sobering, obscenely beautiful images of a natural world that has run amok&quot;; her colleague J. Hoberman called it &quot;the culmination of Mr. Herzog&#x27;s romantic doomsday worldview&quot;. Academic Rachel June Torbett hailed &quot;Lessons of Darkness&quot; as both &quot;extraordinarily beautiful&quot; and &quot;deeply ambiguous&quot;, interpreting the decontextualization of the geopolitical background as an avoidance which meant that the intent of the work lacked clarity.

The technique of re-contextualizing documentary footage was also used in Herzog&#x27;s later film &quot;The Wild Blue Yonder&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The sources of music used in the film were classical, and predominantly theatrical:

<text>Andrew Boyd Cummings (22 June 1830 – 18 March 1863) was an officer in the United States Navy during the American Civil War who was killed in action off the coast of Louisiana. Two naval ships, USS &quot;Cummings&quot;, have been named in his honor.

==Biography==
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Cummings was appointed midshipman in 1846 after graduation from Central High School of Philadelphia, but was detached from the Naval Academy the next year for active duty in &quot;Brandywine&quot;, returning to school in 1852.

During the Civil War, he served with distinction in Admiral David Farragut&#x27;s West Gulf Blockading Squadron as the Executive Officer of &quot;Richmond&quot;, participating in the action at Forts Jackson and Saint Philip, Louisiana. He showed conspicuous gallantry as the squadron passed the batteries of Port Hudson, Louisiana, 14–15 March 1863, and died of wounds received in that action, at New Orleans, 18 March 1863. He was interred in his family&#x27;s plot in Laurel Hill Cemetery, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="612011" wikidata="Q2034475" url="?curid=612011" title="Ernesto Miranda">
<text>Ernesto Arturo Miranda (March 9, 1941 – January 31, 1976) was an American laborer whose criminal conviction was set aside in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;, which ruled that criminal suspects must be informed of their right against self-incrimination and their right to consult with an attorney before being questioned by police. This warning is known as a &quot;Miranda&quot; warning. Miranda had been convicted of kidnapping, rape, and armed robbery charges based on his confession under police interrogation.

After the Supreme Court decision invalidated Miranda&#x27;s initial conviction, the state of Arizona tried him again. At the second trial, with his confession excluded from evidence, he was convicted. He was sentenced to 20–30 years in prison, but was paroled in 1972. After his release, he returned to his old neighborhood and made a modest living autographing police officers&#x27; &quot;Miranda cards&quot; that contained the text of the warning for reading to arrestees. Miranda was stabbed to death during an argument in a bar in Phoenix, Arizona on January 31, 1976. A Mexican man, Eseziquiel Moreno Perez, was charged with the murder of Miranda, but fled to Mexico and has never been located.

==Early life==
Ernesto Arturo Miranda was born in Mesa, Arizona, on March 9, 1941. Miranda began getting in trouble when he was in grade school. Shortly after his mother died, his father remarried. Miranda and his father did not get along very well; he kept his distance from his brothers and stepmother as well. Miranda&#x27;s first criminal conviction was during his eighth-grade year. The following year, he was convicted of burglary and sentenced to a year in reform school.

In 1956, about a month after his release from the Arizona State Industrial School for Boys (ASISB), he ran afoul of the law once more and was returned to ASISB. Upon his second release from reform school, he relocated to Los Angeles, California. Within months of his arrival in L.A., Miranda was arrested (but not convicted) on suspicion of armed robbery and for some sex offences. After two and a half years in custody, the 18-year-old Miranda was extradited back to Arizona.

He drifted through the southern U.S. for a few months, spending time in jail in Texas for living on the street without money or a place to live, and was arrested in Nashville, Tennessee, for driving a stolen car. Miranda was sentenced to one year and a day in the federal prison system because he had driven the stolen vehicle across state lines. He spent his sentence in Chillicothe, Ohio, and later in Lompoc, California.

For the next couple of years, Miranda kept out of jail, working at various jobs, until he became a laborer on the night loading dock for the Phoenix Produce Company. At that time he started living with Twila Hoffman, a 29-year-old mother of a boy and a girl by another man, from whom she could not afford to obtain a divorce.

==Confession without rights; &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;==
On March 13, 1963, Miranda&#x27;s truck was spotted and license plates recognized by the brother of an 18-year-old kidnapping and rape victim, Lois Ann Jameson (the victim had given the brother a description). With his description of the car and a partial license plate number, Phoenix Police Department officers Carroll Cooley and Wilfred Young confronted Miranda, who voluntarily accompanied them to the police station and participated in a police lineup. At the time, Miranda was a person of interest, but not formally in custody.

After the lineup, when Miranda asked how he did, the police implied that he was positively identified, at which point he was placed under arrest, and taken to an interrogation room. After two hours of interrogation, some of which regarded another offense for which Miranda was separately tried and convicted, Miranda hand-wrote a confession to the kidnapping and rape of Jameson. At the top of each sheet was the printed certification that &quot;this statement has been made voluntarily and of my own free will, with no threats, coercion or promises of immunity and with full knowledge of my legal rights, understanding any statement I make can and will be used against me.&quot; After confessing to the officers, Miranda was taken to meet the victim for positive voice identification. Asked by officers in her presence whether this was the victim, he said: &quot;That&#x27;s the girl.&quot; The victim stated that the sound of Miranda&#x27;s voice matched that of the culprit.

Despite the printed statement on top of the sheets that Miranda used to write his confession, &quot;with full knowledge of my legal rights,&quot; he was not informed of his right to have an attorney present, nor of his right to remain silent when he was arrested or before his interrogation. 73-year-old Alvin Moore was assigned to represent him at his trial. The trial was conducted in mid-June 1963 before Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Yale McFate.

Moore objected to entering the confession by Miranda as evidence during the trial but was overruled. Mostly because of the confession, Miranda was convicted of rape and kidnapping and sentenced to 20 to 30 years in prison on both charges. Moore appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court, but the conviction was upheld there.

Filing as a pauper, Miranda submitted his plea for a writ of &quot;certiorari&quot;, or request for review of his case to the U.S. Supreme Court in June 1965. After Alvin Moore was unable to continue representing Miranda because of health reasons, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) attorney Robert J. Corcoran asked John J. Flynn, a criminal defense attorney, to serve &quot;pro bono&quot;, along with his partner, John P. Frank, and associates Paul G. Ulrich and Robert A. Jensen of the law firm Lewis &amp; Roca in Phoenix to represent Miranda. They wrote a 2,500-word petition for &quot;certiorari&quot; arguing that Miranda&#x27;s Fifth Amendment rights had been violated, and they submitted it to the United States Supreme Court.

==&quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;==

In November 1965, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Miranda&#x27;s case, &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;, along with three other similar cases to clear all confusion created by the decision in &quot;Escobedo v. Illinois&quot;. That previous case had ruled that: 
Under the circumstances of this case, where a police investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect in police custody who has been refused an opportunity to consult with his counsel and who has not been warned of his constitutional right to keep silent, the accused has been denied the assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, and no statement extracted by the police during the interrogation may be used against him at a trial. &quot;Crooker v. California&quot;, 357 U.S. 433, and &quot;Cicenia v. Lagay&quot;, 357 U.S. 504, distinguished, and, to the extent that they may be inconsistent with the instant case, they are not controlling. 479–492.

In January 1966, Flynn and Frank submitted their argument stating that Miranda&#x27;s Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated by the Phoenix Police Department. Two weeks later the State of Arizona responded by asserting that Miranda&#x27;s rights had not been violated. The first day of the case was on the last day of February 1966. Because of the three companion cases and other information, the case had a second day of oral arguments on March 1, 1966.

John Flynn for Miranda outlined the case and then stated that Miranda had not been advised of his right to remain silent when he had been arrested and questioned, adding the Fifth Amendment argument to his case. Flynn contended that an emotionally disturbed man like Miranda, who had a limited education, should not be expected to know his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself.

Gary Nelson represented the State of Arizona arguing that this was not a Fifth Amendment issue but just an attempt to expand the Sixth Amendment &quot;Escobedo&quot; decision. He urged the justices to clarify their position, but not to push the limits of &quot;Escobedo&quot; too far. He then told the court that forcing police to advise suspects of their rights would seriously obstruct public safety.

The second day concerned arguments from related cases. Thurgood Marshall, the former NAACP attorney, was the last to argue. In his capacity as the Solicitor General, he presented the Johnson administration&#x27;s view of the case: that the government did not have the resources to appoint a lawyer for every indigent person who was accused of a crime.

Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote the opinion in &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;. The decision was in favor of Miranda. It stated that:
The person in custody must, prior to interrogation, be clearly informed that he has the right to remain silent, and that anything he says will be used against him in court; he must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation, and that, if he is indigent, a lawyer will be appointed to represent him.

The opinion was released on June 13, 1966. Because of the decision, police departments throughout the U.S. started to issue &quot;Miranda&quot; warning cards for their officers to recite. The Supreme Court did not mandate a specific wording and, although word choice is similar, the exact language used varies between jurisdictions. A generic admonition might look like this:
==Life after &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;==


The Supreme Court invalidated Miranda&#x27;s conviction, which was tainted by the use of the confession that had been obtained through improper interrogation. The state of Arizona retried him. At the second trial, his confession was not introduced into evidence, but he was convicted again, on March 1, 1967, based on testimony given by his estranged common-law wife. He was sentenced to 20 to 30 years in prison.

Miranda was paroled in 1972. After his release, he started selling autographed &quot;Miranda&quot; warning cards for $1.50. Over the next few years, Miranda was arrested numerous times for minor driving offenses and eventually lost his license. He was arrested for the possession of a gun but the charges were dropped. However, because this violated his parole, he was sent back to Arizona State Prison for another year before being released.

==Death==
On January 31, 1976, a fight erupted at the Amapola Bar at 233 South 2nd Street in downtown Phoenix in which Miranda was stabbed. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center. He was 34. Several Miranda cards were found on his person. Miranda was buried in the City of Mesa Cemetery in Mesa, Arizona. The person suspected of handing the knife to the man who murdered Miranda invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and refused to talk to police. He was released and was not charged in Miranda&#x27;s murder. The man suspected of murdering Miranda, then-23-year-old Eseziquiel Moreno Perez, was formally charged with murder on February 4, 1976. However, he has never been apprehended as he fled to Mexico following the murder and has never been found.

<doc id="612018" wikidata="Q939084" url="?curid=612018" title="The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas">
<text>The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas is a 2000 American romantic comedy film directed by Brian Levant, written by Jim Cash, Harry Elfont, Deborah Kaplan, and Jack Epps, Jr., and is the prequel to Levant&#x27;s &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (1994), based on the 1960–1966 animated television series of the same name. The film was developed and produced without the involvement of Steven Spielberg, the executive producer of Levant&#x27;s &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (1994). It is set before the events of both the series and the first film, showing how Fred and Barney meet Wilma and Betty. The title is a play on the Elvis Presley song, &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;, also used as the title of an MGM musical film.

With the exception of Irwin Keyes as Joe Rockhead, none of the original cast from the first film reprise their roles in this film. The film stars Mark Addy as Fred Flintstone, Stephen Baldwin as Barney Rubble, Kristen Johnston as Wilma Slaghoople, and Jane Krakowski as Betty O&#x27;Shale, replacing John Goodman, Rick Moranis, Elizabeth Perkins, and Rosie O&#x27;Donnell respectively. The supporting cast features Joan Collins, Thomas Gibson, Harvey Korman (in his final film performance), and Alan Cumming as both The Great Gazoo and Mick Jagged, a parody of Mick Jagger. William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, who created the original cartoon series, make cameo appearances at the end of the film.

The film was a box office failure, grossing $59.5 million against its $83 million budget. It received generally negative reviews, though some critics considered it an improvement over the first film.

== Plot ==
In prehistoric suburban Bedrock, young bachelors and best friends Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble have recently qualified as crane operators at Slate &amp; Company. Soon to be employed, they hope to score dates. The Great Gazoo, a small, green alien exiled to Earth by his species, offers them help, although only they can see him. Meanwhile, Wilma Slaghoople, the daughter of a wealthy military veteran, wants a normal life, though her controlling mother Pearl wants her to marry suave casino owner Chip Rockefeller. She runs away from home and meets waitress Betty O&#x27;Shale at the restaurant Bronto King in downtown Bedrock. With Wilma unable to pay for her meal, Betty assumes her to be &quot;caveless&quot; and offers to buy her lunch. Wilma moves into Betty&#x27;s apartment and gets a job as a fellow waitress.

Smitten with the waitresses, the two men invite them to a carnival, with Fred dating Betty and Barney taking Wilma. However, the couples fail to bond until both men switch dates. At one game, Fred wins an egg that hatches into a dog-like baby dinosaur, which he names &quot;Dino&quot;. Wilma invites her new friends home to a birthday party for her father, Colonel Slaghoople, where all are shocked by her wealth. Intending to propose, Fred changes his mind after meeting Chip, who mocks his low-level job at Slate &amp; Company. Pearl despises the three new friends, but the Colonel, glad for Wilma&#x27;s happiness, accepts them and privately gives Wilma a valuable pearl necklace that his great-grandmother once wore. After the boys humiliate themselves at dinner, Wilma, nevertheless, proclaims her pride and follows them out.

Chip congratulates Fred on attracting Wilma, apologizes for lampooning Fred&#x27;s job, and invites the group to his Rock Vegas resort as an olive branch. However, unbeknownst to the group, Chip plots to ensure Fred gambles so Wilma dumps him, whereas Fred sees it as a chance to win big so he can impress Wilma with money like Chip&#x27;s. Gangsters Big Rocko and Little Rocko visit Chip and his girlfriend Roxie to collect a sum of money that Chip owes their boss. Gazoo overhears Chip claiming his upcoming marriage to Wilma will allow him to access the Slaghoople fortune. Considering that the plan is creditable, the gangsters agree to suspend collections until after the wedding. When Barney tries to keep Fred from high-stakes poker, Chip sends Roxie to seduce and escort Barney to an all-you-can-eat buffet.

Chip keeps Fred gambling and he misses his dinner date with the others. Betty sees Barney wipe the cream off Roxie&#x27;s chest, misinterpreting the gesture as a pass. Mick Jagged comforts Betty, and they go on a date. Wilma breaks up with Fred over not spending any time with her. Chip warns her of burglaries and arranges for Fred to lose everything before slipping Wilma&#x27;s pearls into Fred&#x27;s pocket and framing him for stealing them. Hotel security arrests Fred for robbery, but when Barney protests that Fred is incapable of robbery, Chip accuses Barney of being Fred&#x27;s accomplice and also has him arrested. Believing Chip&#x27;s lies, Wilma goes back to him.

Gazoo visits the men in prison, revealing that Chip is severely indebted to the mob and hopes to solve both his problems by framing Fred for the robbery and marrying Wilma to get his hands on the Slaghooples&#x27; money. Barney slips through the bars, steals the keys, and unlocks the cell. Disguised in drag as dancers, they accidentally run into Jagged&#x27;s dressing room. Barney tells Betty he loves her, and they reconcile after the misunderstanding involving Roxie at the buffet is cleared up.

Fred plans to disguise himself as Jagged in an attempt to reconcile with Wilma. Meanwhile, in the audience, Chip proposes to an unimpressed Wilma. Fred then comes on stage disguised as Jagged and briefly sings to Wilma, apologizing for his behavior earlier before proposing to her. Knowing she still loves Fred, Wilma happily accepts, rejecting Chip, and they marry in the Rock Vegas Chapel of Love. After the pastor proclaims them husband and wife, everyone sings &quot;Meet the Flintstones&quot;. When Jagged sings &quot;Viva Rock Vegas&quot; at a party, Betty catches Wilma&#x27;s tossed bouquet and kisses Barney. The newlyweds drive away with Dino and Gazoo to goodbye waves from their friends, family, and even a handcuffed Chip and Roxie.

== Production ==
After the financial success of the first film, Universal Pictures initially greenlit two sequels to &quot;The Flintstones&quot; to be filmed back to back in the vein of &quot;Back to the Future: Part II&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;. John Goodman refused to reprise his role, out of fear of typecasting. Brian Levant then retooled the film into a prequel. Though there were never concrete plans for a sequel, Levant later mused that it might have followed The Flintstones going to the old west, which Levant compared to films by The Marx Brothers, The Three Stooges, and Buster Keaton. The film was also originally planned to be a full-blown musical, which Universal refused. Levant was still able to include three musical numbers in the film.

Korman, who played Wilma&#x27;s father Colonel Slaghoople, voiced The Great Gazoo in the animated series and also voiced the Dictabird in the first film. Stephenson, who voiced both the Showroom announcer and the Minister, voiced Mr. Slate in the animated series. John Goodman, Rick Moranis, Elizabeth Perkins, and Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, who played Fred, Barney, Wilma, and Betty respectively in the first film, did not reprise their roles.

Alan Cumming was the first actor cast. He was initially only supposed to play Gazoo, but after performing as Mick Jagged for the table read, it was decided he would play both roles. The film was originally meant to be a sequel to the first film.

== Music ==
Ann-Margret, who had a guest appearance on the original animated series as the title character in &quot;Ann-Margrock Presents&quot;, sings the theme song, a slightly rewritten version of &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;.

The song &quot;This isn&#x27;t love&quot; was written by Brian Wilson and Tony Asher. A full version appears on Wilson&#x27;s Live at the Roxy Theatre.

== Release ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas&quot; opened theatrically on April 28, 2000, and earned $10,518,435 in its first weekend, ranking second to &quot;U-571&quot;″s second weekend. The film ended its run on August 17, 2000, having grossed $35,268,275 domestically and $24,200,000 overseas for a worldwide total of $59,468,275. Based on an $83 million budget, the film was a box office failure. This was a disappointment compared to the first film&#x27;s $358.5 million worldwide gross.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas&quot; has a 25% score, based on 72 reviews, with an average rating of 4/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;The prequel to the first full-length feature set in Bedrock, &quot;Viva Rock Vegas&quot; is a surprising improvement over &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. Aimed towards an audience of adults and children alike, critics feel &quot;Viva&quot; will appeal to a broad range of viewers.&quot; Metacritic reports a 27 out of 100 ratings, based on 26 reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale, the same rating as its predecessor.

<text>Nazi songs are songs and marches created by the Nazi Party. In modern Germany, the public singing or performing of songs exclusively associated with the Nazi Party is now illegal.

==Background==
There is often confusion between songs written specifically for the Nazi Party, and much older German patriotic songs (from before World War I) that were used extensively by the Nazis and have become associated with them. This observation applies above all to &quot;Das Lied der Deutschen&quot; (&quot;The song of the Germans&quot;), written in 1841. It became the national anthem of the Weimar Republic in 1922, but during the Nazi era, only the first stanza was used, followed by the SA song &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot;.

In modern Germany, the public singing or performing of songs identified exclusively with Nazi Germany is illegal. It can be punished with up to three years of imprisonment.

== &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) songs==
Many pre-1933 SA songs were based on older German folk melodies, but there were also instances in which SA combat songs copied the melodies of rival Red Front Fighters songs, which were in turn based on Russian marches. An example of this is the fascist song &quot;Brüder in Zechen und Gruben&quot; (&quot;Brothers in mines and pits&quot;), which copied the melody of the communist &quot;Brüder, zur Sonne, zur Freiheit&quot; (&quot;Brothers, to the sun, to freedom&quot;), whose melody, in turn, belonged to the march Смело, товарищи, в ногу/&quot;Smelo, tovarishchi, v nogu&quot; (&quot;Comrades, let&#x27;s bravely march&quot;), which was written in 1895/6 by Leonid Radin in Moscow&#x27;s Taganka Prison.

=== &quot;Horst Wessel Lied&quot; ===

The &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot; (&quot;Song of Horst Wessel&quot;), also known as &quot;Die Fahne Hoch&quot; (&quot;The Flag Raised&quot;), was the official anthem of the NSDAP. The song was written by Horst Wessel, a party activist and SA leader, who was killed by a member of the Communist Party of Germany. After his death, he was proclaimed a &quot;martyr&quot; by the NSDAP, and his song gained widespread popularity among Nazi Party followers.

Public performances of the song are currently forbidden in Germany (StGB §86a) and Austria (Verbotsgesetz 1947), a ban that includes both the lyrics and the melody, which are only permitted for educational purposes.

===&quot;Kampflied der Nationalsozialisten&quot;===
&quot;Kampflied der Nationalsozialisten&quot; (&quot;Battle Song of the National Socialists&quot;), also known by its opening line &quot;Wir Sind Das Heer Vom Hakenkreuz&quot; (&quot;We Are the Army of the Swastika&quot;), was an early Nazi hymn. Its lyrics were written by Kleo Pleyer, while the melody was essentially based on that of the traditional German folk song &quot;Stimmt an mit hellem hohen klang&quot;, which was composed in 1811 by Albert Methfessel. Later on, the verses of &quot;Das Berliner Jungarbeiterlied&quot; (with the opening line &quot;Herbei zum Kampf, ihr Knechte der Maschinen&quot;) were added to the song. &quot;Das Berliner Jungarbeiterlied&quot; was set to the melody of the &quot;Air March&quot; (the official march of the Soviet Air Force), which was composed in 1921 by Yuliy Abramovich Khayt. During the Nazi era, the song was performed by Carl Woitschach&#x27;s orchestra in its full version, incorporating both melodies, as &quot;Kampflied der Nationalsozialisten/Herbei zum Kampf&quot;.

=== &quot;Die Hitlerleute&quot; (&quot;Kameraden Laßt Erschallen&quot;) ===
&quot;Kameraden Laßt Erschallen&quot; (&quot;Comrades Let it Resound&quot;) was a Sturmabteilung arrangement of the Kaiserjägerlied written by Karl Mühlberger in 1924. The author of the lyrics of Die Hitlerleute was Horst Wessel himself, and the song originated from his unit, the Sturm 67/5 (Sturm 67, Standarte 5) of the Berlin Sturmabteilung, also known as the Sturm &quot;Horst Wessel&quot;, named in honor of Horst Wessel, also known by its old name before Horst Wessel&#x27;s death, &quot;The Hitlerleute&quot;. The first recording of the song was published by the company Electrola around the early 1930s.

=== &quot;Auf, Hitlerleute, schließt die Reihen&quot; (&quot;Hitlernationale&quot;)===
The Nazis were not reticent in employing songs and melodies previously associated wholly with socialists and communists in their quest to broaden their appeal to the working class, and the Internationale was a prime target. By 1930, a Nazi version of this working-class standard was in circulation, entitled the &quot;Hitlernationale&quot;:

Appropriating working-class songs such as the Internationale for their own political ends had a direct effect on the streets, as the Nazi composer Hans Bajer noted when giving this account of a march by the SA into working-class district of north Berlin one Sunday afternoon in 1930:

When the storm troopers broke into song, singing the &quot;Hitlernationale&quot;, residents threw open their windows, misled momentarily by the familiar tune. Realizing quickly that Nazis were trying to appropriate the melody of their revolutionary anthem, the socialist residents countered by singing the refrain from the original text &quot;Völker hört die Signale! Auf zum letzten Gefecht&quot; (&quot;Comrades, listen to the Signal! Onward, to the final battle!&quot;), while others pelted the storm troopers with bits of debris. Police promptly moved in to prevent serious trouble.

Bajer’s account proves once more that song played a central role in the battle for control of the streets. No recorded version of the song survives today, only the lyrics.

=== &quot;Hitlerleute&quot; (&quot;Hitler&#x27;s people&quot;) ===
That song had the same tune of the Italian fascist anthem &quot;Giovinezza&quot;.

This is not to be confused with &quot;Die Hitlerleute&quot;, more commonly referred to as &quot;Kameraden Laßt Erschallen&quot;, which is a completely different song.

== &quot;SS marschiert in Feindesland &quot; ==
&quot;SS marschiert in Feindesland&quot; (&quot;SS marches in enemy territory&quot;) also known as &quot;Teufelslied&quot; (&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Song&quot;) was a marching song of the Waffen-SS during the German-Soviet War. The music for this song came from the &quot;Lied der Legion Condor&quot; (&quot;Song of the Condor Legion&quot;), whose lyrics and music were written by Wolfram Philipps and Christian Jährig, two Condor Legion pilots with the rank of &quot;Oberleutnant&quot;. The somber music has a minor character, and the song was &quot;exposed to the accusation of being un-German, Russian or Bolshevik&quot;. In 1939, the &quot;Lied der Legion Condor&quot; was incorporated into a march named &quot;Marsch/Parademarsch der Legion Condor&quot; after an instrumental intro was composed by &quot;Stabsmusikmeister&quot; Karl Bögelsack. This march has two parts: the first (major) part is the instrumental intro composed by Karl Bögelsack, and the second part (trio) is the &quot;Lied der Legion Condor&quot;, which was composed/written by Wolfram Philipps and Christian Jährig. A marching song with the same melody as the &quot;Lied der Legion Condor&quot; was adopted by the Charlemagne French SS Division, the Estonian SS Division, the Latvian Legion and the Norwegian Legion during the war. A song with a similar melody, &quot;Dragões do Ar&quot; (&quot;Dragons of the Air&quot;), was adopted by the Paratroopers Brigade (Brazil).

In 2013, Stefan Gotschacher, press secretary of the right-wing populist and national-conservative FPÖ political party in Austria, was fired after posting the lyrics of &quot;SS marschiert in Feindesland&quot; on his Facebook page.

== &quot;Es zittern die morschen Knochen&quot; ==
&quot;Es zittern die morschen Knochen&quot; (&quot;The Rotten Bones Are Trembling&quot;) by Hans Baumann was, after the &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot;, one of the most famous Nazi songs and the official song of the Hitler Youth.

The original song&#x27;s refrain (1932) was &quot;Denn heute gehört uns Deutschland / und morgen die ganze Welt&quot; (&quot;For today, Germany is ours / and tomorrow the whole world&quot;). In a later version (1937) this was mitigated for the Hitler Youth to &quot;Denn heute da hört uns Deutschland...&quot; (&quot;For today, Germany hears us...&quot;).

==&quot;Vorwärts! Vorwärts!&quot;==
&quot;Vorwärts! Vorwärts! Schmettern die hellen Fanfaren&quot; (&quot;Forward! Forward! Blare the Bright Fanfares&quot;) was a Hitler Youth marching song. The text of the song, published in 1933, comes from Baldur von Schirach and is based on a melody by UFA composer Hans-Otto Borgmann.

&quot;Vorwärts! Vorwärts!&quot; was first performed in the 1933 propaganda film &quot;Hitlerjunge Quex&quot;. Motifs from the song are used throughout the film, underlying representations of the Hitler Youth, in contrast to The Internationale and jazz motifs in scenes from a socialist &quot;commune&quot;.

== &quot;Erika&quot; ==

&quot;Erika&quot; is a marching song used by the German military. The song was composed by Herms Niel in the 1930s, and it soon came into usage by the Wehrmacht, especially the Heer. No other marching song during World War II reached the popularity of &quot;Erika&quot;.

==&quot;Panzerlied&quot;==
&quot;Panzerlied&quot; (&quot;Tank song&quot;) was a German military march of the Wehrmacht armored troops (Panzerwaffe), composed in 1933. The NSKK (&quot;Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps&quot;) also made their own take on the &quot;Panzerlied&quot;, but with a different variation called the &quot;Panzerwagenlied&quot; (&quot;Armored car song&quot;). In 2017, the Bundeswehr was banned from publishing songbooks containing &quot;Panzerlied&quot; and other marching songs by the Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen as part of new efforts at denazification.

==Other music==
* &quot;Erzherzog-Albrecht-Marsch&quot;
* &quot;Es war ein Edelweiss&quot;
* &quot;Sturmlied&quot;
* &quot;Volk ans Gewehr&quot;

<text>Fergus is the largest community in Centre Wellington, a township within Wellington County in Ontario, Canada. It lies on the Grand River about 18 km NNW of Guelph. The population of this community at the time of the 2016 Census was 20,767, but the community is growing as new homes are being built for sale.

Fergus was an independent town until 1999 when the Township was formed by amalgamating the Town of Fergus, the Village of Elora, and the Townships of Nichol, Pilkington, West Garafraxa, and part of Eramosa.

==History==

The first settlers to this area were freed slaves, who formed what was known as the Pierpoint Settlement, named after their leader, Richard Pierpoint, a United Empire Loyalist originally from Bondou, Senegal in Africa. Along with a half dozen other men who had also fought with the British during the American Revolutionary War, Pierpoint was granted land in Garafraxa Township somewhere around what is now Scotland Street in Fergus.

Another settlement was founded nearby in 1833 and was first called Little Falls because of the scenic (water) falls, now between the Public Library and the Fergus Market. The primary developers were Adam Fergusson and James Webster, who had purchased 28 km² (7,000 acres) of land. Both were later lawyers by profession. The first bridge over the river in the heart of the settlement was built in 1834 by Fergusson.

The first house was built in 1833, a hotel was built in 1844 and in 1835, a sawmill, grist-mill, church and school were opened. The post office was established in 1836. Fergusson was also a founder of the first curling club in Ontario; it was opened in 1834, and is still active today. After 1838, Scottish settlers purchased the land in what was previously Pierpoint Settlement.

James Webster was the one who opened the Fergus Mills and cleared a great deal of land for farming. Alexander Dingwall Fordyce joined Ferguson and they controlled all of the industry in Fergus until 1855. Until approximately 1850, an unwritten policy of restricted growth was implemented. Because Fergusson, Webster and some other Scottish emigrants owned the land, only Scots could purchase village lots. However, in order to accommodate Irish settlers, Webster founded the town of Arthur (just north of Fergus) in 1840. By 1846 the settlement had 21 businesses. The population was 184 mostly of Scots.The community had a church and a post office and several tradesmen.

James Wilson arrived in 1855 and opened an oatmeal mill, then a flour mill, then a saw mill and then a woolen mill and a factory, Monkland Mills, that supplied oatmeal for export. They and other Scots living in the settlement established a booming economy using the waterfalls on the Grand River to power local industry. They built solid stone houses, factories and other buildings which still characterize Fergus. Many of the buildings from the 1800s are still in use today. In addition to Scots, the other settlers in this area were Irish or freed slaves from the U.S.

In 1858, the settlement, with a population of 1,000, was incorporated as a village called Fergus in honour one of its founders, Adam Fergusson. By 1869 the population was 1,500.

On November 29, 1890, electricity became available in the village through the efforts of Dr. Abraham Groves. More extensive provision of power, by Ontario Hydro, began in 1914.

Fergus was a centre for agricultural equipment manufacturing under Beatty Brothers Limited, which was founded by George and Matthew Beatty in 1874. Originally from Albion Township, the brothers acquired an earlier equipment manufacturer in the area, Grindley, and began producing their own lines of farm equipment. The company spearheaded the transition from small-scale local artisan manufacturing of farm equipment of the mid- to late-19th century to standardized product lines, large factory floors, and national distribution of products that characterized the era of Fordism. By the turn of the century, the company&#x27;s operations, centred around the Foundry building (most recently in use as the Fergus Marketplace), dominated downtown Fergus. Around this time the company began to transition to appliance manufacturing and away from its roots in farm equipment, taking advantage of the growing suburban consumer market of the mid-20th century. With heavy competition from American manufacturers like Westinghouse, however, the company was ultimately taken over in successive mergers starting in the 1960s, which culminated in the final closure of the last remaining ex-Beatty plant in Fergus in 2013.

The first library, built with a Carnegie grant, opened in 1911 and is in the register of Canada&#x27;s Historic Places. In 1953, the village was incorporated as the &quot;Town of Fergus&quot; and in 1999 became a part of the Township of Centre Wellington.

===From &quot;poorhouse&quot; to museum===
In 1877, the County opened the Wellington County House of Industry and Refuge, or Poorhouse as it was called, on Wellington Road 18 between Fergus and Elora. Over the years, approximately 1500 &quot;deserving&quot; poor, including those who were destitute, old and infirm or suffering from disabilities were housed here. The sixty bed house for &quot;inmates&quot; was surrounded by a 30-acre &quot;industrial&quot; farm with a barn for livestock that produced some of the food for the 70 residents and the staff and also provided work for them. Others worked in the House itself. According to a 2009 report by the Toronto Star, &quot;pauperism was considered a moral failing that could be erased through order and hard work&quot;. A hospital was added in 1892. A nearby cemetery has 271 plots for those who died. In 1947 the House was converted into the Wellington County Home for the Aged and in 1975 the building reopened as the Wellington County Museum and Archives.

A historic plaque was erected at the museum, indicating that the &quot;government-supported poorhouse&quot; was &quot;the shelter of last resort for the homeless and destitute, who traded spartan accommodations for domestic or agricultural labour&quot;.

==Geography==

Fergus is located north-northwest of Guelph and sits on the Grand River. It is near many natural settings such as the Elora Gorge and Conservation Area, and Belwood Lake.

The club plays in the Ontario Rugby Union, and has two Men&#x27;s teams, two Women&#x27;s teams and a strong and growing junior program. Fergus Curling Club, Ontario&#x27;s oldest continuously running Curling Club, was founded in 1834 by settlers from Scotland. Adam Fergusson was the first president. Matches were held outdoors until 1879 when an indoor rink was opened.

St Andrew Street runs parallel to the Grand River (on its north side) and is the heart of downtown. In addition to stores and restaurants, the Fergus Grand Theatre is located here, on the south side of the street. Originally a cinema that opened in 1928, the venue now hosts live entertainment and stage plays. On the south side of the river is Queen Street where the Fergus Market on the River (no longer a farmers&#x27; market) houses shops located in restored historic warehouses.

The Wellington County Museum and Archives and the Wellington County library are in nearby Aboyne, halfway between Fergus and Elora. The museum is located in a two-storey Italianate-style stone building on a former working farm. The building is the oldest known state-supported poorhouse or almshouse in Canada. It was called the House of Industry and Refuge when it opened in 1877. Subsequently, the home switched to caring for the elderly and chronically ill, eventually closing in 1971. The building was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1995.

Nearby attractions include the Elora Gorge, Elora Quarry Conservation Area, the Elora Cataract Trailway for hiking, the County Museum and Elora Gorge Falls in addition to Grand River Raceway.

<text>KASUMI is a block cipher used in UMTS, GSM, and GPRS mobile communications systems.
In UMTS, KASUMI is used in the confidentiality (&quot;f8&quot;) and integrity algorithms (&quot;f9&quot;) with names UEA1 and UIA1, respectively.
In GSM, KASUMI is used in the A5/3 key stream generator and in GPRS in the GEA3 key stream generator.

KASUMI was designed for 3GPP to be used in UMTS security system by the Security Algorithms Group of Experts
(SAGE), a part of the European standards body ETSI.
Because of schedule pressures in 3GPP standardization, instead of developing a new cipher, SAGE agreed with 
3GPP technical specification group (TSG) for system aspects of 3G security (SA3) to base the development
on an existing algorithm that had already undergone some evaluation.
They chose the cipher algorithm MISTY1 developed
and patented
by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation.
The original algorithm was slightly modified for easier hardware implementation and to
meet other requirements set for 3G mobile communications security.

KASUMI is named after the original algorithm MISTY1 — (hiragana , romaji &quot;&quot;) is the Japanese word for &quot;mist&quot;.

In January 2010, Orr Dunkelman, Nathan Keller and Adi Shamir released a paper showing that they could break Kasumi with a related-key attack and very modest computational resources; this attack is ineffective against MISTY1.

==Description==

KASUMI algorithm is specified in a 3GPP technical specification.
KASUMI is a block cipher with 128-bit key and 64-bit input and output. 
The core of KASUMI is an eight-round Feistel network. The round functions
in the main Feistel network are irreversible Feistel-like network
transformations. In each round the round function uses a round key
which consists of eight 16-bit sub keys
derived from the original 128-bit key using a fixed key schedule.

===Key schedule===

The 128-bit key &quot;K&quot; is divided into eight 16-bit sub keys &quot;Ki&quot;:

formula_1

Additionally a modified key &quot;K&quot;&#x27;, similarly divided into 16-bit
sub keys &quot;K&#x27;i&quot;, is used. The modified key is derived from
the original key by XORing with 0x123456789ABCDEFFEDCBA9876543210 (chosen as a &quot;nothing up my sleeve&quot; number).

Round keys are either derived from the sub keys by bitwise rotation to left
by a given amount and from the modified sub keys (unchanged).

The round keys are as follows:

formula_2

Sub key index additions are cyclic so that if &quot;i+j&quot; is greater than 8
one has to subtract 8 from the result to get the actual sub key index.

===The algorithm===
KASUMI algorithm processes the 64-bit word in two 32-bit halves, left (formula_3)
and right (formula_4).
The input word is concatenation of the left and right halves of the first round:

formula_5.

In each round the right half is XOR&#x27;ed with the output of the round function
after which the halves are swapped:

formula_6

where &quot;KLi&quot;, &quot;KOi&quot;, &quot;KIi&quot; are round keys
for the &quot;i&quot;th round.

The round functions for even and odd rounds are slightly different. In each case
the round function is a composition of two functions &quot;FLi&quot; and &quot;FOi&quot;.
For an odd round

formula_7

and for an even round

formula_8.

The output is the concatenation of the outputs of the last round.

formula_9.

Both &quot;FL&quot; and &quot;FO&quot; functions divide the 32-bit input data to two 16-bit halves.
The &quot;FL&quot; function is an irreversible bit manipulation while the &quot;FO&quot; function is
an irreversible three round Feistel-like network.

====Function FL====

The 32-bit input &quot;x&quot; of formula_10 is divided to two 16-bit halves formula_11.
First the left half of the input formula_12 is ANDed bitwise with round key formula_13 and rotated
left by one bit. The result of that is XOR&#x27;ed to the right half of the input formula_14 to get the right
half of the output formula_15.

formula_16

Then the right half of the output formula_15 is ORed bitwise with the round key formula_18 and rotated
left by one bit. The result of that is XOR&#x27;ed to the left half of the input formula_12 to get the left
half of the output formula_20.

formula_21

Output of the function is concatenation of the left and right halves formula_22.

====Function FO====

The 32-bit input &quot;x&quot; of formula_23 is divided into two 16-bit halves formula_24, and passed through three rounds of a Feistel network.

In each of the three rounds (indexed by &quot;j&quot; that takes values 1, 2, and 3) the left half is modified
to get the new right half and the right half is made the left half of the next round.

formula_25

The output of the function is formula_26.

====Function FI====
The function &quot;FI&quot; is an irregular Feistel-like network.

The 16-bit input formula_27 of the function formula_28 is divided to two halves formula_24
of which formula_30 is 9 bits wide and formula_31 is 7 bits wide.

Bits in the left half formula_30 are first shuffled by 9-bit substitution box (S-box) &quot;S9&quot; and the result is XOR&#x27;ed with
the zero-extended right half formula_31 to get the new 9-bit right half formula_34.

formula_35

Bits of the right half formula_31 are shuffled by 7-bit S-box &quot;S7&quot; and the result is XOR&#x27;ed with
the seven least significant bits (&quot;LS7&quot;) of the new right half formula_34 to get the new 7-bit left half formula_38.

formula_39

The intermediate word formula_40 is XORed with the round key KI to get formula_41
of which formula_42 is 7 bits wide and formula_43 is 9 bits wide.

formula_44

Bits in the right half formula_43 are then shuffled by 9-bit S-box &quot;S9&quot; and the result is XOR&#x27;ed with
the zero-extended left half formula_42 to get the new 9-bit right half of the output formula_47.

formula_48

Finally the bits of the left half formula_42 are shuffled by 7-bit S-box &quot;S7&quot; and the result is XOR&#x27;ed with
the seven least significant bits (&quot;LS7&quot;) of the right half of the output formula_47 to get the 7-bit left
half formula_51 of the output.

formula_52

The output is the concatenation of the final left and right halves formula_53.

====Substitution boxes====

The substitution boxes (S-boxes) S7 and S9 are defined by both bit-wise AND-XOR expressions and look-up tables in the specification.
The bit-wise expressions are intended to hardware implementation but nowadays it is customary to use
the look-up tables even in the HW design.

S7 is defined by the following array:
int S7[128] = {
 54, 50, 62, 56, 22, 34, 94, 96, 38, 6, 63, 93, 2, 18,123, 33,

S9 is defined by the following array:
int S9[512] = {

==Cryptanalysis==

In 2001, an impossible differential attack on six rounds of KASUMI was presented by Kühn (2001).

In 2003 Elad Barkan, Eli Biham and Nathan Keller demonstrated man-in-the-middle attacks against the GSM protocol which avoided the A5/3 cipher and thus breaking the protocol. This approach does not attack the A5/3 cipher, however. The full version of their paper was published later in 2006.

In 2005, Israeli researchers Eli Biham, Orr Dunkelman and Nathan Keller published a related-key rectangle (boomerang) attack on KASUMI that can break all 8 rounds faster than exhaustive search.
The attack requires 254.6 chosen plaintexts, each of which has been encrypted under one of four related keys, and has a time complexity equivalent to 276.1 KASUMI encryptions. While this is obviously not a practical attack, it invalidates some proofs about the security of the 3GPP protocols that had relied on the presumed strength of KASUMI.

In 2010, Dunkelman, Keller and Shamir published a new attack that allows an adversary to recover a full A5/3 key by related-key attack. The time and space complexities of the attack are low enough that the authors carried out the attack in two hours on an Intel Core 2 Duo desktop computer even using the unoptimized reference KASUMI implementation. The authors note that this attack may not be applicable to the way A5/3 is used in 3G systems; their main purpose was to discredit 3GPP&#x27;s assurances that their changes to MISTY wouldn&#x27;t significantly impact the security of the algorithm.

<text>The second USS &quot;Cummings&quot; (DD-365) was a in the United States Navy, named for Andrew Boyd Cummings. She was a Pacific-based vessel, performing patrol and escort duties before and during World War II. The ship was present during the Attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese on 7 December 1941, though she escaped major damage or casualties. &quot;Cummings&quot; was decommissioned in 1945 and sold for scrap in 1947.

==History==
&quot;Cummings&quot; was launched 11 December 1935 at the United Shipyards, Inc., New York. The ship was sponsored by Mrs. W. W. Mills, niece of Lieutenant Commander Cummings, and commissioned 25 November 1936.

Departing New York 29 September 1937, &quot;Cummings&quot; arrived at San Diego 28 October to join the Battle Force. She participated in the fleet problem in Hawaiian waters in April 1938, and a Presidential Fleet Review at San Francisco in July. In 1939, the exercises were held in the Panama Canal Zone and the Caribbean from January to April. Returning to San Diego 12 May 1939, &quot;Cummings&quot; participated in flotilla and fleet training, and served as plane guard for the carriers &quot;Yorktown&quot; (CV-5) and &quot;Lexington&quot; (CV-2). When the security patrol was begun on the west coast in 1940, &quot;Cummings&quot; served on it, intermittently, while continuing to conduct exercises in anti-aircraft and submarine tactics and target practice.

&quot;Cummings&quot; was based in Pearl Harbor on 26 April 1940. Except for a west coast overhaul and cruises to Tutuila, Samoa, Auckland, New Zealand, and Tahiti between 4 March and 3 April 1941, she remained in Hawaiian waters conducting patrols and constantly exercising and drilling. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, &quot;Cummings&quot; weathered the bombs that fell ahead and astern, receiving only minor casualties from fragments, and sortied on patrol almost immediately. From 19 December 1941 to 4 May 1942, &quot;Cummings&quot; escorted convoys between Pearl Harbor and San Francisco. Then sailed between Suva, Fiji Islands, and Auckland, New Zealand, from 9 June to 13 August on similar duty.

After overhaul in San Francisco, &quot;Cummings&quot; escorted a convoy to Noumea and Wellington, New Zealand, in November 1942. The ship began patrol and escort missions for the Guadalcanal operation from bases at Espiritu Santo and Nouméa until 17 May 1943, and then sailed to Auckland, New Zealand, for a brief overhaul. &quot;Cummings&quot; Returned to Nouméa 4 June and screened transports to Auckland in July, and served at Efate from 5 August until 4 September.

Overhauled on the west coast again, &quot;Cummings&quot; joined TF 94 to patrol off Adak, Alaska, between 1 and 16 December, before she returned to Pearl Harbor 21 December.

===1944===
Assigned to the 5th Fleet, &quot;Cummings&quot; sortied on 19 January 1944 for operations in the Marshall Islands, accompanying carriers for air strikes on Wotje and Eniwetok until 21 February. She sailed from Majuro 4 March for Trincomalee, Ceylon, where she rendezvoused 31 March with British ships for exercises. &quot;Cummings&quot; sailed with British Force 70 to screen during air strikes on Sabang, Sumatra, on 19 April. She returned to Ceylon until 6 May and then cleared for Exmouth Gulf, Australia. With British Force 66, &quot;Cummings&quot; sortied 15 May for air strikes on Soerabaja, Java, then she left the British forces and returned to Pearl Harbor via Sydney.

Arriving at San Francisco 7 July 1944, &quot;Cummings&quot; sailed 21 July, escorting President Franklin D. Roosevelt aboard &quot;Baltimore&quot; (CA-68) to Pearl Harbor, Adak, and Juneau. The President and his staff came aboard &quot;Cummings&quot; 8 August for transportation to Seattle and upon arrival 12 August, President Roosevelt broadcast a nationwide address from the forecastle of &quot;Cummings&quot;.

Departing Seattle 13 August 1944, &quot;Cummings&quot; joined TG 12.5 at Pearl Harbor for an air strike and shore bombardment of Wake Island on 3 September. With the 3d Fleet, &quot;Cummings&quot; joined the bombardment of Marcus Island on 9 October. Then she screened the escort carriers that launched the supporting air strikes on Luzon, Cebu, Leyte, Samar, Negros, and engaged the Japanese in the decisive Battle of Leyte Gulf. &quot;Cummings&quot; took part in the bombardment of Iwo Jima on 11 and 12 November, and she then returned to Saipan 21 November for local duty.

&quot;Cummings&quot; interrupted this duty to join the repeated strikes on Iwo Jima from 8 December 1944 to 19 March 1945, supplying fire support for the invading troops. She was stationed off Iwo Jima and, occasionally, escorted convoys to Saipan and Guam until the end of the war. &quot;Cummings&quot; duties included local convoy escort and control duty, and the air-sea rescue work that accompanied the intensified strikes on Okinawa and the Japanese home islands. She supervised the occupation of Haha Jima on 9 September, then the ship sailed from Iwo Jima 19 September for San Pedro, California, Tampa, Florida, and Norfolk, Virginia. &quot;Cummings&quot; was decommissioned 14 December 1945 and sold 17 July 1947.

<doc id="612029" wikidata="Q2304023" url="?curid=612029" title="Cyclic model">
<text>A cyclic model (or oscillating model) is any of several cosmological models in which the universe follows infinite, or indefinite, self-sustaining cycles. For example, the oscillating universe theory briefly considered by Albert Einstein in 1930 theorized a universe following an eternal series of oscillations, each beginning with a Big Bang and ending with a Big Crunch; in the interim, the universe would expand for a period of time before the gravitational attraction of matter causes it to collapse back in and undergo a bounce.

== Overview ==
In the 1920s, theoretical physicists, most notably Albert Einstein, considered the possibility of a cyclic model for the universe as an (everlasting) alternative to the model of an expanding universe. In 1922, Alexander Friedmann introduced the Oscillating Universe Theory. However, work by Richard C. Tolman in 1934 showed that these early attempts failed because of the cyclic problem: according to the second law of thermodynamics, entropy can only increase. This implies that successive cycles grow longer and larger. Extrapolating back in time, cycles before the present one become shorter and smaller culminating again in a Big Bang and thus not replacing it. This puzzling situation remained for many decades until the early 21st century when the recently discovered dark energy component provided new hope for a consistent cyclic cosmology. In 2011, a five-year survey of 200,000 galaxies and spanning 7 billion years of cosmic time confirmed that &quot;dark energy is driving our universe apart at accelerating speeds.&quot;

One new cyclic model is the brane cosmology model of the creation of the universe, derived from the earlier ekpyrotic model. It was proposed in 2001 by Paul Steinhardt of Princeton University and Neil Turok of Cambridge University. The theory describes a universe exploding into existence not just once, but repeatedly over time. The theory could potentially explain why a repulsive form of energy known as the cosmological constant, which is accelerating the expansion of the universe, is several orders of magnitude smaller than predicted by the standard Big Bang model.

A different cyclic model relying on the notion of phantom energy was proposed in 2007 by Lauris Baum and Paul Frampton of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Other cyclic models include conformal cyclic cosmology and loop quantum cosmology.

== The Steinhardt–Turok model ==

In this cyclic model, two parallel orbifold planes or M-branes collide periodically in a higher-dimensional space. The visible four-dimensional universe lies on one of these branes. The collisions correspond to a reversal from contraction to expansion, or a Big Crunch followed immediately by a Big Bang. The matter and radiation we see today were generated during the most recent collision in a pattern dictated by quantum fluctuations created before the branes. After billions of years the universe reached the state we observe today; after additional billions of years it will ultimately begin to contract again. Dark energy corresponds to a force between the branes, and serves the crucial role of solving the monopole, horizon, and flatness problems. Moreover, the cycles can continue indefinitely into the past and the future, and the solution is an attractor, so it can provide a complete history of the universe.

As Richard C. Tolman showed, the earlier cyclic model failed because the universe would undergo inevitable thermodynamic heat death. However, the newer cyclic model evades this by having a net expansion each cycle, preventing entropy from building up. However, there remain major open issues in the model. Foremost among them is that colliding branes are not understood by string theorists, and nobody knows if the scale invariant spectrum will be destroyed by the big crunch. Moreover, as with cosmic inflation, while the general character of the forces (in the ekpyrotic scenario, a force between branes) required to create the vacuum fluctuations is known, there is no candidate from particle physics.

== The Baum–Frampton model ==
This more recent cyclic model of 2007 assumes an exotic form of dark energy called phantom energy, which possesses negative kinetic energy and would usually cause the universe to end in a Big Rip. This condition is achieved if the universe is dominated by dark energy with a cosmological equation of state parameter formula_1 satisfying the condition formula_2, for energy density formula_3 and pressure p. By contrast, Steinhardt–Turok assume formula_4. In the Baum–Frampton model, a septillionth (or less) of a second (i.e. 10−24 seconds or less) before the would-be Big Rip, a turnaround occurs and only one causal patch is retained as our universe. The generic patch contains no quark, lepton or force carrier; only dark energy – and its entropy thereby vanishes. The adiabatic process of contraction of this much smaller universe takes place with constant vanishing entropy and with no matter including no black holes which disintegrated before turnaround.

The idea that the universe &quot;comes back empty&quot; is a central new idea of this cyclic model, and avoids many difficulties confronting matter in a contracting phase such as excessive structure formation, proliferation and expansion of black holes, as well as going through phase transitions such as those of QCD and electroweak symmetry restoration. Any of these would tend strongly to produce an unwanted premature bounce, simply to avoid violation of the second law of thermodynamics. The condition of formula_5 may be logically inevitable in a truly infinitely cyclic cosmology because of the entropy problem. Nevertheless, many technical back up calculations are necessary to confirm consistency of the approach. Although the model borrows ideas from string theory, it is not necessarily committed to strings, or to higher dimensions, yet such speculative devices may provide the most expeditious methods to investigate the internal consistency. The value of formula_1 in the Baum–Frampton model can be made arbitrarily close to, but must be less than, −1.

== Other cyclic models ==
* Conformal cyclic cosmology—a general relativity based theory by Roger Penrose in which the universe expands until all the matter decays and is turned to light—so there is nothing in the universe that has any time or distance scale associated with it. This permits it to become identical with the Big Bang, so starting the next cycle.
* Loop quantum cosmology which predicts a &quot;quantum bridge&quot; between contracting and expanding cosmological branches.

<doc id="612032" wikidata="Q523893" url="?curid=612032" title="Ichthyosis">
<text>Ichthyosis (also named fish scale disease) is a family of genetic skin disorders characterized by dry, thickened, scaly skin. The more than 20 types of ichthyosis range in severity of symptoms, outward appearance, underlying genetic cause and mode of inheritance (e.g., dominant, recessive, autosomal or X-linked). Ichthyosis comes , since dry, scaly skin is the defining feature of all forms of ichthyosis.

The severity of symptoms can vary enormously, from the mildest, most common, types such as ichthyosis vulgaris, which may be mistaken for normal dry skin, up to life-threatening conditions such as harlequin-type ichthyosis. Ichthyosis vulgaris accounts for more than 95% of cases.

==Types==
Many types of ichthyoses exist, and an exact diagnosis may be difficult. Types of ichthyoses are classified by their appearance, if they are syndromic or not, and by mode of inheritance. For example, non-syndromic ichthyoses that are inherited recessively come under the umbrella term autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI).

Ichthyosis caused by mutations in the same gene can vary considerably in severity and symptoms. Some ichthyoses do not appear to fit exactly into any one type while mutations in different genes can produce ichthyoses with similar symptoms. Of note, X-linked ichthyosis is associated with Kallmann syndrome (close to the &quot;KAL1&quot; gene). The most common or well-known types are:

=== Non-syndromic ichthyosis ===
=== Syndromic ichthyosis===
=== Non-genetic ichthyosis ===
*Ichthyosis acquisita

==Diagnosis==
A physician often can diagnose ichthyosis by looking at the skin. A family history is also useful in determining the mode of inheritance. In some cases, a skin biopsy is done to help to confirm the diagnosis while in others genetic testing may be helpful in making a diagnosis. Diabetes has not been definitively linked to acquired ichthyosis or ichthyosis vulgaris; however, there are case reports associating new onset ichthyosis with diabetes.

Ichthyosis has been found to be more common in Native American, Asian, Mongolian groups. There is no way to prevent ichthyosis.

Ichthyosis is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disease that can be isolated and restricted to the skin manifestations or associated with extracutaneous symptoms, one of which is limb reduction defect known as CHILD syndrome, a rare inborn error of metabolism of cholesterol biosynthesis that is usually restricted to one side of the body. One case with symptoms matching CHILD syndrome has been described as having a likely-different cause.

==Treatments==
Treatments for ichthyosis often take the form of topical application of creams and emollient oils, in an attempt to hydrate the skin. Creams containing a high percentage of urea or lactic acid have been shown to work exceptionally well in some cases. Application of propylene glycol is another treatment method. Retinoids are used for some conditions.

Exposure to sunlight may improve or worsen the condition. In some cases, excess dead skin sloughs off much better from wet tanned skin after bathing or a swim, although the dry skin might be preferable to the damaging effects of sun exposure.

There can be ocular manifestations of ichthyosis, such as corneal and ocular surface diseases. Vascularizing keratitis, which is more commonly found in congenital keratitis-ichythosis-deafness (KID), may worsen with isotretinoin therapy.

==Other animals==
Ichthyosis or ichthyosis-like disorders exist for several types of animals, including cattle, chickens, llamas, mice, and dogs. Ichthyosis of varying severity is well documented in some popular breeds of domestic dogs. The most common breeds to have ichthyosis are Golden Retrievers, American bulldogs, Jack Russell terriers, and Cairn terriers.

<doc id="612034" wikidata="Q429399" url="?curid=612034" title="Highland games">
<text>Waipu Highland games () is a competitive strength sport with events held in spring and summer in Scotland and several other countries with a large Scottish diaspora as a way of celebrating Scottish and Celtic culture, especially that of the Scottish Highlands. Certain aspects of the games are so well known as to have become emblematic of Scotland, such as the bagpipes, the kilt, and the heavy events, especially the stone put, Scottish hammer throw, weight throw, weight over bar, caber toss, keg toss and sheaf toss. While centred on competitions in piping and drumming, dancing, and Scottish heavy athletics, the games also include entertainment and exhibits related to other aspects of Scottish and Gaelic cultures.

The Cowal Highland Gathering, better known as the Cowal Games, is held in Dunoon, Scotland, every August. It is the largest Highland games in Scotland, attracting around 3,500 competitors and somewhere in the region of 23,000 spectators from around the globe. Worldwide, however, it is exceeded in terms of spectators by three gatherings in the United States: the estimated 30,000 that attend Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina; the New Hampshire Highland Games &amp; Festival, which attracts over 35,000 annually; and the even larger Northern California gathering—the largest in the Northern Hemisphere—that has taken place every year since 1866. This event, the Scottish Highland Gathering and Games, is currently held on Labor Day weekend in Pleasanton, California; and the sesquicentennial event was held on 5–6 September 2015, attracting a record crowd close to 50,000.

Highland games are claimed to have influenced Baron Pierre de Coubertin when he was planning the revival of the Olympic Games. De Coubertin saw a display of Highland games at the Paris Exhibition of 1889.

== History ==
===Ancient games===
The first historical reference to the type of events held at Highland games in Scotland was made during the time of King Malcolm III (, c. 1031 – 13 November 1093) when he summoned men to race up Craig Choinnich overlooking Braemar with the aim of finding the fastest runner in Scotland to be his royal messenger. There is a document from 1703 summoning the clan of the Laird of Grant, Clan Grant. They were to arrive wearing Highland coats and &quot;also with gun, sword, pistol and dirk&quot;. From this letter, it is surmised that the competitions would have included feats of arms. There are also thought to have been events where the strongest and bravest soldiers in Scotland would be tested. Musicians and dancers were encouraged to reveal their skill and talents and so be a great credit to the clan that they represented. Some modern sources suggest more these games would originate from the deer hunts that the inhabitants of the Highlands engaged in.

Attempts have been made to discover earlier traditions of games, although evidence is thin. The primary sources are from the bardic traditions of both contests between clans and of tests to select retainers for clan chiefs.
An example of a possible early games venue is at Fetteresso.

===Modern games===
 
The modern Highland games are largely a 19th-century development, from the period following the Jacobite rebellions and subsequent ban on Highland dress.

By the mid-20th century, annual Highland games events, modelled on the traditional events in Scotland along with some elements borrowed from the festivals, had been established not just in Scotland but throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, among other places with a notable Scottish diaspora, which totals about 50 million people worldwide. (The earliest such events in North America go back quite a way, to 1836 in New York and at least 1863 in Nova Scotia.) The modern, rather commercialised gatherings have done much to promote tartan, kilts, and other elements of Highland culture abroad, having up to tens of thousands of attendees, a large proportion of them in Highland dress. The games are the primary source of business for a cottage industry of professional kiltmakers outside of Scotland, and are the main recruiting grounds of the numerous clan societies.

While the Scottish Highland Games Association says there are dozens of such events in Scotland, there were at least 260 annual Highland games events worldwide as of 2000, more than 100 of them in the US alone, and dozens more in Canada. They are closely intertwined with bagpipe band competitions (which date to 1781), a lasting source of Highland imagery in their regiment-inspired uniforms; the 2013 World Pipe Band Championships in Glasgow drew over 8,000 pipers and drummers from all over the world.

The games&#x27; rather flamboyantly tartaned subculture, a &quot;shortcut to the Highlands&quot;, is sustained outside Scotland primarily by multi-generational Scottish descendants rather than by direct Scottish expatriates. Sir Malcolm MacGregor, chief of Clan Gregor and then convenor of the Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs (well aware of tartan&#x27;s connections to tourism and other Scottish economic interests) wrote in 2016 of the games events beyond Scotland that &quot;it is the stuff of kilts and cabers, but it is the Scotland those not living in Scotland want it to be.&quot; Ian Brown (2012) coined the term &quot;tartanism&quot; (as distinct from &quot;tartanry&quot;) for this international tokenisation of tartan, kilts, and other symbols of the Highlands as ethnic-identity markers, evolving to some degree independently to suit the cultural needs of the New World Scottish diaspora and unrestrained by the views of the originating Scottish &quot;home&quot; culture. Michael B. Paterson (2001) hypothesises that the fondness for Highland symbols and activities among the diaspora may be due to the European-descended populations in these countries lacking much of a direct experience of culture deeper than a few generations, and being dominated by nuclear family structure; Highland games, clan tartans, Burns suppers, St Andrew&#x27;s societies (more than 1,200 of them just in the US), etc. provide a sense of shared roots, heritage, identity, and a broader and more elastic notion of family, as well as fostering Old World, &quot;mother country&quot; connections. Fiona K. Armstrong (2017) writes: &quot;It is a feudal longing in a modern age. It is a yearning for some supposedly comforting and ordered past.&quot; According to Ian Maitland Hume (2001):

This swell of diasporic tartan enthusiasm seems to have been triggered in the 1950s, the beginning of the age of affordable powered flight, as clan chiefs like Dame Flora MacLeod of Clan MacLeod travelled abroad to promote Scottish tourism and other connections. (At least 1 in 5 Scottish-descended people surveyed in 2017 by VisitScotland, the national tourism board, expressed an interest in travelling to Scotland.) However, in 2009, the US-based Council of Scottish Clans and Associations reported a drop in the number of active clan societies (which peaked at 170, and drive considerable tourism as well as historic-place restoration efforts), with up to a 25% decrease in individual memberships, as well as some of the annual games events coming to an end; &quot;new technology&quot; (i.e. the Internet) seemed to be related.

== Events ==
=== Heavy events ===
In their original form centuries ago, Highland games revolved around athletic and sports competitions. Though other activities were always a part of the festivities, many today still consider Highland athletics to be what the games are all about—in short, that the athletics are the games, and all the other activities are just entertainment. Regardless, it remains true today that the athletic competitions are at least an integral part of the events.

==== Stone put/ putting the heavy stone ====
Similar to the modern-day shot put as seen in the Olympic Games, instead of a steel shot, a large stone of variable weight is often used. There are two versions, differing in allowable technique: The Braemar Stone uses a 20–30 lb (9.1–13.6 kg) stone for men (13–18 lb or 6–8 kg for women) and does not allow any run up to the toeboard or &quot;trig&quot; to deliver the stone, i.e., it is a standing put. In the Open Stone using a 16–25 lb (7.3–11.4 kg) stone for men (8–12 lb or 3.5–5.5 kg for women), the thrower is allowed to use any throwing style so long as the stone is put with one hand with the stone resting cradled in the neck until the moment of release. Most athletes in the open stone use either &quot;glide&quot; or &quot;spin&quot; technique.

==== Scottish hammer throw ====
This event is seen as the precursor to the modern hammer throw seen in track and field events worldwide. However the Highland Games version has some differences. In the Scottish event, a round metal ball weighing 16 or 22 lb (7.25 or 10 kg) for men, or 12 or 16 lb (5.5 or 7.25 kg) for women, is attached to the end of a shaft about 4 feet (1.2 metres) in length and made out of wood, bamboo, rattan or plastic. With the feet in a fixed position, the hammer is whirled about one&#x27;s head and thrown for distance over the shoulder. Hammer throwers sometimes employ specially designed footwear with flat blades to dig into the turf to maintain their balance and resist the centrifugal forces of the implement as it is whirled about the head. It substantially increases the attainable distance.

==== Weight throw/ weight for distance ====
This event has two variations (usually considered two separate events) to it, depending on the weight of the implement. One using a light ( for men and for women) and the other a heavy ( for men, for masters men, and for women) weight. The weights are made of metal and have a handle attached either directly or by means of a chain. The implement is thrown using one hand only, but otherwise using any technique. Usually a spinning technique is employed. The longest throw wins.

==== Weight over bar/ weight for height ====
In this event, the athletes toss either a 25.4 kg (56 lb/ 4-stone) weight for men, 19 kg (42 lb) for masters men, and 12 kg (28 lb) for women, a weight with an attached handle over a horizontal bar using only one hand. It requires the weight to be kept between the legs before swinging it up in a pendulum like manner, and releasing when it is at its apex, directly overhead. Each athlete is allowed three attempts at each height. Successful clearance of the height allows the athlete to advance into the next round at a greater height. The competition is determined by the highest successful toss with fewest misses being used for tie-breakers. It is also used in some Strongman competitions.

==== Caber toss ====
In this staple event, competitors toss a large tapered pole called a &quot;caber&quot; () usually made from a larch trees. The term &quot;caber&quot; derives from the Gaelic word &quot;cabar&quot;, which refers to a wooden beam. It can be between tall and weigh . The primary objective is to toss the caber so that it turns end over end, falling away from the tosser. Ideally it should fall directly away from the tosser in the &quot;12 o&#x27;clock&quot; position. The movement can be broken down to several segments. The tosser first balances the caber upright against his or her shoulder and neck (tapered end should be downwards). The tosser then crouches, sliding their interlocked hands down the caber and under the rounded base, and lifts it in their cupped hands. The tosser then walks or runs a few paces forward to gain momentum, and flips the tapered end upwards so that the large end hits the ground first, and if well tossed, the caber falls directly away from the tosser. The judging of Caber toss might be deceptive. The straightest end-over-end toss scores highest. If the caber lands on its end but falls back towards the thrower, the score is lower than for any end-over-end throw, but is based upon the maximum vertical angle that the caber achieved (side-judging may involve a second judge). End-over-end tosses are scored according to the hours on a clock, with a 12 o&#x27;clock score being highest (falling directly away from the thrower), down to a 9 or 3 for cabers that reach a vertical, before falling to the side.

==== Keg toss ====

This event which is predominately evolving from Irish Highland games, involves the heaving of a standard half-barrel beer keg over a horizontal bar using both hands. The keg is completely emptied for better stability and to avoid injuries. The basic technique involves swinging the keg in a pendulum like manner and releasing when it is at its apex. The event or its modified variations are quite often used in modern day Strongman competitions. In 2010 World&#x27;s Strongest Man the 8 keg standardization was introduced where the competitors had to throw 8 beer kegs of increasing weights ranging from 17 to 24 kg over a 4-meter bar. Keg for maximum height is also a staple Highland games and Strongman event with 12.5 kg, 15 kg and 25 kg being the most common weights used. 

==== Sheaf toss ====
In this event, a bundle of straw (the sheaf) weighing for the men and for the women, and wrapped in a burlap bag is tossed vertically with a pitchfork over a raised bar much like that used in pole vaulting. The progression and scoring of this event is similar to the Weight over bar. However, there is significant debate among athletes as to whether the sheaf toss is in fact an authentic Highland event. Some argue it is actually a country fair event, but many agree that it is a great crowd pleaser. It is also a traditional sport in the Basque Country, and is often featured at agricultural shows such as the annual Sykehouse Show in South Yorkshire, England.

==== Maide-leisg ====
 (Gaelic for &#x27;lazy stick&#x27;, ) is a trial of strength performed by two competitors sitting on the ground with the soles of their feet pressing against each other. Thus seated, they hold a stick between their hands which they pull against each other until one of them is raised from the ground. The oldest competition in the world takes place at the Carloway show and Highland games on the Isle of Lewis. There&#x27;s also a popular variation of the event performed in Yakuts communities often called Mas-wrestling.

=== Music ===


For many Highland games festival attendees, the most memorable of all the events at the games is the massing of the pipe bands. Normally held in conjunction with the opening and closing ceremonies of the games, as many as 20 or more pipe bands will march and play together. The result is a thunderous rendition of &quot;Scotland the Brave&quot; or &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, and other crowd-pleasing favorites.

The music of the great Highland bagpipe has come to symbolize music at the games and of Scotland itself. In addition to the massed bands (when all the attending pipe bands play together), nearly all Highland games gatherings feature a wide range of piping and drumming competition, including solo piping and drumming, small group ensembles and full the pipe bands.

Music at Highland games gatherings also includes other forms, such as fiddling, harp circles, and Celtic bands.

=== Dance ===
The Cowal Highland Gathering hosts the annual World Highland Dancing Championship. This event gathers the best competitive dancers from around the world who compete for the RSOBHD sanctioned World Championship title. But most other Highland Games have dancing as well. The impressiveness of the performance varies wildly depending on the section dancing, with the 4/5/6 year old Primary dancers bringing the cuteness but not necessarily the technique compared to the 10-30+ year olds that are typical of the Premier (Open) section. The dances performed can vary quite a lot depending on the size of the dancing boards, access to swords for dancing over, and just preference of which dances to perform. Among the most common dances are the Highland Fling, the Sword Dance or the Ghillie Callum, the Seann Triubhas, the Irish Jig and the Hornpipe. Of these dances three (Highland Fling, Sword Dance, and Seann Triubhas) are performed wearing the semi-traditional kilt whilst the Irish Jig and the Hornpipe have specific outfits for their dances.

=== Secondary events and attractions ===
At modern-day Highland Games events, a wide variety of other activities and events are generally available. Foremost among these are the clan tents and vendors of Scottish related goods. The various clan societies make the Highland games one of the main focus of their seasonal activities, usually making an appearance at as many such events as possible. Visitors can find out information about the Scottish roots and can become active in their own clan society if they wish. These are more common at Highland Games held outside of Scotland as there is less of a demand for them in Scotland, which is not to say that they do not pop up from time to time.

At modern games, armouries will display their collections of swords and armour, and often perform mock battles. Various vendors selling Scottish memorabilia are also present selling everything from Irn-Bru to the stuffed likeness of the Loch Ness Monster.

Herding dog trials and exhibitions are often held, showcasing the breeder&#x27;s and trainer&#x27;s skills. In addition, there may be other types of Highland animals present, such as the Highland cattle.

Various traditional and modern Celtic arts are often showcased. These could include harpers&#x27; circles, Scottish country dancing, and one or more entertainment stages. In addition, most events usually feature a pre-event ceilidh (a type of social event with traditional music, dancing, song, and other forms of entertainment).

Various food vendors will also offer assorted types of traditional Scottish refreshment and sustenance.

==In popular culture==
The Highland games phenomenon is satirised by Neil Munro in his Erchie MacPherson story, &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, first published in the &quot;Glasgow Evening News&quot; on 22 August 1904.

<text>Bùi Tín (29 December 1927 – 11 August 2018) was a Vietnamese dissident and People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) colonel, serving in the PAVN general staff. After the war, he became disillusioned by corruption and the continuing isolation of the newly unified Vietnam. He decided to leave Vietnam and live in exile in Paris to express his growing dissatisfaction with the Communist Party of Vietnam and their political system.

==Early life and education==
Tín was born near Hanoi on 29 December 1927, and was educated in Huế.

==Career==
During the August Revolution in 1945, Tín became an active supporter to politically pressure the government of France to cede Vietnam its independence. He later joined the Việt Minh along with Chairman Hồ Chí Minh and General Võ Nguyên Giáp. He would fight on two sides of the line, using both weapons and his skills as a journalist for the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army newspaper. He enlisted in the Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army at age 18. He was wounded during the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu.

Tín would serve on the general staff of the army. During the Vietnam War, he had authority from Defense Minister Võ Nguyên Giáp to visit any of the camps where American Prisoners of War (PoW) were held, meet with the camp officers, look at the PoW files, and interview the PoW&#x27;s. During at least one such occasion, he was involved in an interrogation of John McCain.

Tín was with the PAVN in the South in 1975, reporting for Nhân Dân. Western media often claims to have been called into service at the Fall of Saigon because of his Army rank of colonel and to have personally accepted the surrender of Dương Văn Minh and his Cabinet, this was disputed by the Vietnamese government as well as by Tín himself, claiming the act to Colonel Bùi Văn Tùngvi].

After the war ended, he went on to serve as the Vice Chief Editor of the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; (&quot;Nhân Dân&quot;, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Vietnam), responsible for the &quot;Sunday People&#x27;s&quot; (&quot;Nhân Dân Chủ Nhật&quot;). He became disillusioned in the mid-1980s with postwar corruption and the continuing isolation of Vietnam. In 1990, Tín decided to leave Vietnam and emigrated to Paris, deciding to stay after being invited by the French newspaper L&#x27;Humanité after becoming disillusioned with the Communist Party of Vietnam and Vietnam&#x27;s political system.

In November 1991, Tín became involved in the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue when he appeared before hearings of the United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs in Washington, D.C. He stated that, &quot;I can say that I know as well as any top leader in Vietnam and, in my opinion, I state categorically that there is not any American prisoner alive in Vietnam.&quot; After his testimony, he and former PoW John McCain embraced, which produced a flurry of &quot;Former Enemies Embrace&quot; style headlines. Tín&#x27;s testimony was the subject of anticipation: when he had arrived at Dulles International Airport three weeks earlier, former U.S. Congressman Bill Hendon and a staff assistant to the committee&#x27;s vice-chair Bob Smith confronted Tín and tried to convince him that there &quot;were&quot; live prisoners in Vietnam; Tín felt it was an intimidation attempt.

Tín subsequently published two books, &quot;Following Ho Chi Minh: The Memoirs of a North Vietnamese Colonel&quot; (University of Hawaii Press, 1995) and &quot;From Enemy To Friend: A North Vietnamese Perspective on the War&quot; (U.S. Naval Institute Press, 2002).

In a 2000 PBS &quot;American Experience&quot; forum, he maintained that no captured U.S. soldiers had been tortured during their captivity in North Vietnam during the war. He conceded the same might not be true of captured United States Air Force pilots, going so far as calling some of their alleged treatment &quot;a violation of the International Agreement on Prisoner of War&quot;.

He died aged 90 in Montreuil, France on 11 August 2018.

<text>William Robinson: (15 July 1838 – 12 May 1935) was an Irish practical gardener and journalist whose ideas about wild gardening spurred the movement that led to the popularising of the English cottage garden, a parallel to the search for honest simplicity and vernacular style of the British Arts and Crafts movement, and were important in promoting the woodland garden. Robinson is credited as an early practitioner of the mixed herbaceous border of hardy perennial plants, a champion too of the &quot;wild garden&quot;, who vanquished the high Victorian pattern garden of planted-out bedding schemes. Robinson&#x27;s new approach to gardening gained popularity through his magazines and several books—particularly &quot;The Wild Garden&quot;, illustrated by Alfred Parsons, and &quot;The English Flower Garden&quot;.

Robinson advocated more natural and less formal-looking plantings of hardy perennials, shrubs, and climbers, and reacted against the High Victorian patterned gardening, which used tropical materials grown in greenhouses. He railed against standard roses, statuary, sham Italian gardens, and other artifices common in gardening at the time. Modern gardening practices first introduced by Robinson include: using alpine plants in rock gardens; dense plantings of perennials and groundcovers that expose no bare soil; use of hardy perennials and native plants; and large plantings of perennials in natural-looking drifts.

==Life and career==

Robinson began his garden work at an early age, as a garden boy for the Marquess of Waterford at Curraghmore, County Waterford. From there, he went to the estate of an Irish baronet in Ballykilcavan, County Laois, Sir Hunt Johnson-Walsh, and was put in charge of a large number of greenhouses at the age of 21. According to one account, as the result of a bitter quarrel, one cold winter night in 1861 he let the fires go out, killing many valuable plants. Other accounts consider the story to be a gross exaggeration. Whether in haste after the greenhouse incident or not, Robinson left for Dublin in 1861, where the influence of David Moore, head of the botanical garden at Glasnevin, a family friend, helped him find work at the Botanical Gardens of Regent&#x27;s Park, London, where he was given responsibility for the hardy herbaceous plants, specialising in British wildflowers.

At that time, the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Kensington gardens were being designed and planted with vast numbers of greenhouse flowers in mass plantings. Robinson wrote that &quot;it was not easy to get away from all this false and hideous &quot;art&quot;.&quot; But his work with native British plants did allow him to get away to the countryside, where he &quot;began to get an idea (which should be taught to every boy at school) that there was (for gardens even) much beauty in our native flowers and trees.&quot;

Robinson was a vegetarian but did not impose it on others.

===Writing===
In 1866, at the age of 29, he became a fellow of the Linnean Society under the sponsorship of Charles Darwin, James Veitch, David Moore, and seven other distinguished botanists and horticulturists. Two months later, he left Regents Park to write for &quot;The Gardener&#x27;s Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;, and represented the leading horticultural firm of Veitch at the 1867 Paris Exhibition. He began writing many of his publications, beginning with &quot;Gleanings from French Gardens&quot; in 1868, &quot;The Parks, Gardens, and Promenades of Paris&quot; in 1869, and &quot;Alpine Flowers for Gardens&quot;, &quot;Mushroom Culture&quot;, and &quot;The Wild Garden&quot; in 1870. In 1871 he launched his own gardening journal, simply named &quot;The Garden&quot;, which over the years included contributions from notables such as John Ruskin, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Gertrude Jekyll, William Morris, Dean Hole, Frank Miles, Canon Ellacombe, and James Britten. &quot;The Garden: An Illustrated Weekly Journal of Horticulture in All Its Branches&quot; was published from 1872 to 1927.

His most influential books were &quot;The Wild Garden&quot; (1870), which made his reputation and allowed him to start his magazine, and &quot;The English Flower Garden&quot; (1883), which he revised in edition after edition and included contributions from his long-time friend Gertrude Jekyll, among others. She later edited &quot;The Garden&quot; for a couple of years and contributed many articles to his publications, which also included &quot;Gardening Illustrated&quot; (from 1879).

He first met Jekyll in 1875—they were in accord in their design principles and maintained a close friendship and professional association for over 50 years. He helped her on her garden at Munstead Wood; she provided plants for his garden at Gravetye Manor. Jekyll wrote about Robinson that:
...when English gardening was mostly represented by the innate futilities of the &quot;bedding&quot; system, with its wearisome repetitions and garish colouring, Mr William Robinson chose as his work in life to make better known the treasures that were lying neglected, and at the same time to overthrow the feeble follies of the &quot;bedding&quot; system. It is mainly owing to his unremitting labours that a clear knowledge of the world of hardy-plant beauty is now placed within easy reach of all who care to acquire it, and that the &quot;bedding mania&quot; is virtually dead.

Robinson also published &quot;God&#x27;s Acre Beautiful or The Cemeteries of The Future&quot;, in which he applied his gardening aesthetic to urban churchyards and cemeteries. His campaign included trying to win an unwilling public to the advantages of cremation over burial, and he quite freely shared unsavoury stories of what happened in certain crowded graveyards. He was instrumental in the founding of Golders Green Crematorium and designed the gardens there, which replaced the traditional Victorian mourning graveyard with open lawn, flowerbeds, and woodland gardens.

===Gravetye Manor===

With his writing career a financial success, in 1884 Robinson was able to purchase the Elizabethan Gravetye Manor near East Grinstead in Sussex, along with about of rich pasture and woodland. His diary of planting and care was published as &quot;Gravetye Manor, or Twenty Years of the Work round an old Manor House&quot; (1911). Gravetye would find practical fulfilment of many of Robinson&#x27;s ideas of a more natural style of gardening. Eventually it would grow to nearly .

Much of the estate had been managed as a coppiced woodland, giving Robinson the opportunity to plant drifts of scilla, cyclamen, and narcissus between the coppiced hazels and chestnuts. On the edges, and in the cleared spaces in the woods, Robinson established plantings of Japanese anemone, lily, acanthus, and pampas grass, along with shrubs such as fothergilla, stewartia, and nyssa. Closer to the house he had some flower beds; throughout he planted red valerian, which he allowed to spread naturally around paving and staircases. Robinson planted thousands of daffodils annually, including 100,000 narcissi planted along one of the lakes in 1897. Over the years he added hundreds of trees, some of them from American friends Charles Sprague Sargent and Frederick Law Olmsted. Other features included an oval-shaped walled kitchen garden, a heather garden, and a water garden with one of the largest collections of water lilies in Europe.

Robinson invited several well-known painters to portray his own landscape artistry, including the English watercolourist Beatrice Parsons, the landscape and botanical painter Henry Moon, and Alfred Parsons. Moon and Parsons illustrated many of Robinson&#x27;s works.

After Robinson&#x27;s death, Gravetye Manor and the Estate were left to a publicly owned charity. In 1958, the Manor house and gardens were leased to a restaurateur who refurbished the gardens, replacing some of the flower beds with lawn. Today, the Manor serves as a hotel and restaurant. The Estate as a whole is managed by the William Robinson Gravetye Charity.

===Long-term impact on gardening===
Through his magazines and books, Robinson challenged many gardening traditions and introduced new ideas that have become commonplace today. He is most linked with introducing the herbaceous border, which he referred to by the older name of &#x27;mixed border&#x27;—it included a mixture of shrubs, hardy and half-hardy herbaceous plants. He also advocated dense plantings that left no bare soil, with the spaces between taller plants filled with what are now commonly called ground cover plants. Even his rose garden at Gravetye was filled with saxifrage between and under the roses. Following a visit to the Alps, Robinson wrote &quot;Alpine Flowers for Gardens&quot;, which for the first time showed how to use alpine plants in a designed rock garden.

His most significant influence was the introduction of the idea of naturalistic gardening, which first appeared in &quot;The Wild Garden&quot; and was further developed in &quot;The English Flower Garden&quot;. The idea of introducing large drifts of native hardy perennial plants into meadow, woodland, and waterside is taken for granted today, but was revolutionary in Robinson&#x27;s time. In the first edition, he recommended any plant that could be naturalised, including half-hardy perennials and natives from other parts of the world—thus Robinson&#x27;s wild garden was not limited to locally native species. Robinson&#x27;s own garden at Gravetye was planted on a large scale, but his wild garden idea could be realised in small yards, where the &#x27;garden&#x27; is designed to appear to merge into the surrounding woodland or meadow. Robinson&#x27;s ideas continue to influence gardeners and landscape architects today—from home and cottage gardens to large estate and public gardens.

==&quot;The Wild Garden&quot;, 1870==
In &quot;The Wild Garden&quot; Robinson set forth fresh gardening principles that expanded the idea of garden and introduced themes and techniques that are taken for granted today, notably that of &quot;naturalised&quot; plantings. Robinson&#x27;s audience were not the owners of intensely gardened suburban plots, nor dwellers in gentrified country cottages seeking a nostalgic atmosphere; nor was Robinson concerned with the immediate surroundings of the English country house. Robinson&#x27;s wild garden brought the untidy edges, where garden blended into the larger landscape into the garden picture: meadow, water&#x27;s edge, woodland edges and openings.

The hardy plants Robinson endorsed were not all natives by any means: two chapters are devoted to the hardy plants from other temperate climate zones that were appropriate to naturalising schemes. The narcissus he preferred were the small, delicate ones from the Iberian peninsula. Meadowflowers included goldenrod and asters, rampant spreaders from North America long familiar in English gardens. Nor did Robinson&#x27;s &#x27;wild&#x27; approach refer to letting gardens return to their natural state—he taught a specific gardening method and aesthetic. The nature of plants&#x27; habit of growth and their cultural preferences dictated the free design, in which human intervention was to be kept undetectable.

Without being in any sense retrograde, Robinson&#x27;s book brought attention back to the plants, which had been eclipsed since the decline of &quot;gardenesque&quot; plantings of the 1820s and 30s, during the use of tender annuals as massed colour in patterned schemes of the mid-century. The book&#x27;s popularity was largely due to Robinson&#x27;s promise that wild gardening could be easy and beautiful; that the use of hardy perennials would be less expensive and offer more variety than the frequent mass planting of greenhouse annuals; and that it followed nature, which he considered the source of all true design.

==&quot;The English Flower Garden&quot;, 1883==
In &quot;The English Flower Garden&quot;, Robinson laid down the principles that revolutionised the art of gardening. Robinson&#x27;s source of inspiration was the simple cottage garden, long neglected by the fashionable landscapists. In &quot;The English Flower Garden&quot; he rejected the artificial and the formal, specifically statuary, topiary, carpet bedding, and waterworks—comparing the modern garden to &quot;the lifeless formality of wall-paper or carpet.&quot; The straight lines and form in many gardens were seen by Robinson to &quot;carry the dead lines of the builder into the garden.&quot; He admired nature&#x27;s diversity, and promoted creepers and ramblers, smaller plantings of roses, herbaceous plants and bulbs, woodland plants, and winter flowers.

Robinson compared gardening to art, and wrote in the first chapter:
The gardener must follow the true artist, however modestly, in his respect for things as they are, in delight in natural form and beauty of flower and tree, if we are to be free from barren geometry, and if our gardens are ever to be true pictures...And as the artist&#x27;s work is to see for us and preserve in pictures some of the beauty of landscape, tree, or flower, so the gardener&#x27;s should be to keep for us as far as may be, in the fulness of their natural beauty, the living things themselves.

The first part of &quot;The English Flower Garden&quot; covered garden design, emphasising an approach that was individual and not stereotypical: &quot;the best kind of garden grows out of the situation, as the primrose grows out of a cool bank.&quot; The second part covered individual plants, hardy and half-hardy, showing artistic and natural use of each plant—with several articles included from &quot;The Garden&quot; and chapters contributed by leading gardeners of the day, including Gertrude Jekyll, who contributed the chapter on &quot;Colour in the Flower Garden&quot;

This book was first published in 1883, with the last edition published in 1933. During Robinson&#x27;s lifetime, the book found increasing popularity, with fifteen editions during his life. For fifty years, &quot;The English Flower Garden&quot; was considered a bible by many gardeners.

<doc id="612047" wikidata="Q4801044" url="?curid=612047" title="2004 Cypriot Annan Plan referendums">
<text>A referendum on the Annan Plan was held in the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on 24 April 2004. The two communities were asked whether they approved of the fifth revision of the United Nations proposal for reuniting the island, which had been divided since 1974. While it was approved by 65% of Turkish Cypriots, it was rejected by 76% of Greek Cypriots. Turnout for the referendum was high at 89% among Greek Cypriots and 87% among Turkish Cypriots, which was taken as indicative of great interest in the issue on the part of the electorates.

==Background==
The referendum had originally been planned for 21 April, until the UN planners realised it was the anniversary of the coup in Athens in 1967, which set off the chain of events that led to the Turkish invasion of the island in 1974.

==Campaign==
===Position of political parties===
===Republic of Cyprus===
Political leaders in the Republic of Cyprus strongly opposed the plan. Tassos Papadopoulos, president of the Republic of Cyprus, spoke out against the plan in a speech broadcast live on television. Two days before the referendums, Cyprus&#x27;s biggest party, Progressive Party of Working People, decided to reject the Annan Plan. Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis decided to maintain a &quot;neutral&quot; position over the plan, but opposition leader George Papandreou of PASOK urged Cypriots to vote in favour, also because the plan had been promoted by his political party while it was still in power and Papandreou had been the Foreign Minister at the time, and had claimed both communities were ready for &quot;a final common agreement&quot;. Nevertheless, opinion polls conducted in the Republic of Cyprus over the entire period of the negotiations from start to finish had always shown around 80% opposition to the proposals. Greek Cypriots have not voted uniformly on the Annan Plan.
Their voting behaviour was strongly depended on their partisanship and their location.

===Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus===
Among Turkish Cypriots the plan was argued to be excessively pro-Greek, but most said they were willing to accept it as a means of ending their prolonged international isolation and exclusion from the wider European economy. However, it was opposed by their leadership, with the Turkish Cypriot President Rauf Denktaş actively advocating a no vote. However, his Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat favoured the plan&#x27;s acceptance, while Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan also supported it. Turkey saw a resolution of the Cyprus issue as being an essential first step to eventual Turkish membership of the EU as well as a way of defusing tensions with Greece.

The Grey Wolves (a Turkish right-wing nationalist group belonging to the MHP nationalist party) actively advocated a &quot;no&quot; vote. There were some limited riots caused by Grey Wolves activists against pro-ratification supporters during the pre-vote period, with at least 50 such activists arriving in Northern Cyprus during the pre-voting period. However, the referendum itself was carried out peacefully and deemed free and fair.

==Referendum question==
The question put to the electorate of the two communities was:


==Results==
==Aftermath==
Since the Greek Cypriot Community did not approve the Plan, and implementation of the Plan was dependent on its approval by &quot;both&quot; communities, the Annan Plan, according to its own terms, became null and void.

===Participation issues===
Greek Cypriots disputed the right of Turkish Cypriots who had immigrated from Turkey since the 1974 breakaway. Following the referendum, Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos wrote to Kofi Annan, complaining that:

The British Foreign Affairs Select Committee noted that while the settler population did not &quot;swing&quot; the vote, &quot;as illegal immigrants they should not have been allowed to vote at all&quot;.

===Reaction===

====Greek Cypriots====
The Republic of Cyprus&#x27; president, Tassos Papadopoulos, said that Greek Cypriots had rejected just the Annan plan and not all solutions to the Cyprus problem. &quot;They are not turning their backs on their Turkish Cypriot compatriots,&quot; he said soon after the results were declared. &quot;They have simply rejected this particular solution on offer.&quot;

====Turkish Cypriots====
Turkish Cypriot President Rauf Denktaş responded to the referendum outcome by saying that, with the Annan Plan rejected, his &quot;no&quot; campaign had reached its objective. He rejected calls for his immediate resignation, but announced the following month that he would not be standing for a fifth presidential term in 2005.

====Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom====
There was varied reaction from Cyprus&#x27; Guarantor Powers, Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Turkey&#x27;s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that he believed the result spelled an end for Turkish Cypriot isolation, and that by rejecting the Annan Plan, &quot;southern Cyprus (was) the loser&quot;. A spokesman for the Greek government stressed that efforts to reunite Cyprus should not be halted, pointing out that in the EU framework it is &quot;in the interest of everyone to continue efforts to reconcile Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots&quot;.

The British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said, &quot;We will respect the choice which Greek Cypriots have expressed today. But I hope that they will continue to reflect on whether this choice is the right one for them.&quot; The general international reaction to the result was similar to that of Britain: one of deep disappointment, particularly among those bodies that had worked on the Annan Plan and on EU accession arrangements.

====European Union====
The European Union had been counting on approval of the Annan Plan so that Cyprus would join it as a united island, and expressed disappointment at the Greek Cypriot rejection of the Plan. It had already agreed that the Republic of Cyprus would become a member regardless of the result of the referendum, and so on May 1, 2004, Cyprus joined the European Union together with nine other countries.

With regard to the Turkish Cypriots the European Union stated the following:

Had the plan been ratified by both sides, Cyprus would have entered the EU as the United Republic of Cyprus.

====Other international reaction====

*United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan: &quot;A unique and historic chance to resolve the Cyprus problem has been missed.&quot;
*European Commission: &quot;The European Commission deeply regrets that the Greek Cypriot community did not approve the comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem, but it respects the democratic decision of the people.&quot;
*US State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher: &quot;We are disappointed that a majority of Greek Cypriots voted against the settlement plan. Failure of the referendum in the Greek Cypriot community is a setback to the hopes of those on the island who voted for the settlement and to the international community.&quot;
*European Commissioner for Enlargement Günter Verheugen: &quot;I feel cheated by the Greek Cypriot government… There is a shadow now over the accession of Cyprus. What we will seriously consider now is finding a way to end the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriots.&quot;
*UN Special Envoy Álvaro de Soto: &quot;This evening I&#x27;m biting my tongue.&quot;

<doc id="612048" wikidata="Q2297905" url="?curid=612048" title="Soho, West Midlands">
<text>Soho is an area split between the Birmingham and Sandwell metropolitan boroughs of the West Midlands in England. The area is located on the A41 road. The name is an abbreviation of South House, denoting that it was located to the south of Handsworth. The section of the A41 separating Handsworth from Winson Green is known as Soho Road.

Soho expanded dramatically during the 19th century with the construction of numerous houses and factories, and immigration from the Commonwealth was centred in these homes during the 1950s and 1960s. Most of the immigrants who settled in Soho were of Indian origin.

Further housebuilding took place by the local council during the 1960s and 1970s. Soho falls partly in the Soho ward of the City of Birmingham and partly in the Soho and Victoria ward of the Borough of Sandwell.

== Soho ward, Birmingham ==
Until 1911 the part now within Birmingham formed part of Handsworth District, and is now a ward within the council constituency of Ladywood.

===Demography===
The 2001 Population Census found that 25,634 people were living in Soho with a population density of 5,369 people per km2 compared with 3,649 people per km2 for Birmingham. Soho covers an area of 4.8 km2. The ward is a very ethnically diverse area with ethnic minorities making up 76.2% (19,522) of the ward&#x27;s population, compared with 29.6% for Birmingham.

==== Ethnicity Population ====
*White British – 20.48%
*White Irish – 2.20%
*White Other – 1.17%
*Mixed: White and Black Caribbean – 2.80%
*Mixed: White and Black African – 0.22%
*Mixed: White and Asian – 0.81%
*Mixed: Other – 0.95%
*Indian – 26.77%
*Pakistani – 13.99%
*Bangladeshi – 3.88%
*Other Asian – 2.31%
*Afro-Caribbean – 18.13%
*African – 1.44%
*Other Black – 2.42%
*Chinese – 0.69%

===Politics===
Soho Ward is represented by three Labour councillors on Birmingham City Council; Sybil Spence, Chaman Lal and Dorothy Hargreaves.

Soho Ward has adopted a Ward Support Officer with the current holder of the title being Tariq M. Khan.

In 2014, James Turner Street, in the Winson Green area of the ward featured in the TV series &quot;Benefits Street&quot;.

== Places of interest ==
Industrialist Matthew Boulton opened his &quot;Soho Manufactory&quot; (an early factory) there in 1761. Boulton himself resided at Soho House, now a community museum of the Birmingham Museums &amp; Art Gallery run by Birmingham City Council.

The parish church is dedicated to St John Chrysostom. The area is served by Handsworth Library.

Winson Green Prison and City Hospital are located within the Winson Green area of the ward.

Soho is home to a Train Care Depot and the Soho Foundry, which was Matthew Boulton and James Watt’s famous factory. Most of the rest of the area is industrial with some housing.

==Transport==
Soho had stations on the London &amp; North Western Railway built Stour Valley Line between Smethwick Rolfe Street and the closed Winson Green railway station, and on the Great Western Railway between Handsworth &amp; Smethwick and Hockley (replaced by Jewellery Quarter). It is currently served by the West Midlands Metro on the former GWR line with a stop at Soho Benson Road.

<doc id="612051" wikidata="Q4891329" url="?curid=612051" title="Beretta 21A Bobcat">
<text>The Beretta 21A Bobcat is a semi-automatic pocket pistol designed by Beretta in Italy. Production began in the late 1984, solely in the Beretta U.S.A. facility in Accokeek, Maryland. It is a further development of the Beretta Model 20, whose production ended in 1985.

==Design==
The Beretta 21A Bobcat is available chambered for either .22 LR or .25 ACP (6.35 mm) ammunition. It has a simple blowback operation, with a single- and double-action trigger mechanism, and exposed hammer. It has a magazine release button in the left side grip, located between the grip retaining screws. The frame is made out of aluminum alloy; the slide and barrel are either carbon steel or stainless steel, depending on the model. According to Beretta, the pistol is intended for off duty police and pistol carry permit holders that seek a highly concealable, but reliable pistol designed for self-defense.

==Intended market==
The Beretta 21a chambered in .22 LR or .25 ACP is a pistol that’s intended for undercover agents, as backup for police officers, for individuals licensed to carry a concealed firearm or just for plinking and/or sport shooting. 

==Safety features==
It is fitted with a frame-mounted, thumb-operated rear-locking safety, which also blocks the slide. This can be applied with the hammer fully down, or cocked. The hammer has a half-cock safety notch. There is an inertia type firing pin design.

==Unique features==
One defining feature of this pistol is the &#x27;tip-up&#x27; barrel. The barrel pivots on a pin under the muzzle so that the chamber may be loaded with the slide in the closed position. It is released by a lever on the left side of the frame, above the trigger. This simplifies loading, unloading, and checking load status, as the slide can be difficult for some people to retract by hand.
The Bobcat was designed without an extractor, relying on pressure from the expanding gases of the fired cartridge to simply blow spent cases from the chamber. This makes it particularly sensitive to choice of ammunition for dependable operation.

The weapon design creates a unique ejection path. Instead of ejecting spent brass to the side as do most semi-automatic hand guns, the Bobcat ejects the spent brass backwards and up.

==Variants==
The Bobcat 21A is available in either .22 LR with 7-round magazine capacity or .25 ACP (6.35 mm) with 8-round magazine capacity. The .22 LR version is currently available in either matte black (Beretta&#x27;s &quot;Bruniton&quot; finish) or stainless steel (&quot;Inox&quot;) versions. The .25 ACP model is available in black only.

In the .22 LR &quot;Inox&quot; version (introduced in 2000) only the barrel and slide are stainless steel, and the alloy frame has a matte light gray Bruniton coating. The remainder of the gun is unchanged.
