<text>USS &quot;Savannah&quot; (CL-42) was a light cruiser of the that served in World War II in the Atlantic and Mediterranean theatres of operation. &quot;Savannah&quot; conducted Neutrality Patrols (1941) and wartime patrols in the Atlantic and Caribbean (1942), and supported the invasion of French North Africa in Operation Torch (November 1942). She sought German-supporting blockade runners off the east coast of South America (1943), and supported the Allied landings on Sicily and at Salerno (1943). Off Salerno on 11 September 1943, a German radio-controlled Fritz X glide-bomb caused extensive casualties aboard and serious damage to &quot;Savannah,&quot; requiring emergency repairs in Malta and permanent repairs at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. After repairs and upgrades, she served in the task force that carried President Roosevelt to the Yalta Conference in early 1945.

==Construction and launch==
&quot;Savannah&quot; was laid down on 31 May 1934 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey; launched on 8 May 1937; sponsored by Miss Jayne Maye Bowden, the niece of Senator Richard B. Russell, Jr., of Georgia; and commissioned in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 10 March 1938, with Captain Robert C. Giffen in command.

==Inter-war period==
Following a shakedown cruise to Cuba and Haiti in the spring, &quot;Savannah&quot; returned to Philadelphia on 3 June for alterations followed by final trials off Rockland, Maine. This cruiser, prepared to protect American nationals should war break out in Europe, steamed out from Philadelphia bound for England on 26 September, and she reached Portsmouth on 4 October. However, the Munich agreement had postponed the war, so &quot;Savannah&quot; returned to Norfolk on 18 October. Following winter maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea, &quot;Savannah&quot; visited her namesake city, Savannah, Georgia, from 12 to 20 April 1939. She got underway from Norfolk on 26 May; transited the Panama Canal on 1 June; and arrived at San Diego on the 17th. Her homeport was soon shifted to Long Beach, California.

&quot;Savannah&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 21 May 1940, and then she conducted battle readiness and training operations in Hawaiian waters until 8 November. On 8 August Andrew C. Bennett was given command of the ship. &quot;Savannah&quot; returned to Long Beach on 14 November, and soon thereafter, she was overhauled at the Mare Island Navy Yard in San Francisco Bay. &quot;Savannah&quot; steamed back into Pearl Harbor on 27 January 1941 and remained there on the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Hawaiian Sea Frontier until 19 May, when she set course back to the Panama Canal and cruised to Boston via Cuba, arriving on 17 June 1941.

===The Neutrality Patrol===
As the flagship of Cruiser Division 8 (CruDiv 8), &quot;Savannah&quot; conducted Neutrality Patrols in waters ranging south to Cuba and back up the seaboard to the Virginia Capes. On 25 August 1941, she got underway from Norfolk to patrol in the South Atlantic as far as Trindade and Martim Vaz in the screen of the aircraft carrier . The task group then swept north from Bermuda to NS Argentia, Newfoundland, where &quot;Savannah&quot; arrived on 23 September. During the next eight weeks, the cruiser helped cover British merchantmen and Allied convoys to within a few hundred miles of the British Isles, replenishing at Casco Bay, Maine, or at New York City.

==World War II==
===North Atlantic operations===
&quot;Savannah&quot; was in New York Harbor when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. She steamed that same day toward Casco Bay, Maine, and from there she steamed via Bermuda to Brazil, arriving at Recife on 12 January 1942. She joined the screen of the aircraft carrier , in patrolling the Atlantic Ocean north of Bermuda. This island became the cruiser&#x27;s temporary base while she watched over Vichy French warships based at Martinique and Guadeloupe in the French West Indies. &quot;Savannah&quot; departed from Shelly Bay, Bermuda, on 7 June, and entered the Boston Navy Yard two days later for an overhaul. This was completed by 15 August. &quot;Savannah&quot; received a new commander, Leon S. Fiske, on 12 June. &quot;Savannah&quot; next steamed to readiness exercises in Chesapeake Bay that would prepare her for the invasion of North Africa.

===Invasion of North Africa===

&quot;Savannah&quot; became a unit of Admiral H. Kent Hewitt&#x27;s Western Naval Task Force which would land some 35,000 Army troops and 250 tanks at three different points on the Atlantic coast of French Morocco. As part of the Northern Attack Group, commanded by Rear Admiral Monroe Kelly, &quot;Savannah&quot; departed from Norfolk on 24 October 1942, and then rendezvoused with the Western Naval Task Force four days later at a point about 450 mi (720 km) south southeast of Cape Race. The Task Force, including the outer screen, covered an area approximately 20-30 mi (30–50 km), making it the greatest warship fleet to be sent out by the United States up to that time. Shortly before midnight on the night of 7 – 8 November 1942, three separate task groups closed in on three different points on the Moroccan coast to begin Operation Torch. &quot;Savannah&quot;″s Northern Attack Group was to land Brigadier General Lucian K. Truscott&#x27;s 9,099 officers and men, including 65 light tanks, on five widely separated beaches on either side of Mehedia. Their objectives were the Port Lyautey city and its all-weather airfield, the Wadi Sebou, and the Salé airfield.

On the morning of 8 November 1942, &quot;Savannah&quot; commenced firing against Vichy guns near the Kasbah, which had been firing on the Army troop&#x27;s landing boats. She also temporarily silenced a battery which had opened up on the destroyer , enabling her to avoid a disaster. By the next morning, &quot;Savannah&quot;″s guns had scored a direct hit on one of the two artillery guns in the fortress of Kasbah and had silenced the other. During that same day, &quot;Savannah&quot;″s scout planes started a new phase of warfare by successfully bombing some tank columns with their depth charges, whose fuses had been set to detonate on impact. The scout planes, maintaining about eight hours of flight time daily, struck at other shore targets, and they also kept up antisubmarine patrols. &quot;Savannah&quot;″s warplanes located an enemy battery that had been firing on the destroyer , and eliminated the battery with two well-placed depth charges. This action aided &quot;Dallas&quot; in winning the Presidential Unit Citation for safely landing a United States Army Raider Battalion on the obstacle-strewn Wadi Sebou, just off the airport near Port Lyautey.

&quot;Savannah&quot;″s scout planes again bombed and strafed enemy tanks on the Rabat Road on the morning of 10 November 1942. Throughout this day, her gunfire aided the Army&#x27;s advance. Hostilities fittingly ended on Armistice Day, 11 November. Four days later, &quot;Savannah&quot; headed for home, and she reached Norfolk on 30 November. After brief repairs following her combat missions, at New York City, &quot;Savannah&quot; steamed on 25 December to join the U.S. Navy&#x27;s South Atlantic Patrol, arriving at Recife, Brazil, on 7 January 1943. Robert W. Carey was named commander on 17 February.

===South Atlantic patrol===
&quot;Savannah&quot;″s primary mission off Brazil was the destruction of any Nazi German blockade runners spotted in the South Atlantic Ocean. Teamed with the new U.S. Navy escort carrier , plus a screen of destroyers, &quot;Savannah&quot; put to sea on 12 January 1943 on a long patrol that resulted in no combat with the enemy. &quot;Savannah&quot; went back into Recife Harbor on 15 February, and next, she steamed out again to search for blockade runners on the 21st. On 11 March 1943, she left the task group along with to investigate a ship that had been sighted by an aircraft from &quot;Santee&quot;.

&quot;Kota Tjandi&quot;, a former Dutch ship called &quot;Karin&quot; by her Kriegsmarine crew, was brought to a halt by shots fired across her bow by the two American warships. Just as a boarding party from &quot;Eberle&quot; arrived alongside, powerful time bombs, planted just before &quot;Karin&quot;″s lifeboats got underway, exploded. Eleven sailors of the boarding party were killed, but one of &quot;Savannah&quot;″s boat rescued three men from the water. &quot;Savannah&quot; took 72 German sailors on board, and quartered them below decks as prisoners-of-war. &quot;Savannah&quot; returned to New York Harbor on 28 March 1943, where she was overhauled in preparation for her next assignment in the Mediterranean Sea.

===Invasion of Sicily===

&quot;Savannah&quot; departed from Norfolk on 10 May 1943 to protect Army troop transports en route to Oran, Algeria. She arrived there on 23 May, and then began preparing for Operation Husky, the amphibious landings on the southern coast of Sicily near Gela. The cliffy coast there was topped by heavy coastal defense batteries, and no landing place could be found besides a 5,000 yd (4,600 m) stretch of shore about 1 mi (2 km) east of the mouth of the Gela River. Poised on the plateau above the beach was the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Hermann Göring Division, ready to strike back against any amphibious landing, along with other German and Italian troops.

&quot;Savannah&quot; provided naval gun fire support to the American 1st Infantry Division&#x27;s &quot;Rangers&quot; before dawn on 10 July 1943. As soon as the first light of dawn appeared, &quot;Savannah&quot; launched two scout planes. Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Bf 109s intercepted them, with fatal results. Lieutenant C. A. Anderson was killed in flight, although his radioman, Edward J. True, was able to land the riddled plane on the sea. He was picked up shortly after their airplane sank into the sea. Three of the &quot;Savannah&quot;″s four scout planes were shot down on that day.

On the morning of 11 July 1943, &quot;Savannah&quot; was the first warship to respond to a call for naval gunfire at two points on a road leading into Gela. She knocked out several tanks before shifting her fire to the Butera road to aid advancing American infantry soldiers. Soon friend and foe became so enmeshed in the battle, that her naval gunfire could no longer intervene. &quot;Savannah&quot; destroyed more tanks later in the afternoon, however, and next she finished out the remaining hours of daylight by helping the Army Rangers in repelling an Italian infantry attack. The next morning, &quot;Savannah&quot; supported the Army troops with more than 500 rounds of six-inch shells as they advanced toward Butera. That day, &quot;Savannah&quot;″s doctors and hospital corpsmen also gave medical care to 41 wounded infantrymen, while the warship bombarded enemy troop concentrations far inland, and also shelled their artillery batteries high in the hills.

On 13 July 1943, &quot;Savannah&quot; had but one call for naval gunfire support. She answered by hurling several salvos on the hill town of Butera. Before the 1st Infantry Division pressed on into the interior, it thanked &quot;Savannah&quot; for crushing three infantry attacks and silencing four artillery batteries, as well as for demoralizing the Italian troops by the effect of her fire. On the next day, &quot;Savannah&quot; steamed towards Algiers. &quot;Savannah&quot; returned to Sicily on 19 July 1943 to support the American 7th Army&#x27;s drive along the eastern and northern coasts of Sicily. On 30 July, carrying the pennant of Rear Admiral Lyal A. Davidson, &quot;Savannah&quot; arrived at Palermo Harbor on the north coast of Sicily to provide daily fire support. Her guns helped to repel enemy aircraft raiding the harbor from 1–4 August. On 8 August, her task force supported the landing of the 30th Regimental Combat Team, including army artillery and tanks, on a beach nine miles east of Monte Fratello.

===Invasion of Salerno===


&quot;Savannah&quot; returned to Algiers on 10 August 1943 in order to train with U.S. Army troops for the Operation Avalanche amphibious landings to be made at Salerno, Italy. Leaving Mers-el-Kebir Harbor, Algeria, on 5 September, her Southern Attack Force entered Salerno Bay a few hours before midnight of the 8th. &quot;Savannah&quot; was the first American ship to open fire against the German shore defenses in Salerno Bay. She silenced a railroad artillery battery with 57 rounds, forced the retirement of enemy tanks, and completed eight more fire support missions that day. She continued her support until the morning of 11 September 1943, when she was put out of action. A radio-controlled Fritz X PGM gravity bomb had been released at a safe distance by a high-flying German warplane and it exploded 49 ft (15 m) distance from . &quot;Savannah&quot; increased her speed to 20 kn (23 mph, 37 km/h) as a KG 100 Dornier Do 217 K-2 bomber approached from out of the sun. USAAF P-38 Lightnings and &quot;Savannah&quot;″s anti-aircraft gunners, tracking this warplane at 18,700 ft (5,700 m), failed to stop the Fritz X bomb, trailing a stream of smoke. The bomb pierced the armored turret roof of &quot;Savannah&quot;″s No. 3 gun turret, passed through three decks into the lower ammunition-handling room, where it exploded, blowing a hole in her keel and tearing a seam in the cruiser&#x27;s port side. For at least 30 minutes, secondary explosions in the turret and its ammunition supply rooms hampered firefighting efforts.

&quot;Savannah&quot;″s crew quickly sealed off flooded and burned compartments, and corrected her list. With assistance from the salvage tugs and , &quot;Savannah&quot; got underway under her own steam by 17:57 and steamed for Malta. &quot;Savannah&quot; lost 206 crewmen in this attack. Thirteen other sailors were seriously wounded, and four more were trapped in a watertight compartment for 60 hours. These four sailors were not rescued until &quot;Savannah&quot; had already arrived at Grand Harbor, Valletta, Malta, on 12 September. After emergency repairs were completed, &quot;Savannah&quot; departed Malta on 7 December 1943, bound for the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard by way of Tunis, Algiers, and Bermuda. She arrived at the Naval Yard on 23 December and underwent heavy repair work for the next eight months. During this period her forward superstructure was remodeled, four dual mount 5&quot;/38 caliber turrets replaced her eight single open-mount five-inch naval guns and a new set of up-to-date 20 mm and 40 mm antiaircraft guns were installed. In addition to the new gunnery fit she also received new air-search and surface-search gunnery radars. After this refit she more resembled her half sister , than her &quot;Brooklyn&quot;-class sister ships.

===Later wartime activities===

&quot;Savannah&quot;″s Navy Yard repairs of combat damage, and the upgrading of her weapons, were completed on 4 September 1944. Nonetheless, she was never sent to a combat zone for the remainder of the war. She steamed out of Philadelphia Harbor on the next day, and reported to the Commander, Fleet Operational Training Command on 10 September for a shakedown cruise and sailor&#x27;s refresher training. She returned to Norfolk on 12 October 1944 for readiness training with CruDiv 8. &quot;Savannah&quot; sailed on 21 January 1945 to rendezvous with the heavy cruiser , which was carrying President Roosevelt to the Mediterranean Sea, &quot;en route&quot; to Yalta, Crimea, in the Soviet Union for a conference with Prime Minister Winston Churchill and the Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin.

&quot;Savannah&quot; entered Grand Harbor, Valletta, Malta, on 2 February 1945. At that island, the President and his party disembarked and traveled to Yalta by airplane. A memorial service was held at the graves of &quot;Savannah&quot;″s sailors and marines killed in her bombing off Salerno. &quot;Savannah&quot; departed from Malta on 9 February 1945 and steamed to Alexandria, Egypt, to await the President&#x27;s 12 February return to &quot;Quincy&quot;. The Presidential convoy departed Alexandria on 15 February and arrived at Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 27 February. &quot;Savannah&quot; was underway on 28 February 1945 and steamed towards a new homeport, Newport, Rhode Island, on 8 March. Until 24 May 1945, &quot;Savannah&quot; was used as a school ship for the nucleus of crews of warships that had not yet been commissioned.

==Post-war==
After a visit to New York and installation of radar-guided fire control equipment for her 40 mm anti-aircraft guns, &quot;Savannah&quot; became the flagship of a midshipmen&#x27;s training squadron under Rear Admiral Frank E. Beatty. &quot;Savannah&quot; departed from Annapolis on 7 June 1945 for training at sea with over 400 midshipmen aboard. After two such cruises to Cuba and back, &quot;Savannah&quot; disembarked the midshipmen at Annapolis on 30 September, took on others, and steamed on 1 October towards Pensacola, Florida. She spent the Navy Day celebrations from 25 to 30 October 1945 in her namesake city of Savannah. She then returned to Norfolk on 1 November to prepare for service in the huge Operation Magic Carpet naval fleet which was returning hundreds of thousands of overseas war veterans home to the United States. &quot;Savannah&quot; departed from Norfolk on 13 November 1945, and she reached Le Havre, France, on 20 November. The following day, she put to sea with 1,370 enlisted men and 67 officer passengers, bringing them to New York Harbor on 28 November. She completed another similar voyage on 17 December. &quot;Savannah&quot;″s home base was shifted to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 19 December 1945 for her deactivation overhaul. She was placed in commission in reserve on 22 April 1946, and was finally decommissioned on 3 February 1947. One of two &quot;Brooklyn&quot;-class cruisers modernized with bulges, twin 5in/38 guns and Mark 37 directors, she was retained by the USN when most of her surviving sister ships were sold to South American navies. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959, and she was sold for scrapping on 6 January 1960 to the Bethlehem Steel Company.

==In literature and popular culture==
&quot;The Battle of Sicily: How the Allies Lost Their Chance for Total Victory&quot; (Mitcham &amp; von Stauffenberg; 1991) described &quot;Savannah&quot; in the 11 July 1943 Amphibious Battle of Gela, Sicily, as having fired 500 rounds from its fifteen six-inch guns onto the Italian Livorno Division, and was said to have broken the back of the Italian attack against U.S. Army Rangers who then took 400 Italian prisoners; &quot;Rangers Lead the Way&quot; (Taylor, 1996) characterized &quot;Savannah&quot; as &quot;the Rangers&#x27; favorite cruiser&quot; for this action. Taylor also credited &quot;Savannah&quot; with firing on German forces from twelve miles away to enable U.S. forces to seize the first high ground overlooking Gela.

In the 1980 movie &quot;The Big Red One,&quot; Lee Marvin&#x27;s character Sergeant Possum praised &quot;Savannah&quot; for firing on enemy artillery from miles offshore, as the Hermann Göring Panzer division approached Possum&#x27;s position in a cave with their backs to the sea, Possum exclaiming that &quot;the U.S. Navy saved our ass.&quot;

==Memorial and tributes==
In Savannah, the Propeller Club of the United States has a memorial fountain to five ships named &quot;Savannah&quot;. The rightmost plaque on the fountain&#x27;s north wall is for &quot;Savannah&quot; (CL-42).

In late 2013 the Ships of the Sea Maritime Museum in Savannah, presented an exhibit to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of &quot;Savannah&#x27;s&quot; participation in the Salerno landing. The museum subsequently maintained an online tribute, &quot;Battle Voices – Salerno, Italy 1943,&quot; that included photographs, a newsreel, the ship&#x27;s Muster Roll, and quotations from crew members, war correspondents, and &quot;Savannah&#x27;s&quot; General Quarters Narrative. The &quot;Savannah Morning News&quot; reported in 2013 that &quot;Savannah&quot; had its 35th and possibly final reunion in 2006, a gathering attended by about two dozen crewmen.

In late 2018, on the 75th anniversary of the Salerno landing, the Ships of the Sea Maritime Museum in Savannah provided a commemoration display titled &quot;An Irregular Morning&quot;, including newsreel cuts and surviving artifacts.

<text>The  ( ; , ), &quot;The Pourtraicture of His Sacred Majestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings&quot;, is a purported spiritual autobiography attributed to King Charles I of England. It was published on 9 February 1649, ten days after the King was beheaded by Parliament in the aftermath of the English Civil War in 1649.

== Contents and authorship ==

Written in a simple, moving and straightforward style in the form of a diary, the book combines irenic prayers urging the forgiveness of Charles&#x27;s executioners with a justification of royalism and the King&#x27;s political and military programme that led to the Civil War.

It is by no means certain that Charles wrote the book. After the Restoration, John Gauden, bishop of Worcester, claimed to have written it. Scholars continue to disagree about the merits of this claim, though assuming that if Gauden wrote it, he had access to Charles&#x27;s papers when he did so. Jeremy Taylor is also said to have had a hand in its revision, and to be the source of its title; an earlier draft bore the name , .

Some later editions of the contained a sworn statement by William Levett, Esq., longtime courtier and groom of the bedchamber to the King, that Levett had witnessed Charles writing the text during the time that Levett accompanied him in his imprisonment on the Isle of Wight. A witness to the King&#x27;s execution, Levett later helped transport the King&#x27;s body back to Windsor Castle for burial.

Whoever wrote the , its author was an effective prose stylist, one who had partaken deeply of the solemn yet simple eloquence of Anglican piety as expressed in Cranmer&#x27;s &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. The end result is an image of a steadfast monarch who, while admitting his weaknesses, declares the truth of his religious principles and the purity of his political motives, while trusting in God despite adversity. Charles&#x27;s chief weakness, it says, was in yielding to Parliament&#x27;s demands for the head of the Earl of Strafford; for this sin, Charles paid with his throne and his life. Its portrait of Charles as a martyr invited comparison of the King to Jesus.

The pathos of this dramatic presentation made it a master stroke of Royalist propaganda. The book was extremely popular despite official disapproval during the Protectorate and the Restoration; it went into 36 editions in 1649 alone. In 1657 it even appeared in musical form, with a verse rendering by Thomas Stanley and music by John Wilson. The musical setting blended the austere style of the metrical psalter, favoured by the Puritans, with fashionable (and Catholic) instrumental accompaniment provided by an organ, theorbo or another such continuo instrument. Because of the favourable impression the book made of the King, Parliament commissioned John Milton to write a riposte to it, which he published under the title () in 1649. Milton&#x27;s response sought to portray the image of Charles, and the absolute monarchy he aspired to, as idols, claiming a reverence due only to God, and therefore justly overthrown to preserve the law of God. This theological counterattack failed to dislodge the sentimental narrative of the itself from public esteem.

A satire on the work, (), was also published in 1649.

== Frontispiece ==

The frontispiece was engraved by William Marshall. Seven versions are known to exist, with minor variations (for example, the angle of the King&#x27;s head, and thus whether or not his left eye is visible).

The heavily allegorical frontispiece of the depicts the King as a Christian martyr. The Latin texts read:
* — (scroll around the rock);
* — (beam from the clouds);
* — (scroll around the tree);
* — (around the heavenly crown marked ; meant to be contrasted with:
** — (around the Crown of England, removed from the King&#x27;s head and lying on the ground), with the motto ; and 
** — , the martyr&#x27;s crown of thorns held by Charles; contains the motto ;
* — ;
* — or ;

In the first edition, the frontispiece was accompanied by Latin and English verses that explain it. The English verses go:

&lt;poem&gt;Though clogg&#x27;d with weights of miseries
Palm-like Depress&#x27;d, I higher rise.

And as th&#x27;unmoved Rock out-brave&#x27;s
The boist&#x27;rous Windes and rageing waves
So triumph I. And shine more bright
In sad Affliction&#x27;s darksom night.

That Splendid, but yet toilsom Crown
Regardlessly I trample down.

With joie I take this Crown of thorn,
Though sharp, yet easy to be born.

That heavn&#x27;nly Crown, already mine,
I view with eies of Faith divine.

I slight vain things: and do embrace
Glorie, the just reward of Grace.&lt;/poem&gt;

==King Charles venerated by the Church of England==
The and its portrait of Charles&#x27;s execution as a martyrdom were so successful that, at the Restoration, a special commemoration of the King on 30 January was added to the Book of Common Prayer, directing that the day be observed as an occasion for fasting and repentance. On 19 May 1660, the Convocation of Canterbury and York canonised King Charles at the urging of Charles II, and added his name to the prayer book. Charles I is the only saint formally canonised by the Church of England.

The commemoration was removed from the prayer book by Queen Victoria in 1859. Several Anglican churches and chapels are dedicated to &quot;King Charles the Martyr&quot;. The Society of King Charles the Martyr was established in 1894 to work for the restoration of the King&#x27;s name to the Calendar and to encourage the veneration of the Royal Martyr.

==Representation of Charles as martyr in the text==
Richard Helgerson suggests that represents the culmination of the representational strategies of Charles&#x27; immediate Tudor and Stuart predecessors: the textual absolutism of King James and the &quot;iconic performativity&quot; of Elizabeth. In addition to the way it recapitulates previous modes of royal representation, Helgerson notes a certain affinity between the textual aesthetics of the &quot;King&#x27;s Book&quot; and those of the Counter-Reformation: &quot; drew on a set of culturally conditioned responses against which the new culture of print was defining itself, responses that had previously served Elizabeth and Shakespeare and that even then were serving Counter-Reformation Catholicism. This unbookish—indeed anti-bookish—book thus turned print against itself&quot;. In Helgerson&#x27;s view, draws upon devotional impulses that both precede and supersede the dominance of the print-obsessed Protestant scripturalism ascendant at the moment of Charles&#x27; execution.

<text>Beheaded is a Maltese death metal band. They were formed in 1991 by guitarist David Bugeja, and drummer Chris Brincat. They have performed in Malta, Europe, and the US, and have released several albums.

==Biography==
===Formation and demo (1991 – 1995)===
The band was founded in 1991 by drummer Chris Brincat and guitarist David Bugeja, becoming the first death metal band in Malta after Biblical Infamy (which also had David Cachia on Bass in its ranks). In the largely Catholic country, the band has claimed that it has encountered a lot of confrontation and negativity, also mentioning this in some interviews as being a major setback of the country. A demo tape called ‘Souldead’ was released in 1995, making it the first death metal studio recording released by a Maltese band, putting the country on the extreme music map. Souldead was made to circulate strongly in the fanzine and tape trading circuits of the era.

===Record deal, debut album, and first tour (1996 - 1999)===
1996 saw the band signing its first record deal with Sweden&#x27;s X-Treme Records. The first album entitled &quot;Perpetual Mockery&quot;, was recorded at Temple Studios in June 1996. Unforeseen hindrances determined that the CD saw its release in early 1998. Even so, the release was again praised in many reviews including a 4K/5K review in &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, and 7/10 review in &quot;Terrorizer&quot;. Summer 1998 also saw the band embark for the first time outside Maltese shores to play shows in Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Germany. During this tour the band played opening shows for Vader, Dying Fetus, Defaced Creation and Deranged, as well as gigs with Fleshless. New material started to outline a more brutal and heavy approach in the songs.

===&quot;Resurgence of Oblivion&quot; (1999 – 2001)===
A five-track promo disc was recorded in 1999, which captured the attention of several record labels. However, the band opted to sign with Danish label Mighty Music. The same five tracks were released as the &quot;Resurgence of Oblivion&quot; MCD. In 2001, Beheaded composed all the songs for the upcoming &quot;Recounts of Disembodiment&quot; between January and May 2001. The recording took place once again at Temple Studios in June 2001 with sound engineer David Vella behind the mixing desk. ‘The European Extermination Tour’ took place throughout Europe in July 2001 which saw Beheaded headline alongside label mates Anasarca, stopping by at the Obscene Extreme Festival in the Czech Republic. 2001 was the year when Chris got endorsed by Paiste for his abilities on the drumkit.

===Mighty Music and &quot;Recounts of Disembodiment&quot; (2002 – 2003)===
Early 2002 saw the release of &quot;Recounts of Disembodiment&quot; on Denmark&#x27;s Mighty Music, an album which went down well with the followers of this extreme form of music. Positive reviews cropped up, and many interviews were done in numerous publications, including a 9/10 review in &quot;Terrorizer&quot; Mighty Music also licensed the &quot;Resurgence of Oblivion&quot; MCD, and &quot;Recounts of Disembodiment&quot; CD to the US label, Forever Underground Records. April and May 2002 was the time when the first US tour took place. The tour included over 20 shows and boasted appearances at the Ohio Deathfest and New Jersey Metal Meltdown 4. Back in Europe, Beheaded took part in the Fuck the Commerce V festival in Germany.

===Unique Leader and &quot;Ominous Bloodline&quot; (2004 – 2008)===
2004 saw the band hit the European roads again on the ‘Beheaded Europe with Prejudice Tour’ along Belgian death metal band, Prejudice. Beheaded inked a new record deal with US label Unique Leader Records in April 2004. The &quot;Ominous Bloodline&quot; album was recorded in July and August 2004, at Temple Studios, Malta and Mastered at Imperial Mastering in the US. The album was officially launched on March 8, 2005. It marked a significant step forward for Beheaded, landing them spots in some of the major death metal festivals in Europe, including the NRW Deathfest and the Death Feast Open Air, both in Germany and Brutal Assault in the Czech Republic in 2008.

===New lineup and &quot;Never to Dawn&quot; (2009 - present)===
After various line-up changes, by the end of 2009 guitarist Omar Grech returned on guitars after a break from the band. In the same period of time, a new frontman, Frank Calleja, vocalist with Maltese band Slit, joined the band as the fourth permanent vocalist. In December 2009, the band performed live after a period of a year and a half. This was the first time that the band performed live as a quartet.

In 2010, Robert Agius, formerly known as Lord Trebor with Archaean Harmony, joined in as the second guitarist on this new line-up and performed live with the band in March 2010, in preparation for their performance at the Neurotic Deathfest that same year.

The band entered Temple Studios in Mistra Bay, Malta, on 29 October 2010 to record the fourth album called &quot;Never To Dawn&quot;, which was released under Unique Leader Records on November 6, 2012.

In January 2014, the band announced that founding member and long time drummer, Chris Brincat has left the band.

<doc id="614227" wikidata="Q271920" url="?curid=614227" title="Lydia Lopokova">
<text>Lydia Lopokova, Baroness Keynes (born Lidiya Vasilyevna Lopukhova, ; 21 October 1891 – 8 June 1981) was a Russian ballerina famous during the early 20th century.

Lopokova trained at the Imperial Ballet School. She toured with the Ballets Russes in 1910, and rejoined them in 1916 after an interlude in the United States.

Lopokova married the English economist John Maynard Keynes in 1925 and was also known as the Lady Keynes. She largely disappeared from public view after Keynes&#x27;s death in 1946 and spent her remaining years in Sussex.

==Early life==
Lopokova was born in Saint Petersburg. Her father worked as the chief usher at the Alexandrinsky Theatre; her mother was descended from a Scottish engineer. Four of the Lopukhov children became ballet dancers; one of them, Fyodor Lopukhov, was a chief choreographer for the Mariinsky Theatre from 1922 to 1935 and again from 1951 to 1956.

Lydia trained at the Imperial Ballet School, where she almost immediately became a star pupil. As a child she danced before the Emperor and his family, in productions such as the &quot;Fairy Doll&quot; and &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;; she also witnessed the events of Bloody Sunday at first hand. As she grew older &quot;she responded instinctively to the expressive choreography of Mikhail Fokine, his rebellion against the stiff academicism of the classical style, and her chance came when she was chosen to join the Ballets Russes... on their European tour in 1910... Diaghilev knocked a year off her age and promoted her as a child star.&quot; She stayed with the Ballets Russes only briefly, knowing that she had little future in Russia (&quot;she was the wrong size and shape for the grand roles and there were already plenty of prima ballerinas in St. Petersburg&quot;).

==America and Europe==

She accepted an American offer of 18,000 francs per month, sixty times more than she had earned in Russia, and after the summer tour left for the United States, where she remained for five years, enjoying tremendous success and legally changing her name to Lopokova in April 1914.

In 1915, while in New York, she had become engaged to the &quot;New York Morning Telegraph&quot; sportswriter Heywood Broun, later a member of the celebrated Algonquin Round Table coterie. When the Ballets Russes came to the United States in 1916 she broke off her engagement, and soon after married the company&#x27;s Italian business manager, Randolfo Barrocchi. She danced regularly with the company, including with her former partner, Vaslav Nijinsky.

She toured with the Ballets Russes in America, Europe, South America and later in London. She first came to the attention of Londoners in &quot;The Good-humoured Ladies&quot; in 1918, and followed this with a raucous performance with Léonide Massine in the Can-Can of &quot;La Boutique fantasque&quot;. When her marriage to Barrocchi broke down in 1919, the dancer abruptly disappeared for a time, as she had done before in America. She also had an on-off affair with Igor Stravinsky, who composed for the Ballets Russes.

==Relationship with Keynes==

In 1921, Diaghilev staged a lavish production of &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; in which Lopokova danced the Lilac Fairy and Princess Aurora. The production was a flop, but it brought her to the attention of John Maynard Keynes. He &quot;sat every night in the stalls, enchanted by Lydia as the Lilac Fairy casting spells over the cradle.&quot; The two soon became lovers, and they were married in 1925, once her divorce from Barrocchi had been obtained. Until now, Keynes&#x27;s closest relationships had been with the members of the Bloomsbury group, especially Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, who had been the great love of his life. They and other members of the group, such as Virginia Woolf and Lytton Strachey, found Lydia difficult to accept and were resistant to her partnership with Keynes for many years even after their marriage took place. (Some of them later regretted their snobbery; E.M. Forster, for example, wrote: &quot;How we all used to underestimate her.&quot;) However, she maintained friendships with many other members of London&#x27;s cultural elite of the time, including T. S. Eliot and H. G. Wells. During these years she became a friend of Pablo Picasso, who drew her many times. Lopokova and Keynes hoped to have children, but this did not happen.

The couple spent their honeymoon in Sussex in 1925. A fortnight into the honeymoon they were briefly visited by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. Lydia remarked to Wittgenstein &quot;What a beautiful tree&quot;, Wittgenstein responded glaringly asking &quot;what do you mean?&quot; which caused Lydia to burst into tears.

==Later life==
Besides being involved in the early days of English ballet, Lopokova appeared on the stage in London and Cambridge from 1928, and was broadcast on the BBC as a presenter and in a number of acting roles; she read &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; over the BBC in 1935 (and a few years later reprised it for BBC television). Lopokova is represented as Terpsichore, the muse of dancing, in &quot;The Awakening of the Muses&quot;, a mosaic at the National Gallery, London, laid by Boris Anrep in 1933. Also in 1933 she danced her last ballet role, as Swanhilda in &quot;Coppélia,&quot; for the new Vic-Wells Ballet.

She lived with Keynes in London, Cambridge, and Sussex. &quot;Lopokova was [Keynes&#x27;s] partner in founding the Cambridge Arts Theatre, and in advising him on the constitution for the Arts Council; with his financial input she became a moving spirit in the Camargo Society, which led to the creation of a national ballet company.&quot; After her husband&#x27;s collapse from an attack of angina in 1937, Lopokova devoted herself increasingly to taking care of his health. She supervised his diet and made sure he had enough rest; &quot;without her constant attention and her joie de vivre, Keynes might not have made it to Bretton Woods.&quot;

==Death==
After Keynes&#x27;s death in 1946, she largely disappeared from public view and lived in Tilton House, Sussex for her remaining years. Richard Shone published a reminiscence of several visits to her there. Lopokova died in the Three Ways Nursing Home in Seaford in 1981, at 89.

== Cultural representations ==
Virginia Woolf based the character of Rezia in &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; in part on Lydia.

Lynn Seymour played Lydia in the 1993 film &quot;Wittgenstein&quot;, directed by Derek Jarman.

&quot;Wooing in Absence&quot; was performed by Natalia Makarova and Benjamin Whitrow, and directed by Patrick Garland, at Charleston Farmhouse and Tate Britain

The novel &quot;Mr Keynes&#x27; Revolution&quot; (2020) by E. J. Barnes is about Keynes&#x27; and Lopokova&#x27;s lives in the 1920s.

Lopokova is the central character in &#x27;Firebird&#x27;, the novel by Susan Sellers, which recounts Lydia&#x27;s love affair with Keynes, her prickly reception from his friends in the Bloomsbury group, and their marriage, as well as narrating the story of Lydia&#x27;s earlier life, from her childhood in the Imperial Ballet School through to her tours in America and beyond as a solo artist and celebrity.
&quot;Love Letters&quot; was performed with Helena Bonham Carter as Lopokova and Tobias Menzies as Keynes in July 2021 at Charleston Farmhouse, with a script crafted by reader-in-residence Holly Dawson..

==Biographies==
Maynard Keynes&#x27;s nephew Milo Keynes wrote a biography, &quot;Lydia Lopokova&quot; (St. Martin&#x27;s Press, 1983, ). Judith Mackrell published her biography, &quot;Bloomsbury Ballerina: Lydia Lopokova, Imperial Dancer and Mrs John Maynard Keynes&quot;, in 2008. (Weidenfeld, 2008, ).

<text>The second USS &quot;Mercy&quot; (AH-8) was a laid down under Maritime Commission contract by Consolidated Steel Corporation at the Wilmington Yard, Wilmington, California, on 4 February 1943. She was acquired by the US Navy from the Maritime Commission on 25 March 1943 and launched the same day, sponsored by Lieutenant (junior grade) Doris M. Yetter, NC, USN, who had been a prisoner of war on Guam in 1941. She was converted from a cargo ship to a hospital ship by Los Angeles Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Company, San Pedro, California and commissioned 7 August 1944.

==Service history==
&quot;Mercy&quot; was one of three hospital ships, the others being and , built, commanded and crewed by the Navy for the Army. These ships, unlike the Navy hospital ships, were intended for evacuation and transport of patients after primary care had been given. Medical equipment and personnel were provided by the Army. The Army medical complement table of organization provided for the temporary reinforcement of the staff if the ship directly supported amphibious operations.

===Philippines===
After shakedown beginning 17 August, &quot;Mercy&quot;, staffed by the US Army&#x27;s 214th Hospital Ship personnel, was assigned to NTS to operate with the 5th and 7th Fleets. She departed San Pedro 31 August for the South Pacific and, after calls at Pearl Harbor and Eniwetok, arrived Hollandia, New Guinea, 14 October. Five days later the hospital ship departed for the Philippines for the initial landing at Leyte on 20 October, arriving off Leyte Gulf the morning of 25 October to find the Battle for Leyte Gulf still raging for another day.

&quot;Mercy&quot; moved to San Pedro Bay later the same day and began embarking some 400 casualties, mostly from LSTs alongside. On 26 October she sailed for the Admiralties, via Kossol Roads, Palau, Caroline Islands, arriving at Manus to disembark the wounded for transfer to base hospitals. During the next five months, &quot;Mercy&quot; completed seven more voyages from Leyte to Manus, or Hollandia. She also transported the 3rd Field Hospital from New Guinea to Tacloban, Philippines, early in January 1945.

===Okinawa===
On 19 March &quot;Mercy&quot; reported to the 5th Fleet at Ulithi, Caroline Islands, for service during the Okinawa campaign, beginning with the landings 1 April. She arrived off Okinawa the morning of 19 April in company with to remain for four days at Hagushi Beach embarking patients despite frequent air raids and threat of kamikazes. The hospital ship then got underway for Saipan, Marianas Islands, 23 April. She made two more voyages to Okinąwa, returning from the latter to Saipan 24 May.

&quot;Mercy&quot; next carried wounded from Leyte and Manila on two voyages to Biak, returning to Manila on 23 June for two months&#x27; duty as station hospital ship. On 19 August she embarked the 227th Station Hospital assigned to the Korean Occupation Forces, and three days later departed for Korea via Okinawa, arriving Jinsen 9 September.

On 19 October the hospital ship departed for Manila and San Pedro, California, arriving 14 November. She got underway for the central Pacific 4 February 1946, arriving Pearl Harbor on 12 February for duty until 2 April when she returned to California.

&quot;Mercy&quot; decommissioned at San Francisco, California, 17 May, was delivered to the War Department the same day, and transferred to the US Army 20 June for further service as a hospital ship. On 25 September 1946, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register.

&quot;Mercy&quot; received two battle stars for her World War II service.

===Post-war===
She was decommissioned in 1946 and placed in reserve. In 1956, she was sold to the State University of New York Maritime College as the training ship, &quot;Empire State III.&quot; She served in this role until being replaced in 1959. She was later scrapped in 1970.

<doc id="614230" wikidata="Q14026181" url="?curid=614230" title="Event-related potential">
<text>An event-related potential (ERP) is the measured brain response that is the direct result of a specific sensory, cognitive, or motor event. More formally, it is any stereotyped electrophysiological response to a stimulus. The study of the brain in this way provides a noninvasive means of evaluating brain functioning.

ERPs are measured by means of electroencephalography (EEG). The magnetoencephalography (MEG) equivalent of ERP is the ERF, or event-related field. Evoked potentials and induced potentials are subtypes of ERPs.

==History==

With the discovery of the electroencephalogram (EEG) in 1924, Hans Berger revealed that one could measure the electrical activity of the human brain by placing electrodes on the scalp and amplifying the signal. Changes in voltage can then be plotted over a period of time. He observed that the voltages could be influenced by external events that stimulated the senses. The EEG proved to be a useful source in recording brain activity over the ensuing decades. However, it tended to be very difficult to assess the highly specific neural process that are the focus of cognitive neuroscience because using pure EEG data made it difficult to isolate individual neurocognitive processes. Event-related potentials (ERPs) offered a more sophisticated method of extracting more specific sensory, cognitive, and motor events by using simple averaging techniques.
In 1935–1936, Pauline and Hallowell Davis recorded the first known ERPs on awake humans and their findings were published a few years later, in 1939. Due to World War II not much research was conducted in the 1940s, but research focusing on sensory issues picked back up again in the 1950s. In 1964, research by Grey Walter and colleagues began the modern era of ERP component discoveries when they reported the first cognitive ERP component, called the contingent negative variation (CNV). Sutton, Braren, and Zubin (1965) made another advancement with the discovery of the P3 component. Over the next fifteen years, ERP component research became increasingly popular. The 1980s, with the introduction of inexpensive computers, opened up a new door for cognitive neuroscience research. Currently, ERP is one of the most widely used methods in cognitive neuroscience research to study the physiological correlates of sensory, perceptual and cognitive activity associated with processing information.

==Calculation==

ERPs can be reliably measured using electroencephalography (EEG), a procedure that measures electrical activity of the brain over time using electrodes placed on the scalp. The EEG reflects thousands of simultaneously ongoing brain processes. This means that the brain response to a single stimulus or event of interest is not usually visible in the EEG recording of a single trial. To see the brain&#x27;s response to a stimulus, the experimenter must conduct many trials and average the results together, causing random brain activity to be averaged out and the relevant waveform to remain, called the ERP.

The random (background) brain activity together with other bio-signals (e.g., EOG, EMG, EKG) and electromagnetic interference (e.g., line noise, fluorescent lamps) constitute the noise contribution to the recorded ERP. This noise obscures the signal of interest, which is the sequence of underlying ERPs under study.
From an engineering point of view it is possible to define the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the recorded ERPs. Averaging increases the SNR of the recorded ERPs making them discernible and allowing for their interpretation. This has a simple mathematical explanation provided that some simplifying assumptions are made. These assumptions are:
# The signal of interest is made of a sequence of event-locked ERPs with invariable latency and shape
# The noise can be approximated by a zero-mean Gaussian random process of variance formula_1 which is uncorrelated between trials and not time-locked to the event (this assumption can be easily violated, for example in the case of a subject doing little tongue movements while mentally counting the targets in an experiment).
Having defined formula_2, the trial number, and formula_3, the time elapsed after the formula_2th event, each recorded trial can be written as formula_5 where formula_6 is the signal and formula_7 is the noise (Under the assumptions above, the signal does not depend on the specific trial while the noise does).

The average of formula_8 trials is
:formula_9 .

The expected value of formula_10 is (as hoped) the signal itself, formula_11.

Its variance is
:formula_12.
For this reason the noise amplitude of the average of formula_8 trials is expected to deviate from the mean (which is formula_6) by less or equal than formula_15 in 68% of the cases. In particular, the deviation wherein 68% of the noise amplitudes lie is formula_16 times that of a single trial. A larger deviation of formula_17 can already be expected to encompass 95% of all noise amplitudes.

Wide amplitude noise (such as eye blinks or movement artifacts) are often several orders of magnitude larger than the underlying ERPs. Therefore, trials containing such artifacts should be removed before averaging. Artifact rejection can be performed manually by visual inspection or using an automated procedure based on predefined fixed thresholds (limiting the maximum EEG amplitude or slope) or on time-varying thresholds derived from the statistics of the set of trials.

== Nomenclature ==

ERP waveforms consist of a series of positive and negative voltage deflections, which are related to a set of underlying components. Though some ERP components are referred to with acronyms (e.g., contingent negative variation – CNV, error-related negativity – ERN), most components are referred to by a letter (N/P) indicating polarity (negative/positive), followed by a number indicating either the latency in milliseconds or the component&#x27;s ordinal position in the waveform. For instance, a negative-going peak that is the first substantial peak in the waveform and often occurs about 100 milliseconds after a stimulus is presented is often called the N100 (indicating its latency is 100 ms after the stimulus and that it is negative) or N1 (indicating that it is the first peak and is negative); it is often followed by a positive peak, usually called the P200 or P2. The stated latencies for ERP components are often quite variable, particularly so for the later components that are related to the cognitive processing of the stimulus. For example, the P300 component may exhibit a peak anywhere between 250 ms – 700 ms.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

===Relative to behavioral measures===
Compared with behavioral procedures, ERPs provide a continuous measure of processing between a stimulus and a response, making it possible to determine which stage(s) are being affected by a specific experimental manipulation. Another advantage over behavioral measures is that they can provide a measure of processing of stimuli even when there is no behavioral change. However, because of the significantly small size of an ERP, it usually takes a large number of trials to accurately measure it correctly.

===Relative to other neurophysiological measures===

====Invasiveness====
Unlike microelectrodes, which require an electrode to be inserted into the brain, and PET scans that expose humans to radiation, ERPs use EEG, a non-invasive procedure.

====Spatial and temporal resolution====

ERPs provide excellent temporal resolution—as the speed of ERP recording is only constrained by the sampling rate that the recording equipment can feasibly support, whereas hemodynamic measures (such as fMRI, PET, and fNIRS) are inherently limited by the slow speed of the BOLD response. The spatial resolution of an ERP, however, is much poorer than that of hemodynamic methods—in fact, the location of ERP sources is an inverse problem that cannot be exactly solved, only estimated. Thus, ERPs are well suited to research questions about the speed of neural activity, and are less well suited to research questions about the location of such activity.

===Cost===

ERP research is much cheaper to do than other imaging techniques such as fMRI, PET, and MEG. This is because purchasing and maintaining an EEG system is less expensive than the other systems.

== Clinical ==
Physicians and neurologists will sometimes use a flashing visual checkerboard stimulus to test for any damage or trauma in the visual system. In a healthy person, this stimulus will elicit a strong response over the primary visual cortex located in the occipital lobe, in the back of the brain.

ERP component abnormalities in clinical research have been shown in neurological conditions such as:
* AD/HD
* Dementia
* Parkinson&#x27;s disease
* Multiple sclerosis
* Head injuries
* Stroke
* Obsessive-compulsive disorder
* Schizophrenia
* Depression
* Autism spectrum disorder
* Epilepsy – to monitor the efficiency of cognitive processes

== Research ==
ERPs are used extensively in neuroscience, cognitive psychology, cognitive science, and psycho-physiological research. Experimental psychologists and neuroscientists have discovered many different stimuli that elicit reliable ERPs from participants. The timing of these responses is thought to provide a measure of the timing of the brain&#x27;s communication or timing of information processing. For example, in the checkerboard paradigm described above, healthy participants&#x27; first response of the visual cortex is around 50–70 ms. This would seem to indicate that this is the amount of time it takes for the transduced visual stimulus to reach the cortex after light first enters the eye. Alternatively, the P300 response occurs at around 300ms in the oddball paradigm, for example, regardless of the type of stimulus presented: visual, tactile, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, etc. Because of this general invariance with regard to stimulus type, the P300 component is understood to reflect a higher cognitive response to unexpected and/or cognitively salient stimuli. The P300 response has also been studied in the context of information and memory detection. In addition, there are studies on abnormalities of P300 in depression. Depressed patients tend to have a reduced P200 and P300 amplitude and a prolonged P300 latency.

Due to the consistency of the P300 response to novel stimuli, a brain–computer interface can be constructed which relies on it. By arranging many signals in a grid, randomly flashing the rows of the grid as in the previous paradigm, and observing the P300 responses of a subject staring at the grid, the subject may communicate which stimulus he is looking at, and thus slowly &quot;type&quot; words.

Another area of research in the field of ERP lies in the efference copy. This predictive mechanism plays a central role in for example human verbalization. Efference copies, however, do not only occur with spoken words, but also with inner language - i.e. the quiet production of words - which has also been proven by event-related potentials.

Other ERPs used frequently in research, especially neurolinguistics research, include the ELAN, the N400, and the P600/SPS. The analysis of ERP data is also increasingly supported by machine learning algorithms.

=== Number of trials ===
A common issue in ERP studies is whether the observed data have a sufficient number of trials to support statistical analysis. The background noise in any ERP for any individual can vary. Therefore simply characterizing the number of ERP trials needed for a robust component response is inadequate. ERP researchers can use metrics like the standardized measurement error (SME) to justify the examination of between-condition or between-group differences or estimates of internal consistency to justify the examination of individual differences.

<text>The USS &quot;San Diego&quot; (CL-53) was an light cruiser of the United States Navy, commissioned just after the US entry into World War II, and active throughout the Pacific theater. Armed with 16 5 in (127 mm)/38 cal DP anti-aircraft guns and 16 Bofors 40 mm AA guns, the &quot;Atlanta&quot;-class cruisers had one of the heaviest anti-aircraft broadsides of any warship of World War II.

&quot;San Diego&quot; was one of the most decorated US ships of World War II, being awarded 18 battle stars, and was the first major Allied warship to enter Tokyo Bay after the surrender of Japan. Decommissioned in 1946, the ship was sold for scrapping in December 1960.

== Construction ==
&quot;San Diego&quot; was laid down on 27 March 1940 by Bethlehem Steel in Quincy, Massachusetts, sponsored by Grace Legler Benbough (wife of Percy J. Benbough, then-mayor of San Diego), launched on 26 July 1941, and acquired by the Navy and commissioned on 10 January 1942.

The City of San Diego selected U. S. Representative Edouard V. M. Izac (D-California), a retired lieutenant commander, to present a silver service set for use on the cruiser.

== Service history ==

=== 1942–1943 ===
After shakedown training in Chesapeake Bay, &quot;San Diego&quot; sailed via the Panama Canal to the west coast, arriving at her namesake city on 16 May 1942. Escorting at best speed, &quot;San Diego&quot; barely missed the Battle of Midway. On 15 June, she began escort duty for in operations in the South Pacific. Early in August, she supported the first American offensive of the war, the invasion of the Solomons at Guadalcanal. With powerful air and naval forces, the Japanese fiercely contested the American thrust and inflicted heavy damage; &quot;San Diego&quot; witnessed the sinking of on 15 September and of &quot;Hornet&quot; on 26 October.

&quot;San Diego&quot; gave antiaircraft protection for as part of the decisive three-day Naval Battle of Guadalcanal from 12–15 November 1942. After several months of service in the dangerous waters surrounding the Solomon Islands, &quot;San Diego&quot; sailed via Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, to Auckland New Zealand, for replenishment.

At Noumea, New Caledonia, the light cruiser joined &quot;Saratoga&quot;, the only American carrier available in the South Pacific, and in support of the invasion of Munda, New Georgia, and of Bougainville. On 5 November and 11 November 1943, she joined &quot;Saratoga&quot; and in highly successful raids against Rabaul. &quot;San Diego&quot; served as part of Operation Galvanic, the capture of Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands. She escorted , damaged by a torpedo, to Pearl Harbor for repairs on 9 December. &quot;San Diego&quot; continued on to San Francisco for installation of modern radar equipment, a Combat Information Center and 40 mm antiaircraft guns to replace her obsolete 1.1 in (27 mm) batteries.

=== 1944 ===
She joined Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher&#x27;s Fast Carrier Task Force at Pearl Harbor in January 1944 and served as an important part of that mighty force for the remainder of the war. Her rapid-fire guns protected the carriers against aerial attack. &quot;San Diego&quot; participated in &quot;Operation Flintlock&quot;, the capture of Majuro and Kwajalein, and &quot;Catchpole&quot;, the invasion of Eniwetok, in the Marshall Islands from 31 January to 4 March. During this period, Task Force 58 (TF 58) delivered a devastating attack against Truk, the Japanese naval base known as the &quot;Gibraltar of the Pacific.&quot;

&quot;San Diego&quot; steamed back to San Francisco for more additions to her radar and then rejoined the carrier force at Majuro in time to join in raids against Wake and Marcus Islands in June. She was part of the carrier force covering the invasion of Saipan, participated in strikes against the Bonin Islands, and shared in the victory of the First Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19–20 June. After a brief replenishment stop at Eniwetok, &quot;San Diego&quot; and her carriers supported the invasion of Guam and Tinian, struck at Palau, and conducted the first carrier raids against the Philippines. On 6 and 8 August, she stood by as the carriers gave close air support to Marines landing on Peleliu, Palau Islands.

On 21 September, the Task Force struck at the Manila Bay area. After replenishing at Saipan and Ulithi, she sailed with TF 38 in its first strike against Okinawa. From 12–15 October, the carriers pounded the airfields of Formosa while &quot;San Diego&quot;″s guns shot down two of the nine Japanese attackers in her sector and drove the others away; however, some enemy planes got through and damaged and . &quot;San Diego&quot; helped escort the two crippled cruisers out of danger to Ulithi. After rejoining the fast carrier force, she successfully rode out Typhoon Cobra in December, despite heavy rolling of the ship.

=== 1945 ===
In January 1945, TF 38 entered the South China Sea for attacks against Formosa, Luzon, Indochina, and southern China. The force struck Okinawa before returning to Ulithi for replenishment.

&quot;San Diego&quot; next participated in carrier operations against the home islands of Japan, the first since the Doolittle Raid of 1942. The carrier force finished the month of February with strikes against Iwo Jima.

On 1 March, &quot;San Diego&quot; and other cruisers were detached from the carrier force to bombard Okino Daijo Island in support of the landings on Okinawa. After another visit to Ulithi, she joined in carrier strikes against Kyūshū, again shooting down or driving away enemy planes attacking the carriers. On the night of 27–28 March, &quot;San Diego&quot; participated in the shelling of Minami Daito Jima; on 11 April, and again on 16 April, her guns shot down two attackers. She helped furnish anti-aircraft protection for ships damaged by suicide attacks and escorted them to safety. After a stop at Ulithi, she continued as part of the carrier force supporting the invasion of Okinawa, until she entered an advanced base drydock at Guiuan, Samar Island, Philippines, for repairs and maintenance.

She then served once more with the carrier force operating off the coast of Japan from 10 July until hostilities ceased. On 27 August, &quot;San Diego&quot; was the first major Allied warship to enter Tokyo Bay since the beginning of the war, and she helped in the occupation of the Yokosuka Naval Base and the surrender of the Japanese battleship . After having steamed over 300,000 mi (480,000 km) in the Pacific, she returned to San Francisco on 14 September 1945. &quot;San Diego&quot; gave further service as part of &quot;Operation Magic Carpet&quot; in bringing American troops home.

=== Decommissioning and sale ===
&quot;San Diego&quot; was decommissioned and placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet on 4 November 1946, berthed at Bremerton, Washington. She was redesignated CLAA-53 on 18 March 1949. 10 years later, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, on 1 March 1959. She was sold in December 1960 to Todd Shipyards, Seattle, Washington. Her bell is on the current &quot;San Diego&quot; (LPD-22).

<text>Bookworm is a general name for any insect that is said to bore through books.

The damage to books that is commonly attributed to &quot;bookworms&quot; is often caused by the larvae of various types of insects, including beetles, moths, and cockroaches, which may bore or chew through books seeking food. The damage is not caused by any species of worm. Some such larvae exhibit a superficial resemblance to worms and are the likely inspiration for the term, though they are not true worms. In other cases, termites, carpenter ants, and woodboring beetles will first infest wooden bookshelves and later feed on books placed upon the shelves, attracted by the wood-pulp paper used in most commercial book production.

True book-borers are uncommon. The primary food sources for many &quot;bookworms&quot; are the leather or cloth bindings of a book, the glue used in the binding process, or molds and fungi that grow on or inside books. When the pages themselves are attacked, a gradual encroachment across the surface of one page or a small number of pages is typical, rather than the boring of holes through the entire book.

The term has come to have a second, idiomatic meaning of a bibliophile, who reads a great deal or to perceived excess: someone who devours books metaphorically.

== Booklice ==
The booklouse, also known as a paperlouse, is a soft-bodied, wingless insect in the order Psocoptera (usually &quot;Trogium pulsatorium&quot;), typically 1 mm or less in length. Booklice feed on microscopic molds and other organic matter found in or on aging items that have been stored in places that lack the climate control necessary to inhibit organic growth. Areas of archives, libraries, and museums that are cool, damp, dark, and generally undisturbed are common sites for such growth, generating a food source which subsequently attracts booklice. Booklice will also attack bindings, glue, and paper.

Despite their name, booklice are not considered to be true lice, as they do not feed on a living host.

By the 20th century, bookbinding materials had developed a high resistance against damage by various types of book-boring insects. Many museums and archives in possession of materials vulnerable to booklouse damage employ pest control methods to manage existing infestations and make use of climate control to prevent the growth of potential booklouse food sources.

==Other book-eating insects==

===Beetles===
Of the quarter million species of beetles, some adults damage books by eating paper and binding materials themselves. However, their larvae do the most damage. Typically eggs are laid on the book&#x27;s edges and spine. Upon hatching, they bore into, and sometimes even through, the book.
====Woodboring beetles====
*Common furniture beetle
*Deathwatch beetle
*The genus &quot;Gastrallus&quot;
*Indian bookworm beetle
*Australian spider beetle
*Cigarette beetle
*Drugstore beetle

====Auger beetles====
*Lesser grain borer

====Long horned beetles====
*House longhorn beetle

====Bark beetles====
*Flat bark beetle
*Merchant beetle
*Sawtoothed grain beetle

====True weevils====
*Rice weevil
*Wheat weevil

====Skin beetles====
These beetles have been known to feed on leather bindings.
*Furniture carpet beetle
*Museum beetle
*Common carpet beetle
*Varied carpet beetle
*Fur beetle
*Black carpet beetle
*&quot;Dermestes coarctatus&quot;
*Larder beetle 
*&quot;Dermestes maculatus&quot;
*&quot;Dermestes vorax&quot;
*Khapra beetle
*&quot;Reesa&quot;
*&quot;Trogoderma versicolor&quot;
*Odd beetle

====Powderpost beetles====
*African powderpost beetle
*Brown powderpost beetle 
*Black powderpost beetle

====Darkling beetles====
*Confused flour beetle
*Destructive flour beetle
*Dark mealworm beetle
*Mealworm
*Red flour beetle

===Termites===
Termites are the most devastating type of book-eating pest. They will eat almost every part of a book including paper, cloth, and cardboard, not to mention the damage that can be done to shelves. Termites can make entire collections unusable before the infestation is even noticed.
*Powderpost termite
*Western drywood termite
===Ants===
Some species of ants can damage books in a way that is similar to termites.
*Black carpenter ant
*&quot;Camponotus obscuripes&quot;
*Hercules ant

===Moths===
Clothes moths will, in addition to attacking clothes and fabrics, also feed on bookbindings, decaying organic material (which includes paper), and mold.

====Fungus moths====
*Carpet moth
*Case-bearing clothes moth
*Common clothing moth 

====Pyralid moths====
*Mediterranean flour moth
*Indianmeal moth
*Warehouse moth

====Concealer moths====
*brown house moth

===Cockroaches===
Book-damaging cockroach species chew away at the starch in cloth bindings and paper. Their droppings can also harm books.

====Wood cockroaches====
*German cockroach

====Household cockroaches====
*American cockroach
*Oriental cockroach
*Smokybrown cockroach
*Australian cockroach

===Zygentoma===
These insects consume portions of books that contain polysaccharides. Paper that is slightly ragged at the edges is usually the work of silverfish.
====Lepismatidae====
*Firebrat
*Silverfish
==Management==
Human awareness of bookworms dates back to the Middle Ages, when infested books were identified and burned.

Pesticides can be used to protect books from these insects, but they are often made with harsh chemicals that make them an unattractive option. Museums and universities that want to keep their archives bookworm free without using pesticides often turn towards temperature control. Books can be stored at low temperatures that keep eggs from hatching, or placed in a deep-freezer to kill larvae and adults. The idea was taken from commercial food storage practices, as they are often dealing with the same pests.
 Pseudoscorpions such as &quot;Chelifer cancroides&quot; may live in books and feed on book-eating insects, controlling their numbers.

==In human culture==
Bookworms were one of the threats to book preservation identified by 19th Century collector and printer William Blades in his work &quot;The Enemies of Books&quot;. How to protect papyrus, paper (and later parchment) collections from bugs is a topic that already Aristotle was interested in and that kept librarians busy through the centuries.

The term bookworm is also used idiomatically to describe an avid or voracious reader, or a bibliophile. In its earliest iterations, it had a negative connotation, referring to someone who would rather read than participate in the world around them. Over the years its meaning has drifted in a more positive direction.

&quot;Bookworm&quot; is a word-forming puzzle video game developed by PopCap Games that follows Lex, an actual bookworm who accompanies the player as they form words from the deck. From a grid of available letters, players connect letters to form words. The game was well received by various audiences and has become the most downloaded word puzzle game, being downloaded over 100 million times. The game was given a follow-up entitled &quot;Bookworm Adventures&quot;.

<text>Llwynhendy (sometimes spelled Llwyn-Hendy), is a village and ward near the town of Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, Wales. The ward, which includes the village, as well as Cefncaeau, parts of Cwmcarnhywel and parts of Bryn and Penceilogi, had a population of 4,276.

It is bordered by Bynea, Cwmcarnhywel, Cefncaeau and Pen-y-graig. It is an old village with strong industrial roots. The (now closed) steel-works in nearby Bynea was a major employer until the decline of the steel industry. The village is 50 ft above sea level and is based around the Nant Caerhuan that finds its source in nearby Gelli Farm, Bryn, Llanelli.
The nearby Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust site in the old Penclacwydd farm near the village is the only wetland wildlife trust centre in the whole of Wales.

==History==
People have been living in the Llwynhendy area since Neolithic times. During the Iron Age the Llwynhendy and Bynea area was an important place as it was the river crossing of the River Loughor () for the Romans. The main Roman Road ran through the villages and is now still in use as the main road which includes Pemberton Road, Heol Llwynhendy, Heol Tanygraig, Heol Cwmfelin, Heol Y Bwlch and Yspitty Road. This may have carried on into the early Middle Ages as the village may have bordered the regions of Ystrad Tywi and Glywysing.

Llwynhendy was also an important place for pilgrims on the way to the Saint David&#x27;s Cathedral in Pembrokeshire. Opposite Saint David&#x27;s church in Llwynhendy stood Capel Dewi (&quot;St David&#x27;s Chapel&quot;), a chapel of rest/ease where pilgrims travelling could stop. Today only ruins remain.

Llwynhendy became a mining village during the industrial revolution, with Tirmynydd, Hendre, Trallwm and Pencoed mines being opened. However it has always been an agricultural area as well and to this day there are many farms surrounding the village.

With the mines closing during the 1940s and 50s less work was available, until Trostre Works opened. With more people needed two council estates between Llwynhendy and Pemberton were constructed on the lands of Heol Hen Farm and Brynsierfel Farm. Cwmcarnhywel and Cefncaeau estates are locally known as the Top or bottom site (Welsh-Maesydd Pen a Gwaelod) and they are villages of their own, but are sometimes considered part of Llwynhendy.

== Notable people ==
* Douglas Bassett (1927–2009), geologist and a director of the National Museum of Wales from 1977 to 1985.
* Terry Davies MBE (1933–2021), rugby player for Swansea and Llanelli, with 21 caps for Wales

==Welsh language==
The Welsh language is spoken by over half of the villagers, with Ysgol Gymraeg Brynsierfel in nearby Cwmcarnhywel the area&#x27;s Welsh school. Historically Welsh has been the dominant language of the village, and up until the mid-1900s spoken by all of its population.

== Religion ==
Llwynhendy is served by three places of worship- Capel Soar, Capel Y Tabenacl and St. Davids Church (). Recently closed Capel Nazareth on Parc Gitto was the place of worship for the Methodists. 
Before baptism was legal in Great Britain, the baptists of the Llwynhendy area used to meet in Tŷ Cwrdd Farm () on Heol Hendre, Llwynhendy.

==Education==
Llwynhendy is served by two schools. Ysgol Gymraeg Brynsierfel, the Welsh school in nearby Cwmcarnhywel, and Ysgol Bryn Teg, the English school, which is the old Llwynhendy School.

<doc id="614245" wikidata="Q336852" url="?curid=614245" title="Jonathan Guinness, 3rd Baron Moyne">
<text>Jonathan Bryan Guinness, 3rd Baron Moyne (born 16 March 1930), is a British peer, businessman and writer. A member of the Guinness family, he is the elder of the two sons of Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne, and his first wife Diana Mitford (later Lady Mosley). Until his retirement, he was a non-executive director of Guinness plc and a merchant banker with Messrs Leopold Joseph.

==Early life==
Guinness was educated at Eton College and the University of Oxford. He worked as a journalist and then as a merchant banker. From 1970 to 1974 he was a member of Leicestershire County Council.

==Conservative Party==
Guinness stood twice unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for the Conservative Party, at both the 1973 Lincoln by-election (notable for the election of Dick Taverne) and the 1976 Coventry North West by-election.

==Monday Club==
He was a long-standing and early member (1968) of the Conservative Monday Club, serving on several of its committees. He was a member of the club&#x27;s executive council in 1971, when he became chairman of their &#x27;Action Fund&#x27;. In the spring 1972 edition of &quot;Monday World&quot; he contributed an article titled &quot;The Club Today – Opportunities and Growing Pains&quot;. He was subsequently elected national chairman on 5 June following, fighting off challenges from Richard Body MP and Timothy Stroud.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; referred to his election as &quot;a right-wing victory&quot;. At the club&#x27;s annual general meeting in April 1973 Guinness retained the chairmanship for another year, defeating George Kennedy Young by 30 percent of the vote. In mid-1974 he was invited to address conservative students at Portsmouth Polytechnic, but was &quot;prevented from entering by a solid wall of militant protesters hurling abuse&quot;. Guinness was a supporter of Rhodesia and, with John Stokes and the Lord Barnby addressed a Monday Club meeting on the issue in 1974 in Caxton Hall.

On 10 October 1989, at the Conservative Party Conference, he chaired a fringe meeting organised by the Young Monday Club, advertised as &quot;The End of the English? – Immigration and Repatriation&quot;. The other speakers were MPs Tim Janman and Nicholas Budgen.

As chairman of the club&#x27;s Race Relations &amp; Immigration Committee, he also wrote the same month to all Club members; &quot;There has been a lot of ill-thought out agitation following events in China, urging the government to amend the British Nationality Act so as to give the right of UK residence to more than three million people from Hong Kong who hold British passports. At the time of writing the government has stayed firm on this, but it is under pressure. If you have not already done so, please write to your M.P., your local and national newspapers, or the Prime Minister expressing support for the government&#x27;s stand. Remember, a passport is not a residence permit, but a travel document; and think of the sheer physical burden of housing and accommodating a sudden influx of this size.&quot;

He was also Club Vice-Chairman until late 1990 when he was replaced by Andrew Hunter, MP.

==Trustor==

Lord Moyne was accused of involvement in a Swedish financial scandal. The case concerns a now defunct Swedish investment company, Trustor, of which Lord Moyne was made a figurehead director. It was alleged that Guinness was involved in the disappearance of £50,000,000 from Trustor&#x27;s accounts, £35,000,000 of which were soon found on Trustor AB:s own bank account as they had never left the company. Guinness maintained that he was innocent of any wrongdoing, claiming he has been &quot;stitched up&quot;. During the proceedings, Swedish authorities were successful in obtaining a freezing order over what little assets he had left. He was found innocent by the Swedish court.

==Support for Falun Gong==
Lord Moyne has spoken in support of the Falun Gong movement in China since it was banned there in 1999, as reported in Hansard.

==Director of Guinness plc==
Lord Moyne was a non-executive director from 1960 to 1988 of the company set up by his family. His book &quot;Requiem for a Family Business&quot; gives an uninvolved insider&#x27;s account of the corporate developments leading to the Guinness share-trading fraud.

==Personal life and family==
Lord Moyne has been married twice and has eight children.

He married firstly, in 1951 (marriage dissolved 1963), Ingrid Wyndham; later the wife of his cousin Lord Kelvedon, with issue:

* Hon. Catherine Ingrid Guinness (born 1 June 1952), married firstly James Charteris, 13th Earl of Wemyss, and secondly Robert Hesketh.
* Hon. Jasper Jonathan Richard Guinness (9 March 1954 – 7 May 2011), who was married with two daughters.
* Hon. Valentine Guy Bryan Guinness (born 9 March 1959), heir apparent to the Barony of Moyne.

Lord Moyne married secondly, in 1964, Suzanne Lisney (died 2005 of lung cancer), with issue:

* Hon. Sebastian Walter Denis Guinness (born 1964), who has been twice married without issue. 
* Hon. Daphne Suzannah Diana Guinness (born 1967), socialite, who married in 1987 (marriage dissolved 1999) Spyros Niarchos (born 1955), by whom she has three children.

By his mistress Susan &quot;Shoe&quot; Taylor (1944–2003), Lord Moyne has three more children:

* Diana Guinness (born 1981)
* Aster Guinness (born 1984)
* Thomas Guinness-Taylor (born 1986)

To avert a scandal over the extramarital affair with Taylor, Lord Moyne published &quot;Shoe – The Odyssey of a Sixties Survivor&quot; in 1989. &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper ran a double-page article with pictures entitled &quot;Always a Mistress – Never the Bride&quot; on 6 July 1989.

Moyne and his daughter Daphne both had letters published in the same edition of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; (16 August 2003) attacking the writer Andrew Roberts over his criticism in the same newspaper on 13 August 2003 of Jonathan&#x27;s mother, Lady Mosley, following her death.

Lord Moyne&#x27;s younger brother, Desmond Guinness, died in August 2020.

<text>USS &quot;Spokane&quot; (CL-120/CLAA-120/AG-191) was the second ship of the light cruiser of the United States Navy.

==Construction and career==
She was laid down on 15 November 1944 at the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Kearny, New Jersey; launched on 22 September 1945, sponsored by Miss Patrice Munsel; and commissioned on 17 May 1946.

&quot;Spokane&quot; shifted to Bayonne, New Jersey, and then to Brooklyn, New York, where she sailed on 24 June for Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, for her shakedown cruise and to conduct battle practice and weapons firing. She returned to New York on 11 September. The cruiser was assigned to the 2nd Fleet for duty in European waters, and sailed for Plymouth, England, on 7 October.

&quot;Spokane&quot; operated out of British ports until mid-January 1947. During her tour, she visited Scotland, Ireland, Norway, and Denmark. On 27 January, she stood out of Plymouth and proceeded to the United States via Portugal, Gibraltar, and Guantánamo Bay, where she participated in fleet exercises before arriving at Norfolk, Virginia, on 18 March. Following fleet and bombardment exercises in the Chesapeake Bay during the summer, she had a period of yard availability at the Brooklyn Navy Yard from 22 September to 14 October. The cruiser returned to Norfolk for Navy Day, 27 October, and then prepared for another deployment.

&quot;Spokane&quot; stood out of Norfolk on 29 October, and rendezvoused with other units of the 2nd Task Fleet for tactical exercises off Bermuda until 8 November, when she sailed for England. She arrived at Plymouth on 16 November, and was assigned to duty with Naval Forces, Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. Four days later, the ship donned &quot;full dress&quot; in celebration of the marriage of Her Royal Highness, Princess Elizabeth of England. The cruiser visited Bremerhaven, Germany from 24–26 November, and returned to England for tactical operations. In February 1948, the ship called at Rotterdam, Netherlands, where she was visited by his Royal Highness Prince Bernhard on 17 February. On 1 March, &quot;Spokane&quot; stood out of Plymouth en route to the east coast, and arrived at Norfolk on 11 March. On 18 March, her designation was changed to CLAA-120.

&quot;Spokane&quot;″s operations along the eastern seaboard during the remainder of the year were broken by an overhaul at the New York Navy Yard from 27 May-15 September. On 4 January 1949, the ship sortied with and for the Mediterranean. On 25 January, at Athens, the cruiser was paid a royal visit by King Paul and Queen Fredrika of Greece. &quot;Spokane&quot; participated in war games with 6th Fleet units, and visited ports in Turkey, Italy, France, Sardinia, Tunisia, Libya, and Algeria before returning to Norfolk on 23 May.

&quot;Spokane&quot; acted as a training ship for Naval Reserves of the 4th Naval District during the summer and then participated in training exercises in the Virginia Capes area.

===Decommissioning===
On 24 October 1949, &quot;Spokane&quot; sailed to New York for inactivation. She was placed in reserve, out of commission, on 27 February 1950, and berthed at New York. On 1 April 1966, she received the new hull number AG-191, to be used as a sonar test ship. &quot;Spokane&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 April 1972. She was sold to Luria Brothers &amp; Company, Inc., on 17 May 1973 and scrapped.

<doc id="614250" wikidata="Q725432" url="?curid=614250" title="François-Jean de la Barre">
<text>François-Jean Lefebvre de la Barre (12 September 17451 July 1766) was a French nobleman. He was tortured and beheaded before his body was burnt on a pyre along with Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot; nailed to his torso. La Barre is often said to have been executed for not saluting a Catholic religious procession, though other charges of a similar nature were laid against him.

In France, Lefebvre de la Barre is widely regarded a symbol of the victims of Catholic religious intolerance, along with Jean Calas and Pierre-Paul Sirven, all championed by Voltaire. A statue to de la Barre stands near the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Paris at the summit of the butte Montmartre (itself named from the &quot;Temple of Mars&quot;), the highest point in Paris, and an 18th arrondissement street nearby the Sacré-Cœur is also named after Lefebvre de la Barre.

Lefebvre de la Barre was a descendant of Antoine Lefèbvre de La Barre, a governor of the French Antilles and then New France.

==Voltaire&#x27;s versions==
Voltaire&#x27;s two accounts of the story were polemic and not history, and contradict each other. The first, &quot;Relation de la mort du chevalier de la Barre, par M. Cassen, avocat au conseil du roi, à M. le marquis de Beccaria&quot; (1766), blames Belleval, a neighbor of la Barre&#x27;s &quot;aunt&quot; (this account was almost immediately criticized by a local Abbeville printer for numerous inaccuracies). &quot;Le Cri du sang innocent&quot; (1775) omits all mention of Belleval and shifts the blame to Duval de Soicourt, the judge in the case (this version largely follows Simon-Nicholas Henri Linguet&#x27;s memoir &quot;Pour les sieurs Moisnel, Dumesniel de Saveuse et Douville de Maillefeu injustement impliqués dans l&#x27;affaire de la mutilation d&#x27;un crucifix, arrivée à Abbeville le 9 Août 1765&quot; (Paris, 1766).). Voltaire notably emphasizes the role of the Church, although the prosecution was entirely secular (albeit based on Old Regime law, which assumed Catholicism as the state religion and so defined a number of offenses based on religion, such as sacrilege and blasphemy). The only specific efforts by the Church hierarchy were in favor of commuting the planned execution into life imprisonment, as requested by the Bishop of Amiens.

==Events==

On 9 August 1765, the wooden crucifix on a bridge in Abbeville was vandalized. Catholicism was then the state religion of France and the religion of the vast majority of the French public, especially in the devout town of Abbeville, where this act caused widespread shock and anger. Voltaire says that , the bishop of Amiens, roused the furor of the faithful and asked churchgoers to reveal all they could about the case to the civilian judges, under pain of excommunication; however, Chassaigne says that he came (at the town fathers&#x27; request) to calm emotions but that the ceremony had the opposite effect. The church was obliged under secular law to make the proclamations looking for witnesses (Voltaire mentions these proclamations, without clarifying that fact). Nobody actually revealed anything about the vandalism itself, but Du Maisniel de Belleval, a local judge who had quarreled with young la Barre, gathered damaging evidence against a group of friends (possibly not realizing his own son was part of the group).

Among other things, it came out that three young men, Gaillard d&#x27;Etallonde, Jean-François de la Barre, and Moisnel had not removed their hats when a Corpus Christi procession went by. This incident is often cited as the main basis for the charges. But numerous other blasphemies were alleged as well, including defecation on another crucifix, singing impious songs and spitting on religious images.

Soon, Douville de Maillefeu (son of a former mayor) and Belleval&#x27;s own son Saveuse were also implicated. But these two along with d&#x27;Etallonde – also the son of a former mayor – managed to flee, and ultimately only d&#x27;Etallonde was named (in absentia) along with la Barre in the sentence. (Though no culprit was identified in the specific attack, Moisnel testified that he had seen d&#x27;Etallonde strike the statue with his cane on previous occasions. D&#x27;Etallonde appears in much of the testimony as the leader and instigator of the group of friends.) The only two who ended up in custody – Moisnel and la Barre – were both orphans and from outside Abbeville.

During the inquiry, la Barre&#x27;s bedroom was searched and among his mainly pornographic prohibited books, Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot; was found - providing a pretext to blame the Philosophes for the young men&#x27;s misbehavior.

On 20 February 1766, Duval de Soicourt and two other local judges handed down the sentence:
Regarding Jean-Francois Lefebvre, chevalier de La Barre, we declare him convicted of having taught to sing and sung impious, execrable and blasphemous songs against God; of having profaned the sign of the cross in making blessings accompanied by foul words which modesty does not permit repeating; of having knowingly refused the signs of respect to the Holy Sacrament carried in procession by the priory of Saint-Pierre; of having shown these signs of adoration to foul and abominable books that he had in his room; of having profaned the mystery of the consecration of wine, having mocked it, in pronouncing the impure terms mentioned in the trial record over a glass of wine which he held in his hand and then drunken the wine; of having finally proposed to Petignat, who was serving mass with him, to bless the cruets while pronouncing the impure words mentioned in the trial record.
Note that this sentence does not mention the mutilation of a cross which had provoked the original inquiry.

Despite Voltaire&#x27;s later claim that the court had applied an old obscure sentence for witchcraft, this sentence conformed to the statutory penalty for blasphemy and sacrilege. It is less certain however that this penalty was usually applied in practice, and Linguet later highlighted a number of defects in the legal forms of the case.

On 4 June, the Paris Parlement (more a judicial than a legislative body) confirmed the sentence on appeal. It is sometimes claimed that it added the relatively standard stipulation that la Barre be tortured just before being executed. Typically this was done to oblige the accused to reveal any accomplices. However, the Abbeville sentence already included this stipulation and the note that the Dictionary should be burned as well. The key significance of the Parlement&#x27;s confirmation was to give judicial legitimacy to a sentence that Voltaire and Linguet, among others, would later portray as the result of petty local quarrels. Chassaigne notes however that the Parlement itself might have had its own political reasons for its decision.

On 1 July, la Barre was tortured early in the morning. Though he appears to have been with others when he committed some of the lesser acts named in the sentence, he refused to name any even under torture. Later the same day he was beheaded and his body burned, the ashes thrown in the Somme River. Voltaire&#x27;s work was burned along with la Barre&#x27;s body.

== Later views of the case ==
===Linguet===
Voltaire, at first horrified by the attention the affair drew to him, ended up defending la Barre&#x27;s memory and helping d&#x27;Etallonde, whom he even received as a houseguest at Ferney. His first paper probably played a large part in the charges against the younger Belleval and Douville being dropped. His second was an attempt (unsuccessful) to obtain a pardon for d&#x27;Etallonde.

In 1778, Linguet, la Barre&#x27;s own defender, criticized him harshly, though largely as a way of attacking the influence of the Philosophes with whom Linguet was quarreling by then:

…this dirty wretch of Chevalier de la Barre. They have tried to pass him off as a budding great man, sacrificed by a religious barbarism, as a martyr of Philosophy; he was only so by very profane perversity, armed with his own indiscretion.



He goes on to say that la Barre&#x27;s youth might have earned him some consideration had it not been for the need to make an example, and explicitly blames the Philosophes for having set la Barre&#x27;s mind on fire. (Note that the trial record itself says little or nothing about such influence; the idea that the actions of la Barre and his friends were inspired by larger ideas, rather than adolescent discontent, is based almost wholly on the presence of a few books in his library.)

The sentence was reversed by the National Convention during the French Revolution in 1794.

In 1895, Jean Cruppi wrote an overview of Linguet&#x27;s role in the case (which also includes a detailed and documented look at the case itself, including quotes from la Barre&#x27;s interrogation under torture). He ends with this observation:
===Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;===
A later reference to the torture and execution of la Barre can be found in the first pages of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1859):

===Other works===
Marc Chassaigne&#x27;s &quot;Le procès du Chevalier de la Barre&quot; (Paris, 1920) and Max Gallo&#x27;s &quot;Que passe la justice du Roi&quot; (Paris, 1987); both books (in French) are extensive studies of this affair.

==Posthumous tributes==
===Paris – Montemartre===

The Freemasons of the Grand Orient of France and other organized freethinkers obtained the elevation of the first Chevalier de la Barre statue in Paris as &quot;the antidote in front of poison&quot; to the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Paris (Sacré-Cœur) on Montmartre during 1897. The Municipal Council of Paris during 1904 recovered 5000 m2 of land wrongfully retained by the archdiocese and decided to award a 5,000-franc grant toward the completion of the statue at this location in line with the great portal of the Sacré-Cœur, Paris.

A full-size mock-up of the statue and base, as sculpted by freethinker Armand Bloch, was inaugurated on 3 September 1905 at the Congress of Freethinkers. The following year, 1906, the statue was cast in bronze and was placed &#x27;provisionally&#x27; by the Paris City Council at the gate of the Sacré-Cœur basilica during a ceremony which was attended by approximately 25,000 spectators.

In 1926 the statue of the Chevalier de la Barre on Montmartre was moved away from the approach of the basilica entrance to the nearby and lower elevation of Square Nadar. This original Chevalier de la Barre statue by Bloch was eventually toppled on 11 October 1941 and melted down with other non-religious statues by the Vichy France regime under Marshal and Chief of State of Vichy France Philippe Pétain.
The Paris City Council decided on 24 February 2001 to erect a new statue of the Chevalier de la Barre at the Square Nadar. It is the work of sculptor Emmanuel Ball.

&quot;Rue du Chevalier de La Barre&quot; is a Paris street that is located behind the Sacré-Cœur, between the Rue Ramey and the Rue du Mont-Cenis and also is the postal street address of the Sacré-Cœur basilica.

===Abbeville===
The Freemasons of the Grand Orient of France placed a bouquet of flowers during a 1902 memorial at the Abbeville location of la Barre execution site, forming the creation of the group la Barre that was organized as a ceremonial event running through the city center of Abbeville.

A la Barre monument was first erected on the banks of the Canal de la Somme at the la Barre execution site in Abbeville in 1907 with funds collected by voluntary subscription and the obelisk with its bronze plaque depicting the la Barre torture and execution remains standing today.

The bronze plaque depicting the torture of the Chevalier Lefebvre de la Barre was temporarily removed from the la Barre monument during the World War II military occupation of France and hidden in a creek for safekeeping from the Vichy France regime. Under this plate reads &quot;In Commemoration of the Martyrdom of the Chevalier de La Barre tortured in Abbeville on 1 July 1766 at the age of 19 years for failing to salute a procession.&quot; At the base is inscribed the date of the inauguration: &quot;7 July 1907.&quot;

Today, the la Barre name and both the Abbeville monument and Parisian statue of la Barre have become iconic representations of the victims of religious intolerance in France and are regarded as rallying points for freethinkers. Three associations exist with the name of the Chevalier de la Barre in Paris, Abbeville, and the Masonic Lodge of the Grand Orient of France in Bergerac.

The Abbeville monument to the Chevalier de la Barre was vandalized on 22 June 2013 by supporters of the .

<text>Sir Henry Thomas Tizard (23 August 1885 – 9 October 1959) was an English chemist, inventor and Rector of Imperial College, who developed the modern &quot;octane rating&quot; used to classify petrol, helped develop radar in World War II, and led the first serious studies of UFOs.

==Life==
Tizard was born in Gillingham, Kent in 1885, the only son of Thomas Henry Tizard (1839–1924), naval officer and hydrographer, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Churchward. His ambition to join the navy was thwarted by poor eyesight, and he instead studied at Westminster School and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he concentrated on mathematics and chemistry, doing work on indicators and the motions of ions in gases. Tizard graduated in 1908 and at his tutor&#x27;s suggestion, he spent time in Berlin, where he met and formed a close friendship with Frederick Alexander Lindemann, later an influential scientific advisor of Winston Churchill. In 1909, he became a researcher in the Davy–Faraday Laboratory of the Royal Institution, working on colour change indicators. In 1911, Tizard returned to Oxford as a tutorial fellow at Oriel College and to work as a demonstrator in the electrical laboratory. On 25 July 1942, Tizard was elected President of Magdalen College, Oxford. He resigned this position in 1946.

Tizard was married on 24 April 1915 to Kathleen Eleanor (d. 1968), daughter of Arthur Prangley Wilson, a mining engineer. They had three sons: Sir (John) Peter Mills Tizard, who became a professor of paediatrics at the University of London and Regius Professor of Physic at Oxford (1916-1993); Richard Henry Tizard (1917–2005), an engineer and senior tutor at Churchill College, Cambridge; and David (b. 1922), a general practitioner in London.

==Career==
===First World War===
&quot;The secret of science&quot;, Tizard once said, &quot;is to ask the right question, and it is the choice of problem more than anything else that marks the man of genius in the scientific world&quot;. His chosen problem became aeronautics. At the outbreak of World War I, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Royal Garrison Artillery on 17 October 1914, in which his training methods were famously bizarre. He later transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, where he became an experimental equipment officer and learned to fly planes after his eyesight improved. He acted as his own test pilot for making aerodynamic observations. When his superior Bertram Hopkinson was moved to the Ministry of Munitions, Tizard went with him. When Hopkinson died in 1918, Tizard took over his post. Tizard served in the Royal Air Force from 1918 to 1919, ending the war at the rank of temporary lieutenant colonel

===Interwar period===
After the end of the war, he was made Reader in Chemical Thermodynamics at Oxford University, where he experimented in the composition of fuel trying to find compounds which were resistant to freezing and less volatile, devising the concept of &quot;toluene numbers&quot;, now referred to as octane ratings. After that work (largely for Shell), he took up again a government post in 1920 as Assistant Secretary to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. His successes in that post (and after promotion to permanent secretary on 1 June 1927) included the establishment of the post of the Chemical Research Laboratory in Teddington, the appointment of Harry Wimperis as Director of Scientific Research to the Air Force and finally the decision to leave to become the President and Rector of Imperial College London in 1929, a position he held until 1942, when he was elected President of Magdalen College, Oxford.

In 1935, the development of radar in the United Kingdom was started by Tizard&#x27;s Aeronautical Research Committee (and Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence, which he chaired since 1933) doing the first experimental work at Orfordness, near Ipswich, before moving to the nearby Bawdsey Research Station (BRS) in 1936. In 1938, Tizard persuaded Mark Oliphant at Birmingham University to drop some of his nuclear research and concentrate on development of an improved source of short-wave radiation. This led to the invention by John Turton Randall and Harry Boot of the cavity magnetron, a major advance in radar technology, which in turn provided the basis for airborne interceptors using radar.

===Second World War===
In September 1940, after a top-secret landmark conference with Winston Churchill—at which his opposition to R.V. Jones&#x27; view that the Germans had established a system of radio-beam bombing aids (Battle of the Beams) over the UK had been overruled—Tizard led what became known as the Tizard Mission to the United States. This introduced to the US—among other things—the newly invented resonant-cavity magnetron (and other British radar developments), the Whittle gas turbine, and the British Tube Alloys (nuclear weapons) project.

===Postwar===
In 1946, Tizard remained in the defence establishment, chairing the Defence Research Policy Committee. He also chaired the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy from 1947 to 1952. In 1948, Tizard returned to the Ministry of Defence as Chief Scientific Adviser, a post he held until 1952. The Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Nick Pope states that: The Ministry of Defence’s UFO Project has its roots in a study commissioned in 1950 by the MOD&#x27;s then Chief Scientific Adviser, the great radar scientist Sir Henry Tizard. As a result of his insistence that UFO sightings should not be dismissed without some form of proper scientific study, the department set up arguably the most marvellously-named committee in the history of the civil service, the Flying Saucer Working Party (FSWP).

Tizard had followed the official debate about ghost rockets with interest and was intrigued by the increasing media coverage of UFO sightings in the United Kingdom, America and other parts of the world. Using his authority as Chief Scientific Adviser at the MOD he decided that the subject should not be dismissed without proper, official investigation. Accordingly, he agreed that a small Directorate of Scientific Intelligence/Joint Technical Intelligence Committee (DSI/JTIC) working party should be set up to investigate the phenomenon. This was dubbed the Flying Saucer Working Party. The DSI/JTIC minutes recording this historic development read as follows:

After discussion, it was agreed that the members of the Working Party should be representatives from DSI1, ADNI(Tech), MI10 and ADI(Tech). It was also agreed that it would probably be necessary at some time to consult the Meteorological Department and ORS Fighter Command, but that these two bodies should not at present be asked to nominate representatives.

One of the most controversial meetings that Tizard had to attend in his capacity as chair of the Defence Research Policy Committee would emerge only many years later with the declassification of CIA documents: a meeting on 1 June 1951 at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, between Tizard, Omond Solandt (chairman of Defence Research and Development Canada) and representatives of the CIA to discuss &quot;brainwashing&quot;.

==Awards and honours==
Tizard was awarded the Air Force Cross on 2 November 1918 in recognition of his contribution to the war effort. In May 1926, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Tizard was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1927, a Knight Commander (KCB) in 1937 and a Knight Grand Cross (GCB) in 1949. Tizard was awarded the 1946 Franklin Medal for his work in the field of engineering and presided over the 1948 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Dundee.

==Death==
Tizard died in Fareham, Hampshire in 1959. His papers are kept at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<doc id="614263" wikidata="Q7874317" url="?curid=614263" title="USS Springfield (CL-66)">
<text>USS &quot;Springfield&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

She was the third US Navy ship to be named after Springfield, Illinois. Commissioned in 1944, she served briefly in the Atlantic before transferring to the Pacific. There she served with fast carrier task forces, primarily in an anti-aircraft role, but also in a shore bombardment role in the last stages of the Pacific War. She earned two battle stars for wartime service. Like all but one of her sister ships, she was decommissioned and laid up soon after the end of World War II.

In the late 1950s she was one of three &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class ships to be converted into guided missile cruisers. As part of this conversion, she was modified to become a flagship, which involved expanding her forward superstructure and removing most of her forward armament. She was recommissioned in 1960 as CLG-7 (later redesignated as CG-7). In her second career, she served entirely in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. She was decommissioned for the final time in 1974 and sold for scrap six years later.

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Springfield&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets.Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-four Bofors guns in four quadruple and four double mounts and twenty-one Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Springfield&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

== Service history ==
===World War II===

The keel for &quot;Springfield&quot; was laid down at the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts on 13 February 1943. She was launched on 9 March 1944 and was completed exactly six months later, being commissioned on 9 September. The ship departed on 7 November to begin her shakedown cruise, stopping first in Norfolk, Virginia, on 9 November. She thereafter conducted shooting practice in Chesapeake Bay for a few days before continuing on to the British West Indies in the Caribbean Sea. On 21 November, she reached Gulf of Paria, Trinidad, and cruised in the area until 21 December, when she sailed north for Boston, her initial shakedown complete.

On 10 January 1945, &quot;Springfield&quot; left Boston for training to prepare her crew for combat operations during World War II. These were held off Bermuda in the Caribbean, and they were completed by 13 January, at which point the ship sailed for Norfolk. Over the following ten days, the ship participated in further shooting practice in the Chesapeake, and her crew completed basic maintenance tasks while in port. On the morning of 23 January, the ship left the harbor as part of Task Group 21.5, the escort for the heavy cruiser , which was carrying President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Malta, on his way to the Yalta Conference. Five days later, the ships reached a point approximately south of the Azores, and a second escort group relieved TG 21.5, permitting &quot;Springfield&quot; to be detached to join the Allied forces fighting Japan in the Pacific War. She passed through the Panama Canal on 5 February and continued on to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, arriving eleven days later.

====Battle of Okinawa====
&quot;Springfield&quot; remained in Pearl Harbor for five days, loading ammunition, fuel, and other supplies in preparation for her deployment to the western Pacific. During this period, her anti-aircraft gunners were given shooting practice. She thereafter got underway for the combat zone, stopping in Eniwetok on 2 March, and arriving in the fleet&#x27;s advance base at Ulithi four days after. On 14 March, she sailed north to join the Fast Carrier Task Force at sea the following day. She operated as part of the defensive screen for the fast aircraft carriers in Task Force 58 for the next three months. On 18 and 19 March, the carriers raided the Japanese home islands of Kyushu and Honshu as part of the preparatory attacks before the upcoming invasion of Okinawa, further to the south. The carriers then moved to target Okinawa directly, beginning a series of raids from 23 March to 1 April. During this period, &quot;Springfield&quot; contributed to the fleet&#x27;s antiaircraft defense as heavy Japanese counterattacks repeatedly struck the ships. She also carried out shore bombardment on the nearby island of Minami Daito.

American forces went ashore on Okinawa on 1 April, and the ships of the Fast Carrier Task Force shifted to provide direct support to the men fighting their way across the island in a campaign that lasted for more than a month. During this period, &quot;Springfield&quot; was primarily used to defend against the heavy Japanese air attacks on Allied forces. These attacks included wide-spread use of the suicide tactics, and &quot;Springfield&quot;″s gunners shot down at least three aircraft attempting to crash into American ships. On 17 April, after shooting down one of these planes, &quot;Springfield&quot; came under attack by a second , whose pilot tried to crash his plane into the ship. Evasive maneuvers allowed the ship to narrowly escape being hit, and the plane crashed into the sea just away.

&quot;Springfield&quot; was detached to bombard Minami Daito again on 10 and 11 May. She thereafter resumed her role as part of the fleet&#x27;s antiaircraft defense for the rest of the month. During this period, on 13 and 14 May, she accompanied the carriers for raids on Japanese airfields on Kyushu, part of an attempt to neutralize the aircraft being used to attack the fleet. &quot;Springfield&quot; remained on station off Okinawa through 28 May.

====Japan campaign====


On 27 May, the Fast Carrier Task Force reverted to the 3rd Fleet under Admiral William Halsey, Jr, replacing the 5th Fleet under Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. The fleet units were accordingly re-numbered from 58 to 38. &quot;Springfield&quot; was detached to Leyte in the Philippines, arriving there three days later for maintenance that lasted for a month. She then departed to re-join the carriers in TF 38, which had begun a series of attacks on the Japanese home islands in anticipation of the invasion of Kyushu. &quot;Springfield&quot; was present for strikes on Tokyo on 10 and 11 July, followed by attacks in northern Japan on 13 and 14 July, including on Hokkaido. &quot;Springfield&quot; participated in a patrol for Japanese merchant shipping on the night of 14–15 July, before returning to cover the carriers for another round of strikes on Tokyo and Yokohama. On 18 July, the carrier planes attacked some of the few Japanese warships remaining afloat, including the battleships and . Over the last week of July, the carriers struck Kobe and Kure repeatedly, and &quot;Springfield&quot; was detached to bombard coastal targets in southern Honshu on the night of 24–25 July. On 30 July, the Fast Carrier Task Force returned to strike Tokyo again, followed by another voyage north to attack northern Honshu and Hokkaido again on 9 and 10 August. The final carrier raids of the war were carried out on 13 August.

On 15 August, Japan announced it would surrender, which ended the fighting. For her service during the war, &quot;Springfield&quot; was awarded two battle stars. On 27 August, &quot;Springfield&quot; joined Task Force 35 as it entered Sagami Bay, outside of Tokyo. She covered the entrance of Task Force 31 into Tokyo Bay three days later, and after that she was sent to take part in the occupation of the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. She thereafter returned to Sagami Bay, where she remained until 3 September, when she moved to Tokyo Bay. She remained there for the next few weeks, and on 20 September, the task force reverted to 5th Fleet. &quot;Springfield&quot; thereafter cruised in East Asian waters in the immediate postwar period as Japanese forces were demilitarized and returned from previously occupied countries. She visited a number of ports, including Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan; Shanghai, Taku, Qingdao, and Qinhuangdao, China; and Jinsen, Korea. These visits continued into January 1946, and on the 9th, she sailed from Qingdao, bound for San Pedro, California, arriving on 25 January. From there, she moved to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for periodic maintenance.

===Postwar career===

====Pacific Fleet and conversion====
&quot;Springfield&quot; operated off the West Coast of the United States for much of the rest of 1946. In November, she returned to the central Pacific, stopping in Guam on 15 November. She thereafter cruised in the area, primarily traveling between Guam and Saipan in the Mariana Islands for the next few months. On 19 February 1947, she left the Marianas to return to California, stopping in Kwajalein Atoll from 25 to 27 February and then Pearl Harbor from 11 to 18 March. She ultimately arrived in San Pedro on 24 March. She cruised off the west coast for the next year and a half, participating in routine training exercises. Another deployment to the western Pacific followed in late 1948; she arrived in Yokosuka on 3 November, where she joined the 7th Fleet. She operated with that unit until mid-May, and during that period, she visited a number of ports in the region, including Sasebo, Kure, Hakodate, Otaru, and Okinawa, Japan; Qingdao and Shanghai, China; and British Hong Kong. The ship returned to California on 1 June 1949, and a little over three months later, she was taken into drydock to be prepared for long-term storage in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She was then formally placed in the reserve fleet in January 1950.

The ship was moored in San Francisco, California, for most of the 1950s. In March 1959, &quot;Springfield&quot; was towed from San Francisco, through the Panama Canal, to Boston for conversion to a guided-missile cruiser. She arrived at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy on 15 May, where work began on rebuilding the ship into a . She received extensive modifications that included replacing her aft turrets with a RIM-2 Terrier surface-to-air missile launcher. Work on the ship continued for more than a year before she was ready for operation. Final conversion work was carried out at the Boston Naval Shipyard. She was re-designated with the hull number CLG-7, and was recommissioned on 2 July 1960. &quot;Springfield&quot; performed sea trials off the coast of New England beginning in July. She then embarked on a shakedown cruise that went as far south as Guantanmo Bay, Cuba, and lasted until November.

====Atlantic and Mediterranean service====
&quot;Springfield&quot; sailed from Boston on 4 December, bound for the Mediterranean Sea. After arriving ten days later, she became the flagship of the 6th Fleet, replacing the heavy cruiser in that role. She served with the 6th Fleet for the next six years, and over this period she was based at Villefranche-sur-Mer, France. She performed a number of functions while the flagship of 6th Fleet. She made goodwill visits to numerous ports in the region, including Dubrovnik and Split, Yugoslavia; Famagusta, Cyprus; and Ajaccio, Corsica. She also participated in frequent training maneuvers held with the entire 6th Fleet and with friendly navies in the region. Because she was the fleet flagship, she also frequently hosted foreign visitors, including King Constantine II of Greece, Princess Grace of Monaco, ambassadors, and senior military and naval officers. During this period, she underwent one major overhaul, which lasted from 11 May to 15 December 1963. &quot;Springfield&quot; was ordered to return home on 20 January 1967; she was relieved as the fleet flagship by the guided-missile cruiser on 28 January. &quot;Springfield&quot; thereafter returned to Boston, stopping in Portsmouth, Great Britain, on the way.

After reaching Boston on 16 February, &quot;Springfield&quot; was dry-docked for another overhaul that lasted almost six months. While work was still being completed on 1 August, &quot;Springfield&quot; was assigned to Norfolk, Virginia. On 6 August, she arrived in Yorktown, Virginia, where she remained for the next month. On 1 September, she became the flagship of the 2nd Fleet, relieving the heavy cruiser . Shortly thereafter, she sailed for the Atlantic Fleet shooting practice grounds to participate in training exercises for her gun and missile crews. The ship stopped in the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Puerto Rico to refuel before embarking on a major cruise to northern European ports. She stopped first in Portsmouth, Great Britain, and thereafter visited Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Lisbon, Portugal; Barcelona, Spain; and Pollensa Bay on the island of Majorca. Her voyage concluded with her return to Norfolk on 6 December.

&quot;Springfield&quot; operated off the East Coast of the United States for most of 1968, participating in routine training exercises with the rest of the fleet based at Norfolk. During this period, she also conducted a training cruise for midshipmen from the United States Naval Academy. She sailed on 12 September to northern Europe to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization training operation Silver Tower, which was held in the Norwegian Sea. By 27 September, the exercises had been completed, and &quot;Springfield&quot; departed for another tour of European ports, including Oslo, Norway; Le Havre, France; Lisbon; Portsmouth; and Rota, Spain, where on 23 October she hosted a meeting between the commanders of 2nd and 6th Fleets. &quot;Springfield&quot; sailed from Rota on 24 October, bound for Norfolk, arriving there on 1 November. She returned to her previous pattern of training exercises off the east coast until early July. &quot;Newport News&quot; relieved &quot;Springfield&quot; as the fleet flagship on 8 July, permitting the latter to be dry-docked for an extensive period of maintenance.

The ship resumed flagship duties for 2nd Fleet on 14 January 1970, replacing &quot;Newport News&quot; in that role once again. She served in that capacity for just seven months, however, before &quot;Newport News&quot; replaced her again so that &quot;Springfield&quot; could deploy to the Mediterranean on 10 August. There, she replaced &quot;Little Rock&quot; as the 6th Fleet flagship on 22 August. &quot;Springfield&quot; cruised in the Mediterranean for the next four years, carrying out a routine similar to her previous tour in the region, visiting ports, hosting foreign dignitaries, and participating in training exercises. President Richard Nixon and the United States Secretary of the Navy attended one meeting aboard the ship during her deployment. While cruising with the 6th Fleet, &quot;Springfield&quot; left the region just four times, visiting Casablanca, Morocco, and Lisbon twice each. In April 1973, flying the flag of Vice Admiral Gerald E. Miller, Commander, Sixth Fleet, she served as the command ship for flood relief operations in Tunisia, after four days of heavy rain had left 40,000 people homeless. Other ships involved included the aircraft carrier , the destroyer , and the amphibious transport dock . On 1 September, &quot;Little Rock&quot; arrived to replace her as the fleet flagship.

&quot;Springfield&quot; passed through Gibraltar and the Azores on the way home, ultimately arriving in Boston on 14 September. Three days later, she departed for Norfolk to begin the process of inactivation to prepare her for another stint in the reserve fleet. By the end of the year, she had entered the Inactive Ship Facility at Portsmouth, Virginia. She was decommissioned on 15 May 1974, assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, and moored in Philadelphia. &quot;Springfield&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 July 1978 and was sold to ship breakers for scrap on 1 March 1980.

<text>Alabama 3 are a British musical group founded in Brixton, London, in 1995. Their track &quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot; was used for the opening credits of the TV series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. In the United States, the band is known as A3, to avoid legal conflict with the country music band Alabama.

==History==
The band formed when Jake Black (born in Glasgow, Scotland; 27 April 1960 – 21 May 2019) met Rob Spragg (from Wales) at a rave in Peckham. They decided that a fusion of country music with acid house was a musical possibility. Other members of the band were added later: Nick Reynolds is the son of one of the Great Train Robbers; Rob Spragg was at university with Piers Marsh, the harmonica-player and synthesiser programmer for the band; while Orlando Harrison, the group&#x27;s keyboardist, used to live with Jake Black.

Forming initially under the name the First Presleyterian Church of Elvis the Divine (UK), and after having been dismissed by the mainstream media as a novelty act, the group switched names to Alabama 3. As with their performances under the previous name, their sound fuses electronic pop with elements of country and blues styles. They signed with One Little Indian Records in 1997 for the release of their debut album, &quot;Exile on Coldharbour Lane&quot;. Every member of the group has an alias, the band&#x27;s founding members adopting the personas Larry Love (Rob Spragg) and The Very Reverend Dr. D. Wayne Love (Jake Black). Their second album, &quot;La Peste&quot;, featured bassist John &quot;Segs&quot; Jennings of the Ruts under the stage name Frank Zappatista.

In August 2007, the group toured under the name of Alabama 3: Acoustic and Unplugged, with Harpo Strangelove and Devlin Love, to promote new album &quot;M.O.R.&quot;. Bassist John &quot;Segs&quot; Jennings left the band, saying he was &quot;busy elsewhere and [he doesn&#x27;t] have the time&quot;. &quot;M.O.R.&quot; included a cover of Jerry Reed&#x27;s 1970s hit &quot;Amos Moses&quot;, and features The Proclaimers on the track &quot;Sweet Joy&quot;. Having recorded and toured with the band in the early days, Aurora Dawn rejoined the band in 2009. Between late 2010 and early 2011, programmer, harmonicist and founding member Piers Marsh left the band.

Jake Black, a founding band member and songwriter, died of Addison&#x27;s disease on 21 May 2019, several days after falling ill during a show at Highest Point Festival in Lancashire. He was 59.

===Mountain of Love===

Mountain of Love is a dubtronica group formed by two of the original three members of Alabama 3, Piers Marsh and Sir Eddie Real, in 2011 in Brixton, London. The band&#x27;s eponymous first album was released in 2013 on Cooked Griffin Records.

==Style==
Alabama 3&#x27;s sound is a blend of country, blues, and acid house. The band&#x27;s songs have sampled Jim Jones in &quot;Mao Tse Tung Said&quot; and Birmingham Six survivor Patrick Hill in &quot;The Thrills Have Gone&quot;. Trouser Press reviewer Jason Reeher wrote that A3&#x27;s &quot;debut is brilliant and shambolic...owing huge debts to both Hank Williams and Happy Mondays&quot;.

Order: PterocliformesFamily: Pteroclidae

Sandgrouse have small, pigeon-like heads and necks and sturdy compact bodies. The adults are sexually dimorphic with the males being slightly larger and more brightly coloured than the females. They have eleven strong primary feathers and long pointed wings giving them a fast direct flight. The muscles of the wings are powerful and the birds are capable of rapid take off and sustained flight. There is a dense layer of under down which helps insulate the bird from extremes of heat and cold. The feathers of the belly are specially adapted for absorbing water and retaining it, allowing adults, particularly males, to carry water to chicks that may be many miles away from watering holes.

* Pin-tailed sandgrouse, &quot;Pterocles alchata&quot; (Ex)
* Black-bellied sandgrouse, &quot;Pterocles orientalis&quot; (Ex)

==Bustards==
Order: OtidiformesFamily: Otididae

Bustards are large terrestrial birds mainly associated with dry open country and steppes in the Old World. They are omnivorous and nest on the ground.

* Common cuckoo, &quot;Cuculus canorus&quot;

==Nightjars and allies==
Order: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Caprimulgidae

Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is cryptically coloured to resemble bark or leaves.

* Eurasian nightjar, &quot;Caprimulgus europaeus&quot;

==Swifts==
Order: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Apodidae

The swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang.

* Alpine swift, &quot;Apus melba&quot;
* Common swift, &quot;Apus apus&quot;
* Pallid swift, &quot;Apus pallidus&quot;

==Rails, gallinules and coots==
Order: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae
Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.

* Water rail, &quot;Rallus aquaticus&quot; 
* Corn crake, &quot;Crex crex&quot; (A)
* Spotted crake, &quot;Porzana porzana&quot;

* Baillon&#x27;s crake, &quot;Zapornia pusilla&quot; (A)

==Cranes==
Order: GruiformesFamily: Gruidae

Cranes are large, long-legged and long-necked birds. Unlike the similar-looking but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Most have elaborate and noisy courting displays or &quot;dances&quot;.

* Demoiselle crane, &quot;Anthropoides virgo&quot; 
* Common crane, &quot;Grus grus&quot;

==Thick-knees==
Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Burhinidae

The thick-knees are a group of largely tropical waders in the family Burhinidae. They are found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large waders with strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes and cryptic plumage. Despite being classed as waders, most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats.

* Eurasian oystercatcher, &quot;Haematopus ostralegus&quot;

==Plovers and lapwings==
Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Charadriidae
The family Charadriidae includes the plovers, dotterels and lapwings. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water.

<text>USS &quot;Tucson&quot; (CL-98/CLAA-98) was a modified light cruiser, sometimes referred to as an &quot;&quot;Oakland&quot;-class&quot;. She was laid down on 23 December 1942 in San Francisco, California, by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation; launched on 3 September 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Emmett S. Claunch, Sr.; and commissioned on 3 February 1945. She was named after Tucson, Arizona. She, along with the surviving &quot;Atlanta&quot;-class, was reclassified a light antiaircraft cruiser (CLAA) on 18 March 1949, prior to her decommissioning on 18 June 1949.

==Service history==
===World War II===
Following outfitting at San Francisco and shakedown out of San Diego, &quot;Tucson&quot; sailed for the western Pacific on 8 May. She stopped at Pearl Harbor on 13 May for three weeks of additional training before resuming her voyage west on 2 June. She stopped overnight at Ulithi on 13 June and 14 June, then continued on to the Philippines, and reached Leyte on 16 June. The cruiser was assigned to the screen of the Task Force 38 (TF 38), specifically to that of Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan&#x27;s Task Group 38.3 (TG 38.3) built around , , , , and .

&quot;Tucson&quot; joined the fast carriers just in time to participate in their final rampage against the Japanese Empire and its inner defenses. On 1 July, she sortied from Leyte Gulf with TF 38 and headed north to the Japanese home islands. On 10 July, the flattops launched planes against Tokyo. On 14–15 July, TF 38&#x27;s air groups struck Hokkaidō and northern Honshū. They returned to southern Honshū on 17–18 July to blast Tokyo again and then left the area for almost a week. On 24 July and 28 July, she appeared with the carriers south of Shikoku while their planes hit shipping in the Inland Sea. On 30 July, they zeroed in on Kobe and Nagoya. After that, they retired south to fuel and replenish before striking out northward. By the second week of August, &quot;Tucson&quot; was off northern Honshū screening the carriers while their planes pounded the island once more. She then accompanied them south to pummel Tokyo again on 13 August. Two days later, Japan capitulated.

===Post-war service===
Though hostilities had ceased in mid-August and the Japanese had surrendered formally on 2 September, &quot;Tucson&quot; remained in the Far East, steaming with TF 38 to the east of Honshū, covering the occupation forces moving into Japan. On 20 September, she cleared area and, two days later, stopped at Okinawa before shaping a course back to the United States. En route, she called at Pearl Harbor and then arrived in San Francisco on 5 October. On 23 October, the warship headed down the coast to San Pedro, where she participated in the Navy Day celebration on 27–28 October. On 29 October, she shifted to San Diego where she reported for duty with Pacific Fleet Training Command as an antiaircraft gunnery training ship. Between November 1945 and August 1946, the antiaircraft cruiser trained about 5,000 officers and men in the use of 5 in (127 mm), 40 mm, and 20 mm anti-aircraft guns. She interrupted her training duties periodically to represent the Navy at special events held in various ports on the Pacific coast.

On 6 September, she entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for a three-month overhaul to get ready for duty under the Commander, Destroyers, Pacific Fleet. For the next two months, &quot;Tucson&quot; trained out of San Diego in preparation for a fleet exercise to be conducted near Hawaii. On 24 February 1947, the cruiser stood out of San Diego and cruised Hawaiian waters as an element of the force charged with the defense of the islands against an aggressor force moving in from the western Pacific. At the completion of the exercise, the warship put into Pearl Harbor on 11 March. However, she got underway again on 18 March to participate in the fruitless search to the northwest of Hawaii for survivors of the wrecked SS &quot;Fort Dearborn&quot;.

On 27 March, &quot;Tucson&quot; returned to San Diego and resumed normal west coast operations until late summer. She again departed the west coast on 28 July and proceeded, via Pearl Harbor, to the Far East, arriving at Yokosuka, Japan, on 15 August. For the next two months, the warship cruised the waters of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea making observations during the Communist-Nationalist struggle for supremacy in Manchuria and northern China. During that period, she visited Shanghai twice and Tsingtao once. &quot;Tucson&quot; returned to Yokosuka on 19 October, stayed overnight, and sailed the next day for the United States, arriving at San Diego on 6 November. The cruiser resumed west coast operations and, for the brief remainder of her active career, remained so engaged.

On 9 February 1949, &quot;Tucson&quot; reported to Mare Island Naval Shipyard to begin preparations for inactivation. Like the other &quot;Atlanta&quot;-class cruisers, &quot;Tucson&quot; was reclassified as a light antiaircraft cruiser (CLAA) on 18 March 1949. On 11 June 1949, she was decommissioned and berthed with the San Francisco Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She remained in reserve at Mare Island until 1 June 1966 when her name was struck from the Navy list. The former warship served as a test hulk until 1970. On 24 February 1971, the hulk was sold to the National Metal &amp; Steel Corp., of Terminal Island, California, for scrapping.

==Legacy==
The base of one of the rotating gun turrets was later surplussed to be used as the rotating mount of a giant Van de Graaf particle accelerator at the physics department of the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. The beam line shot out by the accelerator was steered by rotating the entire accelerator assembly mounted on the turret base. It remained in use until the accelerator was decommissioned around 2005. The fact that a turret base of &quot;Tucson&quot; was surplussed to be used in Tucson, AZ is apparently a pure coincidence.

==Awards==
&quot;Tucson&quot; earned one battle star during World War II.

<text>Kearney Nick Jones, better known by his stage name Nick 13, is the lead vocalist, guitarist and main songwriter of psychobilly band Tiger Army, as well as a solo artist in the alternative country genre.

==Career==

===Tiger Army===

Tiger Army was signed to Hellcat Records in 1996 shortly after forming and released their self-titled full-length debut album in October 1999. That album was followed by 2001&#x27;s &quot;Tiger Army II: Power of Moonlite&quot;, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Tiger Army III: Ghost Tigers Rise&quot; and 2007&#x27;s &quot;Music from Regions Beyond&quot; before leaving the label. Their latest album, &quot;V •••–&quot;, was released in 2016 on Luna Tone Records/Rise Records.

===Solo career===
In an interview, Nick 13 was asked why the sole songwriter for a band would launch a solo career. &quot;The first person to give me the idea of a primary songwriter making a solo record was Paul Fenech of The Meteors,&quot; he said. &quot;I always thought there was something cool about that: You write all the songs for the band, and there&#x27;s a certain sound people expect. But while Tiger Army has always tested those kinds of boundaries, there are certain things that relate to heaviness and aggression that aren&#x27;t part of my solo project, at all.&quot; When asked about the status of Tiger Army, he said, &quot;Tiger Army aren&#x27;t going anywhere—we will be back.&quot; 

His first full performance as a solo artist was at the Stagecoach Festival in Indio, California, in spring, 2010, where he opened for Merle Haggard and Ray Price. A handful of small club dates in California followed, leading up to an appearance at the Hootenanny Festival in Orange County just before Chuck Berry. Press reviews for both festival events were favorable.

Nick revealed in an interview with &quot;No Depression&quot; that he had recorded with a wide-ranging group of notable musicians including Greg Leisz, Eddie Perez, Lloyd Green, Joshua Grange, and Mitch Marine. According to Nick&#x27;s official Twitter page updates, album work continued as of December 2010. The album was co-produced by Greg Leisz and James Intveld.

Following Nick&#x27;s performance at South By Southwest, Sugar Hill Records announced that they would be releasing Nick&#x27;s debut solo album on June 7, 2011. He kicked off touring in support of the album with two nights at The Troubadour in West Hollywood, followed by national touring through October 2011.

The album has been very well received by the Americana press. Nick&#x27;s road support of the album included an appearance at Austin City Limits Music Festival. Nick made several appearance&#x27;s on Nashville&#x27;s WSM Radio in November 2011, including a performance at Americana Carnival. Great American Country added the video for &quot;All Alone&quot; to their &quot;Out of the Box&quot; program in December 2011 and has continued to air it throughout 2012. In January 2012, Nick appeared at the NAMM Show where he performed and met with fans at the booth operated by Gretsch, his guitar endorser. In the summer of 2012, Nick headlined two nights at the El Rey Theatre in Hollywood and released a music video for &quot;Carry My Body Down.&quot;

The video for &quot;Carry My Body Down&quot; began airing on Great American Country&#x27;s &quot;Out of the Box&quot; program and on Country Music Television in late summer, 2012. The video reached No. 1 on CMT Pure&#x27;s &quot;12-Pack Countdown&quot; in November 2012. Nick appeared at the 2013 Stagecoach Festival with Dwight Yoakam, Marty Stuart and more, broadcast on AXS TV. The video for &quot;Nighttime Sky&quot; arrived around the same time, eventually debuting at No. 1 on CMT Pure&#x27;s &quot;12-Pack Countdown&quot; and staying there for 6 consecutive weeks. Nick tweeted plans to shoot and direct a fourth video himself, for the track &quot;In the Orchard.&quot; This video was released in July 2014.

According to his official Twitter account, Nick intends to write and record a second solo album before creating a new Tiger Army album. Nick 13 is a practitioner of Transcendental Meditation.

Nick has stated that he does not mix politics with music, but has criticized George W. Bush and the religious right.

<text>Jean Calas (1698 – 10 March 1762) was a merchant living in Toulouse, France, who was tried, judicially tortured, and executed for the murder of his son, despite his protestations of innocence. Calas was a Protestant in an officially Catholic society. Doubts about his guilt were raised by opponents of the Catholic Church and he was exonerated in 1764. In France, he became a symbolic victim of religious intolerance, along with François-Jean de la Barre and Pierre-Paul Sirven.
==Life==
===Background===
Calas, along with his wife, was a Protestant. France was then a Catholic country; Catholicism was the state religion, with no legal right for individuals to practice different faiths. While the harsh oppression of Protestantism initiated by King Louis XIV had largely receded, Protestants were, at best, tolerated. Louis, one of Calas&#x27;s sons, converted to Catholicism in 1756.
===Death of Marc-Antoine Calas===

On 13–14 October 1761, another of the Calas sons, Marc-Antoine, was found dead on the ground floor of the family&#x27;s home. Rumors had it that Jean Calas had killed his son because he intended to convert to Catholicism. When interrogated, the family initially claimed that Marc-Antoine had been killed by a murderer. Then they declared that they had found Marc-Antoine dead, hanged; because suicide was considered a heinous crime against oneself, and the dead bodies of suicides were defiled, they had arranged for their son&#x27;s suicide to look like a murder.
===Trial and execution===

Despite Jean Calas&#x27;s claiming that his son died by suicide, and the testimony of Jeanne Viguière, Calas&#x27;s Catholic governess, the &quot;parlement&quot; (regional court) of Toulouse held that Jean Calas had murdered his son. And on 9 March 1762, the court sentenced him to be broken on the wheel -- judicially executed.

The same sentence subjected Calas to death by torture. The government stretched his arms and legs until they were pulled out of their sockets. of water was poured down his throat. He was tied to a cross in the cathedral square, on which each of his limbs was broken twice by an iron bar. Yet even under this torture, Calas continued to declare his innocence. On 10 March, at the age of 64, Jean Calas died on the wheel, while still firmly declaring his innocence.
===Posthumous exoneration===

French philosopher Voltaire was contacted about the case, and after initial suspicions that Calas was guilty of anti-Catholic fanaticism were dispelled by his investigations, he began a campaign to get Calas&#x27;s sentence overturned, claiming that Marc-Antoine had committed suicide because of gambling debts and not being able to finish his university studies due to his denomination.

Voltaire&#x27;s efforts were successful, and King Louis XV received the family and had the sentence annulled in 1764. The king fired the chief magistrate of Toulouse, the Capitoul, the trial was done over, and in 1765 Jean Calas posthumously was exonerated on a &quot;&quot;, not on the original charges, with the family paid 36,000 livres by the king in compensation. Voltaire, an outspoken critic of the Catholic church, cited the instance as an example of the church&#x27;s severity in his 1763 work &quot;Treatise on Tolerance&quot;.

<doc id="614283" wikidata="Q1187838" url="?curid=614283" title="USS John Paul Jones (DDG-53)">
<text>USS &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; (DDG-53) is the third (Flight I) Aegis guided missile destroyer. in the United States Navy and the first ship of the class homeported on the west coast. She is the fifth ship named after American Revolutionary War naval captain John Paul Jones and the second to carry his first name. She was built at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. The ship is part of Destroyer Squadron 9 of Carrier Strike Group 11, which is headed by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier . 

== Description ==
&quot;John Paul Jones&quot; is capable of operating independently, as an element of a coordinated force, or as the nucleus of a surface action group, and to direct and coordinate anti-air, surface, undersea, and strike warfare operations. The ship is equipped with the Aegis combat system and is capable of conducting both offensive and defensive operations using Tomahawk cruise missiles, RGM-84 Harpoon and RIM-66 Standard missiles, CIWS, and the gun. The &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class is the first class of U.S. warships to be fitted with an integrated chemical, biological and radiological defense system.

The ship is named in honor of John Paul Jones and derives her motto from his words: &quot;I wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast, for I intend to go in harm&#x27;s way.&quot;

==Service history ==
Construction of &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; began on 8 August 1990, at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. The ship was christened and launched on 26 October 1991.

&quot;John Paul Jones&quot; was selected as the Shock Trial platform for the DDG-51 class. The ship was subjected to a series of close range explosions in order for the Navy to obtain critical information concerning the survivability of the DDG-51 class in a shock environment. The crew prepared the ship for the most demanding and complex surface ship shock trial test in the history of the Navy. The ship has completed four deployments to the Persian Gulf.

On 7 October 2001, &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; launched the first Tomahawk missiles into Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

In June 2010, she began a ten-month yard period during which her machinery control system and many hull mechanical and electrical systems (HM&amp;E) systems were upgraded. This was a first in class effort, similar to the CG-47 mid life upgrade undertaken on the hull.

On 10 June 2011, she anchored off the coast of Malibu, California, at the beginning of a three-day celebration called Navy Days designed to thank the sailors and their families for their service to the country. On 29 November 2011, &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; was the first ship to deploy after receiving the DDGMOD (HM&amp;E) upgrade.

On 1 November 2015, &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; participated in &quot;Campaign Fierce Sentry&quot; Flight Test Operational-02 Event 2 (FTO-02 E2), a complex $230 million U.S. military missile defense system test event conducted at Wake Island and the surrounding ocean areas. During the test, the destroyer shot down a simulated anti-ship cruise missile but failed to intercept a medium-range ballistic missile that was launched from a C-17 transport plane.

On 18 January 2016, &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; sank the decommissioned guided-missile frigate in a test of a new anti-surface warfare variant of the Raytheon Standard Missile 6 (SM-6), becoming the first ship to sink a ship with the new variant of the missile. &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; fired the missile on the U.S. Pacific Missile Range near Hawaii.

On 3 February 2017, &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; completed a ballistic missile intercept in a test off the west coast of Hawaii. The test marks the first time that a ballistic missile has been targeted using the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA interceptor.

==In popular culture==
The ship was featured prominently in the 2012 film &quot;Battleship&quot;. After the sinking of two other destroyers, including sister ship , she fought alone against the hostile alien fleet. She was later sunk in combat due to severe damage after being specifically targeted by the alien mothership because of the damage she had done to their fleet.

In written fiction, &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; appeared in &quot;2034: A Novel of the Next World War&quot; by Elliot Ackerman and James G. Stavridis, where the ship is ambushed and nearly sunk by the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy in the South China Sea. The ship also appeared in Tom Clancy&#x27;s &quot;Executive Orders&quot;.

<text>Sam&#x27;s West, Inc. (doing business as Sam&#x27;s Club) is a chain of membership-only warehouse club retail stores in the United States owned by Walmart. It was founded in 1983 and named after Walmart founder Sam Walton as Sam&#x27;s Wholesale Club. , Sam&#x27;s Club ranks second in sales volume among warehouse clubs with $84.3 billion in sales (in fiscal year 2023), behind its main rivals BJ&#x27;s Wholesale Club and Costco. 

, Sam&#x27;s Club operates 599 membership warehouse clubs in the United States across 45 states and Puerto Rico, with no locations in Alaska, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington State. Sam&#x27;s Club offers car wash services at gas stations in 41 locations.

Sam&#x27;s Club also operates 168 locations in Mexico and 45 locations in China. Grupo Big, formerly Walmart Brazil, which was de-consolidated from Walmart in August 2018 and now a part of carrefour group, also operates about 50 Sam&#x27;s Club locations in Brazil. Locations generally range in size from , with an average club size of approximately . Sam&#x27;s Club formerly had six locations in Canada from 2006 to 2009.

On January 11, 2018, Sam&#x27;s Club announced the permanent closure of select stores. In a number of cases, employees showed up to work and found the doors locked and a notice saying that the store would soon be liquidated. Walmart eventually told &quot;Business Insider&quot; that 63 Sam&#x27;s Club stores would begin liquidating across the country, including in Alaska, Arizona, California, Illinois, New York, Ohio, and Texas.

According to &quot;Business Insider&quot;, the closure of Sam&#x27;s Club locations and plans to convert some stores into e-commerce fulfillment centers as announced in January 2018 are part of Walmart&#x27;s growing commitment to online retailing that will allow it to better compete with rival Amazon.

==History==


Sam Walton opened the first Sam&#x27;s Wholesale Club on April 7, 1983, in Midwest City, Oklahoma, 21 years after he founded Walmart.

In 1987, Wal-Mart Stores purchased West Monroe, Louisiana-based SuperSaver Wholesale Warehouse Club; the purchase expanded the Sam&#x27;s Wholesale Club chain by 24 locations. Prior to the acquisition, the stores were owned by Alton Hardy Howard and his son John.

In 1989, Sam&#x27;s Wholesale Club opened its first club in New Jersey in a former Two Guys/Jefferson Ward store located in Delran. This was Walmart&#x27;s first expansion into the Northeast. The first Walmart discount store (now expanded into a Supercenter) in New Jersey opened in 1991 in Turnersville. 

In 1990, Sam&#x27;s Wholesale Club was renamed Sam&#x27;s Club, dropping off &quot;Wholesale&quot;. The same year, the first Sam&#x27;s Club opened in Pennsylvania.

In 1993, Walmart acquired PACE Membership Warehouse from K-mart and converted a majority of PACE locations into Sam&#x27;s Club stores.

Sam&#x27;s Club entered the Canadian market in Southern Ontario (all but one in the Greater Toronto Area/Golden Horseshoe) in 2003.

The latest flagship club opening , was in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The largest Sam&#x27;s Club store is located in Pineville, North Carolina, with of retail space that was formerly an Incredible Universe.

On September 24, 2006, Sam&#x27;s Club unveiled a new logo with an updated serif font.

In December 2007, Sam&#x27;s Club launched a new slogan, &quot;Enjoy the Possibilities&quot;. Since then, it became an official advertising slogan, mentioned in television and radio advertisements; however, it was not mentioned on its website. , the &quot;Enjoy the Possibilities&quot; slogan was no longer in use. Sam&#x27;s Club launched their latest slogan &quot;Savings Made Simple&quot; in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Starting in April 2007, there was speculation of a possible sale or spinoff of Sam&#x27;s Club from parent company Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. At Walmart&#x27;s 2007 annual shareholder&#x27;s meeting in June, management said that Sam&#x27;s Club is not for sale, although they did not say they are not considering a spinoff.

On February 26, 2009, Walmart Canada announced that it would be closing all six of its Canadian Sam&#x27;s Club locations. This was part of Walmart Canada&#x27;s decision to shift focus towards supercentres, but some industry observers suggested that the operation was struggling in competition with Costco and the non-membership The Real Canadian Superstore (known as Maxi &amp; Cie in Quebec), that had a well-established history in the country. Sam&#x27;s Club also rebranded the two as yet unopened locations as new Walmart Supercentres. In January 2010, it was announced that ten clubs would be closing, including four in California. At the same time, Sam&#x27;s opened six new clubs at various locations in the United States.

On January 24, 2010, it was announced that approximately 11,200 Sam&#x27;s Club employees would be laid off. The layoffs resulted from the decision to outsource product sampling duties to an outside company (Rogers, Arkansas-based Shopper Events, which already performs in-store product demonstrations for Walmart) and to eliminate New Business Membership Representative positions throughout the chain. Most of the laid-off employees were part-time and represented about 10% of the total Sam&#x27;s Club workforce.

Rosalind Brewer was named as the new CEO for Sam&#x27;s Club, a change that came into effect on February 1, 2012.

On January 24, 2014, it was announced that Walmart will cut 2,300 jobs at the underperforming Sam&#x27;s Club locations.

In 2016, Sam&#x27;s Club rolled out a mobile application that allows users to scan items while they shop and pay for them, skipping the checkout line. By December 2016, the app could be used at all locations in the United States. In 2019, the dedicated scanning app was deprecated, and its features were incorporated into the main Sam&#x27;s Club app.

On February 1, 2017, John Furner replaced Brewer as CEO of Sam&#x27;s Club.

On January 11, 2018, Walmart announced that 63 Sam&#x27;s Club locations in cities including Memphis, Houston, Seattle, and others would be closing. Some of the stores had already liquidated, without notifying employees, some employees learned by a company-wide email delivered January 11. All of the 63 stores were gone from the Sam&#x27;s Club website as of the morning of January 11, 2018. Walmart said that ten of the stores will become e-commerce distribution centers and employees can reapply to work at those locations. &quot;Business Insider&quot; magazine calculated that over 11,000 workers will be affected. On the same day, Walmart announced that as a result of the new tax law, it would be raising Walmart starting wages, distributing bonuses, expanding its leave policies and contributing toward the cost of employees&#x27; adoptions. Doug McMillon, Walmart&#x27;s CEO, said, &quot;We are early in the stages of assessing the opportunities tax reform creates for us to invest in our customers and associates and to further strengthen our business, all of which should benefit our shareholders.&quot;

On November 15, 2019, Kathryn McLay succeeded Furner as CEO of Sam&#x27;s Club. McClay announced plans in 2023 for the company to build 30 stores. She became CEO of Walmart International in 2023 and was succeeded as Sam&#x27;s Club CEO by Christopher Nicholas.

As of January 2024, Sam&#x27;s Club used an artificial intelligence-based receipt-checking technology at 10 stores that required customers to move through a portal to verify purchases. The company announced plans to put the technology in all of its stores by the end of 2024.

==Design==
Like other warehouse clubs, Sam&#x27;s Club sells most of its merchandise in bulk and directly off pallets. The clubs are arranged like warehouses, with merchandise stocked in steel bins. Products sold include jewelry, designer goods, sunglasses, crystal, and collectibles, electronics, floral, apparel, food, and meats. Most locations have Pharmacy, Tire and Battery, Photo (as of late 2019, photo was cut from most clubs), Bakery, Optical, Café, and Floral departments. 

Sam&#x27;s Club consolidated its private labels under the Member&#x27;s Mark brand in 2017. Sam&#x27;s Club does not sell the Sam&#x27;s Choice or Great Value brands that are available in Walmart stores.

==Sam&#x27;s Business Center==
Sam&#x27;s Club opened their first Business Center in Houston, Texas, in August 2008. Converted from an existing Sam&#x27;s location, the Business Center is similar in concept to Costco&#x27;s Business Centers.

In January 2010, the company announced it would be closing its Business Center, along with nine other clubs across the United States.

==Other retail formats==
In Houston, Sam&#x27;s Club opened Más Club in August 2009, a club geared towards the Hispanic population. Membership in Más Club was separate from membership in Sam&#x27;s Club. The store eventually began a liquidation sale in December 2013, and was closed in February 2014.

In October 2018, Sam&#x27;s Club opened Sam&#x27;s Club Now, a &quot;mobile-first&quot; retail store where customers use the Sam&#x27;s Club Now mobile app to scan and pay for merchandise. Customers can also order items ahead of time with same-day curbside pickup at the store. The Sam&#x27;s Club Now store is located in Dallas, TX.

==Controversy / Incidents==
In March 2020, a Sam&#x27;s Club store in Midland, Texas was the site of a violent stabbing that wounded three Asian family members, including two young children. The suspect, a 19-year-old, allegedly believed the Chinese were responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2021, Sam&#x27;s Club faced a boycott from some Chinese consumers due to taking Xinjiang-produced goods off the shelves. A number of Chinese consumers cancelled or suspended their membership cards.

<doc id="614285" wikidata="Q5095517" url="?curid=614285" title="Chicago Bruisers">
<text>The Chicago Bruisers were a professional arena football team based in Rosemont, Illinois. They were founded in 1987 as a charter member of the Arena Football League (AFL). They played their home games at Rosemont Horizon.

==History==
===Founding (1987)===

The Bruisers were an outgrowth of the Chicago Politicians, a team put together by Jim Foster to play an exhibition game to prove the feasibility of the sport the previous year. The team logo depicted a bulldog. One of the founders of the Bruisers was former Chicago Bears linebacker and WSCR host Doug Buffone.

The Bruisers were part of the 1987 &quot;Showcase Game&quot;, losing to the Miami Vise by a score of 33–30.

The Bruisers took a chance with a young team that averaged 25 years of age. The Bruisers&#x27; lost their first game in franchise history, 44–52 in overtime, to the Denver Dynamite. The Bruisers struggled in their second game, giving up 45 points in the first half before losing 23–60 to the Pittsburgh Gladiators. Despite getting off to a 2–3 start, the Bruisers had an opportunity to make it to ArenaBowl I with a win in the final week of the season against the Dynamite. The Bruisers however would lose 35–52. They finished with a record of 2–4 and failed to qualify for the playoffs.

The Bruisers&#x27; play-by-play announcer on radio and TV for all three of their seasons was Les Grobstein and their color commentator was Chicago Bears tight end Emery Moorehead.

===Moss and ArenaBowl II (1988)===

The Bruisers, like the Pittsburgh Gladiators but unlike the other two charter teams, the Denver Dynamite and the Washington Commandos, returned to play in the 1988 season. In February, the team hired Perry Moss as the franchise&#x27;s second coach. Moss also served as general manager. The team competed in ArenaBowl II that year, losing 24–13 to the Detroit Drive.

===End of the Bruisers (1989)===

The Bruisers would be disbanded after competing in the 1989 season. The final two games they played were in exhibition games overseas against the Detroit Drive in Paris and then London in October 1989.

The rights to the Bruisers name and history were purchased by Arena Football 1 in December 2009, along with the rest of the Arena Football League. There was a possibility that the AF1&#x27;s new expansion team in Chicago would adopt the Bruisers name, but said team instead decided to adopt the identity of the Chicago Rush instead. Since the Rush and the Bruisers never played at the same time, it was conceivable that the new Rush would adopt the history of both the old Rush and the Bruisers.

===2011 Honors===
In 2011, the Chicago Rush celebrated its 10th season in the Arena Football League and honored the Chicago Bruisers.

In the Rush home opener on March 18, 2011 against the Philadelphia Soul, Chicago wore black uniforms similar to the Bruisers with a patch featuring the original Bruiser Bulldog. In the game, Chicago won the game 62–28. The Rush also adopted a real bulldog from a local Chicago pound that can be seen during games around the arena. Starting during the 2011 season, the Chicago Rush began wearing black uniforms more often over their traditional navy home jerseys the team has worn from 2001 to 2010 to honor the Bruisers.

<doc id="614289" wikidata="Q7827476" url="?curid=614289" title="Tory Action">
<text>Tory Action was a right-wing pressure group within the British Conservative Party, founded in November 1974 by George Kennedy Young and Airey Neave and right-wing defectors from the Monday Club.

==Activities==

It was a secretive outfit in which membership was only open to Conservative Party members of two or more years standing, although their &#x27;Aims&#x27; simply say &quot;paid-up members&quot;. Its published &#x27;Aims&#x27; state that &quot;we do not have a corporate creed and our membership holds a variety of views but most feel strongly on sound public finance, on the need for denationalisation, European Union reform, law and order, combatting subversion, halting the growth of the non-European population in the UK, and a repatriation programme.&quot;

It published a newsletter entitled &quot;The Round Robin&quot;.

The group claimed to have a &quot;country-wide network of Conservative office-holders and activists&quot; and claimed credit for canvassing for Margaret Thatcher in her constituency for the 1979 General Election. In 1981, George Young claimed it had the support of at least 25 Conservative MPs, including Ronald Bell who had hosted a Tory Action reception in the House of Commons in December 1980.

By 1990, the Tory Action Committee consisted of (Chairman) ?, Adrian Davies, Stephen Derry, Geoffrey W Bevan, Michael R Wheddon.

The group ceased activities in the early 1990s.

<doc id="614291" wikidata="Q54371" url="?curid=614291" title="Line 2 Bloor–Danforth">
<text>Line 2 Bloor–Danforth is a rapid transit line in the Toronto subway system, operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). It has 31 stations and is in length. It opened on February 26, 1966, and extensions at both ends were completed in 1968 and again in 1980.

The line runs primarily a few metres north of Bloor Street from its western terminus at Kipling Avenue with a direct connection to the Kipling GO Station to the Prince Edward Viaduct east of Castle Frank Road, after which the street continues as Danforth Avenue and the line continues running a few metres north of Danforth Avenue until just east of Main Street, where it bends northeasterly and runs above-grade until just east of Warden station, where it continues underground to its eastern terminus, slightly east of Kennedy Road on Eglinton Avenue, which has a direct connection to the Kennedy GO Station. The subway line is closed nightly for maintenance, during which Blue Night Network bus routes provide service along the route.

The most travelled part of the line is located in Toronto&#x27;s midtown area known as Yorkville. In this area, the subway connects to Line 1 Yonge–University at , and Bloor–Yonge stations. Towards the east, where the line runs parallel to Danforth Avenue, it serves areas such as Greektown (also known as &quot;the Danforth&quot;) and the East Danforth neighbourhood. It then runs through a very short stretch of East York to its eastern terminus in Scarborough, where it connected to the former Line 3 Scarborough. To the west of Yorkville, the line continues along Bloor Street serving many communities such as the Annex, Koreatown, Bloorcourt Village, Bloordale Village, Junction Triangle, Bloor West Village, a very short stretch in York, and the Kingsway and Islington–Etobicoke City Centre areas in Etobicoke, where it terminates at Kipling Avenue in Six Points.

Construction of an extension to Sheppard Avenue and McCowan Road to replace Line 3 Scarborough began on June 23, 2021. This project has no confirmed completion date.

==Name==
When the Bloor–Danforth line, the second subway line in the city, opened in 1966, it necessitated renaming the first subway line &quot;the Yonge line&quot;. Unofficially, the subway lines were already numbered, but in October 2013, the TTC announced plans to give the lines an official number to help riders and visitors to navigate the system. The new signage reflecting this change began being installed in March 2014, with and being the first two stations updated. The subway was formerly internally known as route 601. Since the mid-2010s, it is publicly referred to as &quot;Line 2 Bloor–Danforth&quot;.

==History==

===Pre-subway era===

The earliest mention of rapid transit along the Bloor–Danforth line&#x27;s route was made in a 1910 report that was prepared by an American firm of transit consultants. This study had been commissioned by a special commission, which included City Controller Horatio Clarence Hocken and Mayor of Toronto Joseph Oliver. In their final report, the consultants suggested that the Prince Edward Viaduct, which spans the Don River Valley, should include a lower deck for a future subway. The lower deck was built, but the first plan for a line to use it was not made until June 15, 1933, when the TTC published a report which suggested construction of a subway and an expressway broadly following Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue. The estimated cost of the project was , but the plan was not implemented. Plans for a somewhat longer route, running east to west from Victoria Park Avenue to the Humber River, were proposed by the Toronto Planning Board in December 1943, although the report did not include costings. During the fall of 1911, the City of Toronto put out a tender for the construction of concrete tubes to carry a subway. However, when the cost of the subway was put to a referendum, the construction of the subway tunnels was rejected.

Before the subway was built, the Bloor streetcar line operated along the route between Jane Street and Luttrell Avenue (located just west of Shoppers World Danforth). Paired PCC streetcars or multiple units (MUs) operated from 1950 to the opening of the subway line in 1966. The TTC favoured this route because the Prince Edward Viaduct made it easier to build a subway across the Don Valley, and the streetcar that ran along the route was filled with passengers travelling from East York and Scarborough. To provide relief to this streetcar line and to ease expansion into the suburbs, the line was built a few metres north of both Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue.

===Subway construction===

During the period after World War II, rapid development created a need for more public transit. A referendum on whether a subway should be constructed along Yonge Street was held on January 1, 1946, and this proposal received majority support. The opening of the Yonge subway in 1954 resulted in another plan by the TTC for a Bloor–Danforth line, this time without an expressway, costing $146million. The line was approved, but was not built.

In the 1950s, there was intense debate over where the second Toronto subway line would run as it would affect how bus routes in Toronto&#x27;s suburbs would operate. There were two main plans. While both shared the same route at the outer ends, the TTC favoured a route that continued eastwards from Christie station to Pape station. This plan was championed by the TTC chairman, Allan Lamport, and also included an extension of the Yonge line from Union station northwards to meet the new line at St. George station. The other plan, which was proposed by the city&#x27;s planning department and endorsed by the Metro Toronto chairman, Fred Gardiner, had a large U-shaped diversion in the centre. From Christie station, it ran south to Queen Street West, and after following Queen Street eastwards to Pape Avenue, turned north to rejoin the east–west route at Pape station. The eastern routing is similar to the Relief Line subway proposal of the 2010s and its successor, the Ontario Line.

In 1956, Toronto&#x27;s midtown area was starting to experience growth. There was a public debate about the two schemes between the two chairmen and the municipalities that made up Metropolitan Toronto. The extension of the Yonge line along University Avenue, and the east–west Bloor–Danforth line extension were authorized on September 5, 1958 by the Ontario Municipal Board which sought a compromise between the involved communities. The financing of the project was controversial. For the first time, financing was to be split between the TTC and Metro Toronto, incurring a property tax increase. This was opposed by Etobicoke, Long Branch, Mimico, New Toronto and Scarborough, who wanted the project to be funded solely by the TTC. The battle to stop the project went to the Supreme Court of Canada.

The University line opened in 1963, and the Bloor–Danforth line opened from Keele station in the west to Woodbine station in the east on February 26, 1966. Nine men died during its construction in several incidents. Most of the line was built underground using the cut-and-cover method, with some sections along University Avenue built using shield tunneling with manual excavation of the faceand even a short stretch using the Milan tunneling method ( the Icos–Veder method). Other parts of the line were built above ground in grade-separated rail corridors. The line was long, and ran about north of Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue. The cost of the initial section was $200million ($billion in dollars).

Once the line started full operation, construction of extensions to the Bloor–Danforth line began. The extensions to Islington station in the west and Warden station in the east opened simultaneously on May 11, 1968. These were completed at a cost of $77million ($million in dollars). On November 21, 1980, the line was extended to the current terminal stations of Kipling station in the west and Kennedy station in the east at a further cost of $110million ($million in dollars).

===Subway operations===

Upon opening, the Bloor–Danforth line was well received: a survey taken four months later showed that the subway was used by 10,000 riders per hour. As a result, many bus and streetcar routes were either discontinued or shortened. Various bus and streetcar routes that connected to the subway stations allowed the line to continue to grow and become more sustainable. The line carries an average of 503,060 passengers on weekdays during the 2015 operating year.

For the first six months of operation, the subway was operated as a single system, with trains from Eglinton station running through to either Keele or Woodbine station, while other trains connected the latter two points. However, the manoeuvre made operation of both lines more difficult, and the practice was abandoned after the initial trial period, leaving Lower Bay station abandoned.

In 1971, Metro Council insisted that the zone fare system be removed to allow residents of the suburbs to travel anywhere with a single fare. Prior to this, stations west of and east of were geographically part of Zone 2 for fare purposes, but the subway used a flat fare system, so they were treated as being part of Zone 1. This created problems when transferring from the subway to the buses, which were in different zones at the same location. The solution was a change in political thinking, where the subway was seen as a subsidized public service, instead of a utility that needed to balance its books.

On October 15, 1976, an arsonist lit a fire on a subway train at Christie station. The fire destroyed four subway cars and some wall tiles, and resulted in a section of the subway being closed for a few days. As a result, the middle section of Christie station has different-coloured trim tiles. On September 19, 2007, the station modernization program was started. This program would result in making the subway system more accessible, add new bus and streetcar platforms, and improve the connections to regional buses and GO trains.

== Stations ==

Kipling station, the western terminus of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth, is located near Kipling Avenue and Dundas Street West. After going east for , it meets the University segment of Line 1 at both and St. George stations. It also meets the Yonge Street line at Yonge station. The route&#x27;s eastern terminus is located at Kennedy station. The line does not run under Bloor Street or Danforth Avenue, except at the Prince Edward Viaduct; otherwise, it is offset to the north by about a city block. In some areas, it runs under parks and parking lots behind the businesses on the north side of the street, while other sections run under side streets.

Most stations on the Bloor–Danforth line have side platforms. At the surface, some stations are designed to be a part of a shopping area, which are located above the subway. Other stations are large facilities on the surface that also contain bus and/or streetcar platforms to allow transfers to take place.

===Designs===
The pre-1980 subway stations of the Bloor–Danforth line follow a two-colour background and trim theme and use the unique Toronto Subway typeface on the stations&#x27; walls. The tiling theme was influenced by SEPTA&#x27;s Broad Street Subway in Philadelphia and used a cycle that was similar to the design employed on the Yonge subway. This design consists of two colours for the tiles, one for main wall tiles and another for trim tiles near the ceiling of the stations. The station names on the main wall tiles use the colour of the trim tiles and vice versa, except that some of the station names of the trim tiles are white instead of the main wall tile colour for readability.

This pattern is based on a design similar to the stations along the University line, which follow a regular pattern with some small variances, which are the result of multiple events. One of these tiling variances is located at Christie station, where some of the original tiles were replaced following the 1976 arson attack. The replacement trim tiles were differently coloured due to the lack of extra green trim tiles.

Other variations to the pattern can be observed at Islington and Warden stations, as well as at the former bus bay of Victoria Park station, the three of which have a tricolour design. The current terminus stations of Kipling and Kennedy stations, upon initial opening in 1980, resemble the second version of Union subway station. When they opened, Kipling and Kennedy stations were the only Line 2 stations not to use the Toronto Subway typeface. However, in late 2017, Kipling station was redesigned to use the Toronto Subway typeface as well, leaving Kennedy station being the sole station on Line 2 not to use the typeface.

===Modernization program===

As the stations on the line have begun to show signs of aging, the TTC has initiated a station modernization program aimed at improving accessibility and appearances at several subway stations. These modernizations include new and updated wall finishes, signage, lighting and public art, as well as the installation of elevators for accessibility needs. and stations are the first slated for modernization under this project, and Islington will also be modernized under larger capital projects aimed at greater accessibility and reconstruction of bus loading platforms. Construction of a second access route at Broadview station was completed in 2007. This work provided direct access to bus platforms and a new streetcar platform, improving traffic control within the station. Victoria Park station&#x27;s modernization project was completed between 2008 and 2011 to make the station more functional, attractive, better connected to the surrounding community, and fully accessible.

The second exit program was also included in station modernization projects after a fire safety audit revealed several at-risk stations with only one means of access and egress from the subway platform level to the street. Some stations with only one entrance/exit received a second means of access/egress during major overhauls at stations such as Pape and Dufferin. Other stations such as and are scheduled to receive second exits for egress only. Due to the potential for land expropriation and construction of the exit structures in residential neighbourhoods, this portion of the program has become controversial, as some houses need to be removed to accommodate these secondary exits. Plans to add a second exit for Donlands, Greenwood, and Woodbine stations were deferred in late February 2011 due to lack of funding. In September 2017, the addition of elevators and a second exit and automatic entrance were completed at Woodbine station, rendering it fully accessible. As of July 2020, modernization work for Donlands station was planned to begin in the fourth quarter of 2020.

==Fare collection==

All types of TTC fares are accepted at staffed subway station entrances. Presto cards can be purchased and loaded with money or digital monthly TTC passes at automatic fare vending machines, which also sell Presto 1-ride, 2-ride or day pass tickets. Presto cards and tickets are accepted at all TTC subway station entrances.

On December 1, 2019, all subway station collector booths were permanently closed and replaced by roaming customer service attendants. While customers would still be able to pay their fares by senior or youth TTC tickets, tokens or day passes, these were no longer available for purchase at stations and no change will be given to customers who pay cash fares.

All Line 2 stations except Chester connect to surface TTC bus or streetcar routes during regular operating hours. Some connections require proof-of-payment. Valid proof-of-payment includes paper transfers – free supplementary tickets obtained at the point of entering the transit system that allow the rider to transfer to another route on a one-way continuous direction with no stopovers or backtracking permitted – and Presto cards, which provide unlimited two-hour transfers in any direction across the TTC network.

==Service==
===Frequency===
The frequency for this line is 2 to 3 minutes during peak periods and 4 to 5 minutes during off-peak periods.

The Route 300 Bloor–Danforth Blue Night Network bus provides late-night service to the area around the stations when the subway is not in operation. This service operates frequently along Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue between the East/West Mall and Kennedy station via Danforth Road, Brimley Road, Eglinton Avenue East, North/South Service Road, Transway Crescent and Kennedy Road. On Sundays, these routes operate through the early morning hours, because the subway starts service at 8:00 a.m. instead of the usual 6:00 a.m. Frequency is 6 to 30 minutes.

===Capacity===
As of 2016, Line 2 was running at capacity with almost 26,000 peak-hour riders. Upgraded signalling would allow for more frequent trains and expand peak-hour capacity to almost 33,000 riders by 2031.

==Rolling stock==

The first trains to operate on Line 2 were the M1-series subway trains, which were among the first subway trains to be manufactured in Canada. At the time of construction, these subway cars were the longest in the world. As a result of camshaft propulsion controls, the increased speed provided by the M-series trains and the H-series trains allowed the Bloor–Danforth line to operate efficiently between Islington and Warden without the need for a larger subway fleet. As a result, the G-series subway trains were exclusively confined to the Yonge–University line. In the 1980s, as the H-series trains took over, the M-series trains were only used during rush hour as the trains were linked to be made up of vehicles of a single class. With the introduction of the T1-series subway trains (which had been used exclusively on the Yonge–University–Spadina line during their first years of service in the late 1990s), the M1-series trains were retired from service between 1998 and 1999.

Due to the opening of the Bloor–Danforth line and the additional services that were required, a new set of trains were purchased from the Hawker Siddeley group. These trains, which were a part of the H series, were similar to the M1-series trains with newer features such as electrically operated doors. With the introduction of the T1-series subway trains, the H1 and H2 trains were retired from service, while the remaining H4 trains (along with some earlier T1 series trains) were shifted to the Bloor–Danforth line.

Following the introduction of the Toronto Rocket subway trains on the Yonge–University and Sheppard lines, all of the T1-series trains were transferred to the Bloor–Danforth line, where they replaced the remaining H4- and H6-series subway trains. The T1s are now the only trains operating on the line. The remaining H4 trains were retired from revenue service throughout the fall of 2011, and the last cars were decommissioned on January 27, 2012. They were the last version of TTC trains that were not equipped with air-conditioning systems (but instead used ceiling fans); they were also the last of which to be outfitted with larger orange upholstered bench seating and were mainly used on weekdays, most often during rush hour several years before their retirement. The H4s also had a similar interior design based on the H2 subway cars. The H6-series trains (which had bright orange doors and panels, individual seats, along with light brown floors, cream walls and brown simulated wood grain panels) were retired from service between 2013 and 2014; the final run for the last H6-series train took place on June 20, 2014. In mid-2016, a few Toronto Rocket trains were used on Line 2 because of an air conditioning malfunction in numerous individual T1 cars, combined with a hotter than average summer. This was after Toronto Mayor John Tory accepted a challenge posted on Twitter to ride an overheated T1 train on Line 2 during a hot summer day.

=== Replacing or refurbishing the T1 fleet ===
The TTC estimated that the T1 fleet&#x27;s useful life would end in 2026. In 2017, the TTC planned to replace the T1 fleet with 62 new trains, possibly using a successor of the Toronto Rocket type from Bombardier to eliminate the time needed to prototype a different model. However, in March 2019, the TTC reversed its decision and planned to delay the purchase of new train sets by refurbishing the T1 fleet to extend its life by a decade. The cost of refurbishment was estimated at $715million, versus $1.86billion required to replace the T1 fleet. Refurbishment would not include installing automatic train control (ATC) equipment on the T1 fleet, while new train sets would have included this feature, and this choice will thus delay the implementation of ATC on Line 2 by ten years. It was concurrently revealed the TTC lacked the facilities to store and maintain a new fleet at a new Kipling carhouse, which was originally planned to open in the mid-2020s, was now scheduled to open in 2031.

On August 6, 2020, the TTC issued a request for information (RFI) to gather information from potential suppliers to identify those who would be interested in designing and supplying new subway trains to the TTC. The RFI closed on September 18, 2020, and the TTC hosted an information session date on May 4, 2021, with potential suppliers to discuss the background, industry engagement, procurement model, and technical overview with interested manufacturers. The TTC later issued a request for proposal (RFP) on October 13, 2022, to the prequalified proponents to submit proposals for delivering the new trains. Prequalified rail vehicle manufacturers included Alstom Transport Canada, CRRC Qingdao Sifang, Hyundai Rotem, and Kawasaki Rail Car.

In July 2023, the TTC cancelled its request for proposals to supply new subway trains due to a lack of funding. Before the cancellation, the TTC had hoped to purchase 80 new trains, 55 for Line 2 to replace the T1 fleet and 25 for growth on Line 1 Yonge–University. The city pledged to pay one-third of the $2.5 billion estimated cost, but the provincial and federal governments had not committed to pay the remaining amount.

In November 2023, the province promised to contribute $758million for the purchase of 55 new subway trains to replace Line 2&#x27;s T1 fleet, provided that the federal government and the city each make a matching contribution. In November 2024, the federal government announced it would also contribute $758million. In total, the new fleet of 55 trains would cost $2.3billion. The TTC expects delivery of the new trains to start in 2030. The TTC has budgeted $163million to keep the old T1 fleet operational until it is fully replaced.

===Depot===

Most trains that serve the Bloor–Danforth line are stored at the Greenwood Yard, which opened with the first segment of the line. Before the yard was built, the land was occupied by a quarry and a garbage dump. Due to its location next to the Canadian National Railway (and GO Transit Lakeshore East and Stouffville line) tracks, it was possible for trains to be delivered directly to the subway. The CN rail tracks were converted to allow for the storage of more subway trains as the T1-series trains were shifted from Yonge–University–Spadina line to the Bloor–Danforth line. In addition to providing storage for subway trains, the Greenwood Yard was also used to maintain vehicles that operated on Line 3 Scarborough during the line&#x27;s operation from 1985 to 2023, as the McCowan Yard was only equipped for vehicle storage and to perform basic maintenance of vehicles.
The Keele Yard (originally known as the Vincent Yard) is a small facility located between Keele station and Dundas West station. It provides for the storage and cleaning of subway trains but not for maintenance. Since June 18, 2017, the yard stores and services four trains overnight with the remaining yard capacity used to store work equipment.

The TTC is planning to build a new subway yard on the site of a former Canadian Pacific Railway freight yard, southwest of Kipling station. When the TTC replaces the T1 subway fleet, it will need space to store the new trains as they are delivered as well as new shops to service them. The Greenwood Yard will be inadequate as it is completely full with no room to expand, and because its facilities are optimized for two-car train sets rather than the six-car train sets of the proposed new fleet. The estimated cost of the new yard was $500million, of which only $7million for planning work was included in the Capital Budget as of July 2017. , the TTC estimated that the Kipling Yard would open in 2031.

== Expansion plans ==

=== Scarborough Subway Extension ===
The Scarborough Subway Extension (SSE) will replace Line 3 Scarborough with an eastward extension of Line 2.
====Early history====
In 1983, there was discussion of a rapid transit extension from Kennedy station to Scarborough City Centre. As multiple types of technologies were examined many politicians requested a subway extension instead of the then proposed streetcar line. Instead, a medium-capacity rail system, known as the Scarborough RT (later renamed Line 3 Scarborough), was built.

In 2005, Toronto City Council again proposed to extend the line northeastward as a replacement for the aging Scarborough RT. In 2006, this proposal was then altered when Scarborough councillors agreed to support plans to refurbish the existing line using other light-metro options for Scarborough. Using heavy-rail rapid transit like the rest of the Toronto subway in Scarborough was not yet examined.

====Light rail proposal (2007–2013)====
In 2007, mayor David Miller included the refurbishment of the Scarborough RT using modern light rail transit as part of his Transit City plan. The light rail line would have run between Kennedy station and Sheppard Avenue East via Scarborough Town Centre. The line would have used the right-of-way of the Scarborough RT, which would have been shut down for conversion to light rail, requiring bus substitution. Construction would have lasted three and a half to five years and cost about $2billion plus an unknown cost to redesign the connection at Kennedy station.

During his 2010 mayoralty campaign, Rob Ford denounced the idea of light rail transit and instead proposed to replace the Scarborough RT with an extension of the Bloor–Danforth line. However, on March 31, 2011, Ford agreed with the provincial government that the province&#x27;s Metrolinx agency would convert the Scarborough RT to light rail as part of the proposed Eglinton Crosstown line project (now Line 5 Eglinton) over the Line 3 right-of-way instead. In June 2012, the idea of a Scarborough subway extension was a key part of Toronto&#x27;s proposed OneCity transit plan. This plan was later rejected by the provincial government and Mayor Rob Ford.

====Three-stop proposal (2013–2016)====
On September 4, 2013, the province of Ontario under Premier Kathleen Wynne decided to extend the Bloor–Danforth subway after all and announced that it would fund two-thirds of the extension from Kennedy to Scarborough City Centre at Scarborough Centre station. The Government of Canada would fund the remaining one-third. Toronto City Council approved the extension by a vote of 24–20 on October 8, 2013. The subway route would extend eastward towards McCowan Road, via Eglinton Avenue and Danforth Road, and proceeding north towards the intersection of McCowan Road and Sheppard Avenue, via Scarborough City Centre. There would be three new stations at Lawrence Avenue East (serving the Scarborough General Hospital), Scarborough Town Centre and Sheppard Avenue East. The city would also raise property taxes annually over the next three years. Digging of the extension was expected to begin as early as 2018, with a completion within five years. As a result of the extension&#x27;s approval, the Eglinton Crosstown line would be cut back to Kennedy station as its eastern terminus and renamed Line 5 Eglinton.

In December 2014, Councillor Glenn De Baeremaeker, one of the city&#x27;s deputy mayors, proposed a fourth stop along the Scarborough Subway Extension, at Danforth Road and Eglinton Avenue to reduce the station spacing between Kennedy station and the next stop from about to . At that time, he was told the extra station would add $100million to $150million to the cost of the extension.

However, a subsequent city staff report indicated that the proposed stations at Lawrence Avenue and at Sheppard Avenue had &quot;little development potential&quot; nearby and were too close to planned SmartTrack stations.

In 2016, when this proposal was abandoned, about five percent of the design was complete, and the cost was estimated at between $4.6billion and $6.9billion.

====One-stop proposal (2016–2019)====
On January 20, 2016, city staff issued a proposal to eliminate two of the three stops on the planned Scarborough Subway Extension and to terminate Line 2 Bloor–Danforth at Scarborough Town Centre. The planned intermediate stop at Lawrence Avenue would be eliminated along with the proposed stretch to Sheppard Avenue. This revised plan would prevent the subway from competing for ridership with SmartTrack&#x27;s branch to Markham. Also, the proposed change was to reduce the cost of the extension from $3.5billion to $2.5billion, where the $1billion saved would be used to extend Line 5 Eglinton east- and northwards to University of Toronto Scarborough. (However, most of the $1billion saved was subsequently diverted back to the SSE to cover additional estimated construction costs for the one-stop subway.)

City planning staff estimated that the peak ridership of the one-stop extension to be 7,300 in the peak hour and peak direction, about half of the 15,000 peak ridership considered the low end to justify a subway. With the original three-stop extension, the peak ridership estimate was 9,500 to 14,000; however, that estimate was reduced to 7,300 because of competition from the proposed SmartTrack and by the elimination of two of the three original stops. Mayor John Tory and Scarborough Councillor Glenn De Baeremaeker say a peak ridership of 7,300 would have still been acceptable as it was still greater than the 6,000 peak at terminal station Kipling. However, a &quot;Toronto Star&quot; article points out there would be only one station within 6 kilometres of Scarborough Town Centre but more stations are within 6 kilometres of other terminal stations to boost ridership. The SSE would have carried an estimated 31,000 riders per day as compared to 66,355 riders from Kipling to Jane (five stations) and 96,660 riders from Finch to York Mills (four stations). The SSE would have performed better in ridership only against the terminal of the underperforming Sheppard line.

In June 2016, the estimated cost of the one-stop SSE was revised from $2billion to $2.9billion because tunnels need to be deeper than expected in some places, with the new terminal station being 45 to 90 per cent deeper. An additional cost factor is that a high water table would require more concrete. There is also a $300million maintenance cost to keep Line 3 Scarborough operating until the SSE&#x27;s opening resulting in a total project cost of $3.2billion.

In February 2017, city staff reported that the estimated cost of the extension would increase by $150million to $3.35billion in order to build a 34-bay bus terminal at Scarborough Town Centre, which was to be the largest bus terminal of the TTC system. Also, the projection for new riders for the extension was revised downwards to 2,300 per day, down from the 4,500 new riders estimated in the summer of 2016.

In March 2017, city staff estimated the extension would take six years to construct with an expected opening in the second quarter of 2026. The project was funded. On March 28, 2017, city council approved the design of the extension via McCowan Road.

According to transit advocate Steve Munro, the SSE would have been built to use only automatic train control (ATC). This would preclude the operation of T1 subway cars on the extension as it would have been too expensive to convert T1 cars to ATC.

In April 2019, city staff revised estimates for the SSE project, by then known as the Line 2 East Extension (L2EE), to a total of $3.87billion with a completion date estimated for end of 2027 and a delayed opening date of 2030 for the bus terminal at Scarborough Centre. In addition, plans for the extension to run ATC upon opening were dropped and instead replaced with the inclusion of &quot;enabling works&quot; allowing for ATC to be implemented at a later date.

====Revised three-stop proposal (2019–present)====
In May 2018, Rob Ford&#x27;s brother Doug Ford – during his campaign to become premier of Ontario – pledged to work on and pay for the three-stop proposal. In July 2018, the TTC was still focused on building the one-stop proposal.

On April 10, 2019, Doug Ford, who had since become premier, announced that the province would revert the extension back to the three-stop proposal at an estimated cost of $5.5billion with an estimated completion date between 2029 and 2030. As with the three-stop proposal of 2013–2016, there would be three new stations located along McCowan Road at Lawrence Avenue, Scarborough Town Centre and Sheppard Avenue East.

In February 2020, Metrolinx released a cost–benefit analysis showing that the $5.5-billion project cost for the three-stop extension is double the estimated benefits of $2.8billion over 60 years. Benefits included reducing travel time and cars on the road. Metrolinx CEO Phil Verster said the estimate of benefits was conservative and Metrolinx may improve the benefits over time.

===== New stations=====
The northern terminus of the extension will be at Sheppard Avenue East and McCowan Road; it will have an adjacent TTC bus terminal as well as a pick-up and drop-off area. The station entrance will be at Sheppard Avenue and McCowan Road. The station design will provide for future extension of Line 4 Sheppard to terminate at this station, as well as further expansion of Line 2 north of the station. Besides TTC buses, the bus terminal will also serve Durham Region Transit and York Region Transit buses.

The future Scarborough Centre station will be located on McCowan Road at a different location from the existing Scarborough Centre station, which will be decommissioned. The new station facilities will be on the north side of McCowan station (also to be decommissioned) and will occupy most of the block bounded by McCowan Road, Progress Avenue, Grangeway Avenue and Busby Drive. The main entrance will be near McCowan Road and Progress Avenue. The new station will have a new Scarborough Centre Bus Terminal serving TTC, GO Transit and Durham Region Transit buses. The bus terminal will be the western terminus of the planned Durham–Scarborough bus rapid transit corridor. The station will also have a pick-up and drop-off area.

A third new, future Lawrence East station will be located beside the Scarborough General Hospital at the northwest corner of Lawrence Avenue East and McCowan Road in a different location from the former Lawrence East station. There will be entrances at the northwest and southwest corners of Lawrence Avenue and McCowan Road. There will be a bus terminal on the south side of Lawrence Avenue between Valparaiso Avenue and McCowan Road.

===== Advance tunnel =====
On March 10, 2020, Metrolinx and Infrastructure Ontario issued a request for qualifications (RFQ) related to advance tunnelling works. On August 20, 2020, Metrolinx issued a request for proposals to shortlisted proponents, including Acciona, East End Connectors (Dragados, Aecon and Ghella) and Strabag. A launch shaft would be constructed at the northeast corner of Sheppard Avenue East and McCowan Road, with an extraction shaft along Eglinton Avenue on the east side of Midland Avenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrolinx-2022/08/04&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On May 25, 2021, Strabag was selected to design, build and finance the tunnel. The scope of the advance tunnel contract included the following:

* tunnelling works for the subway extension, from Kennedy station to McCowan Road / Sheppard Avenue
* design and construction of launch and extraction shafts, tunnels, as well as headwalls for emergency exit buildings and stations
* supply of tunnel boring machines and installation of segmental pre-cast concrete tunnel liners
* activities necessary to build the tunnel (e.g. utility relocations, supports for shaft and headwalls, temporary power supply, lighting, ventilation, and drainage)

Construction on the extension began on June 23, 2021. The SSE tunnel will contain two tracks within a single bore of in diameter and will be the largest subway tunnel by diameter in Toronto. The tunnel boring machine (TBM) was built by Herrenknecht in Schwanau, Germany. Arriving in early 2022, the TBM was transported via sea in multiple shipments for reassembly at the launch site. By January 2023, the TBM (named &quot;Diggy Scardust&quot; after Ziggy Stardust, David Bowie&#x27;s stage persona and fictional character) had started digging at a speed of per day. It will dig of the tunnel.

===== Stations, rails and systems =====
The stations, rails and systems (SRS) contract will be delivered using a progressive design–build delivery strategy. In September 2021, Metrolinx and Infrastructure Ontario released an RFQ to shortlist potential bidders. In February 2022, following the close of the RFQ process, Metrolinx and Infrastructure Ontario released an RFP to three shortlisted bidders: Dragados (including AECOM), KSX Integrated Design-Builders (Kiewit and SNC-Lavalin), and Scarborough Transit Connect (Aecon, FCC Construcción, and Mott MacDonald). In November 2022, Metrolinx and Infrastructure Ontario announced that Scarborough Transit Connect was the successful bidder and would work with the province over an 18- to 24-month development phase to finalize the scope, risk allocation, project costs and project schedule. Once the development phase had concluded, Metrolinx would have the option to execute the project agreement with the development partner to progress to construction, which would include agreements on detailed designs and the final negotiated price. The scope of the SRS contract included the following:

* a extension of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth subway
* Tunnelling work for the length of the alignment
* Three new stations: Lawrence Avenue and McCowan Road, Scarborough Centre, and a terminal station at McCowan Road and Sheppard Avenue
* Emergency exit buildings, traction power substations, and modifications at Kennedy station
* Transit connections to existing TTC Line 2 Bloor–Danforth, Line 5 Eglinton, GO train service (Stouffville line), and Durham Region Transit bus service
* Operating systems for the extension&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrolinx-2022/12/05&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== West to Mississauga ===

The TTC&#x27;s &quot;Rapid Transit Expansion Study&quot;, published in 2001, identified three possible western extensions to the line. The first was a link to Sherway Gardens, with a station added at the East Mall at a later date. The second included an additional from Sherway Gardens to Dixie Road, while a further section from Dixie Road to Mississauga City Centre and Square One Shopping Centre, which included three stations, was considered but rejected due to cost and planning considerations. This was replaced by a planned Dundas LRT run by MiWay going from Kipling station to Hurontario Street, linking to the Hurontario LRT as part of the MoveOntario 2020 transit plan. This plan was revivedalong with the Jane LRT, the Finch West LRT extensions, the Waterfront LRTs, and othersby the &quot;Feeling Congested?&quot; report by the City of Toronto in 2013, as an &quot;unfunded future rapid transit project&quot;.

<text>George Kennedy Young, CB, MBE, M.A. (8 April 1911 – 9 May 1990) was a deputy director of MI6, and later involved in British Conservative Party politics. He was also a merchant banker.

==Early life==
George Kennedy Young was born in Dumfries, and was raised by his parents in the United Free Church. He was educated at Dumfries Academy and the University of St Andrews, where he studied French and German and spent two years as an exchange student at the Universities of Dijon (now the University of Burgundy) and Giessen respectively. After graduating with a first-class degree in 1934, Young secured a Commonwealth Fellowship to study Political Science at Yale University. During his undergraduate years he was a left-wing partisan, with &quot;strong Independent Labour Party views&quot;. Before the Second World War he was on the editorial staff of the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot;. 

==Career in British intelligence==
He was commissioned in 1940 as an officer in the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers regiment but later transferred to British intelligence. In his book &quot;Inside Intelligence&quot;, Anthony Cavendish, a friend and colleague of Young, includes a seventeen-page summary of Young&#x27;s career (Young also wrote the foreword for this book). According to Cavendish, Young&#x27;s intelligence career started in the Second World War. He was employed first in Africa and later in Italy and North-West Europe, where his work involved &#x27;playing back&#x27; captured enemy agents as channels for disinformation. Young became an expert in the methods of the Italian Fascist police system and those of the German secret services.

Following the war, after a brief return to journalism, Young returned to the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) as head of its Vienna station, where he was involved in running agents in South-East Europe. In 1949 he was made head of SIS&#x27;s economic requirements section (R6), their point of contact with the Treasury, the Board of Trade and the Bank of England. In 1951 he was appointed controller of SIS operations in the &#x27;Middle East Area&#x27;, which stretched from Morocco to Afghanistan and down to Ethiopia. Here he became involved in implementing the Anglo-American decision to remove the Iranian leader Mossadeq and reinstate the Shah. According to Cavendish, the Shah later said of Young that &quot;In times of crisis he is a man who can take decisions and throw caution to the winds. Young is a man who believes that friendship cuts both ways and that Britain should stand by her friends even at the risk of offending others.&quot; In 1953 Young was recalled to London to take over as SIS Director of Requirements and in 1956, during the Suez crisis, he was again put in charge of Middle East Operations. In 1959 he was appointed Vice Chief of the Secret Service. His dissatisfaction with the Macmillan government led him to resign as Deputy of MI6 in 1961 and enter merchant banking.

==Political activity==
Shortly after settling down into merchant banking, G. K. (as he was commonly known) became Chairman of the libertarian Society for Individual Freedom. He was also an early and leading member of the Conservative Monday Club, serving on the Executive Council and several of its policy committees (he was Chairman of the Action Fund from 1967 to 1969 and later Chairman of the Economics Committee). He was strongly opposed to immigration, supporting Enoch Powell&#x27;s line, and helped found the club&#x27;s immigration committee. After losing an acrimonious election for the position of club chairman to Jonathan Guinness in 1974, in which he had been supported by the National Front, he set up the right-wing group Tory Action. That same year, Young stood as the Conservative candidate for Brent East in the February General Election, losing badly to the sitting Labour MP Reg Freeson in what was later described as a &quot;gesture of principle&quot;. In 1976, assisted by the Conservative MP Frederic Bennett, Young created the vigilante group Unison, described by the academic Rory Cormac as &quot;ready to intervene when law and order broke down amidst a communist takeover.&quot;

A London-based Czech spy, Jan Mrazek, has cited Young as a likely conspirator in a plot to undermine Edward Heath. David Leigh wrote that Young was closely associated with alleged attempts to undermine the Labour government of Harold Wilson in the mid-1960s, that he regarded the Tory government of Edward Heath as virtually socialist, and planned action to remove those he considered enemies of the state: &quot;a security counter-action need cover no more than 5,000 persons, including some 40 MPs., not all of them Labour; several hundred journalists and media employees, plus their supporting academics and clerics; the full-time members and main activists of the C.P.G.B. and the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party; and the directing elements of the 30 or 40 bodies affecting concern and compassion for youth, age, civil liberties, social research, and minority grievances.&quot;

In November 2015, the then Labour MP John Mann said that information provided to him indicated that Young was involved in a right-wing Conservative group which gathered details on alleged paedophiles within the House of Commons. Young was not named as a paedophile but Mann described him as a “manipulator” who had been involved in &quot;dubious&quot; political activities, including a campaign to set up a private army.

==Family==
In June 1939 Young married Geraldine Wilhelmine Christine Harthoorn (born 21 December 1913 in Pandang/Celebes, Dutch East Indies; died 8 October 2000 in London), a daughter of M. A. G. Harthoorn, a Dutch lawyer and president of the court at Batavia, Dutch East Indies, and Gerardina Willemina Christina Brunsveld van Hulten. Geraldine (known as Géryke) was a strong supporter of her husband&#x27;s political convictions, often voicing what John Bruce Lockhart euphemistically referred to as &quot;her views about the role of different ethnic groups.&quot; Lockhart surmised that &quot;It is hard to estimate the degree of influence she had over Young&#x27;s change from a left-wing student of the 1930s to a powerful figure in the right-wing Monday Club, but it was substantial.&quot; The marriage remained childless.

<text>The Spacewatch Project is an astronomical survey that specializes in the study of minor planets, including various types of asteroids and comets at University of Arizona telescopes on Kitt Peak near Tucson, Arizona. The Spacewatch Project has been active longer than any other similar currently active programs.

Spacewatch was founded in 1980 by Tom Gehrels and Robert S. McMillan, and is currently led by astronomer Melissa Brucker at the University of Arizona. Spacewatch uses several telescopes on Kitt Peak for follow-up observations of near-Earth objects.

The Spacewatch Project uses three telescopes of apertures 0.9-m, 1.8-m, and 2.3-m. These telescopes are located on Kitt Peak, and the first two are dedicated to the purpose of locating Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).

The 36 inch (0.9 meter) telescope on Kitt Peak has been in use by Spacewatch since 1984, and since 2000 the 72 inch (1.8 meter) Spacewatch telescope. The 36 inch telescope continued in use and was further upgraded, in particular, the telescopes use electronic detectors.

Spacewatch&#x27;s 1.8-meter telescope is the largest in the world that is used exclusively for asteroids and comets. It can find asteroids and comets anywhere from the space near Earth to regions beyond the orbit of Neptune and to do astrometry on the fainter of objects that are already known. The telescope is pointed on stars and tracked with a real time video-rate camera at folded prime focus.

Spacewatch was the first to use CCDs to survey the sky for comets and asteroids. When added, they permitted faster coverage of the sky than the pre-2002 system.

Each year, Spacewatch observes approximately 35 radar targets, 50 near-Earth objects, and 100 potential spacecraft rendezvous destinations. From 2013 to 2016, Spacewatch observed half of all NEOs and potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) observed by anyone in that time. , Spacewatch had discovered over 179,000 minor planets numbered by the Minor Planet Center.

== History ==
The 1.8 meter Spacewatch telescope and its building on Kitt Peak were dedicated on June 7, 1997 for the purpose of finding previously unknown asteroids and comets. Since January 1 2003, Spacewatch has made ~2400 separate-night detections of Near-Earth Objects.

There was an upgrade to the 0.9 meter which was funded by NASA and the Kirsch Foundation.

The Spacewatch Project is the longest-running of all present programs of astrometry of solar system objects.

== Spacewatch in Action ==
Spacewatch conducted a survey that was proposed May 12, 2006, and accepted on November 13, 2006. This survey used data taken over 34 months by the University of Arizona’s Spacewatch Project based at Steward Observatory, Kitt Peak. Spacewatch revisited the same sky area every three to seven nights in order to track cohorts of main-belt asteroids. This survey discovered one new large Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) and detected six others. This proved that new sweeps of the sky are productive even if they have been previously examined simply due to the complexities of running large surveys over many nights and variable conditions.

<doc id="614297" wikidata="Q795619" url="?curid=614297" title="Solvay process">
<text>The Solvay process or ammonia–soda process is the major industrial process for the production of sodium carbonate (soda ash, Na2CO3). The ammonia–soda process was developed into its modern form by the Belgian chemist Ernest Solvay during the 1860s. The ingredients for this are readily available and inexpensive: salt brine (from inland sources or from the sea) and limestone (from quarries). The worldwide production of soda ash in 2005 was estimated at 42 million tonnes, which is more than six kilograms () per year for each person on Earth. Solvay-based chemical plants now produce roughly three-quarters of this supply, with the remaining being mined from natural deposits. This method superseded the Leblanc process.

== History ==

The name &quot;soda ash&quot; is based on the principal historical method of obtaining alkali, which was by using water to extract it from the ashes of certain plants. Wood fires yielded potash and its predominant ingredient potassium carbonate (K2CO3), whereas the ashes from these special plants yielded &quot;soda ash&quot; and its predominant ingredient sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). The word &quot;soda&quot; (from the Middle Latin) originally referred to certain plants that grow in salt solubles; it was discovered that the ashes of these plants yielded the useful alkali soda ash. The cultivation of such plants reached a particularly high state of development in the 18th century in Spain, where the plants are named &quot;barrilla&quot; (or &quot;barilla&quot; in English). The ashes of kelp also yield soda ash and were the basis of an enormous 18th-century industry in Scotland. Alkali was also mined from dry lakebeds in Egypt.

By the late 18th century these sources were insufficient to meet Europe&#x27;s burgeoning demand for alkali for soap, textile, and glass industries. In 1791, the French physician Nicolas Leblanc developed a method to manufacture soda ash using salt, limestone, sulfuric acid, and coal. Although the Leblanc process came to dominate alkali production in the early 19th century, the expense of its inputs and its polluting byproducts (including hydrogen chloride gas) made it apparent that it was far from an ideal solution.

It has been reported that in 1811 French physicist Augustin Jean Fresnel discovered that sodium bicarbonate precipitates when carbon dioxide is bubbled through ammonia-containing brines – which is the chemical reaction central to the Solvay process. The discovery wasn&#x27;t published. As has been noted by Desmond Reilly, &quot;The story of the evolution of the ammonium–soda process is an interesting example of the way in which a discovery can be made and then laid aside and not applied for a considerable time afterwards.&quot; Serious consideration of this reaction as the basis of an industrial process dates from the British patent issued in 1834 to H. G. Dyar and J. Hemming. There were several attempts to reduce this reaction to industrial practice, with varying success.

In 1861, Belgian industrial chemist Ernest Solvay turned his attention to the problem; he was apparently largely unaware of the extensive earlier work. His solution was a gas absorption tower in which carbon dioxide bubbled up through a descending flow of brine. This, together with efficient recovery and recycling of the ammonia, proved effective. By 1864 Solvay and his brother Alfred had acquired financial backing and constructed a plant in Couillet, today a suburb of the Belgian town of Charleroi. The new process proved more economical and less polluting than the Leblanc method, and its use spread. In 1874, the Solvays expanded their facilities with a new, larger plant at Nancy, France.

In the same year, Ludwig Mond visited Solvay in Belgium and acquired rights to use the new technology. He and John Brunner formed the firm of Brunner, Mond &amp; Co., and built a Solvay plant at Winnington, near Northwich, Cheshire, England. The facility began operating in 1874. Mond was instrumental in making the Solvay process a commercial success. He made several refinements between 1873 and 1880 that removed byproducts that could slow or halt the process.

In 1884, the Solvay brothers licensed Americans William B. Cogswell and Rowland Hazard to produce soda ash in the US, and formed a joint venture (Solvay Process Company) to build and operate a plant in Solvay, New York.

By the 1890s, Solvay-process plants produced the majority of the world&#x27;s soda ash.

In 1938 large deposits of the mineral trona were discovered near the Green River in Wyoming from which sodium carbonate can be extracted more cheaply than produced by the process. The original Solvay New York plant closed in 1986, replaced in the US by a factory in Green River. Throughout the rest of the world, the Solvay process remains the major source of soda ash.

== Chemistry ==
The Solvay process results in soda ash (predominantly sodium carbonate (Na2CO3)) from brine (as a source of sodium chloride (NaCl)) and from limestone (as a source of calcium carbonate (CaCO3)). The overall process is:

: &lt;chem&gt;2NaCl + CaCO3 -&gt; Na2CO3 + CaCl2 &lt;/chem&gt;

The actual implementation of this global, overall reaction is intricate. A simplified description can be given using the four different, interacting chemical reactions illustrated in the figure. In the first step in the process, carbon dioxide (CO2) passes through a concentrated aqueous solution of sodium chloride (table salt, NaCl) and ammonia (NH3).

: &lt;chem&gt;NaCl + CO2 + NH3 + H2O -&gt; NaHCO3 + NH4Cl&lt;/chem&gt; ---(I)

In industrial practice, the reaction is carried out by passing concentrated brine (salt water) through two towers. In the first, ammonia bubbles up through the brine and is absorbed by it. In the second, carbon dioxide bubbles up through the ammoniated brine, and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) precipitates out of the solution. Note that, in a basic solution, NaHCO3 is less water-soluble than sodium chloride. The ammonia (NH3) buffers the solution at a basic (high) pH; without the ammonia, a hydrochloric acid byproduct would render the solution acidic, and arrest the precipitation. Here, NH3 along with ammoniacal brine acts as a mother liquor.

The necessary ammonia &quot;catalyst&quot; for reaction (I) is reclaimed in a later step, and relatively little ammonia is consumed. The carbon dioxide required for reaction (I) is produced by heating (&quot;calcination&quot;) of the limestone at 950–1100 °C, and by calcination of the sodium bicarbonate (see below). The calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the limestone is partially converted to quicklime (calcium oxide (CaO)) and carbon dioxide:

: &lt;chem&gt;CaCO3 -&gt; CO2 + CaO&lt;/chem&gt; ---(II)

The sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) that precipitates out in reaction (I) is filtered out from the hot ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) solution, and the solution is then reacted with the quicklime (calcium oxide (CaO)) left over from heating the limestone in step (II).

: &lt;chem&gt;2 NH4Cl + CaO -&gt; 2 NH3 + CaCl2 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt; ---(III)

CaO makes a strong basic solution. The ammonia from reaction (III) is recycled back to the initial brine solution of reaction (I).

The sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) precipitate from reaction (I) is then converted to the final product, sodium carbonate (washing soda: Na2CO3), by calcination (160–230 °C), producing water and carbon dioxide as byproducts:

: &lt;chem&gt;2 NaHCO3 -&gt; Na2CO3 + H2O + CO2&lt;/chem&gt; ---(IV)

The carbon dioxide from step (IV) is recovered for re-use in step (I). When properly designed and operated, a Solvay plant can reclaim almost all its ammonia, and consumes only small amounts of additional ammonia to make up for losses. The only major inputs to the Solvay process are salt, limestone and thermal energy, and its only major byproduct is calcium chloride, which is sometimes sold as road salt.

After the invention of the Haber and other new ammonia-producing processes in the 1910s and 1920s its price dropped, and there was less need in reclaiming it. So in the modified Solvay process developed by Chinese chemist Hou Debang in 1930s, the first few steps are the same as the Solvay process, but the CaCl2 is supplanted by ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). Instead of treating the remaining solution with lime, carbon dioxide and ammonia are pumped into the solution, then sodium chloride is added until the solution saturates at 40 °C. Next, the solution is cooled to 10 °C. Ammonium chloride precipitates and is removed by filtration, and the solution is recycled to produce more sodium carbonate. Hou&#x27;s process eliminates the production of calcium chloride. The byproduct ammonium chloride can be refined, used as a fertilizer and may have greater commercial value than CaCl2, thus reducing the extent of waste beds.

Additional details of the industrial implementation of this process are available in the report prepared for the European Soda Ash Producer&#x27;s Association.

== Byproducts and wastes ==
The principal byproduct of the Solvay process is calcium chloride (CaCl2) in aqueous solution. The process has other waste and byproducts as well. Not all of the limestone that is calcined is converted to quicklime and carbon dioxide (in reaction II); the residual calcium carbonate and other components of the limestone become wastes. In addition, the salt brine used by the process is usually purified to remove magnesium and calcium ions, typically to form carbonates (MgCO3, CaCO3); otherwise, these impurities would lead to scale in the various reaction vessels and towers. These carbonates are additional waste products.

In inland plants, such as that in Solvay, New York, the byproducts have been deposited in &quot;waste beds&quot;; the weight of material deposited in these waste beds exceeded that of the soda ash produced by about 50%. These waste beds have led to water pollution, principally by calcium and chloride. The waste beds in Solvay, New York substantially increased the salinity in nearby Onondaga Lake, which used to be among the most polluted lakes in the U.S. and is a superfund pollution site. As such waste beds age, they do begin to support plant communities which have been the subject of several scientific studies.

At seaside locations, such as those at Saurashtra, Gujarat, India, the CaCl2 solution may be discharged directly into the sea, apparently without substantial environmental harm (although small amounts of heavy metals in it may be a problem), the major concern is discharge location falls within the Marine National Park of Gulf of Kutch which serves as habitat for coral reefs, seagrass and seaweed community. At Osborne, South Australia, a settling pond is now used to remove 99% of the CaCl2 as the former discharge was silting up the shipping channel. At Rosignano Solvay in Tuscany, Italy the limestone waste produced by the Solvay factory has changed the landscape, producing the &quot;Spiagge Bianche&quot; (&quot;White Beaches&quot;). A report published in 1999 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), listed Spiagge Bianche among the priority pollution hot spots in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.

== Carbon sequestration and the Solvay process ==

Variations in the Solvay process have been proposed for carbon sequestration. One idea is to react carbon dioxide, produced perhaps by the combustion of coal, to form solid carbonates (such as sodium bicarbonate) that could be permanently stored, thus avoiding carbon dioxide emission into the atmosphere. The Solvay process could be modified to give the overall reaction:

: 2 NaCl + CaCO3 + + → 2NaHCO3 + CaCl2

Variations in the Solvay process have been proposed to convert carbon dioxide emissions into sodium carbonates, but carbon sequestration by calcium or magnesium carbonates appears more promising. However, the amount of carbon dioxide which can be used for carbon sequestration with calcium or magnesium (when compared to the total amount of carbon dioxide exhausted by mankind) is very low. This is primarily due to the major feasibility difference between capturing carbon dioxide from controlled and concentrated emission sources such as from coal-fired power plants as compared to capturing carbon from non-concentrated small-scale carbon sources such as small fires, vehicle exhaust, human respiration etc. when using such methods. Moreover, variation on the Solvay process will most probably add an additional energy consuming step, which will increase carbon dioxide emissions unless carbon neutral energy sources like hydropower, nuclear energy, wind or solar power are used.

<text>Hydrocarbon exploration (or oil and gas exploration) is the search by petroleum geologists and geophysicists for deposits of hydrocarbons, particularly petroleum and natural gas, in the Earth&#x27;s crust using petroleum geology.

== Exploration methods ==

Visible surface features such as oil seeps, natural gas seeps, pockmarks (underwater craters caused by escaping gas) provide basic evidence of hydrocarbon generation (be it shallow or deep in the Earth). However, most exploration depends on highly sophisticated technology to detect and determine the extent of these deposits using exploration geophysics. Areas thought to contain hydrocarbons are initially subjected to a gravity survey, magnetic survey, passive seismic or regional seismic reflection surveys to detect large-scale features of the sub-surface geology. Features of interest (known as &quot;leads&quot;) are subjected to more detailed seismic surveys which work on the principle of the time it takes for reflected sound waves to travel through matter (rock) of varying densities and using the process of depth conversion to create a profile of the substructure. Finally, when a prospect has been identified and evaluated and passes the oil company&#x27;s selection criteria, an exploration well is drilled in an attempt to conclusively determine the presence or absence of oil or gas. Offshore the risk can be reduced by using electromagnetic methods 

Oil exploration is an expensive, high-risk operation. Offshore and remote area exploration is generally only undertaken by very large corporations or national governments. Typical shallow shelf oil wells (e.g. North Sea) cost US$10 – 30 million, while deep water wells can cost up to US$100 million plus. Hundreds of smaller companies search for onshore hydrocarbon deposits worldwide, with some wells costing as little as US$100,000.

== Elements of a petroleum prospect ==
A prospect is a potential trap which geologists believe may contain hydrocarbons. A significant amount of geological, structural and seismic investigation must first be completed to redefine the potential hydrocarbon drill location from a lead to a prospect. Four geological factors have to be present for a prospect to work and if any of them fail neither oil nor gas will be present.

; Source rock : When organic-rich rock such as oil shale or coal is subjected to high pressure and temperature over an extended period of time, hydrocarbons form.
; Migration : The hydrocarbons are expelled from source rock by three density-related mechanisms: the newly matured hydrocarbons are less dense than their precursors, which causes over-pressure; the hydrocarbons are lighter, and so migrate upwards due to buoyancy, and the fluids expand as further burial causes increased heating. Most hydrocarbons migrate to the surface as oil seeps, but some will get trapped.
; Reservoir : The hydrocarbons are contained in a reservoir rock. This is commonly a porous sandstone or limestone. The oil collects in the pores within the rock although open fractures within non-porous rocks (e.g. fractured granite) may also store hydrocarbons. The reservoir must also be permeable so that the hydrocarbons will flow to surface during production.
; Trap : The hydrocarbons are buoyant and have to be trapped within a structural (e.g. Anticline, fault block) or stratigraphic trap. The hydrocarbon trap has to be covered by an impermeable rock known as a seal or cap-rock in order to prevent hydrocarbons escaping to the surface.
== Exploration risk ==

Hydrocarbon exploration is a high risk investment and risk assessment is paramount for successful project portfolio management. Exploration risk is a difficult concept and is usually defined by assigning confidence to the presence of the imperative geological factors, as discussed above. This confidence is based on data and/or models and is usually mapped on Common Risk Segment Maps (CRS Maps). High confidence in the presence of imperative geological factors is usually coloured green and low confidence coloured red. Therefore, these maps are also called Traffic Light Maps, while the full procedure is often referred to as Play Fairway Analysis (PFA). The aim of such procedures is to force the geologist to objectively assess all different geological factors. Furthermore, it results in simple maps that can be understood by non-geologists and managers to base exploration decisions on.

== Terms used in petroleum evaluation ==

; Bright spot : On a seismic section, coda that have high amplitudes due to a formation containing hydrocarbons.
; Chance of success: An estimate of the chance of all the elements (see above) within a prospect working, described as a probability. 
; Dry hole : A boring that does not contain commercial hydrocarbons. See also Dry-hole clause
; Flat spot : Possibly an oil-water, gas-water or gas-oil contact on a seismic section; flat due to gravity.
; Full Waveform Inversion : A supercomputer technique recently use in conjunction with seismic sensors to explore for petroleum deposits offshore.
; Hydrocarbon in place : Amount of hydrocarbon likely to be contained in the prospect. This is calculated using the volumetric equation - GRV x N/G x Porosity x Sh / FVF
:; Gross rock volume (GRV) : Amount of rock in the trap above the hydrocarbon water contact
:; Net sand : Part of GRV that has the lithological capacity for being a productive zone; i.e. less shale contaminations.
:; Net reserve : Part of net sand that has the minimum reservoir qualities; i.e. minimum porosity and permeability values.
:; Net/gross ratio (N/G) : Proportion of the GRV formed by the reservoir rock (range is 0 to 1)
:; Porosity : Percentage of the net reservoir rock occupied by pores (typically 5-35%)
:; Hydrocarbon saturation (Sh) : Some of the pore space is filled with water - this must be discounted
:; Formation volume factor (FVF) : Oil shrinks and gas expands when brought to the surface. The FVF converts volumes at reservoir conditions (high pressure and high temperature) to storage and sale conditions
; Lead : Potential accumulation is currently poorly defined and requires more data acquisition and/or evaluation in order to be classified as a prospect. 
; Play : An area in which hydrocarbon accumulations or prospects of a given type occur. For example, the shale gas plays in North America include the Barnett, Eagle Ford, Fayetteville, Haynesville, Marcellus, and Woodford, among many others. 
; Prospect : A lead which has been more fully evaluated.
; Recoverable hydrocarbons : Amount of hydrocarbon likely to be recovered during production. This is typically 10-50% in an oil field and 50-80% in a gas field.

== Licensing ==

Petroleum resources are typically owned by the government of the host country. In the United States, most onshore (land) oil and gas rights (OGM) are owned by private individuals, in which case oil companies must negotiate terms for a lease of these rights with the individual who owns the OGM. Sometimes this is not the same person who owns the land surface. In most nations the government issues licences to explore, develop and produce its oil and gas resources, which are typically administered by the oil ministry. There are several different types of licence. Oil companies often operate in joint ventures to spread the risk; one of the companies in the partnership is designated the operator who actually supervises the work.

; Tax and Royalty : Companies would pay a royalty on any oil produced, together with a profits tax (which can have expenditure offset against it). In some cases there are also various bonuses and ground rents (license fees) payable to the government - for example a signature bonus payable at the start of the licence. Licences are awarded in competitive bid rounds on the basis of either the size of the work programme (number of wells, seismic etc.) or size of the signature bonus.
; Production Sharing contract (PSA) : A PSA is more complex than a Tax/Royalty system - The companies bid on the percentage of the production that the host government receives (this may be variable with the oil price), There is often also participation by the Government owned National Oil Company (NOC). There are also various bonuses to be paid. Development expenditure is offset against production revenue.
; Service contract : This is when an oil company acts as a contractor for the host government, being paid to produce the hydrocarbons.

== Reserves and resources ==

Resources are hydrocarbons which may or may not be produced in the future. A resource number may be assigned to an undrilled prospect or an unappraised discovery. Appraisal by drilling additional delineation wells or acquiring extra seismic data will confirm the size of the field and lead to project sanction. At this point the relevant government body gives the oil company a production licence which enables the field to be developed. This is also the point at which oil reserves and gas reserves can be formally booked.

===Oil and gas reserves===
Oil and gas reserves are defined as volumes that will be commercially recovered in the future. Reserves are separated into three categories: proved, probable, and possible. To be included in any reserves category, all commercial aspects must have been addressed, which includes government consent. Technical issues alone separate proved from unproved categories. All reserve estimates involve some degree of uncertainty.

*Proved reserves are the highest valued category. Proved reserves have a &quot;reasonable certainty&quot; of being recovered, which means a high degree of confidence that the volumes will be recovered. Some industry specialists refer to this as P90, i.e., having a 90% certainty of being produced. The SEC provides a more detailed definition:
Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
* Probable reserves are volumes defined as &quot;less likely to be recovered than proved, but more certain to be recovered than Possible Reserves&quot;. Some industry specialists refer to this as P50, i.e., having a 50% certainty of being produced.
* Possible reserves are reserves which analysis of geological and engineering data suggests are less likely to be recoverable than probable reserves. Some industry specialists refer to this as P10, i.e., having a 10% certainty of being produced.

The term 1P is frequently used to denote proved reserves; 2P is the sum of proved and probable reserves; and 3P the sum of proved, probable, and possible reserves. The best estimate of recovery from committed projects is generally considered to be the 2P sum of proved and probable reserves. Note that these volumes only refer to currently justified projects or those projects already in development.

===Reserve booking===

Oil and gas reserves are the main asset of an oil company. Booking is the process by which they are added to the balance sheet.

In the United States, booking is done according to a set of rules developed by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). The reserves of any company listed on the New York Stock Exchange have to be stated to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Reported reserves may be audited by outside geologists, although this is not a legal requirement.

In Russia, companies report their reserves to the State Commission on Mineral Reserves (GKZ).

<doc id="614304" wikidata="Q272406" url="?curid=614304" title="Chagang Province">
<text>Chagang Province (; ) is a province of North Korea; it is bordered by China&#x27;s Jilin and Liaoning provinces to the north, Ryanggang and South Hamgyong to the east, South Pyongan to the south, and North Pyongan to the west. Chagang was formed in 1949, after being demarcated from North Pyongan. The provincial capital is Kanggye. Before 2019, Chagang was the only province of North Korea completely inaccessible to tourists, possibly due to weapons factories and nuclear weapon facilities located there. In 2019 the city of Manpo became accessible to tourists. In May 2018, the province became a &quot;Special Songun (military first) Revolutionary Zone&quot; in relations to concealing the nuclear weapon and weapon&#x27;s factories within the province.

==Geography==
Chagang Province is located in the northwestern part of Korea. It is a mountainous province; with the mountainous area amounting to 98 per cent of its total area. The mean height above sea level is 750 meters and the slope of most regions is 15 to 40 degrees.

The province has a distinct continental climate under the influence of the Asian continent. It has very cold and long winters, and brief springs and falls. The climate is characterized by great differences in daily and yearly temperature. In summer, downpours of rain and hail are frequent. Thus thunder and lightning occur frequently.

The province has great mineral wealth, and is North Korea&#x27;s main source of lead, zinc, gold, copper, molybdenum, tungsten, antimony, graphite, apatite, alunite, limestone, calcium carbonate, anthracite and iron ores. There are also crystals and valuable gems there.

==Main cities and economic activities==
The province abounds in underground, forest and water resources. Before the Korean War, Chagang province was an isolated land with only two primitive mines, one timber mill and a distillery.

Nowadays, it has power, machine, chemical, light, mining and timber industries. Its total industrial output is 1000 times as much as just before the war.

The majority of North Korea&#x27;s underground military industrial facilities are located in Chagang Province, including portions of their weapons of mass destruction program.

Kanggye is the capital city of Chagang Province. One of the main economic timber processing factories of the province, and the country, is located in Kanggye.

Huichon is the most developed city in the province, though. Its development dates back to the Korean War, when it became one of the cities of industrial relocation, as it was isolated and far from the main battlefields.

Nowadays, Huichon has several industries, such as a huge machine tool factory, silk mill and a hard glassware factory. In Huichon there is the main North Korean University of Telecommunications.

Chagang was one of the less developed and isolated provinces in North Korea after liberation in 1945. The terrain made farming difficult and only slash-and-burn farmers tilled mountain plots to eke out a living.

Nowadays, farming activities are mainly linked with livestock activities. One example is Hungju Farm.

==Tourism in Chagang Province==

The Chagang Province for a while was the only province in North Korea that tourists could not go to. The main reason believed to be why they were not allowed to was due to the province being home to weapons and nuclear weapon factories and sites. Prior to April 2019, the only part that was accessible for tourist in the Chagang Province was the Huichon Hotel.

However, in April 2019, the province was opened to tourist in which they could go to the city of Manpo. The city is located right across the river from China.

==Small and medium-size power stations==
The province has been converted into a power base for the country, with the construction of Kanggye Youth Power Station, Unbong Power Station, Jangjagang Power Station and other large hydroelectric power stations. The chief hydropower engineer of the city is Kihan Sung.

The province has built since the 90s many small and medium-sized power stations, as a duty of the local authorities. Log-dam, water-course, raft and sluice were among the efficient methods practised in their construction.

Small hydraulic turbines, with a capacity of 2 kW to 70 kW, were developed by local technicians to dramatically increase the generating capacity.

==Administrative divisions==
Chagang is divided into 3 cities (&quot;si&quot;) and 15 counties (&quot;gun&quot;).

<doc id="614306" wikidata="Q2077107" url="?curid=614306" title="Slapstick (novel)">
<text>Slapstick, orLonesome No More! is a novel by American author Kurt Vonnegut. Written in 1976, it depicts Vonnegut&#x27;s views of loneliness, both on an individual and social scale.

== Explanation of title ==
&quot;Slapstick&quot; is dedicated to Arthur Stanley Jefferson and Norvell Hardy (better known as Laurel and Hardy), and the title of the novel is in reference to the physical and situational comedy style that duo employed. Vonnegut explains the title himself in the opening lines of the book&#x27;s prologue:

&quot;This is the closest I will ever come to writing an autobiography. I have called it &quot;Slapstick&quot; because it is grotesque, situational poetry -- like the slapstick film comedies, especially those of Laurel and Hardy, of long ago. It is about what life &quot;feels&quot; like to me.&quot;
== Plot introduction ==

The novel is in the form of an autobiography of Dr. Wilbur Daffodil-11 Swain. Dr. Swain tells us that he lives in the ruins of the Empire State Building with his pregnant granddaughter, Melody Oriole-2 von Peterswald, and her lover, Isadore Raspberry-19 Cohen. Dr. Swain is a hideous man whose ugliness, along with that of his twin sister Eliza, led their parents to cut them off from modern society. The siblings came to realize that, when in close physical contact, they form a vastly powerful and creative intelligence. Through reading and philosophizing together, Wilbur and Eliza combated the feelings of loneliness and isolation that would otherwise have ruined their childhood.

Throughout the book, Wilbur claims that his sister Eliza is the more intelligent of the two, but that no one realizes it because she can&#x27;t read or write. Wilbur and Eliza are like two halves of a brain, with Wilbur the left brain—logical, rational, able to communicate—and Eliza the right brain: creative, emotional, but unable to communicate effectively.

The siblings created, among other things, a plan to end loneliness in America through vast extended families. Under the plan, all citizens would be provided with new middle names, made of the name of a random natural object paired with a random number between 1 and 20. Everyone with the same name would be cousins, and everyone with the same name and number would be siblings.

Their parents and the staff of the mansion believe the children are intellectually disabled, and the children play this up when in the company of others, so as to not interfere with what they view as a perfect childhood. But after hearing their mother wish that they were normal, the children reveal their intelligence to their parents.

Eliza is still deemed disabled, and is sent to a mental institution. Wilbur however is sent to a prep school and eventually goes to Harvard University and earns a doctorate.

Armed with the plan created with Eliza and the slogan, &quot;Lonesome No More!,&quot; Dr. Swain wins election to the Presidency, and devotes the waning energies of the Federal government to the implementation of the plan. In the meantime, Western civilization is nearing collapse as oil runs out, and the Chinese are making vast leaps forward by miniaturizing themselves and training groups of hundreds to think as one. Eventually, the miniaturization proceeds to the point that the Chinese become so small they cause a plague among those who accidentally inhale them, ultimately destroying Western civilization beyond repair. However, even as life as we know it collapses, Swain&#x27;s middle name policy continues to unite the survivors. The American population constantly risk their time and their lives to selflessly help their fellow cousins and siblings, ensuring that people may live their lives &quot;lonesome no more.&quot;

The novel has a typical Vonnegut pattern of short snippets often ending with a punchline of sorts. These are separated by the words &quot;hi ho&quot;, which Dr. Swain describes as a sort of verbal hiccup that has developed in his old age.

== Religion and belief in an afterlife ==
Vonnegut does not believe that traditional religions can cure loneliness or provide significant comfort. His take on belief in the afterlife is satirical. In his novel he describes a &quot;Church of Jesus Christ the Kidnapped&quot; which becomes a dominant American religion in the post-apocalyptic world of the novel. Vonnegut finds the church followers&#x27; behavior comical:

He was jerking his head around in what then seemed an eccentric manner, as though hoping to catch someone peering out at him from behind a potted palm tree or an easy chair, or even from directly overhead, from the crystal chandelier.
==Anthropological social plan==
Vonnegut is concerned about the transitoriness of the modern lifestyle, wherein people are forced to leave their familial and cultural roots and trade those for professional and financial security. He explains in an interview:

Well, I am used to the rootlessness that goes with my profession. But I would like people to be able to stay in one community for a lifetime, to travel away from it to see the world, but always to come home again...Until recent times, you know, human beings usually had a permanent community of relatives. They had dozens of homes to go to. So when a married couple had a fight, one or the other could go to a house three doors down and stay with a close relative until he was feeling tender again. Or if a kid was so fed up with his parents that he couldn&#x27;t stand it, he could march over his uncle&#x27;s for a while. And this is no longer possible. Each family is locked into its little box. The neighbors aren&#x27;t relatives. There aren&#x27;t other houses where people can go and be cared for.

Vonnegut was influenced by the theories of Robert Redfield, from whom he took courses at the University of Chicago. Vonnegut recalls:

When I went to the University of Chicago, and I heard the head of the Department of Anthropology, Robert Redfield, lecture on the folk society, which was essentially a stable, isolated extended family, he did not have to tell me how nice that could be.
Vonnegut identifies the root of the problem in the modernisation of production techniques in the world of economics, but instead of suggesting going back to the way of life of the nineteenth century, he designs an anthropological plan wherein extended families are created by the government with the same ease of implementation as in the distribution of Social Security numbers. Peter J. Reed, author of the bibliography &quot;Vonnegut in America&quot; says:

Though all of the slapstick mocking the idea ... some reasonably serious defence of extended family survives.

The idea of artificially extended families aims to increase the welfare and social support of the individual. However, it is not a utopian dream. Wilbur, the novel&#x27;s protagonist, explains during his election campaign for the presidency how any request for money from a street beggar in the new social order should be treated: 

You ask him his middle name, and when he tells you &quot;Oyster-19&quot; or &quot;Chickadee-1&quot; or &quot;Hollyhock-13&quot; you say to him: &quot;Buster - I happen to be a Uranium-3. You have one hundred and ninety thousand cousins and ten thousand brothers and sisters. You&#x27;re not exactly alone in this world. I have relatives of my own to look after. So why don&#x27;t you take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut? Why don&#x27;t you take a flying fuck at the moooooooooooon?&quot;
==Reception==
According to Vonnegut, &quot;Slapstick&quot; received negative reviews &quot;in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&quot;.

==Film adaptation==
The book was adapted into the 1982 film &quot;Slapstick of Another Kind&quot;.

<text>The British League of Rights was an offshoot of the Australian League of Rights founded in 1971. It was an &quot;anti-semitic and white supremacist&quot; political group. The British League opposed the entry of the UK into the European Economic Community.

In the early 1970s, it came under the direction of Don Martin, a former member of the Australian Young Liberals, who has run it ever since. Under Martin&#x27;s direction the British League increased its membership. Conservative Monday Club member Lady Jane Birdwood was General Secretary. By 1974, the British League of Rights became the British chapter of the World Anti-Communist League, replacing Geoffrey Stewart-Smith&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Circle, which claimed to have left due to the Anti-Communist League&#x27;s antisemitism. In 1975, the British League established an association with the Britons Publishing Company. Although not officially connected, the League of Rights had links to the National Front and during the leadership of John Tyndall articles that appeared in League of Rights publications were regularly reprinted in Tyndall&#x27;s organ &quot;Spearhead&quot;.

The British League of Rights hosted the fourth Crown Commonwealth League of Rights conference in 1985.

Don Martin elected to resign from the chairmanship of the Policy Unit of the Federation of Small Businesses in 2001 as a result of a campaign by Gerry Gable&#x27;s &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine.

<text>The Félix Award ( is an award, given by the &quot;Association du disque, de l&#x27;industrie du spectacle québécois&quot; (ADISQ) on an annual basis to artists working in the music and humor industry in the Canadian province of Quebec.

==The award==

The first Félix awards were presented on September 23, 1979. The idea belonged to the first president of ADISQ, Gilles Talbot. The award trophy was created by Marc-André Parisé.

The awards are named in honour of Quebec songwriter Félix Leclerc.

In contrast to the Juno Awards, whose nominations are based partially on record sales, nominations and winners of the Félix are decided by ADISQ members. The awards are given during an annual ceremony &quot;Gala de l&#x27;ADISQ&quot;. Among the categories are Best-selling album, Best album (in various music genres), Songwriter of the year, Composer of the year, Song of the year, Male/Female singer of the year, Discovery of the year, Show of the year, etc.

The awards have sometimes been controversial. In 1983, songwriter Luc Plamondon attracted controversy by using his acceptance speech to denounce copyright law. In 1991, Céline Dion publicly refused the Félix for anglophone artist of the year for her English-language album &quot;Unison&quot;, not considering herself an anglophone artist. Instead she suggested to ADISQ to create a new award category for an artist who achieved the most success internationally. The next year such category was indeed created : Most successful artist performing in a language other than French (

<text>Summum is a religion and philosophy that began in 1975 as a result of American citizen Claude &quot;Corky&quot; Nowell&#x27;s claimed encounter with beings he described as &quot;Summa Individuals&quot;. According to Nowell, these beings presented him with concepts regarding the nature of creation, concepts that have always existed and are continually re-introduced to humankind by advanced beings who work along the pathways of creation. As a result of his experience, Nowell founded Summum in order to share the &quot;gift&quot; he received with others.
In 1980, as a reflection of his newfound path, he changed his name to Summum Bonum Amon Ra,
but news stories indicate he went by Corky Ra.
Summum religious practices draw upon both Ancient Egyptian religion and the Hebrew prophet Moses.

== Basis of the philosophy ==

Summum&#x27;s philosophy stems from what it considers to be principles of nature that cannot be attributed to any person.
These principles flower in different forms and were outlined before in the writings of &quot;The Kybalion&quot; first published in 1908.
But Summum, considering &quot;The Kybalion&quot; incomplete and antiquated, rewrote the book after it entered the public domain.
The new derivative work utilized a more modern language and incorporated the new information said to have been presented to Ra by the Summa Individuals. Included in that information is an explanation and description of how creation came about. The rewrite resulted in a book published by Summum entitled &quot;SUMMUM: Sealed Except to the Open Mind&quot;, and it provides an outline of the group&#x27;s philosophy. The basis of the philosophy is the &quot;Grand Principle of Creation&quot; that states, &quot;Nothing and Possibility come in and out of bond infinite times in a finite moment&quot;. The principle of creation generates the totality of existence which the Summum philosophy refers to as &quot;SUMMUM&quot;, and from this master principle emanate &quot;Seven Summum Principles&quot; known as Psychokinesis, Correspondence, Vibration, Opposition, Rhythm, Cause and Effect, and Gender.

Summum states that its teachings are the same as the teachings of Gnostic Christianity and maintains that knowledge does not come from things such as the intellect or obedience or faith, but from revelatory experience.
Summum teaches the &quot;Systematic Law of Learning&quot; which explains that knowledge is attained through questioning and experience.
According to Summum, devotion and spiritual practice leads to revelatory experience, and that was the basis of the authentic teachings of Jesus.

== Etymology and philosophical meaning ==

The word &quot;summum&quot; is Latin and is the neuter form of &quot;summus&quot; which means &quot;highest&quot;.

In the context of the Summum philosophy, &quot;summum&quot; means &quot;the sum total of all creation&quot;.
Summum appears to distinguish between &quot;Summum&quot; and &quot;SUMMUM&quot; in that &quot;Summum&quot; is the name of an organization and philosophy while &quot;SUMMUM&quot; is a name given to the totality of existence.

== Meditation ==

Practice of the religion involves meditation upon the aspect of creation that is within one&#x27;s self. Summum believes that within all created things is an essence which is the spirit of the creator, and that the more one directs his or her attention to this indwelling spirit, the more one realizes its existence and moves along the lines of spiritual progression, developing &quot;spiritual Psychokinesis&quot;. It appears that there is no recognized deity per se in the philosophy, but rather that people are all part of the mind of the universe and that the universe collectively constitutes something great and worthy of study and meditation.

According to Summum, our mental states dictate our sense of harmony and disharmony, and the resulting experiences become part of our memories that then hold us captive.

== Nectar Publications ==

Summum produces &quot;Nectar Publications&quot;, which are wines used in the meditation practices that Summum teaches. The nectars are made inside the Summum Pyramid, and according to Summum are imbued with resonations that contain spiritual concepts. Summum has made a number of different types of nectars, each containing its own &quot;message&quot;. A small amount of nectar is consumed prior to meditation, and the alcohol is said to carry the resonations across the blood–brain barrier where they are released in the brain. Perception of the nectars&#x27; effects is said to depend upon the awareness of the person using them.

Governmental authorities consider the nectars to be wine and required that Summum obtain a winery license in order to make them. Summum is Utah&#x27;s first federally bonded winery.

== Mummification ==

Summum practices &quot;Modern Mummification&quot; and &quot;Transference&quot; as a means to guide one&#x27;s essence to a greater destination following the death of the body.
Summum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation sole that was granted a religious exemption from the IRS for its mummification service. The service is available to anyone for spiritual reasons and is also offered for pets. Summum does request and accept donations.
The process has been featured in programs produced by &quot;National Geographic&quot; and the British Broadcasting Corporation.

The first person to undergo the mummification process was Nowell himself, who died in January 2008. His body is encased inside a bronze casket that is covered in gold and stands inside the group&#x27;s pyramid.

== Participants ==

According to its founder, over 250,000 people worldwide have &quot;received&quot; Summum instruction. As the organization does not keep formal membership records, this figure is based on the number of bottles of wine it has distributed.

== Ten Commandments ==

Summum contends that the principles and nature of creation are continuously re-introduced to humankind by evolved beings. The group holds that in one such case, Moses in the Old Testament was given both a &quot;lower&quot; and &quot;higher&quot; knowledge from a divine being. The lower knowledge was embodied in the more widely known Ten Commandments, while the higher was expressed in what Summum refers to as the &quot;Seven Aphorisms&quot;.
According to Summum, when Moses first descended from Mount Sinai, he had with him the higher law inscribed on stone tablets. However, the undeveloped condition of the Israelites prevented them from understanding. Moses returned to Mount Sinai and returned with another set of tablets containing the lower law that was much easier for the people to comprehend. The higher law was only shared with a few capable of understanding its meaning.
This appears to coincide with one of Summum&#x27;s precepts that states, &quot;The voice of wisdom is silent, except to the OPEN MIND&quot;, and in this aspect, Summum resembles an esoteric religious movement.

According to the group, the &quot;Seven Aphorisms&quot; are:
# SUMMUM is MIND, thought; the universe is a mental creation.
# As above, so below; as below, so above.
# Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.
# Everything is dual; everything has an opposing point; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes bond; all truths are but partial truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.
# Everything flows out and in; everything has its season; all things rise and fall; the pendulum swing expresses itself in everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates.
# Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause; everything happens according to Law; Chance is just a name for Law not recognized; there are many fields of causation, but nothing escapes the Law of Destiny.
# Gender is in everything; everything has its masculine and feminine principles; Gender manifests on all levels.

=== Freedom of speech ===

Summum followers have gained attention as of late in that they have proposed that their Seven Aphorisms be placed in public places alongside the Ten Commandments, specifically in several locations in Utah. Christians and town fathers have objected, claiming that the Ten Commandments are of great historic significance to the United States, and as such are not solely a religious statement, whereas the seven aphorisms are a modern philosophy. Summum has prevailed in other litigation where the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Summum was denied its right to free speech and governments had engaged in discrimination.
The governments in those cases elected to remove their Ten Commandments monument rather than allow Summum to erect its Seven Aphorisms monument. However, Pleasant Grove, Utah, was successful in getting the United States Supreme Court to hear their case. Their argument is that the acceptance of a monument is not an instance of a public forum where speakers may not be discriminated against, but rather a form of government speech that does not require neutral viewpoints.

On February 25, 2009, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously against Summum in the &quot;Pleasant Grove&quot; case. Justice Samuel Alito, in his opinion for the court, asserted that a municipality&#x27;s acceptance and acquisition of a privately funded permanent monument erected in a public park while refusing to accept other privately funded permanent memorials is a valid expression of governmental speech, which is permissible and not an unconstitutional interference with the First Amendment&#x27;s guarantee of free speech. According to Alito, &quot;the display of a permanent monument in a public park&quot; is perceived by an ordinary and reasonable observer to be an expression of values and ideas of the government, the owner of the park and the monument, even though the particular idea expressed by the monument is left to the interpretation of the individual observer. Alito made a clear distinction between forms of private speech in public parks, such as rallies and temporary holiday displays (Christmas trees and menorahs), and the government speech represented by permanent monuments. He opined that even long-winded speakers eventually go home with their leaflets and holiday displays are taken down; but permanent monuments endure and are obviously associated with their owners. Alito wrote, &quot;cities and other jurisdictions take some care in accepting donated monuments.&quot; While Summum and its supporters attempted to persuade the Court that preventing governments from selecting monuments on the basis of content would be tenable, Justice Alito noted that such a situation would put government in the position of having to choose between accepting permanent monuments with conflicting messages that do not represent the values and ideals of the community, and removing all monuments from public space. As described by Alito, if the law accorded with Summum and its supporters, New York would have been required to accept a Statue of Autocracy from the German Empire or Imperial Russia when it accepted the Statue of Liberty from France.

In a companion case, Summum requested a monument of its Seven Aphorisms be placed next to a Ten Commandments monument in Roy Park, a public park in the city of Duchesne, Utah. Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Pleasant Grove v. Summum&quot;, Summum claimed the ruling opened the door for a new challenge based on church-state separation claims. Unlike Pleasant Grove, the Duchesne Ten Commandments monument was the only one in the park. Duchesne decided to move the monument to the city cemetery to avoid continuing litigation, citing counsel from their attorney who said the solitary monument would establish a religion for the city. As a result of the monument&#x27;s removal from the city park, Summum&#x27;s lawsuit became moot and was dismissed.

== Summum Pyramid ==

The Summum Pyramid is a sanctuary and temple used by the organization of Summum for instruction in the Summum philosophy. It is located in Salt Lake City, Utah, and was built during 1977 to 1979. The pyramid is 40 feet long at the base, 26 feet high, and is oriented towards true north of the Earth. The structure also incorporates the Divine Proportion, or Golden Ratio, in its design.

<text>The M252 81 mm medium weight mortar is a British-designed smooth bore, muzzle-loading, high-angle-of-fire weapon used for long-range indirect fire support to light infantry, air assault, and airborne units across the entire front of a battalion zone of influence. In the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps, it is normally deployed in the mortar platoon of an infantry battalion.

==Design==

The M252 system weighs completely assembled and is composed of the M253 Cannon (), M177 Mount (), M3A1 Baseplate (), and the M64A1 Sight Unit (). The mount consists of a base plate and a bipod, which is provided with screw type elevating and traversing mechanisms to elevate/traverse the mortar. The M64A1 sight unit (also used on the M224) is attached to the bipod mount. The M252 is a gravity-fired smoothbore system. Attached to the muzzle of the weapon is the Blast Attenuation Device (BAD), used to reduce the blast effects on the mortar crew. To increase cooling efficiency, the breech end is finned; though first-hand accounts attest that the level of cooling is negligible. The cannon also has a crew-removable breech plug and firing pin.

High explosive rounds fired by the M252 weigh and can have an effective kill radius of .

In 2017, the Marines revealed they were developing precision-guided rounds for the 81 mm mortar, similar to efforts for the 120 mm Expeditionary Fire Support System but in a man-portable system.

==History==
The M252 is an adaptation of the British 81mm L16A2 mortar developed in the 1950s. It entered service with the U.S. Army and replaced the previous 81 mm M29 mortar in 1987. It was adopted due to the extended range () and enhanced lethality. In the U.S. it is produced by Watervliet Arsenal.
A lightweight version, the M252A1 was first fielded in December 2014. By using lightweight materials such as aluminum, titanium and nylon kevlar the total weight was reduced by to . The M252A1 also required less maintenance with its grease-less internal gears. The M252A1 was scheduled to replace the M252 in 2016. In November 2016, the Watervliet Arsenal received a contract to produce the bipods which have an A-shaped bipod frame with deliveries to be completed by March 2020. As part of the same program, a lightweight version of the M224 60mm mortar the M224A1 was also developed. The Marines developed an improved M252A2 version that weighs about less than the original and incorporates a 4× magnification sight with a new cooling system.

==Operation==
===Crew===
A crew of five enlisted personnel operate the M252: the squad leader, the gunner, the assistant gunner, the first ammunition bearer, and the second ammunition bearer.

# The squad leader stands directly behind the mortar where they can command and control their squad. In addition to having general oversight of all squad activities, they also supervise the emplacement, laying, and firing of the weapon.
# The gunner stands to the left of the mortar where they can manipulate the sight, traversing handwheel, and elevating handwheel. They place firing data on the sight and lays the mortar for deflection and elevation. They make large deflection shifts by shifting the bipod assembly and keep the bubbles level during firing.
# The assistant gunner stands to the right of the mortar, facing the barrel and ready to load. In addition to loading, they swab the bore after 10 rounds have been fired or after each fire mission. The assistant gunner is the person who actually fires the weapon.
# The first ammunition bearer stands to the right rear of the mortar. They have the duty of preparing the ammunition (charge settings, fuzes, etc...) and passing it to the assistant gunner.
# The second ammunition bearer stands to the right rear of the mortar behind the first ammunition bearer. They maintain and keep a record of the ammunition in addition to the data corresponding to each fire mission. Their twofold records include a written table of firing data, type, and number of rounds fired, and the safety pins pulled from each round to provide physical evidence to the accuracy of the table. In addition they provide local security for the mortar position.

===Types of rounds===

While the M252 does fire a weapon-specific series of ammunition, it can also fire rounds from the M29 Mortar (only at charge 3 or below though). The M252 Mortar can fire the following principal classifications of training and service ammunition:
* High explosive (HE): Designations M821, M821A1, M889, M889A1, M372-series, and M362. Used against personnel and light materiel targets.
** Advanced Capability Extended Range Mortar (ACERM): Developmental guided round that adds wings, control fins, GPS navigation, a laser seeker, and an enhanced warhead; increases accuracy to within one meter and can reach a range of in five minutes. ACERM variations include a 120mm version with range, an 81mm extreme performance configuration with a range, a 5 inch naval gun configuration, including other gun systems, and an air dropped glide bomb version for delivery within a six times the altitude radius. 
* Smoke Cartridge: Designations M819 and M375-series. Used as a screening, signaling, or marking munition.
* Illumination (ILLUM)
** VIS ILLUM. Designations M853A1 and M301-series. Used in night missions requiring illumination for assistance in observation.
** IR ILLUM. Designation M816. Provides an aerial parachuting Infrared Illuminating round for use with Infrared Night Vision Equipment.
** Non-Lethal Indirect Fire Munition: Developmental round based on the M853A1 that disperses flash bang submunitions to temporarily daze people.
* Practice (PRAC): Designations M880, M879, M68, and sabot. Used for training in limited areas.
* Infrared Illumination (IR): Produces illumination which is only visible through the use of night vision devices.

===Fuzes===
The M252 rounds have three fuze types: the Multi-option Fuze (MOF) M734, the Mechanical Time &amp; Super Quick (MTSQ) M772 and the Point-Detonating (PD) Fuze M935. The M734 is used for the M720 HE round and can be set to function as proximity burst, near-surface burst, impact burst, or delay burst, the M772 is used for the IR &amp; VIS ILLUM (M816, M853A1) to activate the Illum candle during the rounds height point of its trajectory; the elevation and charge will determine the time set on the fuze.

===Method of propulsion===

The range of a mortar is controlled by the number of propellant charges attached to the tail of the mortar designated M223. A charge is a semi-circular donut of nitrocellulose, which resembles a &quot;horseshoe&quot;. A round for the M252 mortar comes with four charges attached. Longer-range shots require more propellant than can fit in the tail of the round, hence the necessity of external charges. 

When the target is ranged, a mortar team member adjusts the amount of propellant by removing horseshoe charges from the projectile. The mortar squad leader verifies the number of charges; then the assistant gunner drops the round down the muzzle of the tube. The round, pulled by gravity, accelerates down the smooth bore of the mortar until the primer (in the base of the tail boom of the round) strikes the firing pin located in the bottom of the mortar tail assembly. The primer detonates, igniting the charge in the tail fin, which in turn ignites the horseshoes charges on the round. The charges deflagrate, releasing hot, expanding gas which pushes against the round with the obturating ring on the projectile, sealing the gas behind the projectile.
The pressure from the expanding gas accelerates the projectile until it leaves the end of the tube.

<text>Tralfamadore is the name of a fictional planet appearing in the novels of Kurt Vonnegut in inconsistently described variations. It is variously depicted as being located outside of the Milky Way galaxy or being fictional within the fiction itself.

== Appearances ==

*In the 1959 novel &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot;, Tralfamadore is a planet in the Small Magellanic Cloud and the home of a civilization of machines, who had long ago superseded their organic builders when those let themselves be exterminated for having no discernible higher purpose. A central plot revolves around a Tralfamadorian messenger &quot;stranded on Titan&quot; who takes &quot;control of human history in order to transmit a message home requesting a spare part for his spaceship.&quot;
*In the 1965 novel &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;, Tralfamadore is referenced as a fictional location made up by Kilgore Trout, a recurring character in Vonnegut&#x27;s works.
*In the 1969 novel &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, Tralfamadore is the home to organic beings who can see into all times, and are thus privy to knowledge of future events. Lawrence R. Broer described both them and their counterparts from &quot;Sirens&quot; as &quot;ludicrous-looking&quot;. Science-fiction scholar Brian Stableford suggested that Tralfamadore here exists in a different fictional universe than the planet referred to in &quot;Sirens of Titan&quot;, but where the original organic inhabitants have not died out. Protagonist Billy Pilgrim, dealing with the trauma from experiencing the bombing of Dresden, relates how he is kidnapped by Tralfamadorians, leaving ambiguous if the planet exists in the novel or just in the character&#x27;s imagination. In a similar role to &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;, Tralfamadore for Pilgrim is a place &quot;where the problematic aspects of his earthly existence are all nicely resolved.&quot; Lawrence R. Broer observed that &quot;Tralfamadore&quot; is an anagram for &quot;Or Fatal Dream&quot;, which is fitting as its inhabitants follow fatalistic ideas that guide Billy Pilgrim down into &quot;his schizophrenic descent into madness&quot;.
*In the 1990 book &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;, Tralfamadore appears again in a fiction within the fiction, published in a pornographic magazine. As in &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot;, the Tralfamadorians disrupt the history of humankind, here in favor of bacteria which they view as more valuable. Salman Rushdie remarked that this has the effect that &quot;it makes a person feel pretty darn small&quot;.
* In the 1997 novel &quot;Timequake&quot;, Tralfamadore is mentioned as a fantastical meeting place of anthropomorphized chemical elements, who, like the Tralfamadorians from other works, were &quot;higher level beings&quot; and happier than humans, considering them a &quot;peerlessly cruel and oafish species&quot;.

== Analysis ==
Tralfamadore&#x27;s inhabitants are described inconsistently across different works. Robert Tally compared this to Vonnegut&#x27;s habit of (re-)introducing characters that have the same names as characters in previous works, but where the details do not match. Tally concluded that Vonnegut—unlike e.g. J. R. R. Tolkien—was not interested in creating an internally consistent fictional universe across his oeuvre, but content with a broad-strokes approach.

A recurring characteristic of the inhabitants of Tralfamadore is their low esteem of humanity. Brian Stableford, considering the examples of &quot;Sirens of Titan&quot; and &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, described the different Tralfamadorian races themselves as &quot;tiny-minded smartasses&quot; rendered impotent by their fatalistic worldview. Vonnegut scholar Julia A. Whitehead saw the overall concept of Tralfamadore throughout the author&#x27;s work as in &quot;many ways [...] his own Eden&quot;, an escapist imagined home of happier beings. In her view the presentation of the Tralfamadorians with their deeper insights into &quot;the science of nature [...] was Vonnegut&#x27;s way of telling readers that humans don&#x27;t know enough about each other and other life forms.&quot;

<text>Balta (; Old Norse: &quot;Baltey&quot;) is an uninhabited island in Shetland, Scotland.

==Geography==
Balta lies off the east coast of Unst and Balta Sound. It has an area of .

There is a natural arch on the eastern side of the island.

Balta Island Seafare and Skaw Smolts are the most northerly fish farm and fish hatchery in Britain.

==History==
Historic remains on the island include the ruins of a broch and of a Norse chapel dedicated to Saint Sunniva. There are no census records of more recent inhabitation.

John MacCulloch visited Balta in May 1820 to carry out the Trigonometrical Survey for the Ordnance Survey. Balta was the northernmost station of the zenith sector.

==Lighthouse==
The Balta Light, at the southern tip of the island was one of the first concrete structures in Shetland. The lighthouse was designed by David Stevenson and built in 1895. It was demolished in 2003 and replaced by a small solar-powered light.

<text>Civil Assistance was a British far-right movement in the 1970s, purporting to be a non-governmental civil defence group. It was a voluntary group that aimed to break any planned general strike. It was founded in 1974 by retired General Sir Walter Walker, Commander in Chief of NATO forces in Northern Europe from 1969 to 1972. It was a spin-off of Unison, a civil defence group founded in 1973 by George Kennedy Young, a former deputy director of MI6.

In August 1974 Walker claimed that Civil Assistance had 100,000 members. This provoked the then Labour Defence Secretary, Roy Mason, to interrupt his holiday to release a statement complaining of a &#x27;near fascist groundswell&#x27;. Then on 25 February 1975 Walker addressed a meeting of around a hundred Civil Assistance members at St Lawrence Jewry in the City of London. The Communist newspaper the &quot;Morning Star&quot; claimed to have infiltrated the meeting and to have counted one general, nine colonels and six brigadiers and seven other former officers. Walker supposedly made a speech calling the British Left a &#x27;cancer&#x27;, organisers of political strikes &#x27;traitors&#x27; and Labour MPs subversives. Walker claimed Civil Assistance would &#x27;act&#x27; against these and that its members had &#x27;excellent relationships with chief constables&#x27;.

Shortly before this speech Margaret Thatcher became Leader of the Conservative Party and Civil Assistance gradually faded from the media.

<text>The Royal Canal () is a canal originally built for freight and passenger transportation from Dublin to Longford in Ireland. It is one of two canals from Dublin to the River Shannon and was built in direct competition to the Grand Canal. The canal fell into disrepair in the late 20th century, but much of it has since been restored for navigation. The length of the canal to the River Shannon was reopened on 1 October 2010, but a final spur branch, to Longford Town, remains closed.

==History==

===Construction===

In 1755, Thomas Williams and John Cooley made a survey to find a suitable route for a man-made waterway across north Leinster from Dublin to the Shannon. They originally planned to use a series of rivers and lakes, including the Boyne, Blackwater, Deel, Yellow, Camlin and Inny and Lough Derravaragh. A disgruntled director of the Grand Canal Company sought support to build a canal from Dublin to Cloondara, on the Shannon in West County Longford.

Work on this massive project commenced in May 1790 at Cross Guns Bridge, Phibsborough in a westerly direction towards Ashtown. This is commemorated in the plaque beneath the keystone of Ranelagh Bridge. Twenty-seven years later, in 1817, the canal reached the Shannon. The total cost of construction was £1,421,954. Building was unexpectedly expensive, and the project was riven with problems; in 1794 the Royal Canal Company was declared bankrupt. The Duke of Leinster, a board member, insisted that the new waterway take in his local town of Maynooth. The builders had to deviate from the planned route and necessitated the construction of a &#x27;deep sinking&#x27; between Blanchardstown and Clonsilla. The diversion also called for the building of the Ryewater Aqueduct, at Leixlip.

===Operation===

In 1796, the canal reached Kilcock and trade commenced. Two passenger boats, the &quot;Camden&quot; and the &quot;Phelan&quot;, went into service on 2 December 1796, with a fare of 1s-1d (first class cabin) or 6d (second class cabin) from Dublin to Leixlip, a journey of approximately 20km. This was much cheaper than the stagecoach at the time, which cost 8s-8d for the same journey. Passengers also had the option to dine onboard the canal passenger boat, whereas this was not possible on the coach, which made a slow canal journey such as the 12 hours to Mullingar more manageable. 
In the early 1800s, the canal supplied water to Dublin Corporation for its north city water supply, which could make the water level drop on the canal at times, especially during dry summers. To counteract this, a small reservoir named after King George III was opened in the north inner city in 1809, paid for by Dublin Corporation, which was fed from the 1km-long spur that came off the Royal Canal to meet Broadstone railway station near Phibsborough. The ground alone, covering merely an acre, cost the Corporation £1,052-9s-2d. The reservoir still exists, named the Blessington Street Basin, although the spur has been filled in.

In the late 1820s, as the quality of roads in Ireland improved, road carriers such as Bianconi&#x27;s Coach and Car Service began to compete with the canal as an affordable alternate public transport option. 

By the 1830s the canal carried 80,000 tons of freight and 40,000 passengers a year.
 In 1843, while walking with his wife along the Royal Canal, Sir William Rowan Hamilton realised the formula for quaternions and carved his initial thoughts into a stone on the Broom Bridge over the canal. The annual Hamilton Walk commemorates this event. 

In July 1845, the Midland Great Western Railway company was formed by a parliamentary act, authorising it to build a railway from Dublin to and and to purchase the Royal Canal, which they did that same year. They considered draining the canal and building a new railway along its bed, however they were &quot;legally obliged to operate the canal as a separate transport system and so it (the Royal Canal) continued to operate&quot;. The train line was eventually laid adjacent to the canal, and the two run side by side from Dublin to Mullingar.

15 passengers, including two children, were drowned in an incident on the canal, near Clonsilla, Dublin on 25 November 1845. At approximately 4:00pm on 25 November that year, the Royal Canal Company passenger boat &quot;Longford&quot;, on its way from Dublin to Longford, was steered accidentally into the bank, turned over (with the weight of 54 passengers suddenly thrown to one side), and capsized. 

In May 1847, during the Great Famine, tenants of Major Denis Mahon, left his Strokestown Park estate in County Roscommon. The tenants, who would become known locally as the &quot;Missing 1,490&quot;, had been offered a choice of emigration with assisted passage, starvation on their blighted potato farms or a place in the local workhouse. Weakened by starvation, the 1,490 walked for days along the towpaths of the Royal Canal to Dublin, where they were put on boats to Liverpool, and from there travelled to Grosse Île, Quebec on four &quot;coffin ships&quot; – cargo vessels that were also, ironically, loaded with grain from Ireland, and were unsuitable for passengers. It is estimated that half of the emigrants died before reaching Grosse Île. This was the largest single exodus of tenants during the Famine. Mahon was assassinated in November 1847, after news reached Roscommon about the fate of his former tenants. An annual walk on the canal banks commemorates these events.

Competition from the railways gradually eroded the canal&#x27;s business and by the 1880s annual tonnage was down to about 30,000 and the passenger traffic had all but disappeared.

It had a brief resurgence during World War II, when horses and barges returned to the canal. CIÉ took over the canal in 1944. As rail and road traffic increased, the canal fell into disuse. In 1951, one boat was left using the canal commercially, which ceased in July of that year. A decade later, in 1961, CIÉ closed the navigation on the canal, and placed a dam across it &quot;three miles west of Mullingar, thereby cutting off the main water supply to the western section&quot;.

In 1974, volunteers from the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland formed the Royal Canal Amenity Group to save the canal. By 1990 they had 74 kilometres of canal, from the 12th lock in Blanchardstown to Mullingar, open again for navigation. In 2000, the canal was taken over by Waterways Ireland, a cross-border body charged with administering Ireland&#x27;s inland navigations. On 1 October 2010, the whole length of the canal was formally reopened.

==Management==
Since the early 19th century, the canal has been maintained by eight successive agencies: the Royal Canal Company, the Commissioners of Inland Navigation, the New Royal Canal Company, Midland Great Western Railway Company, Great Southern Railways, CIÉ, the Office of Public Works (from 1986), and Waterways Ireland, in addition to the restoration and maintenance by the volunteers of the Royal Canal Amenity Group.

==Route==
The canal passes through Maynooth, Kilcock, Enfield, Longwood, Mullingar and Ballymahon has a spur to Longford. The total length of the main navigation is , and the system has 46 locks. There is one main feeder (from Lough Owel), which enters the canal at Mullingar.

=== Transport links ===
The Royal Canal was originally planned to terminate in Dublin at Broadstone, to serve the then fashionable area of residence, as well as King&#x27;s Inns and the nearby markets, but it was extended so that now, at the Dublin end, the canal reaches the Liffey through a wide sequence of dock and locks at Spencer Dock, with a final sea lock to manage access to the river and sea.

The Dublin – Mullingar railway line was built alongside the canal for much of its length. The meandering route of the canal resulted in many speed-limiting curves on the railway. The canal was bought by the Midland Great Western Railway to provide a route to the West of Ireland, the original plan being to close the canal and build the railway along its bed.

The canal travels across one of the major junctions on the M50 where it meets the N3, in a specially constructed aqueduct.

== Present day ==
Today Waterways Ireland is responsible for the canal, and it was under their stewardship, in association with the Royal Canal Amenity Group, that the Royal Canal was officially reopened from Dublin to the Shannon on 2 October 2010. Access points currently exist near Leixlip and at Maynooth, Enfield, Thomastown, Mullingar, Ballinea Bridge and Ballynacargy.

In 2006, a commemoration marker was erected at Piper&#x27;s Boreen, Mullingar, to mark the 200 years since the canal reached Mullingar in 1806.

==Royal Canal Way==

The Royal Canal Way is a long-distance trail that follows the towpath of the canal from Ashtown, Dublin to Cloondara, County Longford. It is typically completed in six days. It is designated as a National Waymarked Trail by the National Trails Office of the Irish Sports Council and is managed by Waterways Ireland. In 2015, Dublin City Council began extending the walking and cycling route along the Royal Canal from Ashtown to Sheriff Street Upper. The Royal Canal Way connects with the Westmeath Way west of Mullingar and will eventually form the eastern end of the Dublin-Galway Greenway, the final part of EuroVelo Route 2, a cycling path from Moscow across Europe to Galway.

The Royal Canal Greenway is the greenway encompassing the Royal Canal Way between Maynooth and Cloondara, with a branch to Longford. It was launched in March 2021.

==Popular culture==

=== The Auld Triangle ===
The Royal Canal was immortalised in verse by Brendan Behan in &quot;The Auld Triangle&quot;. A monument featuring Behan sitting on a bench was erected on the canal bank at Binn&#x27;s Bridge in Drumcondra in 2004.

:&quot;And the auld triangle went jingle jangle,&quot;
:&quot;All along the banks of the Royal Canal.&quot;

== Superstition ==
Royal Canal boatmen believed the 13th lock at Deey Bridge, between Leixlip and Maynooth, was haunted. This tale became the subject of a poem by Arthur Griffith, &quot;The Spooks of the Thirteenth Lock&quot;, which in turn inspired the name of the band &quot;The Spook of the Thirteenth Lock&quot;.

<doc id="614354" wikidata="Q750265" url="?curid=614354" title="Maynooth">
<text>Maynooth (; ) is a university town in north County Kildare, Ireland. It is home to Maynooth University (part of the National University of Ireland and also known as the National University of Ireland, Maynooth) and St Patrick&#x27;s College, a Pontifical University and Ireland&#x27;s sole Roman Catholic seminary. Maynooth is also the seat of the Irish Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference and holds the headquarters of Ireland&#x27;s largest development charity, Trócaire. Maynooth is located 24 kilometres (15 miles) west of central Dublin.

==Location and access==
Maynooth is located on the R148 road between Leixlip and Kilcock, with the M4 motorway bypassing the town. Other roads connect the town to Celbridge, Clane, and Dunboyne. Maynooth is also on the Dublin-Sligo railway line and is served by the Commuter and InterCity train services.

==Etymology==
Maynooth comes or &quot;Maigh Nuadhad&quot;, meaning &quot;plain of Nuadha&quot;. &quot;Maigh Nuad&quot; is the modern spelling. Nuadha was one of the gods of the ancient Irish, corresponding to Nudd of Wales and Nodens of ancient Britain and Gaul.

==History==
===Historical governance===

Maynooth was a long-term centre for the Geraldine or FitzGerald family, which dominated Irish affairs during the Anglo-Norman and Tudor periods.

From 1932 to 1937, the town was the unofficial home to the King&#x27;s representative in Ireland, Governor General Domhnall Ua Buachalla, who declined to take up official residence in the Viceregal Lodge in the Phoenix Park, and whose family operated a hardware store in the town until 2005.

===Historical features===

The town is just inside the western edge of The Pale. It has, at either end of the main street, Maynooth Castle and Carton House, two former seats of the Dukes of Leinster. The castle was a stronghold of the 16th century historical figure Thomas FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Kildare who was better known as Silken Thomas. The castle was overrun in 1535, after the rebellion of the Earl.

The most important historical buildings in the town are those of St. Patrick&#x27;s College and some which antedate the foundation of the college, while others are in the late Georgian and neo-Gothic revival style. The &quot;new range&quot; of buildings was erected by A. W. N. Pugin in 1850 under a commission from then college president Laurence F. Renehan, while the College Chapel was designed and completed by James Joseph McCarthy during the presidency of Robert Browne in 1894.

Conolly&#x27;s Folly is within Maynooth&#x27;s extensive town boundaries.

There are three old monastic settlements in the vicinity of Maynooth, including Laraghbryan and its cemetery, Taghadoe and its Round Tower and Grangewilliam (Donaghmore).

Maynooth Pound is a rare example of a surviving pound which has existed since the 18th century. The existing walls were built in 1822 although the pound is older than that. Historically, stray animals were impounded here to be returned to their owners for a fee or sold at auction if not claimed. More recently the pound was renovated and is now a place of recreation by the Lyreen River.

==Population==

The population of 17,259 (according to the census in 2022) makes Maynooth the fourth largest settlement in County Kildare and the 29th largest settlement in Ireland. However, during the academic year the population of Maynooth nearly doubles in size. Measurement can be difficult as much of the population is transient – students at Maynooth University (above 12,000) or St. Patrick&#x27;s College, or temporary employees at the nearby Intel and Hewlett Packard Enterprise facilities (both located in Leixlip).

==Education==

There are two third-level educational institutions – St Patrick&#x27;s College, founded under King George III in 1795 to train Ireland&#x27;s Roman Catholic clergy, and Maynooth University, separated from St. Patrick&#x27;s College in 1997 – located in the town. They share campus space and many facilities.

There are two secondary schools (Maynooth Post Primary &amp; Maynooth Community College, run from the same premises by Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board), and five primary schools: a Presentation Sisters girls-only school, a Dublin Archdiocese boys-only school (St. Mary&#x27;s BNS), an Educate Together school, a Dublin Archdiocese Irish-language school and an An Foras Pátrúnachta multi-denominational Irish-language primary school, currently co-located with the other Irish-language school.

A KWETB Irish-language secondary school opened in September 2020.

==Amenities==
The town contains a fire station, in addition to the area&#x27;s part-time Garda station, a health centre, a public library, and a credit union as well as various restaurants, including &quot;Romayo&#x27;s&quot; which was voted to be the best Take-Away in Leinster in 2014.
Maynooth Community Library hosts regular public events, including book clubs, a film club, children&#x27;s storytime, and author visits. It also offers services and events relating to National Healthy Ireland and Work Matters initiatives.

==Churches==
Maynooth is served by two churches named St. Mary&#x27;s, one St. Mary&#x27;s Church of Ireland (Anglican) which is incorporated into the walls of St. Patrick&#x27;s College, and St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, where the Kilcock Road turns into Maynooth Village, serving the Maynooth Parish of St. Mary&#x27;s and Lady chapel. Also close by is the former Moyglare Church which is used as the Church of Ireland, Meath &amp; Kildare Diocesan Centre. Maynooth Community Church, a congregation linked to the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, has applied for planning permission to construct a church.

==Economy==
The town is the main retail and service centre for North Kildare and South Meath, with several supermarkets as well as a wide variety of non-chain stores.

In October 2005, Dunnes Stores opened a major shopping centre off the town&#x27;s main street, &quot;Manor Mills&quot;. This centre contains a number of other high street shops.

Carton House is a five-star hotel located on the outskirts of Maynooth. In 2020, it was announced that the hotel would be managed by the Fairmont hospitality group.

==Transport==
===Canal===

When the Royal Canal was designed in 1790, with a planned length of 175 km, with 76 locks, 65 aqueducts and 85 bridges, it was intended to pass north of the town of Maynooth. However the Duke of Leinster contributed £1,000 towards the cost of the £200,000 undertaking and insisted that his town would be served by the canal. Maynooth has a canal harbour, and the canal is navigable from central Dublin to this point and onwards to Clondara, County Longford. It is now mostly used mostly for leisure and drainage purposes but historically was used for passengers and freight (grain, potatoes, coal and coke, manure, turf, bricks, stone, sand, timber, and general merchandise) and Maynooth&#x27;s canal harbour provided a stopping point before Dublin. When the railways arrived, passengers transferred to the quicker rail service.

The harbour, known locally as &quot;Duke&#x27;s Harbour&quot;, is roughly triangular in shape and on the north side of the canal, opposite the railway station, is a popular fishing area.

===Rail===
Maynooth railway station is one of the busiest in the Dublin / Kildare region, as it serves two major educational institutions and is a major commuter town for people working in Dublin. The town is the terminus of most Iarnród Éireann Western Commuter trains, as well as being served by the Dublin-Sligo InterCity service.

In December 2019, Iarnród Éireann awarded a contract for Multi-Disciplinary Consultancy Team for the expansion of the Dublin Area Rapid Transit on the Maynooth Line which will lead to electrification of the line to Maynooth and increase capacity on the line.

===Bus===
Dublin Bus operates routes C3, C4 and the night buses C5 and C6, from Maynooth to Ringsend in Dublin. Go-Ahead Ireland operates the W61, which links Maynooth to the Hazelhatch and Celbridge Railway Station. Bus Éireann services 22 (Ballina to Dublin Airport), 23 (Sligo to Dublin Airport) and 115 (Mullingar/Kilcock to Dublin) serve the town, as well as Aircoach&#x27;s route 706/706X (Galway to Dublin Airport). Passengers may travel from Maynooth westbound or to Dublin Airport. Airport Hopper route 767 provides an additional higher frequency link to Dublin Airport.

JJ Kavanagh/National Transport Authority route 139 links Naas to Blanchardstown via Maynooth. A number of private operators also serve the town, linking it with nearby towns and cities; many in college term-time only.

==Sport and voluntary groups==
===Golf===
Carton House Golf Club is located in Maynooth. The Golfing Union of Ireland, the longest established golf union in the world, have their national headquarters on the estate. This facility also comprises the GUI National Academy, a 22-acre (89,000 m) teaching facility. It has a driving range, putting green, and short game area, as well as lessons.

===GAA===
Maynooth GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club and has competed in the senior football championship in Kildare since 2009.

===Soccer===
Maynooth Town F.C. is the local soccer club. The senior men&#x27;s team competes in co-operation with Maynooth University as Maynooth University Town F.C., a member of the Leinster Senior League. They won the FAI Intermediate Cup in 2018 and hence now compete in the senior FAI Cup. They progressed to the second round of the 2018 tournament. They reached the FAI Cup quarter-final in 2021 for the first time. They were beaten 4–0 in the quarter final by Bohemians F.C.

===Rugby===
North Kildare RFC is the local rugby club and is situated about 3 km from Maynooth on the Kilcock road. Maynooth native Bob Casey (born 1978) was a professional rugby player and a senior Irish international.

Maynooth University and the Leixlip based Barnhall Rugby Club merged in 2010 and renamed to MU Barnhall RFC in 2015, fielding 28 teams both male and female from U7 to Senior All-Ireland League.

===Equestrian===
Maynooth is home to the thoroughbred horse racing and breeding operation, Moyglare Stud Farm.

===Basketball===
North Kildare Eagles Basketball Club is based in Maynooth. The club runs an academy for kids aged 5-10, juvenile teams for girls and boys aged 11-18, and Basketball4All for children with disabilities. Juvenile teams compete in competitions run by the Midlands Area Basketball Board.

===Cycling===
There are two cycling clubs based in Maynooth. Maynooth Cycling Club is sponsored by and runs out of Maynooth Cycles in Newtown Shopping Centre. The other is Maynooth Students for Charity, also known as the Galway Cycle. This club runs out of Maynooth University, and from January to April culminating in a charity cycle to Galway and back over a weekend. The club has raised over 1 million euro for charity since its inception.

===Scouting===
The Maynooth Scout group has been in existence since 1975. After many years operating out of the Maynooth Post Primary school they restored and redeveloped the Geraldine Hall, a protected building, as their Den in 2013.=

==International relations==

Maynooth has a town twinning agreement with Canet-en-Roussillon in France.

<doc id="614356" wikidata="Q250343" url="?curid=614356" title="Jim Jackson (basketball)">
<text>James Arthur Jackson (born October 14, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player. Over his 14 National Basketball Association (NBA) seasons, Jackson was on the active roster of 12 different teams, which was an NBA record shared with Joe Smith, Tony Massenburg, Chucky Brown, and Ish Smith; until Ish played with the Denver Nuggets, his 13th team, in the 2022–23 season. He is currently a basketball analyst for Fox Sports, Turner Sports and the Los Angeles Clippers on Bally Sports West, having previously worked for the Big Ten Network. Jim Jackson also works as an analyst for the NBA Playoffs on NBATV.
==High school career==
Jackson was a 6&#x27;6&quot; (198 cm), shooting guard who started all four years at Macomber High School in Toledo, Ohio. The former McDonald&#x27;s All American led Macomber to the 1989 Division I state championship over Cleveland St. Joseph. He was high school teammates with former NFL safety Myron Bell.

==College career==
Jackson was a member of the Ohio State Buckeyes. He instantly contributed, starting as a freshman for the 1989–90 season and averaging 16.1 points and 5.5 rebounds per game while shooting 49.9% from the field. He played two more seasons through the 1991–92 season, earning consensus First Team All American honors in 1991 and 1992 UPI college basketball, the UPI player of the year, and winning the Big Ten Championship in 1992.

Jackson&#x27;s number (22) was retired at Ohio State in February 2001.

==NBA career==

===Dallas Mavericks===
Jackson skipped his final year of college eligibility and was drafted by the Dallas Mavericks with the fourth overall pick of the 1992 NBA draft after his junior season at OSU.

Jackson&#x27;s rookie year was abbreviated due to a lengthy contract dispute where he held out for most of the season. As a result, he appeared in only 28 games in his first season in the league. He started in all 82 games the following season, averaging 19.2 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.6 assists in 37.4 minutes per game. With the drafting of Jamal Mashburn and Jason Kidd in the following two seasons, the trio was nicknamed the &quot;Three J&#x27;s&quot;.

During the 1994–95 season, Jackson averaged 25.7 points and 5.1 rebounds, finishing fifth in the NBA in scoring. However, he suffered an ankle injury after 51 games that year. He came back to average 19.6 points in 1995–96. However, controversy surrounded the Mavericks as a rift between Jason Kidd and Jackson emerged; unsubstantiated rumors pointed to a love triangle between Kidd, Jackson, and singer Toni Braxton. In the middle of the 1996–97 season, Jackson was traded to the New Jersey Nets along with Sam Cassell, Eric Montross, George McCloud, and Chris Gatling for Shawn Bradley, Ed O&#x27;Bannon, Robert Pack, and Khalid Reeves.

===New Jersey Nets===
Jackson played and started in only 31 games with the Nets to finish the 1996–97 season averaging 16.5 points and 5.9 rebounds per game with them.

The following offseason, the Nets coveted a college prospect, forward Keith Van Horn out of Utah. In a bidding war with the Chicago Bulls among other teams, they traded Jackson along with Eric Montross and their two first-round picks, Tim Thomas and Anthony Parker, to the Philadelphia 76ers for Michael Cage, Don MacLean, Lucious Harris, and the rights to Van Horn, the second overall pick in the 1997 draft.

===Philadelphia 76ers===
Jackson played in 48 games for the 76ers in the 1997–98 season averaging 13.7 points and 4.7 rebounds per game with decreased minutes from previous seasons. Jackson was reported to be unhappy with his reduced role and shooting while playing with Allen Iverson, who was viewed as the 76ers&#x27; franchise player.

In the middle of the 1997–98 season, the 76ers traded Jackson along with Clarence Weatherspoon to the Golden State Warriors for Joe Smith and Brian Shaw. All four players were free agents at the end of the season, with the 76ers fearing an inability to re-sign Jackson and the Warriors fearing an inability to re-sign Smith.

===Golden State Warriors===
Although Jackson saw an increased role as the Warriors&#x27; starting shooting guard, averaging 18.9 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 40.6 minutes per game for the remainder of the 1997–98 season, he disliked playing for a losing franchise. In the offseason, Jackson signed with the Portland Trail Blazers.

===Portland Trail Blazers===
Jackson was limited in the 1998–99 season with numerous injuries. He averaged 8.4 points and 2.6 rebounds in 24 minutes per game, statistical career lows for him at that time.

Despite having talent and depth, the Trail Blazers were plagued by injuries, attitude problems on the court, and legal problems off the court. In an effort to clean up their image and team chemistry in the 1999 offseason, the Trail Blazers traded or chose not to re-sign many of their players. Jackson, and talented but troubled Isaiah Rider were both traded to the Atlanta Hawks for Steve Smith and Ed Gray.

===Atlanta Hawks===
For the 1999–2000 season, Jackson played in 79 games for the Hawks averaging 16.7 points and 5 rebounds per 35 minutes. Jackson suited up for only 17 games for the Hawks in the 2000–01 season.

After voicing his displeasure with losing, Jackson was traded with Larry Robinson and Anthony Johnson in January 2001 to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Brevin Knight.

===Cleveland Cavaliers===
Hailing from nearby Toledo and a product of Ohio State, Jackson&#x27;s trade to the Cavaliers was viewed as a homecoming of sorts. Additionally, Jackson was happy to be part of a team that, as an early-season success story, was eyeing the playoffs for the 2000–01 season despite a run of injuries to a number of key players. Playing in 39 games and starting only 26 of them, Jackson&#x27;s statistics for the Cavaliers were modest, 10.3 points and 3.7 rebounds in only 29.2 minutes per game. The Cavaliers went on to finish 30–52 and miss the playoffs that season. Jackson did not receive an offer from the Cavaliers or any other team in the following offseason.

===Miami Heat===
At the start of 2001–02 season, Jackson did not have a team, but signed with the Miami Heat in December 2001. The Heat, already with a shallow bench, signed Jackson to mitigate the effects of injuries to key players. Jackson averaged 10.7 points and 5.3 rebounds in 33.2 minutes per game, appearing as a starter in some games as injuries warranted. Again, Jackson did not receive an offer from Miami or any other team in the following offseason.

===Sacramento Kings===
For the start of 2002–03 season, Jackson again did not have a team. For the second straight season, he did not play in the month of November. Jackson eventually signed with the Sacramento Kings in December 2002 to bolster their bench. In 63 games off the bench, Jackson averaged 7.7 points and 4.1 rebounds in only 20.8 minutes per game; however, he played well during crucial moments of games, eventually unseating Hedo Türkoğlu as the sixth man on the team. Jackson saw his stock rise, and as a free agent, received a two-year offer from the Houston Rockets the following offseason.

===Houston Rockets/New Orleans Hornets===
Jackson played in 80 games for the 2003–04 season, starting in all of them. He averaged 12.9 points and 6.1 rebounds in 39 minutes per game. He returned for the 2004–05 season, again putting up decent statistics as a starter for the first 24 games.

Despite averaging 13.3 points and 4.8 rebounds in 41.3 minutes per game, the Rockets dealt Jackson along with Boštjan Nachbar to the New Orleans Hornets for David Wesley. Although Hornets general manager Allan Bristow looked forward to the additions of Nachbar and Jackson, Jackson refused to report to the Hornets, an act for which he was suspended. Without ever appearing in a Hornets uniform, Jackson was traded to the Phoenix Suns for Maciej Lampe, Casey Jacobsen, and Jackson Vroman.
===Phoenix Suns===
Jackson finished the 2004–05 season with the Suns averaging a modest 8.8 points and 3.9 rebounds per 24.9 minutes per game. With starting shooting guard Joe Johnson injured, Jackson stepped up his play in the postseason, helping Phoenix reach the Western Conference final. Although re-signed in the following offseason, Jackson was waived at the beginning of March 2006 after spending nearly two months on the bench without playing any minutes. Jackson averaged career lows of 3.7 points and 2.4 rebounds per 15.6 minutes in 27 games. Immediately after being waived, Jackson was claimed by the Los Angeles Lakers.

===Los Angeles Lakers===
Jackson finished the 2005–06 season with the Lakers, playing in only 13 games with averages of 1.7 points and .9 rebounds per 7 minutes. Jackson did not receive an offer to sign with any team in the following offseason, marking the end of his career. He was the last player on the Lakers to wear #24 before Kobe Bryant.

==Personal life==
During much of his career, Jackson wore a sweatband on his arm with the numbers &quot;419&quot; (which refer to the North American telephone area code 419 that serves Toledo and most of northwest Ohio) to represent where he is from. His son Traevon Jackson played the point guard position for Wisconsin from 2011 to 2015, reaching two Final Fours.

<text>Sterkfontein (Afrikaans for &quot;Strong Spring&quot;) is a set of limestone caves of special interest in paleoanthropology located in Gauteng province, about northwest of Johannesburg, South Africa in the Muldersdrift area close to the town of Krugersdorp. The archaeological sites of Swartkrans and Kromdraai are in the same area. Sterkfontein is a South African National Heritage Site and was also declared a World Heritage Site in 2000. The area in which it is situated is known as the Cradle of Humankind. The Sterkfontein Caves are also home to numerous wild African species including &quot;Belonogaster petiolata&quot;, a wasp species of which there is a large nesting presence.

Numerous early hominin remains have been found at the site over the last few decades. These have been attributed to &quot;Australopithecus&quot;, early &quot;Homo&quot; and &quot;Paranthropus&quot;.

In 2024 the cave was closed to visitors by its owner.

== History of investigations ==

Modern excavation of the caves began in the late 1890s by limestone miners who noticed the fossils and brought them to the attention of scientists.

In 1936, students of Professor Raymond Dart and Dr. Robert Broom from the University of the Witwatersrand began concerted excavations. The caves yielded the first adult Australopithecine, substantially strengthening Dart&#x27;s claim that the skull known as the Taung Child (an &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot;) was a human ancestor. There was a pause in excavation during World War II, but after the war Dr. Robert Broom continued excavations. In 1947, he found a nearly complete skull of an adult female (STS 5) &quot;A. africanus&quot; (or possibly that of an adolescent male). Broom initially named the skull &quot;Plesianthropus transvaalensis&quot; (&quot;near-man&quot; from Transvaal), but it became better known by its nickname, &quot;Mrs. Ples&quot;. Mrs. Ples is now defined as a member of &quot;A. africanus&quot;.

In 1984, Peter Verhulsel who was a member of cave diving expedition researching one of the caves was lost and ultimately starved to death after three weeks in the cave as rescue groups could not find him.

In 1997, a nearly complete skeleton of a second species of &quot;Australopithecus&quot; (StW 573) was found in the caves by Ronald J. Clarke; extraction of the remains from the surrounding breccia is ongoing. The skeleton was named &quot;Little Foot&quot;, since the first parts found (in 1995, in storage) were the bones of a foot. Excavations continue to this day, and finds now total some 500 hominids, making Sterkfontein one of the richest sites in the world for early hominids. The Palaeo-Anthropology Scientific Trust (PAST), a non-profit trust fund established in 1993, sponsors over 90% of the research undertaken at Sterkfontein and was instrumental in its nomination as a World Heritage Site.

==Dating of the deposits==
The Member 4 deposits containing the &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot; fossils have been dated to between 2.6 and 2.0 Ma, with the Sts5 &quot;Mrs. Ples&quot; fossil estimated to date to between 2.05 and 2.01 Ma based on a combination of Uranium–lead dating and palaeomagnetic analysis and electron spin resonance dating The StW 573 partial skeleton (&quot;Little Foot&quot;) was recovered from a separate infill at the site within the confines of the Silberberg Grotto. It is estimated to be around 2.6–2.2 Ma based on a combination of uranium-lead dating and palaeomagnetic analysis and belongs to a second species of australopith, Australopithecus prometheus. In contrast, surface exposure dating of sediments indicate that skeleton StW 573 has an age of approximately 4 million years. While the flowstone dated in the uranium-lead dating has been shown to have formed later than the fossil, an age estimate of ~3 Ma suggested by the same authors has little firm basis. The palaeomagnetic analysis remains the most credible age estimate based on the current data as it included work on both sediments and speleothem.

A slightly younger deposit (StW 53 infill) dated to between has revealed the remains of a specimen of early &quot;Homo&quot; (StW 53). StW 53 has been described as similar to &quot;Homo habilis&quot; or as a novel new species &quot;Homo gautengensis&quot;. No stone tools were associated with the fossil, but StW 53 has evidence for stone tool cut-marks. Member 5 contains Oldowan and Acheulian stone tools as well as specimens of early &quot;Homo&quot; and &quot;Paranthropus&quot; and is dated to between 1.6 and 1.1 Mya.

In 2022 cosmogenic nuclide dating found that the bulk of Member 4 is 3.4 million years old.&quot; The team responsible for this work, which includes Clarke, says: &quot;These results place nearly the entire &quot;Australopithecus&quot; assemblage at Sterkfontein in the mid-Pliocene, contemporaneous with &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot; in East Africa.&quot; They say this discredits the assumption that &quot;A. africanus&quot; descended from &quot;A. afarensis.&quot;

<text>The Open Conspiracy: Blue Prints for a World Revolution was published in 1928 by H. G. Wells, when he was 62 years old. It was revised and expanded in 1930 with the additional subtitle &quot;A Second Version of This Faith of a Modern Man Made More Explicit and Plain.&quot; In 1931 a further revised edition appeared titled &quot;What Are We to Do with Our Lives?&quot;. A final version appeared in 1933 under its original title. Many of its ideas are anticipated in Wells&#x27;s 1926 novel &quot;The World of William Clissold&quot;.

The book is, in Wells&#x27;s words, a &quot;scheme to thrust forward and establish a human control over the destinies of life and liberate it from its present dangers, uncertainties and miseries.&quot; It proposes that largely as the result of scientific progress, a common vision of a world &quot;politically, socially and economically unified&quot; is emerging among educated and influential people, and that this can be the basis of &quot;a world revolution aiming at universal peace, welfare and happy activity&quot; that can result in the establishment of a &quot;world commonwealth&quot;. This is to be achieved by &quot;drawing together a proportion of all or nearly all the functional classes in contemporary communities in order to weave the beginnings of a world community out of their selection.&quot; This will ultimately &quot;be a world religion.&quot;

== Summary ==

In the original edition, Wells begins by discussing religion, arguing that its essence is the subordination of self. &quot;Modern religion,&quot; according to Wells, is the application of this human characteristic to the realisation of &quot;better order in human affairs.&quot; What is contemplated is not a stable order, but rather a dynamic, changing state of affairs in which scientific research and creative activity become the chief preoccupations of a humanity that has solved the problems of subsistence, population control, and the suppression of war.

Wells analyses anticipated sources of resistance to his Open Conspiracy in three lengthy chapters, and takes a hostile stance against the &quot;false loyalties, false standards of honour, false religious associations&quot; that are &quot;vestiges of the ancient order&quot; with which there can be no compromise.

The Open Conspiracy&#x27;s initial tasks are to be (1) explanation and propaganda, and (2) the organisation of open and explicit &quot;refusal to serve in any war.&quot; Beyond that, he advocates the formation of thousands of &quot;ad hoc&quot; groups of all kinds, and anticipates that adherents of the movement will gradually separate themselves from existing society by forming their own schools and social life.

Wells proposes the following &quot;broad essential requirements&quot; for &quot;independent initiatives in the Open Conspiracy&quot;: &quot;(1) The complete assertion [...] of the provision nature of existing governments [...]; (2) The resolve to minimise [...] the conflicts of these governments; (3) The determination to replace private local or national ownership of at least credit, transport and staple production by a responsible world directorate [...]; (4) The practical recognition of the necessity for world biological controls, for example, of population and disease; (5) The support of a minimum standard of individual freedom and welfare in the world; and (6) The supreme duty of subordinating the personal life to the creation of a world directorate capable of these tasks and to the general advancement of human knowledge, capacity and power.&quot;

While hoping that the progress of the movement can be pacifistic, Wells expresses a willingness to accept hardship and martyrdom if need be: &quot;The vision of a world at peace and liberated for an unending growth of knowledge and power is worth every danger of the way.&quot;

== Reception ==

&quot;The Open Conspiracy&quot; sold well and was well received by friends like Bertrand Russell, who said he read it &quot;with the most complete sympathy.&quot; Some Open Conspiracy organisations were formed in a number of countries and a common newsletter was published. Wells discussed the ideas at luncheons with some leading British politicians, including Lloyd George, Harold Macmillan, and Harold Nicolson. The H. G. Wells Society set up by Gerald Heard in 1934 to promote Wells&#x27; ideas at one point changed its name to &quot;The Open Conspiracy&quot;.

Both the book&#x27;s form and content were criticised by George Bernard Shaw, who thought that Wells dismissed Karl Marx too readily and wrote in the style of an editorialist. G. K. Chesterton was also critical. Wells&#x27; biographer Michael Sherborne notes that while Wells&#x27; critics have described &quot;The Open Conspiracy&quot; as anti-democratic and elitist, his supporters have argued the book is &quot;a boost for a civil society realized today by bodies such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International.&quot;

<doc id="614366" wikidata="Q5440778" url="?curid=614366" title="Federation of Conservative Students">
<text>The Federation of Conservative Students (FCS) was the student organisation of the British Conservative Party from the late 1940s to 1986. It was created to act as a bridge between the student movement and the Conservative Party. It produced several magazines, and had regular Assembly meetings in which motions would be voted on. It had supported some controversial actions, such as the legalisation of various drugs, and the privatisation of the Trident nuclear missiles. There was continual tension between central party, which funded the organisation, and the Federation – which often used the funds on exploring unconventional policies.

The Federation had considerable influence on national politics (considered by some to be &quot;the fast track to the next Conservative Party&quot;), as committee members were consulted by MP&#x27;s, and Ted Heath specifically had speeches written by the Federation&#x27;s chairmen.

In its final years it became known colloquially as &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Militant Tendency&quot;, in reference to then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and to Militant, an entryist group active in the Labour Party at the time. The FCS was then broken up by the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Norman Tebbit, after one of its members had accused previous former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan of war crimes in extraditing Cossacks to the Soviet Union. The FCS was replaced by the Conservative Collegiate Forum.

==History==
The organisation was originally founded as the Federation of University Conservative and Unionists Associations (FUCUA) in January 1930 with Col. John Buchan MP (later Lord Tweedsmuir and Governor General of Canada) as its first President.

FUCUA was renamed the Federation of Conservative Students in 1967. From the 1980s onward it became a more controversial group.

===Paradigm shift===
The policies of Margaret Thatcher had a polarising effect on British politics and the student left moved towards radicalism in their response to them. Many students&#x27; unions would pass motions instituting a policy of &quot;No Platform for Racists or Fascists&quot;. Starting in the early 1980s, the organisation adopted a more confrontational approach toward the left-leaning National Union of Students. Leaders, most notably from Scotland, started advocating &quot;voluntary students&#x27; unions&quot;. They organised campaigns aimed at disaffiliating individual students&#x27; unions from the NUS to weaken the so-called block vote, and deprive it of taxpayers&#x27; money which the NUS used for various causes. Posters and other publicity material became much more provocative and hard-hitting.

===Factionalism===
In the early years FCS was moderate in its outlook and elected a number of National Chairmen reflecting a mainstream outlook. These included Mark Carlisle MP, Andrew Neil and Antony Buck MP.

However the 1970s saw increasing factionalism mirroring the internal conflicts between Monday Club and the Heathite leadership. In its last years, the FCS, perhaps reflecting the debate within the Conservative party of the 1980s and the generally fractious nature of student politics, was notably prone to factionalism. The three main factions were:
* An authoritarian faction
* A libertarian, or &quot;sound&quot;, faction
* A moderate faction, known to the other factions as &quot;wet&quot;

====Authoritarians====
The authoritarian faction centred on the student Monday Club, and was not particularly well known compared to the much larger Libertarian faction. It was linked with traditional British nationalism, an isolationist posture in relation to foreign affairs, opposition (as espoused by Enoch Powell) to immigration, scepticism about liberal economics, and staunch support for the Union.

====Libertarians====
The Libertarian faction (the &quot;Libs&quot;) was closely linked to the Libertarian Alliance run by Chris Tame, and the Adam Smith Institute, run by Madsen Pirie.

The Libertarian faction was the largest faction in the FCS in its last few years. Its overall dominance is illustrated by the passage of a libertarian motion in favour of free migration at the Leicester conference, shortly before the demise of the FCS, which was opposed by both the wet and the authoritarian factions.

Under Glendening, elected Chairman in 1984, the FCS became more controversial than ever as it embraced social liberalism in addition to the already established endorsement of economic libertarianism; issues such as supporting the legalisation of drugs were no longer taboo.

Many former leaders of the libertarian faction, such as Mark MacGregor, went on to hold senior office in the Conservative Party. Other notable members of &quot;the Libs&quot; included Brian Monteith, Robbie Gibb, and Douglas &quot;Dougie&quot; Smith. John Bercow and Andrew Rosindell were once also members, although they had also been part of the authoritarian faction.

====Moderates====
The Moderate faction had controlled the FCS until 1980. Some of them were members of the Tory Reform Group (TRG). Eight prominent members of the moderate faction including several former chairmen joined the SDP in 1981.

Despite a relatively high number of supporters and control of some large student bodies, they only once gained influence in the national federation after 1980, through a controversial last minute alliance with the authoritarian faction in 1983.

The moderate faction was usually referred to by its opponents as the &quot;Wets&quot; in an allusion to the contemporary nickname for the anti-Thatcherite wing of the parliamentary party, although after 1980 this description was often vehemently rejected by members of the moderate faction in FCS themselves in favour of titles such as the &quot;Party Faction&quot; and &quot;Conservative Student Unionists.&quot; This was partly because they saw themselves as seeking to represent the mainstream of the party and not just the left, and partly because this faction did contain a significant proportion of prominent members such as Paul Goodman and Mark Francois who later became MPs perceived to be to the right of the party leadership.

In many universities the TRG organised itself as a complementary political society to the main Conservative group. This is a policy that the TRG has maintained since, although the last of these societies, the Oxford TRG Society, merged with Oxford&#x27;s Conservative Association in 2007.

==Controversy==

===Political stance===
In the 1980s, the FCS was noted for being more radical than the main party, more Thatcherite than Thatcher – ministers invited to speak at conferences were routinely chastised for not going far enough.

In addition to supporting privatisation, controversial positions embraced included the support for American intervention in Grenada, RENAMO, the UNITA rebels in Angola, and the Contras in Nicaragua. The Federation made badges with the words &quot;Nicaragua Must be Free&quot;. Some Labour students began wearing them without realising their origin and intended meaning.

===Alleged riot at Loughborough University===
There was some damage during the 1985 FCS conference at Loughborough University, leading to press reports of a &quot;riot&quot;. The officers elected at that conference were mainly of the libertarian faction who espouse many of the controversial libertarian ideals which have embarrassed the party leadership. Although it was clear that some damage was done, the so-called riot was vastly exaggerated, the final bill for repairs that the University presented came to under £20, and there would not be enough evidence to close the FCS as the then Party Chairman John Selwyn Gummer wanted. Nevertheless, reports of &quot;riots&quot; in the media, including the &quot;Daily Star&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, motivated Gummer immediately to suspend the FCS&#x27;s £30,000 annual grant.

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that the &quot;students cleared up the mess after the offending party, and journalists who saw the room the morning after reported a damaged door handle, a missing light bulb and beer stains on the carpet in a corridor to be the only visible signs of damage.&quot; Inspector Patricia Perry of Loughborough Police Station said &quot;there was no physical damage&quot;. In a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, Professor Peter Havard-Williams of Loughborough University stated &quot;The damage itself was not more than that done by many other conferences and was not excessive.&quot; Mark MacGregor suggested that Gummer&#x27;s actions were politically motivated: &quot;Unfortunately, many of our supporters will see this as a move against the leaders they have elected. Our supporters are from working-class backgrounds, and the party establishment seems to feel that we don&#x27;t quite fit in.&quot;

In &quot;The Observer&quot;, Toby Young wrote: &quot;As nights of mob terror go, last Monday&#x27;s party at the Federation of Conservative Students&#x27; Conference was pretty tame&quot;. Both Young and Sir Alfred Sherman believed that Gummer&#x27;s actions were motivated by his opposition to the libertarian ideology of some of the FCS&#x27; members which closely resembled some of Mrs Thatcher&#x27;s personal beliefs. Sherman wrote that Gummer&#x27;s actions were &quot;directed against the Prime Minister&quot;. Tim Hames and Nick Robinson later admitted that the bill presented for damage was less than £20, and that the media reports were as a result of an &quot;astute spinning operation&quot; by Wet delegates from the University of Oxford, who &quot;directed journalists to students who offered harrowing accounts of the boorish behaviour of libertarian activists.&quot;

==Demise==
The FCS was disbanded by Norman Tebbit, who succeeded Gummer as the party chairman. This was for publishing an article, penned by Harry Phibbs, following Nikolai Tolstoy&#x27;s accusation that former Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was complicit in war crimes for his involvement in the forced repatriation of Cossack prisoners of war to Soviet Russia in the aftermath of World War II.

<text>Wanda Yvette Sykes (born March 7, 1964) is an American stand-up comedian, actress, and writer. She was first recognized for her work as a writer on &quot;The Chris Rock Show&quot;, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award in 1999. In 2004, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Sykes as one of the 25 funniest people in America. She is also known for her recurring roles on CBS&#x27; &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine&quot; (2006–10), and HBO&#x27;s &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; (2001–2011). She received Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series nominations for her roles in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Black-ish&quot; (2015–2022), and Amazon&#x27;s &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; (2020). She currently stars in the Netflix original series &quot;The Upshaws&quot; (2021–), the HBO Max comedy series &quot;The Other Two&quot; (2019–2023), and &quot;The Good Fight&quot; (2021).

Aside from her television appearances, Sykes has also had a career in film, appearing in &quot;Monster-in-Law&quot; (2005), &quot;My Super Ex-Girlfriend&quot; (2006), &quot;Evan Almighty&quot; (2007), and &quot;License to Wed&quot; (2007), as well as voicing characters in animated films such as &quot;Over the Hedge&quot;, &quot;Barnyard&quot;, &quot;Brother Bear 2&quot; (all in 2006), &quot;Rio&quot; (2011), two sequels of the &quot;Ice Age&quot; franchise (2012–2016), and &quot;UglyDolls&quot; (2019).

==Early life and family==
Wanda Sykes was born in Portsmouth, Virginia. Her family moved to Maryland when she was in the third grade. Her mother, Marion Louise (née Peoples), worked as a banker, and her father, Harry Ellsworth Sykes, was a U.S. Army colonel employed at the Pentagon.

Sykes&#x27; family history was researched for an episode of the 2012 PBS genealogy program &quot;Finding Your Roots With Henry Louis Gates Jr.&quot; Her ancestry was traced back to a 1683 court case involving her ancestor, Elizabeth Banks, a free white woman and indentured servant, who gave birth to a biracial child, Mary Banks, fathered by a slave, who inherited her mother&#x27;s free status. According to historian Ira Berlin, a specialist in the history of American slavery, the Sykes family history is &quot;the only such case that I know of in which it is possible to trace a black family rooted in freedom from the late 17th century to the present.&quot;

Sykes attended Arundel High School in Gambrills, Maryland, and went on to graduate from Hampton University, where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in marketing and became a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha. After college, her first job was as a contracting specialist at the National Security Agency, where she worked for five years.

==Career==
=== 1990s ===
Following a role with the National Security Agency (NSA), Sykes began her stand-up career at a Coors Light Super Talent Showcase in Washington, D.C., where she performed for the first time in front of a live audience in 1987.

She continued to perform at local venues while at the NSA until 1992, when she moved to New York City. One of her early TV appearances was Russell Simmons&#x27; Def Comedy Jam in the early 1990s, where she shared the stage with Adele Givens, J. B. Smoove, D. L. Hughley, Bernie Mac, &amp; Bill Bellamy. Working for the Hal Leonard publishing house, she edited a book entitled &quot;Polyrhythms – The Musician&#x27;s Guide&quot;, by Peter Magadini.
Her first big break came when opening for Chris Rock at Caroline&#x27;s Comedy Club.

In 1997, she joined the writing team on &quot;The Chris Rock Show&quot; and also made many appearances on the show. The writing team was nominated for four Emmys, and in 1999, won for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music, or Comedy Special.

Since that time, she has appeared in the films &quot;Pootie Tang&quot; and on TV shows such as &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. In 2003, she starred in her own short-lived Fox network sitcom, &quot;Wanda at Large&quot;. The same year, Sykes appeared in an hour-long Comedy Central special, &quot;Tongue Untied&quot;. That network also ranked her No. 70 on its list of the 100 greatest all-time stand ups. She served as a correspondent for HBO&#x27;s &quot;Inside the NFL&quot;, hosted Comedy Central&#x27;s popular show &quot;Premium Blend&quot;, and voiced a recurring character named Gladys on Comedy Central&#x27;s puppet show &quot;Crank Yankers&quot;. She also had a short-lived show on Comedy Central called &quot;Wanda Does It&quot;.

=== 2000s ===
Sykes wrote &quot;Yeah, I Said It&quot;, a book of humorous observations on various topics, published in September 2004. In 2006, she landed a recurring role as Barb, opposite Julia Louis-Dreyfus, on the sitcom &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine&quot;; she became a series regular during the series&#x27; third season in 2008. She also guest starred in the &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; episode &quot;Buy, Buy Baby&quot; in 2006. She provided voices for the 2006 films &quot;Over the Hedge&quot;, &quot;Barnyard&quot;, and &quot;Brother Bear 2&quot;. She had a part in &quot;My Super Ex-Girlfriend&quot; and after playing in &quot;Evan Almighty&quot;, had a bit part in &quot;License to Wed&quot;. Sykes&#x27;s first HBO Comedy Special, entitled &quot;Wanda Sykes: Sick &amp; Tired&quot;, premiered on October 14, 2006; it was nominated for a 2007 Emmy Award. In 2008, she performed as part of Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s True Colors Tour for LGBT rights.

In October 2008, Sykes appeared in a television ad for the Think Before You Speak Campaign, an advertising campaign by GLSEN aimed at curbing homophobic slang in youth communities. In the 30-second spot, she uses humor to scold a teenager for saying &quot;that&#x27;s so gay&quot; when he really means &quot;that is so bad&quot;. In March 2009, Sykes became the host of a late-night talk show on Saturdays on &quot;Fox&quot;, &quot;The Wanda Sykes Show&quot; which was scheduled to premiere November 7, 2009. In April 2009, she was named in &quot;Out&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Annual Power 50 List&quot;, landing at number 35.

In May 2009, Sykes was the featured entertainer for the annual White House Correspondents&#x27; Association dinner, becoming both the first African American woman and the first openly LGBT person to get the role. Cedric the Entertainer had been the first African American to become the featured entertainer in 2005. At this event, Sykes made controversial headlines as she responded to conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s comments regarding President Barack Obama. Limbaugh, in reference to Obama&#x27;s presidential agenda, had said &quot;I hope he fails&quot;. In response, Sykes quipped: &quot;I hope his [Limbaugh&#x27;s] kidneys fail, how &#x27;bout that? Needs a little waterboarding, that&#x27;s what he needs.&quot; Her second comedy special, &quot;Wanda Sykes: I&#x27;ma Be Me&quot; premiered on HBO in October 2009. November 2009 saw the premier of &quot;The Wanda Sykes Show&quot;, which starts with a monologue and continues with a panel discussion in a similar format to Bill Maher&#x27;s shows &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; and &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;.

=== 2010s ===
She appeared as Miss Hannigan in a professional theatre production of &quot;Annie&quot; at The Media Theatre in Media, PA, a suburb southwest of Philadelphia. Her first appearance in a musical, she played the role from November 23 to December 12, 2010, and again from January 12 to 23, 2011. She voices the Witch in the &quot;Bubble Guppies&quot; episode &quot;Bubble Puppy&#x27;s Fin-tastic Fairlytale Adventure&quot;. In 2012, Sykes played the role of Granny in Blue Sky Studios&#x27; &quot;Ice Age: Continental Drift&quot;. In 2016, she returned to the role in &quot;Ice Age: Collision Course&quot;. In May 2013, Sykes was a featured entertainer at Olivia Travel&#x27;s 40th anniversary Music &amp; Comedy Festival in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.

In 2013, Sykes appeared in eight episodes of Amazon&#x27;s &quot;Alpha House&quot;, a political comedy series written by &quot;Doonesbury&quot; creator Garry Trudeau. Sykes plays Rosalyn DuPeche, a Democratic Senator from Illinois and the next door neighbor of four Republican senators living together in a house on Capitol Hill. Sykes also appeared in Season Two, which became available in October 2014. The series was canceled after the second season. In 2018, Sykes became the head writer for the revived tenth season of &quot;Roseanne&quot;. This attracted attention due to star Roseanne Barr&#x27;s history of controversial political remarks. On May 29, 2018, Sykes announced on Twitter that she would no longer be working on the series after a since-deleted Twitter rant by Roseanne Barr about Valerie Jarrett; &quot;Roseanne&quot; was subsequently canceled by ABC.

=== 2020s ===
In 2021, Sykes began starring on the Netflix sitcom &quot;The Upshaws&quot;. Sykes co-hosted the 94th Academy Awards with Regina Hall and Amy Schumer on March 27, 2022. The telecast is most known for its infamous moment where Will Smith slapped Chris Rock. Sykes condemned the actions of Smith stating on &quot;Ellen&quot; 
&quot;For [The Academy] to let him stay in that room and enjoy the rest of the show and accept his award, I was like, &#x27;How gross is this? This is just the wrong message.&#x27; You assault somebody, you get escorted out of the building and that&#x27;s it. For them to let him continue, I thought it was gross&quot;.

In January 2023, Sykes guest hosted &quot;The Daily Show&quot; after Trevor Noah&#x27;s departure.

==Personal life==

Sykes was married to record producer Dave Hall from 1991 to 1998. In November 2008, she publicly came out as a lesbian while at a same-sex marriage rally in Las Vegas regarding Proposition 8. A month earlier, Sykes married her wife Alex Niedbalski, a French woman, whom she met in 2006. The couple also became parents in April 2009, when Niedbalski gave birth to a pair of fraternal twins.

Sykes came out to her parents in 2004 when she was 40, who both initially had difficulty accepting her homosexuality. They declined to attend her wedding, which led to a brief period of estrangement; they have since reconciled with Sykes.

During a September 19, 2011, appearance on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, Sykes announced that she had been diagnosed earlier in the year with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Although DCIS is a non-invasive &quot;stage zero breast cancer&quot;, Sykes had elected to have a bilateral mastectomy to lower her chances of getting breast cancer. Sykes splits time between Media, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia, and Cherry Grove, New York.

===Activism===
Sykes publicly expressed being devastated when California voters passed state Proposition 8. She said: &quot;with the legislation that they passed, I can&#x27;t sit by and just watch. I just can&#x27;t do it.&quot; She has continued to be active in same-sex marriage issues hosting events and emceeing fundraisers. She has also worked with PETA on promoting dog anti-chaining legislation in her home state.

She has been an outspoken supporter of Detroit&#x27;s Ruth Ellis Center after the organization&#x27;s staff sent Sykes a letter asking her to visit during her 2010 tour&#x27;s stop in Detroit.

Sykes often uses Twitter to express her political views, including on May 25, 2021, retweeting a photograph by Evan Vucci of Gianna Floyd, daughter of George Floyd, entering the White House. On July 17, 2021, she also tweeted, &quot;Congress MUST pass the #ForThePeopleAct&quot;, and called on her followers to join the &quot;Good Trouble Vigil&quot;, commemorating the passing of activist and Congressman John Lewis.

<doc id="614371" wikidata="Q2032354" url="?curid=614371" title="Pietro Belluschi">
<text>Pietro Belluschi (August 18, 1899 – February 14, 1994) was an Italian-American architect. A leading figure in modern architecture, he was responsible for the design of over 1,000 buildings.

Born in Ancona, Italy, Belluschi began his architectural career as a draftsman in a Portland, Oregon firm. He achieved a national reputation within about 20 years, largely for his 1947 aluminum-clad Equitable Building. In 1951, he was named the dean of the MIT School of Architecture and Planning, where he served until 1965, also working as collaborator and design consultant for many high-profile commissions, most famously the 1963 Pan Am Building. He won the American Institute of Architects&#x27; Gold Medal in 1972.

==Early life==

Pietro Belluschi was born in Ancona, Italy, in 1899. He grew up in Italy and served in the Italian armed forces during World War I when Italy was allied with Great Britain, France, and later the United States. Serving in the army he fought against the Austrians at the battles of Caporetto and Vittorio Veneto. After the war, Belluschi studied at the University of Rome, earning a degree in civil engineering in 1922.

He moved to the United States in 1923, despite speaking no English, and finished his education—as an exchange student on a scholarship—at Cornell University with a second degree in civil engineering. Instead of returning to Italy, he worked briefly as a mining engineer in Idaho earning $5 per day, but he then joined the architectural office of A. E. Doyle in Portland, living in Goose Hollow. He remained in the U.S., as friends in Italy had cautioned him to not return home because of the rise to power of Benito Mussolini and the Fascist government.

==Career==
At Doyle&#x27;s office, Belluschi rose rapidly, soon becoming chief designer. After Doyle died in 1928, the firm took him into partnership in 1933. By 1943, Belluschi had assumed control of the firm by buying out all the other partners and was practicing under his own name.

In 1951, Belluschi became Dean of the architecture and planning school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a position he held until 1965. When he accepted the position of dean and moved to Massachusetts, he transferred his office in Portland to the architecture firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. The move reduced his annual income from $150,000 to a salary of $15,000, but was prompted by health concerns attributable to the long hours of managing his office while still designing buildings.

Belluschi emerged as a leader in the development of American Modern architecture, with the design of several buildings reflecting the influence of the International Style and his awareness of the technological opportunities of new materials. Most important was the Equitable Building (1944–47) in Portland, Oregon: a concrete frame office block clad in aluminum, and considered the first office building with a completely sealed air-conditioned environment.

Belluschi&#x27;s churches and residences differed from his commercial works. Although of Modern design, they fit within the development of the Pacific Northwest regional Modern idiom as they frequently used regional materials (particularly wood) and were often integrated with their suburban or rural sites.

==Awards and honors==
Belluschi was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1952. In 1953, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1957. He served as a presidential appointee on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1950 to 1955. He was a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects (AIA), and was awarded the AIA Gold Medal, the highest award given by the institute, in 1972. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts by the National Endowment for the Arts in 1991 for his lifetime achievements. Belluschi was on the jury that selected the winning design for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C.

==Later life==
After leaving MIT in 1965, he continued to work. Belluschi would design and consult on both buildings and issues surrounding urban planning. Pietro Belluschi was married first to Helen Hemmila on December 1, 1934, the mother of his two sons, Peter and Anthony. His son Anthony Belluschi is an architect. After his wife&#x27;s death in 1962, he married in 1965 to Marjorie Bruckner (1920–2009). Pietro Belluschi died in Portland on February 14, 1994.

<text>Kitty Kallen (born Katie Kallen; May 25, 1921 – January 7, 2016) was an American singer whose career spanned from the 1930s to the 1960s, including the Swing era of the Big Band years, the post-World War II pop scene, and the early years of rock &#x27;n roll. Kallen performed with popular big band leaders of the 1940s, including Jimmy Dorsey and Harry James, before establishing a solo career.

She is widely known for her 1954 solo recording &#x27;&quot;Little Things Mean a Lot&quot;, a song that stayed at the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; number one spot for nine consecutive weeks and took top honor as 1954&#x27;s #1 song of the year, charted in the U.S. for almost seven months, hit No. 1 on the UK singles chart, and sold more than two million copies. Voted &quot;most popular female singer&quot; in 1954 in both &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot; polls, Kallen lost her voice at the London Palladium in 1955 at the top of her career and stopped singing before an audience for four years. After testing her voice under a pseudonym in small town venues, she ultimately returned and went on to achieve 13 top-ten career hits.

==Early life==
Born Katie Kallen (her birth name at times erroneously reported as Katherine Kalinsky) on May 25, 1921, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Russian Jewish immigrants Samuel and Fannie Kalinsky (nee Kaplan) (later Kallen), she was one of seven children. As a child, she won an amateur contest by imitating popular singers. When she returned home with her prize, a camera, her father did not believe her, and punished her for stealing the camera. Only when neighbors subsequently visited to congratulate her did Kallen&#x27;s father realize she had actually won it.

==Career==
As a young girl, she sang on &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;, a radio program sponsored by Horn &amp; Hardart, the legendary automat chain. As a preteen, Kallen had a radio program on Philadelphia&#x27;s WCAU and sang with the big bands of Jan Savitt in 1936, Artie Shaw in 1938, and Jack Teagarden in 1939. It was with Teagarden&#x27;s band that Kallen cut her first records, eight sides in total.

Shortly before her 21st birthday, on May 5, 1942, she sang the vocals for &quot;Moonlight Becomes You&quot;, with Bobby Sherwood and His Orchestra at the second ever session for what was then still called Liberty Records but would soon be renamed Capitol Records. It was her only session for the label.

At 21, she joined the Jimmy Dorsey band, replacing Helen O&#x27;Connell. One of her recordings with Dorsey was a favorite of American servicemen: &quot;They&#x27;re Either Too Young or Too Old&quot; reached the No. 2 position in the Billboard charts in 1944. The same year, Kallen performed the vocals for Dorsey&#x27;s number-one hit &quot;Besame Mucho&quot;. Most of her singing assignments were in duets with Bob Eberly, and when Eberly left to go into the service toward the end of 1943, she joined Harry James&#x27;s band.

Between January and November 1945, she had two songs recorded with the Harry James Orchestra in the top twenty, six in the top ten, and two at the No. 1 spot: &quot;I&#x27;m Beginning to See the Light&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Been a Long, Long Time&quot;, which remains deeply associated with the end of World War II and the returning troops. In 1951, Kallen appeared with Buster Crabbe as the Queen and King of Winter at the Lake Placid resort.

As a solo performer following the war, Kallen bounced from label to label--a brief stint with Musicraft in 1946 and then three years at Mercury in 1949-51, followed by a stint at Columbia and a reunion with Harry James. Despite covering a number of songs that had been hits for other singers, she still failed to produce a major hit. It was not until signing with Decca in 1953 that she at last enjoyed chart success.

With the 1954 hit &quot;Little Things Mean a Lot&quot;, she was voted the most popular female singer in &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot; polls. AllMusic called the recording a &quot;monster hit&quot;, and music historian Jonny Whiteside said the song &quot;ably characterizes Kallen&#x27;s impressive, and graceful, transition from classic big band swing to modern post-war pop&quot;. She followed up the song with &quot;In the Chapel in the Moonlight&quot;, another million selling record, in the U.S. and a version of &quot;True Love&quot; for Decca.

Kallen performed at numerous prominent live venues including Manhattan&#x27;s &quot;Copacabana&quot;, Morris Levy&#x27;s &quot;Versailles&quot;, the Capitol Theater, the Maisonette Room at the St. Regis, the Cafe Rouge at the Hotel Pennsylvania and the Plaza Hotel&#x27;s Persian Room. As well as this, she starred on Broadway in &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;; in the 1955 film &quot;The Second Greatest Sex&quot; and on numerous television shows including &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Johnny Carson, &quot;The Big Beat&quot; with singer-host Richard Hayes, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, and Fred Allen&#x27;s &quot;Judge for Yourself&quot;.

In 1956, rock-and-roll was dominating the charts and nosing out most older singers. Kallen experienced a mental breakdown during this time in which she found herself unable to sing live, although she could perform in the studio with no problems. She sought help from a psychiatrist but ended the sessions after he asked her to undress as part of therapy. Kallen&#x27;s psychological issues and the changing music landscape convinced her to retire from performing, but three years later she decided to make a comeback and signed with Columbia.

In 1959, she recorded &quot;If I Give My Heart to You&quot; for Columbia and in 1963, she recorded a top-selling version of &quot;My Coloring Book&quot; for RCA Victor. Her final album was &quot;Quiet Nights&quot;, a bossa nova–flavored release for 20th Century Fox Records after which she retired from recording permanently.

During the height of her popularity, three imposters billed themselves as Kitty Kallen. When one of them, Genevieve Agostinello, died in 1978, it was incorrectly reported that Kallen herself had died. On February 8, 1960, Kallen received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (located on the north side of Hollywood Boulevard at #7021).

A compilation of her hits on various labels remains available on the Sony CD set &quot;The Kitty Kallen Story&quot;.

== Marriages ==
While performing with Jack Teagarden&#x27;s band, she married Clint Garvin, the band&#x27;s clarinet player. When Teagarden fired Garvin, Kallen left as well, later annulling the marriage. In 1948, Kallen married Bernard &quot;Budd&quot; Granoff, a publicist, agent, and television producer — who later became a pioneering television syndicator. The couple, married for over forty-five years until Granoff&#x27;s death in 1996, had a son, Jonathan Granoff, President of the Global Security Institute and Adjunct Professor of International Law at Widener University School of Law.

==Later years==
In 1977, Kallen sued her dermatologist, Norman Orentreich, after he prescribed an estrogen drug, Premarin, for her small facial wrinkles. She subsequently suffered blood clots in her lungs, caused directly by the drug, and was awarded $300,000 by a court.

In 2008, Kallen joined artists Patti Page, Tony Martin, Dick Hyman, Richard Hayman and the estates of Count Basie, Benny Goodman, Sarah Vaughan, Woody Herman, Les Brown, the Mills Brothers, Jerry Murad, Frankie Laine, and the gospel singer Sister Rosetta Tharpe in a suit against the world&#x27;s then largest music label, Universal Music Group, alleging the company had cheated them on royalties.

In 2009, Kallen was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame.

Kallen had homes in Englewood, New Jersey, and Cuernavaca, Mexico. By the end of her life, she lived full-time in Cuernavaca, where she died on January 7, 2016, at the age of 94. She was in a relationship with Sonny Shiell in her later years.

<text>Hascosay (; Old Norse &quot;Hafskotsey&quot;) is a small island lying between Yell and Fetlar in the Shetland Islands, Scotland.

==Geography and geology==
The island&#x27;s rock is coarse micaceous gneiss. It has several pools, but the fresh water in them is frequently contaminated by salt spray. Its area is just over .

==History==
The population of the island was 42 in 1841, but had shrunk to thirteen within a decade. In 1871, the population numbered 4, and in 1881, the island was uninhabited. The laird, Arthur Nicolson, who had bought it had &quot;cleared&quot; parts of Fetlar, and it is possible that the islanders removed themselves in anticipation of a possible future forcible eviction by this landowner.

==Wildlife==

The island is designated as a Special Area of Conservation on account of its largely undisturbed blanket bog habitat. It is also home to a population of otters.

<text>Western Goals Foundation was a private domestic intelligence agency active in the United States. It was founded in 1979 by Major General John K. Singlaub, the publisher and spy John H. Rees, and Congressman Larry McDonald. It went defunct in 1986 when the Tower Commission revealed it had been part of Oliver North&#x27;s Iran–Contra funding network.

== History ==
After the Watergate and COINTELPRO scandals of the early 1970s, several laws were passed to restrict police intelligence gathering within political organizations and tried to make it necessary to demonstrate that a criminal act was likely to be uncovered by any intelligence gathering proposed. Many files on radicals, collected for decades, were ordered destroyed. The unintended effect of the laws was to privatize the files in the hands of &#x27;retired&#x27; intelligence officers and their operatives.

As a private foundation, Western Goals collected information about alleged subversives and passed the information to law enforcement officials, akin to a &quot;mini-deep state&quot;. According to former employees, agencies receiving information from Western Goals included the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency, and police departments.

John Rees and Larry McDonald joined with Major General Singlaub to form Western Goals in 1979. Each founder was also a member of the World Anti-Communist League, the John Birch Society, and similar organizations. One of its principal sponsors was the Texan billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt.

The organization was based in a townhouse in Alexandria, Virginia. It also said it had offices in West Germany and Austria. A former employee told &quot;Politico&quot; in 2018 that more of its funding came from West Germany than the United States.

Rees set up a computer database to track suspected radicals, and wrote many of Western Goals&#x27; published reports about domestic subversives, terrorism and communist threats. People in law enforcement sometimes leaked derogatory intelligence to Western Goals, which Rees then published in newsletters, which in turn were entered into the Congressional Record by McDonald, which shielded him from libel. Western Goals would then cite McDonald&#x27;s statements in its own public reports. Unverified reports by Western Goals accusing American pacifist groups of ties to communism and the Soviet Union were also publicized in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; and by the Reagan administration.

Western Goals was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) after a police officer was caught adding information from the disbanded Los Angeles Police Department &quot;Red Squad&quot; to a related computer bulletin board system.

Western Goals raised funds for the Nicaraguan Contras starting in 1983, after Congress banned the Reagan administration from providing U.S. support. A Contra brigade of 2,000 was named the Larry McDonald Task Force to honor the Western Goals co-founder, who had been killed in the Soviet downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. Singlaub was an intermediary in Oliver North’s illegal weapons network for the Contras. Officials of the foundation were questioned in the Iran-Contra hearings of 1986.

The organization founded an offshoot, Western Goals (UK), later the Western Goals Institute, which was briefly influential in British Conservative politics.

<doc id="614382" wikidata="Q254266" url="?curid=614382" title="Wolfpack (naval tactic)">
<text>The wolfpack was a convoy attack tactic employed in the Second World War. It was used principally by the U-boats of the during the Battle of the Atlantic, and by the submarines of the United States Navy in the Pacific War. The idea of a co-ordinated submarine attack on convoys had been proposed during the First World War but had had no success. In the Atlantic during the Second World War, the Germans had considerable successes with their wolfpack attacks but were ultimately defeated by the Allies. In the Pacific, the American submarine force was able to devastate Japan’s merchant marine, though this was not solely due to the wolfpack tactic. Wolfpacks fell out of use during the Cold War as the role of the submarine changed and as convoys became rare.

==World War I==
During the (German war on trade) Allied ships travelled independently prior to the introduction of the convoy system and were vulnerable to attacks by U-boats operating as &#x27;lone wolves&#x27;. By gathering up merchant ships into convoys the British Admiralty denied them targets and presented a more defensible front if found and attacked. The logical remedy for the U-boat Arm was to gather U-boats similarly into attacking formations.

In early 1917 Hermann Bauer, the Commander of the High Seas U-boats ( [FdU]) proposed establishing patrol lines of U-boats across convoy routes, in order to mass for attack on any convoy reported. These boats would be supported by a forward base on land and a headquarters and supply vessel, such as the -class converted U-cruisers equipped with radio and supplies of fuel and torpedoes. The shore station would monitor radio transmissions and the commander in the HQ boat would co-ordinate the attack.

This proved easier to propose than to carry out and proved disastrous when tried. In May 1918 six U-boats under the command of KL Rucker, in , were operating in the English Channel; &quot;U-103&quot; made contact with a troop convoy but was rammed and sunk by the troopship before she could attack. found convoy HS 38 but managed only one torpedo attack, which missed. &quot;UB 72&quot; was caught on the surface by British submarine , torpedoed and sunk. During the period of operation, 19 homeward and 11 outward convoys passed through the patrol area without loss and two U-boats (a third of the force) had been destroyed.

In October 1918 another attempt at a co-ordinated attack was made in the Mediterranean, when two U-boats attempted a co-ordinated attack on a convoy. One of them was sunk and its commander, Karl Dönitz, was taken prisoner.

==Inter war years==
During the interwar years the German Navy was forbidden to have U-boats but began to re-arm in 1935. Under Karl Dönitz as developed co-ordinated attack tactics based on Bauer&#x27;s plan and his own experience and trials of the new tactics in 1936 proved successful. Dönitz called his strategy of submarine warfare , which literally translates as &quot;pack tactic&quot; but referred specifically to the hunting tactics of wolves and submarines were known by their nickname of (grey wolves).

==U-boats in the Second World War==

With the outbreak of the Second World War the U-boat Arm found the success of the pre-war trials had created some complacency; when these tactics were first tried in October 1939 (Hartmann&#x27;s wolfpack) they were a failure; Hartmann found he was unable to exercise any tactical control from his boat at sea and the convoy attack was unsuccessful, while three U-boats were lost in the operation. A second attempt the following month also failed. A further attempt in June 1940 following the Norwegian campaign (Rösing&#x27;s wolfpack) also failed, leading to a re-think of German tactics.
The revised approach saw Dönitz micromanaging operations at sea from his headquarters in occupied France, relying on the supposedly unbreakable Enigma code to transmit and receive orders and co-ordinate movements. U-boat movements were controlled by U-boat Command (&quot;BdU)&quot; from Kerneval. U-boats usually patrolled separately, often strung out in lines across likely convoy routes to engage merchant ships and small vulnerable destroyers, being ordered to congregate only after one located a convoy and alerted the . (pack tactics) consisted of as many U-boats as could reach the scene of the attack. With the exception of the orders given by the , U-boat commanders could attack as they saw fit. Often they were given a probable number of U-boats that would arrive and when they were in contact with the convoy, make call signs to see how many had arrived. If their number were sufficiently high compared to the expected threat of the escorts, they would attack. This led to a series of successful pack attacks on Allied convoys in the latter half of 1940 (known as &quot;the Happy Time&quot; to the U-boat men).

===Drawbacks===
While the German pack tactic was effective, it had several drawbacks. Most notably, wolfpacks required extensive radio communication to coordinate the attacks. This left the U-boats vulnerable to a device called the High Frequency Direction Finder (HF/DF or &quot;Huff-Duff&quot;), which allowed Allied naval forces to determine the location of the enemy boats transmitting and attack them.

The pack tactic was able to bring about a force concentration against a convoy but no tactics for co-ordinated attack were developed; each commander present was left to move against the convoy as he saw fit. The escort groups developed group tactics against U-boat attack, gaining an advantage. As packs got larger the risks from this lack of co-ordination increased, such as overlapping attacks, collision or friendly fire incidents (in May 1943 for example, two U-boats stalking a Gibraltar convoy, and collided, with the loss of both).

Away from the Atlantic, the U-boat Arm had less scope for pack attacks; Operation Drumbeat against US shipping in early 1942, off the US eastern coast, and Operation Neuland in the Caribbean, were conducted by U-boats on individual patrol, until the introduction of a convoy system there saw the U-boats withdraw to easier hunting grounds. In the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean individual routing by the Allies and small numbers of U-boats active there again saw the employment of the lone wolf approach by the U-boat Arm.

===Countermeasures===

Although the wolfpacks proved a serious threat to Allied shipping, the Allies developed counter-measures. The expansion of the escort force, and the development of well-trained and well-organized escort groups, led to more and more successes as the campaign went on. Time and again escort groups were able to fight off numerically superior packs and destroy attackers, until the rate of exchange became ruinous. Effective air cover from long-range aircraft with radar, and escort carriers and blimps, allowed U-boats to be spotted as they shadowed a convoy (waiting for the cover of night to attack).

===Naming===
Some sources refer to different wolfpacks by name or provide lists of named wolfpacks, though this can be a misnomer. Donitz’s pack tactic envisaged a patrol line of six to ten boats (later, twenty to thirty or more) across a convoy route to search for targets. If a convoy was found the boats would form a pack, to mount a simultaneous attack. At the outbreak of the Second World War Germany had had 27 sea- and ocean-going U-boats, enough to mount a single patrol line in the Atlantic. Patrol lines were not named and if a pack was formed it was referred to by the name of the skipper who had found the target. This situation improved with the fall of France and the occupation of the French Atlantic ports but U-boat construction had barely kept pace with losses and it was not until the summer of 1941 that several patrol groups were possible, creating the need to differentiate them. At first this was by location (West, Centre, South, Greenland) but in August began to assign codenames, chosen for their historical or cultural value. This continued until the end of the campaign, though after the spring of 1944 the had moved away from pack attacks to its inshore campaign of individual patrols operating in British coastal waters. The last named U-boat group was , a seven boat operation against the North American coast, countered by the USN with Operation Teardrop.

The codename applied to the group or to the patrol line that they formed. Not all groups so named were involved in pack tactics; the group was formed to enter the Mediterranean and support operations there; group were dispatched to the waters off South Africa, where they operated independently. Of those groups forming patrol lines not all found convoys or were able to form packs if they did. Where a named group formed and mounted a pack attack on a convoy, referring to it by name as a wolfpack is appropriate.

==American submarines in World War II==

In the Pacific the United States Navy (USN) used individual patrol and pack tactics; the South West Pacific command (SoWePac) under Rear-Admiral Ralph Christie, based at Brisbane and Fremantle favoured the individual patrol, while the Central Pacific command, under Rear Admiral Charles Lockwood at Pearl Harbor (SubPac) used the pack tactic.

===Tactics===
American wolfpacks, called &quot;coordinated attack groups&quot;, usually comprised three boats that patrolled in close company and organized before they left port under the command of the senior captain of the three. &quot;Swede&quot; Momsen devised the tactics and led the first American wolfpack – composed of , and – from Midway on 1 October 1943. In this way the USN was able to make command at sea work; by forming stable groups of three submarines, these groups were able to develop group tactics for attack on Japanese convoys.

===Naming===
Part of this development, and to promote an , was naming the groups as they formed. These names were based on that of the group commander; the group comprising (Cdr. &quot;Ben&quot; Oakley), and were known as &quot;Ben&#x27;s Busters&quot;; the group , , and were &quot;Blakely&#x27;s Behemoths&quot;.

==Cold War==
Wolfpacks fell out of use during the Cold War as the role of the submarine changed. With trade returned to peacetime conditions and the end of convoying, the submarine ceased to be a commerce raider and moved to a range of more traditional military roles, such as scouting, intelligence-gathering, clandestine transport and in the event of a full-scale war, fleet operations. The USN deploys its attack submarines on individual patrols, with the exception of one or (rarely) two attack submarines in each carrier strike group.

American ballistic missile submarines have always operated alone, while Soviet ballistic missile submarines operated in well-protected bastions.

==Post-Cold War==
To date the world&#x27;s navies continue to deploy their submarines on individual patrols.

<text>Sinfest is a long-running daily American comic strip by Tatsuya Ishida. It originally appeared in the &quot;Daily Bruin&quot; student newspaper between 1991 and 1994. Ishida relaunched the comic strip in 2000 by self-publishing it online as a webcomic. &quot;Sinfest&quot; has also been collected into five printed books; Dark Horse Comics published two of them, in 2009 and 2011.

The comic has received mixed reactions over the years on its inclusion of topics such as race, feminism, politics and sexism. The themes and tone of the comic have shifted multiple times over the years, with the 1990s incarnation being regarded as especially crass. The 2000s comics are often black comedy, with references made to pop culture, and in 2008, the comics began incorporating even more political and ideological themes, including radical feminism (starting in 2011). By the 2020s, the comic underwent a change in a direction which caused the author to be banned from Patreon and Twitter for hateful content.

==History==
===Launch and transition from print to online publication===

&quot;Sinfest&quot; was initially published by the University of California, Los Angeles&#x27; &quot;Daily Bruin&quot; from October 16, 1991, to 1994. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described these strips as even &quot;raunchier and harsher&quot; than &quot;Sinfest&quot; comics from the early 2000s. In 2009, Ishida said he wanted to create comics after reading a &quot;Peanuts&quot; paperback as a child, due to &quot;the simplicity and solitary nature of the medium.&quot; Following this phase of &quot;Sinfest&quot;, Ishida briefly worked as penciller for Dark Horse Comics&#x27; &quot;G.I. Joe Extreme&quot; (published 1995–6).

In 2000, Ishida taught himself HTML, put together a Geocities web page, and started uploading &quot;Sinfest&quot; strips seven days per week. Ishida has said that he maintained a 7-day-a-week schedule during the first seven years through &quot;coffee and revenge&quot;. In 2013, Author Sean Kleefeld described some of the earliest strips as using &quot;racial stereotypes&quot; that are &quot;racially insensitive at best&quot; and &quot;insulting and degrading.&quot; Ishida, who lives a private life and has little interaction with his readership, has said that &quot;Sinfest&quot; has included political views that have led to reader complaints since its early comics. Writing for &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, comics-writer Shaenon Garrity has described how the comic has included &quot;a lot of offensive material over the years, including racial caricatures, sex and drug humor, and lots of sexism.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Comics Beat&quot;, journalist Laura Sneddon stated that, during this period, &quot;the comic was indeed a Sin-fest, stuffed with black comedy and poking outrage for humour&quot;. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine described it as a four-panel comic strip relying on pop culture references and dark humor. &quot;Sinfest&quot; was nominated for three Web Cartoonists&#x27; Choice Awards in 2004.

The comic&#x27;s art-style resembles chibi. According to Garrity, it can get away with offensive material for being &quot;darn cute&quot;, and she and Kleefeld both commended the art-work. Early characters included Slick, something of a main-character and a hedonistic womanizer, resembling Bill Watterson&#x27;s Calvin. His side-kick was it girl Monique, Garrity describes her as a &quot;sexy coffeehouse poet&quot; and recounts her spending &quot;one of her earliest strips in a bikini, showing her ass to the reader&quot;. Other early characters included God and the Devil.

Ishida self-published three print volumes of &quot;Sinfest&quot; between 2002 and 2005. Two volumes of early &quot;Sinfest&quot; have been published in print by Dark Horse Comics. The first of these was released in mid-2009 and reprints the first year of the webcomic. Dark Horse planned another book release in late 2009, but that book was cancelled due to the poor sales of the first book. The second volume, a 2011 collection titled &quot;Viva la Resistance&quot;, covers the webcomic&#x27;s run from 2003 to 2004. &quot;Sinfest&quot; has also appeared in the Norwegian comic magazine &quot;Nemi&quot;.

During the 2008 United States presidential election, &quot;Sinfest&quot; incorporated even more political themes. Critic R. C. Harvey wrote in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; in 2009 that it was the best webcomic around, and that &quot;It borders on the blasphemous, but uproariously so. Surely we deserve to be offended in so hilarious a fashion.&quot; Ishida has said that he switches between characters and situations in his webcomic &quot;pretty much on a whim&quot;, saying that &quot;the longer storylines help to pull it all together.&quot; In 2011, Ishida started to produce weekly strips in color on Sundays, giving readers, in his words, &quot;something extra fun and engaging&quot;.

===Later changes in direction and themes===
In October 2011, the comic abruptly shifted in tone, focusing heavily on radical feminist themes. Ishida introduced new characters to explore these new themes, and to confront the humor in older strips. Over its first decade as a webcomic it evolved into a more serious work, with a large cast of regular characters commenting on such themes as organized religion, American exceptionalism, and economic insecurity. It abruptly shifted focus to radical feminism in 2011, tackling issues such as slut-shaming, misogyny, and street harassment. In this period, Monique cut her hair and began questioning gender roles and patriarchy as a system of oppression, the latter depicted as a &quot;Matrix&quot;-like oppressive simulated reality. Sneddon compared the comic&#x27;s themes in this period to &quot;I Was Kidnapped By Lesbian Pirates From Outer Space&quot;, another feminist webcomic, noting that &quot;Sinfest&quot; had a larger audience—inherited from before the change in direction; however, some of these old fans were outraged by the changes to Monique.

Garrity said in 2012 that &quot;raunchy strips about strippers are followed by cute cat-and-dog gags are followed by religious humor are followed by autobio strips are followed by shit-stirring political cartoons are followed by spoken-word poetry are followed by lessons in drawing Japanese kanji, one of &quot;Sinfest&quot;’s signature running features&quot;, and that &quot;&quot;Sinfest&quot; is always, first and foremost, about what Ishida wants to cartoon at any given moment.&quot; &quot;PC Magazine&quot; listed &quot;Sinfest&quot; among the best webcomics of 2015. Ishida said in 2017, &quot;Over the years [Sinfest] has gone through many changes, to the delight of some and dismay of others. I hope to continue polarizing audiences for many years to come.&quot; Kleefeld wrote in 2020 that &quot;The message of social justice through radical feminism is still the strip&#x27;s raison d&#x27;etre, but it&#x27;s a message of safety and inclusion rather than one of outreach and education.&quot;

In April 2022, Journalist Ryan Broderick noted the addition of &quot;long-running internet conspiracies, like the Illuminati and the Bilderberg group&quot; (by the early-2010s), the MAGA movement (2016+), anti-trans storylines (2019+), and QAnon (2021+), and opined that &quot;as of now, the comic is a Christian fascist slurry of random internet nonsense.&quot; In September of that year, Ishida wrote that he was locked out of Twitter for &quot;hateful conduct&quot;, in reference to his September 3 strip. In December 2022, Ishida wrote that he was banned from Patreon for promoting &quot;sentiments of discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation&quot;; he had started the &quot;sinfest&quot; account on January 8, 2018.

In 2024, Kleefeld wrote that when catching up on &quot;Sinfest&quot; strips, he &quot;wasn&#x27;t understanding them&quot;, and that the comic had gone into a &quot;downward spiral&quot;.

<text>Hildasay (; ) (from the Old Norse masculine name &quot;Hildir&quot; with &quot;ey&quot; &quot;island&quot;), also known as Hildisay, is an uninhabited island off the west coast of the Shetland Mainland.


==Geography and geology==
Hildasay has an area of , and is in elevation at its highest point. It consists of red-green granite (epidotic syenite) that was quarried for many years.

The south coast has two narrow inlets, Cusa Voe and Tangi Voe. &quot;West&quot;, the larger of two lochs, has a single islet. A satellite island, Linga lies to the south east. A long line of skerries and holms lies to the north west.

==History==
Hildasay has been uninhabited since the late nineteenth century, but as late as 1891 had a population of 30. The island&#x27;s former industries included curing herring and quarrying granite. The remains of a railway line leading from the quarry to the harbour can still be seen.

As of 2020 there was one house on the island, which was temporarily occupied by charity walker Chris Lewis and his dog Jet when movement restrictions were imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>Jack Warden (born John Warden Lebzelter Jr.; September 18, 1920July 19, 2006) was an American actor who worked in film and television. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975) and &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978). He received a BAFTA nomination for &quot;Shampoo&quot;, and won a Primetime Emmy Award for his performance in &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot; (1971).

==Early life==
Warden was born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of Laura M. (&quot;née&quot; Costello) and John Warden Lebzelter, who was an engineer and technician. 
He was of Pennsylvania Dutch (German) and Irish ancestry. Raised in Louisville, Kentucky, he was expelled from high school for fighting and eventually fought as a professional boxer under the name Johnny Costello. He fought in 13 bouts as a welterweight, but earned little money.

==Military service==
Warden worked as a nightclub bouncer, tugboat deckhand, and lifeguard, before joining the United States Navy in 1938. He was stationed for three years in China with the Yangtze Patrol.

Warden joined the United States Merchant Marine in 1941, but he quickly tired of the long convoy runs.

In 1942, Warden moved to the United States Army, where he served as a paratrooper in the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, with the 101st Airborne Division in World War II.

In 1944, on the eve of the D-Day invasion (in which many of his friends died), Warden, then a staff sergeant, shattered his leg when he landed in a tree during a night-time practice jump in England. He spent almost eight months in the hospital recuperating, during which time he read a Clifford Odets play and decided to become an actor. Notably, Warden later portrayed a paratrooper from the 101st&#x27;s rivals—the 82nd Airborne Division—in &quot;That Kind of Woman&quot;.

After leaving the army, Warden moved to New York City and studied acting on the G.I. Bill.

==Career==

Warden joined the company of the Theatre &#x27;47 of Dallas and moved there and performed on stage there for five years. In 1948, he made his television debut on the anthology series &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot; and also appeared on the series &quot;Studio One&quot;. His first film roles were uncredited bit parts in the 1950 films &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; and &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, and he was also in the 1951 film &quot;You&#x27;re in the Navy Now&quot;, which also featured the screen debuts of Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson.
Warden appeared in his first credited film role in 1951 in &quot;The Man with My Face&quot;.

From 1952 to 1955, Warden appeared in the television series &quot;Mister Peepers&quot; with Wally Cox. In 1953, he was cast as a sympathetic corporal in &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;. Warden&#x27;s breakthrough film role was Juror No. 7, a salesman who wants a quick decision in a murder case, in &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;.

Warden guest-starred in many television series over the years, such as Marilyn Maxwell&#x27;s ABC drama series, &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, and on David Janssen&#x27;s ABC drama, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. He received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his performance as Chicago Bears coach George Halas in the television movie, &quot;Brian&#x27;s Song&quot;, and was twice nominated for his starring role in the 1980s comedy/drama series &quot;Crazy Like a Fox&quot;.

Warden was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor twice: for his performances in &quot;Shampoo&quot; and &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;. He also had notable roles in &quot;Bye Bye Braverman&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing&quot;, &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, &quot;The White Buffalo&quot;, &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;, &quot;Being There&quot;, &quot;Used Cars&quot; (in which he played dual roles), &quot;The Verdict&quot;, &quot;Problem Child&quot; and its sequel, as well as &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot;, &quot;Guilty as Sin&quot; and the Norm Macdonald comedy &quot;Dirty Work&quot;. His final film was &quot;The Replacements&quot; in 2000, opposite Gene Hackman and Keanu Reeves.

==Personal life==
Warden married French actress Vanda Dupre on October 10, 1958. They had one son, Christopher. Although they separated in the late 1970s, the couple never legally divorced.

Warden&#x27;s health declined in his later years, which resulted in his retirement from acting in 2000. He lived for the rest of his life in Manhattan, New York City, with his girlfriend, Marucha Hinds.

==Death==
Warden died of heart and kidney failure in a New York City hospital on July 19, 2006, at the age of 85.

<text>New Georgia, with an area of , is the largest of the islands in Western Province, Solomon Islands, and the 203rd-largest island in the world. Since July 1978, the island has been part of the independent state of Solomon Islands.

==Geography==

New Georgia island is located in the New Georgia Group, an archipelago including most of the other larger islands in the province. The island measures approximately long by wide. New Georgia forms part of the southern boundary of the New Georgia Sound. Kolombangara lies across the Kula Gulf to the west, Choiseul to the northeast, Vangunu is to the southeast, and Rendova to the southwest, across the Blanche Channel.

New Georgia is a volcanic island, surrounded in some places by a coral reef. The highest point is Mount Masse, with an elevation of .

The climate is wet and tropical, and the island is subject to frequent cyclones. New Georgia is covered with dense vegetation, in the marshy areas mangroves are located.

==Population==
The population of the island was 19,312 in 1999. Most of the population resides on the south coast; however, the main settlement is the village of Munda, located in the west. On the southeastern coast is the village of Sege. The islanders speak several Melanesian languages. The ten languages spoken on the island are from the family of New Georgia languages, a subgroup of the Northwest Solomonic languages within the Oceanic languages, a major group of the Austronesian family.

The Kalikoqu is a tribe in the Roviana Lagoon on the southern side of New Georgia Island; the larger tribal polities are the chief districts of Saikile and Kalikoqu.

==History==
The central part of New Georgia is the cradle of Roviana culture. A large complex of megalithic shrines and other structures was developed in the 13th century AD. Later, between the 15th and 17th centuries Roviana people moved over to smaller barrier islands at New Georgia with a hub in Nusa Roviana. Through trade and headhunting expeditions, Nusa Roviana turned into the regional centre of power and trade.

The island was named New Georgia, by John Shortland when his ship, the &quot;Alexander&quot;, passed by it in August 1789 when returning to England in command of four vessels of the First Fleet.

On March 15, 1893, Captain Herbert Gibson of , declared New Georgia to be part of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. 

The Colonial Office appointed Charles Morris Woodford as the Resident Commissioner in the Solomon Islands on 17 February 1897. He was directed to control the labour trade operating in the Solomon Island waters and to stop the illegal trade in firearms. Arthur Mahaffy was appointed as the Deputy Commissioner to Woodford in January 1898. In January 1900, Mahaffy established a government station at Gizo, as Woodford considered Mahaffy’s military training as making him suitable for the role of suppressing headhunting in New Georgia and neighbouring islands. Mahaffy had a force of twenty-five police officers armed with rifles, who were recruited from the islands of Malaita, Savo and Isabel. The first target of this force was chief Ingava of the Roviana Lagoon of New Georgia who had been raiding Choiseul and Isabel and killing or enslaving hundreds of people.

Mahaffy and the police officers under his command carried out a violent and ruthless suppression of headhunting, with his actions having the support of Woodford and the Western Pacific High Commission, who wanted to eradicate headhunting and complete a “pacification” of the western Solomon Islands through punitive expeditions. Mahaffy seized and destroyed large war canoes (&quot;tomokos&quot;). One of which was used to transport the police officers. The western Solomon Islands were substantially pacified by 1902. During this time Mahaffy acquired artefacts held in high value by the Solomon Islanders for his personal collection. 

The Methodist Mission in New Georgia was established by Rev. John Frances Goldie in 1902. He dominated the mission and gained the loyalty of Solomon Islander members of his church. The relationship with the colonial administrators of the British Solomon Island Protectorate were also fraught with difficulty, at this time due to Goldie’s effective control over the Western Solomon Islands.

From 1927 to 1934 Dr Edward Sayers worked at the Methodist mission where he established a hospital at Munda and carried out fieldwork in the treatment of malaria.

=== World War II ===

The island was occupied by the Empire of Japan in the early stages of World War II. During Pacific War, the United States&#x27; New Georgia Campaign opened with landings on New Georgia and nearby islands on 30 June 1943. New Georgia was secured by American forces on 23 August, after weeks of difficult and bloody jungle fighting, although fighting continued on some nearby islands until October 1943.

Munda, the Japanese base on New Georgia Island, was the main objective of the assault on the island. This base was not overrun until 5 August 1943. The Japanese port at Bairoko Harbor, north of Munda, was not taken until 25 August.

Donald Gilbert Kennedy was a Coastwatcher stationed at Seghe (Segi) on New Georgia during the Solomon Islands campaign during the Pacific War.

<text>Lake breakout is the collapse of a lake, usually of high-altitude. High-altitude lakes tend to form in volcanic craters – where they are called crater lakes – or in valleys dammed as the result of earthquakes or glacial or volcanic deposition. Lake breakouts are most common a few weeks or months after a volcanic eruption as a river becomes blocked by volcanic debris.

==Process==
The walls of such lakes can be unstable and may be breached after fresh earthquakes or because of erosion. As water rushes outwards, the initial channel is cut wider and deeper, further increasing the flow. This may cause the lake&#x27;s rim to collapse abruptly. The usual result is for huge amounts of water to be displaced, incorporating a great deal of sediment which increases it in volume by as much as two or four times, or even more. This produces violent floods and lahars with devastating effects for any settlements in their path.

==Historical events==
The larger a temporary lake is, the more extreme the likely breakout will be. One of the largest known to have occurred in recent geological history was the collapse, around 15,000 years ago, of the ancient Lake Bonneville which was filled with meltwater from the last ice age and covered large areas of Utah, Idaho and Nevada. Erosion broke through the lake shore&#x27;s lowest point, the Red Rock Pass in Idaho, releasing as much as 1,000 mile3 (4,000 km3) of water within a period estimated to have lasted only two weeks. The energies released by the outburst were capable not just of stripping surface features, but gouging out bedrock to a depth of many feet. It drastically reshaped the landscape downstream, carving out many of the features of the Snake River and its surrounding area. Glacial Lake Missoula also had lake breakouts, due to breaking of ice dams, see Missoula Floods. These lake breakouts caused extensive erosion throughout eastern Washington.
It has been suggested that gigantic breakouts from underground lakes may have been responsible for carving some of the canyons of Mars.

==Mitigation==
Although there is little that can be done about many lake breakouts, some have been prevented (or at least delayed) by human intervention. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens blocked nearby Castle Creek, forming a lake which geologists feared would produce a sudden lahar. The United States Army Corps of Engineers excavated an outlet channel which prevented the lake from overtopping its new debris dam.

<text>The Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is the civilian foreign intelligence agency of Russia. The SVR succeeded the First Chief Directorate of the KGB in December 1991. The SVR has its headquarters in the Yasenevo District of Moscow with its director reporting directly to the President of the Russian Federation.

Unlike the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the SVR is tasked with intelligence and espionage activities outside the Russian Federation. A small service, it works collaboratively with its military intelligence counterpart, the Main Intelligence Directorate, better known as the GRU. As of 1997, the GRU reportedly deployed six times as many spies in foreign countries as the SVR. The SVR is authorized to negotiate intelligence-sharing arrangements with foreign governments, particularly on matters of counterterrorism, and is tasked with providing finished intelligence products to the Russian president.

Any information pertaining to specific identities of staff employees (officers) of the SVR is considered a state secret; since September 2018, the same protection has applied to non-staff personnel (i.e., agents, informants, or cooptees.)

==History==

SVR RF is the official foreign-operations successor to many prior Soviet-era foreign intelligence agencies, ranging from the original &#x27;foreign department&#x27; of the Cheka under Vladimir Lenin, to the OGPU and NKVD of the Stalinist era, followed by the First Chief Directorate of the KGB.

Officially, the SVR RF dates its own beginnings to the founding of the Special Section of the Cheka on 20 December 1920. The head of the Cheka, Felix Dzerzhinsky, created the Foreign Department (&quot;Inostranny Otdel&quot; – INO) to improve the collection as well as the dissemination of foreign intelligence. On 6 February 1922, the Foreign Department of the Cheka became part of a renamed organization, the &quot;State Political Directorate&quot;, or GPU. The Foreign Department was placed in charge of intelligence activities overseas, including collection of important intelligence from foreign countries and the liquidation of defectors, emigres, and other assorted &#x27;enemies of the people&#x27;. In 1922, after the creation of the State Political Directorate (GPU) and its merger with the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs of the RSFSR, foreign intelligence was conducted by the GPU Foreign Department, and between December 1923 and July 1934 by the Foreign Department of Joint State Political Administration or OGPU. In July 1934, the OGPU was reincorporated into the NKVD. In 1954, the NKVD in turn became the KGB, which in 1991 became SVR and FSB.

In 1996, the SVR RF issued a CD-ROM entitled &quot;Russian Foreign Intelligence: VChK–KGB–SVR&quot;, which claims to provide &quot;a professional view on the history and development of one of the most powerful secret services in the world&quot; where all services are presented as one evolving organization.

Former Director of the SVR RF Sergei Lebedev stated &quot;there has not been any place on the planet where a KGB officer has not been&quot;. During their 80th anniversary celebration, Vladimir Putin went to SVR headquarters to meet with other former KGB/SVR chiefs Vladimir Kryuchkov, Leonid Shebarshin, Yevgeny Primakov, and Vyacheslav Trubnikov, as well as other agents, including the British double agent and ex-Soviet spy George Blake.

==Legal authority==
The &quot;Law on Foreign Intelligence&quot; was written by the SVR leadership itself and adopted in August 1992. This Law provided conditions for &quot;penetration by checkists of all levels of the government and economy&quot;, since it stipulated that &quot;career personnel may occupy positions in ministries, departments, establishments, enterprises and organizations in accordance with the requirements of this law without compromising their association with foreign intelligence agencies.&quot;

A new &quot;Law on Foreign Intelligence Organs&quot; was passed by the State Duma and the Federation Council in late 1995 and signed into effect by the then-President Boris Yeltsin on 10 January 1996. The law authorizes the SVR to carry out the following:

# Conduct intelligence;
# Implement active measures to ensure Russia&#x27;s security;
# Conduct military, strategic, economic, scientific and technological espionage;
# Protect employees of Russian institutions overseas and their families;
# Provide personal security for Russian government officials and their families;
# Conduct joint operations with foreign security services;
# Conduct electronic surveillance in foreign countries.

The SVR sends to the Russian president daily digests of intelligence, similar to the President&#x27;s Daily Brief produced by the United States Intelligence Community in the US. However, unlike in the US, the SVR recommends to the president which policy options are preferable.

Since 2012, the President of the Russian Federation can personally issue any secret orders to the SVR RF without consulting the parliament of national legislature, the Federal Assembly, which consists of the State Duma and Federation Council.

==Command structure==
According to Article 12 of the 1996 Federal Law &quot;On Foreign Intelligence&quot;, &quot;overall direction&quot; of external intelligence activity is executed by the president of Russia, who appoints the Director of the SVR.

The director provides regular briefings to the president. The director is a permanent member of the Security Council of Russia and the Defense Council.

According to published sources, the SVR included the following directorates in the 1990s:

* Directorate PR: Political Intelligence: Included seventeen departments, each responsible for different countries of the world (espionage in the US, Canada, Latin America, etc.)
* Directorate S: Illegal Intelligence: Included thirteen departments responsible for preparing and planting &quot;illegal agents&quot; abroad, &quot;biological espionage&quot;, recruitment of foreign citizens on the Russian territory and other duties.
* Directorate X: Scientific and Technical Intelligence
* Directorate KR: External Counter-Intelligence: This Directorate &quot;carries out infiltration of foreign intelligence and security services and exercises surveillance over Russian citizens abroad.&quot;
* Directorate OT: Operational and Technical Support
* Directorate R: Operational Planning and Analysis: Evaluates SVR operations abroad.
* Directorate I: Computer Service (Information and Dissemination): Analyzes and distributes intelligence data and publishes a daily current events summaries for the president.
* Directorate of Economic Intelligence

According to the SVR RF web site, the organization currently consists of a director, a first deputy director (who oversees the directions for Foreign Counterintelligence and Economic Intelligence) and the following departments:
*Personnel;
*Operations;
*Analysis &amp; Information (formerly Intelligence Institute);
*Science;
*Operational Logistics &amp; Support.

Each directorate is headed by a deputy director who reports to the SVR Director. The Red Banner Intelligence Academy has been renamed the Academy of Foreign Intelligence (ABP are its Russian initials) and is housed in the Science Directorate.

==Involvement in Russian foreign policy==
During Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s presidency, the SVR conflicted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for directing Russian foreign policy. SVR director Yevgeni Primakov upstaged the foreign ministry by publishing warnings to the West not to interfere in the unification of Russia with other former Soviet republics and attacking the NATO extension as a threat to Russian security, whereas foreign minister Andrey Kozyrev was requesting different things. The rivalry ended in decisive victory for the SVR, when Primakov replaced Kozyrev in January 1996 and brought with him a number of SVR officers to the foreign ministry of Russia.

In September 1999, Yeltsin admitted that the SVR played a greater role in Russian foreign policy than the Foreign Ministry. It was reported that the SVR defined the Russian position on the transfer of nuclear technologies to Iran, NATO expansion, and modification of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The SVR also tried to justify annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union in World War II using selectively declassified documents.

=== Sanctions ===
Sanctioned in May 2023 by the United States Department of the Treasury pursuant to E.O. 14024 for being a political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of the Government of the Russian Federation.

==Operations==

===Espionage===
From the end of the 1980s, KGB and later SVR began to create &quot;a second echelon&quot; of &quot;auxiliary agents in addition to our main weapons, illegals and special agents&quot;, according to former SVR officer Kouzminov. These agents are legal immigrants, including scientists and other professionals. Another SVR officer who defected to Britain in 1996 described several &quot;thousand&quot; Russian agents and intelligence officers, some of them &quot;illegals&quot; who live under deep cover abroad.

Between 1994 and 2001, high-profile cases of Americans working as sources (&#x27;spies&#x27;) for Russian agencies included those of Aldrich Hazen Ames, Harold James Nicholson, Earl Edwin Pitts, Robert Philip Hanssen and George Trofimoff. They would be considered double agents because they were working for American intelligence agencies while providing information to Russia. They were not Russian &#x27;illegals&#x27; however, because they were American citizens.

===Cooperation with foreign intelligence services===
An agreement on intelligence cooperation between Russia and China was signed in 1992. This secret treaty covers cooperation of the GRU GSh VS RF and the SVR RF with the China&#x27;s Intelligence Bureau of the Joint Staff Department. In 2003 it was reported that SVR RF trained Iraqi spies when Russia collaborated with Saddam Hussein. The SVR also has cooperation agreements with the secret police services of certain former Soviet republics, such as Azerbaijan and Belarus.

===Assassinations abroad===

&quot;In the Soviet era, the SVR – then part of the KGB – handled covert political assassinations abroad&quot;. These activities reportedly continue. It was reported in September 2003 that an SVR RF agent in London was making preparations to assassinate Boris Berezovsky with a binary weapon, which is why Berezovsky had been speedily granted asylum in Britain. GRU officers who killed Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in Qatar in 2004 reportedly claimed that supporting SVR agents let them down by not evacuating them in time, so they have been arrested by Qatar authorities.

Former KGB agent Igor the Assassin, who is believed to have been the poisoner of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006, was allegedly an SVR officer. However, SVR denied involvement in the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. An SVR spokesperson queried over Litvinenko remarked: &quot;May God give him health.&quot; The SVR was reportedly involved in the likely assassination of Maxim Kuzminov.

===Special Operations Department of the SVR &quot;Zaslon&quot;===
Zaslon () is a special forces unit in the SVR which was created by secret decree on 23 March 1997, and reached operational readiness in 1998. Units were deployed to the Russian embassies in Iraq at Baghdad, Iran and Syria at Damascus to support protection of diplomats and other tasks. Zaslon was criticized following the 19 December 2016 assassination in Ankara of Andrei Karlov who was the Russian ambassador to Turkey.

===Internet disinformation===
According to senior SVR officer Sergei Tretyakov, he often sent intelligence officers to branches of the New York Public Library where they gained access to the Internet without anyone knowing their identity. They placed propaganda and disinformation on educational websites and sent emails to US broadcasters. The articles or studies were generated by Russian experts who worked for the SVR. The purpose of these active measures was to whitewash Russian foreign policy, create a positive image of Russia, promote anti-American feelings and &quot;to cause dissension and unrest inside the US&quot;.

==Recruitment==
The SVR RF actively recruits Russian citizens who live in foreign countries.
&quot;Once the SVR officer targets a Russian émigré for recruitment, they approach them, usually at their place of residence and make an effort to reach an understanding,&quot; said former FSB officer Aleksander Litvinenko.

These claims have not been confirmed by the official SVR website, which states that only Russian citizens without dual citizenship can become SVR RF agents.

Russian intelligence no longer recruits people on the basis of Communist ideals, which was the &quot;first pillar&quot; of KGB recruitment, said analyst Konstantin Preobrazhenskiy. &quot;The second pillar of recruitment is love for Russia. In the West, only Russian immigrants have feelings of filial obedience toward Russia. That’s precisely why [the SVR] works with them so often. A special division was created just for this purpose. It regularly holds Russian immigrant conferences, which Putin is fond of attending.&quot;

==Notable Russian intelligence officers and agents==
* February 1994: Aldrich Hazen Ames was charged with providing highly classified information since April 1985 to the Soviet Union and then Russia. The information he passed led to the execution of at least 9 United States agents in Russia. In April, he and his wife pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit espionage and to evading taxes. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

* November 1996: Harold James Nicholson was arrested while attempting to take top secret documents out of the United States. He began spying for Russia in 1994. He was a senior-ranking Central Intelligence Agency officer. In 1997, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to more than 23 years in prison.
* December 1996: Earl Edwin Pitts was charged with providing top secret documents to the Soviet Union and then Russia from 1987 until 1992. In 1997, he pleaded guilty to two counts of espionage and was sentenced to 27 years in prison.
* June 2000: George Trofimoff, a naturalized US citizen of Russian parents, was arrested for spying for the Soviet Union and Russia since about 1969. Having retired as a colonel in the United States Army Reserve, he was the highest-ranking military officer ever accused of spying. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.
* 1991: Vladimir Gruzdev joined the SVR. However, Gruzdev stayed in the service for only two years.
* October 2000: Sergei Tretyakov, an SVR officer working undercover at the Russian UN mission defected to the United States with his family.
* February 2001: Robert Philip Hanssen was arrested for spying for the Soviet Union and Russia for more than 15 years of his 27 years with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He passed thousands of pages of classified documents on nuclear war defenses and Sensitive Compartmented Information and exposed three Russian agents of the United States, two of whom were tried and executed. He pleaded guilty to espionage and was sentenced to life in prison.
* June 2010: With the breakup of known parts of the Illegals Program, 10 individuals who allegedly carried on deep-cover espionage activities were arrested by FBI, and an eleventh was arrested while attempting to transit through Cyprus. These individuals were purportedly working for the SVR on long term covert assignments in penetrating policy making circles in the United States government. An agent going by the name of Christopher Metsos is still being sought by the authorities; the agents arrested on 28 June 2010 include Mikhail Semenko, Vladimir Guryev, Lidiya Guryev, Andrey Bezrukov, Yelena Vavilova, Mikhail Kutsik, Nataliya Pereverzeva, Mikhail Anatolyevich Vasenkov, Vicky Pelaez, and Anna Chapman. A twelfth man, Alexey Karetnikov, was deported later. They were revealed by SVR defector Deputy Head of illegal spies, Colonel Alexander Poteyev.

<text>William Mark Price (born February 15, 1964) is an American former professional basketball player and coach. He was most recently the head coach of the Charlotte 49ers. As a player, he played for 12 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), from 1986 to 1998. Spending the majority of his career with the Cleveland Cavaliers, his last three years consisted of one season each with the Washington Bullets, Golden State Warriors, and Orlando Magic.

==College career==
Standing at 6 feet (183 cm) tall, Price played college basketball at Georgia Tech. During his time playing on the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men&#x27;s basketball team, he was a three-time All American and four-time All ACC basketball player who helped lead the Yellow Jackets to an ACC Championship his junior year by defeating North Carolina in the ACC Tournament championship game. He was named the ACC Player of the Year for the 1984–85 season and his jersey was retired. He was inducted into the school&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1991 and into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 2005. Price graduated in four years with a degree in Industrial Management.

===College records===
* All-time Georgia Tech leader in 3-point field goal percentage (.440, 1983–86)
* All-time Georgia Tech leader in steals (240, 1983–86)
* All-time Georgia Tech leader in consecutive games started (126, 1983–86)
* All-time Georgia Tech leader in minutes played (4,604, 1983–86)

==Professional career==
A point guard, he mystified critics who said he was too slow, too small and too deliberate for a high-level game. Selected first in the second round (25th overall) by the Dallas Mavericks in the 1986 NBA draft, he was acquired by the Cleveland Cavaliers in a draft day trade that helped turn the team into an Eastern Conference powerhouse.

===Cleveland Cavaliers===
Price was known as one of the league&#x27;s most consistent shooters. He finished his career with a 90.4% free throw shooting percentage and a 40% three-point field goal shooting percentage. During the 1988–89 season, Price became the second player, after Larry Bird, to join the NBA&#x27;s 50–40–90 club for those who shot at least 40% from three-point range, at least 50% from the field and at least 90% from the free throw line in a single season, and is still one of only eight players to have ever done this while also achieving the NBA league minimum number of makes in each category. Price ranked consistently among the assist leaders (as of March 11, 2015, LeBron James surpassed Price&#x27;s Cavs record of 4,206 assists, taking over 1st place), twice won the Three Point Contest (in 1993 and 1994), and was a four-time All-Star. Price was named to the All-NBA First Team after the 1992–93 season. Price was second in franchise steals with 734, a Cavaliers record that stood until December 9, 2008, when LeBron James surpassed him.

Another one of Price&#x27;s distinguishing traits on the court was his pioneering of the splitting of the double team. As former teammate Steve Kerr explains, &quot;Mark really revolutionized the way that people attack the screen and roll. To me, he was the first guy in the NBA who really split the screen and roll. A lot of teams started blitzing the pick and roll and jumping two guys at it to take the ball out of the hands of the point guard. He’d duck right between them and shoot that little runner in the lane. Nobody was doing that at that time. You watch an NBA game now and almost everybody does that. Mark was a pioneer in that regard.&quot;

===Later career===
Price was plagued by injuries late in his career, a factor in his trade to the Washington Bullets prior to the 1995–96 season. He played one season for Washington before moving on to the Golden State Warriors, signing with the Warriors as a free agent in July 1996. Price played 70 games for Golden State and averaged 11.3 points per game. On October 28, 1997, Price was traded to the Orlando Magic for David Vaughn III and Brian Shaw. He spent one season with the Magic before being waived on June 30, 1998, effectively ending his career.

==National team career==
During his career Price represented the United States national team. He played for them in the 1983 Pan American Games where the team won gold medals, and also represented the national team in the 1994 FIBA World Championship, where they were known as Dream Team II, and won gold medals.

==Legacy==
Not long after retirement, Price&#x27;s number, 25, was retired by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He is a member of the Georgia, Ohio, and Oklahoma Sports Halls of Fame.

The city of Enid, Oklahoma, renamed the basketball arena Mark Price Arena, as a tribute to the NBA player&#x27;s accomplishments, since he was one of the best basketball athletes in Enid High School history.

==Personal life==
Price&#x27;s father Denny was a successful player at Oklahoma and for the Phillips 66ers, before becoming a college coach for Sam Houston State and Phillips University. His younger brother Brent played ten seasons in the NBA. His daughter Caroline had a short stint in professional tennis after playing for the North Carolina Tar Heels. His son Josh played college basketball for Trevecca (2021–2022), after attending and playing two years for Liberty Flames. Price is a Christian and attends church.

==Coaching career==
Mark Price began his coaching career during the 1998–99 basketball season as a community coach under head coach and friend Joe Marelle at Duluth High School for the varsity boys team. After Marelle discovered he had non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, Price became a primary factor in the team&#x27;s return trip to the final four of the class 5A GHSA state tournament. It was the first time Duluth High School returned to this point in the state tournament in 16 years. Price then went on to be an assistant coach to Bobby Cremins at Georgia Tech during the 1999–2000 season.

After Cremins retired from coaching at Georgia Tech, Price then went on the following year to be the head coach at Whitefield Academy in Atlanta for the 2000–01 season leading the team to a 27–5 record and the final eight teams of the state Class A tournament, a 20 win improvement over the prior season and 27 win improvement two seasons before Price arrived. NBA player Josh Smith also played at Whitefield Academy the same season Price was coach.

In 2002, Price won the Coach Wooden &quot;Keys to Life&quot; Award.

In 2003, Price was a consultant for the NBA&#x27;s Denver Nuggets. He then became an NBA television analyst and color commentator for both the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Atlanta Hawks.

In March 2006, Price was named the inaugural head coach of the Australian NBL&#x27;s South Dragons, a new franchise for the 2006–07 season. Despite the Dragons featuring NBL Rookie of the Year Joe Ingles and four time Olympian Shane Heal they began the season 0-5 and Price was fired. Price and Heal exchanged criticisms in the Australian press after Heal was named as his successor.

Price was the shooting consultant for the Memphis Grizzlies for the 2007–08 season and named the shooting coach for the Atlanta Hawks for the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons. Price helped to improve the Hawks offensive output in their first return to the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals in nearly 10 years during the 2009 NBA Playoffs.

Price is credited with helping Boston Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo improve his jump shot. Rondo&#x27;s scoring was a key factor in the Celtics reaching the 2010 NBA Finals, where they pushed the Los Angeles Lakers to a full seven-game series. For the 2010–2011 season, Price joined the Golden State Warriors as an assistant coach with the primary task of improving the Warriors shooting and free throw percentages.

In December 2011, Price was hired as a player development coach for the Orlando Magic. In July 2012, Price served as the head coach of the Orlando Magic&#x27;s Summer League team.

On July 1, 2013, Price was hired as an assistant coach by the Charlotte Bobcats, joining the staff of head coach Steve Clifford and associate head coach Patrick Ewing for the 2013–14 season.

On March 25, 2015, Price was introduced as the head coach of the Charlotte 49ers. He replaced Coach Alan Major, who parted ways with Charlotte after two medical leaves during the past season. On December 14, 2017, it was announced that Mark Price was relieved of his duties as head coach of the Charlotte 49ers basketball program.

In September 2018, he joined the Denver Nuggets coaching staff as a shooting consultant for the 2018–19 season.

<text>High Times is an American monthly magazine (and cannabis brand) that advocates the legalization of cannabis as well as other counterculture ideas. The magazine was founded in 1974 by Tom Forcade. The magazine had its own book publishing division, High Times Books, and its own record label, High Times Records.

From 1974 to 2016, &quot;High Times&quot; was published by Trans-High Corporation (THC). Hightimes Holding Corp. acquired THC and the magazine in 2017.

== Overview ==
&quot;High Times&quot; covers a wide range of topics, including politics, activism, drugs, education, sex, music, and film, as well as photography.

Like &quot;Playboy&quot;, each issue of &quot;High Times&quot; contains a centerfold photo; however, instead of a nude woman, &quot;High Times&quot; typically features a cannabis plant. (The magazine, however, often featured women—occasionally crowned as &quot;Ms. High Times&quot;—on the cover to help newsstand sales.) In addition, the magazine &quot;published writers like Hunter S. Thompson, William S. Burroughs, Charles Bukowski, Allen Ginsberg, and Truman Capote.&quot;

==Publication history==
=== Origins ===
Forçade&#x27;s previous attempt—via the Underground Press Syndicate/Alternative Press Syndicate—to reach a wide counterculture audience of underground papers had failed, even though he had the support of several noteworthy writers, photographers, and artists. Through &quot;High Times&quot;, Forçade was able to get his message to the masses without relying on mainstream media. Forçade was quoted as saying, &quot;Those cavemen must&#x27;ve been stoned, no pun intended.&quot;

&quot;High Times&quot; was originally meant to be a joke: a single-issue lampoon of &quot;Playboy&quot;, substituting marijuana for sex. Brainstorming for the first issue&#x27;s contents was conducted by a group that included Forcade, Rex Weiner, Ed Dwyer, Robert Singer, A. J. Weberman, Dana Beal, Ed Rosenthal, the underground cartoonist Yossarian a.k.a. Alan Shenker, and Cindy Ornsteen a.k.a. Anastasia Sirocco.

The first issue, 50 pages in total, with the tagline, &quot;The Magazine of High Society,&quot; appeared in the summer of 1974. Advertising for the first issue had been pre-sold at that year&#x27;s National Fashion and Boutique Show. &quot;&quot;High Times&quot; #1 made its debut at the June 1974 show and was an instant success, selling out its first run of 10,000 copies and getting reprinted twice.&quot;

The magazine&#x27;s first editor was Ed Dwyer, who had earlier written the text of the Woodstock music festival program booklet (as well as the &quot;Woodstock&quot; film program booklet). The magazine was initially distributed by Homestead Book Company and Big Rapids Distribution.

&quot;High Times&quot; was at the beginning funded by drug money from the sale of illegal marijuana, But the magazine found an audience, becoming a monthly publication with a growing circulation, and the staff quickly grew to 40 people. Marijuana hydroponics growers were a large part of the magazine&#x27;s advertiser base.

=== Financial struggles and legal battles ===
&quot;High Times&quot; founder Forçade committed suicide in November 1978. He bequeathed trusts to benefit &quot;High Times&quot; and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML). (Forçade had been a supporter of NORML since the organization&#x27;s founding in 1970.)

Following Forçade&#x27;s death, the magazine was controlled by &quot;mostly by Forçade’s relatives&quot; and lawyer Michael John Kennedy.

Under the editorship of Larry Sloman (from 1979 to 1984),
the magazine consistently struggled against marijuana prohibition laws, and fought to keep itself alive and publishing in an anti-cannabis atmosphere. Reflecting the time period, &quot;High Times&quot; began to feature positive coverage of cocaine as a recreational drug.

The magazine&#x27;s former associate publisher, Rick Cusick, said the only way &quot;High Times&quot; managed to stay in business and never miss a publication date for over four decades was, &quot;Really, really good lawyers, even though everybody knew I was talking about just one—Michael Kennedy.&quot; Kennedy served as the general counsel and chairman of the board for &quot;High Times&quot; for over 40 years until his death in 2016, when his wife and board member, Eleanora Kennedy, took the reins.

=== Mainstream success and the Hager era ===
In 1987, &quot;High Times&quot; was audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulation as reaching 500,000 copies an issue, rivaling &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;National Lampoon&quot;.

In 1988, Steven Hager was hired as the magazine&#x27;s editor. He changed the focus from the promotion of hard drugs (e.g., cocaine and heroin), and instead concentrated on advocating personal cultivation of cannabis. Hager became the first editor to publish and promote the work of hemp activist Jack Herer.

In 1988, under Hager&#x27;s leadership, the magazine created the Cannabis Cup, a cannabis awards ceremony held every Thanksgiving in Amsterdam that later expanded to a number of U.S. cities. He also formed the High Times Freedom Fighters, the first hemp legalization group. The High Times Freedom Fighters were famous for dressing up in Colonial outfits and organizing hemp rallies across the United States. One rally, the Boston Freedom Rally, quickly became the largest marijuana-related political event in the country, drawing an audience of over 30,00 to the Boston Common in 2013.

The magazine advocated for the widespread use of hemp in the 1990s, publishing a quarterly magazine called &quot;Hemp Times&quot; and operating a retail location in Manhattan called Planet Hemp.

In 1991, the magazine began featuring celebrities on the cover of the magazine. Over the years, these included Cypress Hill, The Black Crowes, Ziggy Marley, Beavis and Butt-Head, Milla Jovovich, Ice Cube, Wu-Tang Clan, George Carlin, Ozzy Osbourne, Kevin Smith, Frances McDormand, Pauly Shore, Sacha Baron Cohen, Willie Nelson, Woody Harrelson, and Snoop Dogg.

In 1997, the magazine and Hager founded the Counterculture Hall of Fame, with inductions held annually on Thanksgiving as part of the Amsterdam Cannabis Cup event.

In the late 1980s Mike Edison began writing &quot;Shoot the Tube,&quot; a featured column about television and politics for &quot;High Times&quot;. In 1998 Edison was named the magazine&#x27;s publisher, and later took control of the editorial side of the magazine as well. As editor and publisher, he caused a furor among staffers by putting Black Sabbath singer Ozzy Osbourne on the cover, and then leaking to the &quot;New York Post&quot;″s Page Six gossip column that thousands of dollars of pot had gone missing from the photo shoot. After taking the magazine to new heights in sales and advertising, Edison was instrumental in producing &quot;High Times&quot;″ first feature film, &quot;High Times&#x27; Potluck&quot;. Edison left &quot;High Times&quot; in 2001.

In 2000, the magazine established the Stony Awards to recognize and celebrate notable stoner films and television episodes about cannabis. Six &quot;High Times&quot; Stony Awards ceremonies were held in New York City beginning in 2000, before the Stonys moved to Los Angeles in 2007. Award winners received a bong-shaped trophy. Starting in 2002, the Stonys presented the Thomas King Forçade Award for &quot;stony achievement&quot; in film.

=== Later developments ===
In 2003, Steven Hager was fired, and &quot;High Times&quot;&#x27; board of directors shifted the magazine&#x27;s focus from marijuana to more literary content, hiring John Buffalo Mailer as executive editor. As a result, the magazine &quot;lost a third of the circulation in nine months.&quot; Mailer left the magazine within a year—a succession of editors followed, including David Bienenstock, Rick Cusick, and Steve Bloom. 

In 2004, &quot;High Times&quot; returned to its roots, releasing the CD &quot;High Volume: The Stoner Rock Collection&quot;. Hager was rehired, first as the creative director, and then in 2006, back to the position of editor-in-chief, but by 2009 he had returned to the role of creative director.

In November 2009, &quot;High Times&quot; celebrated its 35th anniversary.

In the period 2010–2013, the magazine put out a standalone publication that advocated for medical marijuana.

Hager was again let go by the magazine in 2013, eventually successfully suing &quot;High Times&quot; for defrauding him of his ownership shares in the company. Hager subsequently released a 20-part series on YouTube, titled &quot;The Strategic Meeting&quot;, showing the internal machinations inside the company. The video series asserts that Michael Kennedy stole the company from the rightful employees and subverted the original mission for his own private gain.

In October 2014, the magazine celebrated its 40th anniversary with a party attended by celebrities such as Susan Sarandon. In 2014, the &quot;High Times&quot; website was read by 500,000 to five million users each month.

=== Relocation to L.A., sale ===
In January 2017, the magazine announced it would be permanently relocating from New York to Los Angeles. This followed the legalization of marijuana in several West Coast states, including California. 

In the summer of 2017, &quot;High Times&quot; was sold to a group of investors led by Adam Levin of Oreva Capital for an amount estimated from $42 million to $70 million.

&quot;High Times&quot; acquired cannabis media company Green Rush Daily, Inc. on April 5, 2018. The deal was valued at $6.9 million. Green Rush Daily founder Scott McGovern joined the magazine as senior executive vice president.

Later, artists like Bob Fingerman and Mary Wilshire contributed comics to &quot;High Times&quot; as well.

== Notable contributors and staff members ==
Andrew Weil was a regular contributor to &quot;High Times&quot; from 1975 to 1983. For a time, William Levy served as the magazine&#x27;s European editor.

In 1976, Bruce Eisner became a contributing editor for the magazine. Chip Berlet was the magazine&#x27;s Washington, D.C. bureau chief in the Seventies. Jeff Goldberg was an editor in 1978–1979.

Kyle Kushman is a former cultivation reporter for &quot;High Times&quot; and has been a contributing writer for over 20 years.

Bobby Black had a long association with &quot;High Times&quot;, from 1994 to 2015, including being a senior editor and columnist. His involvement at &quot;High Times&quot; included production director and associate art director; writing the monthly lifestyle and entertainment column &quot;Almost Infamous&quot;; writing feature articles and interviews; creator and producer of the magazine&#x27;s annual Miss High Times beauty pageant; producer and host of the annual High Times Doobie Awards for music; lead reporter, judge, and competition coordinator for the Cannabis Cup and the High Times Medical Cannabis Cup; and A&amp;R, producer, liner notes and art director for &quot;High Volume: The Stoner Rock Collection&quot; CD (High Times Records).

At age 19, Zena Tsarfin started as an intern for the magazine. She later returned to &quot;High Times&quot;, serving as the magazine&#x27;s managing editor until 2001 and then again from March 2006 to January 2007. From 2014 to 2016, Tsarfin was &quot;High Times&quot;&#x27; director of digital media.

Danny Danko is the magazine&#x27;s former Senior Cultivation Editor.

The careers of a number of writers/editors from the comics industry overlapped with &quot;High Times&quot;, including Tsarfin, Josh Alan Friedman (&quot;High Times&quot; managing editor, 1983), Lou Stathis (&quot;High Times&quot; editor, late 1980s), Ann Nocenti (&quot;High Times&quot; editor, 2004), and most significantly, John Holmstrom, who began to work for the magazine as managing editor in 1987, was soon promoted to executive editor, and in 1991 was promoted to publisher and president. In 1996 he stepped aside to launch and oversee the &quot;High Times&quot; website, and left the magazine for good in 2000.

Andrew James Parker, a.k.a. Chewberto420, is a cannabis photographer and author, based out of the Western United States (predominantly Huntington Beach, California and Pagosa Springs, Colorado), who has made contributions to the magazine since 2016. Parker is known for his images based in macro photography. He discovered naturally occurring purple hash through experimentation with anthocyanins within cannabis.

<doc id="614418" wikidata="Q370316" url="?curid=614418" title="Robert Rubin">
<text>Robert Edward Rubin (born August 29, 1938) is an American retired banking executive, lawyer, and former government official. He served as the 70th U.S. Secretary of the Treasury during the Clinton administration. Before his government service, he spent 26 years at Goldman Sachs, eventually serving as a member of the board and co-chairman from 1990 to 1992.

Rubin is credited as a force behind Clinton-era economic prosperity, including the 1993 Deficit Reduction Act and Balanced Budget Act of 1997. However, critics of Rubin have since argued that the bank-friendly policies he supported contributed to the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

As of 2024, Rubin is active in several organizations, including as a co-founder of The Hamilton Project, as co-chair emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, and as a senior counselor at Centerview Partners.

==Early life and education==
Rubin was born on August 29, 1938, in New York City to Jewish parents Sylvia (née Seiderman) and Alexander Rubin. He moved to Miami Beach, Florida, at an early age and graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School. In 1960, Rubin graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, in economics from Harvard College. He then attended Harvard Law School for three days before leaving to travel the world. He later attended the London School of Economics and received an LL.B. from Yale Law School in 1964.

==Early career==
Rubin was an attorney at the firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton in New York City from 1964 to 1966 before joining Goldman Sachs in 1966 as an associate in the risk arbitrage department. He later served as co-chief operating officer, and became co-senior partner and co-chairman in 1990. 

Rubin served as New York finance chairman for the Walter Mondale presidential campaign in 1984 and headed the host committee for the 1992 Democratic National Convention in New York.

He served on the board of directors of the New York Stock Exchange, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Market Oversight and Financial Services Advisory Committee, and advisory panels for New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and Mayor David Dinkins.

== Clinton administration ==
From January 25, 1993, to January 10, 1995, Rubin served in the White House as Assistant to the President for Economic Policy. In that capacity, he directed the National Economic Council, which Bill Clinton created after winning the presidency. The National Economic Council, or NEC, enabled the White House to coordinate closely the workings of the Cabinet departments and agencies on policies ranging from budget and tax to international trade and alleviating poverty. The NEC coordinated policy recommendations going into the President&#x27;s office, and monitored implementation of the decisions that came out. Robert S. Strauss credited Rubin with making the system work. &quot;He&#x27;s surely the only man or woman in America that I know who could make the NEC succeed,&quot; Strauss said in 1994. &quot;Anyone else would have been a disruptive force, and the council wouldn&#x27;t have worked.&quot;

=== 1993 Deficit Reduction Act ===
Rubin encouraged Clinton to focus on deficit reduction and he was &quot;one of the chief architects&quot; of Clinton&#x27;s 1993 Deficit Reduction Act plan. 
Supporters said the Act helped create the late 1990s budget surplus and strong economic growth, while opponents noted it raised taxes. As officials deliberated the deficit reduction plan, Rubin advocated for tax increases on those in the upper-income tax bracket. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; said that the budget deal &quot;was critical&quot; and &quot;convinced nervous bond traders that the new Democratic president was serious about the deficit, lowering long-term interest rates, spurring economic growth and, ultimately, helping to balance the budget.&quot;

===Secretary of the Treasury===

Clinton nominated Rubin as Treasury secretary in December 1994. On January 10, 1995, Rubin was sworn in as the 70th United States Secretary of the Treasury after the U.S. Senate confirmed him in a 99-0 vote. Rubin&#x27;s tenure with the Clinton administration, especially as the head of Treasury, was marked by economic prosperity in the U.S. Rubin is credited as one of the main individuals behind U.S. economic growth, creating near full-employment and bullish stock markets while avoiding inflation. From the time he joined the White House until he announced his resignation from Treasury in 1999, U.S. unemployment fell from 6.9 percent to 4.3 percent; the U.S. budget went from a $255 billion deficit to a $70 billion surplus, and inflation fell. Rubin was succeeded in early July 1999 as Treasury secretary by his deputy, Lawrence Summers.

According to &quot;CNN Money&quot;, Rubin was &quot;one of the architects of the Clinton administration&#x27;s economic policy, and is often credited—along with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan—for the booming eight-year economic expansion, the second-longest in U.S. history&quot;.

Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) called Rubin &quot;an ideal public servant who put policy before politics.&quot; At the time of Rubin&#x27;s resignation, Clinton called Rubin the &quot;greatest secretary of the Treasury since Alexander Hamilton.&quot;

====1990s international crises====
Upon being sworn into office as Treasury secretary in January 1995, Rubin was confronted with the Mexican peso crisis, which threatened to result in Mexico defaulting on its foreign obligations. President Bill Clinton, with the advice of Rubin and Greenspan, provided $20 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to the Mexican government through the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Mexico recovered and the U.S. Treasury made a $580 million profit as a result of the loan agreement.

In 1997 and 1998, Rubin, Greenspan, and Deputy Treasury Secretary Summers worked with the International Monetary Fund and others to promote U.S. policy in response to financial crises in Russian, Asian, and Latin American financial markets. On the cover of its February 15, 1999, edition, &quot;Time Magazine&quot; dubbed the three policymakers &quot;The Committee to Save the World&quot;.

====Balanced budget agreement====

Early in the Clinton administration, Rubin touted a balanced budget and a strong dollar as a way for the Fed to lower interest rates. He also argued that a balanced federal budget&#x27;s broad benefits to society outweighed concerns that one group could benefit more than others. Rubin was the Clinton administration&#x27;s chief negotiator with a Republican-controlled Congress on the balanced-budget deal. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 has been referred to as the &quot;capstone&quot; of Rubin&#x27;s tenure as Treasury secretary.

==== Regulation of derivatives ====
In 1998, Rubin and Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan opposed giving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversight of over-the-counter credit derivatives when this was proposed by Brooksley Born, then head of the CFTC. Rubin and other senior officials recommended Congress relieve the CFTC of regulatory authority over derivatives in November 1999. Over-the-counter credit derivatives were eventually excluded from regulation by the CFTC by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. According to a &quot;Frontline&quot; report, derivatives played a key role in the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

Arthur Levitt Jr., a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has said in explaining Rubin&#x27;s strong opposition to the regulations proposed by Born that Greenspan and Rubin were &quot;joined at the hip on this. They were certainly very fiercely opposed to this and persuaded me that this would cause chaos.&quot; However, in Rubin&#x27;s autobiography, he notes that he believed derivatives could pose significant problems and that many people who used derivatives did not fully understand the risks they were taking. In 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the proposal in 1997 would not have improved oversight of derivatives. Rubin said the financial system &quot;could benefit from better regulation of derivatives&quot;. However, &quot;the politics would have made this impossible,&quot; he said. Rubin said he had been concerned about derivatives&#x27; potential to create systemic risk since his time at Goldman Sachs.

In an interview on &quot;ABC&quot;&#x27;s &quot;This Week&quot; program in April 2010, former President Clinton said Rubin was wrong in the advice he gave him not to regulate derivatives, which was by then seen as one of the underlying causes of the 2007–08 financial crisis. Clinton adviser Doug Band later said Clinton &quot;inadvertently conflated an analysis he received on a specific derivatives proposal with then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan&#x27;s arguments against any regulation of derivatives&quot;. He said Clinton still wished he had pursued legislation to regulate derivatives while confirming that he still believed he had received excellent advice on the economy and the financial system from Rubin and others during his presidency.

====Urban policy====
Rubin was a leading advocate for investment in distressed rural and urban communities in the Clinton administration, from his time with the NEC, leading the effort to expand the Community Reinvestment Act, to his time at Treasury, where he advocated for more community development financial institutions (CDFI) to invest in inner cities and increase the CDFI Fund. Addressing the needs of the urban poor was a top priority for Rubin during his tenure in the Clinton administration. Rubin also assisted with the Clinton administration&#x27;s plan to increase empowerment and enterprise zones across the U.S. The initiative offered tax breaks for businesses investing in those zones.

====Decline of the Glass-Steagall Act====
As Treasury Secretary, Robert Rubin was on the record for stating that the Glass-Steagall Act was obsolete and outdated, and indeed its provisions had become less effective over time. However, it was not until the late 1990s that the Congress and the Clinton administration finally came round to repealing the act. This resulted in part from lobbying pressure exercised by Sanford I. Weill on Congress and the White House to repeal the Act, and so allow the mega-merger he had organized between Travelers Group and Citicorp in 1998 to stand. Rubin resigned from the Clinton administration in July 1999. In October 1999, Rubin joined the leadership at Citigroup. Glass–Steagall was eventually repealed by the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act under Rubin&#x27;s successor, Lawrence Summers, and was signed by Clinton in November 1999.

== Post-government career ==
===Local Initiatives Support Corporation===
Upon leaving the Clinton administration, Rubin joined the board of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), the nation&#x27;s leading community development support organization, as chairman. Reflecting on his decision to join an institution devoted to bringing economic activity to neglected areas of the country, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said the following in an editorial: &quot;Even before he became Bill Clinton&#x27;s treasury secretary, during his days as a high-powered Wall Street executive, Rubin was passionate about fostering business investment as the way to fight poverty in depressed city and rural areas. That made him somewhat unusual among Democrats, who generally emphasized government anti-poverty programs.&quot;

===Citigroup===
Rubin joined Citigroup in 1999 as chairman of the executive committee of the board. In 2001, Enron, a major client of Citigroup, faced a credit ratings downgrade as a result of the Enron scandal. Rubin called a ranking Treasury Department official, unsuccessfully seeking the Bush Administration&#x27;s help in forestalling the downgrade. A subsequent staff investigation by the Senate Governmental Affairs committee cleared Rubin of having done anything illegal. Rubin later maintained that he had acted both as a Citigroup executive protecting his company&#x27;s position and as a former Treasury official concerned about the impact that Enron&#x27;s failure might have on the larger economy. Rubin rejected criticisms of a possible conflict of interest and has said that if faced with the same choice, he would do it again.

Rubin briefly became chairman of Citigroup&#x27;s board of directors from November 2007 to December 2007. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Rubin&#x27;s role at Citigroup focused on meeting with clients and government and business leaders, bringing in business, and serving as a sounding board to bank leadership. As the &quot;Times&quot; reported in 2007, Rubin &quot;has said publicly since he came to Citigroup in 1999 that he had no interest in running the bank&quot;. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported Rubin joined Citigroup as a board member and as a participant &quot;in strategic managerial and operational matters of the Company, but [...] no line responsibilities&quot;. The newspaper called this mix of oversight and management responsibilities &quot;murky&quot;.

Following the 2008 financial crisis, critics argued Rubin increased risk-taking at Citigroup, thereby exposing the bank to greater losses, and that economic policies he promoted as Treasury secretary exacerbated the situation. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Rubin has stated that &quot;he wasn&#x27;t alone in failing to foresee the severity of the crisis that would emerge&quot;. Other industry observers criticized the lack of clarity about Rubin&#x27;s role within the bank. The federal government spent $45 billion to acquire a stake in Citigroup in 2008 through the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Citigroup repaid $20 billion of the bailout money in December 2009 and the Treasury sold its remaining stake one year later, for a total net profit of $12 billion.

In December 2008, investors filed a lawsuit contending that Citigroup executives, including Rubin, sold shares at inflated prices while concealing the firm&#x27;s risks. Citigroup settled the lawsuit in 2012, paying $590 million to claimants and denying any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Rubin resigned from Citigroup in 2009. Between 1999 and 2009, Rubin received total compensation, including employee stock options, of $126 million from Citigroup. His compensation was criticized, with writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb noting that Rubin &quot;collected more than $120 million in compensation from Citibank in the decade preceding the banking crash of 2008. When the bank, literally insolvent, was rescued by the taxpayer, he didn&#x27;t write any check—he invoked uncertainty as an excuse.&quot; In 2010, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission interviewed Rubin as part of their investigation into the causes of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and concluded that Rubin &quot;may have violated the laws of the United States in relation to the financial crisis&quot; related to his role at Citigroup. The commission unanimously voted to refer him to the United States Department of Justice for further investigation; however, the DOJ did not pursue any further investigation or actions against Rubin.

===Other work===
On July 1, 2002, Rubin became a member of Harvard Corporation, the executive governing board of Harvard University. He served as a member of the Harvard Corporation board until June 2014, and as of 2018, served on its finance committee.

As of 2024, Rubin is involved in the Hamilton Project, an economic policy think tank he co-founded in 2006. He is co-chairman emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. He serves as a trustee of Mount Sinai Health System and as co-chair of the advisory board of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. Additionally, Rubin serves as a senior counselor at Centerview Partners, an investment banking advisory firm based in New York City.

Rubin was a member of the Africa Progress Panel (APP), a group of ten individuals who advocated for equitable and sustainable development in Africa by publishing seven annual reports between 2009 and 2015. Rubin also served on the Global Citizenship Commission, convened by former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, which reexamined and proposed an update to the United Nations&#x27; 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights.

=== Books ===
Rubin&#x27;s memoir, &quot;In an Uncertain World: Tough Choices from Wall Street to Washington&quot;, co-written by Jacob Weisberg, was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller as well as one of &quot;Business Week&quot;″s ten best business books of 2003.

Rubin&#x27;s second book, &quot;The Yellow Pad: Making Better Decisions in an Uncertain World&quot;, was published in May 2023. In it, he writes about his approach to &quot;probabilistic thinking&quot;, or understanding that every decision carries risk. The book was named one of the &quot;Best Books of 2023&quot; by &quot;Bloomberg News&quot;.

==Policy views==
===Economic policies===
Rubin has advocated for fiscal discipline and public investment, and worked to turn the federal budget deficit to a surplus while Treasury Secretary. He has advocated against high budget deficits and has been credited with developing the strong dollar policy that has been a cornerstone of U.S. economic policy since his tenure at Treasury.

He has been described as a centrist, pro-business, &quot;pro-growth Democrat&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and Associated Press have stated that Rubin&#x27;s policies as Treasury Secretary helped drive American economic growth in the 1990s. However, his policies have also been criticized by some Republicans for not cutting taxes enough, while some Democrats have said that Rubin&#x27;s policies contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. Rubin has supported progressive tax measures and expanding earned income tax credits to benefit low- and middle-income Americans. He has also opposed tax cuts that disproportionately benefit high earners, including those enacted during the administrations of George W. Bush and Donald Trump. During the Biden administration, Rubin joined with four former Treasury secretaries to support the Inflation Reduction Act and supported a permanent refundable child tax credit with former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew.

In April 2016, he was one of eight former Treasury secretaries who called on the United Kingdom to remain a member of the European Union ahead of the June 2016 Referendum.

===Climate change policies===
Among Rubin&#x27;s policy interests is climate change. In 2014, Rubin served as a member of the U.S. Climate Risk Committee, which oversaw the development of an analysis of the economic risks of climate change in the United States. In an address at the Climate Leadership Conference on March 4, 2015, Rubin spoke about the economic effects of climate change and the costs of inaction. Calling climate change &quot;the existential threat of our age,&quot; he called for the adoption of three proposals—revising estimates of the gross domestic product to reflect climate change externalities, disclosure to investors by companies of the costs of carbon they emit that they might be required to absorb, and including in the U.S. government&#x27;s fiscal projections the future costs of dealing with climate change—to help catalyze a more active response to climate change risks. He first outlined these proposals in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; op-ed column titled &quot;How Ignoring Climate Change Could Sink the U.S. Economy.&quot;

In 2016, former Treasury secretaries Rubin, Henry Paulson, and George Shultz, members of the climate research group the Risky Business Project, penned a letter to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, urging regulators to manage financial disclosures regarding climate change.

== Personal life ==
Rubin and his wife, Judith O. Rubin, have two grown sons together, James Rubin (not to be confused with James Phillip Rubin), and Philip Rubin. The Rubins were long time members of Temple Beth Sholom on Miami Beach.

<text>The Noguera Pallaresa (; , ) is a river in Catalonia, Spain.

It is named after the Pallars region.

==Course==
Its source is at &quot;Era Font d&#x27;era Noguereta&quot; in the municipality of Naut Aran (Aran Valley) at an elevation of about and barely from those of the Garonne. While the Garonne flows toward the Atlantic Ocean, the Noguera Pallaresa flows to the Segre, and enters that river from the right just before the reservoir of Camarasa (Noguera): its waters then flow to the Mediterranean. The Noguera Pallaresa is dammed at several points, including Talarn Dam, and the largest reservoirs are La Torassa (between Esterri d&#x27;Àneu and La Guingueta d&#x27;Àneu in the Pallars Sobirà), Sant Antoni (above Talarn in the Pallars Jussà), Terradets (in the municipality of Àger in the Noguera) and Camarasa (just above the confluence with the Segre).

==Wildwater sports==
Between the dam in the reservoir Panta de la Torrassa and the lake Panta de Sant Antoni the river is a favourite course for wildwater canoeing and rafting. During spring and summer the river falls dry at night, but in the morning the weir is opened and in several hours makes it a rather voluminous river with wild water class 2, 3 and 4 rapids. In the evening the weir is closed again.
