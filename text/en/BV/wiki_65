<text>A mating system is a way in which a group is structured in relation to sexual behaviour. The precise meaning depends upon the context. With respect to animals, the term describes which males and females mate under which circumstances. Recognised systems include monogamy, polygamy (which includes polygyny, polyandry, and polygynandry), and promiscuity, all of which lead to different mate choice outcomes and thus these systems affect how sexual selection works in the species which practice them. In plants, the term refers to the degree and circumstances of outcrossing. In human sociobiology, the terms have been extended to encompass the formation of relationships such as marriage.

==In plants==

The primary mating systems in plants are outcrossing (cross-fertilisation), autogamy (self-fertilisation) and apomixis (asexual reproduction without fertilization, but only when arising by modification of sexual function). Mixed mating systems, in which plants use two or even all three mating systems, are not uncommon.

A number of models have been used to describe the parameters of plant mating systems. The basic model is the mixed mating model, which is based on the assumption that every fertilisation is either self-fertilisation or completely random cross-fertilisation. More complex models relax this assumption; for example, the effective selfing model recognises that mating may be more common between pairs of closely related plants than between pairs of distantly related plants.

==In animals==

The following are some of the mating systems generally recognized in animals:
*Monogamy: One male and one female have an exclusive mating relationship. The term &quot;pair bonding&quot; often implies this. This is associated with one-male, one-female group compositions. There are two types of monogamy: type 1, which is facultative, and type 2, which is obligate. Facultative monogamy occurs when there are very low densities in a species. This means that mating occurs with only a single member of the opposite sex because males and females are very far apart. When a female needs aid from conspecifics in order to have a litter this is obligate monogamy. However, with this, the habitat carrying capacity is small so it means only one female can breed within the habitat.
*Polygamy: Three types are recognized:
**Polygyny (the most common polygamous mating system in vertebrates so far studied): One male has an exclusive relationship with two or more females. This is associated with one-male, multi-female group compositions. Many perennial &quot;Vespula squamosa &quot; (southern yellowjacket) colonies are polygynous. Different types of polygyny exist, such as lek polygyny and resource defense polygyny. Grayling butterflies (&quot;Hipparchia semele&quot;) engage in resource defense polygyny, where females choose a territorial male based on the best oviposition site. Although most animals opt for only one of these strategies, some exhibit hybrid strategies, such as the bee species, &quot;Xylocopa micans&quot;. 
**Polyandry: One female has an exclusive relationship with two or more males. This is very rare and is associated with multi-male, multi-female group compositions. Genetic polyandry is found some insect species such as &quot;Apis mellifera&quot; (the Western Honey Bee), in which a virgin queen will mate with multiple drones during her nuptial flight whereas each drone will die immediately upon mating once. The queen will then store the sperm collected from these multiple matings in her spermatheca to use to fertilize eggs throughout the course of her entire reproductive life.
**Polygynandry: Polygynandry is a slight variation of this, where two or more males have an exclusive relationship with two or more females; the numbers of males and females do not have to be equal, and in vertebrate species studied so far, the number of males is usually less. This is associated with multi-male, multi-female group compositions.
*Promiscuity: A member of one sex within the social group mates with any member of the opposite sex. This is associated with multi-male, multi-female group compositions.

These mating relationships may or may not be associated with social relationships, in which the sexual partners stay together to become parenting partners. As the alternative term &quot;pair bonding&quot; implies, this is usual in monogamy. In many polyandrous systems, the males and the female stay together to rear the young. In polygynous systems where the number of females paired with each male is low and the male will often stay with one female to help rear the young, while the other females rear their young on their own. In polygynandry, each of the males may assist one female; if all adults help rear all the young, the system is more usually called &quot;communal breeding&quot;. In highly polygynous systems, and in promiscuous systems, paternal care of young is rare, or there may be no parental care at all.

These descriptions are idealized, and the social partnerships are often easier to observe than the mating relationships. In particular:
*the relationships are rarely exclusive for all individuals in a species. DNA fingerprinting studies have shown that even in pair-bonding, matings outside the pair (extra-pair copulations) occur with fair frequency, and a significant minority of offspring result from them. However, the offspring that are a result of extra-pair copulations usually exhibit more advantageous genes. These genes can be associated with improvements in appearance, mating, and the functioning of internal body systems.
*some species show different mating systems in different circumstances, for example in different parts of their geographical range, or under different conditions of food availability
*mixtures of the simple systems described above may occur.

Sexual conflict occurs between individuals of different sexes that have separate or conflicting requirements for optimal mating success. This conflict may lead to competitive adaptations and co-adaptations of one or both of the sexes to maintain mating processes that are beneficial to that sex. Intralocus sexual conflict and interlocus sexual conflict describe the genetic influence behind sexual conflict, and are presently recognized as the most basic forms of sexual conflict.

===In humans===

Compared to other vertebrates, where a species usually has a single mating system, humans display great variety. Humans also differ by having formal marriages which in some cultures involve negotiation and arrangement between elder relatives. Regarding sexual dimorphism (see the section about animals above), humans are in the intermediate group with moderate sex differences in body size but with relatively small testes, indicating relatively low sperm competition in socially monogamous and polygynous human societies. One estimate is that 83% of human societies are polygynous, 0.05% are polyandrous, and the rest are monogamous. Even the last group may at least in part be genetically polygynous.

From an evolutionary standpoint, females are more prone to practice monogamy because their reproductive success is based on the resources they are able to acquire through reproduction rather than the quantity of offspring they produce. However, males are more likely to practice polygamy because their reproductive success is based on the amount of offspring they produce, rather than any kind of benefit from parental investment.

Polygyny is associated with an increased sharing of subsistence provided by women. This is consistent with the theory that if women raise the children alone, men can concentrate on the mating effort. Polygyny is also associated with greater environmental variability in the form of variability of rainfall. This may increase the differences in the resources available to men. An important association is that polygyny is associated with a higher pathogen load in an area which may make having good genes in a male increasingly important. A high pathogen load also decreases the relative importance of sororal polygyny which may be because it becomes increasingly important to have genetic variability in the offspring (See Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection).

Virtually all the terms used to describe animal mating systems were adopted from social anthropology, where they had been devised to describe systems of marriage. This shows that human sexual behavior is unusually flexible since, in most animal species, one mating system dominates. While there are close analogies between animal mating systems and human marriage institutions, these analogies should not be pressed too far, because in human societies, marriages typically have to be recognized by the entire social group in some way, and there is no equivalent process in animal societies. The temptation to draw conclusions about what is &quot;natural&quot; for human sexual behavior from observations of animal mating systems should be resisted: a socio-biologist observing the kinds of behavior shown by humans in any other species would conclude that all known mating systems were natural for that species, depending on the circumstances or on individual differences.

As culture increasingly affects human mating choices, ascertaining what is the &#x27;natural&#x27; mating system of the human animal from a zoological perspective becomes increasingly difficult. Some clues can be taken from human anatomy, which is essentially unchanged from the prehistoric past:

*humans have a small relative size of testes to body mass in comparison to most primates;
*humans have a small ejaculate volume and sperm count in comparison to other primates;
*as compared to most primates, humans spend more time in copulation;
*as compared to most primates, humans copulate with lower frequency;
*the outward signs of estrus in women (i.e. higher body temperature, breast swelling, sugar cravings, etc.), are often perceived to be less obvious in comparison to the outward signs of ovulation in most other mammals;
*for most mammals, the estrous cycle and its outward signs bring on mating activity; the majority of female-initiated matings in humans coincides with estrus, but humans copulate throughout the reproductive cycle;
*after ejaculation/orgasm in males and females, humans release a hormone that has a sedative effect;

Some have suggested that these anatomical factors signify some degree of sperm competition, although others have provided anatomical evidence to suggest that sperm competition risk in humans is low;
*humans have a small ejaculate volume and sperm count in comparison to other primates, even though levels of genetic and societal promiscuity are highly varied across cultures,

===Genetic causes and effects===
Monogamy has evolved multiple times in animals, with homologous brain structures predicting the mating and parental strategies used by them. These homologous structures were brought about by similar mechanisms. Even though there have been many different evolutionary pathways to get to monogamy, all the studied organisms express their genes very similarly in the fore and midbrain, implying a universal mechanism for the evolution of monogamy in vertebrates. While genetics is not the exclusive cause of mating systems within animals, it is influential in many animals, particularly rodents, which have been the most heavily researched. Certain rodents’ mating systems—monogamous, polygynous, or socially monogamous with frequent promiscuity—are correlated with suggested evolutionary phylogenies, where rodents more closely related genetically are more likely to use a similar mating system, suggesting an evolutionary basis. These differences in mating strategy can be traced back to a few significant alleles that affect behaviors that are heavily influential on mating system, such as the alleles responsible for the level of parental care, how animals choose their partner(s), and sexual competitiveness, among others, which are all at least partially influenced by genetics. While these genes may not perfectly correlate with the mating system that animals use, genetics is one factor that may lead to a species or population reproducing using one mating system over another, or even potentially multiple at different locations or points in time.

Mating systems can also have large impacts on the genetics of a population, strongly affecting natural selection and speciation. In plover populations, polygamous species tend to speciate more slowly than monogamous species do. This is likely because polygamous animals tend to move larger distances to find mates, contributing to a high level of gene flow, which can genetically homogenize many nearby subpopulations. Monogamous animals, on the other hand, tend to stay closer to their starting location, not dispersing as much. Because monogamous animals don’t migrate as far, monogamous populations which are geographically closer together tend to reproductively isolate from each other more easily, and thus each subpopulation is more likely to diversify or speciate from the other nearby populations as compared to polygamous populations. In polygamous species, however, the male partner in polygynous species and female partner in polyandrous species often tend to spread further to look for mates, potentially to find more or better mates. The increased level of movement among populations leads to increased gene flow between populations, effectively making geographically distinct populations into genetically similar ones via interbreeding. This has been observed in some species of rodents, where generally promiscuous species were quickly differentiated into monogamous and polygamous taxa by a prominent introduction of monogamous behaviors in some populations of that species, showing the swift evolutionary effects different mating systems can have. Specifically, monogamous populations speciated up to 4.8 times faster and had lower extinction rates than non monogamous populations. Another way that monogamy has the potential to cause increased speciation is because individuals are more selective with partners and competition, causing different nearby populations of the same species to stop interbreeding as much, leading to speciation down the road.

Another potential effect of polyandry in particular is increasing the quality of offspring and reducing the probability of reproductive failure. There are many possible reasons for this, one of the possibilities being that there is greater genetic variation in families because most offspring in a family will have either a different mother or father. This reduces the potential harm done by inbreeding, as siblings will be less closely related and more genetically diverse. Additionally, because of the increased genetic diversity among generations, the levels of reproductive fitness are also more variable, and so it is easier to select for positive traits more quickly, as the difference in fitness between members of the same generation would be greater. When many males are actively mating, polyandry can decrease the risk of extinction as well, as it can increase the effective population size. Increased effective population sizes are more stable and less prone to accumulating deleterious mutations due to genetic drift.

==In microorganisms==

===Bacteria===

Mating in bacteria involves transfer of DNA from one cell to another and incorporation of the transferred DNA into the recipient bacteria&#x27;s genome by homologous recombination. Transfer of DNA between bacterial cells can occur in three main ways. First, a bacterium can take up exogenous DNA released into the intervening medium from another bacterium by a process called transformation. DNA can also be transferred from one bacterium to another by the process of transduction, which is mediated by an infecting virus (bacteriophage). The third method of DNA transfer is &quot;conjugation&quot;, in which a plasmid mediates transfer through direct cell contact between cells.

Transformation, unlike transduction or conjugation, depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process, and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer. In order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed natural competence. In &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; about 40 genes are required for the development of competence and DNA uptake. The length of DNA transferred during &quot;B. subtilis&quot; transformation can be as much as a third and up to the whole chromosome. Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species, and at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation. The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells.

===Archaea===

In several species of archaea, mating is mediated by formation of cellular aggregates.
&quot;Halobacterium volcanii&quot;, an extreme halophilic archaeon, forms cytoplasmic bridges between cells that appear to be used for transfer of DNA from one cell to another in either direction.

When the hyperthermophilic archaea &quot;Sulfolobus solfataricus&quot; and &quot;Sulfolobus acidocaldarius&quot; are exposed to the DNA damaging agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. Aggregation in &quot;S. solfataricus&quot; could not be induced by other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift, suggesting that aggregation is induced specifically by DNA damage. Ajon et al. showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in &quot;S. acidocaldarius&quot;. Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species-specific DNA transfer between &quot;Sulfolobus&quot; cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination. This response appears to be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are also associated with species specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.

===Protists===

Protists are a large group of diverse eukaryotic microorganisms, mainly unicellular animals and plants, that do not form tissues. Eukaryotes emerged in evolution more than 1.5 billion years ago. The earliest eukaryotes were likely protists. Mating and sexual reproduction are widespread among extant eukaryotes. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, Dacks and Roger proposed that facultative sex was present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes.

However, to many biologists it seemed unlikely until recently, that mating and sex could be a primordial and fundamental characteristic of eukaryotes. A principal reason for this view was that mating and sex appeared to be lacking in certain pathogenic protists whose ancestors branched off early from the eukaryotic family tree. However, several of these protists are now known to be capable of, or to recently have had, the capability for meiosis and hence mating. To cite one example, the common intestinal parasite &quot;Giardia intestinalis&quot; was once considered to be a descendant of a protist lineage that predated the emergence of meiosis and sex. However, &quot;G. intestinalis&quot; was recently found to have a core set of genes that function in meiosis and that are widely present among sexual eukaryotes. These results suggested that &quot;G. intestinalis&quot; is capable of meiosis and thus mating and sexual reproduction. Furthermore, direct evidence for meiotic recombination, indicative of mating and sexual reproduction, was also found in &quot;G. intestinalis&quot;. Other protists for which evidence of mating and sexual reproduction has recently been described are parasitic protozoa of the genus &quot;Leishmania&quot;, &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;, and acanthamoeba.

Protists generally reproduce asexually under favorable environmental conditions, but tend to reproduce sexually under stressful conditions, such as starvation or heat shock.

===Viruses===

Both animal viruses and bacterial viruses (bacteriophage) are able to undergo mating. When a cell is mixedly infected by two genetically marked viruses, recombinant virus progeny are often observed indicating that mating interaction had occurred at the DNA level. Another manifestation of mating between viral genomes is multiplicity reactivation (MR). MR is the process by which at least two virus genomes, each containing inactivating genome damage, interact with each other in an infected cell to form viable progeny viruses. The genes required for MR in bacteriophage T4 are largely the same as the genes required for allelic recombination. Examples of MR in animal viruses are described in the articles &quot;Herpes simplex virus&quot;, &quot;Influenza A virus&quot;, &quot;Adenoviridae&quot;, &quot;Simian virus 40&quot;, &quot;Vaccinia virus&quot;, and &quot;Reoviridae&quot;.

<doc id="624314" wikidata="Q2038577" url="?curid=624314" title="Drums Along the Mohawk">
<text>Drums Along the Mohawk is a 1939 American historical drama film based upon a 1936 novel of the same name by American author Walter D. Edmonds. The film stars Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert, was produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, and directed by John Ford.

Fonda and Colbert portray a couple who settle on the New York frontier during the American Revolutionary War and defends their farm from Loyalist and Native American attacks before the conflict ends and peace is restored.

Edmonds based the novel on a number of historic figures who lived in the valley. The film—Ford&#x27;s first Technicolor feature—was well received. It became a major box-office success and was nominated for one Academy Award.

==Plot==

Lana Borst, the eldest daughter of a wealthy colonial family, marries Gilbert Martin. Together, they leave her family&#x27;s luxurious home to embark on a frontier life on Gil&#x27;s small Deerfield farm situated in the Mohawk Valley of Central New York. In July 1776, after the American Revolutionary War has broken out, the valley&#x27;s settlers have formed a militia in anticipation of conflict, and Gil enlists in it.

As Gil and his neighbors are clearing land for farming, Blue Back, a friendly Oneida man, arrives to warn them that a Seneca raiding party led by a Loyalist named Caldwell is in the valley. The settlers leave their farms and take refuge in nearby Fort Schuyler. Lana, who is pregnant, miscarries during the frantic ride to the fort. Martin&#x27;s farm is destroyed by the raiding party. With no home and winter approaching, the Martins accept work on the farm of a wealthy widow, Mrs. McKlennar.

During a peaceful interlude, Mrs. McKlennar and the Martins prosper. Then, word comes that a large force of Loyalist troops and Native Americans are approaching the valley. The militia sets out westward to intercept the attackers, but their approach is badly timed and they are ambushed. Though the enemy force is eventually defeated at Oriskany, more than half of the militiamen are killed. Gil returns home, wounded and delirious, but slowly recovers. Lana is again pregnant and delivers a son.

Later, the Loyalists and Native Americans mount a major attack to take the valley, and the settlers again take refuge in the fort. Mrs. McKlennar is mortally wounded and ammunition runs short. Gil makes a heroic dash through enemy lines to secure help from nearby Fort Dayton. Reinforcements arrive just in time to beat back the attackers, who are about to overwhelm the fort. The militia pursues, harasses, and defeats the enemy, scattering them into the wilderness. The Mohawk Valley settlement is saved. Shortly afterward, a regiment arrives at the fort to announce that Lord Cornwallis has surrendered to George Washington at the siege of Yorktown and the war is over. The settlers look forward to their future in the new, independent United States.

==Production==
Parts of the film were shot in Utah, specifically in Duck Creek, Strawberry Valley, Mirror Lake, Navajo Lake, Sidney Valley, and Cedar Breaks National Monument.

==Historical accuracy==
&quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; is loosely based on historical events. A central feature of the plot is the Battle of Oriskany, a pivotal engagement of the Saratoga campaign during the American Revolutionary War, in which a British force drove southward from Canada in an attempt to occupy the Hudson Valley and isolate Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts from the rest of the Thirteen Colonies. A second, smaller force called the St. Leger Expedition, traveled down the St Lawrence, across Lake Ontario, and marched across the Mohawk Valley heading from the west, and besieged Fort Schuyler, now better known under its original, prewar name of Fort Stanwix.

The Mohawk Valley of upstate New York had been the traditional homeland of the Iroquois Six Nations, a powerful political and military force in the region prior to the American Revolution. Increasingly, white settlers entered the area, with a contingent furthest west of primarily German Palatine origin, who had been largely welcomed by the Mohawks resident there.

Nonetheless, the larger Iroquois Confederacy (that the Mohawks were a part of) was quite concerned about the increasing presence and growing numbers of White settlers in their homeland. Dependent on the White civilization for trade goods and economic opportunities, it was at first eager to try to stay neutral in the conflict between Americans settlers and the British Crown; this proved impossible for several reasons, and the bulk of the Iroquois nations chose sides in the conflict. The Seneca and the Mohawk, led by Joseph Brant, sided with the British, motivated by their traditional good relations with Britain and SIr William Johnson, and Britain&#x27;s promise to continue to work to reduce American settlement in their homeland. Others, notably the Oneida, sided with the Americans and participated in this conflict on the rebel side throughout the war.

Prior to the arrival of the St. Leger Expedition, the conflict in the region was primarily between local people who wished to remain loyal to the Crown and those who wished to separate from British rule. Locally recruited Loyalist units also participated in the fighting in the region. Troops from the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York, (also known as Johnson&#x27;s Royal Greens) and Butler&#x27;s Rangers, participated in the campaign and fought at the Battle of Oriskany on the side of the Crown with Mohawk and Seneca warriors.

Contrary to its depiction in the film, Fort Schuyler was situated far from any civilian settlements at the site of an important portage of east-west travel through the Mohawk Valley. The fort was besieged by British, Loyalist and Hessian soldiers aided by Seneca and Mohawk warriors, and was defended by Continental Army soldiers from the 3rd New York Regiment and troops from Massachusetts, not militiamen. The Tryon County militia, under General Nicholas Herkimer, aided by Oneida Iroquois, attempted to assist in the fort&#x27;s defense, but they were ambushed on their way there by a predominantly Mohawk, Seneca, and loyalist force at Oriskany, six miles east of the fort.

Some sources state that attacks on settlements in the Mohawk Valley lacked a historical basis, and were included in the film because Ford felt obliged to perpetuate the mythology. Others contend that countless raids were conducted throughout the war, often by hostile Native Americans allied with loyalists from New York, such as Butler&#x27;s Rangers and the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York. Among these were the Cherry Valley Massacre, the Battle of Cobleskill, the raid on the Ballston Lake, and others. Such attacks were one motivation for the later Sullivan Expedition and the Battle of Newtown, as Contintental forces tried to end this threat. Many of the Loyalists who had been forced to flee to Canada from the valley due to the war believed that attacks on their former neighbors in New York might result in the Mohawk Valley remaining Crown territory as part of Canada. This aspect of the war has been covered by, among others, the writings of Gavin K. Watt, a Canadian historian of Loyalist descent.

The film includes only Loyalists and Native Americans as antagonists; the British are seldom referenced or seen. While Loyalists and local Native American tribes were a factor in the actual Mohawk Valley campaign, their role was a minor one compared to that of the British Army. Ford chose to minimize the British role in the film due to the global political situation in 1939: &quot;He knew that war with Germany was coming, and he had little desire to show the British as villains when they were fighting for their lives against the Nazis.&quot;

Correctly portrayed in the film is that the American forces of the Revolutionary War were ethnically and linguistically diverse. The settlers in the Mohawk Valley included many German-speaking Palatines, including Nicholas Herkimer, and many Dutch, including the commander of Fort Schuyler, Peter Gansevoort of the 3rd New York Regiment.

==Location Premiere==
A popular trend in Hollywood at the time was location premieres, wherein communities could apply to be given world-premiere status based on geographic location in films. 40 municipalities applied and 5 were awarded, given their geographic location within the Mohawk Valley. The first one was awarded to Gloversville, New York, where it screened at the Glove Theatre, the flagship venue and headquarters for Schine Enterprise, citing its geographic location of Fort Johnson and Sacandaga. Other locations included Albany, New York, at Palace Theatre (Albany, New York) wherein NYS Governor Herbert H. Lehman and Mayor John Boyd Thacher II were in attendance with descendants of Colonial Albany; Utica, New York, at the Olympic Theatre; and Amsterdam, New York, at the Rialto Theatre, also operated by Schine Enterprise. Prior to the screening, a street parade took place which included several Native American Tribes, The Liberty Boys, and descendants of Douw Fonda.

==Reception==
Frank S. Nugent reviewed the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot; of November 4, 1939, and praised the film for its faithfulness to the book and well-balanced acting.

==Awards==
The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress (Edna May Oliver).
It was on a preliminary list of submissions from the studios for an Academy Award for Cinematography (Color) but was not nominated.

==Restoration==
&quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; was restored by the Academy Film Archive, in conjunction with The Film Foundation, in 2007.

<doc id="624322" wikidata="Q6399985" url="?curid=624322" title="Khammam Fort">
<text>Khammam Fort is a fort in the city of Khammam, Telangana, India constructed by Musunuri Nayaks. It served as an impregnable citadel during various regimes of different dynasties, including the Musunuri Nayaks, Qutb Shahi’s and Asaf Jahis. The fort was situated in a very vast area in the heart of the City of Khammam. It was notified as a protected monument by the Archaeology Department several decades ago. Despite decades of neglect, the historical edifice, which once flourished with regal opulence, presents its alluring charm due to its architectural splendor.

==Etymology==
The historical records show that the earlier name was &quot;Kambham mettu&quot; or &quot;Stambhadri&quot;. &quot;Mettu&quot; means hill or highland in the Telugu language. The name was also anglicised as &quot;Commomet&quot; and &quot;Khammammet&quot;.khammam fort is also called as killa 

== Construction ==
The Khammam Fort was built by Musunuri Nayaks. Several inscriptions were discovered in the surrounding areas of Khammam and Krishna districts of Musunuri Nayaks. Khammam slowly became an independent territory within the kingdom of Kakatiyas for Musunuri Nayaks. 75 Telugu speaking feudatories of the region under the leadership of Musunuri Nayaks fought for 10 long years to unify the Telugu land and succeeded in repulsing the Delhi Sultanate forces under Malik Maqbul (Khan-e-Jahan Tilangani) out of their country.

==Architecture &amp; Significant Features==
* This Fort is located in an area of 4 Sq. miles in the heart of the City of Khammam on top of a massive granite Hill. It is surrounded by a huge rock wall averaging between 40 and 80 feet(13 to 25 Meters) in height and 15 to 20 feet(4.5 to 6 Meters) in width. There are steps from each buruju (bastion) to enter into the fort. The Fort was considered practically impregnable by invading armies.
* A number of balconies and windows are constructed along the wall in order to use the artillery during wartime. It has a capacity of mounting at least 60 cannons at a time.
* The fort 10 large gates most of them in poor shape now. Each gate has cannons mounted on them along with a water pot made of rocks. They are built such that an impact of a cannonball could not break it.
* The main entrance is a 30-foot tall entrance known as the Khilla darwaza (meaning fort gate in Urdu). It has 2 cannons on either side of the entrance. One of them still mounted with a head. They are now partially destroyed due to the negligence of the archeology department.
* The east gate or the secondary entrance is equally large and is popularly known as the Raathi Darwaza (meaning stone entrance in Urdu) or Potha Darwaza.
* All other gates are smaller than the main entrance and could have been constructed to avoid large cavalries to enter the fort in case of an attack.
* A huge rainwater catchment system and well have been constructed on the Khilla during the period of Zafar-ud-doula, well known for construction of tanks during Qutb shahi dynasty. This massive tank is now known as the &#x27;Zafar well&#x27;. It is 60 feet X 30 feet stepped well with a bridge across it for men and horses to move around. He also built the walls using Bricks and limestone along the fort.
* As soon as we enter the Khilla darwaza, one can see the Fort at a distance of 300 feet. There are small steps carved out of this hill to reach the top of the Hill fort. They are later renovated with railings for the steps by the Tourism department and Archaeological Survey of India in 2005 during the 1000 year celebrations of this historical fort. A lot of small gates known as &#x27;Dalohiswar&#x27; are all around the walls of the fort.
* Fort has at least 15 bastions constructed with two massive walls as a military strategy to take the impact of the cannonballs and to counter the enemy from the top. A 15-foot deep trench is dug in some places for the army to store and use as a hiding place.
* The huge blocks of stone used for the walls are as long as 10 feet and are believed to be transported using elephants and men. No mud or limestone is used in this huge wall and the rocks are tightly placed and leaving the viewers amazed by the construction
* A permanent Gallows has been erected on this prominent hill fort, where the estimated seat of justice could have been inside the fort. The platform is made of Stone and appears like a well, due to which the locals call this &#x27;Nethi bhavi&#x27; (&#x27;నేతి బావి &#x27;meaning Ghee well). This stone structure could be seen from allover the city of khammam.
* The fort is believed to have a secret tunnels to the Warangal Fort with multiple entrances in different locations at the fort. One such entrance is 10 feet in diameter and the steps to enter the tunnel are closed due to damage over the years. The local folklore includes stories about valuables being transferred between the kings from here using the secret passages and escaping enemy attacks through them.

== Culture ==
This fort appears to be a replicate the cultures of both Hindu and Muslim rulers who ruled this fort city.

The Lakshmi Narasimha swami temple in Brahmin bazar, Sri Ramalingeshwara temple is one of the oldest shivalayam (Shiva temple) are some of the oldest Hindu temples in Telangana and are older than the fort itself.

During the Qutb shahi dynasty, many new places of worship have been constructed in and around the fort such as the Khilla masjid.

== Encroachments ==
The fort, once mighty bastion of royal dynasties, continues to face further encroachment threat due to lack of proper monitoring mechanism. Large settlements occupied the areas in and around the fort due to the lack of proper monitoring of encroachments. Destruction of the granite hill and construction of houses continues till today around the fort area.
== Development ==
Recently Minister for Roads &amp; Buildings Tummala Nageswara Rao has mooted the proposal to set up solar streetlights at the fort well before the next Independence Day celebrations in 2017.

<doc id="624323" wikidata="Q653415" url="?curid=624323" title="Malay trade and creole languages">
<text>In addition to its classical and modern literary form, Malay had various regional dialects established after the rise of the Srivijaya empire in Sumatra, Indonesia. Also, Malay spread through interethnic contact and trade across the south East Asia Archipelago as far as the Philippines. That contact resulted in a lingua franca (&quot;trade language&quot;) that was called &quot;Bazaar Malay&quot; or &quot;low Malay&quot; and in Malay &quot;Melayu Pasar&quot;. It is generally believed that Bazaar Malay was a pidgin, influenced by contact among Malay, Hokkien, Portuguese, and Dutch traders.

Besides the general simplification that occurs with pidgins, the Malay lingua franca had several distinctive characteristics. One was that possessives were formed with &quot;punya&quot; &#x27;its owner, to have&#x27;; another was that plural pronouns were formed with &quot;orang&quot; &#x27;person&#x27;. The only Malayic affixes that remained productive were &quot;tər-&quot; and &quot;bər-&quot;.

Other common features:
*&quot;Ada&quot; became a progressive particle.
*Reduced forms of &quot;ini&quot; &#x27;this&#x27; and &quot;itu&quot; &#x27;that&#x27; (&gt;&quot;ni&quot;, &quot;tu&quot;) before a noun.
*The verb &quot;pərgi&quot; &#x27;go&#x27; was reduced, and became a preposition &#x27;towards&#x27;.
*Causative constructions were formed with &quot;kasi&quot; or &quot;bəri&quot; &#x27;to give&#x27; or &quot;bikin&quot; or &quot;buat&quot; &#x27;to make&#x27;.
*A single preposition, often &quot;sama&quot;, was used for multiple functions, including direct and indirect object.

For example,
* &quot;Rumahku&quot; &#x27;my house&#x27; becomes &quot;Aku punya rumah&quot; (lit. &#x27;I have (that) house&#x27;)
* &quot;Aku pukul dia&quot; &#x27;I hit him&#x27; becomes &quot;Aku kasi pukul dia&quot; (lit. &#x27;I give a hit to him&#x27;)
* &quot;Ardi dipukul oleh Dani&quot; &#x27;Ardi is hit by Dani&#x27; becomes &quot;Ardi kena pukul dek Dani&quot;

==Peranakan-Baba Malay==
=== Baba Malay ===
Baba Malay is spoken by the Peranakans in Melaka (in Malaysia) and Singapore. A typical contact language between Hokkien male settlers and local Malay women, it has &quot;more Hokkien grammar and more Malay lexicon&quot;. As of 2014, there are 1,000 speakers in Malaysia and another 1,000 in Singapore. It is mostly spoken among the older populations. In 1986, Pakir estimated there were 5,000 speakers in Singapore. A Baba Indonesian variant is also spoken in East Java.

Example (spoken in Melaka-Singapore):
* : He likes to come here and gossip.
* &quot;Keliap-keliap, dia naik angin.&quot;: Slightly provoked, he gets angry.
* &quot;Gua tunggu dia sampai gua k&#x27;ee geram.&quot;: I waited for him until I got angry.
* &quot;Oo-wa! Kinajeet, dia pasang kuat.&quot;: Wow! Today he dresses stylishly!

===Baba Indonesian===

A kind of Baba Malay, locally called &quot;Peranakan&quot; from the ethnonym, is spoken among Chinese-Indonesians living in various regions of Indonesia, most visibly in Surabaya and Medan. It is a mixture of three languages: Indonesian (national language), a local language and Chinese elements (ancestry/ethnic language, particularly for certain jargon or glossary such as family relations, business and commerce, and culinary fields). The most famous variety is found in East Java, especially in Surabaya and surrounding areas, called &quot;Basa Suroboyoan&quot; (Surabayan language), with a strong emphasis of low Javanese (&quot;ngoko&quot; Javanese) and informal tone, which is not only spoken by Chinese-Indonesian in Surabaya, but also by non-Chinese-Indonesians when conversing with the former.

Example (spoken in Surabaya):
* : Don&#x27;t act that way!
* &quot;Yak apa kabarnya si Eli?&quot;: How&#x27;s Eli?
* &quot;Ntik kamu pigio ambek cecemu ae ya.&quot;: Go with your sister, okay?
* &quot;Nih, makanen sakadae.&quot;: Please have a meal!
* &quot;Kamu cariken bukune koko ndhek rumahe Ling Ling.&quot;: Search your brother&#x27;s book in Ling Ling&#x27;s house.

Apart from East Javan Chinese-Indonesian, other Chinese-Indonesians tend to speak the language varieties of the places in which they live, such as the Central Javan Chinese-Indonesian can speak with formal/high Javanese (&quot;krama&quot; Javanese) when necessary, while in daily conversation they will use Indonesia-Javanese-Chinese pidgin. West Javan Chinese-Indonesians tend to mix Sundanese in their vocabulary, and Medan (North Sumatran) Chinese-Indonesian have more Hokkien words mixed in.

==Betawi Malay==

==Thousand Islands Malay==
==Malaccan Creole Malay==
==Sri Lanka Malay==
== Singapore Bazaar Malay ==
Singapore Bazaar Malay, also known as Bazaar Malay, Pasar Malay, or Market Malay, is a Malay-lexified pidgin, which is spoken in Singapore. Tamil and Hokkien contributed to the development of Bazaar Malay, with Hokkien being the dominant substrate language of Bazaar Malay, with Malay being the lexifier language. However, there are many input languages spoken by immigrants that also contributed to the development of Bazaar Malay, including languages spoken by Malays, Chinese, Indians, Eurasians, and Europeans. Singapore Bazaar Malay emerged along with the opening of Singapore&#x27;s free trade port in 1819, to overcome barriers in communication and business transactions. Since Singapore has only four official languages (English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil), Singapore Bazaar Malay not only is a lingua franca in interethnic communication, it is also used in intra-group communication. Singapore Bazaar Malay is mostly spoken by elders and middle-aged workers today, but its language status is declining due to education policies and language campaigns with less than 10,000 speakers.

Bazaar Malay is used in a limited extent in Singapore and Malaysia, mostly among the older generation or people with no working knowledge of English. The most important reason that contributed to the decline of Bazaar Malay is that pidgin Malay has creolised and created several new languages. Another reason is due to language shift in both formal and informal contexts, Bazaar Malay in Singapore is gradually being replaced by English, with English and its creole Singlish being the lingua franca among the younger generations.

==Sabah Malay==

A pidginised variant of standard Malay, Sabah Malay is a local trade or creole-based mixed language. There are a large number of native speakers in urban areas, mainly children who have it as first or second native language. There are also some speakers in the southernmost parts of the Philippines, particularly in the Sulu Archipelago as a trade language, also spoken in south Palawan. There are loanwords from Dusun, Tausug, Sama-Bajau languages, Chabacano, Brunei Malay, Indonesian, standard Malaysian as well as other ethnic native languages of Sabah &amp; North Kalimantan.
==Makassar Malay==

Makassar Malay is a creole-based mixed language, which is built of Bazaar Malay lexicon, Makassarese inflections, and mixed Malay/Makassarese syntax.

It is now widely spoken as the first language in Makassar City and its surrounding areas, especially those who were born after 1980&#x27;s. It has widely spread to the entire region in southern part of Sulawesi island, including in the provinces of Sulawesi Selatan, Sulawesi Tenggara, and Sulawesi Barat as regional lingua franca or as second language due to contact or doing business with people from Makassar City.

Makassar Malay used as a default dialect or neutral language when communicating with people from other tribes or ethnicities whom do not share the same local language to the native local speakers in those three provinces. It appears that Makassar Malay also used as the first language of younger generation who live in the cities or regencies&#x27; capital across those three provinces.

Furthermore, apart from those three provinces in the southern part of Sulawesi island, Makassar Malay also used by people in some parts of Sulawesi Tengah Province, especially when communicating with people from those three provinces. It can also be used when communicating with people from other people from other provinces in Eastern Indonesia and in the province of East Kalimantan.

==Balinese Malay==
Balinese Malay or Loloan Malay is a dialect of Malay spoken in the island of Bali. It is also known as (&quot;village speak&quot;) by its speakers. Balinese Malay is the primary language of ethnic Malay who live in the northwestern part of the island, mainly in the districts of Melaya and Negara, Jembrana Regency. The current language status is threatened.

* &quot;bərtəngkar&quot; becomes &quot;batengkar&quot;
* &quot;mənangis&quot; becomes &quot;manangis&quot;
*&quot;kəhidupan&quot; becomes &quot;kaidopan&quot;

===Alor Malay===

Alor Malay is spoken in the Alor archipelago. Speakers perceive Alor Malay to be a different register of standard Indonesian, but both of these are prestige varieties of the archipelago. Many people are able to understand standard Indonesian, but cannot speak it fluently and choose to use Alor Malay on a daily basis.

Alor Malay is based on Kupang Malay; however, Alor Malay differs significantly from Kupang Malay, especially in its pronouns.

===Ambonese Malay===
===Banda Malay===

=== Dili Malay ===
Dili Malay is a variety of trade Malay spoken in Dili, Timor Leste especially in the Kampung Alor area. According to experts, before becoming the mother tongue of a number of its speakers, this language was originally a pidgin language (Bloomfield, 1933; Hall, 1966). Then, in its development, this pidgin language became a creole language which was used in wider social interactions in society (Todd, 1974:50). Due to the long historical presence of the Portuguese in East Timor, several Dili Malay loanwords originate from Portuguese and Tetum, with little influences from other native languages.

===Gorap===

Gorap is a Malay-based creole language predominantly spoken by Gorap (&quot;Bobaneigo&quot;) ethnic group, indigenous to western and northern regions of the Indonesian island of Halmahera. It shares vocabulary with other Papuan languages and some of languages spoken in Sulawesi, such as Buginese and Cia-Cia. Roughly around 60 out of 200 attested words in this language were indicated sharing vocabulary with those languages.

===Larantuka Malay===

===Manado Malay===

===Sula Malay===
Sula Malay is a variety of Malay-based creole language which is generally used by multiethnic society in Sula Islands and Taliabu Island in the southwest part of North Maluku. The Sula Malay is heavily influenced by other languages, This can be found in loan words originating from Ambonese Malay and Dutch language can be found in Sula Malay. Some contraction vocabulary can also be found in this language, as is the case in North Moluccan Malay (Ternate Malay).

<text>The Rockaway River is a tributary of the Passaic River, approximately 35 mi (56 km) long, in Morris County, New Jersey in the United States. The upper course of the river flows through a wooded mountainous valley, whereas the lower course flows through the populated New Jersey suburbs and former industrial area west of New York City. It drains an area of approximately 130 sq mi (340 km²).

==Course==
The Rockaway River rises in the Oak Ridge neighborhood of Jefferson Township. It flows SSW, in a direct course between in the valley between the mountain ridges. Northeast of Wharton it emerges from the mountains and flows generally east in a meandering course, past Wharton, Dover (where it enters a concrete channel), Rockaway, Denville and Boonton, where it passes through the Boonton Gorge. The gorge begins with the impressive 25 foot Boonton Falls. It continues for a little over 1 mile (1.6 km) dropping around through nearly continuous class 3 and 4 whitewater. On the south side of Boonton it is impounded to form the Boonton Reservoir. Downstream from the reservoir dam it flows south, through Lake Hiawatha, where the river splits and joins again. It then flows through Parsippany and into Hatfield Swamp, where it is joined by the Whippany River and then merges with the Passaic River.

Beaver brook is a stream that flows through a swamp and enters the Rockaway River in Denville.

In the 19th century the river connected to the Morris Canal near Wharton and served as an industrial transportation link for shipping coal and iron ore between Pennsylvania and New York City. The communities of Wharton, Dover, and Boonton were important iron processing towns in the early 19th century, with a large concentration of forges and mills. The significant pollution problem in the lower course of the river has been somewhat alleviated by legislation and by the nearly complete abandonment of heavy industry in the area.

The isolated upper course of the river is a popular region site for smallmouth bass fishing.

The New Jersey Fish and Game stocks the river in many sections with rainbow and brown trout. Many fisherman find enjoyment in fishing the river.

The river is shown in the movie, &quot;The Station Agent&quot;, and also appears in one episode of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

==Flooding==
The Rockaway River has the potential to cause flooding in the area of Denville that is north of the central business district, including residential areas along the river. During the massive flooding following Hurricane Irene in August 2011, the Rockaway River crested approx. 6 feet above its previous record flood level. The flooding was considered to be a 500-year event. The downtown Denville business district and surrounding residential areas were flooded, by in some places up to 8 feet of water. As silt has accumulated in the river basin, the average depth of the river has steadily decreased. Since the flooding of Irene there have been no problems reported with the river overreaching its banks. Discussions are ongoing with the Township of Denville and the Army Corps of Engineers as to a solution, including the control of dams upstream which may have contributed to the downtown flooding.

<text>This is a survey of the [[postage stamp]]s and [[postal history]] of the [[Germany|German]] territory of the [[Saarland|Saar]]. As a border region contested between France and Germany, the Saar has a somewhat complicated philatelic history. (Note that although the state is now known as Saarland, English-speaking philatelists universally use &quot;Saar&quot;.)

== League of Nations administration ==
Originally a German territory of great interest to France, after World War I the Territory of the Saar Basin was to be administered by the League of Nations for a period of 15 years. In the absence of an existing nation to take over mail delivery, the League established its own postal administration.

The first stamps of the Saar were contemporary German stamps overprinted &quot;Sarre&quot; (the French name) and with a heavy solid bar striking out the &quot;DEUTSCHES REICH&quot; at the bottom of the stamp. This overprint was applied to 17 denominations, ranging from 2 pfennig to 1 mark, and first went on sale 30 January 1920. The stamps of Bavaria were overprinted similarly, and first available on 1 March. On 26 March, more German overprints were issued, this time reading &quot;SAARGEBIET&quot; (the German language name for Saar Territory) and not striking out the name of the old Reich.

Surcharges of 20pf, 5m, and 10m on German stamps came out in early 1921, followed by the Saar&#x27;s first definitive series. This was a set of 16 local scenes, ranging from a view of the Saar River near Mettlach to the Burbach Steelworks at Dillingen. The stamps were somewhat rudely typographed and most were printed in two colors; although bordering on the garish, they are striking nevertheless.

On 1 May 1921, the series was surcharged in centimes and francs, and in 1922 it was replaced by a new series of same designs, but redrawn, denominated in the new money, and printed in different colors.

The Madonna of Blieskastel was commemorated by a pair of stamps (45c and 10fr) in 1925, then in 1927 a new definitive series came out, still borrowing designs from the first series, but now in different shapes, and printed in a single color using photogravure. On 1 November 1934, in preparation for the plebiscite the following year, this series was overprinted &quot;VOLKSABSTIMMUNG / 1935&quot;; the plebiscite in January 1935 having gone in favor of rejoining Germany, Saar came under the German postal system.

== French protectorate ==

After World War II, Saar was one of the occupied areas to come under the administration of France. On 28 July 1945 the postal service in the Saar Area was separated from that in the French zone of occupation in Allied-occupied Germany, forming the &quot;Oberpostdirektion Saar&quot; (High Postal Directorate of the Saar) in Saarbrücken. Postal services were provided again starting in August 1945 for official purposes, and private mail, at the beginning to a restricted extent only, was resumed in September. 

On 17 November 1947 the Oberpostdirektion Saar was transformed into the &quot;Post-, Telegraphen- und Telephonverwaltung des Saarlandes&quot; (abbreviated like the French correspondent entity as P.T.T. Saarland; Post, Telegraph and Telephone Administration of the Saarland), keeping the headquarters in Saarbrücken. Postal vehicles and postboxes were green (RAL 6001), like in France. The French established the Saar Protectorate in December 1947.

The first stamps valid only in the Saar Area were issued in 1947. A first set of definitives came out in mid-1947, and included 17 stamps using six designs, including workers of various occupations, Mettlach Abbey, and Marshal Ney. Three of these values were also printed on paper watermarked with a pattern of curving lines. These first stamps were denominated in German currency, but just as before, were replaced in November by French currency denominations. The postal tariffs were adapted to the French system with mail to France at the domestic rate and mail to Allied-occupied Germany at the foreign tariff. The postal service of the Bizone subsumed mail to the Saar Protectorate under the foreign postage only as of 1 October 1948. 

On 1 April 1948 the P.T.T. Saarland issued a new series inscribed &quot;SAARPOST&quot;, followed by another in 1949 inscribed &quot;SAAR&quot;. The P.T.T. Saarland issued a few commemoratives each year through 1956, punctuated by a definitive set showing various buildings, in 1952.

After the 1955 Saar Statute referendum failed, France accepted the prevailing preference of the Saar population to return to Germany. So following that, mail to West Germany, East Germany or either part of Berlin was charged again with the domestic postage.

== German administration ==

On 1 January 1957 the P.T.T. Saarland was transformed into the Oberpostdirektion Saarbrücken of the Deutsche Bundespost. The return of the Saar Area to German control was commemorated on 1 January 1957 by a special stamps, then followed shortly thereafter by definitives with the then-standard profile of President Theodor Heuss, and inscribed both &quot;SAARLAND&quot; and &quot;DEUTSCHE BUNDESPOST&quot;. The numerals did not indicate a monetary system, but were implicitly francs; later in 1957, the stamps were reissued with a small &quot;F&quot; after the numeral.

Starting on 8 July 1957 mail from the Saarland to France, the French dominions, Italy and Luxembourg was not subsumed under the domestic tariff any more, but under a preferential postage granted until 30 June 1959, when the general foreign postage started to apply. 

Additional commemoratives appeared regularly for several more years while the German monetary system was re-established on 6 July 1959. The last postage stamp of the Saar was a single 15-franc issue honoring Alexander von Humboldt, which went on sale 6 May 1959. Thereafter Saarland used the regular stamps of the Federal Republic of Germany.

<doc id="624333" wikidata="Q970560" url="?curid=624333" title="Martin Bryant">
<text>Martin John Bryant (born 7 May 1967) is an Australian mass murderer who shot and killed thirty-five people and injured twenty-three others in the Port Arthur massacre on 28 and 29 April 1996. He is currently serving thirty-five life sentences, and 135 years without the possibility of parole, at Risdon Prison in Hobart, Tasmania.

==Early life==
Martin Bryant was born on 7 May 1967 at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Hobart, Tasmania. He was the first child of Maurice and Carleen Bryant. Although his family&#x27;s home was in Lenah Valley, Bryant spent some of his childhood at their beach home in Carnarvon Bay, adjacent to the Port Arthur Historic Site. In a 2011 interview, Bryant&#x27;s mother recalled that, when he was very young, she would often find his toys broken and that he was an &quot;annoying&quot; and &quot;different&quot; child. A psychiatrist who examined Bryant told the family that he would never be capable of holding down a job because he would aggravate people to such an extent that he would always be in trouble. In 1979, at age 12, Bryant was hospitalised at Royal Hobart Hospital from an injury caused by a firework accident. While in hospital, he was interviewed by a local television station.

Locals recall abnormal behaviour by Bryant, such as pulling the snorkel from another boy while diving and cutting down trees on a neighbour&#x27;s property. At school he was a disruptive and sometimes violent student who suffered severe bullying by other children. Bryant was described by teachers as being distant from reality and unemotional. After he was suspended from New Town Primary School in 1977, psychological assessments noted that he tortured animals. Bryant returned to school the following year with improved behaviour but he persisted in teasing younger children. He was transferred to a special education unit at New Town High School in 1980, where he deteriorated both academically and behaviourally throughout his remaining school years.

=== Psychological and psychiatric assessments ===
Descriptions of Bryant&#x27;s behaviour as an adolescent show that he continued to be disturbed and outlined the possibility of an intellectual disability. When leaving school in 1983, he was assessed for a disability pension by a psychiatrist who wrote: &quot;Cannot read or write. Does a bit of gardening and watches TV ... Only his parents&#x27; efforts that prevent further deterioration. Could be schizophrenic and parents face a bleak future with him.&quot; Bryant received a disability pension, though he also worked as a handyman and gardener. In an examination after the massacre, forensic psychologist Ian Joblin found Bryant to be borderline mentally disabled with an IQ of 66, equivalent to an 11-year-old.

While awaiting trial, Bryant was examined by court-appointed psychiatrist Ian Sale, who was of the opinion that Bryant &quot;could be regarded as having shown a mixture of conduct disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity and a rare condition known as Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome&quot;. Psychiatrist Paul Mullen, hired at the request of Bryant&#x27;s legal counsel, found that he was socially and intellectually impaired. Furthermore, finding that he did not display signs of schizophrenia or a mood disorder, Mullen concluded, &quot;though Mr Bryant was clearly a distressed and disturbed young man he was not mentally ill.&quot;

== Adulthood and suspicious deaths ==
In early 1987, when Bryant was aged 19, he met 54-year-old Helen Mary Elizabeth Harvey, heiress to a share in the Tattersall&#x27;s lottery fortune, while looking for new customers for his lawn-mowing service. Helen, who lived with her mother Hilza, befriended Bryant, who became a regular visitor to her neglected mansion in New Town and assisted with tasks such as feeding the fourteen dogs living inside the mansion and the forty cats living inside her garage. In June 1990, an unidentified person reported Helen to the health authorities, and medics found both Helen and her mother in need of urgent hospital treatment. With Helen suffering from infected ulcers and Hilza with a hip fracture, Hilza was moved into a nursing home and died several weeks later at the age of 79.

A mandatory clean-up order was placed on the Harvey mansion, and Bryant&#x27;s father took long-service leave to assist in cleaning the interior. The local RSPCA unit had to confiscate many animals living in the house. Following the clean-up, Helen Harvey invited Bryant to live with her in the mansion and they began spending extravagant amounts of money, which included the purchase of more than thirty new cars in less than three years. The unconventional pair spent most of their time together extensively shopping, usually after having lunch in a local restaurant. Around this time, Bryant was reassessed for his disability pension and a note was attached to the paperwork: &quot;Father protects him from any occasion which might upset him as he continually threatens violence ... Martin tells me he would like to go around shooting people. It would be unsafe to allow Martin out of his parents&#x27; control.&quot;

In 1991, as a result of no longer being allowed to have animals at the mansion, Harvey and Bryant moved together onto a farm called Taurusville that Harvey had purchased in the small township of Copping. Neighbours recalled that Bryant always carried an air gun and often fired it at tourists as they stopped to buy apples at a stall on the highway and that late at night, he would roam through the surrounding properties firing the gun at dogs when they barked at him. Residents in Copping avoided Bryant &quot;at all costs&quot; despite his attempts to befriend them.

On 20 October 1992, Harvey, aged 59, was killed along with two of her dogs when her car veered onto the wrong side of the road and hit an oncoming car directly. Bryant was inside the vehicle at the time of the accident and was hospitalised for seven months with severe neck and back injuries. He returned to his family&#x27;s home to convalesce after leaving hospital. Bryant was briefly investigated by police for the role he played in the accident, as he had a known habit of lunging for the steering wheel and Harvey had already had three accidents as a result. Harvey often told people that this was the reason she never drove faster than 60 kilometres an hour (37 mph). Harvey even allegedly said to a neighbour that &quot;one of these days the little bastard [Bryant] is going to kill me.&quot; Bryant was named the sole beneficiary of Harvey&#x27;s will and came into possession of assets totalling more than AU$550,000. As Bryant had only the &quot;vaguest notions&quot; of financial matters, his mother subsequently applied for and was granted a guardianship order, placing his assets under the management of public trustees. The order was based on evidence of Bryant&#x27;s diminished intellectual capacity.

After Harvey&#x27;s death, Bryant&#x27;s father Maurice, aged 60, looked after the Copping farm. Maurice had been prescribed antidepressants and had discreetly transferred his joint bank account and utilities into his wife&#x27;s name. Two months later, on 14 August 1993, a visitor looking for Maurice at the Copping property found a note saying &quot;call the police&quot; pinned to the door and found several thousand dollars in his car. The rates officer at the time found no reason to suspect criminal intent and sent council members and police to quell the stresses put forward by letters sent to the local council chambers. Police searched the property for Maurice without success. Divers were called to search the four dams on the property, and on 16 August Maurice&#x27;s body was found in the dam closest to the farmhouse, with a diving weight belt around his neck. Police described the death as &quot;unnatural&quot; and it was ruled a suicide. Bryant inherited the proceeds of his father&#x27;s superannuation fund, valued at AU$250,000.

Bryant later sold the Copping farm for AU$143,000 and kept the former Harvey mansion. While living at Copping, the white overalls he habitually wore were replaced with clothing more in line with Harvey&#x27;s financial status. Now that he was alone, Bryant&#x27;s fashion sense became more eccentric; he often wore a grey linen suit, cravat, lizard-skin shoes and a Panama hat while carrying a briefcase during the day, telling anyone who would listen that he had a high paying career as a businessman. Bryant often wore an electric-blue suit with flared trousers and a ruffled shirt to the restaurant he frequented. The restaurant owner recalled: &quot;It was horrible. Everyone was laughing at him, even the customers. I really felt suddenly quite sorry for him. I realised this guy didn&#x27;t really have any friends.&quot;

With both Harvey and his father dead, Bryant became increasingly lonely. From 1993 to late 1995, he travelled overseas fourteen times and a summary of his domestic airline travel filled three pages. However, Bryant had felt as lonely travelling as he did at home in Tasmania. He enjoyed the flights, as he could speak to the people sitting adjacent to him who had no choice but to be polite. He later took great joy in describing some of the conversations he had with fellow passengers. Bryant ultimately became suicidal after deciding he had &quot;had enough&quot;, stating, &quot;I just felt more people were against me. When I tried to be friendly toward them, they just walked away.&quot; Although he had previously been little more than a social drinker, Bryant&#x27;s alcohol consumption increased and, although he had not consumed any alcohol on the day of the massacre, had especially escalated in the six months prior to that day. His average daily consumption was estimated at half a bottle of Sambuca and a bottle of Baileys Irish Cream, supplemented with port wine and other sweet alcoholic drinks. According to Bryant, he thought the plan for the massacre might have first occurred to him four to twelve weeks before the event.

== Port Arthur massacre ==

Bryant has provided conflicting and confused accounts of what led him to kill thirty-five people at the Port Arthur site on 28 April 1996. It could have been his desire for attention, as he allegedly told a next-door neighbour, &quot;I&#x27;ll do something that will make everyone remember me.&quot; His defence psychiatrist, Paul Mullen, former chief of forensic psychiatry at Monash University, said Bryant became fascinated with the Dunblane massacre in Scotland: &quot;He followed Dunblane. His planning started with Dunblane. Before that he was thinking about suicide, but Dunblane and the early portrayal of the killer, Thomas Hamilton, changed everything&quot;.

Bryant&#x27;s first victims, David and Noelene Martin, owned the bed and breakfast guest house called &quot;Seascape&quot;. The Martins had beaten Bryant&#x27;s father in purchasing the bed and breakfast, and his father had complained to Bryant on numerous occasions of the damage done to their family because of that purchase. Bryant apparently believed the Martins bought the property out of spite towards his family and blamed them for causing the depression that led to his father&#x27;s suicide. He fatally shot the Martins in the guest house and stole their weapons and the property keys before travelling to the Port Arthur site.

At Port Arthur, Bryant entered the Broad Arrow Café on the grounds of the historic site, carrying a large blue sports bag. While he was eating, Bryant attempted to start conversations with random people about the lack of wasps in the area and the lack of usual Japanese tourists. Once he finished eating, Bryant moved toward the back of the café and set a video camera on a vacant table. He took out a Colt AR-15 SP1 Carbine (semi-automatic rifle) and, firing from the hip, began shooting patrons and staff. Within fifteen seconds, he had fired seventeen shots, killing twelve people and wounding ten. Bryant then walked to the other side of the shop and fired twelve more times, killing another eight people while wounding two. He then changed magazines before fleeing, shooting at people in the car park and from his yellow Volvo 244 car as he drove away; an additional four were killed and six were injured.

Bryant drove 300 metres down the road, to where a woman and her two children were walking. He stopped and fired two shots, killing the woman and the child she was carrying. The older child fled, but Bryant followed her and killed her with a single shot. He then stole a 1980 gold BMW 7 series by killing all four of its occupants. A short distance down the road, he stopped beside a couple in a white Toyota and, drawing his weapon, ordered the male occupant into the boot of the BMW. After shutting the boot, he fired two shots into the windscreen of the Toyota, killing the female driver.

Bryant returned to the guest house, set the stolen car alight and took his hostage inside, where he had left the Martins&#x27; corpses. The police tried to negotiate with Bryant for many hours before the battery in the phone he was using ran out, ending communication. Bryant&#x27;s only demand was to be transported in an Australian Army helicopter to an airport. During the negotiations, Bryant killed his hostage. The following morning, eighteen hours later, Bryant set fire to the guest house and attempted to escape in the confusion. Suffering burns to his back and buttocks, Bryant was captured and taken to Royal Hobart Hospital, where he was treated and kept under heavy guard.

===Imprisonment===
Bryant was judged fit to stand trial, which was scheduled to begin on 7 November 1996. He initially pleaded not guilty but was persuaded by his court-appointed lawyer, John Avery, to plead guilty to all charges. Two weeks later, on 22 November 1996, Hobart Supreme Court Judge William Cox gave Bryant thirty-five life sentences, plus 1,652 years in prison, without the possibility of parole, all of which is to be served concurrently; this life sentence being applied is &quot;for the term of [his] natural life&quot;.

For the first eight months of his imprisonment, Bryant was held in a purpose-built suicide-prevention cell in almost complete solitary confinement. He remained in protective custody for his own safety until 13 November 2006, when he was moved into Hobart&#x27;s Wilfred Lopes Centre, a secure mental health unit run by the Tasmanian Department of Health and Human Services. The thirty-five bed unit for inmates with serious mental illness is staffed with doctors, nurses and other support workers. Inmates are not locked down and can come and go from their cells. Exterior security at the facility is provided by a three-wall perimeter patrolled by private contract guards. 

On 5 July 2003, an incident occurred that led an inmate to spray a cleaning solution into Bryant&#x27;s eyes. He was transferred to Royal Hobart Hospital. On 25 March 2007, Bryant attempted to end his life by slashing his wrist with a razor blade. On 27 March he cut his throat with another razor blade and was hospitalised briefly. Bryant is currently housed in the maximum-security Risdon Prison near Hobart.

===Media coverage===
Newspaper coverage immediately after the massacre raised serious questions about journalistic practices, and criticism was directed toward Australian media. Photographs of Bryant published in &quot;The Australian&quot; had his eyes digitally manipulated with the effect of making him appear deranged and &quot;glaring&quot;. Despite the criticism, the manipulated photographs continued to be used in media reporting a decade later. There were also questions as to how the photos had been obtained.

The Tasmanian director of public prosecutions warned media that the coverage compromised Bryant&#x27;s right to a fair trial and writs were issued against &quot;The Australian&quot;, the Hobart &quot;Mercury&quot; (which used Bryant&#x27;s picture under the headline &quot;This is the Man&quot;), &quot;The Age&quot; and the ABC. The chairman of the Australian Press Council at the time, David Flint, argued that because newspapers regularly ignored contempt-of-court provisions, this showed that the law, not the newspapers, needed change. Flint suggested that such a change in the law would not necessarily lead to trial by media. Australian newspapers also came under critical scrutiny of their accounts of Bryant and how the kind of identity responsible for his and other similar kinds of killing might be understood.

=== Political aftermath ===
As a response to the massacre, Australian state and territory governments introduced extensive restrictions on all firearms, including semi-automatic centre-fire rifles, repeating shotguns (holding more than five shots) and high-capacity rifle magazines. In addition, limitations were imposed on low-capacity repeating shotguns and rim-fire semi-automatic rifles. Though the measures caused controversy, opposition to the new laws was lessened by media reporting of the massacre and mounting public opinion.

==In popular culture==
In March 2012, Sydney artist Rodney Pople controversially won the AU$35,000 Glover Prize for his landscape painting depicting Port Arthur with Bryant in the foreground holding a firearm. In 2019, the massacre was referenced in the lyrics of Pond&#x27;s song, &quot;The Boys Are Killing Me&quot;, featured on their album &quot;Tasmania&quot;. The 2021 film &quot;Nitram&quot;, directed by Justin Kurzel, is based on Bryant&#x27;s life, with Caleb Landry Jones in the role of Bryant. Jones won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor for his portrayal.

<text>Al Iraqiya () is an Iraqi satellite and terrestrial public broadcaster and television network. The channel is part of the larger Iraqi Media Network, and was set up after the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the ousting of Saddam Hussein. It is primarily an Arabic language network that serves upwards of 85% of Iraq&#x27;s population, and is viewed by a significant percentage (about 40%). The channel currently broadcasts in the Arabic, Kurdish, Turkmen, and Neo-Aramaic languages and dialects.

==History==
The Iraqi Media Network, which manages the channel, was created in 2004 as a successor to Ba&#x27;ath-run media. The channel began under the name IMN as part of the Iraqi Media Network (شبكة الإعلام العراقي) project undertaken. The Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) was the contractor for this Defense Department project. The channel received funding from the U.S. government and played a major role in reporting news surrounding the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the execution of Saddam Hussein.

On 31 May 2006, Ali Jaafar, a sports anchorman for the channel, was killed in Baghdad by unidentified gunmen. It&#x27;s believed that he was killed due to his affiliation with the channel, which was supported by the U.S. government at the time.

Included in the programming is the very aggressive Political Actuality program &quot;Burning Issues&quot; that tackles the very sensitive subject of terrorism in Iraq, hosting both the victims and the arrested/convicted perpetrators.

In 2015, the channel was upgraded to high-definition television thanks to a partnership with Imagine Communications, and two channels (Al Iraqiya News and Al Iraqiya Turkmen) were upgraded. In the same year, a law was passed that classified the channel as part of the legal framework of Iraq and the Council of Representatives. Harris Corporation took over the project from SAIC and completed—on time and in budget—two TV channels, a national newspaper, and radio stations. 

In 2020, the then-director of Al Iraqiya, Haidar Hassan Obeid, was dismissed from his position and was replaced by Abbas Hamzouz Jakhyour.

===Opening of Syriac channel===
On the eve of Kha b-Nisan in 2023, the head of IMN, Nabil Jassim, announced the launch of a new channel for Al Iraqiya that would broadcast in both Classical Syriac and contemporary Neo-Aramaic dialects. Jassim stressed the importance of opening the channel as one that would unite all the ethnic components of Iraq, and celebrated the opening of the channel as the first of its kind in the Arab world. The ceremony was attended by Minister Evan Faiq Jabro, as well as Greek Orthodox Priest Younan Al-Farid and a delegation of the General Directorate of Syriac Studies from the Kurdish region. Other officials and guests in attendance congratulated the network and the people involved on the launch, expressing their enthusiasm and the importance of maintaining the rich history of the region through the language. 

The opening of the channel was not only hailed by people in Iraq, but observers outside of the country, especially the Assyrian diaspora. In an interview with The World, Jack Anwia, director of the channel, discussed the importance of the channel and its role in preserving Classical Syriac and other components of the larger Syriac language. The article also mentioned that there were currently 40 people working on the channel, and that they had an array of programs hosted that covered news and other topics.

In September 2024, the channel released an interview with Assyrian singer Evin Agassi, in light of his death around the same time.

==Criticism==
From its&#x27; founding and in recent years, Al Iraqiya and the Iraqi Media Network have been criticized for its&#x27; often sectarian nature. The Media and Journalism Research Center noted that a majority of the board members of IMN, who controls the channel, were affiliated with Iran-backed militant groups, and those who publicly criticize the Iraqi government risk losing their jobs within the organization. In 2023, three new board members were elected, each having ties to Ketaib Hezbollah, Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, and the Babylon Brigade. The majority presence of board members affiliated with these organizations has been linked to Rayan al-Kildani, who pushes issues relating to the organizations amongst them.

After the Fall of Mosul and the beginning of the War against the Islamic State, the channel began pushing symbols and slogans notable to Shia Muslims, while discussing the many damages that Iraqi military commanders had made against Sunni Muslim militants. Observers noted how the change in graphics on Al Iraqiya, as well as pro-Sunni channels, reflected the sectarian divide between Sunnis and Shias post-2003.

In 2019, in the wake of the Tishreen Movement, protestors closed the stations of the channel in the Maysan Governorate of southeastern Iraq. The studio closure followed previous attempts to close down studios in Dhi Qar, due to objections over the channel&#x27;s coverage of the protests. Two journalists who posted about the protests on social media were also prevented from receiving their wages, and were also subjected to interrogation by an inner committee. The latter reflected the ever-growing tension against journalists during the protests, and the level of press freedom in Iraq.

In the same year, the channel was also criticized for filming an interview with a former Yezidi sex slave, Ashwaq Haji Hamid, and a former ISIS member, Abu Hamam. Independent observers in Germany believed that the interview took more focus away from the victim than the perpetrator, and that the confrontation could re-open the traumatic memories for the victim.

<text>South East Asia Command (SEAC) was the body set up to be in overall charge of Allied operations in the South-East Asian Theatre during the Second World War.

==History==
===Organisation===
The initial supreme commander of the theatre was General Sir Archibald Wavell while head of the short-lived American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM) which was dissolved after the fall of Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. On 30 March 1942 the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued instructions naming General Douglas MacArthur as commander-in-chief of the South West Pacific Area, which was made responsible for the water areas of the South China Sea, Borneo, and Java.

In August 1943, the Allies created the combined South East Asian Command, to assume overall command of air, sea and land operations in the theatre. In August 1943, with the agreement of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, Winston Churchill appointed Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten as Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia. US Army General Joseph Stilwell was appointed deputy supreme commander. Stilwell was also, officially, deputy to Chiang Kai Shek, as Allied commander in China, and commanded all US forces across both theatres (which were known in the US as the China Burma India (CBI) Theater). Meanwhile the British Army commander in India, Auchinleck as Commander-in-Chief, India, provided vital base support.

Mountbatten arrived in India on 7 October and SEAC came formally into being in Delhi at midnight on 15/16 November.

SEAC headquarters moved in April 1944 to Kandy in Ceylon.

===General strategy===
From the outset, Western Allied forces available for the wider war against Japan were limited – by an overall Allied commitment towards defeating Nazi Germany, before the Empire of Japan. This was especially the case for the UK, and major advances were not anticipated in Asia until mid-late 1944 at least – that is, not until the defeat of Germany had become inevitable.

A strategic focus by the Western Allies on the Central Pacific (i.e. the &quot;Pacific Ocean Areas&quot; in contemporaneous Allied terminology) and the South-West Pacific, resulted from compromises reached at the Casablanca Conference. UK participants were focused on Nazi Germany, and saw the war against Japan being limited &quot;to the defense of a fixed line in front of those positions that must be held&quot;. However, because such an approach was unacceptable to the United States, it was agreed that there would be offensive actions in Burma, operations in support of China, and other activity beyond holding a defensive line in South East Asia, as a result of US demands that the Japanese be kept off-balance, throughout any areas in which they might encounter Allied forces. Nevertheless, for the Western Allies, the South East Asia theatre, China, and the North Pacific (including Alaska), were destined to become secondary theatres, relative to efforts in the Pacific Ocean Areas, in which the supreme commander was US Admiral Chester Nimitz. Some saw SEAC as an organization for recapturing colonial possessions. The British also sometimes appeared to be more interested in liberating their own Asian possessions than the Americans did. This led Washington to try to distance itself from SEAC politically.

On 2 December 1943, the Combined Chiefs of Staff officially approved in principle a plan designating the Pacific Ocean Areas as the focus of the main effort against Japan. Their reasoning was that advances in the Central Pacific were the most rapid route towards sustained, direct attacks on the Japanese Home Islands – e.g. subjecting Tokyo and other major cities to attacks by strategic bombers. A secondary line of advance – by US and Australian forces – &quot;along the New Guinea-N.E.I.-Philippine axis&quot;, was to be controlled by the separate South West Pacific Area command under Douglas MacArthur (US Army).

==Description==
The initial land forces operational area for SEAC was India, Burma, Ceylon, Malaya, northern islands of Sumatra, and, for offensive operations, Siam (Thailand). On 15 August 1945 (VJ-Day) this was expanded to include the rest parts of Dutch East Indies and southern part of French Indochina.

Command arrangements in SEAC were always complicated. Ideally there should have been under the Supreme Commander a Commander in Chief for each of the land sea and air forces. This was implemented for the naval and air forces (including the establishment of Air Command, South East Asia) but the British 11th Army Group, under SEAC itself, controlled only British land forces. US and Chinese forces serving in the South East Asian theatre, organised as the Northern Combat Area Command or NCAC commanded by Stilwell, answered directly to the Supreme Commander because Stilwell refused to serve under the 11th Army Group commander George Giffard. The Eleventh Army Group had the Fourteenth Army on the Burma front, and the British garrison in Ceylon under its direct command. Stilwell also served as Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek, who was officially the Supreme Allied Commander in China. Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Peirse was appointed the Air Commander in Chief under Mountbatten. Air units taking part in the Burma Campaign were, at first, part of either the RAF Third Tactical Air Force or the USAAF Tenth Air Force. Tenth Air Force came under SEAC only through Stilwell as commanding General CBI Theater. To avoid a potentially cumbersome chain of command and overlapping effort Mountbatten gave orders in December for the two air forces to be integrated under the name Eastern Air Command. The US Fourteenth Air Force, which was based in China and the US Twentieth Air Force – strategic bomber units based in India – were never controlled by SEAC but their operations were coordinated with SEAC. At sea, the command structure was relatively simple, since the Royal Navy was providing almost all naval forces in the area. Admiral Sir James Somerville, Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet, became the naval commander under Mountbatten.

It was not until late 1944 that the land forces chain of command was clarified, after Stilwell was recalled to Washington. His overall role, and the CBI command were then split among three people: Lt Gen. Raymond Wheeler became Deputy Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia; Maj. Gen. Albert Wedemeyer became Chief of Staff to Chiang, and commander of US Forces, China Theater (USFCT). Lt Gen. Daniel Sultan was promoted, from deputy commander of CBI to commander of US Forces, India-Burma Theater (USFIBT) and commander of the NCAC. The 11th Army Group was redesignated Allied Land Forces South East Asia (ALFSEA) under a new commander Lieutenant-General Oliver Leese who had relinquished command of the Eighth Army in Italy, and NCAC (which by this time included Chinese, American and British units) was placed under ALFSEA. As the drive to liberate Burma began in earnest however, Chiang Kai-shek and Wedemeyer made increasing demands for NCAC&#x27;s formations to be moved to the China Theatre to meet the threat of Japanese attacks from the north. Once the Burma Road from Mandalay to Chungking was secured NCAC became passive and in March 1945 Mountbatten agreed to the US and Chinese troops in NCAC being gradually withdrawn to the China.

RAF aircraft destined for SEAC had the word &quot;SNAKE&quot; applied after the serial during ferrying to prevent them being appropriated by other commands along the route.

In February 1945 Air Marshal Keith Park was appointed Allied Air Commander of South-East Asia Command [SEAC] where he served until the end of the war.

Once most of Burma was re-captured by Fourteenth Army, the command turned its attention towards its next major operational objective: Malaya. However, the use of atomic bombs on the Japanese mainland brought the war to an abrupt end.

==Post–war==
The borders of SEAC were adjusted in the aftermath of the war, and its emphasis shifted from combat operations to military government. French Indochina was added, along with Borneo – most of which had already been captured by Australian forces, under the South West Pacific Command – and Java. The command became responsible for over 128 million people, with at least 120,000 of them still under Japanese custody. This added immensely to its problems. At the same time, Western governments expected SEAC to re-establish colonial regimes in territories lost to Japan in 1941–45 where nationalist, anti-colonial forces had gained strength.

After Japan&#x27;s surrender, Lt. General Itagaki Seishiro, who commanded the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Southeast Asia, were sent to Tokyo to stand trial for war crime. His soldiers who guarded the Jurong and Changi prisons in Singapore became captives of their former Allied prisoners. The British soon put these captives to work filling bomb craters, cleaning toilets, and cutting grass. They marched to their work sites each morning and back to their prisons at night. There were bouts of violence targeting former Japanese soldiers, but there were also offers of help to those Japanese civilians that were still waiting to be repatriated.

Food shortages were everywhere. Requisitions by the Japanese military during the war had encouraged the hoarding but discouraged the growing of rice. Migrations to urban areas, where rations were rumored to be more available, worsened the situation. In Kuala Lumpur, Pahang, Kelantan, Trengganu, and Singapore, over 20 per cent of children were undersized or malnourished for their age. The British tried to bring in as much food as they could, but the system of rationing soon broke down. Prices soared, and a black market for British military ration flourished. Rising inflation was made worse after the British demonetized the Japanese occupation currency. A wave of strikes swept Singapore, led by Communist leaning labour unions and hundreds of thousands their members.

British Commonwealth troops were landed in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) and French Indochina to facilitate the return of forces from the pre-war colonial powers. The formation deployed to the East Indies was the Indian XV Corps under command of Lieutenant General Sir Philip Christison, which included 5th Indian Infantry Division, 23rd Indian Infantry Division and 5th Parachute Brigade. Military government was soon established in Burma, Malaya, Singapore and British Borneo. Sarawak and Sumatra did not prove to be major headaches for the British, except that one Japanese unit in Borneo refused to surrender until November 1945.

Thailand, although it had officially been an ally of Japan, quickly resumed both its independence and its ties with the western powers.

Because of shortages of personnel, some use was made of Japanese Surrendered Personnel (JSP) in these areas. The Allies found that their war-time allies in the Viet Minh in Indochina, and Indonesian nationalist forces in the East Indies, were well armed, well-organised and determined. It was intended that British forces would temporarily enforce military government over a small section of Indochina, because of local resistance, logistics and French sensibilities. However, in the end the commander of British forces declared &quot;de facto&quot; military government, to make it possible for French forces to return.

===Indonesian National Revolution, 1945–46===
Aided by armed militias formed by the Japanese during the occupation, Indonesian nationalists in Java declared the Dutch East Indies a republic, and independent from the Netherlands. The British intended that the Dutch colonial administration should return, and assisted a small military contingent, the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA). However they initially avoided significant conflict with the nationalists. It was only possible for British forces to establish military government in parts of Indonesia, and they found that the location of Allied prisoners of war – and civilians interned by Japanese forces – were sometimes used by nationalists in bargaining for political ends.

British troops found themselves in increasing conflict with the nationalists. The nationalists attacked JSP garrisons awaiting repatriation, to seize their arms. A British Brigadier, A. W. S. Mallaby, was killed, as he pushed for the nationalists to surrender their weapons. As a result, on 10 November 1945, Surabaya was attacked by British forces, leading to the bloody Battle of Surabaya. The city was secured later that month. The battle for Surabaya was the bloodiest single engagement of the Indonesian National Revolution (1945–49). However, the British were reluctant to devote their scarce resources to a defence of Dutch interests, and withdrew from Indonesia.

==Disbandment==

As 1946 drew on, under its second and final commander, Lieutenant-General Montagu Stopford (June to November 1946), SEAC discharged its final tasks and was disbanded. It was no longer felt that a joint command was needed in the area.

<text>Henri Debehogne (30 December 1928 – 9 December 2007) was a Belgian astronomer and a prolific discoverer of minor planets.

== Biography ==

He was born at Maillen. Debehogne worked at the Royal Observatory of Belgium () in Uccle, and specialized in astrometry of comets and minor planets.

He is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of over 700 numbered minor planets, including the Trojan asteroids 6090 Aulis and 65210 Stichius (the latter with Eric Walter Elst) and hundreds of asteroids of the main-belt.

He died on 9 December 2007, at the age of 78 in Uccle. The asteroid 2359 Debehogne was named in his honor.

<doc id="624345" wikidata="Q703057" url="?curid=624345" title="Mickey Marcus">
<text>David Daniel &quot;Mickey&quot; Marcus (February 22, 1901 – June 10, 1948) was a United States Army colonel, later Israel&#x27;s first General, who was a principal architect of the U.S. military&#x27;s World War II civil affairs policies, including the organization of the war crimes trials in Germany and in Japan.

He assisted Israel during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, one of the well known Israeli Machal soldiers, becoming Israel&#x27;s first modern general (Hebrew: Aluf). He was killed by friendly fire. He was portrayed by Kirk Douglas in the 1966 Hollywood movie &quot;Cast a Giant Shadow,&quot; which focused on his role in the Israeli war.

==Early life==
Marcus&#x27;s Jewish parents, Mordechai Marcus and Leah Marcus (&quot;née&quot; Goldstein), came from Iași, Romania. Born on Hester Street on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, Marcus was bright and athletic. He attended Boys&#x27; High School, in Brooklyn, and was then accepted at West Point in 1920 and graduated with the class of 1924. After completing his active duty requirement, he attended Brooklyn Law School. He spent most of the 1930s as an Assistant United States Attorney in New York, prosecuting gangsters such as Lucky Luciano. In 1940, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia named Marcus Commissioner of the New York City Department of Correction for the City of New York.

==World War II==
After leaving active duty, Marcus had continued his army service in the Organized Reserve Corps. In 1939, he joined the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps, and became Judge Advocate of his Army National Guard unit, the 27th Infantry Division, which was federalized in 1940. Though as a legal officer, he was not supposed to command troops, he wrangled a unit command during the 1941 Louisiana Maneuvers.

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the 27th Division deployed to Hawaii. There, Marcus organized and commanded a Ranger Combat Training School, to provide troop training in methods of unarmed defense to combat Japanese infiltration tactics. But instead of a field command, Marcus was sent to Washington in 1943. He was assigned to the Civil Affairs Division, as chief of planning for occupation governments in territories liberated from the Axis. He accompanied U.S. delegations to the conferences at Cairo, Teheran, Yalta and Potsdam, and helped draft the 1943 surrender terms for Italy.

In May 1944, Marcus got himself sent to the United Kingdom on Civil Affairs business. He then traded on being a West Point classmate of General Maxwell D. Taylor to parachute into Normandy on D-Day with the first wave of Taylor&#x27;s 101st Airborne Division, despite having no paratrooper training. He took informal command of some of the scattered paratroopers and was in combat for a week. He was then sent back to the United States.

After V-E Day in 1945, General Lucius D. Clay asked for Marcus to serve on his staff in the occupation of Germany. Marcus was in charge of providing for the millions of displaced persons in Germany. Clay required all his subordinates to tour the Dachau concentration camp. Marcus was shocked by its horrors; though not previously a Zionist, he began to think differently about a Jewish state.

In 1946, he was named chief of the Army&#x27;s War Crimes Division in Washington, planning legal and security procedures for the Nuremberg trials and the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal. He attended the Nuremberg trials, making sure that Nazi crimes were thoroughly documented. After the trials, he was offered promotion to brigadier general, but instead elected to return to civilian life and his law practice.

In recognition of his service in &quot;negotiation and drafting of the Italian Surrender Instrument, the Instrument of Unconditional Surrender of Germany, and the international machinery to be used for the control of Germany after her total defeat&quot; he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. In 1946, he was named an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire, ‘in recognition of the distinguished service performed … in cooperation with British armed forces during the war.&quot; He also was awarded the Bronze Star and other awards.

==Israeli military career==
In 1947, David Ben-Gurion asked Marcus to recruit a U.S. officer to serve as military advisor to the nascent Israeli army, the Haganah. He could not recruit anyone suitable, so Marcus volunteered himself. In 1948, the National Military Establishment informally acquiesced to Marcus&#x27; undertaking, provided he disguised his name and rank to avoid problems with the British authorities in Mandatory Palestine.

Under the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; &quot;Michael Stone&quot;, he arrived in Palestine in January 1948. Arab armies surrounded the soon-to-be declared State of Israel.

He designed a command and control structure for the Haganah, adapting his U.S. Army experience to its special needs. He identified Israel&#x27;s weakest points in the Negev south, and the Jerusalem area.

Marcus was appointed &quot;Aluf&quot; (&quot;general&quot;) and given command of the Jerusalem front on May 28, 1948. As no ranks had been granted to the Israeli high command at that time, he became the first general in the fledgling nation&#x27;s army (see Israel Defense Forces). (&quot;Aluf&quot; was then equivalent to brigadier general but since 1967, &quot;Aluf&quot; has been equivalent to major general.)

He participated in planning Operations Bin Nun Bet and Yoram against the Latrun fort, held by the Arab Legion, which blocked the road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which was under siege. Both attacks failed, but Marcus then built the &quot;Burma Road to Jerusalem&quot; – a makeshift winding road through difficult hill terrain, nicknamed after the World War II supply route to China. His &quot;Burma Road&quot; was opened to vehicles on June 10, breaking the siege of Jerusalem, a day before a United Nations ceasefire took effect.

==Death==
A few hours before the cease fire, Marcus returned to his Central Front headquarters. He and his commanders were billeted in the monks&#x27; quarters of the abandoned Monastere Notre Dame de la Nouvelle Alliance in Abu Ghosh. Shortly before 4:00 a.m., 18-year-old Eliezer Linski, a one-year Palmach veteran, challenged Marcus, who he saw as a figure in white.

When Marcus failed to respond with the password, Linski fired in the air and the man ran towards the monastery. He fired at the man, as did one or more fighters in a nearby sentry post. Marcus was found dead, wrapped in a white blanket. Marcus knew very little Hebrew and had responded in English, which Linski did not understand. Marcus wore no rank, although officers had been recognized by a ribbon pinned to their uniforms. As Marcus&#x27; body was removed from Abu Ghosh, a ribbon was found and placed on his casket. Harry Levin wrote that &quot;[d]iscovering who he had killed, the soldier tried to shoot himself, but was disarmed&quot;.

His body was returned to the United States for burial at West Point, accompanied by Moshe Dayan and his wife Ruth, Yoseph Harel, and the wife of his aide de camp, Alex Broida. His burial, with military honors, was attended by Governor of New York Thomas Dewey, former Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, and General Maxwell Taylor, then Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point.

Ben-Gurion was suspicious of the initial report that Marcus had been shot accidentally. The Haganah was composed of several factions whose lack of consensus over strategy and tactics was one of the reasons for Marcus&#x27; appointment as commander for Jerusalem, and Ben-Gurion suspected that elements in the Palmach may have conspired to kill Marcus so he would be replaced. On the same day Marcus was shot, Ben-Gurion summoned Yaakov Shimshon Shapira—later Israel&#x27;s Attorney General—and asked him to investigate the incident. Shapira&#x27;s investigation was cursory. Despite conflicting reports concerning the number of shots fired, how many wounds Marcus suffered, whether the fatal wound could have been caused by Linski&#x27;s rifle, and how and why Marcus may have been outside the monastery, he concluded that Linski shot Marcus in the line of duty. The report has never been made public.

==Legacy==

Marcus&#x27; grave is the only one in the West Point Cemetery at the United States Military Academy for an American killed fighting under the flag of another country; he was still eligible for interment there because he was a graduate of the academy who served honorably. His paratrooper helmet and Walther Model 9 pistol are displayed at the West Point museum. His gravestone at West Point reads: 
:&quot;Colonel David Marcus—a Soldier for All Humanity&quot;.
A memorial plaque in his honor is located in the lobby of the Union Temple of Brooklyn where his funeral service was conducted. It reads:
:&quot;Killed in action in the hills of Zion while leading Israeli forces as their supreme commander in the struggle for Israel&#x27;s freedom—Blessed is the match that is consumed in kindling flame/ Blessed is the flame that burns in the secret fastness of the heart/ Blessed is the heart with strength to stop its beating for honor&#x27;s sake/ Blessed is the match that is consumed in kindling flame—Dedicated by his fellow members of Union Temple of Brooklyn December 9, 1949.&quot;

Ben-Gurion wrote to Marcus&#x27; wife Emma in Brooklyn: &quot;Marcus was the best man we had&quot;. On May 10, 1951, Ben-Gurion laid a wreath at the Marcus grave, accompanied by Emma Marcus. In January 2015 Israel&#x27;s President, Reuven Rivlin, visited the United States Military Academy at West Point and spoke at Marcus&#x27; grave: 

:&quot;For me, he was the first general of the IDF in every sense of the word. He had a sense of purpose and mission, in the establishment of the Israel Defense Forces, he taught us how to act as an army in our early days, and was one of Ben-Gurion’s greatest military advisors. There is no one who better illustrates the strong bond between Israel and the United States.&quot;

Kibbutz Mishmar David and the neighborhood of Neve David in Tel Aviv as well as numerous streets are named after him. In New York City the Colonel David Marcus Memorial Playground (in Brooklyn, on the north side of Avenue P between East 4th Street and Ocean Parkway) is also named for him, as was the David Marcus movie theater on Jerome Avenue in the Norwood section of the Bronx.

<text>The black-crested bulbul (Rubigula flaviventris) is a member of the bulbul family of passerine birds. It is found from the Indian subcontinent to southeast Asia.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The black-crested bulbul was originally described in the genus &quot;Vanga&quot; and later moved to the genus &quot;Pycnonotus&quot;. &quot;Pycnonotus&quot; was found to be polyphyletic in recent molecular phylogenetic studies and five bulbuls, including the black-crested bulbul, were moved to &quot;Rubigula&quot;.

Until 2008, the black-crested bulbul was considered as conspecific with the black-capped, ruby-throated, flame-throated and Bornean bulbuls, but these are all now treated as distinct.

===Subspecies===
Eight subspecies are accepted:
* &quot;R. f. flaviventris&quot; – : Found from Nepal, northern and eastern India (including Pachmarhi in central India) to southern China and central Myanmar 
* &quot;R. f. vantynei&quot; – : Found from eastern and southern Myanmar to southern China and northern Indochina
* &quot;R. f. xanthops&quot; – : Found in south-eastern Myanmar and western Thailand
* &quot;R. f. auratus&quot; – : Found in north-eastern Thailand and western Laos
* &quot;R. f. johnsoni&quot; – : Originally described as a separate species. Found in central and eastern Thailand, southern Indochina
* &quot;R. f. elbeli&quot; – : Found on islands off eastern coast of Thailand
* &quot;R. f. negata&quot; – : Found in southern Myanmar and south-western Thailand
* &quot;R. f. caecilii&quot; – : Found on the northern Malay Peninsula

==Description==
The black-crested bulbul is 18.5–19.5 cm in length. The head is black with a distinct crest and a yellow iris, while the rest of its body is greenish yellow above and yellow below, and a greenish-black tail. The bill and the feet are black. In the subspecies &quot;R. f. johnsoni&quot;, the throat is red. Both the male and female are similar in plumage; young birds are slightly duller.

==Distribution and habitat==
This is a bird of forest and dense scrub.

==Behaviour and ecology==
It builds its nest in a bush; two to four eggs are a typical clutch. The black-crested bulbul feeds on fruit and insects.

<doc id="624351" wikidata="Q3058998" url="?curid=624351" title="Esthero">
<text>Esthero ( ; born Jenny-Bea Englishman on December 23, 1978 in Stratford, Ontario) is a Canadian singer-songwriter who lives in Los Angeles, California. The name &quot;Esthero&quot; refers both to the singer and formerly to the two-person team of herself and producer Doc McKinney. Esthero is a portmanteau of &quot;Esther the hero&quot;; she claims to have gotten the name by combining the name of the heroine (Esther) and last line (&quot;If I am to be the hero, then I cannot fly from darkness&quot;) of the film from Sylvia Plath&#x27;s novel &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;.

Esthero&#x27;s sound characteristically features her voice over a mix of mellow bass lines, jazzy trumpets, Spanish guitar and hip-hop. She is sometimes compared to artists Björk, Portishead, Billie Holiday, and Sade. She has co-produced the majority of the material she performed. Later female artists who count Esthero among their influences include Res, Fergie and fellow Canadian Nelly Furtado.

Esthero&#x27;s brother, Jason Englishman, is also a musician.

==Career==

===Early life===
At the age of sixteen, Esthero moved from the small town of Walkerton, Ontario on her own to Toronto, Ontario, where she began singing at open-mic nights while supporting herself by working at different jobs. She was seen singing at the Free Times Cafe by manager Beau Ovcaric who set up a showcase for his partner Zack Werner. They introduced her to EMI Publishing Canada president Michael McCarty, whom she charmed so well during their first meeting that without hearing her sing a single note he set up and paid for recording sessions with Martin &quot;Doc&quot; McKinney, a guitarist and studio engineer.

===1997: &quot;Breath from Another&quot;===
The young duo quickly began recording together, and six demos in were being courted on the presidency level by almost every major label in the US. Thanks to then EMI publishing US president Rick Krim their demo&#x27;s reached the ears of the heads of the Work Group (a subsidiary of Sony). Their debut album, &quot;Breath from Another&quot;, was released to critical acclaim in Spring 1998.

===1998–2003: Collaborations and success===
Following the dissolution of the WORK label, Esthero was released from her contract. She signed with Reprise in 2000. In 1998, after a remix of one of her songs (&quot;Country Livin&#x27;&quot;) was used included on the soundtrack for &quot;Slam&quot;, Esthero received attention from many hip-hop and rap artists, with many requesting collaborations with her. Some such collaborations were fruitful, such as her work with the Black Eyed Peas on &quot;Weekends&quot;, which was an international hit.

In 2001, Esthero collaborated with German producer Ian Pooley on &quot;Balmes (A Better Life)&quot;, which reached the Top 75 of the UK Singles chart and gave Esthero her first entry on the US Dance charts.

===2004–2005: &quot;O.G. Bitch&quot; and &quot;Wikked Lil Grrrls&quot;===
On April 20, 2004—without Doc&#x27;s assistance—Esthero released &quot;O.G. Bitch&quot;, a standalone EP featuring six alternate remixes of the title track, plus the B-side &quot;I Love You&quot;. The song topped the club charts in the US. The following year, she released a second EP, titled &quot;We R in Need of a Musical Revolution&quot;. The EP spawned a hit of the same name and led the way to Esthero&#x27;s 2005 full-length album on the Warner Bros. label, &quot;Wikked Lil&#x27; Grrrls&quot;, seven years following her debut album, to mixed critical reaction. The album features contributions from Sean Lennon, André 3000, Jemeni, Jelleestone, and Cee-Lo Green of Goodie Mob.

===2007–2011: Split from record company and collaborations===
In 2007, Esthero amicably parted ways with Venus Management. She continues to have a familial bond with Zack and Beau. Esthero is currently self managed.

2008 was an eventful year for Esthero, with a number of high-profile collaborations including the viral sensation &quot;Yes We Can&quot;, a song (with accompanying video) inspired by a speech delivered by Barack Obama and produced by will.i.am. Esthero also provided the voice of the spaceship J.A.N.E. on Kanye West&#x27;s Glow in the Dark tour and appeared on his album &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot;, on which she co-wrote three tracks under her real name. 2008 also saw her take on the role of producer for a track from Dangerous Muse&#x27;s debut album and a co-writer on Brandy&#x27;s album &quot;Human&quot;. She is featured on hip hop music producer Timbaland&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Shock Value II&quot; on the songs &quot;Can You Feel It&quot; and &quot;Undertow&quot; with band The Fray. The latter entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 100, giving Esthero her first and only Hot 100 entry in the US.

===2012–present: &quot;Everything Is Expensive&quot; and &quot;Baby Steps&quot;===
On June 5, 2012, Esthero released a new single titled &quot;Never Gonna Let You Go&quot;, which was co-written and co-produced with Adam Bravin (She Wants Revenge). The song was featured in the February 21, 2013 episode of the ABC medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, titled &quot;This Is Why We Fight&quot;. The song reached number 72 on the Canadian Hot 100, giving Esthero her first entry on the chart.

On October 30, 2012, Esthero self-released a new album titled &quot;Everything Is Expensive&quot;. It debuted at number thirteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart in the US. In Canada, the album was released through Universal Music.

In 2016, &quot;Breath from Another&quot; was nominated for a Polaris Heritage Prize, for best album from 1996 to 2005. The album lost, however, to Arcade Fire&#x27;s &quot;Funeral&quot; (which won the public vote) and Lhasa de Sela&#x27;s &quot;La Llorona&quot; (which won the jury vote).

In 2019, Esthero was featured in Black Eyed Peas song &quot;4ever&quot;, and was in the accompanying music video which was published on February 1, 2019. Via social media, Esthero announced the song &quot;Baby Steps&quot; on February 3, 2019.

==Chart history==
Esthero&#x27;s singles typically perform well in North America. She has had three songs enter the US Dance Club Songs chart (&quot;Balmes&quot;, with Ian Pooley; &quot;O.G. Bitch&quot;; and &quot;Fastlane&quot;, with Jemeni &amp; Jelleestone); two of the songs reached the top five of the chart and one, &quot;O.G. Bitch&quot;, reached number one. She has also had two entries on the US Dance Singles Sales chart (&quot;O.G. Bitch&quot; and &quot;Fastlane&quot;), both of which reached the top ten. She has had one chart entry in the UK (&quot;Balmes&quot;, which broke the Top 75), and one chart entry in her native Canada (&quot;Never Gonna Let You Go&quot;, which reached number 72 on their Hot 100 chart).

==Appearances on television and soundtracks==
Esthero has appeared on the &quot;Chris Rock Show&quot;, &quot;Video on Trial&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, as well as &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and &quot;Farmclub&quot; with The Black Eyed Peas. She has also contributed songs to the films &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, &quot;Go&quot;, &quot;Bounce&quot;, &quot;Zero Effect&quot;, &quot;I Think I Love My Wife&quot; and &quot;Down With Love&quot;, as well as the video game &quot;007: Nightfire&quot;. Collaborations in which she has participated have appeared in &quot;Love &amp; Basketball&quot; and &quot;Slam&quot;.

Her song &quot;Wikked Lil&#x27; Grrrls&quot; has also appeared in the film &quot;Miss Congeniality 2&quot; and in commercial spots for &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, on the TV show &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, and also on the TV show &quot;Las Vegas&quot; and its soundtrack, and the film &quot;John Tucker Must Die&quot;.

The song &quot;Black Mermaid,&quot; features prominently in the 2018 film &quot;Nappily Ever After,&quot; a romantic comedy starring Sanaa Lathan, in which Lathan&#x27;s character sings a verse from the song (at approximately the 55-minute mark), with Esthero&#x27;s recording appearing in the following scene. The end credits state that &quot;Esthero appears courtesy of her beautiful mother and her own damn self.&quot;

<text>William Calvin Oates (either November 30 or December 1, 1835September 9, 1910) was a colonel in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, the 29th Governor of Alabama from 1894 to 1896, and a brigadier general in the U.S. Army during the Spanish–American War.

==Early life==
Oates was born in Pike County, Alabama, to William and Sarah (Sellers) Oates, a poor farming family. All of his ancestors came to North America during the colonial era, and all of them came from the two countries of England and Wales. At the age of 17, he believed that he had killed a man in a violent brawl and left home for Florida. Oates became a drifter, settling in Texas for a couple of years before returning to Alabama at the urging of his younger brother John, who the family had dispatched to locate him. He studied law at the Lawrenceville Academy in Lawrenceville and passed the bar examination, and then opened a practice in Abbeville.

==Civil War==

William C. Oates joined the Confederate States Army in July 1861 and entered the army as captain, 15th Alabama Infantry Regiment, and eventually became the commander of the 15th Alabama Infantry Regiment in the spring of 1863. He fought in the Battle of Gettysburg, leading his troops in a series of charges on Little Round Top, where his brother John was killed. Oates believed that if his regiment had been able to take Little Round Top, the Army of Northern Virginia might have won the battle and marched on to take Washington, D.C. Oates later stated that if even a single additional Confederate regiment had joined the assault, the attack could have succeeded, turning the U.S. flank and threatening the entire Army of the Potomac.

Oates stated:

Oates later participated in the battles of Chickamauga, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, and Cold Harbor. After losing command of his colonelcy of the 15th Alabama because of a political move, he was made colonel of the 48th Alabama by Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Oates was wounded during the Battle of Fussell&#x27;s Mill on the outskirts of Richmond, losing his right arm, which ended his active service.
==Postbellum career==
Oates resumed his law practice in Henry County, Alabama, and served as a delegate to the 1868 Democratic National Convention. From 1870 to 1872, he was a member of the Alabama House of Representatives. In 1880, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving seven consecutive terms. Oates married Sarah Toney of Eufaula on March 28, 1882, and they had one son, William Calvin, Jr., who eventually joined his father in the law practice.

Oates was elected governor of Alabama in 1894 in a bitter campaign. Two years later, he unsuccessfully tried to secure his party&#x27;s nomination as a candidate for the United States Senate. President William McKinley commissioned Oates as a brigadier general in 1898, and he served in the Spanish–American War. He returned to his law practice and speculated in real estate. He tried unsuccessfully to have a monument erected at Gettysburg to his comrades in the old 15th Alabama, including his fallen brother.

Oates died in Montgomery, and was buried in Oakwood Cemetery.

<doc id="624361" wikidata="Q288322" url="?curid=624361" title="Autophagy">
<text>Autophagy (or autophagocytosis; from the Greek , , meaning &quot;self-devouring&quot; and , , meaning &quot;hollow&quot;) is the natural, conserved degradation of the cell that removes unnecessary or dysfunctional components through a lysosome-dependent regulated mechanism. It allows the orderly degradation and recycling of cellular components. Although initially characterized as a primordial degradation pathway induced to protect against starvation, it has become increasingly clear that autophagy also plays a major role in the homeostasis of non-starved cells. Defects in autophagy have been linked to various human diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer, and interest in modulating autophagy as a potential treatment for these diseases has grown rapidly.

Four forms of autophagy have been identified: macroautophagy, microautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and crinophagy. In macroautophagy (the most thoroughly researched form of autophagy), cytoplasmic components (like mitochondria) are targeted and isolated from the rest of the cell within a double-membrane vesicle known as an autophagosome, which, in time, fuses with an available lysosome, bringing its specialty process of waste management and disposal; and eventually the contents of the vesicle (now called an autolysosome) are degraded and recycled. In crinophagy (the least well-known and researched form of autophagy), unnecessary secretory granules are degraded and recycled.

In disease, autophagy has been seen as an adaptive response to stress, promoting survival of the cell; but in other cases, it appears to promote cell death and morbidity. In the extreme case of starvation, the breakdown of cellular components promotes cellular survival by maintaining cellular energy levels.

The word &quot;autophagy&quot; was in existence and frequently used from the middle of the 19th century. In its present usage, the term autophagy was coined by Belgian biochemist Christian de Duve in 1963 based on his discovery of the functions of lysosome. The identification of autophagy-related genes in yeast in the 1990s allowed researchers to deduce the mechanisms of autophagy, which eventually led to the award of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Japanese researcher Yoshinori Ohsumi.

==History==
Autophagy was first observed by Keith R. Porter and his student Thomas Ashford at the Rockefeller Institute. In January 1962 they reported an increased number of lysosomes in rat liver cells after the addition of glucagon, and that some displaced lysosomes towards the centre of the cell contained other cell organelles such as mitochondria. They called this autolysis after Christian de Duve and Alex B. Novikoff. However Porter and Ashford wrongly interpreted their data as lysosome formation (ignoring the pre-existing organelles). Lysosomes could not be cell organelles, but part of cytoplasm such as mitochondria, and that hydrolytic enzymes were produced by microbodies. In 1963 Hruban, Spargo and colleagues published a detailed ultrastructural description of &quot;focal cytoplasmic degradation&quot;, which referenced a 1955 German study of injury-induced sequestration. Hruban, Spargo and colleagues recognized three continuous stages of maturation of the sequestered cytoplasm to lysosomes, and that the process was not limited to injury states that functioned under physiological conditions for &quot;reutilization of cellular materials&quot;, and the &quot;disposal of organelles&quot; during differentiation. Inspired by this discovery, de Duve christened the phenomena &quot;autophagy&quot;. Unlike Porter and Ashford, de Duve conceived the term as a part of lysosomal function while describing the role of glucagon as a major inducer of cell degradation in the liver. With his student Russell Deter, he established that lysosomes are responsible for glucagon-induced autophagy. This was the first time the fact that lysosomes are the sites of intracellular autophagy was established.

In the 1990s several groups of scientists independently discovered autophagy-related genes using the budding yeast. Notably, Yoshinori Ohsumi and Michael Thumm examined starvation-induced non-selective autophagy; in the meantime, Daniel J. Klionsky discovered the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (CVT) pathway, which is a form of selective autophagy. They soon found that they were in fact looking at essentially the same pathway, just from different angles. Initially, the genes discovered by these and other yeast groups were given different names (APG, AUT, CVT, GSA, PAG, PAZ, and PDD). A unified nomenclature was advocated in 2003 by the yeast researchers to use ATG to denote autophagy genes. The 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Yoshinori Ohsumi, although some have pointed out that if there is only one recipient of the award, it must be Ohsumi, but that the award could have been more inclusive.

The field of autophagy research experienced accelerated growth at the turn of the 21st century. Knowledge of ATG genes provided scientists more convenient tools to dissect functions of autophagy in human health and disease. In 1999, a landmark discovery connecting autophagy with cancer was published by Beth Levine&#x27;s group. To this date, relationship between cancer and autophagy continues to be a main theme of autophagy research. The roles of autophagy in neurodegeneration and immune defense also received considerable attention. In 2003, the first Gordon Research Conference on autophagy was held at Waterville. In 2005, Daniel J Klionsky launched &quot;Autophagy&quot;, a scientific journal dedicated to this field. The first Keystone Symposia on autophagy was held in 2007 at Monterey. In 2008, Carol A Mercer created a BHMT fusion protein (GST-BHMT), which showed starvation-induced site-specific fragmentation in cell lines. The degradation of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), a metabolic enzyme, could be used to assess autophagy flux in mammalian cells.
Macro, micro, and Chaperone mediated autophagy are mediated by autophagy-related genes and their associated enzymes. Macroautophagy is then divided into bulk and selective autophagy. In the selective autophagy is the autophagy of organelles; mitophagy, lipophagy, pexophagy, chlorophagy, ribophagy and others.

Macroautophagy is the main pathway, used primarily to eradicate damaged cell organelles or unused proteins. First the phagophore engulfs the material that needs to be degraded, which forms a double membrane known as an autophagosome, around the organelle marked for destruction. The autophagosome then travels through the cytoplasm of the cell to a lysosome in mammals, or vacuoles in yeast and plants, and the two organelles fuse. Within the lysosome/vacuole, the contents of the autophagosome are degraded via acidic lysosomal hydrolase.

Microautophagy, on the other hand, involves the direct engulfment of cytoplasmic material into the lysosome. This occurs by invagination, meaning the inward folding of the lysosomal membrane, or cellular protrusion.

Chaperone-mediated autophagy, or CMA, is a very complex and specific pathway, which involves the recognition by the hsc70-containing complex. This means that a protein must contain the recognition site for this hsc70 complex which will allow it to bind to this chaperone, forming the CMA- substrate/chaperone complex. This complex then moves to the lysosomal membrane-bound protein that will recognise and bind with the CMA receptor. Upon recognition, the substrate protein gets unfolded and it is translocated across the lysosome membrane with the assistance of the lysosomal hsc70 chaperone. CMA is significantly different from other types of autophagy because it translocates protein material in a one by one manner, and it is extremely selective about what material crosses the lysosomal barrier.

Mitophagy is the selective degradation of mitochondria by autophagy. It often occurs to defective mitochondria following damage or stress. Mitophagy promotes the turnover of mitochondria and prevents the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria which can lead to cellular degeneration. It is mediated by Atg32 (in yeast) and NIX and its regulator BNIP3 in mammals. Mitophagy is regulated by PINK1 and parkin proteins. The occurrence of mitophagy is not limited to the damaged mitochondria but also involves undamaged ones.

Lipophagy is the degradation of lipids by autophagy, a function which has been shown to exist in both animal and fungal cells. The role of lipophagy in plant cells, however, remains elusive. In lipophagy the target are lipid structures called lipid droplets (LDs), spheric &quot;organelles&quot; with a core of mainly triacylglycerols (TAGs) and a unilayer of phospholipids and membrane proteins. In animal cells the main lipophagic pathway is via the engulfment of LDs by the phagophore, macroautophagy. In fungal cells on the other hand microplipophagy constitutes the main pathway and is especially well studied in the budding yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;. Lipophagy was first discovered in mice and published 2009.

== Targeted interplay between bacterial pathogens and host autophagy ==
Autophagy targets genus-specific proteins, so orthologous proteins which share sequence homology with each other are recognized as substrates by a particular autophagy targeting protein. There exists a complementarity of autophagy targeting proteins which potentially increase infection risk upon mutation. The lack of overlap among the targets of the 3 autophagy proteins and the large overlap in terms of the genera show that autophagy could target different sets of bacterial proteins from the same pathogen. On one hand, the redundancy in targeting the same genera is beneficial for robust pathogen recognition. But, on the other hand, the complementarity in the specific bacterial proteins could make the host more susceptible to chronic disorders and infections if the gene encoding one of the autophagy targeting proteins becomes mutated, and the autophagy system is overloaded or suffers other malfunctions. Moreover, autophagy targets virulence factors and virulence factors responsible for more general functions such as nutrient acquisition and motility are recognized by multiple autophagy targeting proteins. And the specialized virulence factors such as autolysins, and iron sequestering proteins are potentially recognized uniquely by a single autophagy targeting protein. The autophagy proteins CALCOCO2/NDP52 and MAP1LC3/LC3 may have evolved specifically to target pathogens or pathogenic proteins for autophagic degradation. While SQSTM1/p62 targets more generic bacterial proteins containing a target motif but not related to virulence.

On the other hand, bacterial proteins from various pathogenic genera are also able to modulate autophagy. There are genus-specific patterns in the phases of autophagy that are potentially regulated by a given pathogen group. Some autophagy phases can only be modulated by particular pathogens, while some phases are modulated by multiple pathogen genera. Some of the interplay-related bacterial proteins have proteolytic and post-translational activity such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination and can interfere with the activity of autophagy proteins.

==Molecular biology==
ATG is short for &quot;AuTophaGy&quot;-related, which is applied to both genes and proteins related to the biological process of autophagy. There are about 16-20 conserved &quot;ATG&quot; genes coding for many core ATG proteins conserved from yeast to humans. ATG may be part of the protein name (such as ATG7) or part of the gene name (such as &quot;ATG7&quot;), although all ATG proteins and genes do not follow this pattern (such as ULK1).

To give specific examples, the UKL1 enzyme (kinase complex) induces autophagosome biogenesis, and ATG13 (Autophagy-related protein 13) is required for phagosome formation.

Autophagy is executed by ATG genes. Prior to 2003, ten or more names were used, but after this point a unified nomenclature was devised by fungal autophagy researchers. The first autophagy genes were identified by genetic screens conducted in &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;. Following their identification those genes were functionally characterized and their orthologs in a variety of different organisms were identified and studied. Today, thirty-six Atg proteins have been classified as especially important for autophagy, of which 18 belong to the core machinery.

In mammals, amino acid sensing and additional signals such as growth factors and reactive oxygen species regulate the activity of the protein kinases mTOR and AMPK. These two kinases regulate autophagy through inhibitory phosphorylation of the Unc-51-like kinases ULK1 and ULK2 (mammalian homologues of Atg1). Induction of autophagy results in the dephosphorylation and activation of the ULK kinases. ULK is part of a protein complex containing Atg13, Atg101 and FIP200. ULK phosphorylates and activates Beclin-1 (mammalian homologue of Atg6), which is also part of a protein complex. The autophagy-inducible Beclin-1 complex contains the proteins PIK3R4(p150), Atg14L and the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase (PI(3)K) Vps34. The active ULK and Beclin-1 complexes re-localize to the site of autophagosome initiation, the phagophore, where they both contribute to the activation of downstream autophagy components.

Once active, VPS34 phosphorylates the lipid phosphatidylinositol to generate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) on the surface of the phagophore. The generated PtdIns(3)P is used as a docking point for proteins harboring a PtdIns(3)P binding motif. WIPI2, a PtdIns(3)P binding protein of the WIPI (WD-repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositides) protein family, was recently shown to physically bind ATG16L1. Atg16L1 is a member of an E3-like protein complex involved in one of two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems essential for autophagosome formation. The FIP200 cis-Golgi-derived membranes fuse with ATG16L1-positive endosomal membranes to form the prophagophore termed HyPAS (hybrid pre-autophagosomal structure). ATG16L1 binding to WIPI2 mediates ATG16L1&#x27;s activity. This leads to downstream conversion of prophagophore into ATG8-positive phagophore via a ubiquitin-like conjugation system.

The first of the two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems involved in autophagy covalently binds the ubiquitin-like protein Atg12 to Atg5. The resulting conjugate protein then binds ATG16L1 to form an E3-like complex which functions as part of the second ubiquitin-like conjugation system. This complex binds and activates Atg3, which covalently attaches mammalian homologues of the ubiquitin-like yeast protein ATG8 (LC3A-C, GATE16, and GABARAPL1-3), the most studied being LC3 proteins, to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) on the surface of autophagosomes. Lipidated LC3 contributes to the closure of autophagosomes, and enables the docking of specific cargos and adaptor proteins such as Sequestosome-1/p62. The completed autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome through the actions of multiple proteins, including SNAREs and UVRAG. Following the fusion LC3 is retained on the vesicle&#x27;s inner side and degraded along with the cargo, while the LC3 molecules attached to the outer side are cleaved off by Atg4 and recycled. The contents of the autolysosome are subsequently degraded and their building blocks are released from the vesicle through the action of permeases.

Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) stimulates autophagy by preventing acetylation of proteins (via deacetylation) required for autophagy as demonstrated in cultured cells and embryonic and neonatal tissues. This function provides a link between sirtuin expression and the cellular response to limited nutrients due to caloric restriction.

== Functions ==

=== Nutrient starvation ===
Autophagy has roles in various cellular functions. One particular example is in yeasts, where the nutrient starvation induces a high level of autophagy. This allows unneeded proteins to be degraded and the amino acids recycled for the synthesis of proteins that are essential for survival. In higher eukaryotes, autophagy is induced in response to the nutrient depletion that occurs in animals at birth after severing off the trans-placental food supply, as well as that of nutrient starved cultured cells and tissues. Mutant yeast cells that have a reduced autophagic capability rapidly perish in nutrition-deficient conditions. Studies on the &quot;apg&quot; mutants suggest that autophagy via autophagic bodies is indispensable for protein degradation in the vacuoles under starvation conditions, and that at least 15 APG genes are involved in autophagy in yeast. A gene known as ATG7 has been implicated in nutrient-mediated autophagy, as mice studies have shown that starvation-induced autophagy was impaired in &quot;atg7&quot;-deficient mice.

=== Infection ===
Vesicular stomatitis virus is believed to be taken up by the autophagosome from the cytosol and translocated to the endosomes where detection takes place by a pattern recognition receptor called toll-like receptor 7, detecting single stranded RNA. Following activation of the toll-like receptor, intracellular signaling cascades are initiated, leading to induction of interferon and other antiviral cytokines. A subset of viruses and bacteria subvert the autophagic pathway to promote their own replication. Galectin-8 has recently been identified as an intracellular &quot;danger receptor&quot;, able to initiate autophagy against intracellular pathogens. When galectin-8 binds to a damaged vacuole, it recruits an autophagy adaptor such as NDP52 leading to the formation of an autophagosome and bacterial degradation.

=== Repair mechanism ===
Autophagy degrades damaged organelles, cell membranes and proteins, and insufficient autophagy is thought to be one of the main reasons for the accumulation of damaged cells and aging. Autophagy and autophagy regulators are involved in response to lysosomal damage, often directed by galectins such as galectin-3 and galectin-8.

Repair of damaged DNA involves the recruitment of enzymes to the damaged site, but these enzymes must be removed upon completion of the repair process. Topoisomerase I cleavage complex is employed in the processing of DNA damages (e.g. DNA-protein crosslinks) in vertebrates, and this complex is selectively degraded by autophagy, presumably after it is no longer needed.

=== Programmed cell death ===
One of the mechanisms of programmed cell death (PCD) is associated with the appearance of autophagosomes and depends on autophagy proteins. This form of cell death most likely corresponds to a process that has been morphologically defined as autophagic PCD. One question that constantly arises, however, is whether autophagic activity in dying cells is the cause of death or is actually an attempt to prevent it. Morphological and histochemical studies have not so far proved a causative relationship between the autophagic process and cell death. In fact, there have recently been strong arguments that autophagic activity in dying cells might actually be a survival mechanism. Studies of the metamorphosis of insects have shown cells undergoing a form of PCD that appears distinct from other forms; these have been proposed as examples of autophagic cell death. Recent pharmacological and biochemical studies have proposed that survival and lethal autophagy can be distinguished by the type and degree of regulatory signaling during stress particularly after viral infection. Although promising, these findings have not been examined in non-viral systems.

===Meiosis===
Mammalian fetal oocytes face several challenges to survival throughout the stages of meiotic prophase I prior to primordial follicle assembly. Each primordial follicle contains an immature primary oocyte. Before oocytes are enclosed into a primordial follicle, deficiencies of nutrients or growth factors might activate protective autophagy, but this can turn into death of the oocytes if starvation is prolonged.

==Exercise==
Autophagy is essential for basal homeostasis; it is also extremely important in maintaining muscle homeostasis during physical exercise. Autophagy at the molecular level is only partially understood. A study of mice shows that autophagy is important for the ever-changing demands of their nutritional and energy needs, particularly through the metabolic pathways of protein catabolism. In a 2012 study conducted by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, mutant mice (with a knock-in mutation of BCL2 phosphorylation sites to produce progeny that showed normal levels of basal autophagy yet were deficient in stress-induced autophagy) were tested to challenge this theory. Results showed that when compared to a control group, these mice illustrated a decrease in endurance and an altered glucose metabolism during acute exercise.

Another study demonstrated that skeletal muscle fibers of collagen VI in knockout mice showed signs of degeneration due to an insufficiency of autophagy which led to an accumulation of damaged mitochondria and excessive cell death. Exercise-induced autophagy was unsuccessful however; but when autophagy was induced artificially post-exercise, the accumulation of damaged organelles in collagen VI deficient muscle fibres was prevented and cellular homeostasis was maintained. Both studies demonstrate that autophagy induction may contribute to the beneficial metabolic effects of exercise and that it is essential in the maintaining of muscle homeostasis during exercise, particularly in collagen VI fibers.

Work at the Institute for Cell Biology, University of Bonn, showed that a certain type of autophagy, i.e. chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA), is induced in contracting muscles and is required for maintaining the muscle sarcomere under mechanical tension. The CASA chaperone complex recognizes mechanically damaged cytoskeleton components and directs these components through a ubiquitin-dependent autophagic sorting pathway to lysosomes for disposal. This is necessary for maintaining muscle activity.

==Osteoarthritis==

Because autophagy decreases with age and age is a major risk factor for osteoarthritis, the role of autophagy in the development of this disease is suggested. Proteins involved in autophagy are reduced with age in both human and mouse articular cartilage. Mechanical injury to cartilage explants in culture also reduced autophagy proteins. Autophagy is constantly activated in normal cartilage but it is compromised with age and precedes cartilage cell death and structural damage. Thus autophagy is involved in a normal protective process (chondroprotection) in the joint.

==Cancer==
Cancer often occurs when several different pathways that regulate cell differentiation are disturbed. Autophagy plays an important role in cancer – both in protecting against cancer as well as potentially contributing to the growth of cancer. Autophagy can contribute to cancer by promoting survival of tumor cells that have been starved, or that degrade apoptotic mediators through autophagy: in such cases, use of inhibitors of the late stages of autophagy (such as chloroquine), on the cells that use autophagy to survive, increases the number of cancer cells killed by antineoplastic drugs.

The role of autophagy in cancer is one that has been highly researched and reviewed. There is evidence that emphasizes the role of autophagy as both a tumor suppressor and a factor in tumor cell survival. Recent research has shown, however, that autophagy is more likely to be used as a tumor suppressor according to several models.

===Tumor suppressor===
Several experiments have been done with mice and varying Beclin1, a protein that regulates autophagy. When the Beclin1 gene was altered to be heterozygous (Beclin 1+/-), the mice were found to be tumor-prone. However, when Beclin1 was overexpressed, tumor development was inhibited. Care should be exercised when interpreting phenotypes of beclin mutants and attributing the observations to a defect in autophagy, however: Beclin1 is generally required for phosphatidylinositol 3- phosphate production and as such it affects numerous lysosomal and endosomal functions, including endocytosis and endocytic degradation of activated growth factor receptors. In support of the possibility that Beclin1 affects cancer development through an autophagy-independent pathway is the fact that core autophagy factors which are not known to affect other cellular processes and are definitely not known to affect cell proliferation and cell death, such as Atg7 or Atg5, show a much different phenotype when the respective gene is knocked out, which does not include tumor formation. In addition, full knockout of Beclin1 is embryonic lethal whereas knockout of Atg7 or Atg5 is not.

Necrosis and chronic inflammation also has been shown to be limited through autophagy which helps protect against the formation of tumor cells.

===Colorectal cancer===
Colorectal cancer incidence is associated with a high-fat diet, and such a diet is linked to elevated levels of bile acids in the colon, particularly deoxycholic acid. Deoxycholic acid induces autophagy in non-cancer colon epithelial cells and this induction of autophagy contributes to cell survival when cells are stressed. Also autophagy is a survival pathway that is constitutively present in apoptosis-resistant colon cancer cells. The constitutive activation of autophagy in colon cancer cells, is thus a colon cancer cell survival strategy that needs to be overcome in colon cancer therapy.

===Mechanism of cell death===
Cells that undergo an extreme amount of stress experience cell death either through apoptosis or necrosis. Prolonged autophagy activation leads to a high turnover rate of proteins and organelles. A high rate above the survival threshold may kill cancer cells with a high apoptotic threshold. This technique can be utilized as a therapeutic cancer treatment.

===Tumor cell survival===
Alternatively, autophagy has also been shown to play a large role in tumor cell survival. In cancerous cells, autophagy is used as a way to deal with stress on the cell. Induction of autophagy by miRNA-4673, for example, is a pro-survival mechanism that improves the resistance of cancer cells to radiation. Once these autophagy related genes were inhibited, cell death was potentiated. The increase in metabolic energy is offset by autophagy functions. These metabolic stresses include hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and an increase in proliferation. These stresses activate autophagy in order to recycle ATP and maintain survival of the cancerous cells. Autophagy has been shown to enable continued growth of tumor cells by maintaining cellular energy production. By inhibiting autophagy genes in these tumors cells, regression of the tumor and extended survival of the organs affected by the tumors were found. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy has also been shown to enhance the effectiveness of anticancer therapies.

===Therapeutic target===
New developments in research have found that targeted autophagy may be a viable therapeutic solution in fighting cancer. As discussed above, autophagy plays both a role in tumor suppression and tumor cell survival. Thus, the qualities of autophagy can be used as a strategy for cancer prevention. The first strategy is to induce autophagy and enhance its tumor suppression attributes. The second strategy is to inhibit autophagy and thus induce apoptosis.

The first strategy has been tested by looking at dose-response anti-tumor effects during autophagy-induced therapies. These therapies have shown that autophagy increases in a dose-dependent manner. This is directly related to the growth of cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner as well. These data support the development of therapies that will encourage autophagy. Secondly, inhibiting the protein pathways directly known to induce autophagy may also serve as an anticancer therapy.

The second strategy is based on the idea that autophagy is a protein degradation system used to maintain homeostasis and the findings that inhibition of autophagy often leads to apoptosis. Inhibition of autophagy is riskier as it may lead to cell survival instead of the desired cell death.

=== Negative regulators of autophagy ===
Negative regulators of autophagy, such as mTOR, cFLIP, EGFR, (GAPR-1), and Rubicon are orchestrated to function within different stages of the autophagy cascade. The end-products of autophagic digestion may also serve as a negative-feedback regulatory mechanism to stop prolonged activity.

==The interface between inflammation and autophagy==

Regulators of autophagy control regulators of inflammation, and vice versa.
Cells of vertebrate organisms normally activate inflammation to enhance the capacity of the immune system to clear infections and to initiate the processes that restore tissue structure and function. Therefore, it is critical to couple regulation of mechanisms for removal of cellular and bacterial debris to the principal factors that regulate inflammation: The degradation of cellular components by the lysosome during autophagy serves to recycle vital molecules and generate a pool of building blocks to help the cell respond to a changing microenvironment. Proteins that control inflammation and autophagy form a network that is critical for tissue functions, which is dysregulated in cancer:
In cancer cells, aberrantly expressed and mutant proteins increase the dependence of cell survival on the &quot;rewired&quot; network of proteolytic systems that protects malignant cells from apoptotic proteins and from recognition by the immune system. This renders cancer cells vulnerable to intervention on regulators of autophagy.

==Type 2 diabetes==
Excessive activity of the crinophagy form of autophagy in the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas could reduce the quantity of insulin available for secretion, leading to type 2 diabetes.

<text>Robert Guillaume (born Robert Peter Williams; November 30, 1927 – October 24, 2017) was an American actor and singer. He played Benson DuBois in the ABC television series &quot;Soap&quot; and its spin-off, &quot;Benson&quot;. He also voiced the mandrill Rafiki in &quot;The Lion King&quot;, and played Isaac Jaffe in Aaron Sorkin&#x27;s dramedy &quot;Sports Night&quot;.

In a career that spanned more than 50 years, Guillaume worked extensively on stage, television and film. He was nominated for a Tony Award for his portrayal of Nathan Detroit in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, and twice won an Emmy Award for his portrayal of the character Benson DuBois, once in 1979 on &quot;Soap&quot; and again in 1985 on &quot;Benson&quot;. He also won a Grammy Award in 1995 for his spoken-word performance of an audiobook version of &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Guillaume was the first African-American actor to portray the title role in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;.

==Early life==
Guillaume was born Robert Peter Williams in St. Louis to an alcoholic mother. After she abandoned him and several siblings, they were raised by their grandmother, Jeannette Williams. He studied at Saint Louis University and Washington University in St. Louis and served in the U.S. Army before pursuing an acting career. He adopted the surname Guillaume (French for William) as his stage name.

==Career==
===Stage===

After college, Guillaume joined the Karamu Players in Cleveland and performed in musical comedies and opera. He toured the world in 1959 as a cast member of the Broadway musical &quot;Free and Easy&quot;. He made his Broadway debut in &quot;Kwamina&quot; in 1961. His other stage appearances included &quot;Golden Boy&quot; (with Sammy Davis Jr.), &quot;Tambourines to Glory&quot;, &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, for which he received a Tony Award nomination, &quot;Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris&quot;, and &quot;Purlie.&quot; His additional roles included Katherine Dunham&#x27;s &quot;Bambouche&quot; and in &quot;Fly The Blackbird&quot;.

In 1964, Guillaume portrayed Sportin&#x27; Life in a revival of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; at New York City Center. Guillaume was a member of the Robert De Cormier Singers, performing in concerts and on television. He recorded an LP album, Columbia CS9033, titled &quot;Just Arrived&quot;, as a member of The Pilgrims, a folk trio, with Angeline Butler and Millard Williams. Columbia records producer Tom Wilson had set out to create the Pilgrims as an answer to the popular folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary. By early 1964, the Pilgrims had recorded a handful of songs and Wilson was looking for the right song for the group&#x27;s debut single when a then-unknown singer/songwriter named Paul Simon arrived for a meeting with Wilson and eventually pitched his new composition, &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;. Wilson liked the song and had Simon record a demo for the group, but when Simon and his friend, Art Garfunkel, sang the song for Wilson in person, he signed them to a record contract instead of using it for The Pilgrims.

In 1976, Guillaume played Nathan Detroit in the Broadway revival of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; and was nominated for a Tony Award.

In 1990, Guillaume was cast in the Los Angeles production of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, replacing Michael Crawford in the title role. Guillaume was the first Black actor to portray the character.

Guillaume made several guest appearances on sitcoms, including &quot;Good Times&quot;, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, &quot;Saved by the Bell: The College Years&quot; and in the 1990s sitcoms &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; and &quot;A Different World&quot;. Guillaume also played Dr. Franklin in season 6, episode 6 (&quot;Chain Letter&quot;) of the series &quot;All in the Family&quot;, in which he coyly referenced &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, a TV series in which he had guest-starred in 1970.

His series-regular debut was on the ABC series &quot;Soap&quot;, playing Benson, a butler, from 1977 to 1979. Guillaume continued the role in a spin-off series, &quot;Benson&quot;, which ran for 158 episodes from 1979 until 1986.

In 1985, Guillaume appeared in the television mini-series &quot;North and South&quot; as abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass, who escaped from slavery and became a leader of the anti-slavery movement prior to the American Civil War.

He also appeared as marriage counselor Edward Sawyer on &quot;The Robert Guillaume Show&quot; (1989), Detective Bob Ballard on &quot;Pacific Station&quot; (1991–1992), and television executive Isaac Jaffe on Aaron Sorkin&#x27;s short-lived but critically acclaimed &quot;Sports Night&quot; (1998–2000). Guillaume suffered a mild stroke on January 14, 1999, while filming an episode of the latter series. He recovered and his character was later also depicted as having had a stroke. He also made a guest appearance on &quot;8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter&quot;. He made one of his final TV appearances during season 5 on &quot;&quot;

His voice was employed for characters in television series &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot;, &quot;Fish Police&quot;, and &quot;Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child&quot;. He was known for the voice of Rafiki in the movie &quot;The Lion King&quot; and its sequels and spin-offs. He lent his deep tenor voice as Mr. Thicknose in &quot;The Land Before Time VIII: The Big Freeze&quot;. He also supplied the voice for Eli Vance in the 2004 video game &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; and its immediate episodic sequels.

The stroke was minor, causing relatively slight damage and little effect on his speech. After six weeks in the hospital, he underwent therapy consisting of walks and gym sessions.

<doc id="624367" wikidata="Q1117432" url="?curid=624367" title="Minnesota Legislature">
<text>The Minnesota Legislature is the bicameral legislature of the U.S. state of Minnesota consisting of two houses: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Senators are elected from 67 single-member districts. In order to account for decennial redistricting, members run for one two-year term and two four-year terms each decade. They are elected for four-year terms in years ending in 2 and 6, and for two-year terms in years ending in 0. Representatives are elected for two-year terms from 134 single-member districts formed by dividing the 67 senate districts in half (ie. Senate District 1 Contains House Districts 1A and 1B).

Both houses of the legislature meet between January and the first Monday following the third Saturday in May each year, not to exceed 120 legislative days per biennium. Floor sessions are held in the Minnesota State Capitol in Saint Paul.

==History==

===City charters===
Early on in Minnesota&#x27;s history, the legislature had direct control over the city charters that set the groundwork for governments in municipalities across the state. In the early period, many laws were written for specific cities. The practice was outlawed in 1881, though attempts were still made. For instance, the long-standing Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board and the city&#x27;s now defunct Library Board were both created by the legislature in the next several years. The Minnesota Constitution was amended in 1896 to give cities direct control over their own charters.

===Early female legislators===
Following the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920, women began to be elected to the Minnesota Legislature. In 1922, Mabeth Hurd Paige, Hannah Kempfer, Sue Metzger Dickey Hough and Myrtle Cain were elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives.

In 1984, the legislature ordered that all gender-specific pronouns be removed from the state laws. After two years of work, the rewritten laws were adopted. Only 301 of 20,000 pronouns were feminine. &quot;His&quot; was changed 10,000 times and &quot;he&quot; was changed 6,000 times.

===The non-partisan era===
In 1913, Minnesota legislators began to be elected on nonpartisan ballots. This was a historical accident that occurred when a bill to provide for no-party elections of judges, city, and county officers was amended to include the legislature in the belief that it would kill the bill. While Minnesota legislators were elected on a nonpartisan ballot, they caucused as &quot;Liberals&quot; or &quot;Conservatives,&quot; roughly the equivalent in most years to Democratic or Farmer–Labor (later Democratic–Farmer–Labor) and Republican, respectively. In 1974, House members again ran with party designation. In 1976, Senate members again ran with party designation.

===2004===
Governor Jesse Ventura advocated the idea of changing the legislature to be unicameral while he was in office, but the concept did not obtain widespread support.

In 2004, the legislature ended its regular session without acting on a majority of the planned legislation, largely due to political divisiveness on a variety of issues ranging from education to same-sex marriage (See same-sex marriage in the United States for related events during the year). A proper budget failed to pass, and major anticipated projects such as the Northstar Corridor commuter rail line were not approved. Governor Tim Pawlenty, an opponent turned advocate of the line, was expected to request a special session but ended up helping the coordination of other funds to continue the development of the line. The lack of action in the 2004 session is said to be one reason why a number of Republican House members lost their seats in the November election. The Democratic–Farmer–Labor (DFL) minority grew from 53 to 66 and the Republican majority was reduced from 81 to 68.

The Senate was not up for election in 2004 so the DFL was able to maintain its five-seat majority in the upper house. One state senator, Sheila Kiscaden of Rochester, was an Independence Party member until December 2005 when she began caucusing with the DFL, although she had been an elected Republican in the past. The DFL majority increased to six senators when Kiscaden announced her re-affiliation with the DFL in preparation to run for lieutenant governor on a ticket with DFLer Kelly Doran.

===2005 shutdown===

There is a mandatory adjournment date specified in the state constitution: &quot;The legislature shall not meet in regular session, nor in any adjournment thereof, after the first Monday following the third Saturday in May of any year.&quot; In 2005, the regular session ended without passage of an overall budget and a special session was subsequently called by Governor Pawlenty. No overall budget passed by the end of the fiscal year on June 30, and much of the government shut down for the first time in the state&#x27;s history. However, some essential services remained in operation and some departments received funding in legislation. A compromise budget was approved and signed into law two weeks later.

===2011 shutdown===
===Recent history===
The November 2022 general election saw the DFL maintain the governorship and the state House, while regaining control of the state Senate. This produced the first DFL legislative trifecta since 2014.

In the 2024 election, the Minnesota House was tied with 67 members elected from each major party. After the election of Curtis Johnson was nullified due to a residency challenge, the 2025 session began with a stalemate in the House. For three weeks, the DFL boycotted the session, denying quorum until a power-sharing agreement was reached.
==Television broadcasts==
When the legislature is in session, proceedings of both houses are broadcast on television via the Minnesota Channel and also online via the legislature&#x27;s website. The Minnesota House YouTube channel is “MNHouseInfo.” The Minnesota Senate YouTube Channel is “Minnesota Senate Media Services.”

<text>Kruszwica () is a town in central Poland, in the Inowrocław County in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. It has a population of 9,161 (2010). Initially founded in the 6th century, Kruszwica is the oldest town in the region and features a medieval castle with a 12th-century Romanesque church. It is situated on the shores of Gopło Lake in the historic region of Kuyavia.

==History==

&quot;This article incorporates text from &quot;The Political History of Poland&quot; (1917) by Edward Henry Lewinski-Corwin, a publication now in the public domain.&quot;

Owing to the frequent raids of the Norsemen, the people of this region early organized an effective military force of defense. Under the protection of the military bands and their chiefs, the fields could safely be cultivated and the little, fortified towns (grody), which became places for the transaction of intertribal business and barter, for common worship, and for the storage of goods during a foreign invasion could be successfully defended and the wrongs of the people redressed. The military bands and their leaders soon became the unifying force, and the fortified towns, the centers of a larger political organization, with the freeman (Kmiec or Kmeton) as its base.

The first historical town of this nature was that of Kruszwica, on the Lake of Gopło. Kruszwica formed part of Poland since its establishment in the 10th century.

Some historical writers attribute the change in the political organization of the primitive Polanie tribe to the influence of foreign commerce, which for geographic reasons had early centered on the Gopło. At that period the lake was a very large body of water with a level at least ten feet higher than at present. The many small lakes now existing in the region were in all probability a part of Gopło, and the valleys of the vicinity constituted the bottom of the lake. There are many reasons to believe that such was the hydrography of the section in that remote age. In his description of Gopło, written five hundred years ago, Jan Długosz, a Polish historian, speaks of a vast body of water, leading us to believe that the lake then was much larger than it is at the present time. There is reason to believe that five hundred years previous to this historian&#x27;s time, before the primeval forests were cut, the lake was still larger. The supposition that Gopło at the time of its highest level was connected by means of small navigable streams with the rivers Warta, Oder and the Vistula is quite plausible.

The constructive fancy of the economic historian sees flotillas of Pomeranian merchants moving to and from Szczecin down the Oder and Noteć. Here they met merchants from the east, the southeast and the southwest of Europe. The Byzantine, Roman and Scandinavian cultures met at Kruszwica, the largest town on the banks of this vast internal sea of Poland, and exercised a revolutionary effect upon the modes of thought and the political institutions of the tribe. Otherwise the sudden transformation which took place from the tribal and communal organization of the people, which still existed in the second half of the eighth century, to the militaristic structure of society with a strong princely power, as is known to have existed in the ninth century, becomes almost unaccountable. The pressure from the west and north was, no doubt, an important element, but it alone would hardly seem sufficient to explain the change. Economic and cultural reasons had unquestionably exercised a great influence in the rapid molding of a new form of political life which was more adapted to conditions that had arisen since the change from nomadic pursuits to settled agriculture.

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, Kruszwica was occupied by Germany until 1945. From 1940 to 1942, the Germans operated a forced labour camp for Jewish women in the town, and afterwards from 1942 to 1943 a forced labour camp for Jewish men. The Polish resistance movement was active in Kruszwica. Władysław Kostuj, who organized the local branch of the Secret Teaching Organization, was arrested in 1944 and murdered by the German gendarmerie.
From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Bydgoszcz Voivodeship.

== Tourism ==

Kruszwica has a great opportunity for development in tourism. There is a hotel with restaurant, &#x27;Zajazd u Piasta Kołodzieja&#x27;, located by the Mice Tower and the lake Gopło. There are also summer houses and campsites in the town. In the neighboring village of Kobylniki, there is a French-style palace serving as a hotel.

The town is well prepared to accommodate tourists, including foreigners, who are increasingly numerous. The city is well-developed with regard to cuisine. In Kruszwica, there are boat trips on the lake, yacht, canoe and pedal boat rentals, horse stud and carriage rides around the area, beaches and bathing areas, lake viewing terraces and other attractions.

Rowing championships for the European and Polish cup, as well as several smaller categories, are organized every year in Kruszwica.

<text>Mogilno (; ) is a town in central Poland, seat of the Mogilno County in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship.

==History==

Mogilno is one of the oldest settlements along the border of the Greater Poland and Kuyavia historical regions. Since the turn of the 8th and 9th century until the 10th century an early-medieval settlement existed there, at the long narrow headland surrounded by waters of Mogilno Lake from the west and south and marshes from the east.

In 1065, a Benedictine abbey was founded there by Bolesław the Generous. North of the abbey a town later developed, which in 1398 was granted a town charter by King Władysław II Jagiełło, and which was the abbey&#x27;s property until 1773. Administratively it was located in the Gniezno County in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland.

After the First Partition of Poland in 1772 the town became a part of the Kingdom of Prussia. In local baptism records from 1792, the town is spelled Mogillno. After the successful Greater Poland uprising of 1806, it was regained by Poles and included within the Duchy of Warsaw, and after its dissolution, it was re-annexed by Prussia in 1815. In 1918, Poland regained independence, and shortly afterwards the Greater Poland uprising broke out, which goal was to reunite the town and region with the reborn Polish state. The town was liberated by Polish insurgents on 1 January 1919.

Since 1898 until his death in 1910 a parish priest in Mogilno&#x27;s other church St. Jacob (Św. Jakuba) was Piotr Wawrzyniak.

===Second World War===

During the German invasion of Poland at the start of World War II, it was the site of fierce Polish defense. On 18 September 1939, German forces incited by members of Mogilno German minority killed 40 Poles, one of whom was of Jewish descent. The victims were picked out by local Volksdeutsche with Polish citizenship for execution. The oldest victim was 75, the youngest 17. The first expulsions of Poles, mainly families of massacred Polish defenders and families of Poles who were murdered or deported to concentration camps during the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, as well as owners of larger houses, shops, workshops and barbershops, were carried out in November and December 1939. On 14–19 April 1940, during the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, the Gestapo carried out mass arrests of local Poles, who were then imprisoned in the local prison. Further expulsions of 491 Poles, including disabled and ill people, were carried out by the German police in 1941. Poles were deported to the General Government in the more-eastern part of German-occupied Poland, while their houses were handed over to Germans as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. From 1941 to 1943, the Germans operated a forced labour camp for Jewish men in the town.

The Polish resistance movement was active in Mogilno, including local units of the &quot;Wielkopolska Organizacja Wojskowa&quot;, &quot;Wojskowa Organizacja Ziem Zachodnich&quot;, Grey Ranks, Union of Armed Struggle and Home Army. Two Polish underground newspapers were printed in the town. In 1940, the Germans arrested the leaders of the local unit of &quot;Wojskowa Organizacja Ziem Zachodnich&quot;, who were then imprisoned in various Nazi prisons and eventually sentenced to death and beheaded in Poznań in 1942. Bogdan Friedrich, commander of the local unit of the Union of Armed Struggle was arrested by the Gestapo in mid-1942 and died in the Rawicz prison after a brutal interrogation, whereas Stanisław Szperka, commander of the local Home Army unit, was arrested by the Gestapo in August 1944; he died during his deportation from a prison in Żabikowo to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Several organizers of the local resistance units were also arrested in 1942–1944 and either murdered during Gestapo interrogations or sentenced to death and executed.

<text>Golub-Dobrzyń () is a town in north-central Poland, located on the Drwęca. It is the capital of Golub-Dobrzyń County in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship and has a population of 13,060.

Golub-Dobrzyń was established on May 5, 1951 through merging two neighbouring towns having faced each other across the river Drwęca for centuries, namely Golub located in the Chełmno Land within historical Pomerelia and Dobrzyń located in the Dobrzyń Land within historical Kuyavia.

==History==
===History of Golub===

The village Golub, populated by Poles, was first mentioned in a document from 1258; Chełmno Land was granted as a fief by the Duke of Mazovia to the Teutonic Knights in 1231 in return for their forthcoming crusade against the heathen Prussians. The Teutonic Knights built a castle (1296–1306) and elevated it to town status. In the 14th century, papal verdicts ordered the restoration of the area to Poland, however, the Teutonic Knights did not comply and continued to occupy the region. In 1421 all privileges of the town were confirmed by Grand Master Michael Küchmeister von Sternberg. In 1410 and 1422, the castle and town were captured by the Poles, and Golub was severely damaged, with the war of 1422 called the Golub War. In March 1454, King Casimir IV Jagiellon reincorporated the town into the Kingdom of Poland, and in May 1454 it pledged allegiance to the Polish King in Toruń. During the subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War, it was captured by the Teutonic Knights in 1460, and recaptured by the Poles in 1462. Reintegration with Poland was confirmed in the Second Peace of Toruń (1466).

Golub was a royal town of Poland, administratively located in the Chełmno County in the Chełmno Voivodeship. A degree of prosperity for Golub was reached during the reign of King Sigismund III Vasa 1611-25. In 1605, Anna Vasa, sister of Sigismund III, became the starost of Golub, and she lived in the Golub Castle. In 1623, she was visited in Golub by Sigismund III. However the town was severely damaged during Polish-Swedish Wars, especially in 1626-29, 1655, and 1660, as well as the later Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–63). In the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Golub was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. From 1807-15 it belonged to Napoleon&#x27;s Duchy of Warsaw. It was assigned to the Duchy of Poznan in 1815, and in 1817 it was included in West Prussia which in 1871 became part of Imperial Germany. According to the German census of 1890, Golub had a population of 2,738, of which 1,000 (36.5%) were Poles.

In January 1920 it became again part of Poland under the Treaty of Versailles. In August 1920, the Red Army attacked the town. Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was occupied and unilaterally annexed by Nazi Germany and most of dwellers were forced to sign the Volksliste.

===History of Dobrzyń===

Since the second half of the 17th century, Dobrzyń existed as a settlement on the loft bank of the Drwęca. In 1684 Zygmunt Działyński named the settlement &quot;Przedmieście Golubskie&quot;. It was administratively located in the Rypin County in the Inowrocław Voivodeship. In 1789 Count Ignacy Działyński founded the town of Dobrzyń. In 1793 after the Second Partition of Poland, Dobrzyń was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. From 1807-15 it belonged to the Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815 it was included in the Kingdom of Poland in personal union with the Russian Empire. In the second half of the 19th century the Kingdom of Poland was &quot;de facto&quot; demoted and renamed Vistula Land, while the town developed quickly with a growing Jewish population, eventually surpassing Golub.

Dobrzyń became part of the Second Polish Republic in 1918 following World War I. In August 1920, the Soviet Red Army attacked the town. At the start of World War II, in 1939, it was occupied and unilaterally annexed by Nazi Germany and most of its dwellers were deported to Nazi concentration camps. The local intelligentsia was murdered through executions during the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;.

==Monuments and landmarks==
*The Golub Castle of the Teutonic Knights, built at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, later rebuilt and extended in the 15th century. Between 1616 and 1623 it was a residence of Anna of Finland; during this period a Renaissance attic was added. The castle was destroyed during The Deluge. In the 19th century, it was neglected and a gale caused the collapse of its attic. After 1945 the castle was rebuilt and renovated.
*Gothic church of St. Catherine, dating back to the beginning of the 14th century, with the Renaissance chapel of the Kostka family
*Relics of defence walls
*Wooden arcaded house in the market square dating back to the end of the 18th century
*In Dobrzyń - Classicistic church built between 1823 and 1827

<text>The red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer) is a member of the bulbul family of passerines. It is a resident breeder across the Indian subcontinent, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka extending east to Burma and parts of Bhutan and Nepal. It has been introduced in many other parts of the world and has established itself in Argentina, Tonga and Fiji, as well as parts of Samoa, USA and Cook Islands. It is included in the list of the world&#x27;s 100 worst invasive alien species. In NZ they were the target of a successful extermination campaign in 1955, however they are still sporadically reported.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the red-vented bulbul in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen that he mistakenly believed had been collected from the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. He used the French name &quot;Le merle hupé du Cap de Bonne Espérance&quot; and the Latin &quot;Merula Cristata Capitis Bonae Spei&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the red-vented bulbul. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Turdus cafer&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The red-vented bulbul does not occur in Africa. The type location was later changed to Sri Lanka and then in 1952 designated as Pondicherry in India by the German naturalist Erwin Stresemann. The specific epithet &quot;cafer&quot; is Neo-Latin for South Africa. This species is now placed in the genus &quot;Pycnonotus&quot; that was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826.

Two formerly designated races, &quot;P. c. nigropileus&quot; in southern Burma and &quot;P. c. burmanicus&quot; of northern Burma, are now considered as hybrids.
===Subspecies===
Eight subspecies are recognized:
* Central Indian red-vented bulbul (&quot;P. c. humayuni&quot;) - : Found in south-eastern Pakistan, north-western and north-central India
* Punjab red-vented bulbul (&quot;P. c. intermedius&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in Kashmir and Kohat down to the Salt Range and along the western Himalayas to Kumaon.
* &quot;P. c. bengalensis&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in the central and eastern Himalayas from Nepal to Assam, north-eastern India and Bangladesh
* &quot;P. c. stanfordi&quot; - : Found in northern Burma and south-western China
* &quot;P. c. melanchimus&quot; - : Found in south-central Burma and northern Thailand
* &quot;P. c. wetmorei&quot; - : Found in eastern India
** &quot;P. c. saturatus&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species &quot;Stelgidocichla latirostris saturata&quot; . Found in north-eastern India
* &quot;P. c. cafer&quot; - : Found in southern India
* &quot;P. c. haemorrhousus&quot; - : Found in Sri Lanka

==Description==
The red-vented bulbul is easily identified by its short crest giving the head a squarish appearance. The body is dark brown with a scaly pattern while the head is darker or black. The rump is white while the vent is red. It is about 20 cm in length, with a long black tail, tipped in white. The Himalayan races have a more prominent crest and are more streaked on the underside. The race &quot;intermedius&quot; of the Western Himalayas has a black hood extending to the mid-breast. The population &quot;bengalensis&quot; of the Central and Eastern Himalayas and the Gangetic plain has a dark hood, lacks the scale-like pattern on the underside and instead has dark streaks on the paler lower belly. Race &quot;stanfordi&quot; of the South Assam hills is similar to &quot;intermedius&quot;. The desert race &quot;humayuni&quot; has a paler brown mantle. The nominate race &quot;cafer&quot; is found in Peninsular India. The Northeast Indian race &quot;wetmorei&quot; is between &quot;cafer&quot;, &quot;humayuni&quot; and &quot;bengalensis&quot;. The Sri Lankan race &quot;haemorrhous&quot; (=&quot;haemorrhousus&quot;) has a dark mantle with narrow pale edges. Race &quot;humayuni&quot; is known to hybridize with &quot;Pycnonotus leucogenys&quot; and these hybrids were once described as a subspecies &quot;magrathi&quot; marked by their pale rumps and yellow-orange or pink vents. In eastern Myanmar there is some natural hybridization with &quot;Pycnonotus aurigaster&quot;.

Sexes are similar in plumage, but young birds are duller than adults. The typical call has been transcribed as &quot;ginger beer&quot;, but a number of sharp single note calls sounding like &quot;pick&quot; are also produced. Their alarm calls are usually responded to and heeded by many other species of bird.

Melanistic as well as leucistic individuals have been noted. An individual with aberrant colour form was observed in Bhavans College Campus, Andheri, Mumbai.

==Distribution and habitat==
This is a bird of dry scrub, open forest, plains and cultivated lands. In its native range it is rarely found in mature forests. A study based on 54 localities in India concluded that vegetation is the single most important factor that determines the distribution of the species.

Red-vented bulbuls were introduced into Fiji in 1903 by indentured labourers from India, becoming widespread. They were introduced to Tonga in 1943 and became common on Samoa by 1957. They became established on the Tongan islands of Tongatapu and Niuafo&#x27;ou. They were introduced into Melbourne around 1917 but were not seen after 1942. They established in Auckland in the 1950s but were exterminated and another wild population was detected and exterminated in 2006. In 2013 more were found, and authorities offered a $1000 reward for information that led to a bird&#x27;s capture. They prefer dry lowland habitat in these regions. They were first observed breeding on the Canary Islands in 2018. They are considered as pests because of their habit of damaging fruit crops. Methiocarb and ziram have been used to protect cultivated &quot;Dendrobium&quot; orchids in Hawaii from damage by these birds; however, they learn to avoid the repellent chemicals. They can also disperse the seeds of invasive plants like &quot;Lantana camara&quot; and &quot;Miconia calvescens&quot;.

&quot;P. cafer&quot; is invasive in New Caledonia. Thibault et al. (2018) finds this species to be pushing out native species but not other introduced species.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Red-vented bulbuls feed on fruits, petals of flowers, nectar, insects and occasionally house geckos (Hemidactylus flaviviridis). They have also been seen feeding on the leaves of &quot;Medicago sativa&quot;.

Red-vented bulbuls build their nests in bushes at a height of around . Nests are occasionally built inside houses or in a hole in a mud bank. In one instance, a nest was found on a floating mat of Water hyacinth leaves and another observer noted a pair nesting inside a regularly used bus. Nests in tree cavities have also been noted. Nesting in safe cavities of residential buildings has also been noted.

They breed from June to September and lay two or three eggs in a typical clutch. The eggs are pale-pinkish with spots of dark red color which are more dense at the broad end. However, in one instance, breeding has also been observed in February in Tamil Nadu. They are capable of having multiple clutches in a year. Nests are small flat cups made of small dry twigs and spider web, but sometimes making use of metal wires. The eggs hatch after about 14 days. Both parents feed the chicks and on feeding trips wait for the young to excrete, swallowing the faecal sacs produced for the first few days when the bacterial level is minimum. Later they carry the faecal sacs and dump them elsewhere. The pied crested cuckoo is a brood parasite of this species. Fires, heavy rains and predators are the main causes of fledgling mortality in scrub habitats in southern India.

Their vocalizations are usually stereotyped and they call throughout the year. However, a number of distinct call types have been identified including roosting, begging, greeting, flight and two kinds of alarm calls.

They are important dispersers of seeds of plants such as &quot;Carissa spinarum&quot;.

The red-vented bulbul was among the first animals other than humans that was found to be incapable of synthesizing vitamin C. However, a large number of other birds were later found to likewise lack the ability to synthesize vitamin C.

Like most birds, these bulbuls are hosts to coccidian blood parasites (&quot;Isospora&quot; sp.) while some bird lice such as &quot;Menacanthus guldum&quot; (Ansari 1951 Proc. Natl. Inst. Sci. India 17:40) have been described as ectoparasites.

Along with red-whiskered bulbuls this species has led to changes in the population dynamics of butterfly morphs on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. Here the population of white morphs of the &quot;Danaus plexippus&quot; butterfly has risen over a period of 20 years due to predation of the orange morphs by these bulbuls.

==In culture==
In 19th-century India these birds were frequently kept as cage pets and for fighting especially in the Carnatic region. They would be held on the finger with a thread attached and when they fought they would seize the red feathers of the opponents.
In the state of Assam, India, (the Bulbul (বুলবুলী) bird as it is known in Assamese), the male birds were held captive for a few days and were engaged in fights as a spectator sport in the Bihu festival during the Ahom rule. This practice was banned in January 2016.

<doc id="624385" wikidata="Q64582" url="?curid=624385" title="Karl Wilhelm Naundorff">
<text>Karl Wilhelm Naundorff (27 March 1785 (alleged) – 10 August 1845) was a German clockmaker and watchmaker who until his death claimed to be Prince Louis-Charles, or Louis XVII of France, son of Louis XVI, King of France and Marie Antoinette of Austria. Naundorff was one of the more stubborn of more than thirty men who claimed to be Louis XVII.

==Biography==

Prince Louis-Charles, the son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, was imprisoned during the French Revolution and believed to have died in prison. However, there were various rumors that monarchist sympathizers had spirited the young dauphin away from the Temple prison and that he was living elsewhere in secret. 

Among those said to be involved in his escape are Paul Barras and Josephine Beauharnais.

The first records of Karl Wilhelm Naundorff are from 1810 in Spandau, Berlin, where he received the citizenship of Prussia. By 1822 he had moved to live with a family in Brandenburg-on-the-Havel where he was later accused of arson. In 1824, Naundorff was jailed for three years for counterfeiting.

===Impersonation===
When he was released in 1827, he moved to Crossen and wrote the first of two books of would-be-memoirs. The second he wrote in England many years later and was translated to English by Charles G. Perceval, Rector of Calverton, Buckinghamshire, and nephew of Spencer Perceval. He claimed that he had been substituted with a deaf and mute orphan who died soon afterward and that he had been hidden in a secret area of the Tower of the Temple until his escape. He also claimed that he was later recaptured by Napoleon&#x27;s forces and secretly kept in several dungeons throughout Europe until finally escaping in his mid-twenties. He could present no proof of any of this.

In 1833, Naundorff travelled to Paris where another claimant to the French throne, the Baron de Richemont, was on trial. One of the witnesses for the prosecution read out his letter as a counterclaim.

Despite the fact that Naundorff did not speak French very well, he managed to convince various former members of Louis XVI&#x27;s court that he was the Dauphin. He seemed to know everything about the private life of the royal court, gave right answers to most questions and spoke to courtiers as if he had known them as a child. One of them was Agathe de Rambaud, Louis&#x27; childhood nurse who accepted him. Others who claimed to have recognized him as the prince include Étienne de Joly, King Louis XVI&#x27;s Minister of Justice, and Jean Bremond, the king&#x27;s personal secretary.

However, Princess Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte, the sister of Prince Louis, did not acknowledge him. She had seen pictures of him, but claimed that she did not see any resemblance to her brother. She refused even to see him, despite having seen other claimants who were not represented by former members of the royal court. On one occasion Agathe de Rambaud travelled to Prague by carriage to persuade her but to no avail. The princess refused to see her as well.

In 1836, Naundorff sued Marie Thérèse for property that supposedly belonged to him. Instead, the police force of king Louis-Philippe arrested him, seized all his papers and deported him to England. There he worked to develop several military inventions, including an early grenade, and a recoilless rifle which he eventually sold to the Dutch Military. He declared that he would be restored to the throne on 1 January 1840. When that date passed, he lost the majority of his supporters.

===Legacy and continued controversy===

Naundorff died on 10 August 1845 in Delft, the Netherlands, possibly of poisoning. He had been living there with his family after being made Director of Pyrotechnics for the Dutch Military. He still had some supporters because the epitaph on his grave reads &quot;Here lies Louis XVII, King of France&quot; and in his death certificate he is named as &quot;Charles-Louis de Bourbon, Duke of Normandy (Louis XVII), who was known under the name of Charles-Guillaume Naundorff, [...] son of His Majesty the late Louis XVI, King of France and of Her Imperial and Royal Highness Marie Antoinette, Archduchess of Austria, Queen of France, who both died in Paris&quot;.

Naundorff&#x27;s descendants did not give up. Some of them insisted on using the surname &quot;de Bourbon&quot; and they petitioned for recognition to French courts and senates all through the 19th and 20th centuries. Circus director René Charles de Bourbon, an illegitimate son of one of Naundorff&#x27;s grandchildren, lost his claim in a French court in 1954. However, some of the descendants still press the claim.

A handful of French historians insist that DNA testing finally resolved the issue of Naundorff&#x27;s claim. In a research in 1998-2000, mitochondrial DNA sequences of remains that researchers have claimed to have belonged to Naundorff were compared with sequences obtained from the remains of Marie-Antoinette and two of her sisters and two living maternal relatives. They argue that differences in the nucleotide sequences make it very unlikely that Naundorff was the son of Marie-Antoinette. A group of his descendants disagree that the remains are those of Naundorff and are independently continuing the investigation. As of 2014-16, based on DNA extracted from Naundorff&#x27;s hair, it was found that there are 7 out of 16 sequence differences of Y-STR from the Y-chromosome between Naundorff and Louis XVI, therefore making Naundorff unlikely the son of Louis XVI.

<text>Aleksandr Mikhaylovich Vasilevsky (; 30 September 1895 – 5 December 1977) was a Soviet general who served as a top commander during World War II and achieved the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union. During World War II, he served as the chief of the General Staff and deputy Minister of Defense, and later served as Minister of Defense from 1949 to 1953.

Born in central Russia, Vasilevsky began his military career in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and earned the rank of captain by 1917. After the October Revolution of 1917 and the start of the Russian Civil War, he was conscripted into the Red Army and took part in the Polish-Soviet War. Following the war, Vasilevsky quickly rose through the ranks, and in 1931 was appointed to the Directorate of Military Training. In 1939, after Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge, he was appointed deputy chief of operations of the Red Army.

Soon after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Vasilevsky was promoted to chief of operations and deputy chief of the general staff on the recommendation of his mentor Boris Shaposhnikov. In June 1942, he succeeded Shaposhnikov as chief of the general staff, and also became deputy minister of defense that October. In these capacities, Vasilevsky coordinated fronts and often planned offensives in collaboration with Georgy Zhukov, particularly at the Battle of Kursk in 1943 and in Operation Bagration in 1944. He was made a Marshal of the Soviet Union in February 1943 after playing a key role at the Battle of Stalingrad. In February 1945, Vasilevsky gained command of the 3rd Belorussian Front in Germany and stepped down as chief of the general staff. After Germany&#x27;s surrender, he was appointed commander-in-chief of Soviet forces in the Far East in July 1945 and carried out the invasion of Manchuria that August.

After the war, Vasilevsky again served as chief of the general staff from 1946 to 1948, and as Soviet Defense Minister from 1949 until after Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953. After Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s rise to the Soviet leadership, Vasilevsky was removed from his positions in 1957. After his death in 1977, he was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in recognition of his past service and contributions to his country.

==Biography==

===Childhood and early years===
Vasilevsky was born on September 30, 1895, in Novaya Golchikha in the Kineshma Uyezd (now part of the city of Vichuga, Ivanovo Oblast) in a family of Russian ethnicity. Vasilevsky was the fourth of eight children. His father, Mikhail Aleksandrovich Vasilevsky, was a priest to the nearby St. Nicholas Church. His mother, Nadezhda Ivanovna Sokolova, was the daughter of a priest in the nearby village of Ugletz. Vasilevsky reportedly broke off all contact with his parents after 1926 because of his Communist Party membership and his military duties in the Red Army; three of his brothers did so also. However, the family resumed relations in 1940, following Joseph Stalin&#x27;s suggestion that they do so.

According to Vasilevsky, his family was extremely poor. His father spent most of his time working to earn money, while the children assisted by working in the fields. In 1897, the family moved to Novopokrovskoe, where his father became a priest to the newly built Ascension Church, and where Aleksandr began his education in the church school. In 1909, he entered Kostroma seminary, which required considerable financial sacrifice on the part of his parents. The same year, a ministerial directive preventing former seminarists from starting university studies initiated a nationwide seminarist movement, with classes stopping in most Russian seminaries. Vasilevsky, among others, was expelled from Kostroma, and only returned several months later, after the seminarists&#x27; demands had been satisfied.

===World War I and Civil war===

After completing his studies in the seminary and spending a few years working as a teacher, Vasilevsky intended to become an agronomist or a surveyor, but the outbreak of the First World War changed his plans. According to his own words, he was &quot;overwhelmed with patriotic feelings&quot; and decided to become a soldier instead. Vasilevsky took his exams in January 1915 and entered the Alexander Military Law Academy in February. As he recalls, &quot;I did not decide to become an officer to start a military career. I still wanted to be an agronomist and work in some remote corner of Russia after the war. I could not suppose that my country would change, and I would.&quot; After four months of courses that he later considered to be completely outdated, theoretical, and inappropriate for modern warfare, he was sent to the front with the rank of praporshchik, the highest non-commissioned rank in the Russian infantry, in May 1915.

From June to September, Vasilevsky was assigned to a series of reserve regiments, and finally arrived at the front in September as a half-company commander (&quot;polurotny&quot;) in the 409th Novokhopersky regiment, 109th division, 9th Army. In the spring of 1916, Vasilevsky took command of a company, which eventually became one of the most recognized in the regiment. In May 1916, he led his men during the Brusilov offensive, becoming a battalion commander after heavy casualties among officers, and gaining the rank of captain by age 22.
In November 1917, just after the Russian Revolution, Vasilevsky decided to end his military career. As he wrote in his memoirs, &quot;There was a time when I led soldiers to battle, thinking I was doing my duty as a Russian patriot. However, I understood that we have been cheated, that people needed peace... Therefore, my military career had to end. With no remorse, I could go back to my favorite occupation, working in the field.&quot; He travelled from Romania, where his unit was deployed in 1917, back to his own village.

In December 1917, while back at home, Vasilevsky learned that the men of the 409th regiment, which had been relocated to Ukraine, had elected him as their commander (at the start of the Russian Revolution, commanders were elected by their own men). However, the local military authorities recommended that he decline the proposal because of the heavy fighting taking place in Ukraine between pro-Soviet forces and the pro-independence Ukrainian government (the Central Rada). He followed this advice and became a drill instructor in his own Kineshma uezd. He retired in September 1918 and became a school teacher in the Tula Oblast.

In April 1919, Vasilevsky was again conscripted into the Red Army and sent to command a company fighting against peasant uprisings and assisting in the emergency Soviet policy of prodrazvyorstka, which required peasants to surrender agricultural surplus for a fixed price. Later that year, Vasilevsky took command of a new reserve battalion, and, in October 1919, of a regiment. However, his regiment never took part in the battles of the Russian Civil War, as Anton Denikin&#x27;s troops never got close to Tula. In December 1919, Vasilevsky was sent to the Western front as a deputy regimental commander, participating in the Polish-Soviet War.

As deputy regimental commander of the 427th regiment, 32nd brigade, 11th division, Vasilevsky participated at the battle of Berezina, pulling back as the Polish forces had been slowly but steadily advancing eastward, and in the subsequent counterattack that began on May 14, 1920, breaking through Polish lines before being stopped by cavalry counterattacks. Later, starting from July 4, 1920, he took part at the Soviet offensive towards Wilno, advancing to the Neman River despite heavy Polish resistance and German fortifications erected in the region during World War I. Vasilevsky&#x27;s regiment arrived near Wilno by mid-July and stayed there on a garrison duty until the Treaty of Riga.

===The interwar period===

After the Treaty of Riga, Vasilevsky fought against remaining White forces and peasant uprisings in Belarus and in the Smolensk Oblast until August 1921. By 1930, he had served as the regimental commander of the 142nd, 143rd, and 144th rifle regiments, where he showed great skill in organizing and training his troops. In 1928, he graduated from the &quot;Vystrel&quot; regimental commander&#x27;s course. During these years, Vasilevsky established friendships with higher commanders and Party members, including Kliment Voroshilov, Vladimir Triandafillov and Boris Shaposhnikov. Shaposhnikov, in particular, would become Vasilevsky&#x27;s protector until the former&#x27;s death in 1945. Vasilevsky&#x27;s connections and good performance earned him an appointment to the Directorate of Military Training in 1931.

While at the Directorate of Military Training, Vasilevsky supervised the Red Army&#x27;s training and worked on military manuals and field books. He also met several senior military commanders, such as Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Georgy Zhukov, then the Deputy Cavalry Inspector of the Red Army. Zhukov would later characterize Vasilevsky as &quot;a man who knew his job as he spent a long time commanding a regiment and who earned great respect from everybody.&quot; In 1934, Vasilevsky was appointed to be the Senior Military Training Supervisor of the Volga Military District (&quot;Privolzhsky voyenny okrug&quot;). In 1937, he entered the Academy of the General Staff, where he studied important aspects of military strategy and other topics under experienced generals, including Mikhail Tukhachevsky.

By mid-1937, Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge eliminated a significant number of senior military commanders, vacating a number of positions on the General Staff. To his amazement, Vasilevsky was appointed to the General Staff in October 1937 and held &quot;responsible for operational training of senior officers.&quot; In 1938, he was made a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (a sine qua non condition for a successful career in the Soviet Union); in 1939, he was appointed Deputy Commander of the Operations Directorate of the General Staff, while holding the rank of divisional commander. While in this position he and Shaposhnikov were responsible for the planning of the Winter War, and after the Moscow peace treaty, for setting the demarcation line with Finland.

As a senior officer, Vasilevsky met frequently with Joseph Stalin. During one of these meetings, Stalin asked Vasilevsky about his family. Since Vasilevsky&#x27;s father was a priest and thus a potential &quot;enemy of the people&quot;, Vasilevsky said that he had ended his relationship with them in 1926. Stalin, surprised, suggested that he reestablish his family ties at once, and help his parents with whatever needs they might have.

===World War II===

====Start and Battle of Moscow====

By June 1941, Vasilevsky was working around the clock in his General Staff office. On June 22, 1941, he learned of the German bombing of several important military and civilian objectives, starting Operation Barbarossa. In August 1941, Vasilevsky was appointed Chief of the Operations Directorate of the General Staff and Deputy Chief of the General Staff, making him one of the key figures in the Soviet military leadership. At the end of September 1941, Vasilevsky gave a speech before the General Staff, describing the situation as extremely difficult, but pointing out that the northern part of the front was holding, that Leningrad still offered resistance, and that such a situation would potentially allow some reserves to be gathered in the northern part of the front.

In October 1941, the situation at the front was becoming critical, with German forces advancing towards Moscow during Operation Typhoon. As a representative of the Soviet General Staff (Stavka), Vasilevsky was sent to the Western Front to coordinate the defense and guarantee a flow of supplies and men towards the region of Mozhaisk, where Soviet forces were attempting to contain the German advance. During heavy fighting near the outskirts of Moscow, Vasilevsky spent all of his available time both in the Stavka and on the front line trying to coordinate the three fronts committed to Moscow&#x27;s defense. When most of the General Staff (including its chief Marshal Shaposhnikov) was evacuated from Moscow, Vasilevsky remained in the city as liaison between the Moscow Staff and the evacuated members of the General Staff. In his memoirs, Nikita Khrushchev described Vasilevsky as an &quot;able specialist&quot; even so early in the war. On October 28, 1941, Vasilevsky was promoted to Lieutenant General.

The Battle of Moscow was a very difficult period in Vasilevsky&#x27;s life, with the Wehrmacht approaching close enough to the city for German officers to make out some of Moscow&#x27;s buildings through their field glasses. As he recalls, his workday often ended at 4 a.m. Moreover, with Marshal Shaposhnikov having fallen ill, Vasilevsky had to make important decisions by himself. On October 29, 1941, a bomb exploded in the courtyard of the General Staff. Vasilevsky was slightly wounded but continued working. The kitchen was damaged by the explosion, and the General Staff was relocated underground without hot food. Nevertheless, the Staff continued to function. In December 1941, Vasilevsky coordinated the Moscow counteroffensive, and by early 1942, the general counteroffensive in the Moscow and Rostov directions, further motivated in his work by the return of his evacuated family to Moscow. In April 1942, he coordinated the unsuccessful elimination of the Demyansk pocket, the encirclement of the German 2nd Army Corps near Leningrad. On April 24, with Shaposhnikov seriously ill again, Vasilevsky was appointed as acting Chief of Staff and promoted to Colonel General on April 26.

====Summer and fall 1942====

In May 1942 one of the most controversial episodes in Vasilevsky&#x27;s career occurred: the Second Battle of Kharkov, a failed counteroffensive that led to a stinging Red Army defeat, and ultimately to a successful German offensive (Operation Blue) in the south. After repelling the enemy from Moscow, Soviet morale was high and Stalin was determined to launch another general counteroffensive during the summer. However, Vasilevsky recognized that &quot;the reality was more harsh than that.&quot; Following Stalin&#x27;s orders, the Kharkov offensive was launched on May 12, 1942. When the threat of encirclement became obvious, Vasilevsky and Zhukov asked for permission to withdraw the advancing Soviet forces. Stalin refused, leading to the encirclement of the Red Army forces and a total defeat. In his memoirs, Khrushchev accused Vasilevsky of being too passive and indecisive, as well as being unable to defend his point of view in front of Stalin during that particular operation. As he wrote, &quot;It was my view that the catastrophe... could have been avoided if Vasilevsky had taken the position he should have. He could have taken a different position... but he didn&#x27;t do that, and as a result, in my view, he had a hand in the destruction of thousands of Red Army fighters in the Kharkov campaign.&quot;

In June 1942, Vasilevsky was briefly sent to Leningrad to coordinate an attempt to break the encirclement of the 2nd Shock Army led by General Andrei Vlasov. On June 26, 1942, Vasilevsky was appointed Chief of the General Staff, and, in October 1942, Deputy Minister of Defense. He was now one of the few people responsible for the global planning of Soviet offensives. Starting from July 23, 1942, Vasilevsky was a Stavka representative on the Stalingrad front, which he correctly anticipated as the main axis of attack.

The battle of Stalingrad was another difficult period in Vasilevsky&#x27;s life. Sent with Zhukov to the Stalingrad Front, he tried to coordinate the defenses of Stalingrad with radio links working intermittently, at best. On September 12, 1942, during a meeting with Stalin, Vasilevsky and Zhukov presented their plan for the Stalingrad counteroffensive after an all-night planning session. Two months later, on November 19, with Stalingrad still unconquered, Operation Uranus was launched. Since Zhukov had been sent to near Rzhev to execute Operation Mars (the Rzhev counteroffensive), Vasilevsky remained near Stalingrad to coordinate the double-pincer attack that ultimately led to the German defeat and annihilation of the armies entrapped in the cauldron, all a result of the plan he had presented to Stalin on December 9. This plan sparked some debate between Vasilevsky and Rokossovsky, who wanted an additional army for clearing Stalingrad, which Rokossovsky continued to mention to Vasilevsky even years after the war. The army in question was Rodion Malinovsky&#x27;s 2nd Guards&#x27; which Vasilevsky committed against a dangerous German counter-attack launched from Kotelnikovo by the 57th Panzer corps that was designed to deblockade the Stalingrad pocket.

====Soviet victory====
In January 1943, Vasilevsky coordinated the offensives on the upper Don River near Voronezh and Ostrogozhsk, leading to decisive encirclements of several Axis divisions. In mid-January, Vasilevsky was promoted to General of the Army and only 29 days later, on February 16, 1943, to Marshal of the Soviet Union.

In March 1943, after the creation of the Kursk salient and the failure of the Third Battle of Kharkov, Stalin and the Stavka had to decide if the offensive should be resumed despite this setback, or if it was better to adopt a defensive stance. Vasilevsky and Zhukov managed to persuade Stalin that it was necessary to halt the offensive for now, and wait for the initiative from the Wehrmacht. When it became clear that the supposed German offensive was postponed and would no longer take place in May 1943 as expected, Vasilevsky successfully defended continuing to wait for the Wehrmacht to attack, rather than making a preemptive strike as Khrushchev wanted. When the Battle of Kursk finally began on July 4, 1943, Vasilevsky was responsible for coordinating the Voronezh and Steppe Fronts. After the German failure at Kursk and the start of the general counteroffensive on the left bank of the Dnieper, Vasilevsky planned and executed offensive operations in the Donbas region. Later that year, he developed and executed the clearing of Nazi forces from Crimea.
At the start of 1944, Vasilevsky coordinated the Soviet offensive on the right bank of the Dnieper, leading to a decisive victory in eastern Ukraine. On April 10, 1944, the day Odessa was retaken, Vasilevsky was presented with the Order of Victory, only the second ever awarded (the first having been awarded to Zhukov). Vasilevsky&#x27;s car rolled over a mine during an inspection of Sevastopol after the fighting ended on May 10, 1944. He received a head wound, cut by flying glass, and was evacuated to Moscow for recovery.

During Operation Bagration, the general counteroffensive in Belarus, Vasilevsky coordinated the offensives of the 1st Baltic and 3rd Belorussian Fronts. When Soviet forces entered the Baltic states, Vasilevsky assumed complete responsibility for all the Baltic fronts, discarding the 3rd Belorussian. On July 29, 1944, he was made Hero of the Soviet Union for his military successes. In February 1945, Vasilevsky was again appointed commander of 3rd Belorussian Front to lead the East Prussian Operation, leaving the post of General Chief of Staff to Aleksei Antonov. As a front commander, Vasilevsky led the East Prussian operation and organized the assaults on Königsberg and Pillau. He also negotiated the surrender of the Königsberg garrison with its commander, Otto Lasch. After the war, Lasch claimed that Vasilevsky did not respect the guarantees made during the city&#x27;s capitulation. Indeed, Vasilevsky promised that German soldiers would not be executed, that prisoners, civilians and wounded would be treated decently, and that all prisoners would return to Germany after the end of the war. Instead, Lasch remained in prison for 10 years and returned to Germany only in 1955, as did many of the Wehrmacht soldiers and officers, while all German population was expelled from Eastern Prussia. For the brilliant successes at Königsberg and in Eastern Prussia, Vasilevsky was awarded his second Order of Victory.

John Erickson wrote that: &quot;Vasilevskii is a much underestimated soldier, a figure who flits about Soviet historiography but a commander inured to the battlefield yet deft in his handling of the whole Soviet war machine&quot;.

====Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation====
During the 1944 summer offensive, Stalin announced that he would appoint Vasilevsky Commander-in-Chief of USSR Forces in the Far East once the war against Germany ended. Vasilevsky began drafting the war plan for Japan by late 1944 and began full-time preparation by April 27, 1945. In June 1945, Stalin approved his plan. Vasilevsky then received the appointment of Commander-in-Chief of USSR Forces in the Far East and travelled by armoured train to Chita to execute the plan.

During the preparation phase, Vasilevsky further rehearsed the offensive with his army commanders and directed the start of Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation, also known as the &quot;Battle of Manchuria&quot;. In twenty-four days, from August 9 to September 2, 1945, Japanese armies in Manchukuo were defeated, with just 37,000 casualties out of 1,600,000 troops on the USSR side. For his success in this operation, Vasilevsky was awarded his second Hero of the Soviet Union decoration on September 8.

===After World War II===

Between 1946 and 1949, Vasilevsky remained Chief of Staff, then became Defense Minister from 1949 to 1953. Following Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, Vasilevsky fell from grace and was replaced by Nikolai Bulganin, although he remained deputy Defense minister. In 1956, he was appointed Deputy Defense Minister for Military Science, a secondary position with no real military power. Vasilevsky would occupy this position for only one year before being pensioned off by Nikita Khrushchev, thus becoming a victim of the bloodless purge that also saw the end of Zhukov. In 1959, he was appointed a General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense, an honorary position. In 1973, he published his memoirs, &quot;The Cause of My Whole Life.&quot; Aleksandr Vasilevsky died on December 5, 1977, at the age of 82. His body was cremated and his ashes immured in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

==Family==

In 1923, Vasilevsky married Serafima Nikolaevna Voronova (1904–1980), before divorcing in 1934. The couple had a son named Yuri (1925–2013), who went on to become a lieutenant general in the Soviet Air Force. Yuri was married to Era Zhukova, daughter of Georgy Zhukov.

Vasilevsky later re-married to Ekaterina Vasilievna Saburova, with whom he had a son named Igor (born 1935). Igor went on to become a well-known architect, and was recipient of the title of Honored Architect of the Russian Federation and the State Prize of Czechoslovakia. Igor is married to the daughter of Soviet statesman Ivan Tevosian.

==Awards==
In his memoirs, Vasilevsky recalls Stalin&#x27;s astonishment when, at a ceremony taking place in the Kremlin on December 4, 1941, the Soviet leader saw just a single Order of the Red Star and the medal &quot;XX years of the RKKA&quot; on Vasilevsky&#x27;s uniform. However, Vasilevsky eventually became one of the most decorated commanders in Soviet history.

Vasilevsky was awarded the Gold Star of Hero of the Soviet Union twice for operations on the German and Japanese fronts. He was awarded two Orders of Victory (an achievement matched only by Zhukov and Stalin) for his successes in Crimea and Prussia. During his career, he was awarded eight Orders of Lenin (several of them after the war), the Order of the October Revolution when it was created in 1967, two Orders of the Red Banner, a first class Order of Suvorov for his operations in Ukraine and Crimea, and his first decoration, an Order of the Red Star, earned in 1940 for his brilliant staff work during the Winter War. Finally, he was awarded a third class Order for Service to the Homeland as recognition for his entire military career when this order was created in 1974, just three years before Vasilevsky&#x27;s death.

Vasilevsky was also awarded fourteen medals. For his participation in various campaigns, he was awarded the Defense of Leningrad, Defense of Moscow, Defense of Stalingrad and Capture of Königsberg medals. As with all Soviet soldiers who took part in the war with Germany and Japan, he was awarded the Medal For the Victory Over Germany and the Medal &quot;For the Victory over Japan&quot;. He also received several commemorative medals, such as Twenty, Thirty, Forty, and Fifty Years Since the Creation of the Soviet Armed Forces medals, Twenty and Thirty Years Since the Victory in the Great Patriotic War medals, the Eight Hundredth Anniversary of Moscow medal (awarded in 1947 for his participation in the battle of Moscow) and the Hundredth Birthday of Lenin medal. In addition to Soviet orders and medals, Vasilevsky was awarded several foreign decorations such as the Polish &quot;Virtuti Militari&quot; Order from the Polish communist government.

==Personality and opinions==

Vasilevsky was regarded by his peers as a kind and soft military commander. General Sergei Shtemenko, a member of the General Staff during the war, described Vasilevsky as a brilliant, yet modest officer with outstanding experience in staff work. Shtemenko pointed out Vasilevsky&#x27;s prodigious talent for strategic and operational planning. Vasilevsky also showed his respect for subordinates and demonstrated an acute sense of diplomacy and politeness, which Stalin appreciated. As a result, Vasilevsky enjoyed almost unlimited trust from Stalin. Several years before the war, Zhukov described Vasilevsky as &quot;a man who knew his job as he spent a long time commanding a regiment and who earned great respect from everybody.&quot; During the war, Zhukov described Vasilevsky as an able commander, enjoying exceptional trust from Stalin, and able to persuade him even during heated discussions. Vasilevsky never mentioned his awards (including the two orders of Victory) in his memoirs, attesting to his modesty. American military historians David M. Glantz and Jonathan M. House wrote that Vasilevsky &quot;exercised a calm, rational influence&quot; on Stalin and was &quot;far less temperamental than Zhukov.&quot;

Vasilevsky&#x27;s actions and personality were sometimes the object of dispute, while less controversial than those of Zhukov. In particular, Nikita Khrushchev defined Vasilevsky in his memoirs as a passive commander completely under the control of Stalin, and blamed him for the Kharkov failure in Spring 1942. Among Vasilevsky&#x27;s strongest critics was Rokossovsky, who criticized Vasilevsky&#x27;s decisions during the Stalingrad counteroffensive, especially his refusal to commit the 2nd Army to the annihilation of the encircled German divisions, and for general interference with his own work. Rokossovsky even wrote in his memoirs: &quot;I do not even understand what role could Zhukov and Vasilevsky play on Stalingrad front.&quot; In fairness to Vasilevsky it needs noting that he diverted the 2nd army from the assault on the Stalingrad pocket only in order to commit it against a dangerous German counter-attack from Kotelnikovo, designed to deblockade the pocket, which was enjoying great numerical superiority. Vasilevsky, it seems, was dismayed by Rokossovsky&#x27;s opposition to the transfer.

On the other hand, the writer Victor Suvorov held up Vasilevsky over Zhukov. According to him, Vasilevsky was the only officer responsible for the successful planning and execution of the Soviet counteroffensive at Stalingrad, and Zhukov played no role whatsoever in it. He claimed that Vasilevsky was the best Soviet military commander and that Soviet victory was mainly due to his actions as the Chief of Staff. According to Suvorov, Zhukov and the Soviet propaganda machine tried, after the war, to reduce the role of the General Staff (and thus Vasilevsky&#x27;s importance) and to increase the role of the Party and Zhukov.

A post-1991 view on Vasilevsky was elaborated by Mezhiritzky in his book, &quot;Reading Marshal Zhukov&quot;. Mezhiritzky points out Vasilevsky&#x27;s timidity and his inability to defend his opinions before Stalin. Reportedly, Vasilevsky was appointed to such high military positions because he was easy to manage. However, Mezhiritzky recognizes Vasilevsky&#x27;s intelligence and assumes that Vasilevsky was indeed the main author of the Stalingrad counteroffensive. He also points out that Vasilevsky and Zhukov probably deliberately under-reported the estimated strength of the 6th Army to gain Stalin&#x27;s approval for that risky operation.

<text>Thursday Island, colloquially known as TI, or in the Kawrareg dialect, Waiben or Waibene, is an island of the Torres Strait Islands, an archipelago of at least 274 small islands in the Torres Strait. TI is located approximately north of Cape York Peninsula in Far North Queensland, Australia. 

Thursday Island is also the name of the town in the south and west of the island, formerly known as Port Kennedy, and also the name of the locality which contains the island within the Shire of Torres. The town of Rose Hill (known as Abednego until 7 September 1991) is located on the north-eastern tip of the island ().

In the , the locality of Thursday Island had a population of 2,805 people.

== Geography ==
Thursday Island has an area of about . The highest point on Thursday Island, standing at above sea level, is Milman Hill, a World War II defence facility.

While Thursday Island is within the Shire of Torres and is the administrative centre for that shire, it is also the administrative and commercial centre of the local government area of Torres Strait Island Region despite not being part of that local government area.

== History ==

The island has been populated for thousands of years by the Torres Strait Islanders, though archeological evidence on Badu, further north in Torres Strait, suggests that the area has been inhabited from before the end of the last Ice Age. The archaeology from Badu, Pulu, Saibai and Mer shows that Melanesian occupation started around 2,600 years ago (see Kalaw Lagaw Ya).

In 1848 a hydrographic survey of the area was conducted by Captain Owen Stanley of the Royal Navy, the commander of HMS &quot;Rattlesnake&quot;. He named this island Friday Island and another island Thursday Island (presumably reflecting the day of the week on which he named them). However, in June 1855 Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort of the Royal Navy (the Admiralty Hydrographer) decided to switch the names around, likely to preserve the east-west naming sequence with the present-day Friday Island and the nearby Wednesday Island.

The original place of permanent European settlement in Torres Strait was Somerset, south-east of the tip of Cape York Peninsula, established in 1864. However, the channel between Albany Island and Somerset proved to be hazardous for a port and in 1875 it was jointly decided by the Queensland and British governments to transfer the port to the deep anchorage on the south side of Thursday Island. The new port was called Port Kennedy, after Edmund Kennedy, the explorer of Cape York Peninsula, and was established in 1867. The town that developed on the island was also called Port Kennedy, but on 1 June 1962 the town was renamed Thursday Island.

In 1877, an administrative centre for the Torres Strait Islands was set up on the island by the Queensland Government and by 1883 over 200 pearling vessels were based on the island.

=== Pearl trade ===
A lucrative pearling industry was founded on the island in 1884, attracting workers from around Asia, including Japan, Malaya and India, seeking their fortune. The Japanese community was in part indentured divers and boat hands who returned to Japan after a period of service and some longer term residents who were active in boat building and in the ownership of luggers for hire—which was illegal but bypassed by leases through third parties back to other Japanese, a practice called &quot;dummying&quot;. Additionally, many south Pacific Islanders worked in the industry, with some originally imported against their will, in a practice known as blackbirding. While the pearling industry has declined in importance, the mix of cultures is evident to this day. The pearling industry centred on the harvesting of pearl shell, which was used mainly to make shirt buttons. The local pearl oyster is Golden Lip Oyster, &quot;Pinctada maxima&quot;.

=== Shell trade ===
Trochus shell was also gathered using specialized boats. Most shell was exported as the raw material—to a London-based market. Pearls themselves were rare and a bonus for the owner or crew. The boats used were very graceful two-masted luggers. In shallow water free diving was used while in deeper water diver&#x27;s dress, or an abbreviated form of it, with a surface air supply was used. In good times there were three divers to a lugger, a stern diver, one midships, and one diver off the bow. A manual air compressor was used. It looked like a yard-wide cube with two large wheels mounted one on each side.

For part of the fleet that operated further from Thursday Island, larger vessels, typically schooners were used as mother ships to the luggers. Shell was usually opened on the mother vessels rather than on the luggers, in order to secure any pearls found. The waters of the Straits are murky and visibility was generally very poor. Even though dive depths were not great, except at the Darnley Deep (near Darnley or Erub Island), which was 40 fathoms (240 feet), attacks of the bends were common and deaths frequent.

=== Telegraph, trade, and cyclone ===
The Thursday Island Parish of the Roman Catholic Vicariate Apostolic of Cooktown (now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cairns) was established in 1884.

On 25 August 1887, The Paterson (Cape York) Telegraph Station on the West Coast of Cape York was opened. It connected the Cape York Telegraph Line with Thursday Island, via an undersea cable.

In the late-19th and early-20th centuries Thursday Island was a regular stop for vessels trading between the east coast of Australia and Southeast Asia. A shipping disaster to a vessel in this service occurred in 1890 when struck an uncharted reef in the Strait and sank in five minutes with the loss of over 130 lives. The Anglican Church on Thursday Island built shortly afterwards was named the Quetta All Souls Memorial Cathedral in memory of the event. Today the church is called All Souls and St Bartholomew Church.

Cyclone Mahina, which hit Bathurst Bay, southeast of Thursday Island in 1899, wrecked the pearling fleet sheltering there, with huge losses of vessels and lives.

=== Fort ===

The fear of Russian invasion as a result of the deterioration of relations between the Russian Empire and the British Empire led to a fort on Battery Point being built in 1892 to protect the island. The fort has not been in operation since 1927, but is today a heritage feature of the island.

=== Twentieth century ===
Local pearling declined steadily up to World War II, partly through competition from a Japanese-based fleet which did not use local resources or personnel. In the 1950s plastic buttons imitating pearl supplanted much of the demand for shell. Before the decline, pearl fishing was taken by the island-based fleet to the Aru Islands in what was then the Dutch East Indies.

The Thursday Island Customs House opened in 1938 at 2 Victoria Parade ().

During World War II, Thursday Island became the military headquarters for the Torres Strait and was a base for Australian and United States forces. January 1942 saw the evacuation of civilians from the island. Residents of Japanese origin or descent were interned. The residents did not return until after the end of the war and many ethnic Japanese were forcibly repatriated. The island was spared from bombing in World War II, due, it was thought, to it being the burial place of many Japanese pearl shell divers, or possibly the Japanese thinking there were still Japanese residents on the island. However, neighbouring Horn Island was extensively bombed. There was an airbase there, used by the Allies to attack parts of New Guinea. At the end of the war, the island tradition of a no-footwear policy was reinstated out of respect for the ancient spirits believed to reside on the island. After the war, an airline service was set up by Ansett Airlines from Cairns to TI twice a week, using de Havilland Dragon Rapides and later DC3s. Passengers disembarked on Horn Island and caught a ferry-boat over to TI, as they still do. The island was also served by a ship, the &quot;Elsana&quot;, which made the journey once a month. For a short period after the war Okinawan divers were used on the luggers but this was not a great success. 

In the 1950s, the CSIRO attempted to establish cultured pearl farms, but many were devastated by disease in the 1970s. The trigger is considered by some to be the use of dispersants on the 1970 oil spill from the tanker &quot;Oceanic Grandeur&quot;. This industry still exists around the island today. In the 1970s, there was also an attempt to farm green turtles.

The Melanesian background of the Thursday Islanders became an issue in the 1970s, when Papua New Guinea sought to include some of the Torres Strait Islands within its borders. The Torres Strait Islanders insisted that they were Australians, however, and after considerable diplomatic discussion and political disputation between the Queensland and the Federal Governments, all of the Torres Strait islands, including Thursday Island, remained part of Australia.

From 1900 to 1996 the Quetta Memorial Church on the island was the cathedral church of the large Diocese of Carpentaria which included North Queensland, the Islands of the Torres Strait and, to 1968, Northern Territory.

== Heritage listings ==

Thursday Island has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Green Hill Fort, Chester Street
*Quetta Memorial Precinct, Douglas Street
* Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Church, 120 Douglas Street
* Thursday Island Cemetery (incorporating the Japanese Cemetery and the Grave of the Hon. John Douglas), Summers Street
* Thursday Island Customs House, 2 Victoria Parade

The Gab Titui Cultural Centre (2004) on Thursday Island showcases both heritage and contemporary Islander artworks.

== Economy ==
The Island is one of the two bases for the Torres Straits Pilots, a cooperative owned and run by qualified Master Mariners who pilot ships through the Straits and down to Cairns. This is a necessary service because navigation through the area is tricky due to the extensive reef systems.

The island has the area hospital and courts, is the regional centre for higher education, a centre for some research organisations and is the administrative base for the local, state and federal governments.
Banking and phones are available.

Thursday Island is only in part self-sufficient for water, some being piped from the adjacent island. It has two wind turbines which generate some of its electricity requirement.

The economy of the island is dependent on its role as an administrative centre and is supported by pearling and fishing, as well as a fast-developing tourism industry, with perhaps the most famous tourists being novelist Somerset Maugham and Banjo Paterson, and the most numerous being day-trippers from the cruise ships that call into the island each year.

== Climate ==
Climate data for Thursday Island was sourced from Horn Island, which is 8.7 km ENE of Thursday Island. Thursday Island has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: Aw), with a wet season from December to April and a dry season from May to November. Temperatures remain hot year-round, with average maxima ranging from in July to in November. Average annual rainfall is , with a late summer maximum. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 8 December 2002 to on 8 September 2019.

== Language ==
Torres Strait Creole is the dominant language spoken on Thursday Island by the Islanders, followed by Kalaw Lagaw Ya, commonly called Mabuiag (pronounced Mobyag) by many, although English is also spoken. The indigenous language is Kaiwaligau Ya, another dialect of Kalaw Lagaw Ya, otherwise known as Kowrareg, (or more correctly Kauraraigau Ya, the name used by the people in the mid to late 1800s).

== Amenities ==
Thursday Island has number of services open to the community, including a sporting complex, gym, public library as well as ANZAC park and Ken Brown Oval.

There is a community pharmacy, general store, butcher, bank and many other essential services.

The Shire of Torres operates Ngulaig Meta Municipal public library at 121 Douglas Street. The current library facility opened in 2015.

Sacred Heart Catholic Church is in Douglas Street. It is within the Thursday Island Parish of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cairns.

== Education ==
Tagai State College is a government primary and secondary (Early Childhood to Year 12) school for boys and girls that operates 17 campuses throughout the Torres Strait, including two on Thursday Island. The Thursday Island primary school campus (Early Childhood to Year 6) is at 31 Hargrave Street (). The Thursday Island secondary school campus (7-12) is at 21 Aplin Road () In 2017, the school across all location had a total enrolment of 1,554 students with 168 teachers (165 full-time equivalent) and 198 non-teaching staff (142 full-time equivalent). The school includes a special education program at Summers Street ().

Our Lady of the Sacred Heart School is a Catholic primary (Prep–6) school for boys and girls at Normanby Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 103 students with 12 teachers (9 full-time equivalent) and 13 non-teaching staff (9 full-time equivalent).

The Torres Strait Campus of the Tropical North Queensland TAFE Institute is located on the island next to the Tagai State College.

<doc id="624395" wikidata="Q790596" url="?curid=624395" title="Common bulbul">
<text>The common bulbul (Pycnonotus barbatus) is a member of the bulbul family of passerine birds. It is found in north-eastern, northern, western and central Africa.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The common bulbul was originally described in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot;. Some authorities treat the Somali, Dodson&#x27;s and dark-capped bulbul as subspecies of the common bulbul. The common bulbul is considered to belong to a superspecies along with the Himalayan bulbul, white-eared bulbul, white-spectacled bulbul, African red-eyed bulbul, and the Cape bulbul. Alternate names for the common bulbul include the black-eyed bulbul, brown bulbul (also used for the Asian red-eyed bulbul), brown-capped geelgat, common garden bulbul, garden bulbul and white-vented bulbul as well as one name used for another species (yellow-vented bulbul).

===Subspecies===
A number of subspecies are recognized:

==Description==
The bill is fairly short and thin, with a slightly downwards curving upper mandible. The bill, legs, and feet are black and the eye is dark brown with a dark eye-ring, which is not readily visible. It is about in length, with a long tail. It has a dark brown head and upperparts. Sexes are similar in plumage.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is a common resident breeder in much of Africa, and it has recently been found breeding in southern Spain at Tarifa. It is found in woodland, coastal bush, forest edges, riverine bush, montane scrub, and in mixed farming habitats. It is also found in exotic thickets, gardens, and parks.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The common bulbul is usually seen in pairs or small groups. It is a conspicuous bird, which tends to sit at the top of a bush. As with other bulbuls they are active and noisy birds. The flight is bouncing and woodpecker-like. The call is a loud &quot;doctor-quick doctor-quick be-quick be-quick&quot;.

===Breeding===
This species nests throughout the year in the moist tropics, elsewhere it is a more seasonal breeder with a peak in breeding coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The nest is fairly rigid, thick-walled and cup-shaped. It is usually situated inside the leafy foliage of a small tree or shrub.

Two or three eggs are a typical clutch. Like other bulbuls, it is parasitised by the Jacobin cuckoo.

===Feeding===
This species eats fruit, nectar, seeds and insects.

<text>Cornell Luther Dupree (December 19, 1942 – May 8, 2011) was an American jazz and R&amp;B guitarist. He worked at various times with Aretha Franklin, Bill Withers, Donny Hathaway, King Curtis, and Steve Gadd, appeared on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, and wrote a book on soul and blues guitar, &quot;Rhythm and Blues Guitar&quot;. He reportedly recorded on 2,500 sessions.

==Biography==

Dupree was born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas, where he graduated from I.M. Terrell High School. He began his career playing in the studio band for Atlantic Records, recording albums by Aretha Franklin (&quot;Aretha Live at Fillmore West&quot;) and King Curtis as a member of Curtis&#x27;s band The King Pins (Dupree grew up with Curtis in Fort Worth). He appeared on the 1969 Lena Horne and Gábor Szabó recording &quot;Lena &amp; Gabor&quot; and on recordings with Archie Shepp, Grover Washington Jr., Snooky Young, and Miles Davis.

Dupree played guitar on Brook Benton&#x27;s hit &quot;Rainy Night in Georgia&quot; in 1970. In December 1972, the British music magazine &quot;New Musical Express&quot; reported that Dupree, Roberta Flack, and Jerry Jemmott were injured in an auto accident in Manhattan. Dupree appeared on Joe Cocker&#x27;s albums &quot;Stingray&quot; and &quot;Luxury You Can Afford&quot;. He also released solo albums such as &quot;Teasin&quot;&#x27; (1974), &quot;Cornell Dupree&#x27;s Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977), &quot;Shadow Dancing&quot; (1978), &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; (1988), &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Through&quot; (1991), &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; (1993), &quot;Bop &#x27;n&#x27; Blues&quot; (1995), and &quot;Uncle Funky&quot; (1998). 

Dupree and other East Coast jazz fusion musicians played on Van McCoy&#x27;s hit 1975 single &quot;The Hustle&quot;. In the late 1970s, Dupree formed the new jazz fusion group Stuff with Eric Gale, Richard Tee, Steve Gadd, Chris Parker, and Gordon Edwards. Dupree and Tee recorded together on many occasions. 

In 1989, Cornell recorded a video for guitar teacher Arlen Roth called &quot;Mastering R&amp;B Guitar&quot;, which documented his style, technique, and influences. 

In 2002, Yamaha produced a signature guitar called the Cornell Dupree Model. Dupree appeared in the 2009 documentary entitled &quot;Still Bill&quot;, about the life of soul legend Bill Withers. He appeared in the film on stage playing a guitar-led version of Withers&#x27; single &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Hands&quot;; Withers, at first sitting in the audience, ultimately joins Dupree on stage to sing the song. The scene also shows Dupree playing guitar on a stool while breathing with an oxygen tank, foreshadowing his battles with emphysema.

Dupree died on May 8, 2011, at his home in Fort Worth, Texas. He had been waiting for a lung transplant as a result of emphysema.

<text>The Musconetcong River is a tributary of the Delaware River in northwestern New Jersey in the United States. It flows through the rural mountainous country of northwestern New Jersey. The name derives from the Lenape words &quot;moschakgeu&quot; meaning &quot;clear&quot; and &quot;hannek&quot; meaning &quot;stream&quot;. Part of it is a National Wild and Scenic River.
It rises out of Lake Hopatcong, on the border between the borough of Hopatcong in Sussex County and the township of Roxbury in Morris County. It flows through Lake Musconetcong, then flows southwest, through Hackettstown, past Stephensburg and New Hampton, passing south of Washington then along the southeastern side of the Pohatcong Mountain ridge. It joins the Delaware at Riegelsville, approximately 10 mi (16 km) south of Phillipsburg.

The river does not flow through any large population center and has been the site of relatively little industrial development throughout its history. In the 18th century, the surrounding hills were largely deforested as a source of charcoal for the iron industry in the surrounding region. The local industry declined by the middle of the 19th century after the building of the former Morris Canal, the course of which ran along the upper river, to bring coal from Pennsylvania to northern New Jersey. After the demise of the canal from the introduction of railroads in the late 19th century, the dam pools along the river that supplied the canal became the site of a popular summer cottage industry. Silted remnants of the pools, as well as the remnants of the canal itself, can still be seen along the river.

Human habitation in the Musconetcong Valley can be traced back approximately 12,000 years to the end of the last ice age. The Plenge Site along the lower river in Warren County was the first of only two major Paleo-Indian archaeological site excavations in New Jersey, and is considered one of the most significant in the northeastern United States.

The USGS stream flow gauge at Bloomsbury has the river&#x27;s flows recorded from as far back as 1904. The average flow over the time recorded for the gauge at Bloomsbury is approximately 244 cfs. Record flows of the river were recorded in 2011 as result of Hurricane Irene.

According to an urban legend, the river is also home to a creature known as the Musconetcong River Mantis Man, a somewhat humanoid, somewhat insect-like creature.

<doc id="624406" wikidata="Q903999" url="?curid=624406" title="Amagat's law">
<text>Amagat&#x27;s law or the law of partial volumes describes the behaviour and properties of mixtures of ideal (as well as some cases of non-ideal) gases. It is of use in chemistry and thermodynamics. It is named after Emile Amagat.

==Overview==
Amagat&#x27;s law states that the extensive volume of a gas mixture is equal to the sum of volumes of the component gases, if the temperature and the pressure remain the same:

formula_1

This is the experimental expression of volume as an extensive quantity.

According to Amagat&#x27;s law of partial volume, the total volume of a non-reacting mixture of gases at constant temperature and pressure should be equal to the sum of the individual partial volumes of the constituent gases. So if formula_2 are considered to be the partial volumes of components in the gaseous mixture, then the total volume would be represented as

:formula_3

Both Amagat&#x27;s and Dalton&#x27;s law predict the properties of gas mixtures. Their predictions are the same for ideal gases. However, for real (non-ideal) gases, the results differ. Dalton&#x27;s law of partial pressures assumes that the gases in the mixture are non-interacting (with each other) and each gas independently applies its own &quot;pressure&quot;, the sum of which is the total pressure. Amagat&#x27;s law assumes that the &quot;volumes&quot; of the component gases (again at the same temperature and pressure) are additive; the interactions of the different gases are the same as the average interactions of the components.

The interactions can be interpreted in terms of a second virial coefficient for the mixture. For two components, the second virial coefficient for the mixture can be expressed as

formula_4

where the subscripts refer to components 1 and 2, the are the mole fractions, and the are the second virial coefficients. The cross term of the mixture is given by

:formula_5 for Dalton&#x27;s law

and

:formula_6 for Amagat&#x27;s law.

When the &quot;volumes&quot; of each component gas (same temperature and pressure) are very similar, then Amagat&#x27;s law becomes mathematically equivalent to Vegard&#x27;s law for solid mixtures.

==Ideal gas mixture==

When Amagat&#x27;s law is valid &quot;and&quot; the gas mixture is made of ideal gases,

:formula_7

where:
: formula_8 is the pressure of the gas mixture,
: formula_9 is the volume of the &quot;i&quot;-th component of the gas mixture,
: formula_10 is the total volume of the gas mixture,
: formula_11 is the amount of substance of &quot;i&quot;-th component of the gas mixture (in mol),
: formula_12 is the total amount of substance of gas mixture (in mol),
: formula_13 is the ideal, or universal, gas constant, equal to the product of the Boltzmann constant and the Avogadro constant,
: formula_14 is the absolute temperature of the gas mixture (in K),
: formula_15 is the mole fraction of the &quot;i&quot;-th component of the gas mixture.

It follows that the mole fraction and volume fraction are the same. This is true also for other equation of state.

<doc id="624408" wikidata="Q160096" url="?curid=624408" title="Geranium robertianum">
<text>Geranium robertianum, commonly known as herb-robert, or (in North America) Robert&#x27;s geranium, is a species of cranesbill that is widespread throughout the northern hemisphere and introduced to some countries in the southern. It is common in woods, hedges, gardens, and on waste ground, and can also be found on shingle beaches and limestone pavements. It is not rare or threatened, but in some places, it is considered to be invasive.

==Description==

Herb-robert is a small, usually biennial but sometimes annual or even short-lived perennial herb that typically grows to about 30 cm (1 ft) tall and broad, or sometimes up to about twice that size. Young plants have a very short vegetative stem with effectively a basal rosette of leaves on long (2-5 cm) petioles, while older plants put up flowering stems from the axils of one or more of these basal leaves. The flowering stems can arise vertically or sprawl along the ground, and some of them can turn into stolons by putting down roots at the nodes. The whole plant is variously hairy, with a mixture of long simple hairs and shorter gland-tipped ones. Fresh material has a strong unpleasant odour when bruised or uprooted, but this property fades with time. Its colour can vary from entirely green, to reddish at the nodes or on the stems or leaves, or the whole plant (except the petals) can be bright red, especially when growing in bright sunshine.
The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, and are typically divided into three stalked lobes, the lower two of which are further split to produce a 5-lobed (palmate) outline, up to about 11 cm in diameter in the largest, lower leaves. The leaflets are deeply lobed and toothed, with a short mucronate tip on each lobe.
Flowering occurs from early spring to late autumn in northern Europe and plants remain green over winter. The inflorescence is on a long peduncle, which arises opposite a leaf on the flowering stem, and consists of a pair of bisexual pink flowers, 12-16 mm in diameter, on short (1 cm) pedicels. Often one of the two flowers in a pair will be abortive. The five sepals are about 5 mm long, lanceolate and coated with both pink-tipped glandular and eglandular hairs. The petals are from 8 to 14 mm long, purplish-pink with white stripes, and with the claw (stalk-like basal part) slightly shorter than the limb. There is no notch in the top of the petals, unlike in some other geraniums. There are 10 stamens in two rings of 5 that project slightly beyond the flower, with purple anthers and yellow pollen; the inner ring of anthers opens first. The female part of the flower consists of 5 carpels with one style, which is divided into 5 pink stigmas at the top. These are already spread when the flower opens, which facilitates self-pollination, although cross-pollination also occurs.
The fruit is a schizocarp, which splits into 5 cylindrical, 2.5 mm long, mericarps on maturity. These are situated at the base of the style, the base of which (the column) elongates to about 1.5 cm as the fruit develops. Connecting the tip of the style to the mericarp is a strip of material called an awn. When the fruit is ripe, the awn curls upwards explosively from the base, ejecting the fruits a distance of a metre of so from the parent plant.
==Identification==
Other cranesbills that look rather similar include shining cranesbill, which has lobed but undivided leaves, and long-stalked cranesbill, which has long points on the sepals. It is very similar in appearance to little robin but that species has smaller flowers (5-9 mm), yellow anthers, and no smell.

In Britain, in particular, it can be very difficult to separate herb-robert from little robin in coastal locations; various varieties and hybrids have been described. Key features to look out for include the ridges on the ripe mericarps (less pronounced than in little robin), the petals being twice as long as the sepals (just slightly longer in little robin), the hairiness of the leaves (glabrous in little robin). The petals of little robin are always purple and do not have white stripes.

==Taxonomy==
The scientific name was assigned by Linnaeus in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; volume 2, p. 681 (1753), and it has not changed since then; but it was not original. Linnaeus cites Bauhin as having used the polynomial &quot;Geranium robertianum primum&quot; it in his &quot;Pinax theatri botanici&quot; in 1623. Bauhin, in turn, credited it to Dodoens, who listed &quot;Geranium robertianum&quot; in his &quot;Stirpium historiae&quot; in 1554 (vol. 1, p. 62). But Dodoens got the name from Ruellius who published &quot;De natura stirpium&quot; (&quot;On the nature of species&quot;) in 1543, which was largely a translation of Dioscorides&#x27;s &quot;De materia medica&quot;. In this, there is just one type of &quot;geranion&quot;, which is described as having heads like a crane&#x27;s &quot;horn&quot;, and may have been what we now call a geranium. The name &quot;Robertiana herba&quot; may therefore have first been used by Ruellius, as it is not in Dioscorides.

The generic name comes from the Ancient Greek word for the plant, (&quot;géranion&quot;), which comes from (&quot;géranos&quot;) &#x27;crane&#x27; with the diminutive ending -ιον, &quot;little crane&quot;. This was also used by the Romans. It refers to the beak-like shape of the style in fruit.

There are many synonyms, most of them having arisen as descriptions of varieties or subspecies. These are not widely accepted now. A full list is given in Plants of the World Online. Some experts, however, do still recognise various forms. Sell &amp; Murrell, for example, describe three subspecies in Britain:
* subsp. &quot;celticum&quot; , a green-coloured annual with pale flowers, found on limestone in the west;
* subsp. &quot;maritimum&quot; , a prostrate red biennial with dark flowers, found on shingle beaches;
* subsp. &quot;robertianum&quot;, the common form found inland.

&quot;Geranium robertianum&quot; has generally been found to have a chromosome number of 2n = 64, although there has been a count of 2n = 32. The closely related &quot;Geranium purpureum&quot; has a chromosome number 2n = 32, and there has been speculation that this species may be an ancestor of herb-robert. The two species have been found to hybridise on beaches in south-west Britain and Ireland to produce largely infertile offspring with a chromosome number 2n = 48. This hybrid has not been recorded elsewhere in Europe.

==Distribution and status==
The main areas of distribution of herb-robert are throughout Europe northwards to the Baltic and eastwards as far as Russia. It also occurs in north Africa and it is considered also to be native in north America, although in some western states it is regarded as a weed.
It grows at altitudes from sea level to 700 m at Great Dun Fell in England and up to 2,400 m in Kashmir.

The IUCN has not assessed the threat status of this species, but in some countries it is classified as Least Concern.

==Habitat and ecology==
Its Ellenberg values in Britain are L=5, N=6, F=6, R=6 and S=0, which means that it typically grows in places with light shade, moist neutral soils with moderate fertility and no salinity. However, it can occupy a wide range of habitats, including shingle beaches in full sun and grikes in limestone pavements. Despite these neutral-sounding values, it is primarily a plant of woodland, and it is quite tolerant of at least moderate shade. It is also much more of a calcicole than a calcifuge, being most common in limestone and chalk woodlands, and absent from many acid habitats. The most typical vegetation communities for it in Britain include ash woods and hawthorn hedges.
In Europe there are 52 habitats in which it is found. In two of these it is a diagnostic species. Under the EUNIS habitat system these are: T1-F &quot;Forêts de ravin&quot; (ravine forests) and T1-G &quot;Aulnaies à Alnus cordata&quot; (Italian alder carr). It is also considered characteristic of E5.43 shady forest edges, F3.11 Central European thickets on moist soils, H2.6C Illyrian sub-Mediterranean screes, and G1.7A1212 Pannonic alkali steppe oak woods. A re-evaluation of its ecological attributes in Switzerland assigned it the following Ellenberg Values: L=3, N=4, F=3, R=6, T=3+ and K=3.

The British database of insects and foodplants lists nine species which are phytophagous on herb-robert. Most feed on the leaves: the beetle &quot;Aphthona nigriceps&quot;, the meadow cranesbill weevil &quot;Zacladus geranii&quot;, the larvae of the weevil &quot;Limobius borealis&quot;, the bugs &quot;Dicyphus errans&quot; and &quot;Rhopalus subrufus&quot;, and the aphid &quot;Acyrthosiphon malvae&quot;. Of the others, the beetle &quot;Byturus ochraceus&quot; eats the pollen; the bloody cranesbill weevil &quot;Zacladus exiguus&quot; eats the roots; and the larvae of the sawfly &quot;Ametastegia&quot; (&quot;Protoemphytus&quot;) &quot;carpini&quot; mine the leaves. 
In Europe there are many more species of insect associated with it.

==Uses and in culture==
White-flowered varieties of herb-robert have been cultivated in gardens for centuries. A small-flowered, fragrant white variety, &#x27;Celtic White&#x27;, is currently a popular garden plant.
Folk etymology provides several possible origins of the name of herb-robert. Some claim it is from St Rupert, who is also known as Saint Robert, because a German name for it is ruprechtskraut (another, more prosaic one is Stinkender Storchschnabel). Alternatively, a link to Saint Robert of Molesme has been proposed. Another explanation is that it could be derived from Robin Goodfellow, a hobgoblin in northern European mythology. In Britain there are dozens of other country names for herb-robert, some of which (&quot;robin-in-the-hedge&quot;, &quot;robin&#x27;s-flower&quot;) make reference to the European robin because of the colour and the habitat.

The medicinal value of herb-robert is uncertain. Maud Grieve, for example, did not mention it at all in her influential herbal, but there are other accounts of it being used in the folk medicine of several countries, including as a treatment for diarrhea, to improve functioning of the liver and gallbladder, for toothache and nosebleeds, and as a vulnerary (used for or useful in healing wounds). Freshly picked leaves, when rubbed on the body, are said to repel mosquitoes.

Chemical constituents include tannins, a bitter compound called geraniin, and essential oils. Some researchers have reported potentially useful medicinal properties in plant extracts.

<text>Francisca Edwiges Neves Gonzaga, better known as Chiquinha Gonzaga (; October 17, 1847 – February 28, 1935) was a Brazilian composer, pianist and the first woman conductor in Brazil.

Chiquinha Gonzaga was the first pianist of &quot;choro&quot; and author of the first carnival march, &quot;Ó Abre Alas&quot; (1899). Her plays and operettas, such as &quot;Forrobodó&quot; and &quot;Jurití&quot;, were a great success with the public because they used elements of Brazilian popular culture of the time.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Chiquinha Gonzaga was born in Rio de Janeiro, from a pardo mother and a wealthy white father – after she was born her father became a marshal. Her godfather was Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, Duke of Caxias. For her mother, a mestizo and poor woman, the birth of Chiquinha was a very difficult, in part because of the risk that the father would not recognize the paternity of her daughter. Indeed, José Basileu, the military promising career, from a wealthy family, suffered from the pressure of his parents, who were against his marriage with Rosa. Despite these disagreements, he accepted the child as his daughter and married.

Like all girls of a military family in the 19th century, Chiquinha Gonzaga was very well educated. Her father, very strict with her education, prepared her for a successful future: a good marriage that would raise her to the category of &quot;lady&quot;. She learned to read and write, do maths and primarily play the piano. Therefore, the music became her sole purpose in life. At age 11, she composed her first musical work, the song &quot;Canção dos Pastores&quot;, in a Christmas celebration.

In Brazil in the late 19th century, women were often seen on a quasi role of slave; few dared to defy their parents and husbands; when that happened, they were quickly sent to reformatories and convents. However, since 1808 with the arrival of the Royal Family in Brazil, women began to circulate more in the streets, dancing in receptions, to come to parties at theater and opera.

Rio de Janeiro in those times was already turning into a metropolitan center, gradually growing according to the development of external trade. The usages and consumption were modified. The port of Rio de Janeiro became the financial and commercial center of the Empire, which were trading coffee, slaves and foreign goods that fascinated the new consumers. The city now had the appearance of a European city. Even with all these social changes, manners were not so advanced. For the young Chiquinha, nothing had changed: she always had to obey the orders of her father.

=== Marriage and family ===
In 1863, at age 16, Francisca married Jacinto Ribeiro do Amaral, a young man of 24 and an official of the Imperial Navy. Francisca had received the gift of a piano from her father, as a wedding gift. Jacinto do Amareal was chosen by her father to marry Chiquinha even though she had expressed her disagreement with this arranged marriage.

Unable to withstand the life on the ship where her husband served (and where he spent more time than with his family), his psychological and physical abuses and humiliation, because he did not agree that she would pursue a musical career, Chiquinha left her husband and asked for divorce, a scandal at the time. She took with her their eldest son, João Gualberto (born in 1864). Her husband, however, did not let Chiquinha take her younger children: their daughter, Maria do Patrocínio (born in 1865) and their other son, Hilário (born in 1867).

After leaving her husband, Chiquinha was “declared dead and of unpronounceable name” by her father.

In 1870, Chiquinha moved to Minas Gerais with the engineer João Batista de Carvalho, with whom she had a daughter, Maria Alice (born in 1876). As Chiquinha could not accept his extra-marital betrayals, she split and again lost a daughter. João Batista did not let Chiquinha keep Maria Alice.

In 1876, Chiquinha Gonzaga, 29 years old, lived in Rio de Janeiro with her eldest son, João Gualberto, to work as an independent musician and initiate her successful career as a pianist and composer.

In 1899, after decades dedicated mainly to her music, Chiquinha met João Batista Fernandes Lage, a young Portuguese musician. They fell in love but the age difference was too large and would cause more prejudice and suffering in the life of Chiquinha. She was 52 years old and João Batista Fernandes Lage was only 16. Chiquinha adopted him as a son in order to be able to live this great love. This decision was taken to avoid the scandals regarding her own children and the society of the time, and to not affect her brilliant career. For this reason also, Chiquinha and João Batista moved to Lisbon (Portugal) where they lived several years away from the acquaintances in Rio de Janeiro. At first, her children did not accept the couple, but soon they realized the importance of João Batista for Chiquinha&#x27;s music and life. After a few years, the couple returned to Brazil without arousing any suspicions to be living as husband and wife. Chiquinha never admitted publicly her relationship with João Batista, which was only discovered after his death, through letters and photos of the couple.

She died in 1935, during the beginning of a new Carnival. She was buried in the cemetery of São Francisco de Paula, district of Catumbi, in Rio de Janeiro.

== Career ==
After separating from her husband, Chiquinha lived as an independent musician, playing piano in music instrument stores. She gave piano lessons to support her son João Gualberto, regardless of society critics because she was raising a child without a husband. She was devoted entirely to her music, which was very successful, as her career grew and she became very famous as a composer of polkas, waltzes, tangos and ditties. Chiquinha began to participate in balls and “&quot;chorões&quot;” reunions, normally reserved for men, where she met the flautist Joaquim Antônio da Silva Callado and started to play in his group, &quot;O Choro do Calado&quot;, being the first woman to play in this group.

The need to adjust the piano sound to popular taste are the reason of Chiquinha Gonzaga&#x27;s glory to become the first popular composer of Brazil. During this time she composed her first success, the polka &quot;Atraente&quot;&quot;&quot;, in 1877, “&quot;composed by the piano, as an improvisation, during a ‘choro’ meeting&quot;”. At that time, she was famous but highly criticized by the masculine society of her time. In 1884, she composed the waltz &quot;Walkyria&quot;, considered one of her most beautiful waltzes.

After the success of her first printed composition, she decided to start to do vaudeville and revue. She composed the costume operetta &quot;A Corte na Roça&quot; in 1885. In 1911, her greatest success in the theater was the operetta &quot;Forrobodó&quot;, that reached 1500 straight shows after the premiere - until today the best show of its kind in Brazil.

In 1900, Chiquinha meets the irreverent artist Nair de Tefé von Hoonholtz, the first woman cartoonist in the world, a bohemian woman from noble family, and they become great friends. Between 1902 and 1910, Chiquinha travelled through Europe, becoming particularly famous in Portugal, where she wrote songs for various authors.

Shortly after her return from Europe, her friend Nair de Tefé married the Brazilian president Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca, becoming the first lady of Brazil. Chiquinha was invited by Nair de Tefé a few evenings at Catete Palace, the presidential palace, even against the will of Nair&#x27;s family. Chiquinha was already very famous but very criticized by the society of her time. Once, in 1914, for the premiere of &quot;Corta Jaca&quot; at the presidential palace, the first lady joined Chiquinha on guitar, playing an excerpt from the song composed by the pianist. This episode was considered a scandal at the time, with public critics against the government, the life at the palace, the promotion and dissemination of music whose origins were in &quot;vulgar&quot; dances, contrary to the values of the aristocratic social elite. Playing Brazilian popular music in the palace of the Brazilian Government was regarded at the time as a violation of the protocol, which caused controversy in the upper echelons of society and politicians. After the end of his presidential term, Hermes da Fonseca and Nair de Tefé moved to France, where they remained for a long time. Because of this episode, Chiquinha and Nair ended up losing touch.

She was the composer of the famous operetta partition &quot;Juriti&quot; with Viriato Corrêa, in 1919.

In 1934, at age 87, she wrote her last composition, the opera &quot;Maria&quot;.

Due to the popularity of her music, many people began to use her music and content without permission. Their abuse of her work as a musician led to Chiquinha founding the Brazilian Society of Theater Authors in 1917, which was the first society put into place to copyright and protect works by Brazilian artists.

By the end of her life, she composed music for 77 theater plays and was the author of about 2,000 compositions in different genres: waltzes, polkas, tangos, lundus, maxixes, Fado, quadrilles, mazurkas, Choros and serenades.

== Civic engagement ==
Due her maternal origins and the many injustices experienced during her life, Chiquinha was a very active citizen and involved in all kinds of social movements that took place during her generation in Brazil, such as the abolition of slavery, with the Law Áurea of 1888 and the proclamation of the Republic in 1889. Many times, she had a leading position for the suffragist movement.

==Tribute==
On 17 October 2018, to commemorate what would have been her 171st birthday, Google released a Google Doodle celebrating her.

In 1999, a miniseries titled Chiquinha Gonzaga was released. It comprised 38 episodes, and was based on her life as a teacher and composer.

In the Passeio Público of Rio de Janeiro, there is a herm in her honor by the sculptor Honorius Peçanha. In May 2012, law 12624 was enacted establishing the National Day of Brazilian Popular Music, celebrated on the day of her birthday, October 17.

<text>New Trier High School (, also known as New Trier Township High School or NTHS) is a public four-year high school whose main campus for sophomores through seniors is in Winnetka, Illinois, United States, with a campus in Northfield, Illinois, for first-year classes and district administration. Founded in 1901, the school serves the Chicago suburbs of Wilmette, Kenilworth, Winnetka, Glencoe, and Northfield, as well as parts of Northbrook, Glenview, and unincorporated Cook County. New Trier&#x27;s seal depicts the Porta Nigra, a symbol of Trier, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. The athletic teams are known as the Trevians, an archaic demonym for the people of Trier.

== History ==

New Trier High School opened on February 4, 1901, welcoming 76 students. In 1913, it became the first American high school with an indoor swimming pool.

The first edition of &quot;The New Trier News&quot; was published in 1920. In 1934, the track and field team won the school&#x27;s first IHSA state championship (as of 2023, New Trier leads all Illinois high schools in athletic state championships). In 1965, the New Trier West Campus (which, as of 2023, serves the school&#x27;s first-year students) opened in the village of Northfield.

In the 1950s, New Trier became the first U.S. high school with an educational, non-commercial FM broadcast license for a radiated station (WNTH, 88.1 FM). By 1970, New Trier was home to the nation&#x27;s first public high school-based CCTV instructional station, ITV, which broadcast educational programming to township elementary schools via microwave signals. Students operated WNTH under a faculty advisor, and ITV was run by students under professional television technical and programming staff.

By 1962, student enrollment was more than 4,000. Some 20 &quot;temporary&quot; trailer classrooms lined the rear of the building, which had been designed for 3,000. To accommodate the growing baby boomer student body, voters approved a referendum for New Trier to purchase 46 acres of land in Northfield. Chicago architecture firm Perkins and Will was selected to design a campus of curricular buildings clustered around a central library and administration building. The resulting modernist design was widely noted in secondary education architecture literature and practice and emulated by Winnetka&#x27;s Carleton Washburne junior high school several years later.

&quot;New Trier West&quot; opened to first- and second-year students in 1965. What had been &quot;New Trier&quot;, at 385 Winnetka Avenue in Winnetka, became &quot;New Trier East&quot;. In 1967, New Trier West was dedicated as a separate four-year high school. U.S. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare John Gardner keynoted the dedication, which was also attended by U.S. Senator Charles Percy (class of 1937) and Congressman Donald Rumsfeld (class of 1950).

Enrollment reached an all-time peak of 6,558 students in 1972. By 1981, enrollment had dropped significantly. As a result, the school board combined the East and West schools and converted New Trier West into a freshman-only campus. The division of first-year students (at the former New Trier West) from upper-level students (at the former New Trier East) lasted from 1981 to 1985. By then, enrollment had declined enough for the board to bring all students under one roof, close the former New Trier West, and convert the Northfield campus into a community recreation space. The campus later housed a senior center, corporate dormitories, a public swimming pool, and an alternative high school program known as West Center Academy.
The 1987-88 New Trier School Board proposed selling the New Trier West Campus in Northfield to facilitate a $10–12 million renovation project at the East Campus. Their decision to sell the property was based on a demographer&#x27;s report and a reluctance to raise property taxes to cover the NT East revamp. The demographer, however, expressed caution about relying on predictions that exceeded ten years, stating in part that &quot;. . .after 10 years, greater risk emerges of unanticipated events invalidating even the most scientifically-based projection methods.&quot; Concerned about another spike in (school) population and the need to retain the 42.5 acre Campus for future generations, local citizen advocates formed &quot;The Coalition for the Future of New Trier&quot;. In March 1988, the Coalition forced the issue to a referendum, which, backed by broad community support, successfully ratified the Coalition&#x27;s position. The Campus was retained and subsequently rented to various entities until it was again needed as additional space for a growing NT student population. According to research, the combined New Trier enrollment took less than two decades to exceed 4,000 students. The Coalition has never been acknowledged publicly for its significant role as a catalyst in retaining the 42.5-acre New Trier West Campus.

New Trier was featured in the December 9, 1996, issue of Time in an article entitled &quot;High Times at New Trier High.&quot; Among other claims, the article stated that &quot;New Trier kids who smoke pot&quot; were &quot;by all accounts more than three-fifths of the student body,&quot; compared with national averages at the time closer to 33%. However, on the school&#x27;s WNTH radio program, the writer acknowledged that the &quot;three-fifths&quot; claim had been inadvertently rewritten during the editing process in such a way that seemed to imply that more than 60% of New Trier students may be regular users of marijuana, whereas that figure should have been clearly labeled as the portion of students who had ever used marijuana, including many who had used it only once or twice 
In 2017, the school neared completion of a $104.9 million renovation and addition project at its East Campus, which replaced three aging buildings on the west side of the campus with the addition of a new student cafeteria, a new library, more than two dozen classrooms for core English, math, social studies, language and business program classes, new art labs, applied arts classroom spaces in the basement for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) programming, space for the school&#x27;s radio and broadcasting programming, two green roofs, and two new theaters.

Jonathan Kozol wrote a book called &quot;Savage Inequalities&quot; in 1991 that discussed the harsh conditions in the poorest school districts in the United States, making a correlation between inequality and racial separation and segregation. In the book, Kozol contrasted New Trier High School&#x27;s spending per student to impoverished schools within Chicago.

In 2016, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine ranked New Trier as the top open-enrollment high school in Illinois and the 17th best high school in the country.

=== Seminar Day and backlash ===
Every year, New Trier holds a seminar on a topic, with the 2021-2022 school year seminar on mental health. In 2017, New Trier held a Seminar day on race. There was significant backlash, especially from conservative publications. For example, the Wall Street Journal ran an article about the day titled &quot;It&#x27;s Racial Indoctrination Day at an Upscale Chicagoland School&quot;. It is now seen as the beginning to a backlash against so-called &quot;Critical Race Theory&quot; in education.

== Governance ==
, the New Trier Township High School Board of Education&#x27;s members are mostly from Glencoe and Wilmette. As of September 1, 2017, the current superintendent of New Trier Township High School District 203 is Dr. Paul Sally. He replaced Dr. Linda L. Yonke, the first woman to hold the position, at the end of June 2017.

== Admissions ==
In the 2021-22 academic year, New Trier had an enrollment of 2,995 students in grades 10-12 and a student-teacher ratio of 11.7 to 1. Most of the students come from middle or upper-class families, with 3% of students from poor households (measured by how many qualify for free/reduced-price lunch).

Most students identify as white (77 percent), while 10 percent are Asian, 7 percent are Hispanic, and 5 percent are multiracial. Less than one percent of the student body is Black, American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander.

On the freshman campus, were 894 students enrolled in 2021-22. The student-teacher ratio is somewhat lower, at 10.5 to 1. Demographically, the student body is similar to the main campus: 75 percent of students are white, 10 percent are Asian, 9 percent are Hispanic, and 6 percent are multiracial, with members of other groups accounting for less than 1 percent. Three percent of students come from households with income below the income threshold for subsidized school lunches.

== Curriculum ==
New Trier has practiced subject-level grouping for over fifty years. In this system, up to four different levels of difficulty are offered for each academic subject. Level 2E is considered a general level. Levels 2, 3 and 4 are college preparatory, honors, and high honors levels, respectively. Level 5 was reserved for Advanced Placement classes and other college-level classes, such as multivariable calculus and linear algebra, but the level was phased out beginning with the class of 2011. (All 5-level courses are currently counted as 4-level.) Students may work at different levels in different subjects. Other levels include 8 and 9. Level 8 classes are counted for elective credit and level 9 classes, a combination of level 2, 3, and 4 students (i.e. 2+3+4=9) are graded as level 3 classes.

New Trier offers unweighted and weighted grade point averages (GPA); plus and minus grades are reported on transcripts. In calculating a weighted GPA, grades in a student&#x27;s coursework are given different values depending on the level in which the grade is earned. For example, an &quot;A&quot; in a 2-level course is weighted at 4.00, while in levels 3 and 4, the values are 4.67 and 5.33, respectively (an &quot;A&quot; in a 5-level AP class is worth 5.67). In 2009, New Trier announced that for the 2010–2011 school year, the level 5 will be eliminated. A.P. classes will be weighted to level 4.

== Awards and recognition ==
In 2006, New Trier spent over $15,000 yearly per student, well above the then-state average of $8,786. It has been included in the &quot;Top Hundred&quot; and &quot;Most Successful&quot; lists of the National Association of Secondary School Principals, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;Parade&quot; magazine. The school was identified as &quot;quite possibly the best public school in America&quot; by &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot;, in a six-page article on New Trier that cited the &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;demanding&quot; curriculum, extensive arts and activities, strong participation in athletics, and faculty of the caliber typically found teaching at good colleges. &quot;Life&quot; also recognized New Trier as one of the best high schools in America with cover stories in 1950 and 1998.

In the class of 2017, 23 students were National Merit finalists, 27 were National Merit semifinalists, 71 received letters of commendation, and 442 were Illinois State Scholars. For this same class, the average composite ACT score was 27.8, the highest in Illinois for an open-enrollment public school and among the top school scores in the United States. The class of 2018 scored an average 28.0 composite on the ACT, the highest ever for New Trier and the highest in Illinois for open enrollment schools. According to an article by the University of Michigan Department of Psychology, &quot;New Trier students outperform their Illinois classmates on every conceivable measure.&quot; The article also points out that 92% of the school&#x27;s funding comes from the high property taxes of its affluent surroundings. Approximately 98% of the class of 2014 went on to enroll in college.

New Trier ensembles or individuals have received 39 awards in the Downbeat Student Music Awards program. A record-setting seven of these were achieved in 2007 alone. More than 1,100 students participate in the music department. The student-run Soundtraks Club produces all 24 concerts a year, webcast live on the internet at ntjazz.com, on local cable television, and in stereo on WNTH radio.

New Trier was named a Grammy Signature School Gold recipient by the Grammy Foundation in 2000 for its commitment to music education, and was named the National Signature School in 2007 as the nation&#x27;s top high school music program. In April 2006, the school&#x27;s Concert Choir and Symphony Orchestra performed in New York City at Carnegie Hall. In the summer of 2000, the school&#x27;s Jazz Ensemble, Chamber Orchestra, and Bluegrass Band enjoyed a successful two-week concert tour of China.

The team recently secured 8th place at the 2024 National Tournament after winning the state tournament. Having won state 16 times, New Trier has consistently demonstrated excellence, qualifying for the national tournament every year since 2002. Their record includes 22 consecutive top 2 finishes at the state level and 14 top 10 finishes at the national level.

===Lagniappe-Potpourri===
New Trier&#x27;s Lagniappe-Potpourri is an annual student-written, student-choreographed, student-composed, student-directed, student-managed, student-built, and student-performed variety show. The show began as two separate productions, Lagniappe and Potpourri, at the east and west campuses respectively. In 1981, the two campuses combined, causing the two shows to merge into Lagniappe-Potpourri.

=== Journalism ===
New Trier has several student publications, including the New Trier Political Journal, Calliope, the school&#x27;s art magazine and Logos, the school&#x27;s literary magazine.

===Debate===
New Trier&#x27;s debate program has flourished in recent years, with two students receiving the top speaker award at the Tournament of Champions, which only allows the top 72 teams in the nation to compete through a system of qualifiers. The school has also had teams placed in the top 16 in recent years. New Trier has had students either go to the final or win in the Illinois High School Association&#x27;s state debate tournament in all four divisions, winning the 2011 and 2013 championship in Public Forum. In 2017 they won the championship in Lincoln-Douglas debate.

===Philanthropy===
Each of the four official class governments (Sophomore and Junior Steering Committees and the Freshman and Senior Senates) makes significant annual donations to various philanthropic causes throughout the community, state, country, and world. Every year since 2001, the Senior Senate has fully funded the construction of a house in conjunction with Habitat for Humanity of Lake County, Illinois, a non-profit organization that fights homelessness and substandard housing. A recent goal of the campaign was ten houses in 10 years, and the class of 2010 fulfilled that goal. New Trier is the only school to build 10 houses with Habitat. Many fundraisers contribute to this and various other causes over the academic year. The New Trier Tsunami Relief Committee donated more than $18,000 to relief organizations to save people affected by the tsunami; it also helped victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004.

===Frank Mantooth Jazz Festival===
The jazz festival began in 1983 and takes place on the first Saturday of February. Each year, the event brings in around fifty high school and junior high jazz ensembles from the Great Lakes region and Canada to perform during the day. The high school groups attend clinics with jazz educators and composers nationwide. Seminars are also held throughout the day on improvisation, transcription, music business, and instrument masterclasses. A jazz combo and college big band perform in the afternoon, while the evening concert features New Trier&#x27;s top jazz ensemble and a professional big band. Past groups have included the Buddy Rich Big Band (led by Dave Weckl), the Woody Herman Orchestra, the Count Basie Orchestra, the Artie Shaw Orchestra, the Duke Ellington Orchestra, the Toshiko Akiyoshi-Lew Tabackin Jazz Orchestra, the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, the Chicago Jazz Ensemble (led by Jon Faddis), the Bob Mintzer Big Band, Gordon Goodwin&#x27;s Big Phat Band, the Mingus Big Band, Maynard Ferguson, Dizzy Gillespie, Delfeayo Marsalis, and Wynton Marsalis. The festival was renamed in 2005 after Frank Mantooth when the jazz musician, educator, and composer died just days before the 2004 festival.

==Local attractions==


Karuizawa was developed as a European-style resort town by a Scottish-Canadian missionary in 1888. In the following decades, the town attracted visitors from across the country seeking to escape the heat of summer and enjoy vacations, as well as a significant number of Westerners. Unlike many other hill stations, Karuizawa was actively open to the natives from the beginning, and many Japanese scholars, artists and others had already built &quot;Western-style&quot; villas in the town by the early 20th century. The Japanese and Western communities interacted well with each other through summer recreation activities and the like. In the 21st century the town retains significant Western cultural influence, and its alpine beauty and cool summer climate (similar to parts of Europe) continue to draw visitors.

More recently, Karuizawa has become a popular year-round resort for mainly Japanese, offering many outdoor sports, hot springs and recreational activities. Convenient road and rail access from central Tokyo has ensured Karuizawa&#x27;s popularity as a location for second homes and resort hotels since the Meiji era.

Karuizawa is known for its historic shopping street known as &quot;Ginza dōri&quot; or &quot;Kyū-dō&quot; (Ginza Street, or the Old Road) and association with both Japanese royalty and visitors such as John Lennon and Yoko Ono. As a side note, The Crown Prince Akihito met Michiko Shoda for the first time on a tennis court in Karuizawa in August 1957, and John Lennon spent several summers in Karuizawa with his family in the late 1970s.

Karuizawa hosted equestrian events in the 1964 Summer Olympics as well as curling in the 1998 Winter Olympics. It is the first city in the world to host both Summer and Winter Olympic events.

Since 1997, Karuizawa has been accessible via the JR East Nagano Shinkansen. New high speed rail links has resulted in modest population growth and the development of large outlet style shopping malls.

<text>In biology, a clasper is a male anatomical structure found in some groups of animals, used in mating.
Male cartilaginous fish have claspers formed from the posterior portion of their pelvic fin which serve to channel semen into the female&#x27;s cloaca during mating. The act of mating in some fish including sharks usually includes one of the claspers raised to allow water into the siphon through a specific orifice. The clasper is then inserted into the cloaca, where it opens like an umbrella to anchor its position. The siphon then begins to contract, expelling water and sperm. The claspers of many shark species have spines or hooks, which may hold them in place during copulation. Many male holocephalans, including living chimaeras have cephalic claspers (tenacula) on their heads, which are thought to aid in holding the female during mating. 

In entomology, it is a structure in male insects that is used to hold the female during copulation (see Lepidoptera genitalia for more).

<text>Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina (, born 3 September 1948, Rostov-on-Don) is an astronomer and discoverer of minor planets.

In 1978 she began as a staff astronomer of the Institute for Theoretical Astronomy (ITA) at Leningrad. Her research at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory (CrAO) then focused on astrometry and photometry of minor planets. The Minor Planet Center credits her with the discovery of 130 minor planets, including the Amor asteroid 5324 Lyapunov and the Trojan asteroid 3063 Makhaon. In 2004, she received a Ph.D. in astronomy from Odesa I. I. Mechnikov National University.

Lyudmila Karachkina has two daughters, Maria and Renata. The inner main-belt asteroid 8019 Karachkina, discovered by German astronomers Lutz D. Schmadel and Freimut Börngen at Tautenburg on 14 October 1990, was named in her honor (). On 23 November 1999, the minor planet 8089 Yukar was named after her husband, Yurij Vasil&#x27;evicht Karachkin (b. 1940), a physics teacher at CrAO&#x27;s school.().

<doc id="624432" wikidata="Q998240" url="?curid=624432" title="Black bulbul">
<text>The black bulbul (Hypsipetes leucocephalus), also known as the Himalayan black bulbul or Asian black bulbul, is a member of the bulbul family of passerine birds. It is found primarily in the Himalayas, its range stretching from Pakistan eastward to Southeast Asia. It is the type species of the genus &quot;Hypsipetes&quot;, established by Nicholas Aylward Vigors in the early 1830s. There are a number of subspecies, mostly varying in the shade of the body plumage which ranges from grey to black, and some also occur in white-headed morphs, as also suggested by its specific epithet &quot;leucocephalus&quot;, literally &quot;white head&quot;. The legs and bill are always rich orange-red.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The black bulbul was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the thrushes in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Turdus leucocephalus&quot;. Gmelin based his account on &quot;Le Merle Dominiquain de la Chine&quot;, a white-headed morph from China that had been described in 1782 by the French naturalist Pierre Sonnerat. The type locality was subsequently restricted to Guangzhou (formerly Canton) in China. The black bulbul is now one of 19 species placed in the genus &quot;Hypsipetes&quot; that was introduced in 1831 by the Irish zoologist Nicholas Vigors. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;hupsi&quot; meaning &quot;high&quot; with &quot;petēs&quot; meaning &quot;-flyer&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;leucocephalus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;leukokephalos&quot; meaning &quot;white-headed&quot; (from &quot;leukos&quot; &quot;white&quot; and &quot;-kephalos&quot; &quot;-headed&quot;). The black bulbul was formerly considered to be conspecific with the Malagasy bulbul. The common name &quot;black bulbul&quot; is also used as an alternate name for the Malagasy bulbul. Formerly, the square-tailed bulbul was also classified as two subspecies of the black bulbul.

=== Subspecies ===
Ten subspecies are currently recognized, although the reproductive isolation mechanisms such as vocalization and geographic distributions of these populations still remain to be studied:

* &quot;H. l. psaroides&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species. Found along the Himalayas from the Kunar Valley (north-eastern Afghanistan) and northern Pakistan through Arunachal Pradesh (northern India) and the central Himalayas to north-western Myanmar
* Assam black bulbul (&quot;H. l. nigrescens&quot;) - : Found in Assam and Manipur (north-eastern India), and the Chin Hills (western Myanmar)
* Burmese black bulbul (&quot;H. l. concolor&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species. Found from eastern Myanmar and southern Yunnan (southern China) through Indochina
* &quot;H. l. ambiens&quot; - : Found in north-eastern Myanmar and western Yunnan (southern China)
* &quot;H. l. sinensis&quot; - : Found in northern Yunnan (southern China)
* &quot;H. l. stresemanni&quot; - : Members of this race have white heads. Found in central Yunnan (southern China)
* &quot;H. l. leucothorax&quot; - : Members of this race have white heads. Found in central China
* &quot;H. l. leucocephalus&quot; - : Members of this race have white heads. Found in south-eastern China
* &quot;H. l. nigerrimus&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in Taiwan
* &quot;H. l. perniger&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species. Found on Hainan Island (off south-eastern China)

==Description==

The black bulbul is in length, with a long tail. The body plumage ranges from slate grey to shimmering black, depending on the race. The beak, legs, and feet are all orange and the head has a black fluffy crest. Sexes are similar in plumage, but young birds lack the crest, have whitish underparts with a grey breast band, and have a brown tint to the upperparts. They have a black streak behind the eye and on the ear coverts. Although males and females are indistinguishable to the human eye, there are significant differences in the ultraviolet reflectivity of the plumage making them readily distinguishable to the bulbuls themselves.

===Vocalisations===
They can be quite noisy, making various loud cheeping, mewing and grating calls. The Himalayan form has been reported to make a call resembling a goat kid, throwing back its neck when calling.

==Distribution and habitat==
This bulbul is found in broad-leaved forests, cultivation and gardens mainly in hilly areas, but Himalayan populations are known to sometimes descend into the adjoining plains in winter.

===Breeding===
It builds its nest in a tree or bush; the nest is a cup placed in a fork and made from grasses, dry leaves, mosses, lichens and cobwebs. The lining is made up of ferns, rootlets and other soft material. Both sexes participate in nest construction. Two or three eggs form the usual clutch.

===Food and feeding===
Black bulbuls feed mainly on seeds and insects, and they are often seen in small groups, either roosting or flying about in search of food. They are particularly fond of berries. They are known to feed on a wide range of berries including &quot;Celtis&quot;, &quot;Rosa&quot;, &quot;Melia&quot; and &quot;Ehretia&quot; in the Himalayas. They feed on the nectar of &quot;Salmalia&quot;, &quot;Erythrina&quot;, &quot;Rhododendron&quot; and other species. They make aerial sallies for insects.

<doc id="624433" wikidata="Q1353408" url="?curid=624433" title="Fallen Angels (1995 film)">
<text>Fallen Angels is a 1995 Hong Kong neo-noir crime comedy-drama film written and directed by Wong Kar-wai. It features two intertwined storylines—one tells the story of a hitman wishing to leave the criminal underworld (Leon Lai), the prostitute he starts a relationship with (Karen Mok), and his agent (Michelle Reis), who is infatuated with him. The other story is of a mute ex-convict on the run from the police (Takeshi Kaneshiro) and a mentally unstable woman dumped by her boyfriend (Charlie Yeung). Set in 1995 pre-Handover Hong Kong, &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; explores the characters&#x27; loneliness, their alienation from the situations around them, and yearning for connections in a hectic city.

Wong initially wrote &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; as the third story of his preceding film, &quot;Chungking Express&quot; (1994), but split them into two separate projects due to their cumulative length. Similar to &quot;Chungking Express&quot;, &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; features a fragmented narrative that emphasises mood and atmosphere over structure. Whereas its predecessor incorporates bright daytime colours, &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; consists of scenes exclusively shot at night and using darker colours alongside bright neons. Wong considered the two movies to be complementary counterparts exploring contemporary Hong Kong. Cinematographer Christopher Doyle extensively used wide-angle lens to distort the characters&#x27; faces on the screen, conveying their isolation from the surrounding world. Doyle also creates distorted tension in scenes of extreme violence with frantic, out-of-focus visuals. The soundtrack extensively uses trip hop and pop songs to convey mood and maintain an &quot;urban environment&quot; that plays with popular culture.

&quot;Fallen Angels&quot; was released in September 1995. Upon release, critics commented that its styles resembled those deployed in &quot;Chungking Express&quot;; many lamented that Wong had become self-indulgent, though as time went on critics began to be more appreciative of the film. At the 15th Hong Kong Film Awards in 1996, it won three awards: Best Supporting Actress for Mok, Best Cinematography for Doyle, and Best Original Score for Roel A. Garcia and Frankie Chan. Retrospectively, critics commented that though &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; was not as groundbreaking as its predecessor, it remained one of Wong&#x27;s most captivating films, cementing his trademark styles. The film&#x27;s abstract, unconventional style, the context in which it was made, and its use of pastiche and intertextuality with regards to both popular culture and its predecessor &quot;Chungking Express&quot; have led to the movie being described as a postmodern film and as suggesting a postmodern reading.

Since its release, &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; has encompassed a large cult following, and is notable for being the last film Wong fully shot in his native Hong Kong before embarking on more ambitious international productions.

==Plot==
Hitman Wong Chi-ming and a woman he calls his &quot;partner&quot; talk while smoking cigarettes. After Wong responds to the partner&#x27;s question of if they are still partners, the scene cuts into the story.

The pair, despite being business partners for nearly three years, rarely meet, exchanging their assassination plans via letters and faxes. The partner cleans the hitman&#x27;s cramped apartment, buys his groceries, and faxes blueprints of assassination locations. Obsessed with Wong and infatuated with his mysterious nature, she analyzes his trash. After a successful assassination, Wong runs into Ah-Hoi, an old classmate who recognises him. The old classmate tries to sell him an insurance policy, but remembering he does not have a beneficiary, Wong declines.

The partner goes to a bar Wong frequents and daydreams about him. After playing a piece of music on the bar jukebox, the partner returns to her apartment and masturbates to the thought of Wong. Afterwards, she encounters Ho Chi-mo, a mute ex-convict on the run from the police in her apartment building. During their second killing of the night, Wong and his partner look for each other in the area. The job is successful, but Wong is shot in the arm.

Increasingly frustrated by the monotone, futile life of contract killing and his lack of free will, Wong quits and sets up a meeting with his partner but no-shows. Certain that she will show up at the bar in a couple of days looking for him, he asks the bartender to suggest a piece of music on the jukebox called &quot;Forget Him&quot; () with the number &quot;1818&quot;. After listening, the partner cries alone at the bar. Meanwhile, Wong has a late night meal at McDonald&#x27;s, where he encounters an eccentric woman nicknamed &quot;Blondie&quot;, who sits next to him and invites him into her apartment. While they spend time together, the scene is juxtaposed against the hitman&#x27;s partner masturbating until she breaks down crying.

Blondie believes Wong is the ex-lover who left her for another woman (likely the hitman&#x27;s partner). Meanwhile, the hitman&#x27;s partner walks past Blondie in a subway station and the two turn back and look at each other. The partner detects Wong&#x27;s scent on Blondie, suggesting she knows about the relationship.

After Wong and his partner meet again, he tells her he wants to terminate their business relationship. She asks that he do one more job. Afterwards, Wong breaks off his relationship with Blondie, leaving her heartbroken before she bites him to leave her mark on him. The hitman sets out for his final killing job while the hitman&#x27;s partner makes a phone call that gives away Wong&#x27;s location to rivals – revealing the job to be a set-up. Wong drinks alcohol and braces himself in the bathroom for a tense showdown before being killed by his rivals. Wong however is pleased that he has finally been able to achieve free will—the free will to make his own decisions and die.

The chaotic Chungking Mansions, where the hitman&#x27;s partner lives, is also home to Ho Chi-mo, an ex-convict who has escaped prison and is on the run from the police. Recognising their shared backgrounds in criminality, she helps him elude the police when they search for him. Ho is mute and lives with his father. For work, he breaks into other people&#x27;s businesses at night and sells their goods and services, often forcibly to unwilling customers. He keeps running into the same girl at night, Charlie. Every time they meet, she cries on his shoulder and tells him the same sob story. Her ex-boyfriend, Johnny, left her for a girl named Blondie. She enlists his help in searching for Blondie and Ho Chi-mo falls in love with her. Later, she stands him up and he changes his ways, beginning a friendship and work relationship with a restaurant manager. He begins to film things around him with a video camera. His father passes away, and Ho watches the videos filmed to remember him. He falls back into abusive habits, going so far as to cut off the hair of a man whose family he in the past forced to eat an excessive amount of ice cream. He and Charlie do not come into contact for a few months, but they run into each other while he is masquerading as a business owner. She is in a stewardess uniform and in a new relationship. She does not acknowledge him.

Some time later, the partner narrates that she decided to never again be personally involved with her hitmen in the aftermath of Wong&#x27;s death. Nearby, Ho Chi-mo is also alone when he is beaten up by a local gang. Seeing this, the partner realises that Ho is feeling the same sense of loss as her. They go for a ride on Ho Chi-mo&#x27;s motorbike. He narrates that while there is no chemistry there is still some kind of connection. As they ride through early-hours Hong Kong they cross through the Cross-Harbour Tunnel in scenes evocative of those of Ho Chi-mo and Charlie earlier in the film, with the light of dawn being the only instance of daytime in the movie. The partner comments that even though it is just temporary and that she has not been close to a man in ages, she enjoys the warmth he brings in the moment.

==Cast==
* Leon Lai as Wong Chi-ming, the hitman
* Michelle Reis as the hitman&#x27;s &quot;partner&quot;
* Takeshi Kaneshiro as Ho Chi-mo, the mute ex-convict (He Zhiwu in Mandarin)

* Chan Man-lei as Ho Chi-mo&#x27;s father

* Benz Kong as Ah-Hoi, the hitman&#x27;s childhood classmate

==Development and production==
Originally conceived by Wong as the third story for 1994&#x27;s &quot;Chungking Express&quot; involving a lovesick hitman, it was cut after he decided that it was complete without it, and that the tone of the more demented content was not suited for the more light-hearted &quot;Chungking Express.&quot; Wong Kar-wai also explained that he had had so much pleasure in making the first story of &quot;Chungking Express&quot; that he felt he had made the film too long, and so he decided to skip the third story in releasing &quot;Chungking Express&quot;. After the release of &quot;Chungking Express&quot;, Wong noted that the story of a lovesick hitman still interested him, and so he decided to develop it into &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;. Wong also decided to &quot;gender-reverse&quot; the attributes of the roles in his new film, with the gun-wielding attributes of Brigitte Lin in &quot;Chungking Express&quot; being manifested in the hitman Leon Lai would play, while the sneaking-in of Faye Wong in &quot;Chungking Express&quot; to other apartments was reversed by Takeshi Kaneshiro&#x27;s character sneaking into shops and businesses in &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;.

He instead decided to develop the story further into its own feature film and borrowed elements of &quot;Chungking Express&quot;, such as themes, locations and methods of filming. Wanting to also try to differentiate it from &quot;Chungking&quot; and to try something new, Wong decided along with cinematographer Christopher Doyle to shoot mainly at night and using extreme wide-angle lenses, keeping the camera as close to the talents as possible to give a detached effect from the world around them.

Many of the plot devices are related to those deployed in its predecessor &quot;Chungking Express&quot;. The wide-angle distortion of images creates an effect of distance-in-proximity, conveying the characters&#x27; solitude. The visuals are frantic, out-of-focus, and neon-lit. Rather than relying on dialogues, the story is narrated through characters&#x27; voiceovers. The film&#x27;s use of pop songs has also received extensive commentary.

There is also the use of different film stocks throughout the film and also a number of scenes where the film switches to black and white inserts covered in a grainy &#x27;noise&#x27; effect. There is also a constant sense of Doyle&#x27;s camera being present that is never disguised, with meticulous use of hand-held camera movement in the film. This &#x27;follows&#x27; the characters as they move through a scene. The film also makes use of &quot;claustrophobic&quot; shots involving fast and slow camera movements in a frenetic pace interpolated within crowded, chaotic locations in Hong Kong. The film&#x27;s colours are also distorted, with a distinctive green filter reminiscent of 1990s grunge aesthetics.

A particularly heavy theme of &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; is the city itself, with &quot;bedazzling shots&quot; of sites associated with 1990s Hong Kong such as neon-lit billboards and now-closed Kai Tak Airport, as well as the city&#x27;s visual landscape and 1990s uncertainty and anxieties present in its population at the time because of the looming handover of Hong Kong to China overwhelming the mood and feel of the film. Fallen Angels as such has been described as a &quot;time capsule&quot; of Hong Kong&#x27;s mid-to-late-20th-century cultural golden age before its handover to China in 1997. Wong himself stated that the movie&#x27;s main character is the &quot;city itself&quot;.

In an interview, Wong had this to say:

==Soundtrack==
Typical for a Wong Kar-wai film, &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; extensively uses pop songs, featuring a largely trip hop soundtrack that appealed to the widespread popularity of trip hop in 1994–1995. Wong Kar-wai initially wished to use the music of English trip hop band Massive Attack but discovered it was too expensive, and so asked his composer in Hong Kong (Frankie Chan) to compose something similar in style. As such, one track that is played prominently throughout the film is &quot;Because I&#x27;m Cool&quot; by Nogabe &quot;Robinson&quot; Randriaharimalala. It is a re-orchestration of Karmacoma by Massive Attack, and samples the song. Also featured in the &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; soundtrack is a dream pop version of &quot;Forget Him&quot; sung by Shirley Kwan, a reworking of the classic by Teresa Teng, and one of the very few &quot;contemporary&quot; Cantopop songs ever used by Wong Kar-wai in his films. In the film, the song is used by the hitman to indirectly communicate the message to his assistant that he wants her to &quot;forget him&quot;, and is also used in the scenes afterwards in the McDonald&#x27;s restaurant, where it plays over the restaurant&#x27;s speakers as the hitman and Blondie encounter each other, a scene juxtaposed by the misery and sadness of the assistant crying. In contrast to Wong&#x27;s other films such as &quot;Chungking Express&quot;, &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;&#x27; soundtrack displays more &#x27;ethereal pieces&#x27;, featuring the 1994 avant-garde/experimental ambient piece &quot;Speak My Language&quot; by American avant-garde artist Laurie Anderson. The song is used in scenes where the hitman&#x27;s assistant visits the bar that the hitman frequents and masturbates in his room out of sexual frustration. The song, a moody track speaking of the living and the dead, is emblematic of the film&#x27;s highly bleak outlook. In the ending scene, the Flying Pickets version of &quot;Only You&quot; is used, described as the only track in the film to express hopefulness, as the hitman&#x27;s assistant and the ex-convict find a chance to escape from the film&#x27;s seemingly perpetual night, and as they end the film seeking emotional redemption in their shared loss and the sunrise that emerges over the Hong Kong skyline. The film&#x27;s official soundtrack was originally released on CD in 1995 but has since been occasionally re-released.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Fallen Angels&quot; was released in September 1995, premiering at the 1995 Toronto International Film Festival, where it received considerable critical success and became the focus of the festival for its notable visual style.

In the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; three stars out of a possible four. Ebert stated the film appealed to a niche audience including art students, &quot;the kinds of people you see in the Japanese animation section of the video store, with their sleeves cut off so you can see their tattoos&quot;, and &quot;those who subscribe to more than three film magazines&quot;, but would prove unsuitable for an average moviegoer. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the film relied more on style than substance and wrote: &quot;Although the story takes a tragic turn, the movie feels as weightless as the tinny pop music that keeps its restless midnight ramblers darting around the city like electronic toy figures in a gaming arcade.&quot;

In the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, J. Hoberman wrote:The acme of neo-new-wavism, the ultimate in MTV alienation, the most visually voluptuous flick of the &quot;fin de siècle&quot;, a pyrotechnical wonder about mystery, solitude, and the irrational love of movies that pushes Wong&#x27;s style to the brink of self-parody.

Hoberman and Amy Taubin both placed &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; on their lists for the top 10 films of the decade, and the &quot;Village Voice&quot;″s decade-end critics poll placed &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; at No. 10, the highest-ranking of any Wong Kar-wai film.

Rotten Tomatoes reported that 95% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 7.90/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100 based on 13 critic reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Author Stephen Teo, in the book &quot;Wong Kar-wai: Auteur of Time&quot;, considered &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; Wong&#x27;s most social and political film. Meanwhile, Peter Brunette stated the nonlinear structure and &quot;anti-realist, hyperstylized&quot; cinematography of &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; and its predecessor &quot;Chungking Express&quot; pointed towards the future of cinema. Scholars Justin Clemens and Dominic Pettman commented on the social and political undertones of &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;: by portraying the characters&#x27; loneliness, alienation and indecisiveness, the film represents a metaphor for the political climate of contemporary Hong Kong, the impending end of British rule and transition to Chinese rule in 1997. Film critic Thorsten Botz-Bornstein highlighted &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; as a film that represented Wong&#x27;s peculiar appeal to both traditional &quot;Eastern&quot; and &quot;Western&quot; audiences—it portrays Hong Kong with &quot;post-colonial modernity&quot; showcased through crammed apartments, public transportation, noodle parlors that were emblematic of modern Asia&#x27;s consumerism. On the one hand, those elements could not be rightfully called &quot;traditionally Asian&quot;; on the other, Western audience viewed such elements with astounding curiosity.

==Box office==
The film made HK$7,476,025 during its Hong Kong run.

On 21 January 1998, the film began a limited North American theatrical run through Kino International. Playing solely at Film Forum in New York City, the film grossed US$13,804 in its opening weekend. The final North American theatrical gross was US$163,145.

In 2004, Australian distribution company Accent Film Entertainment released a remastered widescreen version of the film enhanced for 16x9 screens.

==Home media and streaming==
Kino International, who initially distributed the film on DVD, prepared a re-release of the film from a new high-definition transfer on 11 November 2008. Kino released the film on Blu-ray in America in 26 March 2010. It has since gone out of print.

The film was picked up by the Criterion Collection and given a new Blu-ray release on 23 March 2021 in a collection of 7 Wong Kar-wai films.

Also, &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; could previously be streamed on FilmStruck (shut down in 2018) and is currently available on The Criterion Collection subscription service channel. In May 2019, Wong Kar Wai announced that all of his films would be remastered by his production studio, Jet Tone Productions, and be distributed in the United States through Janus Films and the Criterion Collection. It was released in the UK on DVD and Blu-ray by Artificial Eye.

<doc id="624435" wikidata="Q5432235" url="?curid=624435" title="Fallen Angels (Niven, Pournelle, and Flynn novel)">
<text>Fallen Angels (1991) is a science fiction novel by three American science fiction authors, Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, and Michael Flynn, and published by Jim Baen. Winner of 1992 Prometheus Award, the novel was written as a tribute to the science fiction fandom and includes many of its well-known figures, legends, and practices. It champions modern technology and ridicules its critics, including, budget cutting politicians, fringe environmentalists, and the forces of ignorance.

The novel takes aim at several targets of ridicule: Senator William Proxmire, radical environmentalists and mystics, such as a character who believes that one cannot freeze to death in the snow because ice is a crystal and &quot;crystals are healing.&quot; It also mocks ignorance in journalism (for example, one &quot;expert&quot; cited in a news article believes that the astronauts must have superhuman strength, based on a photograph of a &quot;weightless&quot; astronaut easily handling heavy construction equipment) and the non-scientific world in general. Several real people are tuckerized into the book in a more positive light, including many fans who made donations to charity for that express purpose and a character called &quot;RMS&quot; (presumably Richard M. Stallman) who leads a network of hackers called the Legion of Doom, connected by a series of BBS systems.

==Setting==
The novel is set in an unspecified &quot;near-future&quot; (one of the main characters has childhood memories of the Exxon Valdez disaster) in which a radical left-wing environmentalist movement has joined forces with the religious right through a shared distaste for modern technology. The resulting bipartisan conspiracy has gained control of the US government and imposed draconian luddite laws which, in attempts to curb global warming, have ironically brought about the greatest environmental catastrophe in recorded history: an ice age which may eventually escalate into a Snowball Earth.

The exact process is described: clouds are water condensation, and so cannot form without cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere. The emission laws have removed most of this, reducing cloud cover, meaning the ground loses heat faster. This in combination with the drop in greenhouse gases has resulted in the return and exacerbation of the Little Ice Age, which has become self-perpetuating as glaciers have a much higher albedo than other surfaces.

As a radical totalitarian environmentalist party now controls the US government, the scientific explanation is denounced as &quot;propaganda from life-hating technophiles&quot;, and blame for the ice age is instead solely placed on the society surviving in orbit. Science fiction fandom forms the core of a pro-technology underground in the United States, working in tandem with hacker movements. Other technologists – accused by the government of pursuing &quot;materialist science&quot; – were removed from their jobs and forced underground, where they were generally unable to continue their work. This rabid distaste for technology has resulted in the collapse of the economy, and lack of education and a complicit media has left the majority of the population credulous and easily manipulated. The Greens have been in power for most of the lives of the characters.

As glaciers rapidly advance south, Canada and the northern United States are all but destroyed. Near the edge of the glaciers, in Milwaukee, barbaric feudal systems arise as the federal government and markets collapse, leaving violence and disease in their wake. In orbit, Mir and Space Station Freedom survive in tandem with a Lunar colony, but with no support from Earth. The city of Winnipeg is the last major outpost of Canadian civilization, warmed and inhabitable due to immense amounts of solar power beamed from the space stations.

==Plot summary==

Astronauts from the orbital society fly a modified scramjet, redesigned to harvest nitrogen from the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Government policy declares that these ships are responsible for the ice age, so the scramjet is shot down with a surface-to-air missile. The pilot and copilot, an Earth-born American named Alex MacLeod and a space-born Russo-American named Gordon Tanner, are forced to crash land in Canada atop the glaciers.

Upon hearing of this, the fan underground embarks on a rescue mission – a group of fans rides north through the Dakotas to rescue the astronauts before they can be apprehended by the Government. Upon reaching the Dakotas, the fans must travel largely on foot, as their van is unable to traverse the glaciers. However, they have a major advantage over their foes in the government – their relationship with the space station provides them with superior navigational abilities; following the fall of scientific society, the United States Air Force (USAF) no longer enjoys access to satellite reconnaissance. The fans are able to reach the downed spacecraft well in advance of the USAF.

Their escape is aided in a similar manner. Though the Angels are unable to walk due to their overexposure to weightlessness and must be dragged along on sleds, the microwave power transmission beam reserved for Winnipeg is diverted to warm the travellers as they return south to their van. In addition, a tribe of nomadic Inuit peoples shares supplies with them in thanks for the warmth provided by the microwave beam.

Upon finally reaching their van, the rescuers flee to a small science fiction convention of some 50 fans at a mansion owned by one of their own. Once there, one of the fans takes on the role of personal trainer to help the Angels adjust to Earth&#x27;s gravity including various asanas from yoga. At the con, the fans brainstorm a daring plan - before the Greens had come to power, one of the Board of Trustees for the Metropolitan Museum of Boston by the name of Ron Cole supposedly refurbished a Titan II rocket. This rocket still exists at the Museum of Science and Industry at Chicago. The fans and the Angels leave for Chicago just moments before the mansion is raided by the Green police.

The trip to Chicago gives the reader a brutal depiction of American life without basic technology. A blizzard forces the fans to take shelter in a farm town - where at least one towns-person dies in each blizzard for lack of heating oil. After hitching a ride in a consignment of cheese, the fans are captured by the feudal inhabitants of Milwaukee who are burning the excess houses in the city for heat. One of their captors has the food swapped with moonshine liquor and forces the group into slavery to pay off a series of trumped-up &quot;fines&quot;. They are assisted by a fellow fan amongst their captors, and are able to continue on to Chicago.

When the fans finally meet Ron Cole, their hopes are crushed. The rocket is a decaying wreck, and Cole is a shadow of his former self due to invasive &quot;reeducation&quot; treatments. However, Cole is able to put them on another path – a privately constructed single-stage-to-orbit spacecraft at Edwards Air Force Base, disguised by the simple and effective method of its designer, Gary Hudson, declaring it non-functional.

<doc id="624436" wikidata="Q884672" url="?curid=624436" title="Block party">
<text>A block party or street party is a party in which many members of a single community congregate, either to observe an event of some importance or simply for mutual solidarity and enjoyment. The name comes from the form of the party, which often involves closing an entire city block to vehicle traffic or just a single street. Many times, there will be a celebration in the form of playing music, games, dance and activities with food such as popcorn machines and barbecues. When multiple streets become cordoned off, those are referred to as street fairs.

As a form of activism street parties are festive and/or artistic efforts to reclaim roadways as public space by large groups of people. They were made known in Western Europe and North America by the actions of Reclaim the Streets, a widespread &quot;dis-organization&quot; dedicated to reclaiming public space from automobiles and consumerism.

==Countries==

===Poland===
Poland Orange Alternative staged festive protests to break the Communist government&#x27;s monopoly on public life.

===United Kingdom===

In the UK, street parties are mainly known as private residents&#x27; events without wider neighbourhood publicity and have a festive cultural meaning, especially in England and southern Wales. They have historically been held in the summer to commemorate major national events, such as VE Day or for royal events such as jubilees, with bunting dressing the street, and children having fun in the street. An estimated 10 million people took part in street parties in 1977 for the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee.

The tradition seems to have begun in the United Kingdom after World War I as residents&#x27; organised &quot;peace teas&quot; to celebrate the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.

The tradition was boosted for the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in April 2011 with about 1 million people joining in street parties. For the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in June 2012 about 2 million took part.

Some street parties are held annually or at any time for residents to meet their neighbours in a traffic-free street in a private street party. Some &quot;street parties&quot; are wider public events taking many forms with any social or cultural activity.

===United States===
Block parties are reported as a World War I innovation originating from the East Side of New York City, where an entire block was insulated and patriotic songs sung, and a parade held to honor the members of that block who had gone off to war. Traditionally, many inner city block parties were actually held illegally, because they did not file for an event permit from the local authorities. However, police turned a blind eye to them.

In the United States, block parties usually occur on holidays such as Independence Day and Memorial Day. Some towns may also have an annual block party.

Block parties gained popularity in the United States during the 1970s, particularly within the hip hop community. Block parties were usually outside on the street, and the DJs powered their sound systems using streetlights, as referenced in the song &quot;South Bronx&quot; by KRS-One.

Sometimes, the occasion may be a theme, such as a recent popular film or &quot;welcome to our town&quot; for a new family. Often block parties involve barbecues and lawn games such as Simon says, karaoke, and group dancing such as the electric slide, the Macarena, or line dancing. In many small towns, local firefighters may also participate in the party, bringing out trucks that are displayed for show.

<doc id="624443" wikidata="Q938581" url="?curid=624443" title="Flinders Island">
<text>Flinders Island, the largest island in the Furneaux Group, is a island in the Bass Strait, northeast of the island of Tasmania. Today Flinders Island is part of the state of Tasmania, Australia. It is from Cape Portland and is located on 40° south, a zone known as the Roaring Forties.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Flinders Island was first inhabited at least 35,000 years ago, when people made their way from Australia across the then land-bridge which is now Bass Strait. A population remained until about 4,500 years ago, succumbing to thirst and hunger following an acute El Niño climate shift.

===European Arrival===
Some of the south-eastern islands of the Furneaux Group were first recorded in 1773 by British navigator Tobias Furneaux, commander of , the support vessel with James Cook on Cook&#x27;s second voyage. In February 1798, British navigator Matthew Flinders charted some of the southern islands, using one of the schooner &quot;Francis&quot;&#x27; open boats. Later that year, Flinders returned and finished charting the islands in the &quot;Norfolk&quot;; he then went on to complete the first circumnavigation of Tasmania (1798–99), accompanied by George Bass, proving Tasmania to be an island separated from the Australian mainland by Bass Strait, later named in honour of George Bass.

===Etymology===
James Cook named the islands Furneaux&#x27;s Islands, after Tobias Furneaux. Flinders named the largest island in the group &quot;Great Island&quot;. He also named a group of mountains on Flinders Island, the &quot;Three Patriarchs&quot;. The small island just to the east, Flinders named &quot;Babel Island&quot; from the noises made by the seabirds there. Phillip Parker King later named the largest island Flinders Island, after Matthew Flinders.
Flinders named Mount Chappell Island after his wife Ann née Ann Chappelle.
There are three islands named &quot;Flinders&#x27; Island&quot;—the large island on the east side of Bass Strait, named by Phillip Parker King; an island in the Investigator Group of South Australia, named by Matthew Flinders after his young brother Samuel Flinders (midshipman on the ); and an island in the Flinders Group north of Cooktown, Queensland was named after Matthew Flinders.

===Settlement===

In the late 18th century, the island was often frequented by sealers and Aboriginal women, the majority of whom had been kidnapped from their mainland tribes. Seal stocks soon collapsed, causing the last sealing permit to be issued in 1828. Many sealers&#x27; families chose to stay in the Furneaux Group, subsisting on cattle grazing and muttonbirding.

====Wybalenna Aboriginal Establishment====
From 1831, the remnants of the Tasmanian Aboriginal population were exiled firstly to &quot;The Lagoons&quot; just south of what is now the town of Whitemark, and then in 1833 to the Wybalenna Aboriginal Establishment at Settlement Point. Wybalenna is translated as &quot;dwellings&quot; or more colloquially &quot;Black Man&#x27;s Houses&quot; from the language of the Ben Lomond people. These ~180 survivors were deemed to be safe from white settlers here, but conditions were poor with around 130 Aboriginal people dying at Wybalenna alone. This forced relocation scheme was therefore short-lived. 

In 1847, after a campaign by the Aboriginal population against their Commandant, Henry Jeanneret, which involved a petition to Queen Victoria, the remaining 47 Aboriginal people were again relocated, this time to Oyster Cove Station, an ex-convict settlement 56 kilometres south of Tasmania&#x27;s capital, Hobart. Land on the neighbouring Cape Barren Island was formally reserved for the Aboriginal community in 1881.

====Soldier settlement schemes====
From the late 19th century freehold land was given out, but it was not until the 1950s that a proper settlement scheme was initiated, mainly drawing settlers from mainland Tasmania and central New South Wales to Flinders Island&#x27;s eastern shore. The Municipality of Flinders Island was instituted in 1903.

==Geography and nature==
The island forms part of the state of Tasmania, and part of the Municipality of Flinders Island local government area. Flinders Island is only one of the many islands included in the Municipal area. Of these islands Flinders Island is the only island with more than one permanent settlement, and is by far the largest in the Furneaux Group.

The island is about from north to south, and from east to west. with a total land area of . Mount Strzelecki in the south west is the island&#x27;s highest peak at . About a third of the island is mountainous and rugged with ridges of granite running the length of the island. The coastal areas are dominated by sandy deposits often taking the shape of dunes. Many coastal lagoons punctuate the eastern shore, formed by dunes blocking further drainage. This drainage is mainly provided by many small streams, few of them permanently flowing directly leading to the waters of Bass Strait or such a lagoon.
The coastal areas are mainly covered in scrub or shrubs, whereas the vegetation at a higher elevation consists of woodland, mainly eucalyptus species. The total number of plant species in the Furneaux Group well exceeds 800, showing the great biodiversity of its ecosystem. Native bird species include the Cape Barren goose (&quot;Cereopsis novaehollandiae&quot;) and the short-tailed shearwater (&quot;Puffinus tenuirostris&quot;). Marsupial mammals are represented by Bennett&#x27;s wallaby (&quot;Macropus rufogriseus&quot;), brushtail possum (&quot;Trichosurus vulpecula&quot;), eastern pygmy possum (&quot;Cercartetus nanus&quot;), potoroo (&quot;Potorous apicalis&quot;), common ringtail possum (&quot;Pseudocheirus peregrinus&quot;) and Tasmanian pademelon (&quot;Thylogale billardierii&quot;). The cape fur seal (&quot;Arctocephalus pusillus&quot;) is the sole placental mammal commonly found on Flinders. It is the only remaining habitat of a subspecies of common wombat, V. u. ursinus, which is listed as vulnerable by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and IUCN Red List. The area surrounding Mount Strzelecki in the south west of the island constitutes Strzelecki National Park. The island also supports a population of feral turkeys (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;).

===Climate===
Flinders Island has a mild oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) that is strongly moderated by the Bass Strait. The summers are drier and less cloudy than the winters, and annual average rainfall totals less than .

===Central Flinders Island Important Bird Area===

A 30 km2 tract of land on the island, lying mainly to the north and east of Whitemark, has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it contains three breeding colonies of the endangered forty-spotted pardalote and habitat used by flame robins. It also supports populations of several of Tasmania&#x27;s restricted-range endemic bird species, including the green rosella, yellow-throated honeyeater, black-headed honeyeater, strong-billed honeyeater, Tasmanian thornbill, black currawong and dusky robin.

===Eastern Flinders Island Important Bird Area===
A 187 km2 strip of land extending the full 70 km length of Flinders Island&#x27;s eastern coastline has also been identified as an IBA. it supports small numbers of fairy terns, large numbers of hooded plovers and over 1% of the world populations of chestnut teal, pied oystercatchers and sooty oystercatchers.

==Demographics==
The population in 2011 was 700 people; the median age being 45.

Settlements include Whitemark (which has the island&#x27;s main airstrip and about 155 inhabitants (2011) and Lady Barron (approx. 110 inhabitants), Blue Rocks, Killiecrankie, Wingaroo and Wybalenna (all below Lady Barron&#x27;s population figure).

The 2016 census shows that the population is rising. The population of the Local Government Area, i.e. Flinders and Cape Barren Islands is 906; up from 776 in the 2011 Census and to 1010 in 2019.

The population of the 7255 postal code area, i.e. Flinders, is 833 up from 702 in 2011, a rise of over 16% for the Municipality and over 18% for Flinders over the 5-year period.

The median age of people in the Municipality has risen from 52 to 53, and the number of families has increased from 218 to 243.

==Communications==
As of 4 October 2010, Sharp Airlines has been operating services between Essendon, Flinders Island and Launceston. Using 19-seat Metroliners, they fly between Essendon Airport and Flinders Island Airport three return flights a week (65 minutes) and Launceston Airport and Flinders Island Airport at least daily (25 minutes). The Tasmanian Aeroclub, Kirkhope Aviation and Vortex Air also offer charter services between Launceston, Flinders Island and Victoria (as well as surrounding Islands).

A ferry service delivering food and perishable goods is operated to the island weekly by Furneaux Freight between Bridport, Tasmania and Lady Barron, Tasmania and also monthly from Port Welshpool, Victoria.

Australian telecom provider Telstra offers the only mobile phone service on the island, providing 3G and 4G coverage across both Flinders and Cape Barren Island.

Internet access is limited to either a satellite dish connection or to use the 3G/4G network.

<text>Russell Wendell Simmons (born October 4, 1957) is an American entrepreneur, writer and record executive. He co-founded the hip-hop label Def Jam Recordings, and created the clothing fashion lines Phat Farm, Argyleculture, and Tantris. He has promoted veganism and a yoga lifestyle, and published books on lifestyle, health, and entrepreneurship. Simmons&#x27; net worth was estimated at $340 million in 2011.

After producing or managing artists such as Kurtis Blow, Run DMC, Whodini, and Jimmy Spicer, Simmons joined forces with producer Rick Rubin to found Def Jam Recordings. Under Simmons&#x27; leadership as chairman, Def Jam signed acts including the Beastie Boys, Public Enemy, LL Cool J, Jay-Z, DMX, and Kanye West. From 1992 to 1997, he also produced the Def Comedy Jam television program.

In 2017, Simmons was publicly accused of sexual assault by multiple women; he denied the allegations. Following these allegations, Simmons stepped down from his various business roles and charities, including his position at Def Jam.
==Early life==
Russell Wendell Simmons was born in the Hollis neighborhood of New York City&#x27;s Queens borough on October 4, 1957. His father was a public school administrator and his mother was a park administrator for the New York City Parks and Recreation Department. His brothers are painter Daniel Simmons Jr. and Joseph Simmons (better known as Rev Run of Run-DMC fame). In 1975, after graduating from August Martin High School, Simmons briefly attended the City College of New York in Harlem where he met a young DJ/Bboy, Kurt Walker, who influenced him to participate in the hip hop phenomenon. Upon hearing Eddie Cheeba perform in Harlem in 1977, Simmons knew that hip hop would be his career. Simmons stated, &quot;Hearing Cheeba in &#x27;77 made me feel like I had just witnessed the invention of the wheel.&quot; In 1979, Simmons met Robert Ford Jr., who began taking him to industry events and teaching him about the music business. Simmons would later credit Ford as his &quot;guru&quot;.

==Career==

Simmons co-founded Def Jam in 1984 with Rick Rubin, after many mergers, Simmons sold his share of the company for $120 million to Universal Music Group in 1998. Simmons co-produced and appeared in the 1985 film &quot;Krush Groove&quot;. Simmons&#x27; company, Rush Communications Inc., includes over ten businesses and three non-profits. Simmons, with his partner Stan Lathan, has also produced television hits HBO&#x27;s &quot;Def Comedy Jam&quot; and &quot;Def Poetry Jam&quot;, and currently has a development deal with HBO. In 1996, Simmons co-produced the hit film &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;, starring Eddie Murphy. In 1997, Simmons co-produced the film &quot;Def Jam&#x27;s How to Be a Player&quot;, starring Bill Bellamy. In 2003, Simmons co-founded RushCard, a prepaid debit card provider.

In 1992, Simmons launched the clothing line Phat Fashions LLC using the Phat Farm and Baby Phat labels. When Simmons first created Phat Fashions LLC, the clothing line was sold in a shop in the SoHo district of Manhattan. Simmons&#x27;s connections with well-known rap artists helped to promote the clothing line to a wide audience. The influence of designers such as Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger gave the clothing line a classic look and feel. Phat Fashions encompassed hip hop clothing for women and children, as well as men, and grew into a lifestyle brand with the addition of jewelry, perfume, and other merchandise. Phat Fashions LLC sold merchandise in two stores in New York and Montreal, as well as online at www.phatfarm.com. In addition, the clothing line was carried by some 3,000 retailers in the United States.

In 2001, &quot;Hip-Hop Minister&quot; and former Nation of Islam minister Conrad Tillard feuded with Simmons, accusing him of stoking violence by allowing the frequent use of words such as &quot;nigga&quot; and &quot;bitch&quot; in rap lyrics. Tillard then organized a summit in Harlem over what he viewed as negative imagery in hip hop. Simmons organized a counter-summit, urging the public not to &quot;support open and aggressive critics of the hip-hop community&quot;.

In 2004, Simmons sold Phat Farm and Baby Phat to the Kellwood Company for $140 million.

In the same year, Simmons formed Russell Simmons Music Group, or RSMG, a record label founded as a joint venture with Universal Music&#x27;s Island Def Jam Music Group. Tony Austin was the label&#x27;s president.

Simmons and his brothers founded the Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation in 1995. The foundation provides art education and support to under-serviced youth by helping people of color access the arts and by providing exhibition opportunities. The Foundation serves about 3,000 students annually and maintains two galleries. The Rush Arts Gallery in Chelsea, Manhattan and the Corridor Gallery in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn exhibit the work of more than 100 community and emerging artists.

In 2014, Claremont Lincoln University awarded Simmons an honorary doctorate degree in humane letters for his work as chairman of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding and for promoting mindfulness, compassion and inter-religious collaboration in the public sphere.

In October 2021, Simmons released a NFT collection, Masterminds of Hip Hop. It centered on driving forces in the hip hop music industry and was curated by Snoop Dogg.

==Personal life==
Simmons and model Kimora Lee met in November 1991, when she was 16 years old and still in high school. On December 20, 1998, they married on the island of Saint Barthélemy. They have two daughters. In March 2006, Simmons announced that he and Lee had ended their relationship; they divorced two years later.

Simmons has been a vegan since 1999. Stating love and respect for all religions, he describes himself as a Christian yogi who practices Jivamukti Yoga, which encourages vegetarianism and social and environmental activism. He is also a practitioner of Transcendental Meditation (TM) and a supporter of the David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and World Peace, which was established to ensure that any child in America who wants to learn and practice TM can do so.

==Social activism==
Simmons is an advocate of Ahimsa and veganism, citing animal rights along with the environmental and health benefits. He said he went vegan after watching the film Diet for a New America in the 1990s. He is a supporter of Farm Sanctuary, an organization working to end cruelty to farm animals. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals awarded him the 2001 PETA Humanitarian Award and the 2011 Person of the Year Award.

In 2009, Simmons organized thousands of protestors and hip-hop celebrities in front of City Hall demanding change of the sentencing rules of the Rockefeller Drug Laws.

In 2002, Simmons became chairman of the board of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding. In May 2009, he was appointed Goodwill Ambassador for the UN Slavery Memorial at the United Nations to honor the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. In a similar vein, Simmons is a supporter of the Somaly Mam Foundation, and was honored at their 2011 gala dinner. In 2011, Simmons officially endorsed the second Muslim Jewish Conference. Together with Rabbi Marc Schneier he served as the official patron of the conference held July 2011 in Kyiv, Ukraine. In 2011, he took part in the Occupy Wall Street protests, visiting the protesters at Zuccotti Park often and for many consecutive days.

Simmons is a longtime supporter of gay rights, and he encourages marriage equality. In 2011, when the retail corporation Lowe&#x27;s withdrew funding from the show &quot;All-American Muslim&quot;, Simmons promised to pay the Learning Channel for any revenue lost.

In 2012, Simmons supported Ohio congressman Dennis Kucinich&#x27;s re-election campaign, appearing with the politician at various speaking events. In November 2013, he pledged support for New York&#x27;s mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio in recognition of his support for animal rights.

In 2017, Simmons was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 23 in the list of 200 Most Influential Social-Entrepreneurs and Philanthropists Worldwide.

== Vegan burgers ==
Simmons is a senior advisor of the vegan burger brand Everything Legendary. In 2022, the company closed a $6 million series A round.

==Harriet Tubman sex tape controversy==
In August 2013, Simmons launched the controversial &quot;Harriet Tubman Sex Tape&quot; parody video on his YouTube channel, &quot;All Def Digital&quot;, which led to public outrage and many critics demanding an apology. The video featured an actress portraying the abolitionist Harriet Tubman (1822–1913) having sex with her slave owner with the intent of filming the act and blackmailing him to convince him to work on the Underground Railroad. People from his own community, such as filmmaker Spike Lee, were offended by the controversial comedy sketch.

On his website, Simmons posted an apology for the parody, writing:

Despite its removal from the All Def Digital channel, the video continues to be available via reuploaded versions.

==Sexual misconduct, assault and rape allegations==
===Background===
In November 2017, model Keri Claussen Khalighi accused Simmons of raping her in 1991, when she was 17. Simmons and Brett Ratner, whom Khalighi accused of watching them without intervening when she asked for his help, both deny that the encounter was non-consensual.

As the allegation was covered in the press, Terry Crews accused Simmons of attempting to influence him to take back sexual assault allegations that Crews had recently brought up against film executive Adam Venit, asking that Crews &quot;give him a pass ... ask that he be reinstated.&quot; Crews posted on his Twitter account a screenshot of the alleged e-mail he had received from Simmons.

On November 30, 2017, writer Jenny Lumet claimed that Simmons had raped her in 1991. In response, Simmons said he would step down from his positions with his businesses. On the same day, HBO announced that they would be removing Simmons&#x27; name and likeness from his stand-up comedy specials starting with the December 1 episode.

On December 13, 2017, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published an investigative report in which five women accused Simmons of sexual misconduct, including another alleged rape. On the same day, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published the accounts of four other women who accused Simmons of inappropriate conduct, including three more alleged rapes. In response to the allegations, Simmons stated he &quot;never had a sexual encounter that was not consensual or lawful. Ever.&quot;

On February 9, 2018, Simmons denied the allegations to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, saying (in part), &quot;I vehemently deny all the allegations made against me. They have shocked me to my core as I have never been abusive or violent in any way in my relations with women. I am blessed to have shared extraordinary relationships, whether through work or love, with many great women and I have enormous respect for the women&#x27;s movement worldwide and their struggle for respect, dignity, equality and power. I am devastated by any reason I may have given to anyone to say or think of me in the ways that are currently being described. I have separated myself from my businesses and charities to not become a distraction.&quot;

On April 25, 2018, Jennifer Jarosik, a filmmaker who also alleged Simmons raped her, dropped her lawsuit. The suit was dismissed with prejudice, meaning Jarosik cannot refile allegations in court.

On February 13, 2024, a lawsuit filed by Jane Doe in New York Federal Court obtained by &quot;People&quot;, alleged that she was sexually assaulted and harassed by her boss, Russell Simmons, in the 1990s. This was while pursuing her professional ambitions as an executive at Def Jam. On February 15, 2024, another lawsuit, this time alleging defamation, was filed against Simmons by former Def Jam executive Drew Dixon. Dixon was previously one of the three women to accuse him of rape in the December 2017 &quot;New York Times&quot; article.

===Accusers===
A number of women, some of whom were aged 17 at the time of the alleged incidents, have accused Simmons of sexual harassment, assault or rape:

====Sexual harassment or assault====
Women who said they had been sexually harassed or assaulted (including attempted rape) by Simmons include:

#Keri Claussen Khalighi, model
#Kelly Cutrone, publicist and author
#Luann de Lesseps, reality television personality
#Lisa Kirk, an acquaintance of Simmons&#x27;
#Toni Sallie, music journalist
#Amanda Seales, actor and comedian (verbal harassment)
#Natashia Williams-Blach, actress

====Rape====
Women who said they had been raped by Simmons include:

#Tina Baker, singer-turned-lawyer
#Drew Dixon, former music recording executive
#Sherri Hines, musician
#Jennifer Jarosik, filmmaker
#Jenny Lumet, screenwriter
#Sil Lai Abrams, writer and activist

===Resignation===
After the third assault allegation was published in a guest column by Jenny Lumet in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; in November 2017, Simmons stepped down from his roles in the label Def Jam Records, his yoga lifestyle brand, CNNMoney, and other media properties. Lumet, who is the daughter of filmmaker Sidney Lumet and the granddaughter of singer and civil rights activist Lena Horne, wrote: &quot;As a woman of color, I cannot express how wrenching it is to write this about a successful man of color. ... I feel a pang to protect your daughters. I don&#x27;t think you are inclined to protect mine.&quot;

HBO decided to remove Russell Simmons&#x27; name from &quot;All Def Comedy&quot;, a series he created to launch and showcase emerging comedians. HBO has not removed his name from Def Comedy Jams.

=== Documentary ===
A documentary film about the sexual assault allegations against Simmons, &quot;On the Record&quot;, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2020, and was released on HBO Max on May 27, 2020. Oprah Winfrey withdrew as executive producer of the film, after having been pressured by Simmons to cancel the release, eventually stating there were &quot;inconsistencies&quot; in Drew Dixon&#x27;s story that &quot;gave me pause&quot;. Winfrey has also said, however, that she believes the women who have accused Russell Simmons of sexual assault.

<doc id="624458" wikidata="Q7028285" url="?curid=624458" title="Nickel deposits of Finland">
<text>The Finnish [[nickel]] deposits were found in the Petsamo area near the Barents Sea. Until the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947, this was the northernmost part of Finland. In 1934 it was estimated that the deposits contained over five million tons of nickel. In 1935, Canadian and French corporations began mining operations there.

The nickel deposits were a lesser known reason for Allied and German interest in the area during World War II, as potentially of great importance for production of arms and munitions. Both the planned Franco-British support of Finland in the Winter War, and German occupation of Denmark and Norway (Operation Weserübung) were partly motivated by control of the nickel mines.

During the period between the Winter War and the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, there were disputes between Finland and the Soviet Union over mining rights in Petsamo. Finland refused to allow the Soviet Union to mine nickel in Petsamo. This was one of the causes of hostility between the Soviet Union and Finland, which led to the Continuation War. As part of the German invasion, troops from Norway occupied the Petsamo region in 1941, securing the nickel supply.

The Continuation War ended in September 1944, with the Moscow armistice of 19 September 1944. Finland ceded Petsamo to the Soviet Union. All subsequent nickel production there has been under Soviet or Russian authority.

* Ultramafic intrusions

== Deposits mined later ==
In more recent years, several small nickel deposits have been mined in other parts of Finland.

* The Stormi mine in Vammala was mined from 1960 to 1969.
* The Kotalahti mine in Leppävirta was mined from 1954 to 1987.
* The Enonkoski mine in Enonkoski was mined from 1984 to 1994.

All of these deposits were mined by Outokumpu.

* The Hitura mine in Nivala was operational in 2009.
* The Talvivaara mine in Sotkamo was to commence operations in late 2008.

<doc id="624460" wikidata="Q649280" url="?curid=624460" title="Geoffrey Hill">
<text>Sir Geoffrey William Hill, FRSL (18 June 1932 – 30 June 2016) was an English poet, professor emeritus of English literature and religion, and former co-director of the Editorial Institute, at Boston University. Hill has been considered to be among the most distinguished poets of his generation and was called the &quot;greatest living poet in the English language.&quot; 
From 2010 to 2015 he held the position of Professor of Poetry in the University of Oxford. Following his receiving the Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism in 2009 for his &quot;Collected Critical Writings&quot;, and the publication of &quot;Broken Hierarchies (Poems 1952–2012)&quot;, Hill is recognised as one of the principal contributors to poetry and criticism in the 20th and 21st centuries.

==Biography==
Geoffrey Hill was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, England, in 1932, the son of a police constable. When he was six, his family moved to nearby Fairfield in Worcestershire, where he attended the local primary school, then the grammar school in Bromsgrove. &quot;As an only child, he developed the habit of going for long walks alone, as an adolescent deliberating and composing poems as he muttered to the stones and trees.&quot; On these walks he often carried with him Oscar Williams&#x27; &quot;A Little Treasury of Modern Poetry&quot; (1946), and Hill speculates: &quot;there was probably a time when I knew every poem in that anthology by heart.&quot;

In 1950, he was admitted to Keble College, Oxford, to read English, where he published his first poems in 1952, at the age of twenty, in an eponymous Fantasy Press volume (though he had published work in the &quot;Oxford Guardian&quot;—the magazine of the University Liberal Club—and &quot;The Isis&quot;).

Upon graduation from Oxford with a first, Hill embarked on an academic career, teaching at the University of Leeds from 1954 until 1980, from 1976 as professor of English Literature. After leaving Leeds, he spent a year at the University of Bristol on a Churchill Scholarship before becoming a teaching fellow at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he taught from 1981 until 1988.

He then moved to the United States, to serve as University Professor and Professor of Literature and Religion at Boston University. In 2000, with Christopher Ricks, he was co-founder of the Editorial Institute at Boston University, dedicated to training students in editorial method. In 2006, he moved back to Cambridge, England.

Hill was a Christian. He died in Cambridge on 30 June 2016.

==Marriages==
Hill was married twice. His first marriage to Nancy Whittaker, which produced four children, Julian, Andrew, Jeremy and Bethany, ended in divorce. His second marriage to the American librettist, and Anglican priest, Alice Goodman occurred in 1987. The couple had a daughter, Alberta. The marriage lasted until Hill&#x27;s death.

==Awards and honours==
&quot;Mercian Hymns&quot; won the Alice Hunt Bartlett Prize and the inaugural Whitbread Award for Poetry in 1971. Hill won as well the Eric Gregory Award in 1961.

Hill delivered the 1998 Warton Lecture on English Poetry.

Hill was awarded an honorary D.Litt. degree by the University of Leeds in 1988, the same year he received an Ingram Merrill Foundation Award. He was also an Honorary Fellow of Keble College, Oxford; an Honorary Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge; a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature; and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 2009, his &quot;Collected Critical Writings&quot; won the Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism, the largest annual cash prize in English-language literary criticism.

Hill was created a Knight Bachelor in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to literature.

===Oxford candidacy===
In March 2010 Hill was confirmed as a candidate in the election of the Professor of Poetry in the University of Oxford, with a broad base of academic support. He was ultimately successful, and delivered his 15 lectures in the academic years 2010 to 2015. The lectures progressed chronologically, beginning with Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets and concluding with a critique of Philip Larkin&#x27;s poem &quot;Church Going&quot;.

==Writing==
Hill&#x27;s poetry encompasses a variety of styles, from the dense and allusive writing of &quot;King Log&quot; (1968) and &quot;Canaan&quot; (1997) through the simplified syntax of the sequence &quot;The Pentecost Castle&quot; in &quot;Tenebrae&quot; (1978), on to the more accessible poems of &quot;Mercian Hymns&quot; (1971), a series of 30 poems (sometimes called &quot;prose-poems&quot;, a label which Hill rejects in favour of &quot;versets&quot;) which juxtapose the history of Offa, eighth-century ruler of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia, with Hill&#x27;s own childhood in the modern Mercia of the West Midlands. Seamus Heaney said of Hill: &quot;He has a strong sense of the importance of the maintenance of speech, a deep scholarly sense of the religious and political underpinning of everything in Britain.&quot;

Kenneth Haynes, editor of &quot;Broken Hierarchies&quot;, commented: &quot;the annotation is not the hard part with Hill&#x27;s poems... the difficulty only begins after looking things up&quot;. Elegy is Hill&#x27;s dominant mode; he is a poet of phrases rather than cadences. Regarding both his style and subject, Hill is often described as a &quot;difficult&quot; poet. In an interview in &quot;The Paris Review&quot; (2000), which published Hill&#x27;s early poem &quot;Genesis&quot; when he was still at Oxford, Hill defended the right of poets to difficulty as a form of resistance to the demeaning simplifications imposed by &#x27;maestros of the world&#x27;.

Hill was consistently drawn to morally problematic and violent episodes in British and European history and has written poetic responses to the Holocaust in English, &quot;Two Formal Elegies&quot;, &quot;September Song&quot; and &quot;Ovid in the Third Reich&quot;. His accounts of landscape (especially that of his native Worcestershire) are as intense as his encounters with history. Hill has also worked in theatre – in 1978, the National Theatre in London staged his &#x27;version for the English stage&#x27; of &quot;Brand&quot; by Henrik Ibsen, written in rhyming verse. Hill&#x27;s distaste for conclusion, however, has led him, in 2000&#x27;s &quot;Speech! Speech!&quot; (118), to scorn the following argument as a glib get-out: &#x27; / traded as , he answers / as he answers móst things these days | easily.&#x27; Throughout his corpus Hill is uncomfortable with the muffling of truth-telling that verse designed to sound well, for its contrivances of harmony, must permit. The constant buffets of Hill&#x27;s suspicion of lyric eloquence—can it truly &quot;be&quot; eloquent?—against his talent for it (in &quot;Syon&quot;, a sky is &#x27;livid with unshed snow&#x27;) become in the poems a sort of battle in style, where passages of singing force (&quot;ToL&quot;: &#x27;The ferns / are breast-high, head-high, the days / lustrous, with their hinterlands of thunder&#x27;) are balanced with prosaic ones of academese and inscrutable syntax. In the long interview collected in Haffenden&#x27;s &quot;Viewpoints&quot; there is described the poet warring himself to witness honestly, to make language as tool say truly what he believes is true of the world.

==Criticism==
The violence of Hill&#x27;s aesthetic has been criticised by the Irish poet-critic Tom Paulin, who draws attention to the poet&#x27;s use of the Virgilian trope of &#x27;rivers of blood&#x27; – as deployed infamously by Enoch Powell – to suggest that despite Hill&#x27;s multi-layered irony and techniques of reflection, his lyrics draw their energies from an outmoded nationalism, expressed in what Hugh Haughton has described as a &#x27;language of the past largely invented by the Victorians&#x27;. Yet as Raphael Ingelbien notes, &quot;Hill&#x27;s England ... is a landscape which is fraught with the traces of a history that stretches so far back that it relativizes the Empire and its aftermath&quot;. Harold Bloom has called him &quot;the strongest British poet now active.&quot;

For his part, Hill addressed some of the misperceptions about his political and cultural beliefs in a &quot;Guardian&quot; interview in 2002. There he suggested that his affection for the &quot;radical Tories&quot; of the 19th century, while recently misunderstood as reactionary, was actually evidence of a progressive bent tracing back to his working-class roots. He also indicated that he could no longer draw a firm distinction between &quot;Blairite Labour&quot; and the Thatcher-era Conservatives, lamenting that both parties had become solely oriented toward &quot;materialism&quot;.

<doc id="624463" wikidata="Q579665" url="?curid=624463" title="Dextrocardia">
<text>Dextrocardia () is a rare congenital condition in which the apex of the heart is located on the right side of the body, rather than the more typical placement towards the left. There are two main types of dextrocardia: dextrocardia of embryonic arrest (also known as isolated dextrocardia) and dextrocardia &quot;[[situs inversus]]&quot;. Dextrocardia &quot;situs inversus&quot; is further divided.

==Classification==

===Dextrocardia of embryonic arrest===
In this form of dextrocardia, the heart is simply placed further right in the thorax than is normal. It is commonly associated with severe defects of the heart and related abnormalities including pulmonary hypoplasia.

===Dextrocardia situs solitus ===
Dextrocardia refers to a heart positioned in the right side of the chest. Situs solitus describes viscera that are in the normal position, with the stomach on the left side.

===Dextrocardia situs inversus===
Dextrocardia situs inversus refers to the heart being a mirror image situated on the right side. For all visceral organs to be mirrored, the correct term is dextrocardia situs inversus totalis.

Although statistically people with dextrocardia do not have any medical problems from the disorder, they may be prone to a number of bowel, esophageal, bronchial and cardiovascular disorders (such as double outlet right ventricle, endocardial cushion defect and pulmonary stenosis). Certain cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders related to dextrocardia can be life-threatening if left unchecked.

Kartagener syndrome may also be present in patients with dextrocardia but this must be in the setting of situs inversus and may include male infertility.

===Dextrocardia with situs ambiguus===

In contrast to dextrocardia situs inversus which is only rarely associated with congenital heart disease, dextrocardia situs ambiguus is often associated with intracardiac anomalies. Dextrocardia situs ambiguus presents a surgical challenge not per se due to associated cardiac malformation, but because achieving adequate exposure is difficult. Right sided structures such as right atrium, right ventricle and tricuspid valve are oriented posteriorly in dextrocardia situs ambiguus (in contrast to dextrocardia with situs inversus). This presents a challenge to the surgeons operating on the right-sided cardiac structures in a case of dextrocardia situs ambiguus.

==Diagnosis==
Medical diagnosis of the two forms of congenital dextrocardia can be made by ECG or imaging.

===Technical dextrocardia===
Technical dextrocardia refers to an ECG reading that has no basis in the patient&#x27;s anatomy. This apparent presentation is typically caused by the accidental lead placement of the left and right arm electrodes. Usually, this would show as an extreme axis deviation.

==Management==
ECG leads must be placed in reversed positions on a person with dextrocardia. In addition, when defibrillating someone with dextrocardia, the pads should be placed in reverse positions. That is, instead of upper right and lower left, pads should be placed upper left and lower right.

When heart transplantation is required in a person with situs inversus, reconstruction of the venous pathways to accommodate a normal donor heart is a major, but not insurmountable, challenge.

== Epidemiology ==
Dextrocardia is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 12,019 pregnancies.

A Japanese study of 1,753 fetal cardiac echocardiograms over five years revealed only two cases.

<doc id="624468" wikidata="Q16822724" url="?curid=624468" title="Counties of New Zealand">
<text>A system of counties of New Zealand was instituted after the country dissolved its provinces in 1876, and these counties were similar to other countries&#x27; systems, lasting with little change (except mergers and other localised boundary adjustments) until 1989, when they were reorganised into district and city councils within a system of larger regions.

==History==
The Counties Bill of 1876 was initiated to merge 314 road boards into 39 counties. However, as a result of lobbying, the number of counties had grown to 63 by the time the bill was enacted.

Counties had chairmen, not mayors as boroughs and cities had; many legislative provisions (such as burial and land subdivision control) were different for the counties. By 1966, there were 112 counties.

During the second half of the 20th century, many counties received overflow population from nearby cities. The result was often a merger of the two into a &quot;district&quot; (e.g., Rotorua) or a change of name to &quot;district&quot; (e.g., Waimairi) or &quot;city&quot; (e.g., Manukau).

The Local Government Act 1974 began the process of bringing urban, mixed, and rural councils into the same legislative framework. Substantial reorganisations under that Act resulted in the 1989 local government reforms, which covered the country in (non-overlapping) cities and districts and abolished all the counties except for the Chatham Islands County, which survived under that name for a further six years but then became a &quot;territory&quot; under the Chatham Islands Council.

The term is perpetuated in the name &quot;Counties-Manukau&quot;, which refers to areas of South Auckland and the Franklin District and adjoining districts, and is applied to bodies as diverse as football clubs and health providers.

<doc id="624475" wikidata="Q2376505" url="?curid=624475" title="Edith Cowan">
<text>Edith Dircksey Cowan (&#x27;Brown; 2 August 1861 – 9 June 1932) was an Australian social reformer who worked for the rights and welfare of women and children. She is best known as the first Australian woman to serve as a member of parliament. Cowan has been featured on the reverse of Australia&#x27;s fifty-dollar note since 1995.

Cowan was born at Glengarry station near Geraldton, Western Australia. She was the granddaughter of two of the colony&#x27;s early settlers, Thomas Brown and John Wittenoom. Cowan&#x27;s mother died when she was seven, and she was subsequently sent to boarding school in Perth. At the age of 15, her father, Kenneth Brown, was hanged for the murder of her stepmother, making her an orphan. She subsequently lived with her grandmother in Guildford, Western Australia until her marriage at the age of 18. She and her husband would have five children together, splitting their time between homes in West Perth and Cottesloe.

In 1894, Cowan was one of the founders of the Karrakatta Club, the first women&#x27;s social club in Australia. She became prominent in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, which saw women in Western Australia granted the right to vote in 1899. Cowan was also a leading advocate for public education and the rights of children (particularly those born to single mothers). She was one of the first women to serve on a local board of education, and in 1906 helped to found the Children&#x27;s Protection Society, whose lobbying resulted in the creation of the Children&#x27;s Court the following year. Cowan was a co-founder of the Women&#x27;s Service Guild in 1909, and in 1911 helped establish a state branch of the National Council of Women.

Cowan was a key figure in the creation of the King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women, and became a member of its advisory board when it opened in 1916. She was made a justice of the Children&#x27;s Court in 1915 and a justice of the peace in 1920. In 1921, Cowan was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia as a member of the Nationalist Party, becoming Australia&#x27;s first female parliamentarian. She was defeated after just a single term, but maintained a high profile during her tenure and managed to secure the passage of several of her private member&#x27;s bills.

==Early life==
Cowan was born on 2 August 1861 at Glengarry, a sheep station near Geraldton, Western Australia. She was the second child of Kenneth Brown, pastoralist and son of early York settlers Thomas and Eliza Brown, and his first wife Mary Eliza Dircksey Wittenoom, a teacher and the daughter of the colonial chaplain, Wittenoom. Cowan&#x27;s mother died in childbirth in 1868 when Cowan was only seven. She went to a Perth boarding school run by the Misses Cowan, sisters of her future husband. Her adolescence was shattered in 1876 by the ordeal of her father&#x27;s trials and hanging for the murder, that year, of his second wife. He murdered his second wife by shooting her when they were packing. Cowan was a solitary person, committed nevertheless to social reforms which enhanced women&#x27;s dignity and responsibility and which secured proper care for mothers and children.

After her father&#x27;s death, Cowan left her boarding school and moved to Guildford to live with her grandmother. There, she attended tuition of Canon Sweeting, a former headmaster of Bishop Hale&#x27;s School who had taught a number of prominent men including John Forrest and Septimus Burt. According to her biographer, Sweeting&#x27;s tuition left Cowan with &quot;a life-long conviction of the value of education, and an interest in books and reading&quot;.

==Community work==

Cowan became involved with social issues and injustices in the legal system, especially with respect to women and children. In 1894, she helped found the Karrakatta Club, a group in which women &quot;educated themselves for the kind of life they believed they ought to be able to take&quot;. In time, she became the club&#x27;s president, life member, and trustee. The Karrakatta Club became involved in the campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage, successfully gaining the vote for women in 1899.

After the turn of the century, she turned her eye to welfare issues. She was particularly concerned with women&#x27;s health and the welfare of disadvantaged groups, such as disadvantaged children and prostitutes. She became extraordinarily active in women&#x27;s organisations and welfare organisations, serving on numerous committees. The building of Perth&#x27;s King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women in 1916 was largely a result of her efforts. She helped form the Women&#x27;s Service Guilds in 1909 and was a co-founder of the Western Australia&#x27;s National Council of Women, serving as president from 1913 to 1921 and vice-president until her death. Cowan was also a Western Australian delegate to the national assembly for 19 years.

In 1916, she became a Freemason, admitted to the Australian federation of Droit Humain.

She believed that children should not be tried as adults and, accordingly, founded the Children&#x27;s Protection Society. The society had a major role in the subsequent introduction of children&#x27;s courts. In 1915, she was appointed to the bench of the new court and continued on in this position for eighteen years. In 1920, she became one of the first female Justices of the Peace. Her great great nephew David Malcolm followed in her footsteps, by becoming Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in 1988.

During World War I, she collected food and clothing for soldiers at the front and coordinated efforts to care for returned soldiers. She became chairperson of the Red Cross Appeal Committee and was rewarded when, in 1920, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

In her final years, she was an Australian delegate to the 1925 International Conference of Women held in the United States. She helped to found the Royal Western Australian Historical Society in 1926 and assisted in the planning of Western Australia&#x27;s 1929 Centenary celebrations. Though she remained involved in social issues, illness forced her to withdraw somewhat from public life in later years.

=== Community positions held ===
Beside being a Member of Parliament, Cowan held positions on many boards in Western Australia, in 1929 during the centenary &quot;The West Australian&quot; published a list of these;
==Politics==

In 1921, Western Australia passed legislation allowing women to stand for parliament. At the age of 59, she stood as the Nationalist candidate for the Legislative Assembly seat of West Perth because she felt that domestic and social issues were not being given enough attention. She won a surprise victory, defeating the Attorney-General, Thomas Draper, who had introduced the legislation that enabled her to stand. Cowan was the first woman to be elected to an Australian parliament. She campaigned for women&#x27;s rights in parliament, pushing through legislation which allowed women to be involved in the legal profession. She succeeded in placing mothers in an equal position with fathers when their children died without having made a will and was one of the first to promote sex education in schools. However, she lost her seat at the 1924 election and failed to regain it in 1927.

Cowan supported the secession of Western Australia from the federation and was active in the Dominion League. In September 1930 she spoke at the inaugural meeting of the league&#x27;s Claremont branch alongside leading secession campaigner Keith Watson. She was a delegate to the secession convention in August 1931 and successfully moved a motion calling on members &quot;to support, irrespective of party divisions, election candidates pledged to secession and to the securing of a referendum&quot;.

==Personal life==

At the age of 18, on 12 November 1879, Edith married James Cowan, then Registrar of the Supreme Court. They lived at &quot;Scotstoun&quot;, 71 Malcolm Street, West Perth for most of their lives, but are also well known for having one of the first houses in Avonmore Terrace, Cottesloe, where they lived from 1896 to 1912.
Cowan was married in St George&#x27;s Cathedral, Perth. She was one of the first women elected to the Anglican Synod in 1916.

==Death and burial==
Following an extended period of ill-health Cowan died of pancreatic cancer at the Avro Hospital, Subiaco on 9 June 1932, at the age of 70. After a short service at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, West Perth, a large public funeral was held at Karrakatta Cemetery where she was buried.

==Legacy==
Two years after her death, the Edith Cowan Memorial Clock was unveiled at the entrance to Perth&#x27;s Kings Park. Believed to be the first civic monument to an Australian woman, it was built in the face of persistent opposition which has been characterised as &quot;representative of a gender bias operating at the time&quot;.

Her portrait featured on an Australian postage stamp in 1975, as part of a six-part &quot;Australian Women&quot; series. Australia Post honoured Edith again in 2021, for the centenary of her election, as Australia’s first woman parliamentarian. During the WAY 1979 sesquicentennial celebrations, a plaque was laid in St Georges Terrace in her honour. It is on the corner of Milligan Street and is for 1921.

In 1984, the federal Division of Cowan was created and named after her, and in January 1991 the Western Australian College of Advanced Education was renamed Edith Cowan University (ECU).

Her portrait appears on the Australian fifty dollar note, a polymer banknote that was first issued in October 1995. In 2019 the release of the latest $50 note caused a sensation when it was discovered that the word &#x27;responsibility&#x27; in Edith Cowan&#x27;s speech was spelt incorrectly, missing the last &#x27;i&#x27;. In 1996, a plaque honouring her was placed in St George&#x27;s Cathedral, Perth. There are references to her in the Centenary of Western Australian Women&#x27;s Suffrage Memorial in Kings Park, and in a tapestry that was hung in King Edward Memorial Hospital in 2000 to honour women involved in the hospital.

In 1991, Edith Cowan University purchased the house in which Edith Cowan, her husband and family had resided at 71 Malcolm Street. They resided in the house from 1919 for approximately 20 years. The house was reconstructed on the university&#x27;s Joondalup campus with the assistance of the West Coast College of TAFE. The reconstructed house opened in 1997 as Building 20 on that campus, and currently houses the Peter Cowan Writer&#x27;s Centre.

Edith Cowan was added to the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2001. Her life was the subject of the stage play &quot;With Fire in Her Heart: the Edith Cowan Story&quot; by Western Australian author and playwright Trevor Todd, in 2020.

<text>Ulrike Nasse-Meyfarth (; born 4 May 1956) is a German former high jumper. She won the Olympic title twice, in 1972 and 1984. She is the youngest Olympic champion ever in women&#x27;s high jump, and at the time of her 1984 triumph, she also was the oldest ever.

==Biography==

The athletic career of Meyfarth took off quickly. In 1971, when she was only fifteen, she already placed second at the West German Championships, and the following year she qualified as the third member of the West German team for the 1972 Summer Olympics that were held in Munich.

Meyfarth was one of the few jumpers who had already adopted the new high jumping style first displayed by Dick Fosbury at the Mexico Olympics four years earlier. Not much was expected from Meyfarth, who had a 1.85-metre personal best. Yet in front of the patriotic home crowd, she rose to the occasion and improved her best by 5 cm to reach 1.90 metres – enough to secure the gold medal. She added another 2 cm to equal the standing world record and became the youngest Olympic champion in athletics in an individual event, at only 16 years old.

Her career stagnated after this surprising victory, and she did not improve on her 1.92-metre mark until 1978. She did not win any titles in the meantime, placing 7th and 5th at the 1974 and 1978 European Championships, and not reaching the final of the high jump competition at the 1976 Montreal Games. Because of the West German boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics, she did not compete there.

1982 was Meyfarth&#x27;s comeback year. She won the European championships indoor and outdoor, and set a new world record of 2.02 m on the latter occasion. In 1983, she finished second at the first World Championships, after a close fight with Tamara Bykova, whom she had beaten at the European Championships the year before. At a competition in London, both Bykova and Meyfarth cleared 2.03 m, again a new world record. Bykova added another centimetre to this mark just four days later.

The 1984 Summer Olympics event in Los Angeles was Ulrike Meyfarth&#x27;s last major championship. Several of her toughest competitors, including Bykova, were absent because most of the East Bloc nations boycotted the Olympics. She defeated the reigning Olympic champion – Italy&#x27;s Sara Simeoni – and cleared 2.02 meters to win her second Olympic title. This time, Meyfarth was the oldest woman to win the Olympic high jump title.

She started her career in the club LG Rhein-Ville, becoming the West German national silver medalist in 1971 and bronze medalist in 1972. She then moved to ASV Köln and became the West German champion in 1973, 1975, 1979, and 1980–1983. She also took another bronze in 1976 and silvers in 1978 and 1984.

==Personal life==
In 1983 she posed naked as a model for &quot;The Highjumper&quot;, a bronze sculpture by Arno Breker.
In 1987 she married Roland Nasse, a lawyer from Cologne. With him and their two daughters, she lives in Odenthal, a town north of Cologne.
Nasse-Meyfarth studied at the Deutschen Sporthochschule Köln (DSK). She is a diplomated sports teacher and since 1997 a trainer and talent scout at German sports club TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen (as of 2019).

<doc id="624505" wikidata="Q561982" url="?curid=624505" title="The Bridges at Toko-Ri">
<text>The Bridges at Toko-Ri is a 1954 American war film about the Korean War and stars William Holden, Grace Kelly, Fredric March, Mickey Rooney, and Robert Strauss. The film, which was directed by Mark Robson, was produced by Paramount Pictures. Dennis Weaver and Earl Holliman make early screen appearances in the film.

The screenplay is based on the 1953 novel &quot;The Bridges at Toko-ri&quot; by Pulitzer Prize winner James Michener. The story, which closely follows the novel, is about the U.S. Navy pilots assigned to bomb a group of heavily defended bridges in North Korea. It emphasizes the lives of the pilots and crew in the context of the Korean War; a conflict that seems remote to all except those who fight in Korea.

==Plot==
U.S. Navy Lieutenant Harry Brubaker is a Naval Reserve officer and Naval Aviator who was called back to active duty from his civilian profession as an attorney to fly F9F Panthers in the Korean War. Returning from a mission with battle damage, he is forced to ditch into the sea and is rescued by a Sikorsky HO3S-1 manned by Chief Petty Officer (NAP) Mike Forney and Airman (NAC) Nestor Gamidge.

Forney had often been in trouble for brawling and sporting a non-regulation green top hat and scarf while flying his helicopter as encouragement to downed pilots in the water. Back aboard his ship, the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Savo Island&quot;, Brubaker is called to the quarters of Rear Admiral Tarrant, the Carrier Task Force 77 commander, who has taken an interest in Brubaker because he reminds Tarrant of his son, a Navy Pilot killed in World War II. Brubaker complains about the unfairness of his recall when most actively flying/actively drilling Naval Reserve pilots weren&#x27;t recalled (Brubaker hadn&#x27;t been flying in the Reserve), America is not actually &quot;at war&quot;, and most Americans have no involvement. Tarrant advises that, &quot;All through history, men have had to fight the wrong war in the wrong place, but that&#x27;s the one they&#x27;re stuck with.&quot;

The &quot;Savo Island&quot; returns to port in Japan, where Brubaker is given a three-day shore leave in Tokyo with his wife Nancy and their children. The reunion is interrupted when Gamidge comes to Brubaker asking his help in bailing Forney out of the brig after a brawl. Nancy expresses her bewilderment to Tarrant, who explains that Forney saved her husband from freezing to death when he had to ditch his jet at sea and warns her that when they return to Korea, Brubaker will have to attack the dangerous bridges at Toko-Ri. He advises her to face the reality that Harry might be killed, which neither his wife nor daughter-in-law did, and thus were crushed by despair. Late that night Nancy asks Brubaker about the bridges.

Back on a carrier off Korea, Brubaker flies as wingman for Commander Lee, the carrier air group commander known as &quot;CAG&quot; (from his position as Commander, Air Group in the carrier), on a dangerous reconnaissance to photograph the bridges. Lee briefs his pilots on the coming mission using the film he took and Brubaker loses his nerve. However, he cannot bring himself to quit the mission or write a final letter to Nancy. Forney crosses the captain of the &quot;Savo Island&quot; once too often, and then he is exiled to a helicopter scow. As he is leaving the ship, he notices Brubaker&#x27;s distress, and relates a &quot;cure&quot; for bad nerves that has worked for him, standing on the bow of the ship and facing the waves. Brubaker follows his advice and finds renewed strength within himself.

In the attack on the bridges, the antiaircraft fire is intense, but the jets destroy the bridges without a loss. Lee then leads them to attack a secondary target, where Brubaker&#x27;s jet is hit. Leaking fuel and descending, he tries to return to the carrier, but he cannot and crash-lands on land. Forney and Gamidge attempt to pick him up, but communist troops shoot down the helicopter. Gamidge is killed, and Forney takes cover in a muddy ditch with Brubaker. They try to hold off the enemy with pistols and Forney&#x27;s and Gamidge&#x27;s M1 carbines until they can be rescued, but both are killed by the North Korean and Red Chinese soldiers. Tarrant, angered by the news of Brubaker&#x27;s death, demands an explanation from Commander Lee of why he attacked the second target. Lee defends his actions, noting that Brubaker was his pilot too, and that despite his loss, the mission was a success. Tarrant, realizing that Lee is correct, rhetorically asks, &quot;Where do we get such men?&quot;

==Production==
===Writing===
Michener based his novel on actual missions flown against the railroad bridges at Majon-ni and Samdong-ni, North Korea, during the winter of 1951–52, when he was a news correspondent aboard the aircraft carriers and . Michener based the character of Harry Brubaker on Lieutenant Donald S. Brubaker, who like his counterpart, was a 29-year-old Naval Reservist from Denver recalled to active duty aboard . The basis for Admiral Tarrant was Rear Admiral John Perry, the carrier division commander at the time; that of Lee was Commander Marshall U. Beebe, CAG aboard &quot;Essex&quot; in 1951 and technical advisor for the film; and Forney on Chief (NAP) Duane Thorin, himself a colorful enlisted pilot known for his trademark non-regulation green headgear.

The pilot&#x27;s rescue attempt at the climax of the novel and film was a composite of a pair of unrelated rescue attempts on February 8, 1952, both in the area of Wonsan, North Korea, with the second one involving a propeller-driven Douglas AD-1 Skyraider from &quot;Valley Forge&quot; that had been shot down while bombing the railroad bridges at Samdong-ni. However, though the shot-down aviators in the second attempt were initially listed as missing in action, they survived their ordeal, and they were captured by North Korean soldiers.

In the attacks against the historical bridges, the McDonnell F2H Banshee fighter-bombers (represented by Grumman F9F Panther) that are at the heart of the story did not bomb the bridges themselves, since they did not have the capability of carrying the heavy aerial bombs that were needed. Instead, they carried out the perilous mission of suppressing enemy anti-aircraft fire.

===Development===
Film rights were purchased for $100,000 by the team of George Seaton and William Perlberg, who had a production unit at Paramount. They wanted Spencer Tracy for the role of admiral, but this was played by Frederic March.

===Filming===

Exteriors were shot aboard and , 27,100-ton s standing in for USS &quot;Savo Island&quot;. The aircraft used in the film is the Grumman F9F-2 Panther, a Korean War workhorse still in service and equipping the air groups of both carriers at the time the film was made. In the novel, however, Brubaker&#x27;s squadron flew McDonnell F2H Banshees. The squadron depicted is an actual unit, Fighter Squadron 192 (VF-192) &quot;Golden Dragons,&quot; which was aboard &quot;Oriskany&quot; during the filming, and from its part in the movie, thereafter, billed itself as the &quot;World Famous Golden Dragons.&quot; VF-192 had two war deployments to Korea, but aboard and flying Vought F4U-4 Corsairs. The movie also took advantage of the early uses of helicopters in the military. Rooney&#x27;s character flies a S-51/HO3S-1/H-5F, G, H Sikorsky &quot;DragonFly&quot; which was well-known as a naval rescue aircraft.

Location filming was also done in Post-War Japan at the US Naval Base in Yokosuka, Kanagawa, and the historic Fujiya Hotel at Hakone. A ranch in Thousand Oaks, California, was also used for filming.

==Release==
Although the film was released in Canada in December 1954, it opened in the rest of the world, including the U.S., in 1955.

==Reception==
&quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri&quot; was well received by critics and public alike. As an example of the films that came out of the Korean War, it was considered more of a multi-faceted account that dealt with both ordinary seamen and command officers involved in combat. Typical of the reviews was one by Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who noted how the film adaptation was true to the original story and was &quot;vividly and movingly developed in this punctilious film.&quot; The close cooperation of the U.S. Navy led to spectacular aerial scenes as well as carrier action. A raid sequence with large scale models intercut with combat footage was a particularly effective scene that was later recognized in the Academy Awards.

===Awards and honors===
&quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Special Effects (1956) and Alma Macrorie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing (1956). Mark Robson was also nominated for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures in the Directors Guild of America Awards (1956).

=== Anti-war themes ===
Atypical of the World War II movies produced by Hollywood, &quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri&quot; was considered a quiet anti-war themed movie. The Korean War never got the same attention in media as World War II as its geopolitical purpose in world security was considered dubious. Brubaker&#x27;s character questions the purpose of the Korean War with the Rear Admiral and others. The final scenes of the movie document the hopeless deaths of the main protagonists as they lie in a muddy ditch in a foreign land. As the movie progresses through dangerous missions (ditching, flak fly throughs), Brubaker experiences moments of panic and PTSD as the Bridge mission looms closer and closer. Grace Kelly&#x27;s character being a metaphorical representation of the country&#x27;s confusion over the Korean War but remaining dutiful and unquestioning in its purpose.

===In popular culture===
In a scene from the 2021 movie &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot;, Sean Penn plays an aging actor named &quot;Jack Holden&quot; who starred with Grace Kelly in a film called &quot;The Bridges of Toko-San&quot;. Despite the name changes, this scene is an obvious allusion to William Holden and &quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri&quot; (as is Tom Waits&#x27; character, director &quot;Rex Blau&quot;, an obvious allusion to Mark Robson, director of &quot;Toko-Ri&quot;, in the same scene).

<doc id="624510" wikidata="Q1065897" url="?curid=624510" title="Tical (album)">
<text>Tical is the debut studio album by American rapper and Wu-Tang Clan member Method Man. It was released November 15, 1994, by Def Jam Recordings. It was the first Wu-Tang solo album released after the group&#x27;s debut, &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot;. Similar to all first generation solo Wu-Tang projects, &quot;Tical&quot; was mainly produced by group member RZA, who provided a dark, murky and rugged sound. The album features guest appearances from RZA, Raekwon, Inspectah Deck, as well as several affiliates, who would later appear on future group projects. In 2017, Method Man revealed on the Viceland talk show Desus &amp; Mero that the album&#x27;s title is an acronym for &quot;taking into consideration all lives.&quot;

&quot;Tical&quot; was a critical and commercial success, reaching number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and number one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums. On January 18, 1995, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and on July 13, 1995, the record was certified platinum for the shipment of one million copies in the United States. The success for the album was driven by two singles: &quot;Bring the Pain&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You / You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By&quot;.

==Background==
In 1991, rapper GZA assisted Method Man in shopping him to label executives at Cold Chillin&#x27; Records. Though this would turn out to be unsuccessful, he formed the Wu-Tang Clan with his cousins RZA and Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard, and Method Man was included in the group. Method Man went on to perform on eight of the twelve tracks on the group&#x27;s acclaimed 1993 debut album, &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot;, and even had a solo song entitled &quot;Method Man&quot;. That song as well as &quot;C.R.E.A.M.&quot;, on which he performed the chorus line, reached #69 and #60 respectively on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. These two songs had higher chart positions than any other tracks on the album, and thus caused much anticipation for Method Man&#x27;s solo career. At the time of Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s debut album, Method Man&#x27;s rhymes, charisma, and smooth, deep voice made him the group&#x27;s most visible, popular member.

With the exception of &quot;Sub Crazy&quot; and &quot;P.L.O. Style&quot;, which were co-produced by 4th Disciple and Method Man respectively, group member RZA produced &quot;Tical&quot; in its entirety – leading Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic to refer to the album as &quot;a two-man show&quot;. As with the rest of the first round of Wu-Tang albums, RZA would recreate the distinct &quot;Shaolin&quot; sound while tailoring it to the featured rapper. On &quot;Tical&quot;, his production was especially gritty, dark and murky, complementing both Method Man&#x27;s distinctly smooth-yet-rugged voice and his raps of cannabis smoking, project love, and traditional hardcore hip hop lyricism. During this time period of the Wu-Tang Clan, RZA was the sole provider of beats for all of its members, whom he would then have battle over the rights to record over them. This competitive approach to quality control would result in &quot;Tical&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Meth vs. Chef&quot;, a recorded battle between Method Man and Raekwon. &quot;Meth vs. Chef&quot; was recorded in 1993 before RZA&#x27;s 36 Chambers Studios was flooded, destroying reportedly fifteen beats per Wu-Tang Clan rapper. Many of the beats for &quot;Tical&quot; would be hastily recreated, and mixed.

==Singles==
In 1994, the lead single &quot;Bring the Pain&quot; (backed with &quot;P.L.O. Style&quot;) was released. &quot;Bring the Pain&quot; was a RZA-produced track with an understated but funky groove, capped with the ragga vocals of Booster. The single would reach number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number 1 on the Hot Dance chart. The follow-up single, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Release Yo&#x27; Delf&quot;, was a more upbeat track, and featured Wu-affiliate Blue Raspberry singing an interpolation of Gloria Gaynor&#x27;s disco anthem, &quot;I Will Survive&quot;. &quot;Release Yo&#x27; Delf&quot; reached number 98 on the Hot 100, failing to match the success of &quot;Bring The Pain&quot;, but fared better in the UK, peaking at number 45 on the Official Singles Chart. &quot;Tical&quot; remains the only Method Man album with two singles reaching the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

To continue the album&#x27;s promotion, &quot;All I Need&quot; was remixed and released as a single in the summer of 1995 as &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You/You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By&quot;. There are two remixes of this song: &quot;Razor Sharp Mix&quot; by the RZA, and the remix by Puff Daddy, both featuring Mary J. Blige. RZA&#x27;s version proved to be more successful, with its accompanying music video aiding the song to reach number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number one on the Hot Rap, Dance and R&amp;B charts. &quot;Razor Sharp Mix&quot; also won the two a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 1996.

==Critical reception==
===Initial reaction===
&quot;Tical&quot; was well received by music critics. Tracy E. Hopkins from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated: &quot;Method Man proves to be one of rap&#x27;s most formidable players. On his solo outing, &quot;Tical&quot;, the Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s standout MC wages lyrical warfare. His gripping rhymes creep out of the darkness and take listeners hostage&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote that &quot;Meth comes correct with this beamed-down-from-Planet-Mars making music that&#x27;s way darker and more disorienting than was previously thought possible&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; commented: &quot;The East coast hip hop renaissance continues apace... supremely laid-back, mooching along at a bass-weighted amble, whether it&#x27;s framing the monogamous lover&#x27;s lament of &quot;All I Need&quot; or the &#x27;I Will Survive&#x27; hook of &quot;Release Yo Self&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the album&#x27;s singles, but stated: &quot;It&#x27;s with its heaviest numbers that &quot;Tical&quot; delivers the primo goods&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Source&quot;, Mitchell Pierce described the album&#x27;s production as &quot;dark bass and distorted wails that sound like someone is being hacked to death&quot;. Pierce concluded that &quot;&quot;Tical&quot; combines verbal terrorism, tenebrous grooves and home-demo lunacy to produce a gritty production&quot;. Michael A. Gonzales from &quot;Vibe&quot; described &quot;Tical&quot; as &quot;incredible&quot;, and further stated that &quot;the production wizardry and vocal complexity build with each listen.&quot;

===Retrospect===
Although &quot;Tical&quot; failed to achieve the critical success of several other Wu-Tang solo albums of its era, such as &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot; and &quot;Liquid Swords&quot;, it has acquired a fair amount of acclaim over the years from various music writers and publications. In 1996, &quot;Select&quot; ranked it number 28 on their 100 Best Albums of the 90s list, and in 1999, &quot;Ego Trip&quot; ranked it number 12 on their list of the greatest hip-hop albums released in 1994.

In a later review for &quot;Tical&quot;, Jason Birchmeier from AllMusic praised Method Man&#x27;s charisma and RZA&#x27;s production and stated, &quot;&quot;Tical&quot; strictly spotlights the group&#x27;s two stars and does so with refreshingly straightforward flair. There&#x27;s none of the epic overreaching that mars so many rap albums of the era; rather, there&#x27;s just over a dozen tracks here, and they&#x27;re filled to the brim with rhymes and beats and little else; no pop-crossover concessions, nor any heady experimentation for the sake of experimentation. Just good ol&#x27;-fashioned hip-hop, albeit with a dark, deranged twist&quot;. In 2005, Robert Dimery included &quot;Tical&quot; on his list of &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

===Accolades===

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Tical&quot; debuted at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and number one on the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, becoming his first US top-ten album and his first number one on the latter. On July 13, 1995, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over one million copies. As of October 2009, the album has 1,613,000 copies in the United States.

<text>Reginald Noble (born April 17, 1970), better known by his stage name Redman, is an American rapper, DJ, record producer, and actor. He rose to fame in the early 1990s as an artist on the Def Jam label.

He is well known for his collaborations with his close friend Method Man, as one-half of the rap duo Method Man &amp; Redman including their starring roles in films and sitcoms which include &quot;How High&quot; and &quot;Method and Red&quot;. He was also a member of the Def Squad in the late 1990s.

==Early life==
Born on April 17, 1970, and raised in Newark, New Jersey, Redman attended Speedway Avenue School and 13th Avenue School before attending West Side High School, an experience he described as &quot;off the hook&quot;.

In 1987, Redman was expelled from Montclair State University his freshman year due to poor academic performance at age 16. Having no other options, Redman then went back home to live with his mother, Darlene Noble, who eventually kicked him out of her house for selling cocaine. Two years later, at age 18, Redman was a young DJ-MC who went by the name &quot;DJ Kut-Killa&quot;. He freestyled over funk and hip hop instrumental tracks on vinyl records in various parks and house parties around New York and New Jersey.

Redman was eventually discovered by Erick Sermon of EPMD while he was a DJ for Lords of the Underground. Sermon said when he met Redman for the first time, &quot;I knew there was something spectacular about him. Right off the bat. The next day, we talked. And within the next two or three months, he moved to Long Island, to my crib. He moved right into my apartment.&quot; After moving in with Sermon, Redman went out on tour with EPMD. While on tour with the group he did everything from carrying their bags to coming out on stage and doing rap freestyles. In 1990, at an EPMD show in New York, Redman was invited onstage by Erick Sermon where he delivered a rap freestyle that changed his life. He freestyled a song describing himself as a rapper using every letter in the alphabet, from A to Z. After this, Redman was an official rap artist and began production with Erick Sermon on his first major label album, &quot;Whut? Thee Album&quot;.

==Music career==
===&quot;Whut? Thee Album&quot; &amp; &quot;Dare Iz a Darkside&quot; (1990–1995)===
In 1990, Redman made his official debut on EPMD&#x27;s album &quot;Business as Usual&quot;, appearing on the tracks &quot;Hardcore&quot; and &quot;Brothers on My Jock&quot;.

In 1992, Redman released his debut album, &quot;Whut? Thee Album&quot;, which AllMusic noted for blending &quot;reggae and funk influences&quot; with a &quot;terse, though fluid rap style&quot;. The album peaked at number forty-nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified gold. He was named &quot;Rap Artist of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Source&quot;. Redman followed this up with his 1994 album, &quot;Dare Iz a Darkside&quot;. The first single, &quot;Rockafella&quot;, samples Leon Haywood&#x27;s &quot;I Want&#x27;a Do Something Freaky to You&quot; and George Clinton&#x27;s &quot;Flash Light&quot;, two of the most sampled songs in hip hop. Redman&#x27;s second album was notable for having most of the tracks produced by the artist himself (later on Redman would let other producers make most of his beats). During this time he used former mentor Erick Sermon to produce his records, including &quot;Pick It Up&quot; and &quot;Whateva Man&quot; from &quot;Muddy Waters&quot;.

In 1992, Redman appeared in A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s &quot;Scenario&quot; music video.

Redman released his second studio album, &quot;Dare Iz a Darkside&quot; on November 22, 1994, by Def Jam Recordings. The album debuted at 13 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Redman has said that he was on drugs during the recording of the album, and said in 2010 that he had not played the album in recent years because it was made during a particularly dark period in his life.

===&quot;Muddy Waters&quot; (1996–1997)===
On December 10, 1996, Redman released his third album &quot;Muddy Waters&quot;, which was highly praised by critics. The album featured two of his &quot;Billboard&quot;″s hit singles: &quot;Whateva Man&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Like That (My Big Brother)&quot;. The song &quot;Do What You Feel&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories&quot;. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 12, 1997. During this time, with newfound friendships with Method Man and Tupac, they both appeared on Tupac&#x27;s double album &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; on the song &quot;Got my Mind Made Up&quot;.

In 1999, Redman took part in the Hard Knock Life Tour, including a stop in Toronto at the Air Canada Centre.

===&quot;Doc&#x27;s da Name 2000&quot; &amp; &quot;Blackout&quot; (1998–1999)===

In 1998, Redman released his first collaboration album &quot;El Nino&quot; with group Def Squad. His fourth studio album &quot;Doc&#x27;s Da Name 2000&quot; was a top seller, shipping platinum in sales and exceeding his previous record of gold. It peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and had three songs (&quot;I&#x27;ll Bee Dat&quot;, &quot;Da Goodness&quot;, &quot;Let Da Monkey Out&quot;) that charted.

With his labelmate Method Man, Redman made a featured appearance on the Doc&#x27;s Da Name 2000 record on the song &quot;Well All Rite Cha&quot;. In 1999, Method Man and Redman released a collaborative album called &quot;Blackout!&quot;.

===&quot;Malpractice&quot; (2001)===
In 2001, Redman released his fifth studio album &quot;Malpractice&quot;. It reached number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA on July 21, 2001. It boasted two singles, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Dirty (I Can&#x27;t Get in da Club)&quot; and &quot;Smash Sumthin&#x27;&quot;.

===&quot;Mixtapes, Collaborations &amp; Production&quot; (2002–2006)===
Since the release of Malpractice, he has kept his fans happy by independently releasing the &quot;Ill At Will&quot; mixtapes, which feature various members of his new record label &quot;Gilla House&quot; members under Redman&#x27;s Gilla House imprint include Saukrates, Icarus, Ready Roc, E3, Young Heat, and Melanie.

Redman had his best-known international hit with Christina Aguilera, when he was featured on her 2002 single &quot;Dirrty&quot;. Around this time he was also featured on a popular remix of Pink&#x27;s track &quot;Get This Party Started&quot;. He is cited in the song &quot;&#x27;Till I Collapse&quot; as one of rapper Eminem&#x27;s favorite rappers.

Under his birthname, Reggie Noble, Redman has done production for himself, many of his crew members, and even Shaquille O&#x27;Neal on his &quot;Shaq-Fu: Da Return&quot; album.

===&quot;Red Gone Wild&quot; (2007–2008)===

In March 2007, Redman released &quot;Red Gone Wild&quot;, produced by Chris Pinset. He stated on MySpace that the reason for the long wait to drop the album was the fast-changing pace of hip hop.
On March 27, 2007, Redman confirmed on BET&#x27;s &quot;Rap City: Tha Bassment&quot; that the sequel to &quot;How High&quot;, &quot;How High 2&quot;, was currently being written. In an April 10, 2007, &quot;Onion A.V. Club&quot; interview, Redman hinted that there would be a second collaborative album with Method Man.

===&quot;Blackout! 2&quot; &amp; &quot;Reggie&quot; (2009–2010)===
&quot;Blackout! 2&quot; was announced in 2007 by Redman and was originally scheduled for release in 2008, but its release was pushed back a number of times due to numerous reasons. In early 2008, a remake of the da Hustler and Trigger tha Gambler classic &quot;Broken Language&quot; was released on the internet by the duo entitled &quot;Broken Language 2008&quot;, fueling rumors of a &quot;Blackout!&quot; sequel coming soon. This rumor was further fueled by the duo while performing in Gainesville, Florida, at the University of Florida. A &quot;Blackout!&quot; LP was scheduled for a December 9, 2008, release but was recently pushed back to the first quarter of 2009. It was finally released on May 19, 2009. It debuted at number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, at number 2 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, at number 2 on the Top Rap Albums and digital in charted number 7 on the Digital Albums charts selling 63,000 copies in its first week. The album also charted number 10 on the Canadian Albums Chart. The album has sold 160,375 copies in the United States by December 12, 2009, according to SoundScan.

In May 2009, Redman confirmed his next solo album would come out December 2009. The title for the project is &quot;Reggie Noble &quot;0&quot; 9½&quot;. The title of the album was then changed to just &quot;Redman Presents... Reggie&quot;, and three singles (&quot;Coc Back&quot;, &quot;Oh My&quot;, and &quot;Money on My Mind&quot;) were released. The first single &quot;Coc Back&quot; (which features Ready Roc) had music video filmed and released for it. But as it turns out, none of the tracks made the final cut of the album, only being promo singles. During an interview, Redman stated that Reggie Noble (Redman&#x27;s own birth name), does the album, not Redman. Redman also said that there is going to be more, &quot;poppish&quot;, type songs, rather his normal &quot;rugged&quot; and &quot;hardcore&quot; songs. After a few push backs, &quot;Redman Presents... Reggie&quot; was finally released on December 7, 2010. The first official single is &quot;Def Jammable&quot; and a video was released for the single. It has been confirmed that Redman will appear on a remix along with French rapper Soprano of &quot;Tranne Te&quot; by Italian rapper Fabri Fibra.

===2011-present: &quot;Muddy Waters Too&quot;, &quot;Mudface&quot; and &quot;3 Joints&quot;===
In June 2013, Redman announced that his next studio album &quot;Muddy Waters 2&quot; would be released in late 2013 via Entertainment One and he would release a mixtape to go along with it, which evolved into an EP titled &quot;Muddy Waters 2: The Preload&quot;. Redman has also confirmed work on &quot;Blackout! 3&quot; with Method Man with recording starting summer 2012, however, recording was pushed back to late 2014. &quot;Mudface&quot; was released on November 13, 2015, with &quot;Blackout! 3&quot; coming out after, and Method Man&#x27;s long-awaited mixtape and fifth solo album directly following these projects. Method Man and Redman are also slated to be working on a long-rumored sequel to their original stoner comedy, &quot;How High&quot;. In a HipHopDX interview in February 2017, Matt &quot;M-80&quot; Markoff confirmed the project, revealed that the sequel will be titled &quot;Too High&quot; and that he is currently looking to acquire finances for the film. An EP called &#x27;3 Joints&#x27; was released on his Gilla House label in 2020, as further work on other albums continues.

In 2021, together with producer Chris Pinset, Redman has released &quot;80 Barz&quot; music video that quickly gained almost 3,000,000 views on YouTube.

On October 7, 2024, Redman shared a cover image to &quot;Muddy Waters Too&quot; on his social media, hinting at a sequel to his acclaimed album &quot;Muddy Waters&quot;. The album was officially released on December 24, 2024.

===Hosting===
In August 2017, it was announced that Redman would host the first season of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Scared Famous&quot;, which premiered on October 23, 2017.

==Personal life==

Redman was born in Newark, New Jersey, to Darlene and Eddie Noble. His sister Rosalyn Noble is a rapper known as Roz. She has appeared on several Redman songs over the years. He is a cousin of rapper Tame One.

In 2001, Redman appeared on an episode of &quot;MTV Cribs&quot; and showcased his Staten Island home which, in contrast to the luxurious homes usually featured in the series, was described by &quot;XXL&quot; magazine as &quot;small and grimey&quot;. Speaking to &quot;Fresh Pair&quot;, Redman explained that MTV had already picked out a few houses for him to make his appearance in, but Redman did not want to appear fake, and insisted the episode be aired at his actual residence. The TV crew had to be reduced to two people because that was the only number of people that could fit in his house.

The episode, which featured the crew having to pinch two wires together because the house lacked a doorbell, and a cameo by Redman&#x27;s cousin Mr. Cream (formerly known as Sugar Bear) sleeping on the floor in a comforter, has become &quot;the most infamous, most cited&quot; episode of the show according to MTV VP of programming Nina L. Diaz. According to a 2017 interview, Redman still lived in the property and was quoted as saying &quot;It&#x27;s real small. Two bedrooms. [...] I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do with a big house&quot;.

Redman began boarding his four-month-old pit bull terrier Daddy with dog trainer Cesar Millan, with Daddy ultimately becoming Millan&#x27;s &quot;right-hand-man&quot; on his TV show &quot;The Dog Whisperer&quot;.
