<text>Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor OM FRS FRSE (7 March 1886 – 27 June 1975) was a British physicist and mathematician, who made contributions to fluid dynamics and wave theory.

==Early life and education==
Taylor was born in St. John&#x27;s Wood, London. His father, Edward Ingram Taylor, was an artist, and his mother, Margaret Boole, came from a family of mathematicians (his aunt was Alicia Boole Stott and his grandfather was George Boole). As a child he was fascinated by science after attending the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, and performed experiments using paint rollers and sticky-tape.

Taylor read mathematics and physics at Trinity College, Cambridge from 1905 to 1908. He won several scholarships and prizes at Cambridge, one of which enabled him to study under J. J. Thomson.

==Career and research==
Taylor published his first paper while he was still an undergraduate. In it, he showed that interference of visible light produced fringes even with extremely weak light sources. The interference effects were produced with light from a gas light, attenuated through a series of dark glass plates, diffracting around a sewing needle. Three months were required to produce a sufficient exposure of the photographic plate. The paper does not mention quanta of light (photons) and does not reference Einstein&#x27;s 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect, but today the result can be interpreted by saying that less than one photon on average was present at a time. Once it became widely accepted in around 1927 that the electromagnetic field was quantized, Taylor&#x27;s experiment began to be presented in pedagogical treatments as evidence that interference effects with light cannot be interpreted in terms of one photon interfering with another photon—that, in fact, a single photon&#x27;s probability amplitudes do interfere by going through both slits of a double-slit apparatus. Modern understanding of the subject has shown that the conditions in Taylor&#x27;s experiment were not sufficient to demonstrate this, because the light source was not a single-photon source, but the experiment was reproduced in 1986 using a single-photon source, and the same result was obtained.

He followed this up with work on shock waves, winning a Smith&#x27;s Prize. In 1910 he was elected to a Fellowship at Trinity College, and the following year he was appointed to a meteorology post, becoming Reader in Dynamical Meteorology. His work on turbulence in the atmosphere led to the publication of &quot;Turbulent motion in fluids&quot;, which won him the Adams Prize in 1915.
In 1913 Taylor served as a meteorologist aboard the Ice Patrol vessel &quot;Scotia&quot;, where his observations formed the basis of his later work on a theoretical model of mixing of the air.

At the outbreak of World War I, Taylor was sent to the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough to apply his knowledge to aircraft design, working, amongst other things, on the stress on propeller shafts. He also learned to fly aeroplanes and studied the stability of parachutes.

After the war Taylor returned to Trinity and worked on an application of turbulent flow to oceanography. He also worked on the problem of bodies passing through a rotating fluid. In 1923 he was appointed to a Royal Society research professorship as a Yarrow Research Professor. This enabled him to stop teaching, which he had been doing for the previous four years, and which he both disliked and had no great aptitude for. It was in this period that he did his most wide-ranging work on fluid mechanics and solid mechanics, including research on the deformation of crystalline materials which followed from his war work at Farnborough. He also produced another major contribution to turbulent flow, where he introduced a new approach through a statistical study of velocity fluctuations.

In 1934, Taylor, roughly contemporaneously with Michael Polanyi and Egon Orowan, realised that the plastic deformation of ductile materials could be explained in terms of the theory of dislocations developed by Vito Volterra in 1905. The insight was critical in developing the modern science of solid mechanics.

In 1936 he presented the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, on &quot;Ships&quot;. One of these, on &quot;why ships roll in a rough sea&quot;, was the first RI Christmas Lecture to be televised, by the BBC.

===Manhattan Project===
During World War II, Taylor again applied his expertise to military problems such as the propagation of blast waves, studying both waves in air and underwater explosions.

Taylor was sent to the United States in 1944–1945 as part of the British delegation to the Manhattan Project. At Los Alamos, Taylor helped solve implosion instability problems in the development of atomic weapons, particularly the plutonium bomb used at Nagasaki on 9 August 1945.

In 1944 he also received his knighthood and the Copley Medal from the Royal Society. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences the following year.

Taylor was present at the Trinity nuclear test, July 16, 1945, as part of General Leslie Groves&#x27; &quot;VIP List&quot; of 10 people who observed the test from Compania Hill, about 20 miles (32 km) northwest of the shot tower. By coincidence, Joan Hinton, another direct descendant of the mathematician George Boole, had been working on the same project and witnessed the event in an unofficial capacity. The cousins met at the time but later followed different paths. Joan, strongly opposed to nuclear weapons, defected to Mao&#x27;s China, while Taylor maintained that political policy was not within the remit of the scientist.

In 1950, he published two papers estimating the yield of the explosion using the Buckingham Pi theorem, and high speed photography stills from that test, bearing timestamps and physical scale of the blast radius, which had been published in &quot;Life&quot; magazine. He gave two estimates of 16.8 and 23.7 kt, close to the accepted value of 20 kt, which was still highly classified at that time.

===Later life===
Taylor continued his research after the war, serving on the Aeronautical Research Committee and working on the development of supersonic aircraft. Though he officially retired in 1952, he continued research for the next twenty years, concentrating on problems that could be attacked using simple equipment. This led to such advances as a method for measuring the second coefficient of viscosity. Taylor devised an incompressible liquid with separated gas bubbles suspended in it. The dissipation of the gas in the liquid during expansion was a consequence of the shear viscosity of the liquid. Thus the bulk viscosity could easily be calculated.
His other late work included the longitudinal dispersion in flow in tubes, movement through porous surfaces, and the dynamics of thin sheets of liquids.

Between the ages of 78 and 83, Taylor wrote six papers on electrohydrodynamics. In this work he returned to his interest in electrical activity in thunderstorms, as jets of conducting liquid motivated by electrical fields. The cone from which such jets are observed is called the Taylor cone, after him. He went on to publish two more papers, on additional topics, in 1971 and 1973. In 1972 D. H. MIchael read Taylor&#x27;s paper, on making holes in a thin sheet of liquid, at the 13th International Conferences for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics in Moscow. Taylor had suffered a stroke and could not attend. He had presented at every one of the previous conferences.

Aspects of Taylor&#x27;s life often found expression in his work. His over-riding interest in the movement of air and water, and by extension his studies of the movement of unicellular marine creatures and of weather, were related to his lifelong love of sailing. In the 1930s he invented the &#x27;CQR&#x27; anchor, which was both stronger and more manageable than any in use, and which was used for all sorts of small craft including seaplanes.

==Personal life==

Taylor married Grace Stephanie Frances Ravenhill, a school teacher in 1925. They stayed together until Stephanie&#x27;s death in 1965. Taylor suffered a severe stroke in 1972 which effectively put an end to his work. He died in Cambridge in 1975. He is buried in the churchyard of St Edward King and Martyr, Cambridge.

<text>Gaspard Bauhin or Caspar Bauhin (; 17 January 1560 – 5 December 1624), was a Swiss botanist whose &quot;Pinax theatri botanici&quot; (1623) described thousands of plants and classified them in a manner that draws comparisons to the later binomial nomenclature of Linnaeus. He was a disciple of the famous Italian physician Girolamo Mercuriale and he also worked on human anatomical nomenclature.

Bauhin described the ileocecal valve in 1588—hence the name Bauhin&#x27;s Valve or Valve of Bauhin—in the preface of his first writing, &quot;De corporis humani partibus externis tractatus, hactenus non editus.&quot; Linnaeus honored the Bauhin brothers Gaspard and Jean in the genus name &quot;Bauhinia&quot;.

== Biography ==

Jean and Gaspard were the sons of Jean Bauhin (1511–1582), a French physician who had to leave his native country on becoming a convert to Protestantism. Gaspard was born in Basel. From 1572 he studied in his hometown, Padua, Bologna, Montpellier, Paris and Tübingen. He was awarded his medical doctorate at the University of Basel in 1581, and gave private lectures in botany and anatomy. In 1581 he obtained a doctorate in medicine from the University of Basel and was in 1582 appointed to the Greek professorship at the same university, as well as in 1588 to the chair of anatomy and botany. He was later made city physician (), professor of the practice of medicine, rector of the university, and dean of his faculty. He was rector of the university of Basel in 1592, then again in 1611 and 1619; during the second rectorate the university tried in vain to win back from the city council the freedoms of 1460, which were lost in 1532.

The &quot;Pinax theatri botanici&quot; (English, &quot;Illustrated exposition of plants&quot;) is a landmark of botanical history, describing some 6,000 species and classifying them. The classification system was not particularly innovative, using traditional groups such as &quot;trees&quot;, &quot;shrubs&quot;, and &quot;herbs&quot;, and using other characteristics such as utilization, for instance grouping spices into the &quot;Aromata&quot;. He did correctly group grasses, legumes, and several others. His most important contribution is in the description of genera and species. He introduced many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus, and remain in use. For species he carefully pruned the descriptions down to as few words as possible; in many cases a single word sufficed as description, thus giving the appearance of a two-part name. However, the single-word description was still a description intended to be diagnostic, not an arbitrarily-chosen name (in the Linnaean system, many species names honor individuals, for instance).

In addition to &quot;Pinax Theatri Botanici&quot;, Gaspard planned another work, a &quot;Theatrum Botanicum&quot;, meant to be comprised in twelve parts folio, of which he finished three; only one, however, was published (1658), long after his death. He also gave a copious catalogue of the plants growing in the environs of Basel, its &quot;flora&quot;, and edited the works of Pietro Andrea Mattioli (1500–1577) with considerable additions. His principal work on anatomy was &quot;Theatrum Anatomicum infinitis locis auctum&quot; (1592).

<text>Detonating cord (also called detonation cord, detacord, detcord, blasting rope, or primer cord) is a thin, flexible plastic tube usually filled with pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN, pentrite). With the PETN exploding at a rate of approximately , any common length of detonation cord appears to explode instantaneously. It is a high-speed fuse which explodes, rather than burns, and is suitable for detonating high explosives. The detonation velocity is sufficient to use it for synchronizing multiple charges to detonate almost simultaneously even if the charges are placed at different distances from the point of initiation. It is used to reliably and inexpensively chain together multiple explosive charges. Typical uses include mining, drilling, demolitions, and warfare.

&quot;Cordtex&quot; and &quot;Primacord&quot; are two of many trademarks which have slipped into use as a generic term for this material.

== Effects ==
As a transmission medium, it can act as a downline between the initiator (usually a trigger) and the blast area, and as a trunkline connecting several different explosive charges. As a timing mechanism, detonation cord detonates at a very reliable rate (about 6,000–7,000 m/s or ), enabling engineers to control the pattern in which charges are detonated. This is particularly useful for demolitions, when structural elements need to be destroyed in a specific order to control the collapse of a building.

While it looks like nylon cord, the core is a compressed powdered explosive, usually PETN (pentrite), and it is initiated by the use of a blasting cap. Detonation cord will initiate most commercial high explosives (dynamite, gelignite, sensitised gels, etc.) but will not initiate less sensitive blasting agents like ANFO on its own. 25 to 50 grain/foot (5.3 to 10.6 g/m) detonation cord has approximately the same initiating power as a #8 blasting cap in every 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) along its entire length. A small charge of PETN, TNT, or other explosive booster is required to bridge between the cord and a charge of insensitive blasting agent like ANFO or most water gels.

==Rating==
Detonating cord is rated in explosive mass per unit length. This is expressed in grains per foot in the United States, or in grams per metre elsewhere. A &quot;grams per metre&quot; rating will be roughly one fifth the &quot;grains per foot&quot; rating. For example, &quot;50 grain det. cord&quot; refers to detonating cord which has 50 grains of explosive per foot of length—or approximately 10 g/m. This is a typical &quot;default&quot; rating for connecting charges for blasting; lighter detonating cords may be used for &quot;low noise blasting&quot; and movie special effects, while heavier cords, used where the cord is employed to have some direct explosive effect—such as for precision rock carving work—may use 50 to 250 grain/foot (10 to 50 g/m) detonating cord.

==Direct employment==
Low-yield detonating cord can be used as a precision cutting charge to remove cables, pipes, wiring, fiber optics, and other utility bundles by placing one or more complete wraps around the target. Detonation cord is used in commercial boilers to break up clinkers (solidified coal ash slag) adhering to tube structures. Also a vertical centered cord being lowered into the water of a drilled well can remove any clogging that obstructs water flow. Higher-yield detonating cord can be used to cut down small trees, although the process is very uneconomical compared to using bulk explosive, or even a chainsaw. High-yield detonating cord placed by divers has been used to remove old dock pilings and other underwater obstructions.

Creating a slipknot from detonating cord yields a field-improvised device that can be quickly employed to cut a locked doorknob off a door. Detonation cord can be taped in several rings to the outline of a military man-sized target and detonated, breaching a man-sized hole into wooden doors or light interior walls. Detonating cord is also employed directly in building demolition where thin concrete slabs need be broken via channels drilled parallel to the surface, an advantage over dynamite since a lower minimum of explosive force may be used and smaller diameter holes are sufficient to contain the explosive. Anything much more substantial than these uses requires the use of additional explosives.

==Colloquialisms==
In Filipino, the corresponding word &quot;mitsa&quot; has come to be used in the phrase &quot;mitsa ng buhay&quot;, which translates to &quot;detonating cord of [one&#x27;s] life&quot;, a metaphor for something that is very likely to cause one&#x27;s death via direct jeopardy (e.g. extreme sports, versus smoking).

<doc id="610161" wikidata="Q116213606" url="?curid=610161" title="Fantastique">
<text>Fantastique is a French term for a literary and cinematic genre and mode that is characterized by the intrusion of supernatural elements into the realistic framework of a story, accompanied by uncertainty about their existence. The concept comes from the French literary and critical tradition, and is distinguished from the word &quot;fantastic&quot;, which is associated with the broader term of fantasy in the English literary tradition. According to the literary theorist Tzvetan Todorov (&quot;Introduction à la littérature fantastique&quot;), the &quot;fantastique&quot; is distinguished from the marvellous by the hesitation it produces between the supernatural and the natural, the possible and the impossible, and sometimes between the logical and the illogical. The marvellous, on the other hand, appeals to the supernatural in which, once the presuppositions of a magical world have been accepted, things happen in an almost normal and familiar way. The genre emerged in the 18th century and knew a golden age in 19th century Europe, particularly in France and Germany.

==Definition==
Three major critical sources in French literary theory give the same fundamental definition of the concept: &quot;Le Conte fantastique en France de Nodier à Maupassant&quot; of Pierre-Georges Castex, &quot;De la féerie à la science-fiction&quot; of Roger Caillois and &quot;Introduction à la littérature fantastique&quot; of Tzvetan Todorov. In these three essays, the &quot;fantastique&quot; is defined as the intrusion of supernatural phenomena into an otherwise realist narrative. It evokes phenomena which are not only left unexplained but which are inexplicable from the reader&#x27;s point of view. In this respect, Tzvetan Todorv explains that the &quot;fantastique&quot; is somewhere between the French concept of &quot;marvellous&quot; (&quot;merveilleux&quot;), where the supernatural is accepted and entirely reasonable in the imaginary world of a non-realist narrative, and the uncanny (&quot;étrange&quot; in French), where apparently supernatural phenomena are explained according to realist precepts and accepted as normal. In an English speaking theoritical perspective, it can therefore been considered as a subgenre of fantasy.

Instead, characters in a work of &quot;fantastique&quot; are, just like the readers, unwilling to accept the supernatural events that occur. This refusal may be mixed with doubt, disbelief, fear, or some combination of those reactions. The &quot;fantastique&quot; is often linked to a particular ambiance, a sort of tension in the face of the impossible. A good deal of fear is often involved, either because the characters are afraid or because the author wants to provoke fright in the reader. However, fear is not an essential component of &quot;fantastique&quot;.

The French concept of &quot;fantastique&quot; in literature should therefore not be confused with the marvellous or fantasy (where the supernatural is posited and accepted from the outset), with science fiction (which is rational) or with horror, although these genres can be combined.

However, the English term &quot;fantastic&quot; can sometimes be used in the French sense as in the Literary Encyclopedia, since the term was translated as above in the English translation of Todorov&#x27;s essay. This is nonetheless a minority use and much of the English critical literature that discusses fantastic literature associates the word with a broader meaning related to fantasy as in the works of Eric Rabkin, Rosemary Jackson, Lucy Armitt and David Sandner. The polysemy of the word fantastic and the difference of critical traditions of each country have led to controversies such as the one led by Sanislaw Lem.

The word is also polysemous in French: a distinction must be made between the academic definition and the everyday meaning. In everyday language, the word can refer to anything to do with the supernatural. Some people use in French the term &quot;médiéval-fantastique&quot; to refer to high fantasy, but it is not a term used by academic critics.

== Related genres ==
The &quot;fantastique&quot; is often considered to be very close to science fiction. However, there are important differences between them: science fiction is not supernatural, but rational. H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, for example, is a science-fiction novel because the hero travels back in time using a machine designed for the purpose – in other words, using a technological process that, while unknown in the current state of human knowledge, is presented as technological and therefore cannot be described as supernatural.

The &quot;fantastique&quot; narratives also differs from fantasy ones, such as those by J. R. R. Tolkien, when in fact they belong to the realm of the marvellous. It should also be noted that in the English-speaking world, &quot;fantastique&quot; literature is not considered a separate genre, but rather a sub-genre of low fantasy. The &quot;fantastique&quot; then combines the same characteristics as intrusion fantasy as defined by Farah Mendlesohn. The &quot;fantastique&quot; is also related to magic realism, a genre based as well on the insertion of supernatural elements into a realistic narrative. However, the supernatural is considered normal, making magic realism a branch of the marvellous rather than the &quot;fantastique&quot;.

Tzvetan Todorov thus defines the &quot;fantastique&quot; as being somewhere between the uncanny, i.e. a reality whose limits are pushed to the limit, as in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, in which a rational analysis can be adopted, and the marvellous, where supernatural elements are considered normal: the &quot;fantastique&quot; is this in-between, this moment when the mind still hesitates between a rational and irrational explanation. As a final condition for the appearance of the &quot;fantastique&quot;, he adds a realistic universe or context: the setting must be perceived as natural in order to introduce the marks of the supernatural, and thus the hesitation that leads to the &quot;fantastique&quot;.

The Fantastique can encompass both works of the horror and gothic genres. Two representative stories might be:

* Algernon Blackwood&#x27;s story &quot;The Willows&quot;, where two men traveling down the Danube River are beset by an eerie feeling of malice and several improbable setbacks in their trip; the question that pervades the story is whether they are falling prey to the wilderness and their own imaginations, or if there really is something horrific out to get them.
* Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s story &quot;The Black Cat&quot;, where a murderer is haunted by a black cat; but is it revenge from beyond the grave, or just a cat?

The fantastique is sometimes erroneously called the Grotesque or Supernatural fiction, because both the Grotesque and the Supernatural contain fantastic elements, yet they are not the same, as the fantastique is based on an ambiguity of those elements.

In Russian literature, the &quot;fantastic&quot; (фантастика) encompasses science fiction (called &quot;science fantastic&quot;, научная фантастика), fantasy, and other non-realistic genres.

==History==

=== Origins ===
When Charles Nodier wants to invent a &quot;fantastique&quot; history, when Nerval recalls Cazotte as an initiator in spite of himself, they both refer without hesitation to &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; (also called &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;) by Apuleius (1st c. AD). The hero of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is supposed to come to a particularly mysterious region of Greece, Thessaly. The witches of this province were renowned, and the protagonist Lucius was transformed into a donkey after using the wrong ointment. A whole section of the novel, from the moment Lucius is metamorphosed to the moment he regains his primitive form, escapes the &quot;fantastique&quot; and foreshadows the future course of picaresque heroes. Only the beginning, when the witches&#x27; magic remains uncertain, could be considered &quot;fantastique.&quot; Works of &quot;fantastique&quot;, however, only began to appear in the 18th century, and this type of literature reached its golden age in the 19th century.

==== From Marvellous to Fantastique ====
Baroque (whether in the form of novels, plays or even operas) was the link between the &quot;Merveilleux&quot; of the Renaissance and the more formalized fairy tales of the Enlightenment period. The undeniable popularity of the genre was, in great part, attributable to the fact that Fairy Tales were safe; they did not imperil the soul — a serious concern for a nation which had just come out of an era of great religious persecution — and they appropriately reflected the grandeur of the Sun King&#x27;s reign. Even if fairy tales and marvellous novels don&#x27;t belong to the &quot;fantastique&quot;, they contributed to the emergence of the genre in Europe, since the creatures found in &quot;fantastique&quot; literature that invade reality often come from marvellous literature.

Cazotte is often considered as the creator of the fantastique genre in France with his novel &quot;Le Diable amoureux (The Devil in Love&quot;, 1772), sub-titled &quot;un roman fantastique&quot;, so labeled for the first time in literary history. In it, a young nobleman, Alvare, conjures up a demon who assumes the shape of a beautiful woman, Biondetta. At the end of the story, the young woman disappears, and we don&#x27;t know if she ever really existed. Another work in the same vein was &quot;Vathek&quot;, a novel written directly into French in 1787 by English-born writer William Thomas Beckford. A Byronic figure steeped in occult knowledge and sexual perversions, Beckford allegedly wrote his novel non-stop in three days and two nights in a state of trance. Finally, in 1813, the very strange &quot;Le Manuscrit Trouvé à Saragosse&quot; (&quot;The Manuscript Found in Saragossa&quot;) was published. Like Vathek, it was written directly into French by a non-French writer, the Polish count and scientist Jan Potocki.

==== Gothic Novel ====
The real source of the &quot;fantastique&quot; genre is the English Gothic novel of late 1785. In addition to the emergence of &quot;fantastique&quot; themes (ghosts, the Devil, vampires), these novels, characterised by a more pronounced atmosphere of horror, introduced the ambiguity characteristic of the genre. Among the most representative works are Horace Walpole&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot;, Matthew Gregory Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Monk&quot; (1796), Ann Radcliffe&#x27;s &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot; (1794), William Godwin&#x27;s &quot;Caleb Williams&quot; (1794), Charlotte Dacre&#x27;s &quot;Zofloya, or the Moor&quot; (1806) and Charles Robert Maturin&#x27;s &quot;Melmoth, the Wandering Man&quot; (1821).

==== Frenetic romanticism ====
In France, the discovery of English Gothic novels gave rise to a profusion of so-called &quot;frenetic&quot; novels (&quot;roman frénétique&quot;) (also known as &quot;roman noir&quot;). Still strongly influenced by the marvellous, these romantic works of the 1830s introduced a taste for horror and the macabre into the French novel.

The frenetic novel reached its apogee with the &quot;petits romantiques&quot;. Pétrus Borel, in &quot;Champavert, Contes immoraux&quot; (1833) and especially in &quot;Madame de Putiphar&quot; (1839), was even more provocative than the English writers, particularly in his indulgence in the horrible. The cruelty of &quot;Champavert&quot;&#x27;s stories foreshadows Auguste de Villiers de L&#x27;Isle-Adam. What&#x27;s more, Borel wrote a truly &quot;fantastique&quot; tale, &quot;Gottfried Wolfgang&quot; (1843).

Among the outstanding works of the French Gothic period are novels which, having been written with the aim of parodying the tales of Lewis and Radcliffe, have become authentic roman noir. The literary critic Jules Janin wrote &quot;L&#x27;âne mort et la femme guillotinée&quot; (1829). Similarly, Frédéric Soulié&#x27;s &quot;Les mémoires du Diable&quot; which combined the &quot;roman frénétique&quot; with the passions of the Marquis de Sade.

Notable works in that category include:

* &quot;Coelina, ou l&#x27;Enfant du Mystère&quot; [Coelina, or The Child Of Mystery] (1799) by François Guillaume Ducray-Duminil.
* Victor Hugo with &quot;Han d&#x27;Islande&quot; [Han Of Iceland] (1823), a bloody tale featuring a Viking warrior and a mythical bear, &quot;Bug-Jargal&quot; (1826) and the morbid and romantic &quot;L&#x27;Homme qui Rit&quot; a.k.a. &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot; (1869) about a horribly disfigured man who lived in 17th century England.

=== Birth of the real &quot;fantastique&quot; in Germany ===
&quot;Fantastique&quot; literature in the strict sense of the terme was born in Germany in the early 19th century, with Adelbert von Chamisso (Peter Schlemihl), then Achim von Arnim and E.T.A. Hoffmann. Hoffmann&#x27;s fantastique is characterised by exaltation, chaos and frenzy. The novel &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Elixirs&quot;, which claims to be a descendant of Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Monk&quot;, often incoherently accumulates episodes of very different kinds: a love story, aesthetic or political meditations, picaresque adventures, a family epic, mystical ecstasies, etc. The theme of madness and solitude is central to both Hoffmann&#x27;s and Chamisso&#x27;s work.

Hoffmann had a universal and almost continuous influence on the genre. His tales form a veritable repertoire of the &quot;fantastique&quot;, subsequently adapted by other authors and in other arts (opera, ballet, cinema).

=== The French Fantastique in the 19th Century ===

==== The Rise of &quot;fantastique&quot; in France ====
From the 1830s, Hoffmann&#x27;s tales were translated into French by Loève-Veimars and met a spectacular success. After Jacques Cazotte&#x27;s &quot;Le Diable amoureux&quot;, Nodier was one of the first French writers to write &quot;fantastique&quot; tales. However, he saw this genre as nothing more than a new way of writing marvellous stories; for him, fantastique was a pretext for dreaming and fantasy. In fact, he wrote a study on the fantastique, which shows that for Nodier the line between the marvellous and the fantastique is quite blurred. Populated by ghosts, vampires and the undead, his texts nevertheless possess the hallmarks of the fantastique: ambiguity, uncertainty and disquiet. His best-known tales are &quot;Smarra ou les démons de la nuit&quot; [Smarra, or The Demons Of The Night] (1821), a series of terrifying dream-based tales, &quot;Trilby ou le lutin d&#x27;argail&quot; (1822), &quot;La Fée aux miettes&quot; (1832). In this last work, a young carpenter is devoted to the eponymous Fairy, who may be the legendary Queen of Sheba. In order to restore her to her true form, he searches for the magical Singing Mandragore.

Then several of the greatest names in French literature stated to write in this genre. Honoré de Balzac, author of a dozen fairy tales and three fantastique novels, was also influenced by Hoffmann. Apart from &quot;L&#x27;Élixir de longue vie&quot; (1830) and &quot;Melmoth réconcilié&quot; (1835), his main fantastique work is &quot;La Peau de chagrin&quot; (1831), in which the main character has made a pact with the Devil: he buys a skin of sorrow that has the power to grant all his wishes but which, symbolising his life, shrinks every time he uses it. Despite the fantastique component, this novel is rooted in realism: Balzac uses description to paint the sights of Paris; he brings in the psychology and social situation of his characters. However, Balzac&#x27;s fantastique work is not conceived as an end in itself. At the very least, Balzac does not seek to frighten or surprise the reader, and does not involve vampires or werewolves of any kind. Rather, it is a work of reflection, set within the framework of the Comédie humaine. Through the allegorical power of his characters and situations, Balzac is above all writing philosophical tales. We can mention as well &quot;Falthurne&quot; (1820) by Honoré de Balzac, a novel about a virgin prophetess who knows occult secrets that date back to Ancient Mesopotamia. Also of note by Balzac: &quot;Le Centenaire&quot; [The Centenarian], about a man seeking higher dimensions, the aptly named &quot;La Recherche de l&#x27;Absolu&quot; [The Search For The Absolute] (1834), whose hero is an alchemist, and &quot;Melmoth Réconcilié&quot; [Melmoth Reconciled] (1835).

A great admirer of Hoffmann, Théophile Gautier is a key writer of fantastique literature. Inhabited by fantastique and the desire to escape, his tales are among the most accomplished in terms of storytelling technique. Gautier excels at keeping the reader guessing throughout his stories, and surprising them at the punch line. He wrote a number of masterpieces that regularly feature in anthologies devoted to the fantastique, such as &quot;La Cafetière&quot; (1831) and &quot;La Morte amoureuse&quot; (1836). In &quot;La Morte Amoureuse&quot;, Théophile Gautier told the story of a young priest who falls in love with a beautiful female vampire. In it, the vampire is not a soulless creature, but a loving and erotic woman. Gautier&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot; (1856) and &quot;Spirite&quot; (1866) are &quot;roman spirites&quot; which deal with the theme of life after death.

Prosper Mérimée wrote only a very small number of fantastique works (a few short stories at most), but they are of the highest quality. &quot;La Vénus d&#x27;Ille&quot; (1837), in particular, is one of the most famous short stories in the genre: it features a pagan statue that comes to life and kills a young groom on his wedding night. &quot;Lokis&quot; and &quot;Vision de Charles XI&quot; are also among his successes. Mérimée also translated Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;, and published a study on Nicholas Gogol, the master of Russian fantastique.

Guy de Maupassant is clearly one of the greatest authors of fantastique literature. His work is marked by realism, the genre in which he built his reputation, and is firmly rooted in everyday life. His recurring themes are fear, anxiety and, above all, madness, which he fell into shortly before his death. These themes can be found in his masterpiece, &quot;Le Horla&quot; (1887). In the form of a diary, the narrator recounts his anxieties caused by the presence of an invisible being. The hesitation is based on the narrator&#x27;s possible madness. In Maupassant&#x27;s work, the blend of realism and fantastique is often driven by the madness of one of the protagonists, bringing his distorted vision of the world into the real world. The Horla, a word coined by Maupassant, most likely means &quot;Out there&quot;, implying that this invisible being comes from another world. There are two versions of Le Horla by the same author: the second version ends with the main character being committed to a psychiatric hospital.

In 1839, Gérard de Nerval collaborated with Alexandre Dumas on &quot;L&#x27;Alchimiste&quot; [The Alchemist]. Mentally unhinged after a lover&#x27;s death, Nerval developed an interest in mystical beliefs, especially in his book &quot;Les Illuminés&quot;. After writing fantastique texts influenced by the German Romanticism of Goethe and Hoffmann, Gérard de Nerval wrote a major work, &quot;Aurélia&quot; (1855), in a more poetic and personal style. He also wrote another text in a similar style, &quot;La Pandora&quot; (1854).

Other notable works at that time include:

*Cyprien Bérard&#x27;s &quot;Lord Rutwen ou les Vampires&quot; (1820), which was adapted into a stage play by Charles Nodier the same year, and starred John William Polidori&#x27;s vampire character Lord Ruthven.
* The three-volume &quot;La Vampire&quot; (1825) by Étienne-Léon de Lamothe-Langon which tells the story of a young Napoleonic army officer who bring his Hungarian fiancée home to later discover that she is a vampire, and &quot;Le Diable&quot; [The Devil] (1832) featuring the charismatic, evil Chevalier Draxel.
* Rustic legends of the Alsace were also the main source of inspiration of Émile Erckmann and Alexandre Chatrian, a writing team who signed their works Erckmann-Chatrian. Their first collection, &quot;Les Contes Fantastiques&quot; [Fantastic Tales] (1847), includes the classic short story &quot;L&#x27;Araignée Crabe&quot; [The Crab-Spider], about a blood-sucking lake monster with the body of a spider and the head of a man.
* Alexandre Dumas, père was finely attuned to the literary marketplace. The success of Hoffmann&#x27;s &quot;Tales&quot; and of the &quot;Thousand And One Nights&quot; influenced him to write &quot;Les Mille et Un Fantômes&quot; [A Thousand And One Ghosts] (1849), an anthology of macabre tales. Dumas wrote his own version of Lord Ruthwen in &quot;Le Vampire&quot; (1851). Finally, in 1857, he penned one of the first modern werewolf stories, &quot;Le Meneur de Loups&quot; [The Leader Of Wolves].
* Edgar Quinet wrote &quot;Ahasvérus&quot; (1833), a lengthy and sophisticated poetic narrative about the Wandering Jew.
* Eugène Sue&#x27;s own Wandering Jew narrative, &quot;Le Juif Errant&quot; [The Wandering Jew], was serialized in 1844–45. Dumas&#x27; &quot;Isaac Laquedem&quot; appeared in 1853.
* Paul Féval, père was one of the most important &quot;fantastique&quot; writers of the period with &quot;Les Revenants&quot; [Revenants] (1853), &quot;La Fille du Juif Errant&quot; [The Daughter Of The Wandering Jew] (1864), the macabre &quot;La Vampire&quot; [The Vampire Countess] (1867), and &quot;La Ville Vampire&quot; [The Vampire City] (1874) which parodied Ann Radcliffe, making her the book&#x27;s fictional heroine.

==== Fin de Siècle Symbolism and Fantastique ====
The end of the 19th century saw the rise of so-called &quot;decadent&quot; literature, whose favourite themes were cruelty, vice and perversity. In the wake of works such as Joris-Karl Huysmans&#x27; &quot;À rebours&quot; [Against Nature] (1884), &quot;Là-Bas&quot; [Down There] (1891) and Jules Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly&#x27;s &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot;, fantastique was no longer an end in itself, but a means of conveying a provocation, a denunciation or an aesthetic desire. During this period, there were no longer any &quot;fantastique writers&quot;, but many authors who wrote a few fantastique texts. Tales became more mannered, descriptions became richer, and exoticism and eroticism became important elements. Finally, the fantastique tale provided an opportunity for social criticism, often directed against bourgeois materialism, as in Villiers de L&#x27;Isle-Adam&#x27;s &quot;Contes cruels [Cruel Tales] (1883) and Tribulat Bonhomet (1887)&quot;. The decadent Symbolists also made extensive use of fantastique in their tales, which were not far removed from fable and allegory.

Léon Bloy wrote two collections of stories, &quot;Sueurs de sang&quot; (1893) and &quot;Histoires désobligeantes&quot; (1894). Although not all his stories are fantastique, they do have a strange or supernatural ring to them. Writing in an incendiary style, Bloy was determined to shock his readers with the cruelty of his stories. Another writer who made anything cruel, unhealthy or sordid his favourite source of inspiration was Jean Lorrain, author of &quot;Monsieur de Phocas&quot;, one of the key works of fin de siècle literature. His many fantastique tales can be found in several collections, the best of which is undoubtedly &quot;Histoires de masques&quot; (1900). We can mention as well &quot;Buveurs d&#x27;Âmes&quot; [Soul Drinkers] (1893), &quot;Les contes d&#x27;un buveur d&#x27;éther&quot; and the kabbalistic novel &quot;La Mandragore&quot; (1899).

The Symbolist author Marcel Schwob, hardly unmoved to the deleterious atmosphere of decadent works, managed to reconcile this aesthetic with the vein of the fantastic. Using the marvellous and the power of allegory, he wrote two collections of tales, &quot;Cœur Double&quot; (1891) and &quot;Le Roi au masque d&#x27;or&quot; (1892). The collection &quot;Histoires magiques&quot; (1894) by another symbolist writer, Rémy de Gourmont, in which the influence of Villiers de L&#x27;Isle-Adam is undeniable, is also worth mentioning, and is the only one by its author to contain fantastique tales.

In 1919, Henri de Régnier wrote a collection of three important fantastique stories, &quot;Histoires incertaines&quot;, whose aesthetic is directly influenced by fin de siècle literature.

Other notable works of this category include:

* Octave Mirbeau&#x27;s sadistic and mean-spirited tales of murders, cannibalism and ghostly revenge collected in &quot;Le Jardin des Supplices&quot; [Torture Garden] (1899).
* Also from Belgium, Franz Hellens, a precursor of the surrealists, displayed a lyrical, romantic approach to fantasy. &quot;Les Hors-le-Vent&quot; [The Out-Wind] (1909) and &quot;Nocturnal&quot; (1919) explored into the land of dreams, which he dubbed the &quot;second life&quot;, while his novel &quot;Mélusine&quot; (1920) was generally considered a pre-surrealist novel.

=== Victorian England ===
Victorian England produced few fantastique writers in the strict sense of the term, as the subtle ambiguities inherent in the genre found little echo in the English literary tradition. Thomas de Quincey&#x27;s short stories, for example, are more clearly in the tradition of the Gothic novel than that of fantastique. The Irishman Sheridan Le Fanu wrote &quot;Carmilla&quot; (1871), a Gothic novel whose originality lies in the character of the homosexual female vampire. It inspired the famous &quot;Dracula&quot; by his compatriot Bram Stoker (1897), the undisputed masterpiece of vampire stories. Oscar Wilde also wrote one of the most famous Anglo-Saxon fantastique novels, &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; (1891), in which the main character sees his portrait age and take on every mark of his vices, while he possesses eternal youth and indulges in every excess. In this text, Wilde develops his thoughts on aestheticism and depicts the conflict between physical and moral decay. Sensuality and homosexuality also permeate the work. Far beyond the realm of fantastique, this novel had a strong influence on French literature, particularly on decadent writers. Oscar Wilde also wrote a parody of a ghost story, &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot; (1887).

One British writer, Arthur Llewelyn Jones, also known as Arthur Machen, was born on 3 March 1863 in Wales and died on 15 December 1947 (aged 84) in England. He is particularly associated with fantastique literature, notably with his first novel, &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; (1894). The Anglo-American writer Henry James regularly tackled fantastique in the course of his literary career, and more specifically ghost stories. His most accomplished work is &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; (1898), a benchmark in the art of vacillating between rational and irrational explanations. James&#x27;s allusive style leads the reader to doubt each of the protagonists in turn, so that the ultimate truth of the story is not revealed at the end; that choice is left to the reader. This book is also remarkable for the ghostly nature of its characters.

Other famous writers have penned some fantastique texts, including Robert Louis Stevenson (&quot;Dr Jeckyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, &quot;Markheim&quot;, &quot;Olalla&quot;) and Rudyard Kipling.

This period also saw the birth of new genres of popular literature close to the fantastique: mystery fiction with Wilkie Collins, science fiction with H. G. Wells and Mary Shelley, and fantasy with William Morris and George MacDonald.

=== American Fantastique ===
At its birth in the early 19th century, American literature was strongly influenced by the English Gothic novel and fantastique. Nathaniel Hawthorne, then Washington Irving and above all Edgar Allan Poe also made the short story and the tale their preferred forms of expression. Poe also played a special role in developing his own aesthetic theory. He was also one of the pioneers of science fiction and detective fiction. Washington Irving, one of the first great American writers, wrote many tales that were closer to legend than to the supernatural strictly speaking. He is characterised by his realism and ironic tone. His best-known collection is the &quot;Sketch Book&quot; (1819), which contains the tale of Rip Van Winckle, one of the first two truly original American works of fantastique, along with William Austin&#x27;s &quot;Peter Rugh, the Missing&quot; (1824).

Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote a number of works involving the supernatural. They are marked by oppression in Puritan America, and have the recurring theme of curses, in reference to legends of witchcraft. Although fantastique occupies little space in his abundant output, Francis Marion Crawford is the author of a collection of high quality in the genre, &quot;Wandering Ghosts&quot; (1891). While drawing on this tradition, H. P. Lovecraft gave it a particular twist, closer to horror. Lovecraft went on to inspire many twentieth-century authors, including Stephen King.

=== Russian Fantastique ===
Alexander Pushkin introduced the fantastique genre to Russia with his famous short story &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; (1834). From then on, fantastique became a favourite genre in Russian literature, finding its themes in folk tales and legends. Works such as Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Family of Vourdalak&quot; and Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s &quot;The Frightful Vengeance&quot; are examples of fantastique that is close to the marvellous, a character of its own in realist works marked by deep concern and greater sincerity than the literary masterpieces that emerged from the fantastique &quot;craze&quot;, particularly in France. Such is the case with Gogol&#x27;s &quot;The Cloak&quot; and Nikolai Leskov&#x27;s &quot;The White Eagle&quot;. This realism was to be found much later in Andrei Biely&#x27;s novel &quot;Petersburg&quot; and in Fyodor Sologub&#x27;s &quot;The Petty Demon&quot;.

Encouraged by Pushkin, Nicholai Gogol published some fantastique tales, the most famous of which are &quot;The Nose&quot; and &quot;The Diary of a Madman&quot;, published in the collection of Petersburg short stories. These stories introduced a rather profound change in the nature of the fantastique tradition. Fear played a negligible role, but the absurd and the grotesque became an essential element. This new style was emulated in Russia itself: &quot;The Double&quot;, one of Dostoyevsky&#x27;s first novels, was directly inspired by Gogol&#x27;s work.

=== Fantastique in German Expressionism ===
The beginning of the 20th century saw the rise of dark, pessimistic fantastique in German-speaking countries. The works published during this period became sources of inspiration for the expressionist cinema that was developing in Germany. Gustav Meyrink (1868-1932) was one of the greatest fantastique writers of the period. A great lover of the occult, he distilled occultist theories in his novels with the aim of initiating his readers. His most famous novel, &quot;The Golem&quot; (1915), was inspired by the Kabbalah. It depicts a degraded and miserable humanity in the Jewish quarter of Prague. His other major fantastique novel was &quot;Walpurgis Night&quot; (1917). Its theme is violence and collective madness, and it echoes the butchery of the First World War.

A more controversial figure, Hanns Heinz Ewers is the author of an abundant oeuvre which, although it often veers more towards the uncanny than the fantastique, remains largely in the realm of the supernatural. With a pronounced penchant for the macabre, blood and unhealthy eroticism, his works are intended to be provocative and have often been judged immoral. Ewers is best known for his novel &quot;Mandragore&quot;. He wrote another significant novel, &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (1909), as well as numerous short stories, the best known of which is &quot;The Spider&quot; (1907).

In 1909, the Austrian writer and illustrator Alfred Kubin published a single fantastique novel, &quot;The Other Side&quot;, which reflects the nightmarish atmosphere of his drawings. This novel, in which dreams and reality form an inextricable skein, is considered by Peter Assman, Kubin&#x27;s main biographer, to be &quot;an essential step in the development of European fantastique literature&quot;.

Other important fantastique works written during this period include Leo Perutz&#x27;s &quot;The Marquis of Bolibar&quot; and Alexander Lernet-Holenia&#x27;s &quot;Baron Bagge&quot;. It was also during this period that Franz Kafka wrote &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, often considered to be a fantastique short story.

=== Belgian Fantastique ===
The development of a particular kind of fantasy literature in Belgium in the 20th century is a curious but indisputable fact. It is all the more important to mention it because fantastique plays a central role in Belgian literature in general. Belgian fantastique emerged from symbolism and realism at the end of the nineteenth century. Symbolism created an atmosphere conducive to the intrusion of the supernatural, whether through allegory, enchantment or allusiveness. The major work of this movement is &quot;Bruges-la-Morte&quot; by Georges Rodenbach (1892). Alongside symbolism, a realist and rustic movement developed, whose main representative was Georges Eekhoud. Marked by a realism of excess and hyperbole, his work includes a major collection, &quot;Cycles patibulaires&quot; (1892).

Two writers helped bring Belgian fantastique to maturity: Franz Hellens and Jean Ray. The former, alternating between symbolism and realism, distinguished himself in a genre that is sometimes described as &quot;magic realism&quot;. His main works are &quot;Nocturnal&quot; (1919) and &quot;Les réalités fantastiques&quot; (1923). Jean Ray was a true innovator of supernatural literature in the 20th century. He has the particularity of having considered the fantastique genre as a whole, and devoted himself exclusively to it. He began his career as a pulp writer, using a variety of aliases, and had several stories published in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. He is the author of an unbridled fantastique whose greatest success is &quot;Malpertuis&quot; (1943) and he wrote short stories steeped in the rich, mist-shrouded atmosphere of his native Flanders. Finally, Michel de Ghelderode, in addition to his impressive theatrical work, also wrote &quot;Sortilèges&quot; (1945), a collection of fantastique short stories that is one of the masterpieces of the genre.

=== The French Fantastique in the 20th Century ===

==== 20th century prior to World War II ====
The confidence displayed by French Society in the early 1900s was sapped by the slaughter of World War I: the Dadaist and Surrealist movements expressed a desire to break violently with the past. In 1924, the André Breton&#x27;s &quot;Manifesto of Surrealism&quot;, inspired by Freudian discoveries, challenged the realist attitude, contested the reign of logic and called for imagination and dreams to regain their rights. Breton, however, said little about fantastique. Indeed, the surrealism generally favours the marvellous over the fantastique even if it influenced the genre. A non-literary influence on the fantastique writers was that of Sigmund Freud.

Some of the major contributors of the period include:
* In &quot;La Révolte des anges&quot; [The Revolt Of The Angels] (1914), Anatole France wrote a startling tale in which the Fallen angel Arcade schemes to organize a new revolt among the fallen angels who are living on Earth, posing as artists.
* Blaise Cendrars openly declared his admiration for Gustave Le Rouge. His &quot;La Fin du Monde Filmée par l&#x27;Ange&quot; [The End Of The World Filmed By An Angel] (1919) and &quot;Moravagine&quot; (1926) are surrealist novels, the latter named after, and telling the story of, an evil madman whose crimes rival those of Fantômas, a character much appreciated by the Surrealists.
* The Faustian &quot;Marguerite de la Nuit&quot; [Marguerite Of The Night] (1922), by Pierre Mac Orlan, was also made into a film.
* Jules Supervielle, a writer of Basque descent, incorporated Hispanic vistas and fantasy themes in his novel &quot;L&#x27;Enfant de la Haute Mer&quot; [The Child From The High Sea] (1931).
* Playwright Jean Giraudoux combined tragedy, humor and fantasy in &quot;Intermezzo&quot; (1937), where a timid ghost revolutionizes a small town, and &quot;Ondine&quot; (1939) about a water sprite who falls in love with a mortal.
* Julien Gracq&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Castle of Argol&quot; (1938) combined the effects of the roman noir with the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud. The book takes place in a Gormenghast-like castle where the young owner, his friend and the beautiful Heide spend their time playing morbid and decadent games. In 1951, Gracq published the brilliant &quot;The Opposing Shore&quot; (1951) which won the Prix Goncourt and takes place in the fictional country of Orsenna.

===== Fantastique Feuilletons =====
Between the wars, the &quot;fantastique&quot; catered to the masses by providing cheap entertainment in the form of &quot;feuilletons&quot; such as &quot;Le Journal des Voyages&quot; (1877–1947), &quot;Lectures Pour Tous&quot; (1898–1940) and &quot;L&#x27;Intrépide&quot; (1910–1937) and paperbacks from publishers such as Ollendorff, Méricant, Férenczi and Tallandier. Significant names of the times include:

* Gaston Leroux with &quot;La Double Vie de Theophraste Longuet&quot; [The Double Life Of Theophraste Longuet] (1903), in which a retired merchant is possessed by the spirit of 18th century French highwayman Cartouche; the Hoffmannesque &quot;L&#x27;Homme qui a Vu le Diable&quot; [The Man Who Saw The Devil] (1908); the classic &quot;Le Fantôme de l&#x27;Opéra&quot; a.k.a. &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1910) and &quot;Le Coeur Cambriolé&quot; [The Burglared Heart] (1920).
* André de Lorde, nicknamed the &quot;Prince of Terror&quot;, a prolific playwright who wrote over one hundred and fifty plays for the Grand Guignol theater, collected in various volumes, including &quot;Théâtre d&#x27;Épouvante&quot; [Theater Of Horror] (1909), &quot;Théâtre Rouge&quot; [Red Theater] (1922), &quot;Les Drames Célèbres du Grand-Guignol&quot; [Famous Tragedies Of The Grand-Guignol] (1924) and &quot;Théâtre de la Peur&quot; [Theater Of Fear] (1924).
* Claude Farrère, the first recipient of the French Prix Goncourt literary award, wrote &quot;La Maison des Hommes Vivants&quot; [The House Of Living Men] (1911) in which a sect of immortals, founded by the Count of St Germain, steals others&#x27; life forces in order to preserve their own immortality.
* One of the most distinctive genre writers of the 1930s, who also blended genres with deceptive facility, was Pierre Véry, whose mystery novels always incorporated surreal or supernatural elements. Some of his works squarely belonged in the fantasy genre, such as &quot;Le Pays sans Étoiles&quot; [The Starless Country] (1945) and &quot;Tout Doit Disparaître le 5 Mai&quot; [Everything Must Go On May 5] (1961), a collection of fantastic tales.

==== 20th century post World War II ====
World War II exacted both a huge physical and psychological toll on French culture. France&#x27;s defeat in 1940, followed by four years of occupation, confronted writers with choices they never before had to face. The discovery of the atom bomb and the Cold War introduced sharp new fears. Mainstream French culture increasingly frowned upon works of imagination and preferred instead to embrace the more naturalistic and political concerns of the existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. Yet, paradoxically, despite being marginalized by critics and the literary establishment, the &quot;fantastique&quot; thrived as never before, both in terms of quality and quantity.

Significant foreign influences on French modern &quot;fantastique&quot; include Franz Kafka, Jorge Luis Borges, H. P. Lovecraft, Dino Buzzati, Julio Cortázar, Vladimir Nabokov and Richard Matheson. Other more recent influences included Stephen King, Clive Barker, none of whom were well known in France before the early 1980s. In Latin America of the 21st century, authors such as César Aira, Roberto Bolaño, José Baroja, Andrés Neuman, Juan Gabriel Vásquez, Jorge Volpi, among others, stand out.

Some of the most interesting authors and works up to the 1980s are:

* Marcel Béalu&#x27;s fantasy followed the path of Hoffman, Poe and Gérard de Nerval. In his stories, hapless souls became slowly trapped in dream-like realities where inhuman forces held sway. &quot;L&#x27;Expérience de la Nuit&quot; [The Experience Of Night] (1945) deals with the power to see into other dimensions. &quot;L&#x27;Araignée d&#x27;Eau&quot; [The Water Spider] (1948) is about an impossible love between a man and a watery creature who slowly turns into a girl.
* Marcel Brion&#x27;s approach of the supernatural almost always referred to the romantic tradition and the search for a mystical absolute. His most famous collection of stories is &quot;Les Escales de la Haute Nuit&quot; [The Shore Leaves Of The Deepest Night] (1942).
* André Pieyre de Mandiargues&#x27; gift was to make the invisible visible with an implacable sense of logic and an almost maniacal precision. His stories are collected in &quot;Le Musée Noir&quot; [The Black Museum] (1946) and &quot;Soleil des Loups&quot; [The Sun Of The Wolves] (1951).
* André Dhôtel used adolescents as protagonists to make us experience wondrous events, always presented in a disturbingly matter-of-fact way, in &quot;La Chronique Fabuleuse&quot; [The Fabulous Chronicle] (1955) and &quot;Le Pays où l&#x27;on n&#x27;arrive Jamais&quot; [The Unreachable Country] (1955).
* Noël Devaulx&#x27; own brand of fantastique relied of the intrusion of strange and unexplainable into everyday reality. His short stories were dubbed &quot;parables without keys.&quot; His best collections are &quot;L&#x27;Auberge Parpillon&quot; [The Parpillon Inn] (1945) and &quot;Le Pressoir Mystique&quot; [The Mystic Press] (1948).
* In 1954, publisher Fleuve Noir launched a dedicated horror imprint, &quot;Angoisse&quot;, which continued monthly until 1974, publishing a total of 261 horror novels, including books by , B. R. Bruss, Maurice Limat, Kurt Steiner, André Caroff&#x27;s &quot;Madame Atomos&quot; series and Jean-Claude Carrière&#x27;s series of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; novels.
* The prolific Claude Seignolle&#x27;s brand of &quot;fantastique&quot; was influenced by his &quot;sorcerous childhood&quot; spent in the misty plains of his native Sologne, and a terrifying encounter with the Devil incarnated in a local warlock which he claimed to have experienced at age 15 in 1932. This conferred a real sense of authenticity to Seignolle&#x27;s books, which were almost devoid of any literary artifices. His major works include &quot;La Malvenue&quot; [The Illcome] (1952) and the collections &quot;Histoires Maléfiques&quot; [Maleficent Tales] (1965) and &quot;Contes Macabres&quot; [Macabre Stories] (1966).

== Analysis ==
For Todorov, the fantastique requires the fulfillment of three conditions. First, the text must oblige the reader to consider the world of the characters as a world of living persons and to hesitate between a natural or supernatural explanation of the events described. Second, this hesitation may also be experienced by a character; thus the reader&#x27;s role is so to speak entrusted to a character, and at the same time the hesitation is represented, it becomes one of the themes of the work—in the case of naive reading, the actual reader identifies himself with the character. Third, the reader must adopt a certain attitude with regard to the text: he will reject allegorical as well as &quot;poetic&quot; interpretations. The fantastique also explores three conditions; reader’s hesitation, hesitation may be felt by another character, and the reader must have a certain mindset when reading the text. There is also a system to the fantastique that he explores that uses three properties. The utterance which discusses the use of figurative discourse, how everything figurative is taken in a literal sense. The supernatural begins to exist within the fantastique due to exaggeration, figurative expression being taken literal, and how the supernatural originates from the rhetorical figure. Leading into the second property, the act of uttering. In this property, it is most connected to the narrator of the story and the idea (discourse-wise) is that the narrator/character must pass this &quot;test of truth&quot;. The narrator is someone who cannot &quot;lie&quot;; they explain the supernatural (marvelous), but doubt in what they say creates the fantastique. The final property is the syntactic aspect. Penzoldt’s theory is what focuses on this property the most.

The fantastique can also represent dreams and wakefulness where the character or reader hesitates as to what is reality or what is a dream. Again the fantastic is found in this hesitation—once it is decided the fantastique ends.

<text>In number theory, a branch of mathematics, a cusp form is a particular kind of modular form with a zero constant coefficient in the Fourier series expansion.

==Introduction==
A cusp form is distinguished in the case of modular forms for the modular group by the vanishing of the constant coefficient &quot;a&quot;0 in the Fourier series expansion (see &quot;q&quot;-expansion)

:formula_1

This Fourier expansion exists as a consequence of the presence in the modular group&#x27;s action on the upper half-plane via the transformation

:formula_2

For other groups, there may be some translation through several units, in which case the Fourier expansion is in terms of a different parameter. In all cases, though, the limit as &quot;q&quot; → 0 is the limit in the upper half-plane as the imaginary part of &quot;z&quot; → ∞. Taking the quotient by the modular group, this limit corresponds to a cusp of a modular curve (in the sense of a point added for compactification). So, the definition amounts to saying that a cusp form is a modular form that vanishes at a cusp. In the case of other groups, there may be several cusps, and the definition becomes a modular form vanishing at &quot;all&quot; cusps. This may involve several expansions.

==Dimension==
The dimensions of spaces of cusp forms are, in principle, computable via the Riemann–Roch theorem. For example, the Ramanujan tau function &quot;τ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) arises as the sequence of Fourier coefficients of the cusp form of weight 12 for the modular group, with &quot;a&quot;1 = 1. The space of such forms has dimension 1, which means this definition is possible; and that accounts for the action of Hecke operators on the space being by scalar multiplication (Mordell&#x27;s proof of Ramanujan&#x27;s identities). Explicitly it is the modular discriminant

:formula_3

which represents (up to a normalizing constant) the discriminant of the cubic on the right side of the Weierstrass equation of an elliptic curve; and the 24-th power of the Dedekind eta function. The Fourier coefficients here are written
formula_4
and called &#x27;Ramanujan&#x27;s tau function&#x27;, with the normalization &quot;τ&quot;(1) = 1.

==Related concepts==
In the larger picture of automorphic forms, the cusp forms are complementary to Eisenstein series, in a &quot;discrete spectrum&quot;/&quot;continuous spectrum&quot;, or &quot;discrete series representation&quot;/&quot;induced representation&quot; distinction typical in different parts of spectral theory. That is, Eisenstein series can be &#x27;designed&#x27; to take on given values at cusps. There is a large general theory, depending though on the quite intricate theory of parabolic subgroups, and corresponding cuspidal representations.

Consider formula_5 a standard parabolic subgroup of some reductive group formula_6 (over formula_7, the adele ring), an automorphic form formula_8 on formula_9 is called cuspidal if for all parabolic subgroups formula_10 such that formula_11 we have formula_12, where formula_13 is the standard minimal parabolic subgroup. The notation formula_14 for formula_5 is defined as formula_16.

<text>Glasgow Royal Concert Hall is a concert and arts venue located in Glasgow, Scotland. It is owned by Glasgow City Council and operated by Glasgow Life, an agency of Glasgow City Council, which also runs Glasgow&#x27;s City Halls and Old Fruitmarket venue.

==History==

Built as the Glasgow International Concert Hall, the Royal Concert Hall is one of the largest halls in the United Kingdom. It was granted Royal status shortly before it was officially opened on 5 October 1990 at a gala performance attended by Anne, Princess Royal.

It is the replacement for the acclaimed St. Andrew&#x27;s Hall, adjacent to the Mitchell Library, which had been destroyed by fire in 1962, and was promoted and constructed in time for the city being recognised in the 1980s as the European City of Culture. The Concert Hall stands at the junction of Buchanan Street, Sauchiehall Street and the former Parliamentary Road, which the building stands partially atop. The entire complex, which includes the adjoining Buchanan Galleries shopping mall which was constructed in the late 1990s – was built over a former residential area which was demolished as part of the &quot;comprehensive development&quot; of Townhead and Cowcaddens in the 1960s.

The building incorporates a performers` entrance in West Nile Street, and public entrances in Buchanan street and in Killermont Street, with the RSNO Centre added in later years. The auditorium area is insulated by a massive rubber membrane built into the floor – damping out noise and vibration from the Subway tracks which run underneath.

The Glasgow International Concert Hall was officially opened on 5 October 1990 by Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal. The Royal Scottish National Orchestra (then the Scottish National Orchestra) gave the very first performance at the Royal Gala Opening Concert, as a showpiece for Glasgow being awarded the European City of Culture. The programme featured two new works by Scottish composers, &quot;Carillon&quot; by Thomas Wilson and &quot;Rainbow 90&quot; by Thea Musgrave, both specially commissioned for the occasion by Glasgow City Council, as well as pieces by Beethoven and Vaughan Williams. On the day prior, public concerts were given by the Band of Her Majesty&#x27;s Royal Marines, with proceeds being donated to the RNLI, which also demonstrated how the stage and the floor levels can be changed to suit performances. The first non-classical concert was by The Blue Nile. The hall has been granted Royal Status and renamed Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.

==History and Architecture==
The building was designed by modernist architect Sir Leslie Martin of South Bank, London, with some of the conceptual ideas for the building dating as far back as the mid 1960s. Some of the basic thinking behind the scheme had been directly influenced by the Bruce Report, which had proposed dividing the city centre up into distinct zones for various types of activity once slum housing had been cleared. In 1964, Glasgow Corporation had already envisioned a new civic square which would be created following the planned closure and demolition of Buchanan Street railway station (which by this time had been decided as part of the Beeching Cuts). The new square would effectively be a superblock created by realigning Parliamentary Road to an approximate east-west axis (making it essentially an extension of Renfrew Street), and also realigning North Hanover Street so it ran directly north-south. Conceptual drawings from the period showed that the square would have looked very similar to Lincoln Center in New York City, containing an art gallery, civic theatre, concert hall and repertory theatre. 

With Leslie Martin appointed as project architect, later plans showed that the proposed new technical college along the north side of the site on Cowcaddens Road would occupy part of the site – this would eventually be built as Glasgow College of Technology (now Glasgow Caledonian University) in 1971. By 1968, the scheme had been revised further and scaled down considerably. A decision to close and consolidate two bus stations (Dundas Street and Killermont Street) into one, resulted in the newly created superblock being used for what would become Buchanan Bus Station in 1976, and the new &quot;civic centre&quot; would move to what would become the ultimate site of the Concert Hall. A multi-story car park was erected on the site of the former railway station building that same year. Even as far back as the late 1960s, Leslie Martin&#x27;s initial concepts showed familiar aspects of the building that would be recognised today – the extensive use of colonnades (which would only be ultimately used on the north entrance of the building), and the cylindrical shaped entrance on its south facing side, which would be centred on the former intersection of Sauchiehall Street and Parliamentary Road. By the mid 1970s, the first ideas that the eastern edge of the site would be devoted to shops began to appear, but it was not until the 1980s that this began to develop into plans for the giant shopping mall that was eventually built. In 1988, the retailer John Lewis &amp; Partners had signed up as the anchor tenant of the proposed development The &quot;Buchanan Centre&quot; as it was initially called – would adjoin onto the side of the concert hall and John Lewis would occupy half of the mall&#x27;s planned area, although it would be 1999 before it was finally realised – as the &quot;Buchanan Galleries&quot;.

The Edinburgh-based company RMJM and partners were appointed as project architects for the Royal Concert Hall in 1988. Councillor Pat Lally symbolically drove in the first concrete pile of the building in the April of that year.

==Performance spaces and facilities==
The Main Auditorium is the largest performance space in the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, and can seat 2475 people. Other spaces in the hall include the 500 capacity Strathclyde Suite, the 300 capacity Exhibition Hall, the 120 capacity Buchanan Suite, the 300 capacity Lomond and Clyde foyers, the 100 capacity Strathclyde Bar, 150 capacity City of Music Studio and the 40 capacity VIP Room. The hall also has a gift shop, five bars and café. It also houses the headquarters of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra.

The Green Room, formerly a fine-dining room, was restyled in 2009 and renamed &quot;The City of Music Studio&quot; to celebrate Glasgow&#x27;s UNESCO City of Music status. The City of Music Studio is known for the view overlooking Buchanan Street and its late night jazz programme. The Cafe Bar was re-branded and refurbished in 2011 as Café Encore following Encore&#x27;s takeover of the catering department.

The Royal Scottish National Orchestra recently moved to a purpose-built new home on-site, entered from Killermont Street. At the heart of their new home is an acoustically adjustable, 600-seat auditorium, providing also world-class rehearsal and recording facilities for the Orchestra. The Royal Scottish National Orchestra Centre also houses a dedicated education space, the Robertson Learning and Engagement Centre.

A bespoke four manual Copeman Hart digital organ and associated speakers was permanently installed in the Hall in July 2015.

==Notable events==
The Hall is the Glasgow performance base of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and has hosted many international orchestras, soloists and conductors, including the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, the National Youth Orchestras of Britain and Scotland, the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, Celia Bartoli, Julian Lloyd Webber and Maxim Vengerov.

As well as classical music, the hall plays host to opera and ballet, musical theatre, talks, rock and pop, folk, world and country, swing and comedy. It also exhibits art and photographic exhibitions, and is the venue for graduation ceremonies for the adjacent Glasgow Caledonian University.

On Sunday 9 October 1993, Nelson Mandela chose Glasgow as the place to formally receive the first of his freedoms of nine British cities. He entered the Hall to a choral rendition of &quot;Down by the Riverside&quot; and received a standing ovation. In 1994 Bob Hope took to the stage to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings.

The Hall is the main venue for the annual Celtic Connections Festival, and is one of the venues for the city&#x27;s Aye Write Book Festival.

<text>The Hackensack River is a river, abouty 45 miles (72 km) long, in the U.S. states of New York and New Jersey, emptying into Newark Bay, a back chamber of New York Harbor. The watershed of the river includes part of the suburban area outside New York City just west of the lower Hudson River, which it roughly parallels, separated from it by the New Jersey Palisades. It also flows through and drains the New Jersey Meadowlands. The lower river, which is navigable as far as the city of Hackensack, is heavily industrialized and forms a commercial extension of Newark Bay.

Once believed to be among the most polluted watercourses in the United States, it staged a modest revival by the late 2000s. The river is divided into the upper river, north of the Oradell Reservoir and Oradell Dam, and lower river, south of the reservoir and dam.

==Description==
The Hackensack River rises in southeastern New York, in Rockland County, in the Sweet Swamp, located in the hamlet of New City just west of the Hudson River and half a mile south of High Tor State Park. It flows briefly southeast, into the Lake DeForest reservoir, separated from the Hudson by less than 3 mi (5 km). South of the dam, it then flows south, diverging from the Hudson. Just across the New Jersey state line, in northern Bergen County, it is impounded to form the reservoir Lake Tappan near River Vale.

South of Lake Tappan, it flows in a meandering course southward through the suburban communities of New Jersey. Near Oradell, it is impounded to form Oradell Reservoir, where it is surrounded primarily by Oradell, Haworth, and Emerson, and joined by several streams, including the Dwars Kill, the Cherry Brook, and Pascack Brook. Van Buskirk Island, a man-made island and site of the New Milford Plant of the Hackensack Water Company, lies in this area. South of the reservoir, it flows through the Oradell Dam through River Edge, Hackensack, Teaneck, Bogota, and Ridgefield Park, once again approaching within 3 mi (5 km) of the Hudson, and separated from it by the ridge of the Palisades.

At Little Ferry, it is joined by the broad Overpeck Creek, then flows southward, widening in a broad, meandering tidal estuary through the Meadowlands, forming extensive side streams and wetlands. South of North Bergen, it forms the boundary between Bergen County to the west and Hudson County to the east. Opposite Secaucus it is joined by Berry&#x27;s Creek, then flows past the western edge of Jersey City, which overlooks the river&#x27;s valley from the ridge of the Palisades, before forming Newark Bay at its confluence with the Passaic River between Jersey City and Kearny.

As it flows through the Meadowlands it is traversed by numerous rail and road bridges.

==History==
The name of the Hackensack River comes from the Lenape word &quot;Achinigeu-hach&quot;, or &quot;Ackingsah-sack&quot;, meaning &quot;flat confluence of streams&quot; or &quot;stony ground&quot;. Conflicts with the Lenape prevented the early Dutch settlers of the New Netherland colony from expanding westward into the valley into late in the 17th century. The river furnished both the Native Americans and the European settlers with abundant runs of herring, shad, and striped bass.

At the outset of the colonial era, the river&#x27;s watershed was home to Lenape groups now known as the Rumachenanck (or Haverstraw), Tappan, and Hackensack, the latter exonym taken from an encampment near the confluence of the tributary Overpeck Creek. European settlement began in the mid-17th century as part of New Netherland, when the region was called &quot;Achter Kol&quot;, meaning &quot;rear pass&quot; or &quot;behind the ridge&quot;, to describe the valleys west of the Hudson Palisades, which afforded passage to trapping grounds in the northern hinterlands.

The river and the surrounding meadowlands presented a formidable difficulty in transportation and communication. The wetlands helped allow the escape of the Continental Army under George Washington in 1776 after several defeats at the hands of the British army on the east side of the Hudson. It later served as a protective barrier that allowed Washington&#x27;s army to encamp in the nearby hills near Morristown.

== Urbanization and pollution ==

Human alterations to land in the Hackensack meadowlands increased in the 19th century, including clearing forests, building roads, railroads, and ditches, and filling wetlands. The Second Industrial Revolution led to construction of heavy manufacturing, storage tanks, and chemical-processing plants in the area during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The economic development and population increases in the watershed led to extensive water pollution in the river, both from municipal sewage and industrial wastewater. In the 20th century, untreated sewage discharges from the various towns and cities began to contribute significant amounts of pollutants to the river. The first sewage plant with secondary treatment technology (which removes at least 85% of pollutants) did not open until the 1950s, and more treatment capacity was added in the region in the following decades. Water-quality studies in the late 1980s indicated that the river continued to be impaired with low oxygen levels and nutrient pollution. In the 21st century, many communities in the watershed continue to be drained by combined sewers, which discharge untreated sewage during large rainstorms.

Development of new drinking-water supplies also had major environmental impacts on the river. The construction of the Oradell Reservoir dam in 1921 essentially changed the lower river from a free-flowing stream into a brackish estuary, allowing the encroachment of marine species. Urbanization in the region intensified after World War II, with the expansion of roads and highways, including the New Jersey Turnpike (1952), as well as the Meadowlands Sports Complex (1970s).

By the 1960s, much of the lower river was essentially a turbid, hypoxic dead zone, with only the hardiest of species, such as the mummichog, able to survive in its waters. Chemical companies dumped large volumes of waste into Berry&#x27;s Creek during the 20th century, resulting in the highest concentrations of methyl mercury of any freshwater sediment in the world, as well as extensive residues of polychlorinated biphenyls and other chemicals. Three sites along the creek are federally designated as Superfund sites and require major cleanup operations, which are ongoing as of 2022.

The river recovered somewhat by the late 2000s, following the decline in manufacturing in the area, as well as from enforcement of Clean Water Act regulations and from the efforts of local conservancy groups. Recreational fishing has staged a modest comeback, although catch and release may be advisable, as health advisories against the consumption of fish caught in the river are continuing. Urban runoff pollution, municipal sewage discharges from sanitary sewer overflows and combined sewer overflows, and runoff from hazardous-waste sites continue to impair the river&#x27;s water quality.

The future of the wetlands around the lower river has been an ongoing controversy between development and preservation groups in recent decades. The Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission, later called the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission, was established by the state in 1968 to manage development and habitat preservation. The commission was merged into the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority in 2015.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed designating the Lower Hackensack as a Superfund site, which would make it eligible for environmental remediation partially funded by original polluters. In September 2022, the Lower Hackensack was declared a federal Superfund site, triggering the process.

<text>Abigail Pierrepont Johnson (born December 19, 1961) is an American billionaire businesswoman and the granddaughter of late Edward C. Johnson II, the founder of Fidelity Investments. Since 2014, Johnson has been president and chief executive officer (CEO) of American investment firm Fidelity Investments (FMR), and chair of its former sister company Fidelity International (FIL). Her father, Edward C. &quot;Ned&quot; Johnson III, remained chair emeritus of FMR until his death in March 2022. As of March 2013, the Johnson family owned a 49% stake in the privately-held company, with Johnson herself holding an estimated 24.5%. She is a board member of Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

In November 2016, Johnson was named chair and remained CEO and president, giving her full control of Fidelity with 45,000 employees worldwide. As of June 2024 Johnson&#x27;s wealth is approximately $35.6 billion, making her one of the world&#x27;s wealthiest women. She was named on Forbes&#x27; &quot;The Richest Person In America&#x27;s 50 Largest Cities&quot; list in 2016, and as of 2024, has been ranking among the top ten most powerful women of the world continuously since 2017 on their &quot;World&#x27;s 100 Most Powerful Women&quot; list. She has been the richest person in Massachusetts since at least 2015.

== Early life ==
She was born in Boston, Massachusetts on December 19, 1961. Johnson and her younger siblings did not feel pressured to join the family business. As a child Johnson was attracted to her father’s work. 
Johnson attended Cambridge, Massachusetts private school Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols School and then graduated from William Smith College with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in art history in 1984. After working as a consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton, where she met her husband, Johnson completed an MBA at Harvard Business School.

== Fidelity Investments ==

Upon graduating from Harvard Business School in 1988, Johnson joined Fidelity Investments, which her grandfather Edward Johnson II founded in 1946 and of which her father Edward Johnson III was then the CEO. She began as an analyst and portfolio manager. In 2001, she was promoted to president of Fidelity Asset Management. During her time in that position, Johnson unsuccessfully attempted to orchestrate a vote to remove her father as CEO over disagreements about his business decisions. In 2005, she became Head of Retail, Workplace, and Institutional Business. She was named president in 2012. In 2014, she became CEO, and in 2016 she became chairman as well. In 2018, Johnson introduced cryptocurrency investment at Fidelity, making it possible for institutional investors to trade Bitcoin and Ether.

==Politics==
In 2015, Johnson donated $2,700, the maximum amount legally allowed for presidential primary campaigns, to Republican candidate Jeb Bush. In 2016, she donated about $330,000 to Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

== Awards and honors == 
Johnson has served as a member of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation and as a member of the board of directors of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) and of MIT. She is the first and only woman to serve on the board of the Financial Services Forum.

Forbes has ranked Johnson among the most powerful women in the world for several years:

Johnson was ranked 13th on Fortune&#x27;s list of Most Powerful Women in 2023. In 2024, American Banker recognized Johnson as the No. 2 Most Powerful Woman in Finance.

<doc id="610182" wikidata="Q536528" url="?curid=610182" title="Richard Montague">
<text>Richard Merritt Montague (September 20, 1930 – March 7, 1971) was an American mathematician and philosopher who made contributions to mathematical logic and the philosophy of language. He is known for proposing Montague grammar to formalize the semantics of natural language. As a student of Alfred Tarski, he also contributed early developments to axiomatic set theory (ZFC). For the latter half of his life, he was a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles until his early death, believed to be a homicide, at age 40.

==Career==
At the University of California, Berkeley, Montague earned a BA in philosophy in 1950, an MA in mathematics in 1953, and a PhD in Philosophy in 1957, the latter under the direction of the mathematician and logician Alfred Tarski. Montague spent his entire career teaching in the UCLA Department of Philosophy, where he supervised the dissertations of Nino Cocchiarella and Hans Kamp.

Montague wrote on the foundations of logic and set theory, as would befit a student of Tarski. His PhD dissertation, titled &quot;Contributions to the Axiomatic Foundations of Set Theory&quot;, contained the first proof that all possible axiomatizations of the standard axiomatic set theory ZFC must contain infinitely many axioms. In other words, ZFC cannot be finitely axiomatized.

He pioneered a logical approach to natural language semantics that became known as Montague grammar. This approach to language has been especially influential among certain computational linguists—perhaps more so than among more traditional philosophers of language. In particular, Montague&#x27;s influence lives on in grammar approaches like categorial grammar (such as Unification Categorial Grammar, Left-Associative Grammar, or Combinatory Categorial Grammar), which attempt a derivation of syntactic and semantic representation in tandem and the semantics of quantifiers, scope and discourse (Hans Kamp, a student of Montague&#x27;s, co-developed Discourse Representation Theory).

Montague was an accomplished organist and a successful real estate investor. He died violently in his own home; the crime is unsolved to this day. Anita Feferman and Solomon Feferman argue that he usually went to bars &quot;cruising&quot; and bringing people home with him. On the day that he was murdered, he brought home several people &quot;for some kind of soirée&quot;, but they strangled him.

==In popular culture==
Three novels have been inspired by the life and death of Richard M. Montague:

*&quot;The Mad Man&quot; by American science fiction author Samuel R. Delany (1994)
* &quot;Less Than Meets the Eye&quot; by American philosopher David Berlinski (1994)
* &quot;The Semantics of Murder&quot; by Irish writer Aifric Campbell (2008)

<text>Eric Steven Lander (born February 3, 1957) is an American mathematician and geneticist who is a professor of biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and a professor of systems biology at Harvard Medical School. Eric Lander is founding director emeritus of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

Lander served as the 11th director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and Science Advisor to the President in Joe Biden&#x27;s presidential Cabinet. In response to allegations that he had engaged in bullying and abusive conduct, Lander apologized and resigned from the Biden Administration effective February 18, 2022.

==Early life and education==
Lander was born in Brooklyn, New York City, to Jewish parents, the son of Rhoda G. Lander, a social studies teacher, and Harold Lander, an attorney. He was captain of the math team at Stuyvesant High School, graduating in 1974 as valedictorian and an International Mathematical Olympiad Silver Medalist for the U.S. At age 17, he wrote a paper on quasiperfect numbers, for which he won the Westinghouse Science Talent Search.

After graduating from Stuyvesant High School as valedictorian in 1974, Lander graduated from Princeton University in 1978 as valedictorian and with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics. He completed his senior thesis, &quot;On the structure of projective modules&quot;, under John Coleman Moore&#x27;s supervision. He then moved to the University of Oxford where he was a Rhodes Scholar and student of Wolfson College, Oxford. He was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree by the University of Oxford in 1980 with a thesis on algebraic coding theory and symmetric block designs supervised by Peter Cameron.

==Career==
During his career, Lander has worked on human genetic variation, human population history, genome evolution, non-coding RNAs, three-dimensional folding of the human genome and genome-wide association studies to discover the genes essential for biological processes using CRISPR-based editing.

===Early mathematical career===
As a mathematician, Lander studied combinatorics and applications of representation theory to coding theory. He enjoyed mathematics but did not wish to spend his life in such a &quot;monastic&quot; career. Unsure what to do next, he took a job teaching managerial economics at Harvard Business School. At the suggestion of his brother, developmental biologist Arthur Lander, he started to look at neurobiology, saying at the time, &quot;because there&#x27;s a lot of information in the brain&quot;. To understand mathematical neurobiology, he felt he had to study cellular neurobiology; this, in turn, led to studying microbiology and eventually genetics. &quot;When I finally feel I have learned genetics, I should get back to these other problems. But I&#x27;m still trying to get the genetics right&quot;, Lander said.

Lander later became acquainted with David Botstein, a geneticist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Botstein was working on a way to unravel how subtle differences in complex genetic systems can become disorders such as cancer, diabetes, schizophrenia, and even obesity. The two collaborated to develop a computer algorithm to analyze the maps of genes. In 1986 Lander joined the Whitehead Institute and became an assistant professor at MIT. He was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 1987. In 1990, he founded the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research (WICGR). The WICGR became one of the world&#x27;s leading centers of genome research, and under Lander&#x27;s leadership made great progress in developing new methods of analyzing mammalian genomes. It also made important breakthroughs in applying this information to the study of human genetic variation and formed the basis for the foundation of the Broad Institute—a transformation Lander spearheaded.

===Human Genome Project===
Two main groups attempted to sequence the human genome. The first was the Human Genome Project, a loosely organized, publicly funded effort that intended to publish the information it obtained freely and without restrictions. Many research groups from countries all over the world were involved in this effort. The second was undertaken by Celera Genomics, which intended to patent the information obtained and charge subscriptions for use of the sequence data. Established first, the Human Genome Project moved slowly in the early phases as the Department of Energy&#x27;s role was unclear and sequencing technology was in its infancy. Officially, the Human Genome Project had an eight-year head start before Celera entered the race, though discussions for the Human Genome Project began fourteen years before Celera announced their own project. Because the Human Genome Project was a $3 billion publicly funded venture, the consortia raced to enter as much of the human genome into the public domain as quickly as possible once Celera began work in 1998. This was a change of strategy for the Human Genome Project, because many scientists at the time wanted to establish a more complete copy of the genome, not simply publish the many fragments individually. Lander aggressively pressured Human Genome Project scientists to work longer and faster to publish genome fragments before Celera. Lander himself is now listed on 73 patents and patent applications related to genomics.

In February 2001, both the Human Genome Project and Celera published drafts of the human genome in the scientific journals &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Science&quot;, respectively. In the Human Genome Project&#x27;s &quot;Nature&quot; publication, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Center for Genome Research, was listed first, with Lander listed as the first named author.

Leveraging Celera&#x27;s sequencing and analysis techniques, the Whitehead Institute also made a contribution to the sequencing of the mouse genome, an important step in fully understanding the molecular biology of mice, which are often used as model organisms in studies of everything from human diseases to embryonic development. The WICGR has since sequenced the genomes of &quot;Ciona savignyi&quot; (sea squirt), the pufferfish, the filamentous fungus &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot;, and multiple relatives of &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, one of the most studied yeasts. The &quot;Ciona savignyi&quot; genome provides a good system for exploring the evolutionary origins of all vertebrates. Pufferfish have smaller-sized genomes than other vertebrates; as a result, their genomes are &quot;mini&quot; models for vertebrates. The sequencing of the yeasts related to &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; will facilitate the identification of key gene regulatory elements, some of which may be common to all eukaryotes (including both plant and animal kingdoms).

Lander was the founding editor of the &quot;Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics&quot;. He remained editor till 2004.

===After Human Genome Project===
Lander is the founding director of the Broad Institute, a collaboration between MIT, Harvard, the Whitehead Institute, and affiliated hospitals. Its goal is &quot;to bring the power of genomics to bear on the understanding of disease and to accelerate the search for cures.&quot; In particular, Lander has discovered scientific facts in cell biology and molecular biology of cancer, as well as push precision medicine approaches. He is often credited as among the drivers for the Broad Institute&#x27;s meteoric rise during the 16 years he was a director.

During the Obama presidency, Lander cochaired the Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.

=== Toast to James Watson ===
Lander toasted to James Watson in 2018 for his 90th birthday, which caused controversy in the wake of Watson&#x27;s widely criticized comments around intelligence and race. Lander had included a brief aside in his toast stating that Watson was flawed, but still later apologized for his toast after significant outrage from academics on Twitter. STAT News noted that other scientists had also similarly toasted Watson, but had not elicited similar outrage.

=== CRISPR-Cas 9 Controversy ===
Lander received criticism in the past for allegedly diminishing the accomplishments of Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier after publishing &quot;The Heroes of CRISPR&quot; in Cell. Some argued that his article was misogynistic for having removed women scientists from history. Of particular note, Lander was accused of a conflict of interest, as the Broad Institute had been competing with UC Berkeley for patent rights to commercialize CRISPR. Lander responded by suggesting he had not meant &quot;to diminish anybody&quot; and noted that science is collaborative by nature. Criticism was particularly harsh online by other academics and biologists, due to previous resentment with Lander. During questioning for his role of Science Advisor to the President, Lander admitted that he had made a mistake in understating the accomplishments of Doudna and Charpentier.

===Forensic science and criminal justice===

In 1989, Lander provided expert testimony in the New York criminal case &quot;People v. Castro&quot;. He showed that the then-current method of interpreting DNA evidence was liable to give false positive matches, implicating innocent defendants. Two of the defense attorneys in that case, Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck, went on to found the Innocence Project, an organization that uses DNA analysis to exonerate wrongly convicted prisoners. Lander is a member of the Innocence Project&#x27;s board of directors.

===Science Advisor to the President===
In 2009, Lander was appointed by President Obama as co-chair of the President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), serving for the entire term (2009 to 2017).

In January 2021, President-elect Joe Biden nominated Lander as Science Advisor to the President and announced that he would elevate the position to a Cabinet-level post. In January 2021, the organization &quot;500 Women Scientists&quot; published an editorial in &quot;Scientific American&quot; to consider naming someone else to the position, because he was well known within the scientific community for offending women.
His nomination had been held up possibly due to requests for clarification about his having attended two gatherings where Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy large-scale donor to science who was also a convicted sex offender, was present. He was also questioned about accusations of sexism and his toast to James Watson. On April 29, a confirmation hearing was held in the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. On May 20, the committee voted to report favorably on the nomination, with five Republican senators voting against. On May 28, 2021, before a Memorial Day recess, his nomination was confirmed by voice vote by the full Senate. Lander was sworn in as director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) on June 2, 2021. He took his oath using a rare 1492 copy of the Pirkei Avot.

On February 7, 2022, &quot;Politico&quot; reported on a White House investigation in which fourteen current and former Office of Science and Technology Policy staffers accused Lander on February 4 of having bullied and demeaned his subordinates. Lander issued an apology to staff on February 4, his apology includes, &quot;I am devastated that I caused hurt to past and present colleagues by the way in which I have spoken to them... I believe it is not possible to continue effectively in my role, and the work of this office is far too important to be hindered.&quot; He later resigned on February 7. In the following month, &quot;Politico&quot; published an analysis of Lander&#x27;s connections with Eric Schmidt. &quot;Politico&quot; documented the appearance of conflicts of interest related to Schmidt&#x27;s financial support for many of the employees of the OSTP.

=== After resignation ===
Since 2023, Eric Lander has returned to his tenured professor positions at MIT and Harvard as well as the Broad Institute as a Core Institute Member and Founding Director Emeritus. While some opinion pieces argued that &quot;Eric Lander is getting uncanceled&quot;, The Chronicles of Higher Education noted that some staffers at the Broad expressed alarm at Lander&#x27;s sudden return without further discussion from their leadership. In 2023, Lander started a non-profit called &quot;Science for America&quot; focused on &quot;moonshot&quot; ideas such as nuclear fusion or cancer research.

===Recognition and service===
In 1999, Lander received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2004, Lander was named one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 most influential people of our time for his work on the Human Genome Project. He has appeared in numerous PBS documentaries about genetics. He was ranked #2 on the MIT150 list of MIT&#x27;s innovators and ideas.

In December 2008, Lander and Harold E. Varmus were named co-chairs of the Obama administration&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. In 2012 he received the Dan David Prize.

Lander is a member of the advisory board to the USA Science and Engineering Festival.

In 2013, Lander was awarded the first Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences. In 2016, Semantic Scholar AI program ranked him #1 on its list of most influential biomedical researchers.

In 2016, he received the Award for Excellence in Molecular Diagnostics from the Association for Molecular Pathology.

In 2017, Lander received an &quot;honoris causa&quot; doctorate from the Université catholique de Louvain. Also in 2017, he received the William Allan Award from the American Society of Human Genetics.

In 2019, he served on the Life Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize. In 2020, Pope Francis appointed him a member of the Pontifical Academy of Science. In 2021, Lander, who holds many patents, disclosed ownership of assets worth more than $45 million.

<text>Hypericaceae is a plant family in the order Malpighiales, comprising six to nine genera and up to 700 species, and commonly known as the St. John&#x27;s wort family. Members are found throughout the world apart from extremely cold or dry habitats. &quot;Hypericum&quot; and &quot;Triadenum&quot; occur in temperate regions but other genera are mostly tropical.

==Characteristics==
Members of this family are annual or perennial herbs, subshrubs or shrubs. The leaves are simple and entire, in opposite pairs; they are sometimes dotted with black or translucent glandular spots. The inflorescence consists of a branched, flat-topped cluster, each flower being radially symmetrical, with a superior ovary. Flowers have the following components: sepals, four or five, which tend to persist; petals four or five, usually yellow, sometimes dotted with black specks; stamens many, on long filaments; styles, three to five, often fused at the base. The fruit has a dehiscent capsule which splits open when ripe to release the fine black seed.

==Taxonomy==
At one time, this family was accepted as a subfamily of the family Clusiaceae. Now it has been elevated to full family status. In &quot;Phytotaxa&quot;, six genera and around 590 species are listed, whereas &quot;The Plant List&quot; recognises nine genera and around 700 species. Members of the family are found worldwide except in excessively cold or dry areas. Most of the genera are mainly tropical, but &quot;Hypericum&quot; and &quot;Triadenum&quot; are found in temperate regions. Molecular data supports the monophyly of Hypericaceae.

When accepted as a complete family, the cladogram of Hypericaceae would appear as such:
==Pharmacology==

Many members of this family contain the naphthodianthrone derivatives hypericin and pseudohypericin; these are contained in glandular tissues that appear as black, orange or translucent spots or lines on petals, leaves and other parts of the plant. These compounds are photosensitive and can cause reactions in grazing animals, such as blistering of the muzzle, as well as in people who come into contact with the plants over prolonged periods. The highest concentration of these substances occurs in common St. John&#x27;s wort (&quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot;), which is used in herbalism and as a folk remedy.

<doc id="610188" wikidata="Q414242" url="?curid=610188" title="Cathinone">
<text>Cathinone (; also known as β-ketoamphetamine) is a monoamine alkaloid found in the shrub &quot;Catha edulis&quot; (khat) and is chemically similar to ephedrine, cathine, methcathinone and other amphetamines. It is probably the main contributor to the stimulant effect of &quot;Catha edulis&quot;, also known as khat. Cathinone differs from many other amphetamines in that it has a ketone functional group. Other phenethylamines that share this structure include the stimulants methcathinone, MDPV, mephedrone and the antidepressant bupropion.

==History==
===Discovery===
Khat has been cultivated in the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula region of the world for thousands of years. It is most commonly chewed for the euphoric effect it produces. The active ingredient was first proposed in 1930, when cathine was identified as a predominant alkaloid in the plant. Cathine was thought to be the main active ingredient in khat until the 1960s, when it was found that the amount of cathine in the khat leaves is insufficient to produce the effects observed. In 1975, the United Nations Narcotic Laboratory analyzed khat leaves from Yemen, Kenya and Madagascar and found evidence of a different alkaloid, cathinone. Cathinone is molecularly similar to cathine, but is much more abundant in younger plants. This finding caused scientists to speculate that cathinone was the true active ingredient in khat.

A study was conducted in 1994 to test the effects of cathinone. Six volunteers who had never chewed khat were given an active khat sample and a cathinone-free placebo sample. The researchers analyzed the participants&#x27; moods, activity levels and blood pressure before and after consuming the khat or placebo. This analysis showed that cathinone produced amphetamine-like symptoms, leading the researchers to confirm that cathinone, not cathine, is the active ingredient in khat leaves.

===Cultural significance===

Over 20 million people in the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa chew khat leaves daily. It is an important piece of the culture and economy in this region, especially in Ethiopia (where khat is said to have originated), Kenya, Djibouti, Somalia and Yemen. Men usually chew it during parties or other social gatherings while smoking cigarettes and drinking tea. Farmers and other workers also use khat in the afternoon to reduce fatigue and hunger as the day goes on. It functions like the caffeine in a strong cup of coffee as an anti-fatigue drug. Students and drivers have been known to use it to stay alert for longer periods of time.

In order to produce its desired effects, khat leaves should be chewed fresh. The fresh leaves have a higher concentration of cathinone. Waiting too long after cultivation to chew the leaf will allow the cathinone to break down into its less potent form, cathine. Because of the need for quick chewing, it is a habit that has historically been prevalent only where the plant grows. However, in the recent years with improvements in road and air transport, khat chewing has spread to all corners of the world.

The cultivation of khat in Yemen is a highly profitable industry for farmers. Khat plants will grow differently depending on the climate they are grown in and each one will produce different amounts of cathinone. It generally grows best in coastal, hot climates. In Yemen, the khat plant is named after the region in which it is grown. The Nehmi khat plant has the highest known concentration of cathinone, 342.5 mg/100 g.

===Legality===
Internationally, cathinone is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Circa 1993, the DEA added cathinone to the Controlled Substances Act&#x27;s Schedule I.

The sale of khat is legal in some jurisdictions, but illegal in others (see Khat (Regulation)). Substituted cathinones were also often used as the key ingredient of recreational drug mixes commonly known as &quot;bath salts&quot; in the United States.

The table below shows the legality of khat and cathinone in various countries:
==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Cathinone has been found to stimulate the release of dopamine and inhibit the reuptake of epinephrine, norepinephrine and serotonin in the central nervous system (CNS). These neurotransmitters are all considered monoamines and share the general structure of an aromatic ring and an amine group attached by a two-carbon separator. Because cathinone is a hydrophobic molecule, it can easily cross cell membranes and other barriers, including the blood–brain barrier. This property allows it to interact with the monoamine transporters in the synaptic cleft between neurons. Cathinone induces the release of dopamine from brain striatal preparations that are prelabelled either with dopamine or its precursors. It is more specificllay a norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (NDRA) similarly to amphetamine.

The metabolites of cathinone, cathine and norephedrine, also possess CNS stimulation, but create much weaker effects. The effects of cathinone on the body can be countered by a preceding administration of a dopamine receptor antagonist. The antagonist prevents synaptic dopamine released by cathinone from exerting its effect by binding to dopamine receptors.

Cathinone can also affect cholinergic concentrations in the gut and airways by blocking prejunctional adrenergic receptors (α2 adrenergic) and activating 5-HT7 receptors, thereby inhibiting smooth muscle contraction. It can also induce dry mouth, blurred vision and increased blood pressure and heart rate.

Cathinone is a weak agonist of the mouse, rat, and human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). In contrast to cathinone however, most other cathinones are not human TAAR1 agonists. TAAR1 activation may auto-inhibit and constrain the monoaminergic effects of monoamine releasing agents possessing TAAR1 agonism.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Khat leaves are removed from the plant stalk and are kept in a ball in the cheek and chewed. Chewing releases juices from the leaves, which include the alkaloid cathinone. The absorption of cathinone has two phases: one in the buccal mucosa and one in the stomach and small intestine. The stomach and small intestine are very important in the absorption of ingested alkaloids. At approximately 2.3 hours after chewing khat leaves, the maximum concentration of cathinone in blood plasma is reached. The mean residence time is 5.2 ± 3.4 hours. The elimination half-life of cathinone is 1.5 ± 0.8 hours. A two-compartment model for absorption and elimination best describes this data. However, at most, only 7% of the ingested cathinone is recovered in the urine. This indicates that the cathinone is being broken down in the body. Cathinone has been shown to selectively metabolize into R,S-(-)-norephedrine and cathine. The reduction of the ketone group in cathinone will produce cathine. This reduction is catalyzed by enzymes in the liver. The spontaneous breakdown of cathinone is the reason it must be chewed fresh after cultivation.

===Effects on health===
The first documentation of the khat plant being used in medicine was in a book published by an Arabian physician in the 10th century. It was used as an antidepressant because it led to feelings of happiness and excitement. Chronic khat chewing can also create drug dependence, as shown by animal studies. In such studies, monkeys were trained to push a lever to receive the drug reward. As the monkeys&#x27; dependence increased, they pressed the lever at an increasing frequency.

Khat chewing and the effects of cathinone on the body differ from person to person, but there is a general pattern of behavior that emerges after ingesting fresh cathinone:

# Feelings of euphoria that last for one to two hours
# Discussion of serious issues and increased irritability
# Very active imagination
# Depression
# Irritability, loss of appetite and insomnia

There are other effects not related to the CNS. The chewer can develop constipation and heartburn after a khat session. Long-term effects of cathinone can include gum disease or oral cancer, cardiovascular disease and depression. The withdrawal symptoms of cathinone include hot flashes, lethargy and a great urge to use the drug for at least the first two days.

==Chemistry==

===Biosynthesis===
The synthesis of cathinone in khat begins with L-phenylalanine and the first step is carried out by L-phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), which cleaves off an ammonia group and creates a carbon-carbon double bond, forming cinnamic acid. After this, the molecule can either go through a beta-oxidative pathway or a non-beta-oxidative pathway. The beta-oxidative pathway produces benzoyl-CoA while the non-beta-oxidative pathway produces benzoic acid. Both of these molecules can be converted to 1-phenylpropane-1,2-dione by a condensation reaction catalyzed by a ThDP-dependent enzyme (Thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme) with pyruvate and producing CO2. 1-phenylpropane-1,2-dione goes through a transaminase reaction to replace a ketone with an ammonia group to form (S)-cathinone. (S)-Cathinone can then undergo a reduction reaction to produce the less potent but structurally similar cathine or norephedrine, which are also found in the plant.

Aside from the beta- and non-beta-oxidative pathways, the biosynthesis of cathinone can proceed through a CoA-dependent pathway. The CoA-dependent pathway is actually a mix between the two main pathways as it starts like the beta-oxidative pathway and then when it loses CoA, it finishes the synthesis in the non-beta-oxidative pathway. In this pathway, the trans-cinnamic acid produced from L-phenylalanine is ligated to a Coenzyme A (CoA), just like the beginning of the beta-oxidative pathway. It then undergoes hydration at the double bond. This product then loses the CoA to produce benzaldehyde, an intermediate of the non-beta-oxidative pathway. Benzaldehyde is converted into benzoic acid and proceeds through the rest of the synthesis.

===Synthetic production===
Cathinone can be synthetically produced from propiophenone through a Friedel-Crafts acylation of propionic acid and benzene. The resulting propiophenone can be brominated, and the bromine can be substituted with ammonia to produce a racemic mixture of cathinone. A different synthetic strategy must be employed to produce enantiomerically pure (S)-cathinone. This synthetic route starts out with the N-acetylation of the optically active amino acid, S-alanine. Then, phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) is used to chlorinate the carboxylic acid forming an acyl chloride. At the same time, a Friedel-Crafts acylation is preformed on benzene with aluminum chloride catalyst. Finally, the acetyl protecting group is removed by heating with hydrochloric acid to form enantiomerically pure S-(-)-cathinone.

=== Structure ===
Cathinone can be extracted from &quot;Catha edulis&quot; (khat), or synthesized from &quot;α&quot;-bromopropiophenone (which is easily made from propiophenone). Because cathinone is both a primary amine and a ketone, it is very prone to dimerization, especially as a free base isolated from plant matter. These dimers are pharmacologically inactive, and the rapid dimerization reduces active amounts of cathinone in non-fresh khat. The rapid formation of dimers also applies to other non-&quot;N&quot;-substituted cathinones such as methylenedioxycathinone (MDC; normethylone).

The structure of cathinone is very similar to that of other molecules. By reducing the ketone, it becomes cathine if it retains its stereochemistry, or norephedrine if its stereochemistry is inverted. Cathine is a less potent version of cathinone and cathinone&#x27;s spontaneous reduction is the reason that older khat plants are not as stimulating as younger ones. Cathinone and amphetamine are closely related in that amphetamine is only lacking the ketone C=O group. Cathinone is structurally related to methcathinone, in much the same way as amphetamine is related to methamphetamine. Cathinone differs from amphetamine by possessing a ketone oxygen atom (C=O) on the &quot;β&quot; (beta) position of the side chain. Advancements in synthesizing cyclic cathinones based on α-tetralone have employed chiral HPLC-CD techniques to determine the absolute configuration of enantiomers, an approach that may contribute to the development of pharmaceutical analogs with antidepressant potential. The corresponding substance cathine, is a less powerful stimulant. The biophysiological conversion from cathinone to cathine is to blame for the depotentiation of khat leaves over time. Fresh leaves have a greater ratio of cathinone to cathine than dried ones, therefore having more psychoactive effects.

There are many cathinone derivatives that include the addition of an R group to the amino end of the molecule. Some of these derivatives have medical uses as well. Bupropion is one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants and its structure is Cathinone with a tertiary butyl group attached to the nitrogen and chlorine attached to the benzene ring meta- to the main carbon chain.

Other cathinone derivatives are strong psychoactive drugs. One such drug is methylone, a drug structurally similar to MDMA.

<text>Big Bird&#x27;s Birthday or Let Me Eat Cake is a 1991 television special based on the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. In the special, Big Bird celebrates his sixth birthday. The special aired on PBS stations during the week of March 9, 1991 as part of the PBS pledge drive season. On March 15, the special was re-aired as the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; episode &quot;2835&quot;, with additional inserts from previous episodes added and the pledge break scene removed.

==Plot==
Snuffy visits Big Bird&#x27;s nest in the morning so he can be the first to wish Big Bird a happy birthday. During the opening credits, the two head out down the street as Big Bird&#x27;s friends wish him a happy birthday, then everyone sings about &quot;Big Bird&#x27;s Beautiful Birthday Bash&quot; in the arbor. The &quot;Monsterpiece Theater&quot; sketch &quot;The King and I&quot; is repeated from a previous episode. Big Bird and his friends will go to the Wollman Rink in Central Park for his skating party, and Maria and Susan will stay behind to decorate. Snuffy also wants to stay behind because he doesn&#x27;t know how to roller skate, so Big Bird will teach him how to skate. Robin Williams shows Elmo the fun things he can do with a stick. Everyone enjoys skating at the rink, but Snuffy is not sure he wants to learn how to skate because he fears falling. Big Bird is finally able to convince Snuffy to learn, until someone falls in front of them. The song &quot;We Are All Earthlings&quot; follows. Maria and Susan lay out Big Bird&#x27;s cake, then go to their apartments to find more chairs. Cookie Monster finds Big Bird&#x27;s cake and realizes he can&#x27;t eat it, so he finds other things to eat, starting with the chairs and the table. Grover sings &quot;Monster in the Mirror&quot; along with several celebrities. Monster on the Spot reporter Telly Monster asks if The Count will support his public television station. The Count recites a long list of reasons why, leading to a pledge break.

Snuffy, still afraid of falling, tries to leave the rink. Telly asks Luis where Oscar the Grouch is. Oscar and Bruno are skating at the party because he loves falling down when skating. Bruno skates around without falling, but the skating made Oscar dizzy. Whoopi Goldberg and Hoots the Owl talk about being proud of their body parts. Big Bird impresses Snuffy with a rollerskating routine, but he can&#x27;t skate like Big Bird. Big Bird and friends sing &quot;Put One Foot in Front of the Other&quot;, which helps Snuffy skate around the rink. Cookie Monster has eaten everything around him, and when Susan and Maria come back, they take the cake away from him. The Oinker Sisters sing &quot;A New Way to Walk&quot;, repeated from a previous episode. Everyone returns to the street and notices that almost everything has been eaten. Big Bird&#x27;s friends give him his cake, sing &quot;Happy Birthday To You&quot;, and then Big Bird blows out all the candles for his birthday wish. The credits begin as the cake is cut, but stop when Maria wonders where Cookie Monster is; he eats his slice of cake, and the sponsors for dessert. The credits continue as everyone skates at the rink.

<doc id="610191" wikidata="Q42688" url="?curid=610191" title="Ragdoll">
<text>The Ragdoll is a breed of cat with a distinct colorpoint coat and blue eyes. Its morphology is large and weighty, and it has a semi-long and silky soft coat. American breeder Ann Baker developed Ragdolls in the 1960s. They are best known for their docile, placid temperament and affectionate nature. The name &quot;Ragdoll&quot; is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up. The breed is particularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the United States. 

Ragdolls are often known as &quot;dog-like cats&quot; or &quot;puppy-like cats&quot;, due to their tendency to follow people around, their receptiveness to handling, and their relative lack of aggression towards other pets.

Ragdolls are distinguishable by their pointed coloration (where the body is lighter than the face, ears, legs, and tail), large round blue eyes, soft, thick coats, thick limbs, long tails, and soft bodies. Their color rings are commonly tricolor or bicolor.

==History==

The breed was developed in Riverside, California, by breeder Ann Baker. In 1963, a regular, non-pedigreed, white domestic longhaired cat named Josephine produced several litters of typical cats. Josephine was not of any particular breed, nor were the males who sired the original litters. Ann Baker herself said that the original cats of the Ragdoll breed were &quot;alley cats&quot;. Josephine later produced kittens with a docile, placid temperament, affectionate nature, and a tendency to go limp and relaxed when picked up.

Out of those early litters came Blackie, an all-black male, and Daddy Warbucks, a seal point with white feet. Daddy Warbucks sired the founding bi-color female Fugianna, and Blackie sired Buckwheat, a dark brown-black Burmese-like female. Both Fugianna and Buckwheat were Josephine&#x27;s daughters. All Ragdolls are descended from Baker&#x27;s cats through matings of Daddy Warbucks to Fugianna and Buckwheat.

Baker, in an unusual move, spurned traditional cat breeding associations. She trademarked the name &quot;Ragdoll&quot;, set up her own registry—the International Ragdoll Cat Association (IRCA)—around 1971, and enforced stringent standards on anyone who wanted to breed or sell cats under that name. The Ragdolls were also not allowed to be registered by other breed associations. The IRCA is still in existence today but is quite small, particularly since Baker&#x27;s death in 1997.

In 1975, a group led by a husband-and-wife team, Denny and Laura Dayton, broke ranks with the IRCA to gain mainstream recognition for the Ragdoll. Beginning with a breeding pair of IRCA cats, this group eventually developed the Ragdoll standard currently accepted by major cat registries such as the CFA and the FIFe. Around the time of the spread of the Ragdoll breed in America during the early 1960s, a breeding pair of Ragdolls was exported to the UK. Eight more cats followed this pair to fully establish the breed in the UK, where the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy recognizes it.

==Breed description==

===Temperament===
The Ragdoll has been known to have a very floppy and calm nature, with claims that these characteristics have been passed down from the Persian and Birman breeds. Opinions vary as to whether this trait might be the result of genetic mutation or merely an instinctive reaction from being picked up as kittens by their mother. The extreme docility of some individuals has led to the myth that Ragdolls are pain resistant. Some breeders in Britain have tried to breed away from the limpness owing to concerns that extreme docility &quot;might not be in the best interests of the cat&quot;.

Breed standard marketing and publicity material describe the Ragdoll as affectionate, intelligent, relaxed in temperament, gentle, and an easy-to-handle lap cat. The animals are often known as &quot;puppy cats&quot;, &quot;dog-like cats&quot;, &quot;cat-dogs&quot;, etc., because of their placid nature and affectionate behavior, with the cats often following owners from room to room as well as seeking physical affection akin to certain dog breeds. Ragdolls can be trained to retrieve toys and enjoy doing so. They have a very playful nature that often lasts well into their senior years. Unlike many other breeds, Ragdolls prefer staying low to the ground rather than the highest point in the household.

===Physical characteristics===
The Ragdoll is one of the largest domesticated cat breeds. Fully-grown females weigh from . Males are substantially larger, ranging from or more. It can take up to four years for a Ragdoll to reach mature size. They have a sturdy body, bulky frame, and proportionate legs. Their heads are broad with a flat top and wide space between the ears. They have long, muscular bodies with broad chests and short necks. Their tails are bushy and long in length, their paws are large, round, and tufted, and their coats are silky, dense, and medium to long length. Due to their coats tending to be long, they usually require brushing at least twice a week. Adults develop knickerbockers on their hind legs and a ruff around their necks.

The breed is often known for its large, round, deep-blue eyes, though other cats may have that feature as well. The genes for point coloration are also responsible for these distinctive blue eyes. Deeper shades of blue are favored in cat shows.

Although the breed has a plush coat, it consists mainly of long guard hairs, while the lack of a dense undercoat results, according to the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association, in &quot;reduced shedding and matting&quot;. There may be a noticeable increase of shedding in the spring.

Ragdolls come in six distinct colors: seal, chocolate, red, and the corresponding dilutes: blue, lilac, and cream. There also are the lynx and tortoiseshell variations in all colors and the three patterns. Ragdoll kittens are born white; they have good color at 8–10 weeks and full color and coat at 3–4 years.

==== Patterns ====

*Colorpoint: one color darkening at the extremities (nose, ears, tail, and paws)
*Mitted: same as pointed but with white paws and abdomen. With or without a blaze (a white line or spot on the face), they must have a &quot;belly stripe&quot; (white stripe that runs from the chin to the genitals) and a white chin. Mitted Ragdolls, which weren&#x27;t allowed titling in CFA until the 2008–2009 show season, are often confused with Birmans. The easiest way to tell the difference is by size (the Ragdoll being larger) and chin color (Mitted Ragdolls have white chins, while Birmans have colored chins), although breeders recognize the two by head shape and boning.
*Bicolor: white legs, white inverted &quot;V&quot; on the face, white abdomen, and sometimes white patches on the back (excessive amounts of white, while it does occur, is against breed standard).

==== Variations ====

*Lynx: a variant of the colorpoint type having tabby markings. This variation always comes with white ear lines, no matter the pattern.
*Tortoiseshell or &quot;tortie:&quot; a variant noted for mottled or parti-colored markings in the above patterns. 

==Health==
A UK study utilizing veterinary records found a life expectancy of 10.31 years compared to 11.74 overall. One study, utilizing Swedish insurance data, showed that of the common cat breeds, the Ragdoll and Siamese have the lowest survival rate, with a 78% chance of survival to 10 years. An English study of patient records found a life expectancy of 10.1 years. In a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis, the Ragdoll was over-represented, with an odds ratio of 5.14. An English study reviewing over 190,000 patient records found the Ragdoll to be less likely to acquire diabetes mellitus than mixed breed cats. The prevalence in Ragdolls was 0.24% compared to 0.58% overall.
===Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy===
The Ragdoll is one of the more commonly affected breeds for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. An autosomal dominant mutation of the MYBPC group of genes is responsible for the condition in the breed.

The allelic frequencies of the mutation R820W were 0.17 in cats from Italy and 0.23 in cats from the US in 2013. This reference states that the R820W prevalence is 30% in the UK. The HCM prevalence was found to be 2.9% (95% CI = 2.7–8.6%) in this study.

<text>Kevin Richard Kregel (born September 16, 1956) is an American former astronaut, and former member of the Space Launch Initiative Project at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center.

==Personal data==
Born on September 16, 1956, Kregel grew up in Amityville, New York. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America, where he achieved its second highest rank, Life Scout. Kregel is currently married to Jeanne F. Kammer of Farmingdale, New York, with whom he has four children. His parents, Alfred H. Kregel Jr., and Frances T. Kregel, are deceased.

==Education==
He graduated from Amityville Memorial High School, Amityville, New York. National Merit Scholar in 1974. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Astronautical Engineering from the United States Air Force Academy in 1978 and received a Master of Science degree in public administration from Troy University in 1988.

==Experience==
Kregel graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1978, and earned his pilot wings in August 1979 at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona. From 1980 to 1983 he was assigned to F-111 aircraft at RAF Lakenheath. While serving as an exchange officer flying A-6E aircraft with the U.S. Navy at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Seattle, and aboard the USS &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;, Kregel made 66 carrier landings during a cruise of the Western Pacific. His next assignment was an exchange tour at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at Patuxent River, Maryland. Upon graduation he was assigned to Eglin AFB, Florida, conducting weapons and electronic systems testing on the F-111, F-15, and the initial weapons certification test of the F-15E aircraft. Kregel resigned from active duty in 1990 in order to work for NASA. He has logged over 5,000 flight hours in 30 different aircraft.

===NASA experience===
In April 1990, Kregel was employed by NASA as an aerospace engineer and instructor pilot. Stationed at Ellington Field, Houston, Texas, his primary responsibilities included flying as an instructor pilot in the Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA) and conducting the initial flight test of the T-38 avionics upgrade aircraft.

Selected by NASA in March 1992, Kregel reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He completed one year of training and is qualified for assignment as a pilot on future Space Shuttle flight crews. Additional duties have included: Astronaut Support Personnel team at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida supporting Space Shuttle launches and landings; CAPCOM in Mission Control. A veteran of four space flights, Kregel has logged 52 days, 17 hours, 20 minutes and 5 seconds in space. He was the pilot on STS-70 (July 13–22, 1995) and STS-78 (June 20 to July 7, 1996), and was the spacecraft commander on STS-87 (November 19 to December 5, 1997) and STS-99 (February 11–22, 2000). Kregel was assigned to the Space Launch Initiative Project, Engineering Directorate, Johnson Space Center, until 2003, when he decided to retire from NASA. He went on to become a pilot for Southwest Airlines until retiring on December 7, 2018.

===Space flight experience===
STS-70 &quot;Discovery&quot; (July 13–22, 1995) was a 9-day mission during which the crew performed a variety of experiments in addition to deploying the sixth and final NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite. The mission was completed in 142 orbits of the Earth, traveling 3.7 million miles in 214 hours, 20 minutes. STS-70 was the first mission controlled from the new combined control center.

STS-78 &quot;Columbia&quot; (June 20 to July 7, 1996) was a 16-day Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission. It included studies sponsored by ten nations and five space agencies, was the first mission to combine both a full microgravity studies agenda and a comprehensive life science investigation, and served as a model for future studies on board the International Space Station. STS-78 orbited the Earth 271 times, covering 7 million miles in 405 hours, 48 minutes.

STS-87 &quot;Columbia&quot; (November 19 to December 5, 1997) was the fourth U.S Microgravity Payload flight and focused on experiments to study how the weightless environment of space affects various physical processes, and observations of the Sun&#x27;s outer atmospheric layers. Two members of the crew performed an EVA (spacewalk) which featured the manual capture of a Spartan satellite and also tested EVA tools and procedures for future Space Station assembly. The mission was accomplished in 252 Earth orbits during which the crew traveled 6.5 million miles in 376 hours, 34 minutes.

STS-99 (February 11–22, 2000) was an 11-day mission during which the international crew aboard &quot;Endeavour&quot; worked dual shifts to support payload operations. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission mapped more than 47 million miles of the Earth&#x27;s land surface. The STS-99 mission was accomplished in 181 Earth orbits, traveling over 4 million miles in 268 hours and 38 minutes.

<text>In atomic physics, the fine structure describes the splitting of the spectral lines of atoms due to electron spin and relativistic corrections to the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. It was first measured precisely for the hydrogen atom by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887, laying the basis for the theoretical treatment by Arnold Sommerfeld, introducing the fine-structure constant.

== Background ==

=== Gross structure ===
The &quot;gross structure&quot; of line spectra is the structure predicted by the quantum mechanics of non-relativistic electrons with no spin. For a hydrogenic atom, the gross structure energy levels only depend on the principal quantum number &quot;n&quot;. However, a more accurate model takes into account relativistic and spin effects, which break the degeneracy of the energy levels and split the spectral lines. The scale of the fine structure splitting relative to the gross structure energies is on the order of (&quot;Zα&quot;)2, where &quot;Z&quot; is the atomic number and &quot;α&quot; is the fine-structure constant, a dimensionless number equal to approximately 1/137.

=== Relativistic corrections ===
The fine structure energy corrections can be obtained by using perturbation theory. To perform this calculation one must add three corrective terms to the Hamiltonian: the leading order relativistic correction to the kinetic energy, the correction due to the spin–orbit coupling, and the Darwin term coming from the quantum fluctuating motion or zitterbewegung of the electron.

These corrections can also be obtained from the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac equation, since Dirac&#x27;s theory naturally incorporates relativity and spin interactions.

== Hydrogen atom ==
This section discusses the analytical solutions for the hydrogen atom as the problem is analytically solvable and is the base model for energy level calculations in more complex atoms.

=== Kinetic energy relativistic correction ===
The gross structure assumes the kinetic energy term of the Hamiltonian takes the same form as in classical mechanics, which for a single electron means
formula_1
where is the potential energy, formula_2 is the momentum, and formula_3 is the electron rest mass.

However, when considering a more accurate theory of nature via special relativity, we must use a relativistic form of the kinetic energy,
formula_4
where the first term is the total relativistic energy, and the second term is the rest energy of the electron (formula_5 is the speed of light). Expanding the square root for large values of formula_5, we find
formula_7

Although there are an infinite number of terms in this series, the later terms are much smaller than earlier terms, and so we can ignore all but the first two. Since the first term above is already part of the classical Hamiltonian, the first order &quot;correction&quot; to the Hamiltonian is
formula_8

Using this as a perturbation, we can calculate the first order energy corrections due to relativistic effects.
formula_9
where formula_10 is the unperturbed wave function. Recalling the unperturbed Hamiltonian, we see
formula_11

We can use this result to further calculate the relativistic correction:
formula_12

For the hydrogen atom,
formula_13 formula_14 and formula_15
where formula_16 is the elementary charge, formula_17 is the vacuum permittivity, formula_18 is the Bohr radius, formula_19 is the principal quantum number, formula_20 is the azimuthal quantum number and formula_21 is the distance of the electron from the nucleus. Therefore, the first order relativistic correction for the hydrogen atom is
formula_22
where we have used:
formula_23

On final calculation, the order of magnitude for the relativistic correction to the ground state is formula_24.

=== Spin–orbit coupling ===
For a hydrogen-like atom with formula_25 protons (formula_26 for hydrogen), orbital angular momentum formula_27 and electron spin formula_28, the spin–orbit term is given by:
formula_29
where formula_30 is the spin g-factor.

The spin–orbit correction can be understood by shifting from the standard frame of reference (where the electron orbits the nucleus) into one where the electron is stationary and the nucleus instead orbits it. In this case the orbiting nucleus functions as an effective current loop, which in turn will generate a magnetic field. However, the electron itself has a magnetic moment due to its intrinsic angular momentum. The two magnetic vectors, formula_31 and formula_32 couple together so that there is a certain energy cost depending on their relative orientation. This gives rise to the energy correction of the form
formula_33

Notice that an important factor of 2 has to be added to the calculation, called the Thomas precession, which comes from the relativistic calculation that changes back to the electron&#x27;s frame from the nucleus frame.

Since
formula_34
by Kramers–Pasternack relations and
formula_35
the expectation value for the Hamiltonian is:
formula_36

Thus the order of magnitude for the spin–orbital coupling is:
formula_37

When weak external magnetic fields are applied, the spin–orbit coupling contributes to the Zeeman effect.

=== Darwin term ===
There is one last term in the non-relativistic expansion of the Dirac equation. It is referred to as the Darwin term, as it was first derived by Charles Galton Darwin, and is given by:
formula_38

The Darwin term affects only the s orbitals. This is because the wave function of an electron with formula_39 vanishes at the origin, hence the delta function has no effect. For example, it gives the 2s orbital the same energy as the 2p orbital by raising the 2s state by .

The Darwin term changes potential energy of the electron. It can be interpreted as a smearing out of the electrostatic interaction between the electron and nucleus due to zitterbewegung, or rapid quantum oscillations, of the electron. This can be demonstrated by a short calculation.

Quantum fluctuations allow for the creation of virtual electron-positron pairs with a lifetime estimated by the uncertainty principle formula_40. The distance the particles can move during this time is formula_41, the Compton wavelength. The electrons of the atom interact with those pairs. This yields a fluctuating electron position formula_42. Using a Taylor expansion, the effect on the potential formula_43 can be estimated:
formula_44

Averaging over the fluctuations formula_45
formula_46
gives the average potential
formula_47

Approximating formula_48, this yields the perturbation of the potential due to fluctuations:
formula_49

To compare with the expression above, plug in the Coulomb potential:
formula_50

This is only slightly different.

Another mechanism that affects only the s-state is the Lamb shift, a further, smaller correction that arises in quantum electrodynamics that should not be confused with the Darwin term. The Darwin term gives the s-state and p-state the same energy, but the Lamb shift makes the s-state higher in energy than the p-state.

=== Total effect ===

The full Hamiltonian is given by
formula_51
where formula_52 is the Hamiltonian from the Coulomb interaction.

The total effect, obtained by summing the three components up, is given by the following expression:
formula_53
where formula_54 is the total angular momentum quantum number (formula_55 if formula_56 and formula_57 otherwise). It is worth noting that this expression was first obtained by Sommerfeld based on the old Bohr theory; i.e., before the modern quantum mechanics was formulated.
=== Exact relativistic energies ===

The total effect can also be obtained by using the Dirac equation. The exact energies are given by
formula_58

This expression, which contains all higher order terms that were left out in the other calculations, expands to first order to give the energy corrections derived from perturbation theory. However, this equation does not contain the hyperfine structure corrections, which are due to interactions with the nuclear spin. Other corrections from quantum field theory such as the Lamb shift and the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron are not included.

<doc id="610207" wikidata="Q449745" url="?curid=610207" title="Jane Swift">
<text>Jane Maria Swift (born February 24, 1965) is an American politician and nonprofit executive who served as the 69th lieutenant governor of Massachusetts from 1999 to 2003 and, concurrently, as acting governor from April 2001 to January 2003. She was the first woman to perform the duties of governor of Massachusetts. At the time she became acting governor, Swift was 36 years old, making her the youngest female governor in U.S. history.

==Early life and education==
Swift grew up in a large extended family in North Adams, Massachusetts. Her maternal grandmother immigrated to the United States from northern Italy after World War I, and her paternal grandfather was a Plymouth, Massachusetts native with roots in Ireland as well as on the Mayflower. She learned politics from her father, Jack Swift. who ran the family HVAC business and was active in the Berkshire County Republican Party. Swift&#x27;s mother, a graduate of North Adams State College, was a teacher in area public and parochial schools. Swift attended North Adams public schools, and in 1987 graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, with a degree in American studies. During her college years, Swift held work-study jobs in the college dining hall and with the Religion &amp; Philosophy Department, played on the women&#x27;s rugby team, and was a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.

==Career==

In 1990, at the age of 25, Swift was the youngest woman ever elected to the Massachusetts Senate. She served the Berkshire, Hampshire, Franklin, and Hampden Massachusetts Senate district from 1991 to 1997 and was active in education reform. She was instrumental in the passage of the Education Reform Act of 1993, which created the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, one of the nation&#x27;s first statewide programs for quantifying academic performance.

According to Governor Bill Weld&#x27;s chief of staff, &quot;She was among the best, if not the best of senators.&quot; It was in this capacity that she developed political themes of increased accountability, smaller government, fiscal responsibility, and reforming education and social services.

In 1996, rather than seek re-election to the Senate, Swift was the Republican nominee for United States Congress in Massachusetts&#x27;s 1st congressional district. She lost to a popular two-term incumbent Democratic Congressman, John Olver, by four points.

Swift went on to serve as an executive with the Massachusetts Port Authority, and was later appointed by Governor Weld as Massachusetts&#x27; consumer affairs secretary in 1997. She served in that post until she was elected lieutenant governor in 1998, in a campaign that was notable not only for her relative youth but also for the fact that she was pregnant with her first child, Elizabeth, whom she gave birth to just a few weeks before election day.

During her time as lieutenant governor, Swift faced significant scrutiny for her choices as a high-profile working mother. She was especially criticized for using staff members to watch her daughter, and for her Massachusetts State Police detail&#x27;s use of a helicopter to avoid Thanksgiving traffic en route to her home in The Berkshires when her baby was sick. In an ethics ruling that Swift herself requested, she was found to be in violation of state guidelines for the babysitting and she paid a fine of $1250, but she was cleared of wrongdoing on the question of the use of the helicopter and on allegations that staffers helped her move from one Boston-area apartment to another. Twenty years later, Boston reporter Joanna Weiss reflected on the gender bias that faced Swift throughout her tenure.

=== Tenure as governor ===

Swift became acting governor of Massachusetts in April 2001 when Governor Paul Cellucci was appointed United States Ambassador to Canada by President George W. Bush. In Massachusetts, a vacancy in the governor&#x27;s office is filled by the lieutenant governor, who serves as acting governor without formally taking on the office. She was pregnant with twins at the time, and became the first sitting governor in U.S. history to give birth when her twin daughters, Lauren and Sarah Hunt, were born one month into her term of office. She made national headlines when she continued to exercise executive authority during her maternity leave, including chairing a meeting of the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council by teleconference while on bed rest for preterm labor. Members of the Democratic-controlled Governor&#x27;s Council objected, contesting her authority to convene official meetings while on leave.

Swift won widespread praise for her response to the September 11 attacks in 2001 and for her management of the fiscal crisis that followed in Massachusetts. On the day of the attacks, Swift insisted that polls remain open for a special congressional primary election scheduled for that day, and later led a comprehensive, statewide response to prevent further acts of terrorism. In addition, Swift led 45 governors in urging Congress to create the Department of Homeland Security. The &quot;Boston Herald&quot; summarized her response to the crisis, stating, &quot;Acting Gov. Jane Swift has had her finest hour during this crisis...she has been steady, stable, calming, decisive.&quot; After it was learned that some hijackers boarded planes at Logan International Airport in Boston, Swift came under political pressure and forced the CEO of Massport to resign.

Faced with a widening budget deficit in the aftermath of the attacks, Swift cut nearly $300 million in programs and vetoed nearly $600 million in proposed spending. She received high praise from the Massachusetts High Tech Council for her response to the budget crisis without resorting to massive tax increases.

Her tenure as acting governor was not without controversy. In February 2002, she drew criticism for her refusal to commute the thirty-to-forty-year sentence of Gerald Amirault, who was convicted in the 1986 Fells Acres day care sexual abuse trial and who had already served 16 years in prison. Her decision, which went against the unanimous recommendation of the state parole board, came at the urging of Martha Coakley, then Middlesex County District Attorney and subsequently State Attorney General. Both Coakley&#x27;s and Swift&#x27;s motives in denying Amirault clemency have been impugned as politically inspired.

Swift received a grade of B in 2002 for her fiscal policies. from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America&#x27;s Governors.

====Cabinet and administration====
====2002 gubernatorial campaign====
In October 2001, Swift announced that she would run for a full term as governor in the 2002 election. In January 2002 she named Patrick Guerriero, her deputy chief of staff, as her running mate. Guerriero became the nation&#x27;s first openly gay candidate for lieutenant governor.

Despite her widely praised response to the September 11 attacks, Swift&#x27;s popularity was damaged by political missteps and personal controversies. Many Republicans viewed her as unable to win a general election against a Democrat and campaigned to persuade businessman Mitt Romney to run for governor. On March 17, a &quot;Boston Herald&quot; poll showed Romney defeating Swift in a Republican primary by a 75 percent to 12 percent margin. On March 19, 2002, Swift declared that she had decided not to seek her party&#x27;s nomination, citing family reasons and also saying, &quot;I believe that this is in the best interest of our state, as it will allow the Republican Party&#x27;s best chances of holding the governor&#x27;s office in November.&quot; Three hours later, Romney announced his candidacy and he went on to defeat Democrat Shannon O&#x27;Brien in the general election.

Swift&#x27;s official portrait was unveiled in the Massachusetts State House in 2005.

==== Involvement in 2008 presidential campaign ====
A skilled campaigner and fundraiser, Swift continued to be considered a &quot;power player&quot; within the Republican Party. She endorsed Senator John McCain for president in February 2007 and campaigned on his behalf throughout 2008. Swift appeared on news and political commentary shows, providing point/counterpoint discussion on the campaign. Swift also decried sexist criticism of vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin.

===Post-political life and work===

After leaving public office, Swift moved back to the Berkshires while continuing to work in Boston and throughout the U.S. as an education executive, consultant and venture capital partner with special expertise in education technology. She has received six honorary doctorates, served as a fellow at Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government, is a frequent speaker on the role of women in public service and the challenges of integrating work and family, is a contributor to &quot;Working Mother Magazine&quot;, and was a lecturer in Leadership Studies at Williams College. Swift and her husband owned and operated Cobble Hill Farm, a horse boarding facility and riding school in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where they lived with their three daughters before relocating to Vermont.

Swift became CEO of Middlebury Interactive Languages (MIL) from August 2011 until April 2017.

On July 1, 2019 Swift became the president and executive director of LearnLaunch, a nonprofit education innovation organization.

The former governor&#x27;s philanthropic work has focused on issues of importance to women and girls. She has held trustee positions, board memberships, and advisory roles both domestically and abroad, for organizations including:
* Sally Ride Science
* School of Leadership – Afghanistan
* Oxfam America&#x27;s Sisters on the Planet VoteRunLead
* Champlain College
Swift completed the Boston Marathon in 2008, running as part of the fundraising team for Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital.

In 2015, Swift signed an amicus brief to the United States Supreme Court in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage.

== Personal life ==
In 1994, Swift, aged 29, married Charles T. Hunt III, a dairy farmer and physical education teacher. Swift and Hunt have three daughters, two of whom were born during her tenure as acting governor, thus making her the first sitting governor to give birth while in office. Her eldest daughter, Elizabeth Hunt, is a 2017 graduate of Vermont&#x27;s Rice Memorial High School in Burlington and a December 2021 graduate with a B.S. in Math from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, while her other two daughters, Lauren and Sarah, graduated from Burr &amp; Burton Academy in Manchester, Vermont, in 2019. Swift&#x27;s husband, who became the first First Gentleman in Massachusetts history, died on December 21, 2021, from kidney disease.

<text>Who&#x27;s Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe (1985–87), usually referred to simply as Who&#x27;s Who, is the umbrella title for a number of comic book series which DC Comics published to catalogue the wide variety of fictional characters in their imaginary universe, the DC Universe.

==History==
&quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; was the creation of Len Wein, Marv Wolfman, and Robert Greenberger, and its first incarnation (&quot;Who&#x27;s Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe&quot;) debuted in the last month of 1984 (cover-dated March 1985) and ran for 26 issues until 1987 (cover-dated April 1987). It was essentially an encyclopedia in comic book form, listing the characters, places, and technology in the DC Universe, with a loose leaf format devised by editor Michael Eury. It began one month before the 12-issue limited series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; began; therefore, the earlier issues discuss Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; versions of the characters, whereas issues released after the conclusion of the limited series discuss the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; versions. For example, while both the Flash and Supergirl died during the &quot;Crisis&quot;, the Flash&#x27;s death is not mentioned as issue #8 predates his death, but Supergirl&#x27;s death is recounted 14 months later in issue #22. Also, characters such as Superman and Wonder Woman were rebooted during the series&#x27; run, so their entries recounted their Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; histories only, while their entire Silver Age histories (and all the unique elements of those characters during that time, such as Superman&#x27;s Fortress of Solitude and Wonder Woman&#x27;s powerless period) were ignored.

&quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; was DC&#x27;s answer to &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot;, which was published a few years earlier. Each character had an individualized logo instead of a standard typeface; figures were shown in action poses rather than full-body portraits drawn by individual artists; character histories and power descriptions were more vague; and characters from all of DC&#x27;s various lines and imprints were included (such as out-of-continuity series like &quot;Camelot 3000&quot; and &quot;Watchmen&quot;), not just those from its shared universe (although &quot;Who&#x27;s Who Update &#x27;88&quot; did limit its entries to in-continuity series only).

Various updated versions of the &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; have appeared over the years, including &quot;Who&#x27;s Who Update &#x27;87&quot; (five issues, cover dated August to December 1987) and &quot;Who&#x27;s Who Update &#x27;88&quot; (four issues, cover dated August to November 1988). Both books featured new entries, revised entries for characters in previous volumes, and an Appendix which included minor updates and corrections for previous entries. In 1989, most of the DC &quot;Annual&quot;s released that year included &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entries. Many of these were revised versions of entries in the regular &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; series, but there were several new entries (particularly for supporting characters).

DC Comics also put out two &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; spin-off series in the 1980s. The first was &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Star Trek&quot;, a two-issue series (cover-dated March and April 1987) which profiled many of the people and places from the 1960s &quot;Star Trek&quot; series (and subsequent movies), the 1970s animated series and the 1980s &quot;Star Trek&quot; comic book published by DC. As the series was released prior to the premiere of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, no information from that series was included.

The second spin-off was &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;, a seven-issue series (cover-dated April to November 1988) which expanded on the Legion information included in the regular &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; and featured profiles on the various supporting characters, organizations, locations and villains which have appeared in Legion stories over the years. Some of the information contained in this book was Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; instead of Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;. For example, the Superboy profile relates the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; origin of the character as a creation of the Time Trapper, and there is no profile for Supergirl, despite her many adventures with the Legion, since by this time she was written out of continuity.

In 1990, DC started over with a new &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; series titled &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the DC Universe&quot; (16 loose-leaf issues with binders sold separately, cover-dated August 1990 to February 1992). This book was not as comprehensive as the previous &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; (for example, there was no entry for the Atom, even though his character was undergoing major changes in the comic &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;), and some of the entries took on a less serious tone. One instance is an entry for Guy Gardner, which is written from the character&#x27;s perspective. Another instance is a blank entry for Death, which has all the usual information headings crossed out and blue marker scrawl stating simply &quot;Someday you&#x27;ll meet her. You can find out for yourself&quot;.

This series was followed up by &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the DC Universe Update 1993&quot; (two loose-leaf issues, cover-dated December 1992 and January 1993). DC also released a &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; series for their Impact Comics line (three loose-leaf issues, cover-dated September 1991 to May 1992).

During the period from the late 1990s through the end of the 2000s, &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; was replaced with &quot;Secret Files and Origins&quot;, a series of one-shots devoted to particular characters or events in the DC Universe and which feature &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;-like profiles. DK Publishing has also released a number of &quot;Ultimate Guides&quot;, as well as a book titled &quot;The DC Comics Encyclopedia&quot;, which serve a similar purpose.

In December 2009, DC announced a new &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; series to be published in 2010 as part of the company&#x27;s 75th anniversary celebration. The series was later announced for 18 issues, 48 pages per issue, beginning in May 2010 with Bob Greenberger as sole writer and Bob Harras as editor. The series launch was subsequently delayed, but in October DC vice-president Dan DiDio stated that the series would be released after the 2011 DCU line-wide event, &quot;Flashpoint&quot;. The history of the DC Universe received an extensive overhaul in the aftermath of said &quot;Flashpoint&quot; event. The resulting &quot;New 52&quot; comics are set in a greatly altered continuity, making a new edition of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; unlikely in the short term because the histories of many characters are in a state of flux.

In 2022, &quot;The New Golden Age&quot; one-shot included 12 new &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;-style entries: Aquaman, Betsy Ross and Molly Pitcher, Cherry Bomb, Harlequin&#x27;s Son, John Henry Jr., Ladybug, Legionnaire, Mister Miracle, Quiz Kid, Red Lantern, Salem the Witch Girl, and The Boom.

In 2023, the &quot;DC Power: A Celebration&quot; one-shot included 10 new &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;-style entries: Amazing-Man, Aquaman (Jackson Hyde), Batman (Jace Fox), Batwing, Nubia, Green Lantern (Jo Mullein), Green Lantern (John Stewart), Kid Flash (Ace West), Thunder/Lightning, and Vixen.

The &quot;DC Power 2024&quot; one-shot included five new &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;-style entries: Black Manta, Mister Terrific (Michael Holt), The Signal, The Spectre (Crispus Allen), and Val-Zod.

<doc id="610211" wikidata="Q4542504" url="?curid=610211" title="Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for releasing albums in the Latin pop genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Throughout its history, this award has had minor name changes: &quot;Best Latin Pop Performance&quot; (1984–1991, 1995–2000), &quot;Best Latin Pop or Urban Album&quot; (1992–1994, 2021) and &quot;Best Latin Pop Album&quot; since 2022. In 2012 the award was not presented due to a major overhaul of Grammy categories. That year recordings in this category were shifted to the newly formed &quot;Best Latin Pop, Rock or Urban Album&quot;. However, later that year, the Board of Trustees announced that it would be bringing back the category for the 55th Grammy Awards in 2013 with the following description: &quot;for albums containing at least 51 percent playing time of new vocal or instrumental Latin pop recordings&quot;. In June 2020, the Recording Academy decided to move the Latin urban genre from the Best Latin Rock, Alternative or Urban Album category to this category, as &quot;the Latin urban genre, both aesthetically and musically, is much more closely related to the current state of Latin pop.&quot; However, from 2022, Latin urban music has been honored with its own separate category: Best Música Urbana Album.

From 1984 to 1991, the category allowed single tracks or albums, and as of 1992 only includes albums. Beginning in 1998, members of the Latin Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences (LARAS) are eligible to vote in the Latin field of the Grammy Award categories. Puerto Rican singer José Feliciano was the first awarded in the category for his album &quot;Me Enamoré&quot; (1984). Feliciano and Spanish singer Alejandro Sanz are the biggest winners with four accolades each. The most nominated performer is Mexican singer Luis Miguel with twelve nominations that resulted in three wins, including his consecutive awards for &quot;Aries&quot; (1994) and &quot;Segundo Romance&quot; (1995). In 1998, Spanish artists Enrique Iglesias and Julio Iglesias, father and son, where nominated against each other for their albums &quot;Vivir&quot; and &quot;Tango&quot;, respectively, losing both to Miguel&#x27;s &quot;Romances&quot;. Guatemalan singer-songwriter Ricardo Arjona and Mexican musician Julieta Venegas tied in 2007 for their albums &quot;Adentro&quot; and &quot;Limón y Sal&quot;, respectively.

Panamanian artist Rubén Blades has received the award three times, in 2000, 2015 and 2023, and also has been recognized in other fields, with winning albums for Tropical Latin Album and World Music Album. Laura Pausini became the first Italian female artist to win a Grammy Award with the album &quot;Escucha&quot; in 2006. &quot;No Es lo Mismo&quot; by Sanz, &quot;La Vida... Es un Ratico&quot; and &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; by Colombian artist Juanes, and &quot;Vida&quot; by Puerto Rican singer-songwriter Draco Rosa won the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album and also received the Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Shakira became the first female performer to receive the honor three times, with her winning albums &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (2001), &quot;El Dorado&quot; (2018) and &quot;Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran&quot; (2025). As of 2025, Mexican singer José José is the most nominated performer without a win with six unsuccessful nominations.

<doc id="610212" wikidata="Q5631901" url="?curid=610212" title="HMS Cleopatra (F28)">
<text>HMS &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (F28) was a &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigate of the Royal Navy (RN). &quot;Cleopatra&quot; was built at HMNB Devonport. She was launched on 21 March 1964, commissioned on 1 March 1966 and decommissioned on 31 January 1992.

==Construction==
&quot;Cleopatra&quot; was ordered during 1962 as the 10th ship of the &quot;Leander&quot;-class. The ship was laid down at Devonport Dockyard on 19 June 1963, was launched on 21 March 1964 and completed on 4 January 1966. She commissioned with the Pennant number F28 and International Callsign &#x27;GMLU&#x27; on 1 March 1966.

&quot;Cleopatra&quot; was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. The ship was fitted with Y-100 machinery, built by Cammell Laird. Two oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers fed steam at and to a pair of double reduction geared steam turbines that in turn drove two propeller shafts, with the machinery rated at , giving a speed of .

A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward. Anti-aircraft defence was provided by a quadruple Sea Cat surface-to-air missile launcher on the hangar roof, while two Oerlikon 20 mm cannon for close-in defence against surface targets. A Limbo anti-submarine mortar was fitted aft to provide a short-range anti-submarine capability, while a hangar and helicopter deck allowed a single Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, for longer range anti-submarine and anti-surface operations.

As built, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; was fitted with a large Type 965 long range air search radar on the ship&#x27;s mainmast, with a Type 993 short range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 974 navigation radar carried on the ship&#x27;s foremast. An MRS3 fire control system was carried over the ship&#x27;s bridge to direct the 4.5-inch guns, while a GWS22 director for Seacat was mounted on the hangar roof. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 177 medium range search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar, together with a Type 199 variable depth sonar (VDS).

==Operational Service==
Upon &quot;Cleopatra&quot; commissioning, she was deployed to the Far East Fleet, joining the 2nd Destroyer Squadron, then returned Britain in 1967 where she served as a training ship at Portland for several months before returning to the Far East. Duties included participation in the Beira Patrol, which was designed to prevent oil reaching the landlocked Rhodesia via Lorenzo Marques (now Maputo) in the then Portuguese colony of Mozambique.

In 1969, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; was present at the Evans-Melbourne collision.

&quot;Cleopatra&quot; was refitted at Devonport from May to September 1970.

Following work up at Portland in 1971, CLEOPATRA visited the West Indies and USA with HMS ARK ROYAL and RFAs OLMEDA and REGENT. In August 1971 CLEOPATRA deployed to the Far East via South Africa and joined the Singapore-based ANZUK force in December.

In February/March 1972, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; took part in escort duties during the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s South East Asia tour.

In 1972, on passage from Singapore to undertake Beira Patrol, HMS &quot;Cleopatra&quot; helicopter crash landed into the sea. The helo was hoisted and secured on the ship&#x27;s starboard side, taken to RAF Gan in the Maldives, and loaded on to a raft before transport to UK by the RAF. Cleopatra relieved HMS &quot;Lowestoft&quot; on Beira Patrol and &#x27;borrowed&#x27; her Wasp helicopter for the remainder of her deployment.

In 1973, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; was dispatched to protect British trawlers against the Icelandic Coast Guard in the Second Cod War.

In May 1973 &quot;Cleopatra&quot; began a major modernisation at Devonport, becoming the first Leander-class ship to undergo the Batch 2 conversion. The conversion included the removal and replacement of all the ship&#x27;s armament. The Mark 6 4.5-in gun mount was replaced by four Exocet anti-ship missiles. The Limbo anti-submarine mortar was removed to give a larger flight deck and the ship&#x27;s hangar was enlarged to allow a Westland Lynx helicopter to be operated, while two triple STWS torpedo tubes provided short range anti-submarine capability. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of one Seacat launcher mounted forward of the Exocet containers and two more mounted aft on the hangar roof, backed up by two Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns on the bridge wings. Type 1006 navigation radar replaced the old Type 974 radar, while the MRS3 gun control director as replaced by a GWS22 director for the forward Seacat launcher, with a second Seacat director mounted aft. Type 184M sonar replaced the main hull sonar, while the VDS was removed and its well plated over. Displacement rose to standard and , with speed falling by two knots.

&quot;Cleopatra&quot; recommissioned after her reconstruction in late 1975 and joined the 4th Frigate Squadron as leader.
In 1977, &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, like many other Leanders, took part in the Fleet Review of the RN in celebration of HM the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. &quot;Cleopatra&quot; was positioned in the middle of HM ships &quot;Zulu&quot; and &quot;Arethusa&quot;.

The National Archives records that the Ministry of Defence has a file of details of intelligence collection by &quot;Cleopatra&quot; in January to March 1978. She was refitted again at Devonport in 1978. In 1981, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean, which still had a large RN presence at the time.

In 1982 &quot;Cleopatra&quot; returned to Devonport to be converted to carry the new Type 1031 towed array sonar. To accommodate the new sonar changes were made to reduce topweight. The forward Seacat launcher and director was removed, as was the long-range Type 965 radar, allowing the ship&#x27;s mainmast to be replaced by a smaller mast. The Bofors guns were replaced by lighter Oerlikon 20 mm guns while the ship&#x27;s boats were removed and the Exocet launchers and torpedo tubes lowered. A large cable reel was fitted to the aft end of the flight deck, while the Type 2031 I towed array sonar consisted of an acoustic array of passive hydrophones which were towed on the end of a cable. The electronics needed to extract and display the sonar data was installed in the ship&#x27;s hangar, which meant that &quot;Cleopatra&quot; was no longer able to operate a helicopter. &quot;Cleopatra&quot; completed her refit on 10 June 1983, the first &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigate to be fitted with a towed array.

The ship visited America in January–March 1984, and in 1985 was leader of the 7th Frigate Squadron. Further duties were undertaken but by the late 1980s, &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s&quot; age was beginning to show and her time was coming to an end. On 31 January 1992, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; was decommissioned. The following year, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; was sold for scrap.

<text>Timothy James Salmon (born August 24, 1968), nicknamed &quot;King Fish&quot;, is an American former professional baseball player and current sportcaster. He played his entire career in Major League Baseball (MLB) from to with the California / Anaheim / Los Angeles Angels as an outfielder and designated hitter. Salmon was an integral member of the Angels team that won the 2002 World Series. He is an analyst for Bally Sports West&#x27;s &quot;Angels Live&quot; pre-and-postgame shows.

Salmon is considered one of the most prolific and beloved players in Angels history. At the time of his retirement, Salmon had the most home runs in Angels history with 299, since surpassed by Mike Trout in 2020. He was inducted into the Angels Hall of Fame in 2015.

==Early life==
Salmon was born on August 24, 1968, in Long Beach, California, and was raised in the Belmont Shore neighborhood of the city. When he was three years old, Salmon provoked a two-hour search after he wandered out of the house and was found watching games at the baseball field in a local park. Salmon&#x27;s parents divorced when he was young, causing him to initially move to Texas with his mother and brother before splitting time between there and his father&#x27;s house in Arizona under joint custody. Salmon cites his older brother and grandmother as sources of stability in his childhood.

Salmon attended Greenway High School in Phoenix, Arizona. He was a three-sport varsity athlete, primarily playing baseball and football while also playing basketball. As a member of the school&#x27;s football team, Salmon played various positions, mostly punter and wide receiver, and received scouting interest from various college football programs. As a senior in 1986, Salmon was a member of a state championship-winning Babe Ruth League team. At the age of 17, he was drafted in the 18th round by the Atlanta Braves in the 1986 amateur draft but he did not sign. In high school, Salmon was undecided about which sport to pursue, but he ultimately chose to join Grand Canyon University&#x27;s baseball team. In 1988, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Salmon was selected by the California Angels in the third round of the 1989 MLB Draft, the 69th overall pick. He was initially assigned to the Bend Bucks, an Angels affiliate in the Class A Short Season Northwest League. In his first minor league season, Salmon posted a .245 batting average with 6 home runs and 31 RBIs in 55 games. In 1990, he was promoted to the A-Advanced Palm Springs Angels. During a May 26 game against the San Bernardino Spirit, Salmon was hit in the face by Kerry Woodson&#x27;s fastball, fracturing his jaw. He was hospitalized and had his jaw wired shut, sidelining him for a large portion of the season. One doctor likened Salmon&#x27;s injury to &quot;breaking glass in a sock,&quot; but Salmon stated he didn&#x27;t feel any pain. Up until the injury, he was batting .288 with 2 home runs and 21 RBIs in 36 games. Salmon returned to the field in 1990 with the Double-A Midland Angels, posting a .268 batting average with 3 home runs and 16 RBIs in 27 games. He spent all of 1991 with Midland, batting .245 and hitting 23 home runs with 94 RBIs in 131 games. In the 1992 season, Salmon was promoted to play for the Triple-A Edmonton Trappers, batting .347 with 29 home runs and 105 RBIs, all of which were new career highs in his minor league tenure. He won the Baseball America Minor League Player of the Year Award that season.

===Major leagues===
====1992–1995: Early success, Rookie of the Year====
On August 20, 1992, Salmon was called up to the big leagues by the Angels. Some baseball media members considered Salmon to be the most anticipated Angels call-up since Wally Joyner in 1986. He made his MLB debut on August 21, starting in right field and going 0-for-4 with a walk against the New York Yankees in Yankee Stadium. Salmon recorded his first hit the next day, a single off of Yankees starter Mélido Pérez in the 7th inning. He recorded his first career home run on August 23, a solo shot to left field off eventual teammate Scott Sanderson in the 4th inning. In his brief first season in the majors, Salmon batted .177 with 2 home runs and 6 RBIs in 23 games.

In 1993, Salmon joined the team as the everyday starter in right field for his true rookie season. By August, Salmon was batting .279 with 23 home runs and 71 RBIs, earning him media consideration as the frontrunner for the American League&#x27;s Rookie of the Year award. Salmon finished the season batting .283 with 31 home runs and 95 RBIs. He won the American League Rookie of the Year award, only the fourth AL player ever to receive a unanimous vote.

Salmon started his 1994 season slow. Through May 3, he was batting .225 with 3 home runs, a point at which Angels hitting instructor Rod Carew had a meeting with Salmon, persuading him to be more aggressive at the plate. He took Carew&#x27;s advice and results quickly followed: in a three-game stretch from May 10 to May 13, Salmon compiled a total of 13 hits, joining Joe Cronin and Walt Dropo in a three-way tie for the most hits in a three-game period in American League history. The set of games included a 5-for-5 performance with 2 home runs in a blowout victory over the Seattle Mariners in the Kingdome on May 13, raising his season batting average to .336 by the end of the day. Salmon received the AL Player of the Week Award for May 9–May 15, a first for his career. He finished the strike-shortened season batting .287 with 23 home runs and 70 RBIs in 100 games.

1995 was one of Salmon&#x27;s career-best years at the plate. He set career highs in batting average at .330, on-base plus slugging (OPS) at 1.024, hits with 177, runs with 111, and total bases with 319. He received a Silver Slugger Award that year, and his 6.6 wins above replacement (WAR) ranked 7th among all players and 5th among position players in the American League. He placed 7th in AL Most Valuable Player Award voting.

====1996–1999: Move to cleanup spot====
With the emergence of Angels left fielder Garret Anderson in the previous season and continued production from center fielder Jim Edmonds, Salmon was the eldest of a young outfield that some members of the media considered to be second-best in the AL, only behind the Cleveland Indians trio of Albert Belle, Kenny Lofton, and Manny Ramirez. Through April 1996, Salmon was batting .281 with 3 home runs and 11 RBIs. By the All-Star break, he was batting .293 with 22 home runs and 58 RBIs, but he did not receive an All-Star selection. Salmon finished the season batting .286 with a team-leading 30 home runs and 98 RBIs. He led AL right fielders in putouts with 302 and was second in right fielder assists with 13. He led the AL in most games played in the outfield with 153.

In 1997, Salmon was moved to the cleanup spot for the first time in his career after primarily batting third every year since his true rookie season. The move resulted in an increased amount of RBIs for Salmon, including 60 before the All-Star break. Salmon finished the year batting .296 with 33 home runs and set career-highs in plate appearances with 695, At bats with 582, and RBIs with 129. He drove in Darin Erstad 23 times and Dave Hollins 22 times. He led AL outfielders in double plays with 5 and right field assists with 15. His 129 RBIs ranked 7th in the major leagues. He finished seventh in AL MVP voting, receiving 84 points and a 21% share.

During spring training in 1998, Salmon suffered a strain to his Achilles tendon but was able to continue playing. On April 22, Salmon left the game in the third inning after straining the arch in his left foot. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list and would not return until May 9. Salmon was named the AL Player of the Week for August 9, a span in which he batted .480 with 12 hits, 4 home runs, and 9 RBIs. He finished the season batting .300 with 26 home runs and 88 RBI. His .410 on-base percentage (OBP) ranked fourth in the American League. Salmon maintained his status as the cleanup batter throughout the year, making 93 of his 130 starts there.

Salmon received the third AL Player of the Week award of his career on April 18, 1999, after batting .481 with 2 home runs and 12 RBIs. On May 3, Salmon was removed from a game with an injury to his left wrist; X-rays taken that evening were negative and he was diagnosed with a sprain. On May 11, Salmon was placed on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to May 4. Salmon missed 62 games with the injury and did not return until July 17. He finished the 1999 season batting .266 with 17 home runs and 69 RBIs in 98 games.

====2000–2002: Veteran presence and World Series====
With longtime pitcher Chuck Finley departing the team after 1999 and shortstop Gary DiSarcina playing his final MLB game on May 8, Salmon became the longest-tenured player on the field for the Angels early in the 2000 season. He received his fourth career AL Player of the Week award on August 6 after batting .583 with 2 home runs and 7 RBIs. On August 18, Salmon hit a fourth-inning home run off Roger Clemens, the 223rd home run of his career, surpassing Brian Downing for the most in Angels history. He earned the Player of the Week award again for August 27 after batting .500 with 2 home runs, one of which gave him his 30th on the year and made the Angels the first AL team that season to have four different players hit 30 home runs. His season stats improved from his injury-shortened 1999 season, batting .290 with 34 home runs and 97 RBIs while setting career highs in games played with 158 and walks with 104. His 108 runs scored ranked 10th in the AL and his 4 outfield double plays ranked second.

During the 2000–01 offseason, Salmon underwent surgery on both his right foot and his left shoulder, preventing him from conducting his regular weight training regimen. During spring training, he suffered a strain on his abdomen. Before the start of the season, Salmon, who was about to finish a four-year contract, briefly considered signing with the Arizona Diamondbacks, but instead signed a four-year, $40-million extension with the Angels. Through the first month of the 2001 season, Salmon batted .233 with 3 home runs, 10 RBIs, and 12 strikeouts. His struggles continued throughout the season and his batting average dipped to a season-low .195 on May 26. By the end of the season, he was batting .227, a career-low when excluding his abbreviated 1992 call-up season. He hit 17 home runs and 49 RBIs in 137 games. Team manager Mike Scioscia attributed Salmon&#x27;s struggles to the two surgeries and spring training injury he endured.

In 2002, Salmon&#x27;s regular season stats rebounded as he batted .286 with 22 home runs and 88 RBIs in 138 games. He helped lead the Angels to a 99-win season and a berth into the 2002 American League Division Series as the wild card team – it was the first postseason appearance of Salmon&#x27;s career and the first for the Angels franchise since the 1986 American League Championship Series. During the ALDS, Salmon went 5-for-19 (.263) with 2 home runs and 7 RBIs in the team&#x27;s 3–1 series victory over the New York Yankees. During the 2002 American League Championship Series, he went 3-for-14 (.214) with 3 walks as the Angels sealed their first ever American League pennant and a trip to the World Series with a 4–1 series victory over the Minnesota Twins. During Game 2 of the 2002 World Series, Salmon went 4-for-4 with 2 home runs, the first being a 2-run home run off Russ Ortiz in the second inning to make the score 7–4 Angels and the second also coming as a 2-run home run off of Félix Rodríguez to break the tie and give the Angels the 11–9 lead en route to their 11–10 victory. In Game 3, Salmon went 1-for-4 with an RBI, 2 walks, and 2 runs scored, and a stolen base. During Game 6, he went 2-for-4. Overall, Salmon went 9-for-26 (.346) with 2 home runs, 5 RBIs, 4 walks, and a 1.067 OPS as the Angels defeated the San Francisco Giants to win their first ever World Series. Salmon posted a 21.89% championship win probability added (cWPA) during the series, the highest out of anyone on the team and second-highest in the series behind Barry Bonds&#x27;s 22.94%.

====2003–2006: Surgery and final seasons====
In 2003, his age-34 season, Salmon faced a positional change for the first time in his career as he platooned with Jeff DaVanon in right field and made the rest of his appearances as a designated hitter. He played 78 games in right field and 68 as the designated hitter. He finished the season batting .275 with 19 home runs and 72 RBIs.

In 2004, Salmon&#x27;s stint as a primary outfielder for the team effectively came to an end as he was the designated hitter in 39 appearances, pinch hitter in 14, and outfielder in 8. Through 60 games, Salmon was batting .253 with 2 home runs and 23 RBIs. On July 26, Salmon told the media that he was contemplating retiring after the 2005 season, the extent of his contract. On August 12, it was announced that Salmon would need surgery for his torn rotator cuff and biceps tendon. He signaled a desire to finish out the season and help the Angels in their playoff hunt before undergoing the procedure. By August 29, Salmon was experiencing too much pain in his arm to swing a bat but still said he hoped to return that season; he was placed on the 15-day disabled list in the meantime. On September 1, Salmon decided to undergo the surgery that would end his 2004 season and likely sideline him for all of 2005 due to its expected eight-to-10 month recovery window. Because Salmon&#x27;s contract was due to expire following the 2005 season, there was speculation that the injury and subsequent surgery could be career-ending. As expected, Salmon missed all of the 2005 season while recovering.

In January 2006, a 37-year-old Salmon was extended a non-roster invite to spring training. Following spring training, Salmon made the major league roster and signed a one-year deal worth $400,000 to serve as a designated hitter. On May 13, Salmon hit the 1,000th RBI of his career, following Garret Anderson as the second player in Angels history to drive in 1,000 runs for the franchise. On September 28, Salmon announced he would officially retire at the end of the 2006 season. He played his final major league game on October 1, 2006, against the Oakland Athletics. His name and jersey number were cut into the infield and outfield grass of the playing field at Angel Stadium. Salmon finished his major league career with a .282 batting average, 1,674 hits, 299 home runs, 1,016 RBIs, 986 runs scored, 48 stolen bases, a .385 OBP, .498 SLG, 128 OPS+, 40.5 WAR, and 1,672 games played.

==Legacy==

As of 2025, Salmon is the Angels&#x27; all-time leader in walks (965). He is second in franchise history with 299 home runs, 1,016 RBIs and 986 runs scored. He is one of only three Angels players to have won the Rookie of the Year award, the others being Mike Trout in 2012 and Shohei Ohtani in 2018.

Salmon returned to Angel Stadium as a player in the 2010 All-Star Legends &amp; Celebrity Softball Game where he received a standing ovation before hitting two home runs for the American League and receiving the game&#x27;s MVP award.

Salmon&#x27;s jersey number, 15, has not been officially retired by the Angels. The number was out of circulation from his retirement until the team issued it to Randal Grichuk in 2023. On August 22, 2015, Salmon was inducted into the Angels Hall of Fame alongside former pitchers Dean Chance and Mike Witt during a pregame ceremony at Angel Stadium. On August 29, 2016, he was inducted into the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame with a ceremony at Smith&#x27;s Ballpark in Salt Lake City, the home of the Angels&#x27; Triple-A affiliate Salt Lake Bees.

==Personal life==
Salmon, his wife Marci, and their four children reside in Scottsdale, Arizona. While Salmon was with the Angels, the family lived in Newport Beach, California. His son played baseball while his daughter played softball.

Salmon is a Christian. During his time with the Angels, he would lead weekly chapel services in the team&#x27;s clubhouse. Salmon has served as the head baseball coach at Scottsdale Christian Academy since 2015. He coached his son from 2015 to 2018.

<text>The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe is an encyclopedic guide which details the fictional universe featured in Marvel Comics publications. The original 15-volume series was published in comic book format in 1982, followed by sporadic updates.

==Origin==
Jim Shooter, Marvel&#x27;s then editor-in-chief, conceived the idea of envisioning a guide detailing statistics much in the manner of those found upon the back of baseball cards. This initial project was to be called &quot;The Marvel Super-Specifications Handbook&quot; (the eventual title incorporating the term &quot;Marvel Universe&quot; was appropriated from Al Milgrom, who used it as a working title for the anthology series &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot;). Shooter appointed Mark Gruenwald editor of the project, and Gruenwald developed the project to include all aspects of the Marvel Universe, although he noted it was not comprehensive. In addition to Gruenwald, contributing writers on the initial volume were Marvel editors Mike Carlin, Eliot R. Brown, and Peter Sanderson. Gruenwald brought in Josef Rubinstein to be the sole inker of the project because he felt Rubinstein was best able to make the characters easily recognizable and to subvert his own style to that of the handbook&#x27;s various pencillers.

Critics of the &quot;Handbook&quot; have argued that the level of detail within the guide effectively limited the ability of writers to innovate, a charge Gruenwald dismissed, reputedly stating that the information presented was only the most recent data and was subject to change. Sanderson, one of the writers of the original guide, noted that &quot;Mark sought to make the Marvel characters&#x27; super-powers as firm a basis in real science as possible. After the first version of the &quot;Handbook&quot;, Mark decided that some of the explanations had grown too complicated, and asked me to simplify them.&quot;

The &quot;OHOTMU&quot; detailed the more significant characters, items and locations in the Marvel Universe, itemizing them into individual entries. Individual entries usually consisted of:
* A frontal full-body view of the character.
* Prose text describing the character&#x27;s origin, powers, and other abilities and unique traits, as well as statistics such as their place of birth, former aliases, and physical features. The original edition opted only to describe the &quot;origins&quot; of characters (how they acquired their powers), instead focusing heavily on detailed explanations for how those powers functioned. In the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; supplement, however, the handbook provided entire &quot;histories&quot; for the deceased characters, a trend which was then adopted for the main body of the &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot;, allowing the entire life and career of the characters to be covered. Major important pieces of equipment were also given technical illustrations with breakdowns of their functions and features.
* Example images of the character in action, taken directly from the comics themselves.

In the original, characters were listed at one character to a page, although minor characters were sometimes listed at two to a page and major characters would occasionally receive more than one page. In the &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot;, every character received at least one page, with significant characters receiving up to 3-5 pages. Both editions had wraparound covers that could be linked together to form a giant poster. In the late 1980s, a poster made up of the first twelve issues of the original &quot;Handbook&quot; was released. For the poster, several characters were added and others received up-to-date looks.

In the &quot;Master Edition&quot; (1990–1993) this changed and every character was allocated a double-sided loose leaf page. Later versions allocate characters different lengths of entry depending on their history and importance.

==Publication history==
There have been several versions of the concept since it was first published in 1982:

* 1982-1984: a 15-issue series. Issues #13-14 are titled the &quot;Book of the Dead and Inactive&quot;, featuring characters and groups who were, at the time, believed dead or inactive. Issue #15 is titled the &quot;Book of Weapons, Hardware, and Paraphernalia&quot;, featuring technical drawings of equipment such as Captain America&#x27;s shield and Spider-Man&#x27;s web shooters. One issue of the series (#9) can be seen in the movie &quot;Explorers&quot;.
* 1985-1988: a 20-issue &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; is published; technical drawings of equipment are incorporated into individual characters&#x27; entries. Although numerous entries reference an Appendix, the Deluxe Edition Appendix is not published. This run was also collected in trade paperback format, in a series of 10 128-page volumes. The trade edition also feature updates of many characters. Supplements for licensed properties are published, including Conan the Barbarian, G.I. Joe, and the Transformers.
* 1989: An additional eight-issue supplement to the &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot;, denoted &quot;Update &#x27;89&quot; on the cover, is published. This series covers primarily new characters and is notable for including numerous non-superhumans. This series also sported wraparound covers but, unlike previous versions, these did not link together.
* 1990-1993: A 36-issue &quot;Master Edition&quot; series is published, with each issue a shrink-wrapped pack of loose-leaf pages. A three-ring vinyl binder was also released for the pages to be inserted into.
* 2004-2005: Themed one-shot supplements are published, such as &quot;Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe: X-Men 2004&quot;. Other entries in this themed, subtitled series include &quot;Spider-Man 2004&quot;; &quot;Avengers 2004&quot;; &quot;Hulk 2004&quot;; &quot;Daredevil 2004&quot;; &quot;Wolverine 2004&quot;; &quot;Golden Age 2004&quot;; &quot;Women of Marvel 2005&quot; and &quot;Avengers 2005&quot;.
* 2006: A new 12-issue series, the &quot;All-New OHOTMU A-Z&quot;, was published featuring new characters. A series of themed one-shot issues was also published in the same style as the 2004-2005 books, including &quot;Civil War Files&quot; which tied in with Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Civil War&quot; crossover series. The original &quot;Handbook&quot;, original 20-issue &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot;, and the &quot;Update &#x27;89&quot; edition were also reprinted in five &quot;Essential&quot; volumes.
* 2007: Four &quot;A-Z Update&quot; issues, six themed issues (including &quot;World War Hulk: Gamma Files&quot; and &quot;X-Men: Messiah Complex - Mutant Files&quot;) and the first issue of the &quot;Marvel Atlas&quot; are published.
* 2008: All material from 2004-2007 is updated and printed in the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Premiere HC&quot; set, divided into 14 volumes (each containing 240 pages). The second issue of the &quot;Marvel Atlas&quot; is published. Other publications included &quot;Ultimate Secrets&quot;, &quot;All-New Iron Manual&quot;, &quot;Secret Invasion: Skrulls!&quot;, and &quot;Amazing Spider-Man: Brand New Day Yearbook&quot;.
* 2009: The &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Premiere HC&quot; set continued publication. A sister project to the &quot;Handbook&quot;, the &quot;Official Index to the Marvel Universe&quot; monthly series, began publication in January. Other forthcoming titles include &quot;Dark Reign Files&quot; and &quot;Wolverine: Weapon X Files&quot;.

==Reception==
Lawrence Henry Apodaca reviewed the original &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer&quot; No. 64. Apodaca commented that &quot;Non-comic collectors should be able to find copies at stores which carry back issues - and should look for them. They are a valuable aid to science fiction or superhero RPGs.&quot;

<text>Empfindsamkeit () or Empfindsamer Stil is a style of musical composition and poetry developed in 18th-century Germany, intended to express &quot;true and natural&quot; feelings, and featuring sudden contrasts of mood. It was developed as a contrast to the Baroque &quot;Affektenlehre&quot; (doctrine of the affections), in which a composition (or movement) would have the same affect (e.g., emotion or musical mood) throughout.

==Etymology==
The German noun &quot;Empfindsamkeit&quot; is usually translated as &quot;sensibility&quot; (in the sense used by Jane Austen in her novel &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;), while the adjective &quot;empfindsam&quot; is sometimes rendered as &quot;sentimental&quot; or &quot;ultrasensitive&quot;. &quot;Empfindsamkeit&quot; is also sometimes translated, and may even be derived from the English word &quot;sentimentality&quot;, since it is related to the then-contemporary English literature sentimentality literary movement.

==History==
The &quot;empfindsamer Stil&quot; is similar to and often considered a dialect of the international &quot;galant&quot; style, which is marked by simple homophonic textures (a single, clear melody, supported by subordinate chordal accompaniment) and periodic melodic phrases. However, unlike the broader &quot;galant&quot; style, &quot;empfindsamer Stil&quot; tends to avoid lavish ornamentation.

The dramatic fluidity that was a goal of the &quot;empfindsamer Stil&quot; has encouraged historians to view mid-century &quot;Empfindsamkeit&quot; as a slightly earlier parallel to the showier and stormier phase called &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; (storm and stress) that emerged around 1770. These two trends are together regarded as &quot;pre-Romantic&quot; manifestations, because of their emphasis on features such as extreme expressive contrasts with disruptive incursions, instability of key, sudden changes of register, dynamic contrast, and exciting orchestral effects, all of which are atypical of musical classicism as practiced in the second half of the eighteenth century.

===In music===
The &quot;empfindsamer Stil&quot; is especially associated with the so-called Berlin School at the Prussian court of Frederick the Great. Traits characteristic for composers of this school are a particular fondness for Adagio movements and precise attention to ornaments and dynamics, as well as the liberal use of appoggiaturas (&quot;sigh&quot; figures) and frequent melodic and harmonic chromaticism.

Composers in this style include:
* Carl Friedrich Abel
* C. P. E. Bach, the second eldest son of J. S. Bach
* Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, the eldest son of J. S. Bach
* Georg Benda
* Anton Fils
* Carl Heinrich Graun
* Gottfried August Homilius
* Nicola Porpora
* Giovanni Alberto Ristori
* Giuseppe Tartini
* Johann Adolph Hasse
* Johann Gottlieb Janitsch
* Johann Joachim Quantz
* Johann Friedrich Reichardt
* Christoph Schaffrath
* Carlos Seixas
* Leonardo Leo

Poets in this style include:
* Salomon Gessner

<text>West Nova () is a federal electoral district in Nova Scotia, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1968.

South Western Nova and South West Nova were ridings that covered roughly the same geographic area and were represented in the House of Commons from 1968 to 1979 and 1979 to 1997, respectively.

The district is rural with a few small towns and communities located along the coast. The riding has been called a microcosm of rural Canada because it includes fishing, farming, tourism, small business and an English-French mix. 

==History==
The electoral district was created in 1966 from Digby—Annapolis—Kings and Shelburne—Yarmouth—Clare ridings. In 1996, Seal Island was added and the name was changed from South West Nova to West Nova. In 2004, 20 percent of Kings—Hants was added to the district. The boundaries remained unchanged as per the 2012 federal electoral redistribution. From 1968 until 2004, the Riding was notable for never having elected a single person to a second consecutive term until Robert Thibault won in 2004.

Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, this riding will be renamed Acadie—Annapolis. It will lose some territory (Berwick area) in Kings County to Kings—Hants.

<doc id="610249" wikidata="Q2538688" url="?curid=610249" title="Wade H. McCree">
<text>Wade Hampton McCree Jr. (July 3, 1920 – August 30, 1987) was an American legal scholar and judge. He was the first African American appointed as a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and the second African-American United States Solicitor General in the history of the United States. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan Law School after leaving government service in 1981, and taught there until the time of his death.

==Education and career==
McCree was born on July 3, 1920, in Des Moines, Iowa. He was the son of Wade Hampton McCree Sr., a graduate of Fisk University who had worked his way through college as a butler and who became the first African-American pharmacist and pharmacy owner in Iowa. McCree senior was later employed as first African-American narcotics inspector for the Food and Drug Administration. McCree grew up mainly in Boston, and attended the prestigious Boston Latin School. Like his father, McCree worked his way through Fisk University. He was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa society and graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1941 with an Artium Baccalaureus degree. After serving a four-year stint as a Captain in the United States Army during World War II, McCree entered Harvard Law School and graduated 12th in his class in 1948 with a Bachelor of Laws. McCree and his wife, Dores, a graduate of Simmons College, then moved to her hometown of Detroit, Michigan where they raised three children. McCree practiced law at the black law firm of Bledsoe &amp; Taylor from 1948 to 1952. He began his long career in public service in 1953 when was appointed to the Workman&#x27;s Compensation Commission by Michigan Governor G. Mennen Williams. Two years later McCree became the first African-American to be appointed to the Circuit Court for Wayne County, Michigan, and served on that court from 1954 to 1961.

==Federal judicial service==
McCree was nominated by President John F. Kennedy on September 18, 1961, to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, to a new seat authorized by 75 Stat. 80. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 23, 1961, and received his commission on September 29, 1961, becoming the first African-American on that court. His service terminated on September 13, 1966, due to elevation to the Sixth Circuit.

McCree was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson on August 16, 1966, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, to a new seat authorized by 80 Stat. 75. He was confirmed by the Senate on September 7, 1966, and received his commission on September 7, 1966, becoming the first African-American on that court. His service terminated on March 28, 1977, due to his resignation.

===Views on race===
While sitting on the federal bench, McCree was known to have expressed his views on race and justice. When a lawyer argued that McCree could not impartially decide a case involving a black and a white litigant, McCree replied that &quot;the ultimate of arrogance is achieved when a white person thinks another white person can make a judgment without being influenced by race, and a black person cannot.&quot;

==Friends School==
When his eldest daughter, Kathleen McCree Lewis, was refused admission to an all-girls school in Detroit because she was black, McCree founded the interracial Friends School in 1965. He was also a founder of the statewide Higher Education Opportunity Committee, a program which identifies promising middle school students and provides them with college scholarships.

==Solicitor General service==

McCree left the Sixth Circuit when President Jimmy Carter appointed him United States Solicitor General. As Solicitor General, McCree served as the head appellate lawyer for the United States Government and represented the administration in cases before the United States Supreme Court.

===Notable cases===
McCree personally argued 25 cases before the Supreme Court, including the Richard Nixon presidential tapes case and the &quot;Regents of the University of California v. Bakke&quot; affirmative action case. In &quot;Bakke&quot;, McCree argued that race could be one factor in deciding whether an applicant was admitted to medical school. He said at the time that he was &quot;in favor of special admissions programs, but people who can outgrow them should not become dependent on them.&quot; Called the &quot;10th Justice&quot; by virtue of his office, McCree served as Solicitor General for four years.

==Later career==
McCree resigned his commission as Solicitor General after the end of the Supreme Court&#x27;s Term in June 1981, after Republican President Ronald Reagan took office. Chief Justice Burger had privately signaled his preference that McCree not be replaced until the end of the Term. McCree then became the Lewis M. Simes Professor of Law at the University of Michigan, where he taught until his death. During these years he also consulted on various cases and served as Special Master for United States Supreme Court cases of original jurisdiction.

==Death==
McCree died on August 30, 1987, at age 67 of bone cancer and a heart ailment at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan. President Carter said at his memorial service that McCree was &quot;a true American hero&quot;. McCree is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery.

==Legacy==
McCree&#x27;s daughter, Kathleen McCree Lewis, was nominated by President Bill Clinton to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in 1999. However, the United States Senate failed to act on Lewis&#x27; nomination.

His son, Wade Harper McCree III, served as a 3rd Circuit Court judge in Wayne County, Michigan, from 2006 until May 2013. He was suspended without pay in May 2013 for multiple counts of misconduct. He was officially removed from office on March 26, 2014.

<text>Francis Williams Sargent (July 29, 1915 – October 22, 1998) was an American politician who served as the 64th governor of Massachusetts from 1969 to 1975. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the 63rd lieutenant governor of Massachusetts from 1967 to 1971. In 1969, he became acting governor when John A. Volpe resigned to become Secretary of Transportation under the Nixon Administration. In 1970, he was elected governor in his own right, defeating the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee Kevin White. He lost reelection in 1974 to Democrat Michael Dukakis, who would go on to be the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for President in 1988.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Sargent was born in 1915 in Hamilton, Massachusetts, the son of Margery (Lee) and Francis Williams Sargent. He was known for his sharp wit and self-deprecating manner. A Republican, &quot;Sarge&quot; graduated from Charles River School, and then Noble and Greenough School.

Sargent was a student in the architecture program (class of 1939) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a classmate and friend of architect I.M. Pei. Sargent received a special degree in architecture after completing four years of what was then a five-year program, rather than a normal graduation.

After MIT, Sargent worked for the architectural firm of Coolidge Shepley Bulfinch and Abbott as a draftsman, leaving to work as a carpenter for a general contractor to learn the building trade. He then started his own firm, Sargent &amp; Sweeney.

Sargent served in World War II, fighting in Italy, earned a Bronze Star, and a Purple Heart. He enlisted in 1942, volunteered for the ski troops, and rose from private to corporal to sergeant to lieutenant to captain while serving with the 10th Mountain Division in Italy.

After the war, Sargent moved with his family to Orleans on Cape Cod, where he and his son started and ran the Goose Hummock sporting goods store, beginning in 1946.

== Government and politics ==
Sargent served as the Director of Marine Fisheries for ten years, from 1947 to 1957. Between 1959 and 1962 he was in Washington, D.C., as the executive director of the U.S. Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission. He was appointed as the state Commissioner of Public Works in Massachusetts in 1964, a position he held for two years.

=== Elections ===
In 1962, Sargent ran for a seat in the Massachusetts state Senate, but lost.

In 1966, Sargent ran for and was elected as Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts with the slogan &quot;Put Sarge in Charge&quot;. In 1969, he became acting governor when Governor John A. Volpe (R) resigned to become secretary of Transportation under President Richard Nixon. In 1970, Sargent won the gubernatorial election in his own right, defeating Boston Mayor Kevin White.

According to a biography of Barney Frank, White was the first mayor to declare the city had a race problem, and people wanted to keep him as mayor instead of making him governor. Frank said, &quot;Sargent was seen as a good liberal and some liberals reasoned that if we elect Kevin White as governor, who knows who is going to be Mayor of Boston.&quot; Frank also said it was Sargent&#x27;s popularity that won him the election.

Sargent retired from politics after running for reelection and being defeated by Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 1974 gubernatorial election. Among the factors contributing to his defeat was voter distaste for the Watergate scandal, and an economic slowdown.

===Policies as governor===
When Sargent first entered office, the budget was in turmoil because of spending increases on welfare and other benefits. He tightened rules for qualifying for Medicaid and introduced a new corporate tax.

He was governor of the Commonwealth during the strife over school busing following Judge W. Arthur Garrity&#x27;s 1974 decision to desegregate Boston public schools through court-mandated redistricting of the Boston school system, including busing some students out of their neighborhoods to end a pattern of racial segregation in the schools. Sargent had previously vetoed attempts to repeal or water down the state&#x27;s Racial Imbalance Act, which prohibited state aid to racially imbalanced school districts. When Sargent called for obeying the federal court order, anti-busing forces complained that he and his neighbors in the well-to-do suburban Boston town of Dover, Massachusetts, did not have to share any of the burden of desegregating Boston schools.

Carl Sheridan, a former Dover police chief, said of the incident, &quot;I think people will most remember him for the busing situation. I remember one time a bus load of demonstrators came out to Dover looking for Sargent and his house. But because the town had no street lights, they got out of the bus and were standing in the pitch black. They got back in the bus and left. Sargent was still laughing about that two weeks ago.&quot;

Sargent also created the weekend prison furlough program. After the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that the right extended to first-degree murderers because the statute did not specifically exclude them, the Massachusetts legislature quickly passed a bill to prohibit furloughs for such inmates. However, in 1976, Michael Dukakis vetoed that bill.

Sargent also created the Massachusetts Appeals Court in 1972, and selected Alan M. Hale, then a justice of the Superior Court at the time, along with David Rose, Edmund Keville, Reuben Goodman, Donald Grant, and Christopher Armstrong, to the bench. They were sworn under oath in October 1972. Sargent said of the experience, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t too darn anxious to come here. I liked what I was doing. I enjoyed the experience on the Superior Court, meeting people and lawyers all over the State. I didn&#x27;t want to leave, but the challenge of setting up an entirely new court was one I could not refuse.&quot; Sargent went on to speak of Chief Justice Hale and his five associates, &quot;I have sought individuals who have a proven record of outstanding legal accomplishment, wisdom and good judgment. It is my belief that the men we have selected will allow this court to take its rightful place in our judicial system. It is a bench both balanced and responsive. It will, from the outset, be able to shoulder its full share of an appellate overload which for many years has been staggering.&quot; He called the creation of the Appeals Court &quot;the single most significant step in judicial reform in Massachusetts this century.&quot;

=== Cabinet ===

==Conservationist==
Sargent was an avid fisherman on Cape Cod and became interested in the environment because he was frustrated by overfishing and the use of illegal nets. A dedicated conservationist, he delivered the keynote address at MIT on the first Earth Day in 1970.

===Anti Inner Belt===
Sargent achieved renown among conservationists and advocates of a multi-modal urban transportation system by canceling most highway construction inside Route 128, with the exception of the Northern Expressway in 1970. Sargent became a strong advocate for changing the federal laws governing aid to states for highway construction so that more funds were available for mass transit projects such as subways and light-rail vehicles.

Frederick P. Salvucci, an engineer, said this of Sargent and the cancellation of the inner belt: Yes, of course. In many ways the most thrilling moment in the history of the antihighway fight was when we won. And then Governor Sargent went on television and said, basically, he had been the public works commissioner who had fought for the inner belt earlier in his career and, as governor he said it was a mistake and &quot;I&#x27;m going to admit that mistake and stop the program and we&#x27;re going to shift towards public transportation.&quot; I mean it was thrilling. It was thrilling for us that had worked hard on it, but also, in fairness to Sargent how often do you see a public official who gets up and says, &quot;I was wrong&quot;? I mean it was an incredibly courageous thing for Frank Sargent to do, and I&#x27;m a Democrat. I don&#x27;t say many good things about republicans. But he was a great man. I mean he had worked for this program. He always had an environmentalist bent to him. [A] lot of people do political analysis as to why he did this or that. I think he just believed what he said. &quot;This was a mistake and we&#x27;re going to go in a different direction.&quot; It was a thrilling moment in the history of it.

And then we actually moved in that new direction. I mean we shifted the funds, partly under Governor Sargent, partly under Governor Dukakis. Those monies that were going to go into destroying those neighborhoods or building the highways were shifted into refurbishing the commuter rail system, extending the Red Line, relocating the Orange Line, basically rebuilding the public transportation infrastructure of the city. That came out of that decision and another component of the same decision – you can go check that speech that Frank Sargent gave – was that the only highways that would continue to be studied within Route 128 would be the depression and widening of the Central Artery and the extension of I-90 over to Logan in an additional tunnel, the two components that are today called the Big Dig. Those were really part of that, if you will, anti-highway – &quot;anti-highway&#x27;s&quot; probably the wrong name – pro-city decision that was made by Frank Sargent to shift towards a transportation strategy that would build the city instead of destroying it.

And a major component of that was, stop building destructive roads. Another major component was, put a lot of money into improving public transportation, and the third component that we&#x27;re seeing built now is, take the existing Central Artery that&#x27;s there and fix it. I mean fix it both from a transportation point of view, because it doesn&#x27;t work, but also fix what it did to the city by it underground and knit the city back together again. That was a very thrilling moment in my life, when Sargent did it. And I&#x27;ve always respected him a great deal because of the courage that it took to do that.

Sargent also called in Alan A. Altshuler, a political science professor at MIT take a new look at where we were headed in transportation policy. Sargent made him Secretary of Transportation and he presided over the Boston Transportation Planning Review. This review basically led to the stopping of the inner belt and the southwest expressway. Frederick P. Salvucci called them &quot;two major very destructive interstate highways&quot;. But, the funds were reallocated towards public transportation, and saw the extension of the Red Line to Braintree and the relocation of the Orange Line.

== Later life ==
After Sargent was defeated in the election of 1974, he accepted an appointment as a senior lecturer at the Joint MIT-Harvard Center for Urban Studies. He also continued to own the Goose Hummock sporting goods store until 1986.

==Personal life==
Sargent married Jessie Fay Sargent in 1938. She wrote a memoir in 1973 about their time in office, entitled &quot;The Governor&#x27;s Wife: A View from Within&quot;. In 1969, she helped to launch the Doric Dame, a group of volunteers that led tours of the Massachusetts State House. They had a son, Francis W. &quot;Bill&quot; Sargent, Jr., and two daughters, Fay and Jessie (Jay).

In the Massachusetts general election of 1978, Sargent&#x27;s son was considered by the State Republican Committee to succeed William A. Casey as the Republican nominee for Massachusetts State Auditor after Casey dropped out to support Democrat Edward J. King in the Governor&#x27;s race. In 1996, Sargent&#x27;s son was a candidate for the United States House of Representatives seat in Massachusetts&#x27;s 10th congressional district in 1996. He lost the Republican nomination to Edward B. Teague III.

Sargent died on October 21, 1998, in Dover, Massachusetts. His wife Jessie died on August 15, 2008.

<text>The U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (USAF TPS) is the Air Force&#x27;s advanced flight training school that trains experimental test pilots, flight test engineers, and flight test navigators to carry out tests and evaluations of new aerospace weapon systems and also other aircraft of the U.S. Air Force. This school was established on 9 September 1944 as the Flight Test Training Unit at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB) in Dayton, Ohio. To take advantage of the uncongested skies, usually superb flying weather, and the lack of developed zones in the event of crashing, the test pilot school was officially moved to its present location at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert of Southern California on 4 February 1951.

The TPS was created to formalize and standardize test pilot training, reduce the high accident rate during the 1940s, and increase the number of productive test flights. In response to the increasing complexity of aircraft and their electronic systems, the school added training programs for flight test engineers and flight test navigators. Between 1962 and 1972, the test pilot school included astronaut training for armed forces test pilots, but these classes were dropped when the U.S. Air Force crewed spaceflight program was suspended. Class sizes have been uniformly quite small, with recent classes having about twenty students. The school is a component of the 412th Test Wing of the Air Force Materiel Command.

==Mission==
The USAF TPS aims to produce highly adaptive, critical-thinking flight test professionals to lead and conduct full-spectrum tests and evaluations of aerospace weapons, and to be the world&#x27;s premier educational and training center for theoretical and applied flight test engineering.

==Selection process==
* Admission into the USAF TPS is extremely competitive. Thousands of pilots apply. Not uncommonly, some students have been alternated two or three times before being accepted.
* Civilians are also permitted and encouraged to apply for the long-course program.
* Prospective students should provide AF Form 1711, USAF Test Pilot School Application, plus additional forms specific to a) USAF Pilot/Navigator, b) Experimental FTE, and c) Civilian applicant for the selection board.
* Experimental FTE and civilian applicants are required to undergo a flying Class III physical before facing the TPS selection board.
* Applications must be received by Special Flying Programs Section HQ AFPC/DPAOT3 no later than 45 days before the selection boards meet. UCCR selection boards are held once a year at the Headquarters of the Air Force Personnel Center. The boards are normally held in November, and the board selects the TPS two classes for the next year. At this point, AFIT-TPS students and students from foreign TPS schools are also selected. The USAF TPS commandant chairs the board. Board members consist of an HQ AFPC colonel, and at least a majority of the board members must be TPS graduates (majors or lieutenant colonels) who are standing flight test, squadron commanders. The AFMC/DO selects board members.

===Admission requirements===
All candidates require secret clearance. As of May 2015, the minimum admission requirements for application to the USAF TPS are:

* Grade point average is on a 4.0 scale.
* Air Force standards for flying duty are defined in Air Force Instruction 48-123, Chapter 6.
* Air Force Specialty Codes listed for engineers include:
** 13XX—Operations: Space, Missile, Command, and Control
** 14NX—Operations: Intelligence
** 21AX—Logistics: Aircraft Maintenance
** 21CX—Logistics: (not found)
** 21LX—Logistics: Logistician
** 21MX—Logistics: Munitions and Missile Maintenance
** 33SX—Support: Communications and Information
** 61SX—Acquisition: Scientist
** 62EX—Acquisition: Developmental Engineer
** 63AX—Acquisition: Acquisition Manager

===Exchange program===
From time to time, students are selected to attend different test pilot schools in an exchange program between test cultures. Toward this end, students can be sent to the Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, and vice versa. Also, the USAF Test Pilot School has an exchange program with the Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School at Boscombe Down, England, and the EPNER (École du Personnel Navigant d&#x27;Essais et de Réception), the French Test Pilot&#x27;s School.

===Course of study===
* The USAF TPS curriculum is designed to grant a Master of Science degree in flight test engineering through the Air Force&#x27;s Air University at the end of the 48-week course. Students are required to take all of the 20 offered courses to graduate. This is a total of 50 credit hours for the 48-week course. Each of the four phases are broken down into three or four main lecture courses, plus their associated flight laboratory work or flight simulator work, and actual practice flights. To graduate from the USAF TPS, a student must be in good standing and satisfactorily complete all academic tests, all oral and written reports, all of the required flight missions, and comprehensive pre-graduation written and oral evaluations with an overall GPA of 3.0 or better.
* Accreditation from the American Council of Education has been in effect since July 1974 (last updated in July 1998) to recommend selected coursework for transfer credit to other higher education institutions.
* At graduation, the commandant usually presents these awards:
** Liethen-Tittle Award to the experimental test pilot graduate with the best overall record for outstanding performance and academic excellence
** R.L. Jones Award to the outstanding experimental test navigator or experimental flight test engineer graduate with the best overall record for outstanding performance and academic excellence

==Curriculum==
* Two classes are held each year, 48 weeks each (long class). Students can apply for one of three tracks - experimental test pilot, flight test engineer, or flight test navigator. The upper class is called the senior class, while the lower class is called the juniors, determined by what point they are at in their studies at TPS. The class size at TPS varies. Over the past few years, over 20 TPS students have been in each class.
* The four main subdisciplines taught by the USAF TPS Education Division are 
** Performance
** Flying qualities
** Systems
** Test management
* TPS also offers short courses in these areas:
** Aerospace vehicle test course
** Unmanned aerial vehicle flight test engineering
** Electronic warfare flight test engineering
** Test management
** Equations of motion
** Propulsion
** Senior executive course
* Organization of the class uses this chain of command:
** Commandant—TPS commander
** Deputy commandant—TPS deputy commander
** Class leader— assigned by the front office based on seniority and academic curriculum to assist the student population
** Students
* Facilities include 
** Two fully functional control rooms
** RADAR and electro-optics labs
** Variable-stability in-flight simulator test aircraft or F-16 VISTA
** Student library
** About 100 airborne laboratories over the course of the academic year from Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 to Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit

==History==

===Early years===

Although the United States Armed Forces had been evaluating aircraft since Lt. Benny Foulois flew with Orville Wright in 1909, the designation of &quot;test pilot&quot; was not formally applied until a group of McCook Field pilots was assigned to a flight testing squadron at Wright Field during World War I. Test pilot selection was a seemingly indiscriminate process yielding a mix of experienced pilots who had volunteered for the task, flight instructors who were simply assigned to the job, and the occasional officer fresh from flying school. One of the latter, Lt. Donald Putt, who would later rise to the rank of lieutenant general, recalled:

Test pilot training was nearly as informal as the selection process with most material directed toward the aeronautical engineers who supervised the tests. Reports and texts of this time provided little guidance regarding how tests should be flown. The best training for test pilots came from practical experience gained while flying as observers and hangar-talk tutorials from other pilots. A test pilot was not expected to have a formal engineering background. He was simply to follow the instructions on the test card and fly the airplane appropriately. Setting the standard to overcome this condition were test pilots such as Jimmy Doolittle. While at McCook Field, Doolittle served as a test pilot, but was given leave to earn both Master of Science and doctoral degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Today, most test pilots have advanced degrees in engineering.

=== At Wright-Patterson AFB ===

Inspired by the RAF&#x27;s Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School, Colonel Ernest K. Warburton, chief of the Flight Test Section at Wright Field, set about changing the role and status of flight testing in the Army Air Forces. His goals for the flight test community were standardization and independence, which were later realized with the establishment of the Air Technical Command Flight Test Training unit on 9 September 1944 and the independent Flight Test Division in 1945. The AAF now had a formal program of study to train young pilots to become flight test professionals. Under the command of Major Ralph C. Hoewing, the Flight Test Training Unit&#x27;s curriculum included classroom sessions covering performance flight test theory and piloting techniques. The students then put theory into practice with performance evaluations on the AT-6 Texan trainer. Shortly after the first class graduated, the school was redesignated the Flight Section School Branch with an increased focus on academic theory. In 1945, the school moved to Vandalia Municipal Airport (now the Dayton International Airport), after which it was redesignated the Flight Performance School and placed under the command of Lt. Colonel John R. Muehlberg, who became the first to carry the title &quot;commandant&quot;. Under Muehlberg, who in 1944/45 had attended the second course at the newly established ETPS in England, the school increased its fleet with North American P-51 Mustangs, Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, and North American B-25 Mitchells and expanded the curriculum to include a separate four-month stability and control course in addition to the existing performance course. In 1946, the test pilot school was moved again to nearby Patterson Field and Colonel Albert Boyd was assigned as chief of the Flight Test Division. Col. Boyd profoundly influenced both the school and the character of its future AAF test pilots with his insistence on precision flying skills and discipline. A graduate of the school in 1946, Major Bob Cardenas, later summarized Col. Boyd&#x27;s influence:

===Heading west===

Frequent bad weather and increased air traffic congestion at Wright-Patterson often prevented students from completing their coursework on time. In addition, most USAAF airplanes were by then being manufactured and tested by contractors on the West Coast of the United States. For these and other reasons, Col. Boyd began the transfer of all flight test operations, including the test pilot school, to Muroc Army Air Field. next to Rogers Dry Lake in the desert of southern California. The school continued operations at Patterson Field, and 1947, had the first United States Air Force class and the first class to fly jets. The Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star would provide jet performance training at the school until 1954.
In 1949, this school was renamed the Air Material Command Experimental Test Pilot School, and the soon-to-be Brigadier General Boyd assumed command of Muroc Air Force Base. Boyd chose Major John Amman, an instructor at the school, to go to Muroc AFB, and implement the details of the school&#x27;s move westward. On 8 December 1949, Muroc AFB has renamed the Edwards Air Force Base in honor of Glen Edwards, TPS class 45, who was killed in the crash of the Northrop YB-49 Flying Wing bomber. Captain Edwards, who had recently earned a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from Princeton, typified the new breed of test pilot of which Cardenas had written — one who combined the talents of a highly skilled pilot with the technical expertise of an engineer. Amman completed his work and on 4 February 1951, the school was officially transferred to Edwards Air Force Base. The enormous dry lake bed, extremely long runways, and clear weather served the USAF and the school well, as aircraft performance continued to increase.

===Edwards Air Force Base===

The TPS was housed in an old weather-beaten wooden hangar along the flight line of what became known as South Base. Although the quarters were spartan, the weather was superb with only two flying days lost due to weather in the first seven months of operation. Taking advantage of the calm morning air, students started the day flying missions to collect test data. Afternoons were spent in the lecture hall, and evenings were devoted to reducing data from the day&#x27;s flights. Data reduction was dull and labor-intensive, requiring the student to transcribe information recorded on film or oscillograph paper and perform calculations by hand or slide rule. Once reduced, the data were woven into a report that summarized the test and the student&#x27;s conclusions. Some students were not prepared for the rigorous academics and had to be dropped from enrollment. This situation improved in 1953, when the school was moved out of Air Research and Development Command, which allowed the selection boards to draw from a much larger, USAF-wide, pool of applicants, rather than just the local test squadrons.

Although changes to the curriculum could be made quickly, the acquisition of aircraft for the school remained a perennial challenge for the school&#x27;s staff. The Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star arrived in 1953 and became a staple for the students over the next 23 years. More aircraft types were added during the 1950s, including the Republic F-84 Thunderjet, North American F-86 Sabre, North American F-100 Super Sabre, Martin B-57 Canberra, and Convair F-102 Delta Dagger — the school&#x27;s first delta-winged airplane. In 1955, the school was renamed the U.S. Air Force Flight Test Pilot School, and a year later, moved into its present location on the Main Base facility. This new building, built at a cost of $156,000, was the first and only structure designed specifically for the purposes of the school.
In 1956, the school chose an official emblem, featuring a slide rule in front of the silhouette of a climbing jet, and a motto, &quot;Scientia est Virtus&quot; — Latin for &quot;Knowledge is Power&quot;. The new logo emphasized the school&#x27;s role in preparing students with both the technical theory and flying skills indispensable for evaluating modern aircraft. The new logo also replaced the unofficial badge of Dr. Howland Owl, a character from the popular Pogo comic strip, that appeared on the noses of many of the school&#x27;s airplanes.

As the Air Force gradually developed an aerospace doctrine during this period, a small cadre began to establish the criteria for additional coursework aimed at qualifying TPS graduates for the tasks of an astronaut. On Oct. 12, 1961, the Test Pilot School has redesignated the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS), with the curriculum, expanded to a full year, divided into Phase I (Experimental Test Pilot Course) and Phase II (Aerospace Research Pilot Course).

Between 1962 and 1975, the test pilot school expanded its role to include astronaut training for armed forces test pilots. Thirty-seven TPS graduates were selected for the U.S. space program, and 26 earned astronaut&#x27;s wings by flying in the X-15, Gemini, Apollo, and Space Shuttle programs.

On 21 May 2009, a T-38 Talon from the test pilot school on a training flight crashed 12 miles north of Edwards AFB, killing the student pilot Major Mark Paul Graziano and severely injuring the student navigator Major Lee Vincent Jones. An accident investigation determined that the crash was caused when the aircraft&#x27;s rudder operating mechanism disconnected the flight controls from the rudder actuators and caused the rudder to deflect 30° to the left. This induced an uncontrollable yaw and a resulting roll, causing the aircraft to depart a controlled flight, a condition that is unrecoverable in the T-38. The report stated that contributing factors to the crash were a structural fatigue failure or a structural break in a critical component or bolt, and a maintenance error in which a nut or cotter pin did not properly secure a bolt connecting two critical components. Citing two historical cases of rudder failure, the report concluded that maintenance error was the more likely cause. The investigation concluded, &quot;insufficient supervisory oversight and a lack of discipline of the training process&quot; in the maintenance unit existed in relation to the mishap aircraft.
==Personnel==

===Commandants===

The commanding officer of the USAF test pilot school is better known by the title of the commandant. Although not an official prerequisite for the position, most commandants are themselves graduates of the test pilot school. , Colonel James Valpiani is the commandant of the school.

===Notable alumni===

TPS has produced many notable alumni, including astronauts, record-setting aviators, and senior Air Force leaders.

<doc id="610263" wikidata="Q6540823" url="?curid=610263" title="Young Liberals (UK)">
<text>Young Liberals is the youth and student organisation of the British Liberal Democrats. Membership is automatic for members of the Liberal Democrats aged under 30. It organises a number of Fringe events at the Liberal Democrat Conference, which is held twice each year.

Young Liberals exists to campaign on issues affecting young people and students, with branches across the UK. The organisation is run by young people and acts as a pressure group within the Liberal Democrats.

Social liberalism, economic liberalism, social justice, internationalism and pro-Europeanism are important components of the group&#x27;s political philosophy.

The constitution of the Liberal Democrats requires an affiliated youth and student wing. Accordingly, Young Liberals is a Specified Associated Organisation (SAO) of the party. It is granted voting rights on various Liberal Democrat committees, such as the Party&#x27;s Federal Board.

Young Liberals is affiliated to both the International Federation of Liberal and Radical Youth (IFLRY) and European Liberal Youth. Its predecessors include Liberal Youth, founded in 2008, and Liberal Democrat Youth &amp; Students, founded in 1990. The earliest organisations were the National League of Young Liberals (NLYL), founded in 1903 and the Union of Liberal Students (ULS), founded in 1920.

==Organisation and structure==

===Federal organisation===
The Young Liberals are a Federal organisation composed of three equal components:

* the Welsh Young Liberals in Wales,
* the Scottish Young Liberals in Scotland, and 
* the English Young Liberals in England.

This mirrors the Liberal Democrats own Federal Model, with each British nation possessing a corresponding &#x27;State Party&#x27;.

===Executive===

The Executive is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the Young Liberals, ensuring the organisation&#x27;s operations are compliant with its own and the Liberal Democrats constitution, ensuring that the organisation is compliant with all relevant laws, and maintaining affiliations, branch accreditation and electing representatives to outside bodies which the Young Liberals are given representation on.

Members of the Executive also have their own portfolios, which each officer being responsible for a certain area of the organisations operations. Members of the Executive, barring the LDCRE representative, are elected annually by the general membership. If a vacancy arises during the term of the Executive, it is filled either through a co-option process or a by-election.

====Honorary roles====
There is an Honorary President and six Honorary Vice-Presidents of the organisation, who are elected by the membership to work alongside the executive to support the organisation, advise and often act as a form of institutional memory as well as give the Executive guidance and to act as spokespeople within the wider party.

===Committees===

In addition to the Executive, there are seven committees that are responsible for the administration, direction and implementation of policy and strategy corresponding to their area. These committees have a membership consisting of the relevant Federal Officers, representatives of the three states, and directly elected members who are elected alongside the Federal Executive every year. The State representatives are also elected by the memberships of the state organisations - English Young Liberals, Scottish Young Liberals and Welsh Young Liberals.

The current committees are Finance and Resources Committee, Elections Committee, Communications and Campaigns Committee, Events Committee, Policy Committee, International Committee, and Diversity Committee.

===Branches===

Young Liberals Branches are organised under regions and nations. They are small scale local groups often centering on a particular university, or local Liberal Democrat Party. Branches provide an opportunity for Young Liberals to socialise, network and campaign on a local level. There are over 30 active Branches across Great Britain including the Cambridge University Liberal Association and Oxford Students Liberal Association

==History==
The Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) each had their own separate student and youth wings, including the Young Liberals and the Young Social Democrats. In 1988, the Liberal Party and the SDP merged to form the Liberal Democrats.

Within England, the National League of Young Liberals merged with the Young Social Democrats to form Young Liberal Democrats of England. Additionally the Union of Liberal Students merged with the Students for Social Democracy to form the Student Liberal Democrats. Within Scotland, a separate organ was formed from the Scottish Liberal Students, the Scottish Young Liberal Democrats, which also included students of all ages.

Liberal Democrat Youth and Students (LDYS) was created in 1993 from the merger of the Student Liberal Democrats and the Young Liberal Democrats of England who had shared many resources in the run-up. The merger talks were overseen by a committee which included Sarah Gurling. LDYS reorganised into a federal structure in 2000 and then admitted Scottish Young Liberal Democrats as its Scottish federal unit in 2002—forming a single Britain-wide organisation for the first time since the combined ULS-NLYL committees of the 1970s.

Spring 2008 saw LDYS renamed as Liberal Youth, at an event hosted by the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg. It was then later renamed The Young Liberals in 2016, the organisation has established a &#x27;Liberal Youth Tax&#x27; where it asks older members who mistakenly refer to YL as the Liberal Youth to donate to the organisation 

Alumni of the Young Liberals include Former Prime Minister Liz Truss, former MP and leader of the Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson and current MP Sarah Green

==Conferences==

The federal Conference is the sovereign body of the Young Liberals and has power to determine policy and direction. The federal Young Liberals usually hosts two conferences a year, a conference in the Winter and a training weekend known as &#x27;Activate&#x27; in the Summer, which also acts as the constitutionally mandated Annual General Meeting. At conferences policy motions which shape YL policy and amendments to the organisations constitution are debated, alongside training and speaker sessions.

In addition, during each conference there is an Executive Scrutiny session, whereby members of the executive submit reports to conference on their activities and actions in their job. After each report motions on officers are debated, wherein any member can submit a Motion of commendation, Motion of censure or Motion of no confidence in an officer. Motions of commendation and censure are non-binding opinions of conference passed by a simple majority, expressing either positive or negative opinion on the actions of an officer. Motions of no confidence are binding motions which if passed have the effect of removing an officer from their position and require a two thirds majority in order to pass.

All Conferences following Manchester 2021, the first in person conference following the COVID-19 pandemic, are held as hybrid conferences. Hybrid conferences allow members to join in debates via Confera, an in-house developed and bespoke software package (and mobile app) which allows hybrid participation and voting in democratic events.

===Conference locations===
===Special Conferences===
In addition to the two ordinary Conferences, the Young Liberals may also hold additional &quot;Special Conferences&quot;. The Special Conferences require a requisition submitted to the Young Liberals Federal Executive signed by 40 full members, including at least 4 members of each State Organisation. The Special Conferences debates business specified in the requisition, although additional business may be taken at the discretion of the Executive.

The threshold of a Special Conference used to be significantly higher, standing at 200 members, however with the success of Online Conferences it was lowered as they could be held online with ease.

<text>Matthew Duncan McDaniel is an American indigenous rights activist from Oregon. McDaniel is a former carpenter working to improve human rights for the Akha people of Thailand and Laos. He is the founder of the Akha Heritage Foundation. He lived in Thailand from 1991 to 2004.

==Background==
On April 18, 2004, McDaniel was arrested at Thailand&#x27;s border with Burma by Thai immigration authorities, jailed for nine days, and then deported. In July 2005 he moved from the USA back to Laos. His Thai Akha wife and children left Thailand and went to Laos to be with him. After his wife and children received visas, the family relocated to the United States in May 2006. A December 22, 2005 &quot;Keizertimes&quot; article reported on the difficulty in getting the visas.

McDaniel is opposed to what he claims are missionary efforts to rewrite Akha history and eradicate their culture. This includes a language and oral history, which he says are critical components to their unique identity. He opposes coercive missionary conversion tactics, and the removal of Akha children from their families and villages. He has frequently questioned why charities such as Rotary International support certain missionary groups. McDaniel has asserted that Rotary International has since pulled their web pages supporting the funding of the Children of the Golden Triangle Mission. McDaniel also asserted that UNESCO was working with US missionaries who were &quot;destroying Akha culture&quot;.

A May 15, 2004 &quot;Asia Times&quot; article reported:

McDaniel estimates that more than 100 organizations are proselytizing. &quot;There&#x27;s way too many missionaries coming. It&#x27;s become a free-for-all. They come in with money from their home churches, with four-wheel drives, living like kings, like they never would back home,&quot; said McDaniel, whose forthright campaign upset many people, spurring whispers about his motives. McDaniel was reportedly deported by Thai authorities after being interviewed for this article; the reasons for the deportation are unclear.

A January 2003 &quot;Village Voice&quot; article described him as &quot;the evangelicals&#x27; fiercest critic in Chiang Rai.&quot;

Since moving to Thailand 15 years ago, McDaniel has started a small nongovernmental organization called the Akha Heritage Foundation. With an annual budget of $6000, the group provides services that range from the establishing of fish farms and publishing books in the Akha language to documenting human rights violations.
&quot;Half Moon Bay Review&quot; reported in a May 2009 article:
Bruno, a San Francisco resident, teamed up with McDaniel on what she calls &quot;guerilla aid style&quot; missions to usher medical supplies across the Thai-Burmese border to Akha people. Both were fighting a common enemy – exploitation and oppression – one with a knapsack full of medicine, the other with a video camera. She remembers watching McDaniel motorbike across the border alongside black market traders and sex traffickers, wearing a leather cowboy hat and shouldering a knapsack packed with bandages and ointments for homeless Akha.

== Motivations ==
The following is from an interview with Matthew McDaniel reported in the November 12, 2007 edition of the &quot;Statesman Journal&quot;:

== Drug war ==
McDaniel accuses the &quot;US Drug War&quot; and the UN Office of Drugs and Crime for helping cause the arrest, forced dislocation, prosecution, starvation, death and extrajudicial killings of Akha people in Thailand and Laos. McDaniel has filed reports with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and the International Criminal Court.

He documented extrajudicial killings during the anti-drugs push of Thailand&#x27;s prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2003.

For example, Matthew McDaniel and three of his associates (Itaru Furuta, Katharine Ricke, and Lisa Friedland) documented the June 20, 2003 killing of Leeh Huuh. McDaniel reported:

TODAY. Two days ago Leeh Huuh, other son of Ah Nah Burh Chay and Loh Pah Ah Sauh were called to the Phrao police station. The police left a notice with Loh Pah&#x27;s wife which she had to sign. TODAY at 8am these two men left for the police station. They were ambushed on the road and shot to death. We saw the bodies which we photographed. Police at Phrao police station denied knowledge of the details of the case that we already knew.
The first photo below is of Leeh Huuh and his wife in 2002. The next three photos are of Leeh Huuh&#x27;s body on June 20, 2003. The last photo is of two Akha wives whose husbands had been killed earlier the same day. Leeh Huuh&#x27;s wife is on the right side. Matthew McDaniel took the photos.

Thailand&#x27;s English-language newspaper &quot;The Nation&quot; reported on the drug war in November 2007:

Of 2,500 deaths in the government&#x27;s war on drugs in 2003, a fact-finding panel has found that more than half were not involved in drugs at all. At a brainstorming session, a representative from the Office of Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) Tuesday disclosed that as many as 1,400 people were killed and labeled as drug suspects despite the fact that they had no link to drugs.

Prosecutor Kunlapon Ponlawan said &quot;it was not difficult to investigate extra-judicial killings carried out by police officers as the trigger-pullers usually confessed.&quot;

The January 24, 2008 edition of &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that

over half of those killed in 2003 had no links to the drugs trade. The panel blamed the violence on a government &#x27;shoot-to-kill&#x27; policy based on flawed blacklists. But far from leading to the prosecutions of those involved, its findings have been buried. The outgoing interim prime minister, Surayud Chulanont, took office vowing to right Mr Thaksin&#x27;s wrongs. Yet this week he said there was insufficient evidence to take legal action over the killings. It is easy to see why the tide has turned. Sunai Phasuk, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, a lobbying group, says that the panel&#x27;s original report named the politicians who egged on the gunmen. But after the PPP won last month&#x27;s elections, those names were omitted.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on April 8, 2003:

Since the death of 9-year-old Chakraphan, there have been frequent reports in the Thai press of summary executions and their innocent victims. There was the 16-month-old girl who was shot dead along with her mother, Raiwan Khwanthongyen. There was the pregnant woman, Daranee Tasanawadee, who was killed in front of her two young sons. There was the 8-year-old boy, Jirasak Unthong, who was the only witness to the killing of his parents as they headed home from a temple fair. There was Suwit Baison, 23, a cameraman for a local television station, who fell to his knees in tears in front of Mr. Thaksin and begged for an investigation into the killing of his parents. His stepfather had once been arrested for smoking marijuana, Mr. Suwit said. When the police offered to drop the charge if he would admit to using methamphetamines, he opted instead to pay the $100 fine for marijuana use. Both parents were shot dead as they returned home from the police station on a motorbike. Mr. Suwit said 10 other people in his neighborhood had also been killed after surrendering to the police.
On March 4, 2008 the &quot;Asia Sentinel&quot; reported:

The first war on drugs, as it was known, pretty much evolved into a war on anybody the police decided to shoot. Under former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, more than 2,800 people were killed over a three-month period five years ago —about twice the normal murder rate of about 500 per month. Appointed Premier Surayud Chulanont half-heartedly set up a commission to investigate the drugs war nearly a year after the coup, but it had the effect of absolving the Thaksin administration. The committee found that about 1,370 of those deaths were related to drugs, while 878 were not. Another 571 people were killed for no apparent reason, according to the panel, and police investigated just 80 of those cases.

== United Nations ==

On May 18, 2006 Matthew McDaniel and his Akha wife, Michu Uaiyue, presented a statement at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. The full Michu Uaiyue statement (translated by Matthew McDaniel) is here: 

From the description page for the May 26, 2006 United Nations satellite television feed is this info about the statement:

== Horseback ride across USA ==

A November 30, 2007 &quot;Keizertimes&quot; article reported that Matthew McDaniel would ride by horseback across the USA to raise awareness of the Akha. The article reported: &quot;He plans to start his journey in Lincoln City, making his way to Los Angeles and New Orleans before finally ending up at the United Nations headquarters in New York City. All told he plans to travel some 4,500 miles. He said the ride could take seven months or more.&quot;

Here follows a quote from a November 30, 2007 &quot;Salem Monthly&quot; article (in Salem, Oregon):

The effort is &quot;a commitment to the Akha people to protect their lands, to send a message to the Thai government that the Queen of Thailand needs to give back the land of the Akha, to raise public awareness and end the removal of children from their villages and families by missionaries,&quot; he said.

The McDaniel family&#x27;s &quot;Ride for Freedom&quot; via horseback and bus began in Oregon March 6, 2009. On riding days McDaniel rode the horse, Hampton. He then hitchhiked back to a large touring-size bus where his family was located. There were found his Akha wife, Michu Uaiyue, and their 5 children aged 8 to 2. McDaniel then drove the bus to the horse. Then when ready he rode the horse another day. By May 5, 2009 the family had arrived in Half Moon Bay, California (20 miles south of San Francisco).

Hampton the horse is 17.2 hands high and eats 20 pounds of feed a day. A daily ride was around 20 to 25 miles, although they did 60 miles one day. McDaniel mapped the route with his iPhone. Concerning Hampton, he stated: &quot;You have to make a deal with a horse. You can&#x27;t fake it.&quot;

A May 13, 2009 &quot;Santa Cruz Sentinel&quot; article reported that McDaniel&#x27;s web site included a journal of the trip. The article also stated:
Using her husband as a translator, Michu declares: &quot;Until the queen gives our land back, people should keep talking about this.&quot;
The Akha Heritage Foundation web site links to McDaniel&#x27;s official YouTube channel that has many videos of the ride. On day 300 (Dec. 30, 2009) McDaniel was in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and had Hampton&#x27;s horseshoes replaced again.

On day 382 (Monday, March 22, 2010) McDaniel arrived in New York City. The &quot;Keizertimes&quot; reported: &quot;By noon he had hit Times Square, Rockefeller Center, the United Nations and finally Central Park, where he had arranged for someone to pick up him and his horse for a respite in rural New Jersey.&quot;

The next step is the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in New York City in April 2010.

<text>Esteban Enrique Bellán (; October 1, 1849 – August 8, 1932), was a Cuban professional baseball third baseman, shortstop, center fielder and manager. He is credited as the first Latin-American individual to play professional baseball in the United States, for six seasons: three in the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) from 1868 to 1870, and three in the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (also known simply as the National Association, or NA), from 1871 to 1873.

The Havana-born Bellán studied at the first and second divisions of St. John&#x27;s College in the Bronx (the modern Fordham Preparatory School and Fordham University, respectively) from 1863 to 1868. It was during his Fordham years that he acquired the English diminutive &quot;Steve&quot; that would follow him throughout his professional career in the United States. Arriving at Fordham, Esteban joined the Second Division baseball team, the Live Oaks, possibly having been exposed to the game back home in Cuba by American sailors.

After graduating from St. John&#x27;s in 1868, Bellán played one season for the Union of Morrisania, a member of the NABBP, and was part of their national championship team in 1868. He joined the Troy Haymakers in , and continued playing for the team when they joined the NAPBBP when it was formed in 1871 to replace the NABBP ceased operations.

Bellán left the Mutuals in 1873 and returned to Cuba to play in their newly formed baseball leagues. In what is often cited as the first organized baseball game ever played in Cuba, his Club Habana defeated Club Matanzas 51–9 on December 27, 1874. He later became the club&#x27;s player-manager, from 1878 to 1886, and led them to three Cuban League championships. He has been called &quot;The Father of Cuban Baseball&quot; for his role organizing the first Cuban baseball game, his success as a player and manager, and his continued influence on the game after his career had ended.

==Early life==
Born as Esteban Enrique Bellán on October 1, 1849 in Havana, Cuba to a wealthy Cuban father and an immigrant Irish woman. He was sent, along with his brother, to The Bronx in 1863 to study at St. John&#x27;s College, known today as Fordham Preparatory School and Fordham University, which was common among Cuba&#x27;s wealthy Catholic families. Having been exposed to the game in Cuba by American sailors, he soon joined the school&#x27;s baseball teams: first, during his Fordham Prep years, the Second Division Live Oaks, and then, as a college student, &quot;Fordham Rose Hill Baseball Club&quot;.

After graduating in 1868, at the age of 18, he joined the Union of Morrisania, a member of the NABBP that was based in The Bronx, today a part of New York City. He played in one season for the Unions, and helped them claim the national championship for the 1868 season.

==Professional career==
Nicknamed &quot;The Cuban Sylph&quot; for his elegant and stylistic play as a third baseman, Bellán joined the Troy Haymakers in 1869, while the team was member of the NABBP and still an amateur team. to 1872 for the Troy Haymakers. He played with the Haymakers through the 1869 and 1870 seasons when professionalism was officially permitted. The Haymakers then became a charter member of the NAPBBP in 1871, and Bellán played in all 29 of their games, 28 of them at third base, and one at shortstop. In 128 at bats, he collected 32 hits, hit three doubles, three triples, scored 26 runs, and had a .250 batting average. His nine bases on balls that season placed him eighth among the league leaders.

In 1872, Bellán played in 23 of the 25 games that the Haymakers games, while appearing at third base, shortstop, and in center field. He collected 30 hits, with four doubles, and had a .261 batting average. After the 1872 season, the Haymakers folded, and Bellán signed with the New York Mutuals for the 1873 season. He played eight games for the Mutuals, splitting his time at third and second base. His career statistics for his NAPBBP career include: a batting average of .252, 69 hits, 52 runs scored, 42 RBIs, nine doubles, three triples, and five stolen bases in 60 games.

==Cuba==
From 1878 to 1886 Bellán served as both player and manager for the recently founded Havana baseball team. His is recognized by many to be the true &quot;father&quot; of Cuban baseball for his role in organizing the first baseball game in Cuba on December 27, 1874. In that game, Club Habana defeated Club Matanzas, 51–9, in nine innings, with Bellán hitting three home runs. Bellán piloted Habana to three Cuban League baseball championships (1878–79, 1879–80, and 1882–83).

Esteban &quot;Steve&quot; Bellán died on August 8, 1932, at the age of 82, in Havana, Cuba.

He was inducted by the Fordham University Hall of Fame, 1989-90 and is also a member of Fordham Prep&#x27;s Hall of Honor.

<doc id="610283" wikidata="Q7090981" url="?curid=610283" title="On First Looking into Chapman's Homer">
<text>&quot;On First Looking into Chapman&#x27;s Homer&quot; is a sonnet written by the English Romantic poet John Keats (1795–1821) in October 1816. It tells of the author&#x27;s astonishment while reading a translation of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; by Elizabethan playwright George Chapman.
The poem has become an often-quoted classic that is cited to demonstrate the emotional power of a great work of art and the ability of great art to create an epiphany in its beholder.

==Background information==
Keats&#x27;s generation was familiar enough with the polished literary translations of John Dryden and Alexander Pope, which gave Homer an urbane gloss similar to Virgil but was expressed in blank verse or heroic couplets. Charles Cowden Clarke and John Keats both had a scrappy awareness of Pope’s translation and the most famous passages of Homer. Chapman&#x27;s vigorous and earthy paraphrase (1616) was put before Keats by Clarke, a friend from his days as a pupil at a boarding school in Enfield Town who was integral in Keats’s poetic education.

Charles Cowden Clarke had been lent a copy of Chapman’s Homer that was circulating around friends of Leigh Hunt, co-founder and editor of &quot;The Examiner&quot;. They sat up together till daylight to read it: &quot;Keats shouting with delight as some passage of especial energy struck his imagination. At ten o&#x27;clock the next morning, Mr. Clarke found the sonnet on his breakfast-table.&quot;

The poem was first published in &quot;The Examiner&quot; on 1 December 1816. It was later published in a collection called &quot;Poems&quot; in 1817.

==Poem==


==Analysis==
The &quot;realms of gold&quot; in the opening line seem to imply worldly riches until the name of Homer appears, then they are recognised as literary and cultural realms. The gold in this case refers to the intellectual and emotional rewards of literature. Of the many deities worshipped in the cultures of the Aegean, the god to whom the bards owe the most in fealty is Apollo, the leader of the inspiring Muses and Greek god of poetry and music. The Western islands is a reference to the Western Canon. Delos is the sacred island that was Apollo&#x27;s birthplace.

The second quatrain introduces &quot;one wide expanse&quot; that was ruled by Homer, but Keats had only “been told” of it as he could not read the original Greek (most cultured Englishmen of the time were only familiar with Latin). The &quot;wide expanse&quot; might have been a horizon of land or sea, but in Keats&#x27;s ”pure serene”, it is sensed as encompassing the whole atmosphere. Chapman&#x27;s voice then rings out. This sense of fresh discovery brings the reader to the volta: &quot;Then felt I...&quot;.

The reference to a &quot;new planet&quot; would have been important to Keats’s contemporary readers because of the recent discovery of Uranus with a telescope in 1781 by William Herschel, Court Astronomer to George III. News of Herschel&#x27;s discovery was sensational, as it was the first &quot;new&quot; planet to be discovered since antiquity.

Herschel was not the first person to have seen Uranus, but he was the person to have it recognised by the world as a planet. Keats may have read about Herschel’s discovery in the last chapter of a book he won while at Enfield Academy, an Introduction to Astronomy by Johnny Bonnycastle (published 1807). The author compares reading Homer&#x27;s poetry through Chapman&#x27;s translation to discovering a new world through a telescope. The translation helps Keats appreciate the significance of Homer&#x27;s poetry. Through Chapman&#x27;s translation, Homer&#x27;s preservation of the ancient Greek world comes to life with patience and perseverance in reading. Keats was thrilled by the gift of discovery, similar to Herschel.

Members of Vasco Núñez de Balboa&#x27;s expedition were the first Europeans to see the eastern shore of the Pacific (1513), but Keats chose to use Hernán Cortés. &quot;Darien&quot; refers to Darién Province, in Panama. Keats had read William Robertson&#x27;s &quot;History of America&quot; as a library book from Enfield Academy, and apparently conflated two scenes that it describes: Balboa&#x27;s view of the Pacific and Cortés&#x27;s first view of the Valley of Mexico (1519).

The Balboa passage: &quot;At length the Indians assured them, that from the top of the next mountain they should discover the ocean which was the object of their wishes. When, with infinite toil, they had climbed up the greater part of the steep ascent, Balboa commanded his men to halt, and advanced alone to the summit, that he might be the first who should enjoy a spectacle which he had so long desired. As soon as he beheld the South Sea stretching in endless prospect below him, he fell on his knees, and lifting up his hands to Heaven, returned thanks to God, who had conducted him to a discovery so beneficial to his country, and so honourable to himself. His followers, observing his transports of joy, rushed forward to join in his wonder, exultation, and gratitude&quot; (Vol. III).

In retrospect, Keats&#x27;s use of Cortés rather than Balboa as the person to introduce the Pacific Ocean to the wider world may have been serendipitously insightful. This is because the first translation of Homer into English was done by Arthur Hall in 1581. However, Hall’s translation, while earlier, like Balboa’s sighting of the Pacific that was earlier than Cortés’s, did not have as renowned and impactful a reception as Chapman’s later translation did.

Before Cortés&#x27;s 1519–21 conquest of the Aztec Empire, Cortés had been a colonist, administrator and conquistador in Hispaniola (from 1504) and Cuba (from 1511). Cortés never traveled to Darién but may have seen the Pacific after his conquest of the Aztec Empire or during his 1524–1526 visit to Honduras. Later during his governorship of Mexico, Cortés was a major explorer of the Pacific coast of Mexico and Baja California.

Since Cortés was never in Darién, Keats made a historical error. The standard critical view is that Keats simply remembered the grand but separate images of Cortés and of Darien, rather than their historical contexts. In retrospect, Keats&#x27;s historical error does not diminish from the poem’s literary impact, and likewise suggests that Chapman’s inaccuracies (Chapman gets details wrong, adds entire lines and has his own interpretation) do not diminish the poetic impact of Chapman’s Homer.

Homer&#x27;s &quot;pure serene&quot; has prepared the reader for the &quot;Pacific&quot; and so the analogy now expressed in the simile that identifies the wide expanse of Homer&#x27;s demesne with the vast Pacific, which stuns its discoverers into silence, is felt to be the more just.

The Pacific is the largest and deepest ocean on Earth. It represents a vast and deep new frontier that has an all-encompassing influence on the islands (Homer is the original influence for other poets) and facilitates connection and cultural exchange between communities. Cortés wonders at the ocean’s significance and beauty, and his understanding of the world is transformed by contemplating the encounter.

Keats felt amazed by the beauty and meaning of Homer’s poetry when he read Chapman&#x27;s translation. He compared it to discovering the Pacific, due to its vastness (large cast of characters in a 10-year war who span the emotional palette), depth (in the sense that literature rewards close reading, in the depth of motivations and emotions, the depth to which the themes of mortality, destiny, morality, identity inform the human condition), and Homer&#x27;s influence as the first and greatest written poet in the Western Canon. He enjoyed (particularly with Clarke, with whom the poem was first commemorated before being extended to the public) how poetry can connect people in shared wonder and contemplation.

Keats’s poetry engages the old (Uranus, the Pacific, Homer) with new eyes and fresh appreciation. It is filled with a sense of wonder, inspiration, joy, excitement, adventure and possibility at discovering the amazing made accessible (in Herschel’s and Cortés’s findings, Chapman’s English). This expands one’s horizons with life’s mysteries (the nature of free will, whether Homer was a group or a person, whether the Trojan war is historical fact), beauty (in expressiveness, relatable characters and timeless themes) and grandeur (as epic mythology, preserving Greek values and ideals of the good life).

Before the poem was published, Keats altered &quot;wondr&#x27;ing eyes&quot; (in the original manuscript) to &quot;eagle eyes&quot; and &quot;Yet could I never judge what Men could mean&quot; (which was the seventh line even in the first publication in &quot;The Examiner&quot;) to &quot;Yet did I never breathe its pure serene&quot;.

==Structure==
This poem is a Petrarchan sonnet, also known as an Italian sonnet. It is divided into an octave (the first 8 lines introducing the problem of not reading Homer) and a sestet (the last 6 lines introducing the solution of Chapman’s translation and how it makes Keats feel). It follows a rhyme scheme of ABBAABBACDCDCD. After the main idea has been introduced and the image played upon in the octave, the poem undergoes a volta (here “Then felt I…”), a change in the persona&#x27;s train of thought. The octave offers the poet as a literary explorer, but the volta brings in the discovery of Chapman&#x27;s Homer, the subject of which is further expanded through the use of imagery and comparisons which convey the poet&#x27;s sense of awe at the discovery.

As is typical of sonnets in English, the metre is iambic pentameter though not all of the lines scan perfectly (line 12 has an extra syllable, for example).

Besides, even if it was Balboa, the Pacific was open to being stared at about that time, and I see no reason why Cortez should not have had a look at it as well.&quot;
* In the P. G. Wodehouse novel &quot;The Inimitable Jeeves&quot;, Bertie Wooster states that his cousins &quot;looked at each other, like those chappies in the poem, with a wild surmise.&quot;

Wodehouse novel &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot;, when Bertie Wooster finds himself suddenly engaged, he states that he stood frozen, &quot;eyes bulging like those of the fellows I&#x27;ve heard Jeeves mention, who looked at each other with a wild surmise, silent upon a peak in Darien.&quot;
* In the P.G. Wodehouse novel &quot;Uncle Fred in the Springtime&quot;, Claude Pott&#x27;s first encounter with Lord Bosham is described thus: &quot;For a long instant he stood staring silently at Lord Bosham with the same undisguised interest which stout Cortez had once displayed when inspecting the Pacific. It is scarcely exaggerating to say that Mr Pott was feeling as if a new planet had swum into his ken.&quot;
* The first chapter of Arthur Ransome&#x27;s &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; is titled &quot;A Peak in Darien&quot; and is headed with the last four lines of the sonnet.

The addition of a comma in Keats&#x27;s title provides an indispensable pun—a clue to the reader about the subject of the pastiche.

<doc id="610286" wikidata="Q3141387" url="?curid=610286" title="Houston Antwine">
<text>Houston J. &quot;Twine&quot; Antwine (April 11, 1939 – December 26, 2011) was an American football defensive tackle who played in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons.

==Early life==
Antwine was born on April 11, 1939, in Louise, Mississippi. He attended Manassas High School in Memphis, Tennessee.

He played college football as a two-way lineman and wrestled for the Southern Illinois University Salukis. He was named a Little All-American for football, and finished as second in the NAIA heavyweight division in wrestling. Antwine was selected by his football teammates as team MVP in 1960. That season, the Salukis won the Interstate Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. He was inducted into the Southern Illinois University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1979.

==Pro career==
He was selected by the AFL&#x27;s Houston Oilers in the 1961 draft, but he was traded to the Boston Patriots for a fourth-round 1962 AFL draft pick. The Detroit Lions also drafted him in the third round of the 1961 NFL draft. Antwine chose to play for the Patriots. He did not play regularly in his first two seasons, starting only two games. 

He earned his first of six straight All-Star selections in 1963, a season in which Antwine was also named first team All AFL by the AFL, the Associated Press (AP), United Press International (UPI), and the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA). The Patriots tied for the best record in the East Division at 7–6–1. The Patriots won the Divisional Playoff game versus Buffalo before losing to the San Diego Chargers in the AFL Championship Game. It was the only playoff experience for Antwine.

Nicknamed &quot;Twine&quot; from his wrestling days, Antwine was cited by Pro Football Hall of Famer Billy Shaw as one of the American Football League&#x27;s best pass rushers, athletic and very quick on his feet, usually drawing double-team blocking for a line that also featured &quot;Earthquake&quot; Jim Lee Hunt. The Pro Football Hall of Fame states Antwine became &quot;one of the most dominant defensive players in league history especially noted as devastating against the run.&quot; Teammate Gino Cappelletti described Antwine with quickness akin to a cat, who could rush with his speed and technique. He returned his only interception as a player (for two yards) in a 28–20 win over the Denver Broncos on December 12, 1965.

Antwine was the AFL Defensive Player of the Week as he sacked Dan Darragh three times in the Patriots&#x27; 16–7 win over the Buffalo Bills at War Memorial Stadium on September 8, 1968. He had a career high in sacks that year with 7.5. He posted a career high ten tackles in the Patriots&#x27; 33–14 win over the Cincinnati Bengals at Fenway Park on December 1, 1968. He was traded in 1972 to the Philadelphia Eagles for Bill Hobbs and started nine games in his final season.

Statistics for sacks were not officially counted in his day, but Antwine is recognized as having 38 sacks in his 142 games with the Patriots (36) and Eagles (2), though other sources (including the Patriots team sources) report him having 39 sacks just with the Patriots. He led the team in three straight seasons (1967–1969).

Antwine was one of over twenty African American players who boycotted the 1965 AFL All-Star game in New Orleans because of unequal racial treatment throughout the city leading up to the game, later joined by some white players. As a result, the game was moved to Houston. New Orleans later had to demonstrate to the NFL changes were made in the city, so it could obtain an NFL franchise. 

== Honors ==
He was named to the American Football League All-Time Team in 1970 as a first-team defensive tackle alongside Tom Sestak (with future Hall of Famer Buck Buchanan named a second-team tackle). In addition to being a six-time AFL All Star, he was named All AFL six times, including first team selections by the AFL (1963, 1966), AP (1963), UPI (1963, 1966), NEA (1963, 1966, 1968) and &quot;The Sporting News&quot; (1968-1969); and second team selections by the AP (1966-1969), UPI (1964, 1967-1968), and &quot;The Sporting News&quot; (1967).

After years of being a finalist, Antwine was finally inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2015. He was also a member of the Patriots&#x27; 50th anniversary all time team.

==Personal life==
Antwine died of heart failure in Memphis, Tennessee on December 26, 2011, less than a day before his wife Evelyn died of lung cancer.

<text>Donald Ray January (November 20, 1929 – May 7, 2023) was an American professional golfer, best known for winning the 1967 PGA Championship.

==Early life==
Born in Plainview, Texas, January graduated from Sunset High School in Dallas. He was a member of the North Texas State golf team that won four consecutive NCAA Division I titles from 1949 to 1952. January is a member of the Sunset High School Hall of Fame.

While in college as a sophomore, as part of his scholarship, January helped teach a beginning golf class, where he met his future wife, Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; Rushing. They both graduated in 1953 and eloped to Ardmore, Oklahoma. They lived in San Antonio while Don was in the Air Force, and began their family—two boys and a girl.

==Professional career==
January won 10 PGA Tour titles, though never more than one in a year, with his most notable at the 1967 PGA Championship, an 18-hole playoff victory over Don Massengale. January had lost the 1961 PGA Championship in a playoff to Jerry Barber when his 68, the lowest losing score ever in an 18-hole playoff for a major championship, was bested by Barber&#x27;s 67. He won the Vardon Trophy for lowest scoring average in 1976 at the age of 47. He was a member of the U.S. Ryder Cup team in both 1965 and 1977.

January was responsible for a change to the rules of golf. During the 1963 Phoenix Open, January had a putt roll up to the lip of the hole and stop. January claimed that the ball was still moving, and waited for seven minutes for the ball to drop (it never did). Rule 16-2 was revised in 1964 to state that players had to tap the ball in within ten seconds or be penalized.

In the period between his last PGA Tour win and the start of the Senior PGA Tour, January devoted most of his professional efforts to a golf course design business, JanMart Enterprises, which he established with fellow Texan and PGA Tour golfer Billy Martindale.

January is well known for his success on the Senior PGA Tour (now the PGA Tour Champions), winning 22 events including two PGA Seniors&#x27; Championships. In 1980, he won the first official event on the Senior PGA Tour—the Atlantic City Senior International.

The &quot;Don January Golf Classic&quot; is a golf tournament played annually in the spring that was established to honor him in 1990 by his alma mater, now known as the University of North Texas.

January appeared as himself on the March 6, 1961 episode of the game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. He received two votes.

==Death==
January died at his home in Dallas on May 7, 2023, at the age of 93.

<text>Paul Douglas Cornell (born 18 July 1967) is a British writer. He is best known for his work in television drama as well as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fiction, being the creator of one of the Doctor&#x27;s spin-off companions, Bernice Summerfield.

As well as &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, other British television dramas for which he has written include &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;Primeval&quot;, &quot;Casualty&quot;, &quot;Holby City&quot; and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. For American television, he has contributed an episode to the modern-day set Sherlock Holmes series &quot;Elementary&quot;.

Cornell has also written for a number of British comics, as well as Marvel Comics and DC Comics in the United States, and has had six original novels published.

He is one of only two people to be nominated for Hugo Awards in prose, comics and TV.

==Career==
Already known in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fan circles, Cornell&#x27;s professional writing career began in 1990 when he was a winner in a young writers&#x27; competition and his entry, &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, was produced and screened on BBC Two. Soon after, he wrote &quot;&quot;, a novel for the Virgin New Adventures series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels. &quot;Timewyrm: Revelation&quot; was a reworking of a serialised fan fiction piece Cornell had penned previously for the fanzine &quot;Queen Bat&quot;. Several other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels followed, including the award-winning &quot;Human Nature&quot;.

Cornell then began working for Granada Television, where he wrote for the popular children&#x27;s medical drama &quot;Children&#x27;s Ward&quot; and created his own children&#x27;s series &quot;Wavelength&quot; for Yorkshire Television, which ran for two series. He made the crossover to working in adult television full-time in 1996, when he was one of the main contributors to Granada&#x27;s supernatural soap opera &quot;Springhill&quot;, which ran for two years on Sky One and later on Channel 4.

After a short stint on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, he began working for other production companies, including contributing an episode in 1999 to Red Production Company&#x27;s anthology drama series &quot;Love in the 21st Century&quot; for Channel 4. His episode, entitled &quot;Masturbation&quot;, starred Ioan Gruffudd as Jack. He was due to be one of the writers on Red Production Company&#x27;s planned &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; spin-off series &quot;Misfits&quot;, but the series was never made, being abruptly cancelled by Channel 4.

In the 21st century he has written mainly for the BBC, contributing episodes to all three of their regular medical dramas: &quot;Casualty&quot;, &quot;Holby City&quot; and the daytime soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot;. He also contributed to the 1950s-set Sunday evening prime time drama series &quot;Born and Bred&quot; and was one of the writers of the 2005 series revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, writing the episode &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot;. The episode was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form in 2006 and came third in terms of votes for its category. Cornell later wrote a two-part story for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s 2007 series, based on his 1995 Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Human Nature&quot;. The title of the first episode was also &quot;Human Nature&quot;, while the second was titled &quot;The Family of Blood&quot;. In 2008, the two episodes were nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form.

In February 2006, Cornell announced in a post on his weblog that he would be writing an episode for the BBC&#x27;s forthcoming &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, produced by Tiger Aspect Productions for the same Saturday evening family slot as &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He later announced on his blog that he was also writing a second &quot;Robin Hood&quot; episode for later in the first series. His first episode, &quot;Who Shot the Sheriff?&quot;, aired on BBC One on 21 October 2006. His second, &quot;A Thing or Two About Loyalty&quot;, followed on 2 December 2006. He also wrote an episode for the second season of another Saturday evening family adventure programme, the ITV science-fiction series &quot;Primeval&quot;, transmitted in February 2008.

He also wrote the one-off pilot &quot;Pulse&quot;, which was shown on BBC Three in early June 2010.

Outside of television, he has been active in various other media, having written six &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels for Virgin Publishing and BBC Books during the 1990s, three &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio dramas for Big Finish Productions and a fully animated internet-broadcast &quot;Doctor Who&quot; adventure, &quot;Scream of the Shalka&quot; (starring Richard E. Grant as the Doctor) for bbc.co.uk in 2003. He has also written two mainstream science-fiction novels, &quot;Something More&quot; and &quot;British Summertime&quot; for Gollancz, and various novels, short stories and audio dramas based around a character he created for the New Adventures, Professor Bernice Summerfield, and whom he later licensed to Big Finish Productions.

He has also co-authored (often working with Keith Topping and Martin Day) several non-fiction books on television, including &quot;The Guinness Book of Classic British TV&quot;, &quot;X-treme Possibilities&quot; (a guide to &quot;The X-Files&quot;), and &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (a humorous guide to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;). (Topping and Day&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel &quot;The Devil Goblins from Neptune&quot; was also based on an original idea with Cornell.) He has also written comics, both for &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; and the &quot;2000 AD&quot; spin-off &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot;.

He has written &quot;Wisdom&quot;, a 6-issue limited series for Marvel Comics&#x27; MAX imprint, featuring the character Peter Wisdom, with art by Trevor Hairsine and Manuel Garcia.

It was announced at the 2007 Wizard World Chicago comic book convention that Cornell would be following Chris Claremont on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;New Excalibur&quot;. Plans were subsequently changed with the cancellation of the &quot;New Excalibur&quot; title and Cornell&#x27;s new project was announced as being titled &quot;Captain Britain and MI: 13&quot;. The third trade paperback, &quot;Vampire State&quot;, was nominated for the 2010 &quot;Best Graphic Story&quot; Hugo Award.

Cornell has also written &quot;Young Avengers Presents&quot; No. 4 (April 2008) and a Fantastic Four mini-series comic, &quot;True Story&quot;, which started in July 2008, which featured the team encountering characters from the pages of literary classics. In 2008, he wrote a comic which featured on the Doctor Who website. He has also written the &quot;Young Avengers&quot; limited series that ties into Dark Reign and &quot;Black Widow: Deadly Origin&quot; a mini-series that ties into the character&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;.

Cornell became the next &quot;Action Comics&quot; writer after &quot;War of the Supermen&quot;. Cornell signed with DC Comics exclusively in 2010 as part of writing for &quot;Action Comics&quot;. His 16-issue run on the series included number 900. In late 2010 and early 2011, Cornell completed nine issues set in Batman&#x27;s world: &quot;Knight &amp; Squire&quot;, a six-issue miniseries, and a three-issue run in &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, #17–19.

In September 2011, as part of DC&#x27;s The New 52 relaunch, Cornell became the writer for the DC Comics titles &quot;Demon Knights&quot; and &quot;Stormwatch&quot;. Cornell&#x27;s last DC work was the 14-issue science fiction series &quot;Saucer Country&quot;, which ended with the June 2013 issue.

Cornell is part of the regular panel of the podcast &quot;SF Squeecast&quot;, which won the 2012 and 2013 Hugo Award for best fancast.

In January 2016, Cornell announced his return to television drama work when he told followers on his Twitter feed that he had written his first script for US television, contributing an episode to the CBS Sherlock Holmes series &quot;Elementary&quot;.

In 2018, he started co-hosting (with Lizbeth Myles from the Verity! podcast) a podcast reviewing horror films made by Hammer Film Productions entitled Hammer House of Podcast.

==Personal life==
In an interview on the &quot;Doctor Who: DWO Whocast&quot;, Cornell stated that this entry in Wikipedia described him as &quot;both a Christian and a pagan&quot;, which he has chosen not to correct as it illustrates his sympathies for the pagan world. He then goes on to state that he is an Anglican but is very &quot;Low Church, almost a Calvinist&quot; and this is partly because he doesn&#x27;t enjoy hymns.

Spiritual themes are not uncommon in his work (for example, his novel &quot;Something More&quot;). Other frequent references in his work include owls.

Cornell is married to Caroline Symcox, currently the Vicar of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Fairford, who also has written &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-based audio plays for Big Finish Productions on her own and with Cornell. In 2021 Paul said that he and Caroline have a son now ten years old.

In 2010, he appeared as a contestant on an episode of the BBC Four quiz show &quot;Only Connect&quot;.

He has written novels, non-fiction, audio plays and comic scripts.

<text>David Clarence Boon (born 29 December 1960) is an Australian cricket match referee, former cricket commentator and international cricketer whose international playing career spanned the years 1984–1996. A right-handed batsman and a very occasional off-spin bowler, he played first-class cricket for both his home state Tasmania and English county side Durham. Boon was a part of the Australian team that won their first world title during the 1987 Cricket World Cup.

Known for his portly figure and distinctive moustache, Boon scored more than 7,000 runs at Test level, and made more than 100 appearances for both the Test and One Day International Australian side. After leaving the international game he went to England to captain Durham before retiring to become a national selector.

==Early life==

The son of Clarrie and Lesley, Boon was born in the northern Tasmanian city of Launceston on 29 December 1960. His younger sister Vanessa was born in 1964. His father Clarrie worked in a newsagency in Launceston, while his mother Lesley represented Australia at hockey before working with Clarrie at the newsagency after David was born. When David was approximately six years old his family moved from South Launceston to a house connected to his parents&#x27; newsagency in the Launceston central business district. The family returned to South Launceston when David was attending the Launceston Church Grammar School.

==Cricket career==

===1978–1984: Tasmania debut===
At the age of 17, Boon made his first-class debut for Tasmania during the state&#x27;s second season of Sheffield Shield cricket, 1978–79. Englishman Jack Simmons was coaching in Launceston at the time and was also captain of the Tasmanian team. He pushed the youngster forward as a possible Test player and mentored him during a long apprenticeship at first-class level. Boon later acknowledged Simmons by naming his son after him. &quot;Wisden&quot; wrote, &quot;Boon&#x27;s achievement in becoming a fine Test player from a state which at that stage was still to enter the Sheffield Shield [sic] is strong evidence of his singular determination&quot;.

===1984–1986: International debut===
Boon made his international debut in the third final of the 1983–84 World Series Cup between Australia and the West Indies. He scored 39 from 71 balls for the losing team and had to wait almost twelve months for another opportunity. A good performance for the Prime Minister&#x27;s XI in 1984–85 led to Boon&#x27;s Test debut, against the West Indies at Brisbane. He stood up well to the pace of the West Indies&#x27; bowlers and scored 51 in the second innings, batting at number six. After the match, Kim Hughes resigned the captaincy of Australia. Boon played two more Tests in the series, and was then trialled as a middle-order batsman in eight ODIs during the World Series Cup. His top score was 55, and he was omitted from the team for the finals.

Selected for the Ashes tour of England in 1985, Boon&#x27;s batting disappointed. He struggled to cope with spin bowling due to slow footwork and passed fifty only once in the first four Tests. He was subsequently omitted from the side for the last two Tests in the series. Australia lost the series 3–1. Returning to the team for the 1985–86 Test series against New Zealand, Boon batted at number three and top-scored with 81 in the second innings of the second Test at Sydney as Australia successfully chased a target of 260 to win. However, this series was lost as well.

===Promoted to opener===
Australia had long-standing problems finding a successful pair of opening batsmen. After Kepler Wessels quit the team in mid-summer, Boon was promoted to open with debutant Geoff Marsh for the Test series against India. He responded with his first Test century, 123 from 255 balls, in his debut in the position at Adelaide. Together with Marsh, Boon gave the Australian upper-order a stability it had not had for many years. In the third Test of the series at Sydney, he consolidated his position with an innings of 131. Despite this newly found batting solidity, Australia struggled in the series and drew all three Tests. Boon was also tried as an opener in the World Series Cup and made four half-centuries in twelve innings as Australia won the tournament for the first time in three years. On the following tour of New Zealand, Boon carried his bat for 58 not out in a total of 103 in the third Test at Auckland, which Australia lost.

Boon began the 1986 tour of India with a century in the Tied Test at Chennai and averaged 65 in another drawn series. He hit his maiden ODI century, 111 from 118 balls, in the first match of the series at Jaipur. Marsh also went on to score a century, becoming the first ever instance of both openers scoring a century in an ODI innings, yet Australia lost the match. However, he suffered a setback during the 1986–87 Ashes series when he lost form and was dropped after four Tests despite scoring 103 in the first innings at Adelaide. He was also omitted from the ODI team. At this stage, Australia was achieving very little success, and Boon had played in only three winning teams in 23 Tests.

===Player of the final: 1987 World Cup===
Boon returned to the ODI team for the Sharjah Cup tournament in the UAE during April 1987. Although Australia lost all three matches, Boon had scores of 71, 62 and 73, which secured his place for the fourth World Cup, held in India and Pakistan later in the year. His 447 runs (at 55.87 average) was a major contribution to Australia&#x27;s first World Cup victory. In the semi-final, he made 65 at Lahore against Pakistan and won the player of the match award in the final at Kolkata for his 75 from 125 balls.

The selectors persevered with Boon as a Test opener and he hit 143 from 255 balls when recalled for the first Test against New Zealand at Brisbane in late 1987. His ability to negotiate the bowling of Kiwi fast bowler Richard Hadlee contributed greatly to Australia winning its first Test series in four years. Against Sri Lanka at the Adelaide Oval he hit his highest ODI score of 122 (from 130 balls) and made 47 and 43 in the two finals of the World Series Cup, when Australia again defeated New Zealand. In January 1988, he made a fighting 184 not out in the second innings of the Bicentennial Test at Sydney to extricate Australia from a potentially match-losing position. He received the player-of-the-match award and was voted International Cricketer of the Year as the best performer over the Australian 1987-88 season.

===Back to number three===
Boon was less conspicuous during a tour of Pakistan and the home Test against the West Indies, until he hit 149 in the fourth Test against the West Indies at Sydney. His ODI form also hit a slump, and he contributed only one major innings in the World Series Cup, 71 against the West Indies at Sydney. Australia lost both Test series and the World Series. However, the team finally found sustained success, beginning with the 1989 tour of England. Boon returned to the number three position when Mark Taylor was brought into the team to partner Geoff Marsh. Boon compiled 442 runs at 55.25, without making a century, as Australia regained the Ashes 4–0. His best score was 94 at Lord&#x27;s.

Temporarily returned to the opening position to cover an injury to Marsh, Boon&#x27;s 1989–90 season was mixed. In a one-off Test against New Zealand at the WACA Ground in Perth, he hit his only Test double century, 200 (from 361 balls) out of 361 runs added while he was at the wicket. However, three of his next five Test innings were ducks, beginning a run of 12 consecutive innings when he failed to make a half-century. Boon broke this run with an important innings of 94 not out in the second Ashes Test in 1990–91. He guided Australia to a victory target of 197 runs after the team began at a shaky 2/10. Dismissed for 97 by the part time bowling of Graham Gooch in the following Test, Boon made amends with 121 in the second innings at Adelaide. He was the leading batsman of the series, scoring 530 at an average of 75.71.

===Leading batsman===
He began the 1991 series against the West Indies with a brave 109 not out in the first Test at Jamaica. However, he could not sustain his form against the West Indian pace bowlers and made only one half-century in the remaining eight innings of the series. Boon dominated the 1991–92 summer, scoring three Test centuries in his 556 runs (average 79.42) against India. He was consistent rather than spectacular on the tour of Sri Lanka. In the first Test against West Indies at Brisbane in 1992–93, Boon scored 48 and 111. His batting against the Caribbean fast attack demonstrated that he was now Australia&#x27;s best batsman. In England in 1993, he hit centuries in three consecutive Tests, at Lord&#x27;s, Nottingham and Leeds.

Boon&#x27;s 106 against New Zealand in 1993–94 was the first century by a Tasmanian in a Test played in Hobart. He played thirteen consecutive Test innings in double figures, including scores of 83 and 96 on the tour of South Africa in 1994, before scoring 114 not out in the first Test against Pakistan at Karachi in Mark Taylor&#x27;s first Test as captain. Although Boon was senior to Taylor in the team and had captained Tasmania for a number of seasons, he was never seriously considered to replace Allan Border as the team&#x27;s captain.

===Waning form===
After scoring 41 and 131 in the second Ashes Test of 1994–95, Boon&#x27;s form began to wane. As a member of the team that famously won the Frank Worrell Trophy in the Caribbean in 1995, he made one half-century (67 at Antigua) in six innings. In the 1995–96 series against Pakistan, he made 110 runs in five innings as speculation began to mount about his future in the team. In the second Test against Sri Lanka, he hit 110 and sensing that the time was right, announced his retirement from the game after the following Test at Adelaide. He went out of Test cricket with scores of 43 and 35.

===Durham captain===
Following his retirement from international cricket, Boon continued playing for Tasmania and signed to captain Durham in the English county championship. He led the team in three seasons between 1997 and 1999. He played the last of his 139 first-class games for Tasmania in the 1998–99 season, in which he scored 9,077 runs at 41.44 average with 22 centuries. In all he led Tasmania 57 times for 13 wins and 25 losses. When British journalist Sam Rathbone interviewed Neil Killeen in 2019, Killeen said that Boon got angry when an unidentified Durham squad member kept cutting the ends of Boon and the other players&#x27; socks off, saying &quot;I have a story for you. There was an unidentified teammate of ours at Durham who kept cutting the end of the other players&#x27; socks off, and David Boon got really angry, way angrier than the others. But that could have meant it was him, we still don&#x27;t know.&quot;

==Career-best performances==

==After cricket==
Boon was formerly a member of the Cricket Australia selection board, along with Merv Hughes, Andrew Hilditch and the newly appointed Jamie Cox.
In May 2011, it was announced that Boon would be standing down from his position on the selection board, and as general manager of Cricket Tasmania, to become an ICC match referee, replacing Alan Hurst on the ICC Elite Panel. He made his test debut as a match referee on 1 September 2011 in a one-off test between Zimbabwe and Pakistan at Bulawayo.

Boon became the face of Victoria Bitter (VB) beer for its 2005/06 &amp; 2006/07 summer advertising campaigns, called &quot;Boonanza&quot;. Part of the promotion was the sale of a talking David Boon figurine with purchases of beer, which would make comments when prompted by Channel Nine commentary. One health expert claimed it was &quot;..a dog-whistle marketing strategy directed at the heavy-drinking, sporting public that says, &#x27;Go for it&#x27;.&quot;

==Personality, personal life and legacy==
Nicknamed &quot;Boony&quot;, the stocky, moustachioed batsman became something of a cult figure for his colourful character.

Boon was the subject of a regular skit on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s comedy show &quot;The Late Show&quot; in a segment called &quot;The Oz Brothers&quot;. The Oz Brothers idolise Boon, and are long bemused that he is continually overlooked for the honour of being named &quot;Australian of the Year&quot;.

Boon is said to have consumed 52 cans of beer on a flight from Sydney to London in 1989. This has never been confirmed by Boon, although the feat was confirmed by his teammate Geoff Lawson and his roommate on that tour, Dean Jones. Responding to the story, Ian Chappell said, &quot;In my day 58 beers between London and Sydney would have virtually classified you as a teetotaller.&quot; Boon had always denied the story, adding &quot;If people haven’t got something else to talk about they have led a fucking boring life&quot;, but, as Rob Smyth reported in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;there are enough witnesses, one or two of them sober, to suggest that it happened&quot;. Boon spoke about the feat in a podcast in 2022, in which he expressed regret over the beer consumption.

The Southern Stand at Bellerive Oval was named &quot;David Boon Stand&quot; in his honour.

<text>Nationwide Communications Inc., originally known as Peoples Broadcasting Corporation, was a media subsidiary of the Nationwide Insurance Company, which operated from 1946 until 1997. Based in Columbus, Ohio, Nationwide Communications owned and operated a variety of radio and television stations across the United States until it sold off all its radio stations to Cincinnati-based Jacor for a reported $620 million, and its television stations to Young Broadcasting. The service division was spun off and became Nationwide Communications Services L.L.C. in 1998.

In 1946, the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation first got into broadcasting through a radio service for farmers on WRFD, Columbus, Ohio, an AM radio station. The Ohio Farm Bureau was dedicated to serving farmers in Ohio, but as its other pursuits (chiefly the Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Insurance Company) were increasingly made available to non-farmers, the Farm Bureau spun off these ventures into a separate corporation. WRFD continued to serve farmers, and indeed, still carries farm programming today under the ownership of Salem Media of Ohio. However, other Farm Bureau stations—most notably WRFD-FM, now known as WNCI—were transferred to this umbrella corporation, known today as the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company &amp; Affiliated Companies. The group of stations became known as Nationwide Communications, after its parent company.

Nationwide Communications owned a total of five television stations, though none in its home market of Columbus, or Ohio. The first television station it owned was KVTV-TV (now KCAU-TV) in Sioux City, Iowa, which was sold in 1965 to purchase WATE-TV, Channel 6, Knoxville, Tennessee. The company&#x27;s second purchase was WXEX-TV (now WRIC-TV), Channel 8, Petersburg, Virginia in 1968, its third station was WBAY-TV, Channel 2, Green Bay, Wisconsin, purchased in 1974, and its fourth station purchase was KITN (now WFTC), Channel 29, in Minneapolis in 1985. Three of the four stations were ABC affiliates (WXEX-TV switched from NBC to ABC in 1965, WATE-TV switched from NBC to ABC in 1979, and WBAY-TV switched from CBS to ABC in 1992); the fourth (KITN/WFTC) was an independent and later a Fox affiliate while under Nationwide&#x27;s stewardship. Nationwide Communications sold all three of its ABC-affiliated television stations in 1993 to Young Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Adam Young, Incorporated, a TV station advertising representation firm; WFTC was sold to Clear Channel Communications the next year. In November 2013, Young merged with Media General, and then itself was merged with Nexstar Media Group in January 2017. WATE and WRIC are now under that company&#x27;s ownership, while WBAY was spun-off to Gray Television.

In the early 1970s, Nationwide was awarded a license to operate a UHF television station in Columbus, Ohio, on channel 28, with the assigned call letters WNCI-TV. Nationwide, however, did not complete construction of the television station and its license and construction permit was allowed to lapse. The frequency allocation was ultimately awarded to Commercial Radio Institute, Inc. of Baltimore, Maryland, which began operation of WTTE. WTTE was the second station owned by the company now known as the Sinclair Broadcast Group.

Before ceasing operations, Nationwide Communications was the 16th largest radio group in the United States. Throughout its history, Nationwide owned and operated radio stations in Minnesota, Florida, Ohio, Nevada, Texas, Arizona, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington and California.

<text>Friedrich Heinrich, Freiherr von Kittlitz (16 February 1799 – 10 April 1874) was a Prussian artist, naval officer, explorer and naturalist. He was a descendant of a family of old Prussian nobility (&quot;Freiherr&quot; meaning &quot;independent lord&quot; - ranking with a baron). He collected specimens and made illustrations on major expeditions and wrote a few books on his travels. Several species were described on the basis of specimens collected by him and a few are named after him including Kittlitz&#x27;s plover.

== Life and work ==

Kittlitz was born in Breslau to Prussian Captain Friedrich (1769-1825) and Henriette Ehrenfried von Diebitsch (1771-1835). He went to grammar school in Oels and joined his father&#x27;s battalion as a volunteer in 1813. He became a second lieutenant in the 16th Silesian Infantry Regiment and saw action at Glogau. He went to Paris in 1815 and was garrisoned in Mainz when the Landwehr regiments were dissolved. It was here that he became interested in nature after meeting Eduard Rüppell. Through the influence of his maternal uncle Hans Karl von Diebitsch, field marshal in Russia, that he joined the Russian corvette &quot;Senjawin&quot; on a circumnavigational expedition between 1826 and 1829 under the leadership of Captain Fyodor Petrovich Litke (1797-1882). He travelled along with Prince Karl of Prussia to St. Petersburg and the expedition set sail on September 1. He made large collections on this expedition for the museum of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg with 754 specimens of 314 bird species, including species that subsequently became extinct. Among them are the Micronesian species, Kosrae crake (&quot;Porzana monasa&quot;) and Kosrae starling (&quot;Aplonis corvina&quot;) which are known only from his specimens. He published &quot;Twenty-four Views of the Vegetation of the Coasts and Islands of the Pacific&quot; (1844).

Kittlitz travelled to North Africa in 1831 with his friend Eduard Rüppell, but had to return to Germany due to poor health. It was during his time in Egypt whilst waiting for a boat that he collected specimens of the bird which became known as Kittlitz&#x27;s plover.

Kittlitz&#x27;s murrelet, Kittlitz&#x27;s rail, Kittlitz&#x27;s thrush and Kittlitz&#x27;s plover are all named for him.

<text>The Buffalo AKG Art Museum, formerly known as the Albright–Knox Art Gallery, is an art museum located adjacent to Delaware Park, Buffalo, New York, United States. The museum was expanded beginning in 2021, and re-opened in June 2023.

The museum shows modern art and contemporary art. It is directly opposite Buffalo State University and the Burchfield Penney Art Center. It is named after three major donors, John J. Albright, Seymour H. Knox II, and Jeffrey Gundlach.

==History==
The parent organization of the Buffalo AKG Art Museum is the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy, founded in 1862, one of the oldest public arts institutions in the United States. On January 15, 1900, Buffalo entrepreneur and philanthropist John J. Albright, a wealthy Buffalo industrialist, donated funds to the Academy to begin construction of an art gallery. The building was designed by prominent local architect Edward Brodhead Green. It was originally intended to be used as the Fine Arts Pavilion for the Pan-American Exposition in 1901, but delays in its construction caused it to remain uncompleted until 1905. When it finally opened its doors on May 31, 1905, it was named the Albright Art Gallery.

Clifton Hall, the third building on the museum&#x27;s campus, was constructed in 1920 as the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences. In 1927, the dilapidated building was renovated until 1929, when it was reopened as the Albright Art School. The sponsor was Charles Clifton, which is why the building was named Clifton Hall.

In 1962, a new addition was made to the gallery through the contributions of Seymour H. Knox, Jr. and his family, and many other donors. At this time, the museum was renamed the Albright–Knox Art Gallery. The new building was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill architect Gordon Bunshaft, who is noted for the Lever House in New York City. The Buffalo AKG Art Museum is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

The museum first began discussing a possible expansion in 2001. In 2012, the board commissioned the architectural firm Snøhetta to produce a master plan for future growth. In 2014, the board voted to initiate a museum expansion and, in June 2016, the museum announced its selection of OMA partner Shohei Shigematsu as the architect for the project. It is the first art museum designed by this association of architects in the United States. Doubleline CEO and Buffalo native Jeffrey Gundlach pledged $42.5 million to the project, while businesses, foundations, government groups, and individuals promised matching funds toward a $125 million goal. Another 20 million came from New York State. In recognition of Gundlach&#x27;s donation, a newly constructed building was named the Jeffrey E. Gundlach Building. The museum would be renamed the Buffalo AKG Art Museum, representing the names of the museum&#x27;s historical donors, on the completion of the renovations and its reopening in spring 2023.

The Seymour H. Knox Building, until its renovation, had an open courtyard that was not accessible to museum visitors. As part of the redesign of the terrain, a new artwork was created by artists Ólafur Elíasson and Sebastian Behmann, &quot;Common Sky,&quot; which now encloses this courtyard: &quot;At once architectural and sculptural, &quot;Common Sky&quot; presents a canopy of glass and mirrors rendered in alternating triangular segments that allow the light to pour into the space below. Visitors can look up and see themselves reflected in the mirrors too, creating a synergistic and kaleidoscopic pushing and pulling of reflections and space. &quot;Common Sky&quot;’s form tapers into the courtyard itself, with a cyclone-shaped column that leads to a complex system of drains below. This asymmetrical element nods both to the location of a lone hawthorn tree planted in the original courtyard in the 1960s, while simultaneously serving as a drainage system of rain and snow that Buffalo is famed for.&quot; The resulting community gathering space was given the name &quot;Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. Town Square&quot; in honor of the $11 million donation of Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. and the Wilson Foundation for the renovation.

Clifton Hall houses, among other things, the museum&#x27;s archives, offices for the staff as well as the &quot;F. Paul Norton and Frederic P. Norton Family Prints And Drawings Study Center&quot;, and working spaces for the Public Art Initiative.

The Seymour H. Knox Building now includes rooms where visitors can participate in art workshops themselves, the so-called Creative Commons, which represents the first cooperation of the Lego Foundation with a museum. Likewise, it houses the Cornelia restaurant, which features an almost glass mosaic by artist Firelei Báez.

The Jeffrey E. Gundlach Building, a circular glass building, opened in August of 2023 and added more than to the museum&#x27;s exhibition and five studio classrooms. The first floor of the building houses the Nordic Gallery, dedicated to contemporary Scandinavian art. The third floor of the building showcases the museum&#x27;s new acquisitions.

The museum is part of the Monuments Men and Women Museum Network, launched in 2021 by the Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art.

In November 2023, a unionization campaign was launched by museum employees across the visitor experience, facilities, and food services departments, with employees filing a petition for the election with the National Labor Relations Board in January 2024. This vote follows AKG Workers United filing unfair labor practice charges against the museum, accusing its leadership of &quot;heightening surveillance of employees and re-enforcing workplace rules in direct response to unionization efforts.&quot; Museum officials have denied these allegations and have stated: &quot;Regardless of the decision, we are committed to continuing to work collaboratively to support all of our Buffalo AKG team.”

==Exhibitions==
In 1910, the museum hosted the International Exhibition of Pictorial Photography (November 3–December 1, 1910), curated by Alfred Stieglitz. It was the first ever show organized by an American museum that aimed to elevate photography&#x27;s stature to that of a fine art. 

In 1978, the museum&#x27;s exhibition on the work of Richard Diebenkorn was chosen to represent the United States at the 28th Venice Biennale. In 1988, the museum again won the competition to organize the exhibition representing the United States in Venice; the museum&#x27;s curator Michael G. Auping proposed media artist Jenny Holzer.

==Collection==

The Buffalo AKG Art Museum has long operated not by collecting artists&#x27; work in depth, but by trying to acquire key works. The gallery&#x27;s collection includes works spanning Impressionistic and Post-Impressionistic styles by artists of the nineteenth century such as Paul Gauguin, Edgar Degas, Berthe Morisot, Claude Monet, and Vincent van Gogh.

Revolutionary styles from the early twentieth century such as abstraction, cubism, surrealism, and constructivism are represented in works by artists like Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Matisse, André Derain, Joan Miró, Piet Mondrian, Giacomo Balla, Sonia Delaunay, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Amedeo Modigliani, and Alexander Rodchenko. Frida Kahlo is represented by &quot;Self-Portrait with Monkey&quot;. 

Because of Seymour H. Knox and Gordon M. Smith, a former director, the Albright-Knox was one of the first museums to collect Abstract Expressionism in depth. That movement is widely represented in the collection with works by artists including Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock, Joan Mitchell, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, Adolph Gottlieb, and Helen Frankenthaler. The museum owns the second-largest collection of paintings by Clyfford Still: 33 abstract works that span the most critical developments of his career from 1937 to 1963. They include 31 paintings donated to the museum in 1964 by Still and two paintings acquired in 1957 and 1959 as gifts of Seymour H. Knox, Jr.

Additionally, the gallery is rich in further examples of post-war American and European art. Works of pop art, minimalism, and art of the 1970s through the end of the twentieth century can be found represented by artists such as Lee Bontecou, Chryssa, Alberto Giacometti, Eva Hesse, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Howardena Pindell, Ed Clark, Kiki Smith, Félix González-Torres, and Andy Warhol. 

At her death in 2016 pop artist Marisol left her estate to the museum including hundreds of works of art, making it the largest collection of her work in the world. 

Their contemporary collection includes pieces by artists such as Cory Arcangel, Tony Conrad, Mark Bradford, Nick Cave, Simone Leigh, Georg Baselitz, John Connell, and Per Kirkeby. The museum bought Anselm Kiefer&#x27;s large-scale &quot;Die Milchstrasse (The Milkyway)&quot; (1985–1987) in 1988 to celebrate its 125th anniversary.

Before its 2019-2023 expansion, the Buffalo AKG Art Museum exhibition space could accommodate only 200 works — just 3% of its 6,740-piece collection.

==Selected collection highlights==
===Paintings===

The Buffalo AKG Art Museum has more than 6,500 works in its collection, below is a list highlighting a few other notable works:

===Sculptures===
The gallery contains a variety of sculptures on the exterior grounds. Some of the most notable, from the past and the present, include:

==Deaccessioning and the museum&#x27;s mission==

In 2007, the Albright–Knox Art Gallery sold a Roman-era bronze sculpture, &quot;Artemis and the Stag&quot;, that was auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s New York on June 7, 2007, and brought $28.6 million. This was the highest price ever paid at auction for an antiquity or a sculpture of any period, according to Sotheby&#x27;s. It was purchased by the London dealer Giuseppe Eskenazi on behalf of a private European collector.

The event brought national attention to what until then had been a local question, the mission of the Albright-Knox. In February 2007, when the list of works to be deaccessioned was made public, Albright-Knox Director Louis Grachos defined the ancient sculpture as falling outside the institution&#x27;s historical &quot;core mission&quot; of &quot;acquiring and exhibiting art of the present.&quot; This definition made public critics wonder whether the position at the Gallery of &quot;William Hogarth&#x27;s &quot;Lady&#x27;s Last Stake&quot; or Sir Joshua Reynolds&#x27; &quot;Cupid as a Link Boy&quot; were secure. Works by Gustave Courbet, Honoré Daumier, Jacques-Louis David, and Eugène Delacroix had been purchased by the museum in earlier decades.

The decision to deaccession certain art works was made by a vote of the museum&#x27;s board of directors, was voted on and ratified by the entire membership, and followed the guidelines of the American Alliance of Museums. The sale raised questions about how museums can remain vital when they are situated in economically declining regions and have limited means for raising funds for operations and acquisitions.

==Hours==
The museum is open from 10 am to 8 pm, Thursday and Friday, and 10 am to 5 pm, Saturday through Monday. On the first Friday of each month, admission to the museum is Pay What You Wish sponsored by M&amp;T Bank.

==Management==
===Governance===
Since 2013, Janne Sirén has been director of the Albright–Knox Art Gallery. Sirén is believed to be the first director from the Nordic region to take the helm of a major American art museum.

Complete list of directors:
* Janne Gallen-Kallela-Sirén (2013–present)
* Louis Grachos (2002–2013)
* Douglas G. Schultz (1983–2002)
* Robert T. Buck, Jr. (1973–1983)
* Gordon M. Smith (1955–1973)
* Edgar C. Schenck (1949–1955) 
* Andrew C. Ritchie (1942–1949) 
* Gordon B. Washburn (1931–1942) 
* William M. Hekking (1925–1931) 
* Cornelia Bentley Sage Quinton (1910–1924) 
* Charles McMeen Kurtz (1905–1909)

===Funding===
As of 2007, the Albright–Knox Art Gallery&#x27;s endowment stood at about $58 million, generating about $1.1 million a year for acquisitions. Since the proceeds from the sale of some 200 works of art in 2007 were added to the preexisting $22 million acquisitions endowment, the museum has been able to spend as much as almost $5 million on new art annually. In 2013, the Albright–Knox Art Gallery received an $11 million bequest from the estate of longtime board member and Buffalo arts patron Peggy Pierce Elfvin, the largest single gift in the museum&#x27;s history at that time. In 2016, Los Angeles financier Jeffrey Gundlach contributed $42.5 million, the largest donation from a single individual in the museum&#x27;s history.

<text>Sonata rondo form is a musical form often used during the Classical and Romantic music eras. As the name implies, it is a blend of sonata and rondo forms.

== Structure ==

=== Sonata and rondo forms ===
Rondo form involves the repeated use of a theme (sometimes called the &quot;refrain&quot;) set in the tonic key, alternating with episodes, resulting in forms such as ABACA (the five-part rondo) or ABACADA (the seven-part rondo). In a rondo, the refrain (A) may be varied slightly. The episodes (B, C, D, etc.) are normally in a different key than the tonic.

Sonata form is a classical form composed of three main sections, namely exposition, development, and recapitulation. A sonata may begin with an introduction, which is commonly slower than the remainder of the movement. After that, there is an exposition, whose purpose is to present the movement&#x27;s main thematic material. This takes the form of one or two themes or theme groups, the second of which is commonly in a related key. The exposition may conclude with a short codetta or closing theme and may be repeated. This is followed by the development section, in which existing thematic material may be presented in new harmonic and textural contexts or entirely new material may be introduced. Next comes the recapitulation, where all themes or theme groups from the exposition are presented again but now in the tonic key. Sonatas may optionally end with a final large section called the coda.

The following shows the structure of sonata form. In the notation, a single prime (&#x27;) means &quot;in the dominant&quot; and a double prime (&quot;) means &quot;in remote keys&quot;.

:[A B&#x27;]exp [C&quot;]dev [A B]recap

Occasionally, sonata form includes an &quot;episodic development,&quot; which uses mostly new thematic material. Two examples are the first movements of Mozart&#x27;s piano sonata K. 330 and Beethoven&#x27;s piano sonata Op. 14, no. 1. The episodic development is often the kind of development that is used in sonata rondo form, to which we now turn.

=== Sonata rondo form ===
Sonata rondo form combines features of the five-part rondo and sonata form. The simplest kind of sonata rondo form is a sonata form that repeats the opening material in the tonic at the end of the exposition and recapitulation sections.

:[A B&#x27; A]exp [C&quot;]dev [A B A]recap

By adding in these extra appearances of A, the form reads off as AB&#x27;AC&quot;ABA, hence the alternation of A with &quot;other&quot; material that characterizes the rondo. Note that if the development is an episodic development, then C&quot; will be new thematic material—thus increasing the resemblance of sonata rondo form to an actual rondo.

==== &quot;Six-part&quot; variants ====
Mozart sometimes used a variant type of sonata rondo form in which the first &quot;A&quot; section of the recapitulation is omitted. Thus:

:[A B&#x27; A]exp [C&quot;]dev [B A]recap

Mozart&#x27;s purpose was perhaps to create a sense of variety by not having the main theme return at such regular intervals. He used the form in the finales of his piano quartets and a number of his piano concertos.

Another six-part sonata rondo form may be written as:

:[A B&#x27; A]exp [C&quot;]dev [A B]recap

This instance occurs in the 4th movement of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 6 in B minor.

== Codas ==

Often, regular sonata form includes a coda:

:[A B&#x27;]exp [C&quot;]dev [A B]recap [D]coda

This longer version of sonata form has a counterpart in sonata rondo form.

:[A B&#x27; A]exp [C&quot;]dev [A B A]recap [D]coda

Thus: AB&#x27;AC&quot;ABAD. An example is the last movement of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Pathetique&quot; Sonata, Op. 13.

== Sonata rondo form as a variant of rondo form ==

It is also possible to describe sonata rondo form by starting out with rondo form and describing how it is transformed to be more like sonata form. For this explanation, see rondo.

Cuthbert Girdlestone conjectured in his &quot;Mozart and His Piano Concertos&quot; that the sonata rondo form derives also in part from the dances &quot;en rondeau&quot; of Jean-Philippe Rameau, among others, by structural elaboration, possibly an innovation of Mozart&#x27;s.

== Uses of the sonata rondo form ==

Sonata rondo form is almost exclusively used in the finales of multi-movement works. It is considered a somewhat relaxed and discursive form. Thus, it is unsuited to an opening movement (typically the musically tightest and most intellectually rigorous movement in a Classical work). It is, exceptionally, used in the opening Andante movement of Haydn&#x27;s D-major piano sonata Hob. XVI:51. Here are some movements written in sonata rondo form:

**Piano Sonata No. 13, K. 333 (1783), last movement

<text>Clandestine chemistry is chemistry carried out in secret, and particularly in illegal drug laboratories. Larger labs are usually run by gangs or organized crime intending to produce for distribution on the black market. Smaller labs can be run by individual chemists working clandestinely in order to synthesize smaller amounts of controlled substances or simply out of a hobbyist interest in chemistry, often because of the difficulty in ascertaining the purity of other, illegally synthesized drugs obtained on the black market. The term &quot;clandestine lab&quot; is generally used in any situation involving the production of illicit compounds, regardless of whether the facilities being used qualify as a true laboratory.

==History==
Ancient forms of clandestine chemistry included the manufacturing of explosives.

From 1919 to 1933, the United States prohibited the sale, manufacture, or transportation of alcoholic beverages. This opened a door for brewers to supply their own town with alcohol. Just like modern-day drug labs, distilleries were placed in rural areas. The term &quot;moonshine&quot; generally referred to &quot;corn whiskey&quot;, that is, a whiskey-like liquor made from corn. Today, American-made corn whiskey can be labeled or sold under that name, or as Bourbon or Tennessee whiskey, depending on the details of the production process.

==Psychoactive substances==

===By precursor chemicals===
Prepared substances (as opposed to those that occur naturally in a consumable form, such as cannabis and psilocybin mushrooms) require reagents. Some drugs, like cocaine and morphine, are extracted from plant sources and refined with the aid of chemicals. Semi-synthetic drugs such as heroin are made starting from alkaloids extracted from plant sources which are the precursors for further synthesis. In the case of heroin, a mixture of alkaloids is extracted from the opium poppy (&quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;) by incising its seed capsule, whereupon a milky fluid (the opium &#x27;latex&#x27;) bleeds out of the incisions which is then left to dry out and scraped off the bulbs, yielding raw opium. Morphine, one of many alkaloids in opium, is then extracted out of the opium by acid-base extraction and turned into heroin by reacting it with acetic anhydride. Other drugs (such as methamphetamine and MDMA) are normally made from commercially available chemicals, though both can also be made from naturally occurring precursors. Methamphetamine can also be made from ephedrine, one of the naturally occurring alkaloids in ephedra (&quot;Ephedra sinica&quot;). MDMA can be made from safrole, the major constituent of several etheric oils like sassafras. Governments have adopted a strategy of chemical control as part of their overall drug control and enforcement plans. Chemical control offers a means of attacking illicit drug production and disrupting the process before the drugs have entered the market.

Because many legitimate industrial chemicals such as anhydrous ammonia and iodine are also necessary in the processing and synthesis of most illicitly produced drugs, preventing the diversion of these chemicals from legitimate commerce to illicit drug manufacturing is a difficult job. Governments often place restrictions on the purchase of large quantities of chemicals that can be used in the production of illicit drugs, usually requiring licenses or permits to ensure that the purchaser has a legitimate need for them.

====Suppliers of precursor chemicals====
Chemicals critical to the production of cocaine, heroin, and synthetic drugs are produced in many countries throughout the world. Many manufacturers and suppliers exist in Europe, China, India, the United States, and many other countries.

Historically, chemicals critical to the synthesis or manufacture of illicit drugs are introduced into various venues via legitimate purchases by companies that are registered and licensed to do business as chemical importers or handlers. Once in a country or state, the chemicals are diverted by rogue importers or chemical companies, by criminal organizations and individual violators, or acquired as a result of coercion and/or theft on the part of drug traffickers. In response to stricter international controls, drug traffickers have increasingly been forced to divert chemicals by mislabeling the containers, forging documents, establishing front companies, using circuitous routing, hijacking shipments, bribing officials, or smuggling products across international borders.

====Enforcement of controls on precursor chemicals====

=====General=====
The Multilateral Chemical Reporting Initiative encourages governments to exchange information on a voluntary basis in order to monitor international chemical shipments. Over the past decade, key international bodies like the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the U.N. General Assembly&#x27;s Special Session (UNGASS) have addressed the issue of chemical diversion in conjunction with U.S. efforts. These organizations raised specific concerns about potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride.

To facilitate the international flow of information about precursor chemicals, the United States, through its relationship with the Inter-American Drug Control Abuse Commission (CICAD), continues to evaluate the use of precursor chemicals and assist countries in strengthening controls. Many nations still lack the capacity to determine whether the import or export of precursor chemicals is related to legitimate needs or illicit drugs. The problem is complicated by the fact that many chemical shipments are either brokered or transshipped through third countries in an attempt to disguise their purpose or destination.

Beginning in July 2001, the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) has opted to organize an international conference with the goal of devising a specific action plan to counter the traffic in MDMA precursor chemicals. They hope to prevent the diversion of chemicals used in the production of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), including MDMA (ecstasy) and methamphetamine.

In June 2015, the European Commission approved Regulation (EU) 2015/1013 which outlined for the monitoring of drug precursors traded between the Union and third countries. The Regulation also establishes uniform procedures for licensing and registration of operators and users who are listed in a European database tracking drug precursors.

Despite this long history of law enforcement actions, restrictions of chemicals, and even covert military actions, many illicit drugs are still widely available all over the world.

=====Cocaine=====
Operation Purple is a U.S. DEA driven international chemical control initiative designed to reduce the illicit manufacture of cocaine in the Andean Region, identifying rogue firms and suspect individuals; gathering intelligence on diversion methods, trafficking trends, and shipping routes; and taking administrative, civil and/or criminal action as appropriate. Critical to the success of this operation is the communication network that gives notification of shipments and provides the government of the importer sufficient time to verify the legitimacy of the transaction and take appropriate action. The effects of this initiative have been dramatic and far-reaching. Operation Purple has exposed a significant vulnerability among traffickers, and has grown to include almost thirty nations. According to the DEA, Operation Purple has been highly effective at interfering with cocaine production. However, illicit chemists always find new methods to evade the DEA&#x27;s scrutiny.

In countries where strict chemical controls have been put in place, illicit drug production has been seriously affected. For example, few of the chemicals needed to process coca leaf into cocaine are manufactured in Bolivia or Peru. Most are smuggled in from neighbouring countries with advanced chemical industries or diverted from a smaller number of licit handlers. Increased interdiction of chemicals in Peru and Bolivia has contributed to final product cocaine from those countries being of lower, minimally oxidized quality.

As a result, Bolivian lab operators are now using inferior substitutes such as cement instead of lime and sodium bicarbonate instead of ammonia and recycled solvents like ether. Some non-solvent fuels such as gasoline, kerosene and diesel fuel are even used in place of solvents. 
Manufacturers are attempting to streamline a production process that virtually eliminates oxidation to produce cocaine base. Some laboratories are not using sulfuric acid during the maceration state; consequently, less cocaine alkaloid is extracted from the leaf, producing less cocaine hydrochloride, the powdered cocaine marketed for overseas consumption.

=====Heroin=====
Similarly, heroin-producing countries depend on supplies of acetic anhydride (AA) from the international market. This heroin precursor continues to account for the largest volume of internationally seized chemicals, according to the International Narcotics Control Board. Since July 1999, there have been several notable seizures of acetic anhydride in Turkey (amounting to nearly seventeen metric tons) and Turkmenistan (totaling seventy-three metric tons).

Acetic anhydride, the most commonly used chemical agent in heroin processing, is virtually irreplaceable. According to the DEA, Mexico remains the only heroin source route to heroin laboratories in Afghanistan. Authorities in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan routinely seize ton-quantity shipments of diverted acetic anhydride.

The lack of acetic anhydride has caused clandestine chemists in some countries to substitute it for lower quality precursors such as acetic acid and results in the formation of impure black tar heroin that contains a mixture of drugs not found in heroin made with pure chemicals.

DEA&#x27;s Operation Topaz is a coordinated international strategy targeting acetic anhydride. In place since March 2001, a total of thirty-one countries are currently organized participants in the program in addition to regional participants. The DEA reports that as of June 2001, some 125 consignments of acetic anhydride had been tracked totaling 618,902,223 kilograms. As of July 2001, there has been approximately 20 shipments of AA totaling 185,000 kilograms either stopped or seized.

=====Amphetamines=====


The practice of clandestine chemistry to synthesize controlled substance analogues and circumvent drug laws was first noticed in the late 1960s, as types of drugs became controlled substances in many countries. With the Title 21 United States Code (USC) Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of October 27, 1970 amphetamines became controlled substances in the United States. Prior to this, amphetamine sulfate first became widely available as an over-the-counter (OTC) nasal decongestant inhaler in 1933, marketed by SKF under the brand name Benzedrine. Shortly afterward, physicians began documenting amphetamine&#x27;s general stimulant properties and subsequently its potential for treating narcolepsy, which prompted SKF in 1938 to begin also manufacturing amphetamine sulfate as tablets. Initially, the frequency of amphetamine use was negligible; however, by 1959 its popularity as a therapeutic agent and also an illicit drug had skyrocketed nationwide, causing the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) to reclassify amphetamine from OTC to prescription-only.

=====Methamphetamine=====
As of the early 1990s, methamphetamine use was concentrated among young white males in California and nearby states. Since then its use has spread both demographically and geographically. Methamphetamine has been a favorite among various populations including motorcycle gangs, truckers, laborers, soldiers, and ravers. Known as a &quot;club drug&quot;, the National Institute on Drug Abuse tracks its incidence of use in children as young as twelve, and the prevalence of users increases with age.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, most methamphetamine production in the United States occurred in small independent laboratories. Phenylacetone, one precursor of methamphetamine, became a Schedule II controlled immediate precursor in 1979. Underground chemists searched for alternative methods for producing methamphetamine. The two predominant methods which appeared both involve the reduction of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine. At the time, neither was a watched chemical, and pills containing the substance could be bought by the thousands without raising any kind of suspicion.

In the 1990s, the DEA recognized that legally imported precursors were being diverted to the production of methamphetamine. Changes to federal regulations in 1988 and throughout the 1990s enabled the DEA to more closely track the ephedrine and pseudoephedrine precursors. Many individual States have enacted precursor control laws which limit the sale of over-the-counter cold medications which contain ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. This made it somewhat more difficult for underground chemists to produce methamphetamine. In May 1995, the DEA shut down two major suppliers of precursors in the United States, seizing 25 metric tons of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine from Clifton Pharmaceuticals and 500 cases of pseudoephedrine from X-Pressive Looks, Inc. (XLI). The immediate market impact suggests that they had been providing more than 50 percent of the precursors used nationally to produce methamphetamine. However, the market rapidly rebounded.

The methamphetamine situation also changed in the mid-1990s as Mexican organized crime became a major player in its production and distribution, operating &quot;super-labs&quot; which produced a substantial percentage of the drugs being sold. According to the DEA, the seizure of 3.5 metric tons of pseudoephedrine in Texas in 1994 revealed that Mexican trafficking groups were producing methamphetamine on an unprecedented scale. More recent reports indicate an ongoing presence of Mexican trafficking.

===By process===

====Distillation====

=====Alcohol=====

Another old form of clandestine chemistry is the illegal brewing and distillation of alcohol. This is frequently done to avoid taxation on spirits.

In some countries, moonshine stills are illegal to sell, import, and own without permission. However, enthusiasts explain on internet forums how to obtain equipment and assemble it into a still. To cut costs, stainless steel vessels are often replaced with plastic stills, vessels made from polypropylene that can withstand relatively high heat.

====Catalysts====

=====Pyrolysis=====

======THC======
Conversion of CBD to THC can occur with heat acting as a catalyst.

===By contamination===

====Alcoholic drinks====
Alcoholic drinks that are known to be contaminated.

* Diethylene glycol, used dangerously by some winemakers in sweet wines

=====Moonshine=====
====Black tar heroin====
Black tar heroin is a free base form of heroin that is sticky like tar or hard like coal. Its dark color is the result of crude processing methods that leave behind impurities.

Black tar as a type holds a variable admixture morphine derivatives—predominantly 6-MAM (&quot;6-monoacetylmorphine&quot;) which is another result of crude acetylation. The lack of proper reflux during acetylation fails to remove much of the moisture retained in the acetylating agent, glacial acetic acid.

====Contaminated cocaine====

=====Black cocaine=====
Black cocaine () is a mixture of regular cocaine base or cocaine hydrochloride with various other substances.

=====Cocaine paste=====
Coca paste (paco, basuco, oxi) is a crude extract of the coca leaf which contains 40% to 91% cocaine freebase along with companion coca alkaloids and varying quantities of benzoic acid, methanol, and kerosene.

====Krokodil====
Illicitly produced desomorphine is typically far from pure and often contains large amounts of toxic substances and contaminants as a result of being &quot;cooked&quot; and used without any significant effort to remove the byproducts and leftovers from synthesis. Injecting any such mixture can cause serious damage to the skin, blood vessels, bone and muscles, sometimes requiring limb amputation in long-term users. Its melting point is 189 °C.

Causes of this damage are from iodine, phosphorus and other toxic substances that are present after synthesis.

====Methamphetamine====

A common adulterant is dimethyl sulfone, a solvent and cosmetic base without known effect on the nervous system; other adulterants include dimethylamphetamine HCl, ephedrine HCl, sodium thiosulfate, sodium chloride, sodium glutamate, and a mixture of caffeine with sodium benzoate.

Although the prevalence of domestic meth labs continues to be high in western states, they have spread throughout the United States. It has been suggested that &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; meth production in rural areas is reflective of a broader DIY approach that includes activities such as hunting, fishing, and fixing one’s cars, trucks, equipment, and house. Toxic chemicals resulting from methamphetamine production may be hoarded or clandestinely dumped, damaging land, water, plant life and wild life, and posing a risk to humans. Waste from methamphetamine labs is frequently dumped on federal, public, and tribal lands. The chemicals involved can explode and clandestine chemistry has been implicated in both house and wild land fires.
In Oregon, Brett Sherry of the Oregon Clandestine Drug Lab Cleanup Program has been quoted as stating that only 10–20% of drug labs are discovered by police.
Statistics reporting the prevalence of meth labs and arrest of meth producers can vary greatly from county to county and state to state. Factors affecting policing and reporting include funding, specialized training, support from local residents, and willingness to make the issue a priority in policing. How information is categorized and tracked may also inflate or minimize the apparent results. 

Missouri has reported some of the highest rates of meth-lab arrests in the country, and has pursued an aggressive and highly publicized policy of policing meth labs. This has resulted in as many as 205 cases per year in one county. In contrast, West Virginia reports and/or prosecutes very few cases. It&#x27;s possible that these low numbers are because of cost. 

In WV, a police agency which reports a meth lab is responsible for the cost its cleanup—which can cost tens of thousands of dollars, as proper disposal of toxic and hazardous materials is very expensive. The high cost of cleanup is a clear disincentive for all agencies, but especially those with limited budgets. 

In 2016, Michigan reported an increase in incidents following the formation of the Midland County Methamphetamine Protocol Team in 2015. However, many of the cases reported involved meth users making small amounts of the drug using a crude and dangerous &quot;one-pot method&quot;. These small operations were for both personal use and for sale to others.

The DEA&#x27;s El Paso Intelligence Center data from 2012 to 2014 is showing a downward trend in the number of clandestine methamphetamine labs; down from a high of 15,196 in 2010. Drug seizure quantities, on the other hand, are steadily increasing since 2007, according to data from the DEA&#x27;s System to Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence (STRIDE) (see table to the right).

=====Cleanup=====

Clean up processes were regulated by the EPA as of 2007. The Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2007 required EPA to develop guidelines for remediation of former methamphetamine labs. This creates guidelines for States and local agencies to improve &quot;our national understanding of identifying the point at which former methamphetamine laboratories become clean enough to inhabit again.&quot; The legislation also required that EPA periodically update the guidelines, as appropriate, to reflect the best available knowledge and research.
Making a former meth lab site safer for habitation requires two basic efforts:
;Gross chemical removal: This is the process in which law enforcement or a Drug Enforcement Administration contractors removes the obvious dangers from the site. Obvious dangers include containers of chemicals, equipment, and apparatus that could be used to make illegal drugs, drug paraphernalia, and other illegal items. This process does not cleanup or remove chemical spills, stains or residue that could be harmful to inhabitants. A property that has had only a gross chemical removal is not fit for habitation. 
;Clandestine remediation: The cleaning of interior structures and, if applicable, the surrounding land, surface waters and groundwater by an EPA approved or National Crime Scene Cleanup Association certified company. This is the process of removing the residue and waste from the site after the gross chemical removal is done. A property that has been remediated should present minimal to no health risk to occupants.

====MPPP====
MPTP may be accidentally produced during the manufacture of MPPP. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), a metabolite of MPTP, causes rapid onset of irreversible symptoms similar to Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

====PCP====
Embalming fluid has been found as a by-product of PCP manufacture. Marijuana cigarettes dipped in embalming fluid, sometimes also laced with PCP are known as &quot;fry&quot; or &quot;fry sticks&quot;.

==Explosives==
Clandestine chemistry is not limited to drugs; it is also associated with explosives, and other illegal chemicals. Of the explosives manufactured illegally, nitroglycerin and acetone peroxide are easiest to produce due to the ease with which the precursors can be acquired.

Uncle Fester is a writer who commonly writes about different aspects of clandestine chemistry. &quot;Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture&quot; is among his most popular books, and is considered required reading for DEA agents. More of his books deal with other aspects of clandestine chemistry, including explosives, and poisons. Fester is, however, considered by many to be a faulty and unreliable source for information in regard to the clandestine manufacture of chemicals.

<doc id="610336" wikidata="Q1066745" url="?curid=610336" title="Irish phonology">
<text>Irish [[phonology]] varies from dialect to dialect; there is no standard pronunciation of Irish. Therefore, this article focuses on phenomena shared by most or all dialects, and on the major differences among the dialects. Detailed discussion of the dialects can be found in the specific articles: Ulster Irish, Connacht Irish, and Munster Irish.

Irish phonology has been studied as a discipline since the late 19th century, with numerous researchers publishing descriptive accounts of dialects from all regions where the language is spoken. More recently, Irish phonology has been a focus of theoretical linguists.

One of the most important aspects of Irish phonology is that almost all consonants (except ) come in pairs, a &quot;broad&quot; and a &quot;slender&quot; pronunciation. Broad consonants are either velarized (◌ˠ; back of tongue is pulled back and slightly up in the direction of the soft palate during articulation) or simply velar (for example, ). Slender consonants are palatalized (◌ʲ; tongue pushed up towards the hard palate during articulation). The contrast between broad and slender consonants is crucial in Irish, because the meaning of a word can change if a broad consonant is substituted for a slender consonant or vice versa. For example, the only difference in pronunciation between the words (&#x27;cow&#x27;) and (&#x27;alive&#x27;) is that is pronounced with broad , while is pronounced with slender . The contrast between broad and slender consonants plays a critical role not only in distinguishing the individual consonants themselves, but also in the pronunciation of the surrounding vowels, in the determination of which consonants can stand next to each other, and in the behaviour of words that begin with a vowel. This broad/slender distinction is similar to the hard/soft one of several Slavic languages, like Russian.

Irish shares a number of phonological characteristics with its nearest linguistic relatives, Scottish Gaelic and Manx, as well as with Hiberno-English, which it currently has the most language contact with.

==History of the discipline==

Until the end of the 19th century, linguistic discussions of Irish focused either on the traditional grammar (issues like the inflection of nouns, verbs and adjectives) or on the historical development of sounds from Proto-Indo-European through Proto-Celtic to Old Irish. The first descriptive analysis of the phonology of an Irish dialect was , which was based on the author&#x27;s fieldwork in the Aran Islands. This was followed by , a phonetic description of the dialect of Meenawannia near Glenties, County Donegal. is predominantly a historical account, but has some description of modern dialects as well. Alf Sommerfelt published early descriptions of Ulster dialects ( and for the village of Torr in Gweedore, , and for the now extinct dialect of South Armagh). The dialect of Dunquin on the Dingle Peninsula in Munster was described by . From 1944 to 1968 the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies published a series of monographs, each describing the phonology of one local dialect: for West Muskerry in County Cork (Ballyvourney, Coolea and vicinity), (first published 1945) for Cois Fhairrge in County Galway (Barna, Spiddal, Inverin and vicinity), for An Rinn in County Waterford, for Tourmakeady in County Mayo, for Teelin, County Donegal, for Erris in County Mayo. More recent descriptive phonology has been published by for Rosguill in northern Donegal, for Tangaveane and Commeen (also near Glenties), for Iorras Aithneach in Connemara (Kilkieran and vicinity) and for the Dingle Peninsula, County Kerry.

Research into the theoretical phonology of Irish began with , which follows the principles and practices of Chomsky and Halle&#x27;s &quot;The Sound Pattern of English&quot; and which formed the basis of the phonology sections of . Dissertations examining Irish phonology from a theoretical point of view include , in optimality theory, and and in government phonology.

==Consonants==
Most dialects of Irish contain at a minimum the consonant phonemes shown in the following chart (see International Phonetic Alphabet for an explanation of the symbols). The consonant is neither broad nor slender.

===On- and offglides===
Broad (velar or velarized) consonants have a noticeable velar offglide (; a very short vowel-like sound) before front vowels, which sounds like the English but without rounding. Thus (&#x27;nine&#x27;) and (&#x27;way, manner&#x27;) are pronounced and , respectively. This velar offglide is labialized (pronounced [w]) after labial consonants, so (&#x27;yellow&#x27;) is pronounced .

Similarly, slender (palatal or palatalised) consonants have a palatal offglide (; like English ) before back vowels, e.g. (&#x27;thick&#x27;) is pronounced .

When a broad consonant follows a front vowel, there is a very short vowel sound (called an onglide) just before the consonant, e.g. (&#x27;sell&#x27;) is pronounced . Similarly, when a slender consonant follows a back vowel, there is an onglide before the consonant, e.g. (&#x27;place&#x27;) is pronounced , (&#x27;drinking&#x27; gen.) is pronounced , (&#x27;understanding&#x27;) is , and (&#x27;to us&#x27;) is .

These all are also a feature of certain Slavic languages such as Russian, and a feature of Lithuanian.

===Allophones===
 (written as ) has two basic allophones: the labiovelar approximant and the velarized voiced labiodental fricative . The distribution of these allophones varies from dialect to dialect. In Munster, generally only is found, and in Ulster generally only is found. In Connacht, is found word-initially before vowels (e.g. &#x27;is&#x27;) and in other positions (e.g. &#x27;saint&#x27;, &#x27;autumn&#x27;, and &#x27;hurried&#x27;).

The remaining labial fricatives are typically labiodental , but they as well as the fricative allophone of have bilabial allophones in many dialects; the distribution depends partly on environment (bilabials are more likely to be found adjacent to rounded vowels) and partly on the individual speaker.

Most coronals are alveolar, except broad stops and approximants which are typically dental , and the slender fricative is typically postalveolar . may be realized as alveolo-palatal affricates in a number of dialects, including Tourmakeady, Erris, and Teelin.

 may be true palatals or palatovelars .

 has three allophones in most dialects: a palatal approximant before vowels (except ) and syllable-finally (e.g. &#x27;nice&#x27;, &#x27;will be&#x27;); a voiced (post)palatal fricative before consonants (e.g. &#x27;sun&#x27;); and an intermediate sound (with more frication than but less frication than ) before (e.g. &#x27;straightened&#x27;).

 has the primary allophone .

In many varieties, and alternate with under a variety of circumstances. For example, as the lenition of and , is replaced by before back vowels, e.g. (&#x27;I would give&#x27;), (&#x27;drove&#x27;). In Munster, becomes after a vowel, e.g. (&#x27;twenty&#x27;). In Ring, final becomes in monosyllabic words, e.g. (&#x27;fear&#x27;). In some Ulster varieties, e.g. Tory Island, can be replaced by , e.g. (&#x27;not&#x27;), be deleted word-finally or before , e.g. (&#x27;greedy&#x27;) and (&#x27;seven&#x27;).

As in English, voiceless stops are aspirated (articulated with a puff of air immediately upon release) at the start of a word, while voiced stops may be incompletely voiced but are never aspirated. Voiceless stops are unaspirated after and (e.g. &#x27;terror&#x27;); however, stops remain aspirated after the clitic &quot;is&quot; (e.g. &#x27;it&#x27;s crooked&#x27;). Several researchers (e.g. , , , , and ) use transcriptions like , etc., indicating they consider the stops that occur after voiceless fricatives to be devoiced allophones of the voiced stops rather than unaspirated allophones of the voiceless stops, but this is a minority view.

===Fortis and lenis sonorants===
In Old Irish, the sonorants (those spelled ) were divided not only into broad and slender types, but also into fortis and lenis types. The precise phonetic definition of these terms is somewhat vague, but the coronal fortis sounds (spelled ) were probably longer in duration and may have had a larger area of contact between the tongue and the roof of the mouth than the lenis sounds. Fortis was probably a normal , while lenis was a nasalized semivowel , perhaps tending towards a nasalized fricative or when palatalized. By convention, the fortis coronals are transcribed with small capital letters or capital letters , the lenis with lower case (some authors, such as , instead use Latin for fortis and Greek for lenis). Thus Old Irish had four rhotic phonemes , four lateral phonemes , and four coronal nasal phonemes . Fortis and lenis sonorants contrasted with each other between vowels and word-finally after vowels in Old Irish, e.g. (&#x27;he shears&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;he may carry&#x27;); (&#x27;hazel&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;sin&#x27;); (&#x27;stake&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;sound&#x27;). Word-initially, only the fortis sounds were found, but they became lenis in environments where morphosyntactically triggered lenition was found: (&#x27;mystery&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;his mystery&#x27;), (&#x27;provision&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;his provision&#x27;).

In the modern language, the four rhotics have been reduced to two in all dialects, having merged as . For the laterals and nasals, some dialects have kept all four distinct, while others have reduced them to three or two distinct phonemes, as summarized in the following table.

As for fortis and lenis , in time the lenis version (nasalized semivowel or labial fricative) came to be pronounced as a regular semivowel or fricative along with nasalization of the preceding vowel. The later loss of between vowels has resulted in phonemically nasalized vowels in some modern dialects (see below), but these are not robustly maintained in any dialect; the strong tendency is to eliminate the nasalization entirely. The original nasalized semivowel is still reflected as in the spelling, however.

==Vowels==


The vowel sounds vary from dialect to dialect, but in general Connacht and Munster at least agree in having the monophthongs , , , , , , , , , , and schwa (), which is found only in unstressed syllables; and the diphthongs , , , and .

The vowels of Ulster Irish are more divergent and are not discussed in this article.

===Vowel backness===
The backness of vowels (that is, the horizontal position of the highest point of the tongue) depends to a great extent on the quality (broad or slender) of adjacent consonants. Some researchers (e.g. , , ) have argued that and are actually allophones of the same phoneme, as are and , as in a vertical vowel system. Under this view, these phonemes are not marked at an abstract level as either front vowels or back vowels. Rather, they acquire a specification for frontness or backness from the consonants around them. In this article, however, the more traditional assumption that are four distinct phonemes will be followed. The descriptions of the allophones in this section come from ; the pronunciations therefore reflect the Munster accent of the Dingle Peninsula. Unless otherwise noted, however, they largely hold for other Munster and Connacht accents as well.

====Close vowels====
The four close vowel phonemes of Irish are the fully close and , and the near-close and . Their exact pronunciation depends on the quality of the surrounding consonants. is realized as a front between two slender consonants (e.g. &#x27;country&#x27;). Between a slender and a broad consonant, the tongue is retracted slightly from this position (for which the IPA symbol is ), e.g. (&#x27;sale&#x27;), (&#x27;berry&#x27; gen.). Between two broad consonants, the tongue is retracted even further, almost to the point of being a central vowel (in IPA, ): (&#x27;sheep&#x27;). is a fully back between broad consonants (e.g. &#x27;fort&#x27;), but between a broad and a slender consonant, the tongue is somewhat advanced (IPA ), e.g. (&#x27;three people&#x27;), (&#x27;eye&#x27;). Between two slender consonants, it is advanced even further, to a centralized vowel (IPA ): (&#x27;quiet&#x27;).
The near-close vowels and show a similar pattern. is realized between slender consonants as a front , e.g. (&#x27;house&#x27; dat.). After a slender consonant and before a broad one, it is a near-front , e.g. (&#x27;piece&#x27;). After a broad consonant and before a slender one, it is a more retracted , e.g. (&#x27;understands&#x27;). Finally, between two broad consonants it is a central , e.g. (&#x27;salty&#x27;). is a near-back when all adjacent consonants are broad, e.g. (&#x27;black&#x27;), and a more centralized after a slender consonant, e.g. (&#x27;rag&#x27;).

====Mid vowels====

The realization of the long close-mid vowels and varies according to the quality of the surrounding consonants. is a front between two slender consonants (e.g. &#x27;yell&#x27;), a centralized between a broad and a slender consonant (e.g. &#x27;call&#x27;), and a more open centralized between two broad consonants (e.g. &#x27;danger&#x27;). ranges from a back between two broad consonants (e.g. &#x27;turf&#x27;) to an advanced between a broad and a slender consonant (e.g. &#x27;turf&#x27; [gen.]) to a centralized between two slender consonants (e.g. &#x27;music&#x27; [gen.]).

The short open-mid vowels also vary depending on their environment. Short ranges from a front between slender consonants (e.g. &#x27;will be&#x27;) to a retracted between a broad and a slender consonant (e.g. &#x27;I will be&#x27;, &#x27;was&#x27;) to a central when the only adjacent consonant is broad (e.g. &#x27;cross&#x27; [dat.]). Short between two broad consonants is usually a back , e.g. (&#x27;stone&#x27;), but it is a centralized adjacent to nasal consonants and labial consonants, e.g. (&#x27;there&#x27;) and (&#x27;soft&#x27;). Between a broad and a slender consonant, it is a more open : (&#x27;school&#x27;), (&#x27;drink&#x27;).

=====Schwa=====

Unstressed is realized as a near-close, near-front when adjacent to a palatal consonant, e.g. (&#x27;pike&#x27;). Next to other slender consonants, it is a mid-centralized , e.g. (&#x27;salt water&#x27;). Adjacent to broad consonants, it is usually a mid central , e.g. (&#x27;information&#x27;), but when the preceding syllable contains one of the close back vowels , it is realized as a mid-centralized back , e.g. (&#x27;closing&#x27;), (&#x27;pigs&#x27;).

====Open vowels====

The realization of the open vowels varies according to the quality of the surrounding consonants; there is a significant difference between Munster dialects and Connacht dialects as well. In Munster, long and short have approximately the same range of realization: both vowels are relatively back in contact with broad consonants and relatively front in contact with slender consonants. Specifically, long in word-initial position and after broad consonants is a back , e.g. (&#x27;place&#x27;), (&#x27;beach&#x27;). Between a slender and a broad consonant, it is a retracted front , e.g. (&#x27;will cut&#x27;), while between two slender consonants it is a fully front , e.g. (&#x27;John&#x27; voc.). In Dingle, the back allophone is rounded to after broad labials, e.g. (&#x27;white&#x27;), while in Ring, County Waterford, rounded is the usual realization of in all contexts except between slender consonants, where it is a centralized . Short between two slender consonants is a front , as in (&#x27;short&#x27;). Between a broad and a slender consonant, it is in most cases a retracted , e.g. (&#x27;man&#x27;), and (&#x27;worn&#x27;), but after broad labials and it is a centralized front , e.g. (&#x27;town&#x27;), (&#x27;injure&#x27;). When it is adjacent only to broad consonants, it is a centralized back , e.g. (&#x27;son&#x27;), (&#x27;say&#x27;).
In Connacht varieties, the allophones of short are consistently further front than the allophones of long . In Erris, for example, short ranges from a near-open front vowel before slender consonants (e.g. &#x27;earwax&#x27;) to an open after slender consonants (e.g. &#x27;bright&#x27;) to a centralized back between broad consonants (e.g. &#x27;horse&#x27;). Long , on the other hand, ranges from a back between broad consonants (e.g. &#x27;boat&#x27;) to an advanced back before slender consonants (e.g. &#x27;to get&#x27;) to a centralized back after slender consonants (e.g. &#x27;fine&#x27;). In Toormakeady, the back allophone is rounded to after broad labials, e.g. (&#x27;white&#x27;). In Connemara, the allophones of are lengthened in duration, so that only vowel quality distinguishes the allophones of from those of .

====Diphthongs====

The starting point of ranges from a near-open central after broad consonants to an open-mid centralized front after slender consonants, and its end point ranges from a near-close near-front before slender consonants to a centralized before broad consonants. Examples include (&#x27;rogue&#x27;), (&#x27;dog&#x27;), (&#x27;church&#x27;), and (&#x27;cure&#x27;).

The starting point of ranges from a near-open central after broad consonants to an open-mid advanced central after slender consonants, and its end point ranges from a near-close near-back before broad consonants to a centralized before slender consonants. Examples include (&#x27;deaf&#x27;), (&#x27;improvement&#x27;), (&#x27;speak&#x27;), and (&#x27;memory&#x27;). In West Muskerry and the Dingle Peninsula, however, the starting point of is rounded and further back after broad consonants, e.g. (&#x27;goat&#x27;).
The starting point of ranges from a close front after slender consonants to a retracted after word-initial broad (the only context in which it appears after a broad consonant). Its end point ranges from a mid central before broad consonants to a close-mid centralized front before slender consonants. Examples include (&#x27;sense&#x27;), (&#x27;ever&#x27;), and (&#x27;devils&#x27;).

The starting point of is consistently a close back while the end point ranges from to : (&#x27;above&#x27;), (&#x27;lamb&#x27;), (&#x27;strike&#x27;).

===Nasalized vowels===
In general, vowels in Irish are nasalized when adjacent to nasal consonants. For some speakers, there are reported to be minimal pairs between nasal vowels and oral vowels, indicating that nasal vowels are also separate phonemes; these generally result from an earlier nasalized semivowel (historically the lenited version of ), that has since been lost. However, the contrast is not robust in any dialect; most published descriptions say that contrastively nasal vowels are present in the speech of only some (usually older) speakers. Potential minimal pairs include those shown in the table below.

In addition, where a vowel is nasalized because it is adjacent to a nasal consonant, it often retains its nasalization in related forms where the consonant is no longer nasal. For example, the nasal of (&#x27;mother&#x27;) is replaced by nonnasal in the phrase (&#x27;his mother&#x27;), but the vowel remains nasalized. Similarly, in (&#x27;snow&#x27;) the vowel after the is nasalized, while in (&#x27;the snow&#x27; gen.), the is replaced by in some northern dialects, but the nasalized vowel remains.

==Phonotactics==
The most notable aspects of Irish phonotactics revolve around the behaviour of consonant clusters. Here it is important to distinguish between clusters that occur at the beginnings of words and those that occur after vowels, although there is overlap between the two groups.

===Word-initial consonant clusters===
Irish words can begin with clusters of two or three consonants. In general, all the consonants in a cluster agree in their quality, i.e. either all are broad or all are slender. Two-consonant clusters consist of an obstruent consonant followed by a liquid or nasal consonant (however, labial obstruents may not be followed by a nasal); examples (from ) include (&#x27;milking&#x27;), (&#x27;fine&#x27;), (&#x27;button&#x27;), (&#x27;law&#x27;), (&#x27;usual&#x27;), (&#x27;idiot&#x27;), (&#x27;slice&#x27;), (&#x27;snow&#x27;), (&#x27;poker&#x27;), and (&#x27;long for&#x27;). In addition, and may be followed by a voiceless stop, as in (&#x27;purse&#x27;) and (&#x27;story&#x27;). Further, the cluster occurs in the word (&#x27;women&#x27;) and a few forms related to it. Three-consonant clusters consist of or plus a voiceless stop plus a liquid. Examples include (&#x27;rumpus&#x27;), (&#x27;scream&#x27;), (&#x27;flash&#x27;), (&#x27;fun&#x27;), and (&#x27;streak&#x27;).

One exception to quality agreement is that broad is found before slender labials (and for some speakers in Connemara and Dingle before as well). Examples include: (&#x27;berries&#x27;), (&#x27;scythe&#x27;), (&#x27;dependent&#x27;), (&#x27;inspire&#x27;), and (&#x27;story&#x27;).

In the environment of an initial consonant mutation, there is a much wider range of possible onset clusters; for example, in a lenition environment the following occur: (&#x27;tasted&#x27;), (&#x27;broke&#x27;), (&#x27;practiced&#x27;), (&#x27;bent&#x27;), (&#x27;stuck&#x27;), (&#x27;acted&#x27;), (&#x27;slipped&#x27;), (&#x27;swam&#x27;), (&#x27;reached&#x27;). In an eclipsis environment, the following are found: (&#x27;flower&#x27;), (&#x27;years&#x27;), (&#x27;you would break&#x27;), (&#x27;warp&#x27;), (&#x27;bridge&#x27;), (&#x27;ladder&#x27;), (&#x27;you would dress&#x27;), (&#x27;you would leave&#x27;), (&#x27;you would act&#x27;).

In Donegal, Mayo, and Connemara dialects (but not usually on the Aran Islands), the coronal nasals can follow only respectively in a word-initial cluster. After other consonants, they are replaced by : (&#x27;hill&#x27;), (&#x27;women&#x27;), (&#x27;liking&#x27;), (&#x27;long for&#x27;).

Under lenition, become as expected in these dialects, but after the definite article &quot;an&quot; they become : (&#x27;snow&#x27;), (&#x27;snow&#x27; [lenited form]), (&#x27;the snow&#x27; gen.).

===Post-vocalic consonant clusters and epenthesis===

Like word-initial consonant clusters, post-vocalic consonant clusters usually agree in broad or slender quality. The only exception here is that broad , not slender , appears before the slender coronals : (&#x27;two people&#x27;), (&#x27;trade&#x27;), (&#x27;doors&#x27;), (&#x27;handle&#x27;), (&#x27;advice&#x27;).

A cluster of , , or followed by a labial or dorsal consonant (except the voiceless stops , ) is broken up by an epenthetic vowel : (&#x27;abrupt&#x27;), (&#x27;blue&#x27;), (&#x27;mistake&#x27;), (&#x27;certain&#x27;), (&#x27;service&#x27;), (&#x27;anger&#x27;), (&#x27;dark&#x27;), (&#x27;bold&#x27;), (&#x27;dove&#x27;), (&#x27;pleasant&#x27;), (&#x27;sparrow&#x27;), (&#x27;venom&#x27;), , (a name for Ireland), (&#x27;name&#x27;), (&#x27;mind&#x27;), (&#x27;animal&#x27;).

There is no epenthesis, however, if the vowel preceding the cluster is long or a diphthong: (&#x27;wrinkle&#x27;), (&#x27;term&#x27;), (&#x27;insight&#x27;), (&#x27;duty&#x27;). There is also no epenthesis into words that are at least three syllables long: (&#x27;firmament&#x27;), (&#x27;throat&#x27;), (&#x27;dandelion&#x27;), (&#x27;Carmelite&#x27;).

==Phonological processes==

===Vowel-initial words===
Vowel-initial words in Irish exhibit behaviour that has led linguists to suggest that the vowel sound they begin with on the surface is not actually the first sound in the word at a more abstract level. Specifically, when a clitic ending in a consonant precedes a word beginning with the vowel, the consonant of the clitic surfaces as either broad or slender, depending on the specific word in question. For example, the of the definite article (&#x27;the&#x27;) is slender before the word (&#x27;wonder&#x27;) but broad before the word (&#x27;age&#x27;): (&#x27;the wonder&#x27; gen.) vs. (&#x27;the age&#x27;).

One analysis of these facts is that vowel-initial words actually begin, at an abstract level of representation, with a kind of &quot;empty&quot; consonant that consists of nothing except the information &quot;broad&quot; or &quot;slender&quot;. Another analysis is that vowel-initial words, again at an abstract level, all begin with one of two semivowels, one triggering palatalization and the other triggering velarization of a preceding consonant.

===Lengthening before fortis sonorants===
Where reflexes of the Old Irish fortis sonorants appear in syllable-final position (in some cases, only in word-final position), they trigger a lengthening or diphthongization of the preceding vowel in most dialects of Irish. The details vary from dialect to dialect.

In Donegal and Mayo, lengthening is found only before , before (except when a vowel follows), and in a few words also before word-final , e.g. (&#x27;top&#x27;), (&#x27;tall&#x27;), (&#x27;inch&#x27;), (&#x27;spinning wheel&#x27;), (&#x27;yonder&#x27;).

In Connemara, the Aran Islands, and Munster, lengthening is found generally not only in the environments listed above, but also before (unless a vowel follows) and before word-final . For example, the word (&#x27;hole&#x27;) is pronounced in all of these regions, while (&#x27;grip&#x27;) is pronounced in Connemara and Aran and in Munster.

Because vowels behave differently before broad sonorants than before slender ones in many cases, and because there is generally no lengthening (except by analogy) when the sonorants are followed by a vowel, there is a variety of vowel alternations between different related word-forms. For example, in Dingle (&#x27;head&#x27;) is pronounced with a diphthong, but (the genitive singular of the same word) is pronounced with a long vowel, while (the plural, meaning &#x27;heads&#x27;) is pronounced with a short vowel.

This lengthening has received a number of different explanations within the context of theoretical phonology. All accounts agree that some property of the fortis sonorant is being transferred to the preceding vowel, but the details about what property that is vary from researcher to researcher. argue that the fortis sonorant is tense (a term only vaguely defined phonetically) and that this tenseness is transferred to the vowel, where it is realized phonetically as vowel length and/or diphthongization. argues that the triggering consonant is underlyingly associated with a unit of syllable weight called a &quot;mora&quot;; this mora then shifts to the vowel, creating a long vowel or a diphthong. expands on that analysis to argue that the fortis sonorants have an advanced tongue root (that is, the bottom of the tongue is pushed upward during articulation of the consonant) and that diphthongization is an articulatory effect of this tongue movement.

===Devoicing===
Where a voiced obstruent or comes into contact with , the is absorbed into the other sound, which then becomes voiceless (in the case of , devoicing is to ). Devoicing is found most prominently in the future of first conjugation verbs (where is spelled ) and in the formation of verbal adjectives (where is spelled ). For example, the verb (&#x27;sweep&#x27;) ends in the voiced consonant , but its future tense (&#x27;will sweep&#x27;) and verbal adjective (&#x27;swept&#x27;) have the voiceless consonant .

===Sandhi===
Irish exhibits a number of external sandhi effects, i.e. phonological changes across word boundaries, particularly in rapid speech. The most common type of sandhi in Irish is assimilation, which means that a sound changes its pronunciation in order to become more similar to an adjacent sound. One type of assimilation in Irish is found when a coronal consonant () changes from being broad to being slender before a word that begins with a slender coronal consonant and vice versa. For example, (&#x27;deceive&#x27;) ends with a broad , but in the phrase (&#x27;it deceived me&#x27;), the has become slender because the following word, , starts with a slender coronal consonant.

 may also assimilate to the place of articulation of a following consonant, becoming labial before a labial consonant, palatal before a palatal consonant, and velar before a velar consonant. For example, of (&#x27;one&#x27;) becomes in (&#x27;a lame one&#x27;) and in (&#x27;a scabbed one&#x27;). A voiced consonant at the end of a word may devoice when the next word begins with a voiceless consonant, as in (&#x27;he bent&#x27;), where of (&#x27;bent&#x27;) became before the voiceless of .

==Stress==

===General facts of stress placement===
In Irish, words normally have only one stressed syllable (ˈ◌), namely the first syllable of the word, e.g. (&#x27;left&#x27; [verb]) and (&#x27;dishonor&#x27;). However, certain words, especially adverbs and loanwords, have stress on a noninitial syllable, e.g. (&#x27;only&#x27;), (&#x27;tobacco&#x27;).

In most compound words, primary stress falls on the first member and a secondary stress (ˌ◌) falls on the second member, e.g. (&#x27;spent bog&#x27;). Some compounds, however, have primary stress on both the first and the second member, e.g. (&#x27;a terrible lie&#x27;).

In Munster, stress is attracted to a long vowel or diphthong in the second or third syllable of a word, e.g. (&#x27;girl&#x27;), (&#x27;request&#x27;). In the now-extinct accent of East Mayo, stress was attracted to a long vowel or diphthong in the same way as in Munster; in addition, stress was attracted to a short vowel before word-final when that word was also final in its utterance. For example, (&#x27;horse&#x27;) was pronounced in isolation or as the last word of a sentence, but as in the middle of a sentence.

In Munster, stress is attracted to in the second syllable of a word if it is followed by , &quot;provided&quot; the first syllable (and third syllable, if there is one) contains a short vowel. Examples include (&#x27;lame&#x27;) and (&#x27;chips&#x27;). However, if the first or third syllable contains a long vowel or diphthong, stress is attracted to that syllable instead, and the before is reduced to as normal, e.g. (&#x27;listen&#x27;), (&#x27;wether&#x27;).

===The nature of unstressed vowels===
In general, short vowels are all reduced to schwa () in unstressed syllables, but there are exceptions. In Munster, if the third syllable of a word is stressed and the preceding two syllables are short, the first of the two unstressed syllables is &quot;not&quot; reduced to ; instead it receives a secondary stress, e.g. (&#x27;scythe-man&#x27;). Also in Munster, an unstressed short vowel is not reduced to if the following syllable contains a stressed or , e.g. (&#x27;art&#x27;), (&#x27;gather&#x27;). In Ulster, long vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened but are not reduced to , e.g. (&#x27;girl&#x27;), (&#x27;gallon&#x27;). In Ulster, unstressed before is not reduced to schwa, e.g. (&#x27;cattle&#x27;).

==Comparison with other languages==

===Scottish Gaelic and Manx===

Many of the phonological processes found in Irish are found also in its nearest relatives, Scottish Gaelic and Manx. For example, both languages contrast &quot;broad&quot; and &quot;slender&quot; consonants, but only at the coronal and dorsal places of articulation; both Scottish Gaelic and Manx have lost the distinction in labial consonants. The change of etc. to etc. is found in Manx and most dialects of Scottish Gaelic. Evidence from written manuscripts suggests it had begun in Scottish Gaelic as early as the 16th century and was well established in both Scottish Gaelic and Manx by the late 17th to early 18th century. Lengthening or diphthongization of vowels before fortis sonorants is also found in both languages. The stress pattern of Scottish Gaelic is the same as that in Connacht and Ulster Irish, while in Manx, stress is attracted to long vowels and diphthongs in noninitial syllables, but under more restricted conditions than in Munster.

Manx and many dialects of Scottish Gaelic share with Ulster Irish the property of not reducing unstressed to before .

===Hiberno-English===
Irish pronunciation has had a significant influence on the features of Hiberno-English. For example, most of the vowels of Hiberno-English (with the exception of ) correspond to vowel phones of Irish. The Irish stops are common realizations of the English phonemes . Hiberno-English also allows where it is permitted in Irish but excluded in other dialects of English, such as before an unstressed vowel (e.g. &quot;Haughey&quot; ) and at the end of a word (e.g. &quot;McGrath&quot; ). There is epenthesis in words like &quot;film&quot; and &quot;form&quot; .

<doc id="610337" wikidata="Q1418537" url="?curid=610337" title="Mount Graham">
<text>Mount Graham (called in Nnee biyati&#x27; (Western Apache) Dził Nchaa Sí&#x27;an – &#x27;Big Seated Mountain&#x27;) is a mountain in Graham County, Arizona, United States, approximately northeast of Tucson. The mountain reaches in height. It is the highest elevation in Graham County, Coronado National Forest and the Pinaleño Mountains. It is also the southernmost peak and land area in the continental United States above . As the name &quot;Mount Graham&quot; is often used by locals to refer to the entire mountain range, the peak itself is frequently referred to as &quot;High Peak&quot;. It is twentieth of the 57 ultra-prominent peaks of the lower 48 states, and the first of the five in Arizona.

==Description==
Mount Graham summits are headwaters for numerous perennial streams that tumble through five major botanical zones. Located between the southern Rocky Mountains and Mexico&#x27;s Sierra Madre Occidental, and biologically isolated for millennia, the higher elevations have provided refuge for relict populations of plants and animals with adaptive strategies rooted in Pleistocene ice age environmental conditions. Of particular note are stands of the oldest conifer trees in the U.S. Southwest and associated habitats for threatened and endangered species, especially the Mount Graham Red Squirrel.

Located near the northern limit of the Chiricahua Apache homeland and the southern margins of Western Apache territory, the range is one of the Western Apache&#x27;s four holiest mountains and is considered sacred by all of the region&#x27;s Native peoples. Since a determination by the Keeper of the Register in 2002, Dził Nchaa Sí&#x27;an, as it is known in the Western Apache language, ranks as the largest and most extensive (~330,000 acres) property listed on or formally determined eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1993, the St. Paisius Orthodox Monastery was founded at the base of the mountain.

Mount Graham hosts both species of Arizona native trout – Gila and Apache trout and three species of introduced trout.

==Climate==
==Mount Graham Observatory==
Mount Graham is home to the Mount Graham International Observatory area, where multiple organizations have set up large telescopes in a few separate observatories authorized by a rare peace-time Congressional waiver of U.S. environmental laws.

The United States Congress authorized construction of the observatories on the mountain in 1988, but there has been outcry from the four federally recognized tribes of the Western Apache Nation and Native American groups, who consider the site to be sacred. Environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, also oppose the Mount Graham International Observatory because the higher elevations are the last remaining habitat for the Mount Graham Red Squirrel.

<doc id="610345" wikidata="Q1891231" url="?curid=610345" title="Springer Mountain">
<text>Springer Mountain is a mountain located in the Chattahoochee National Forest on the border of Fannin and Gilmer counties. Located in the Blue Ridge Mountains in northern Georgia, the mountain has an elevation of about . Springer Mountain serves as the southern terminus for the Appalachian and Benton MacKaye trails.

==Name==
The origin of the name of Springer Mountain is unclear. One possible origin was that it was named in honor of William G. Springer, an early settler appointed in 1833 by Governor Wilson Lumpkin to implement legislation to improve conditions for the Indians. Another possibility was that Springer Mountain was named for the first Presbyterian minister to be ordained in Georgia, John Springer, who was ordained in 1790.

The mountain has been called Springer since at least 1910. As late as 1959, some residents of Gilmer County were still calling the peak Penitentiary Mountain. According to the Gilmer County Historical Society, the name was officially changed by the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club (GATC). It is unknown why the mountain was named Penitentiary. There is no known Cherokee name for the mountain.

==Geography==
Springer Mountain is a north–south-trending loaf-shaped mountain located on the border of Gilmer and Fannin counties. The summit has an elevation above mean sea level. Springer Mountain is part of the Blue Ridge Mountains that extend from Georgia to Pennsylvania. Springer Mountain divides the northern and southern extensions of the Blue Ridge in Georgia, with one branch heading northwest to the Cohutta Mountains and the other branch heading southwest to Mount Oglethorpe. Springer Mountain is located inside the Chattahoochee National Forest, as well as the Ed Jenkins National Recreation Area.

The mountain is located about east of Ellijay, northwest of Dahlonega and southwest of Suches. Mount Oglethorpe, the original southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, is located about south of Springer Mountain. Other nearby geographical features include Black Mountain, Tickanetley Creek and Winding Stair Gap.

==Hiking==
===Appalachian Trail===

In 1958, the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail was relocated from Mount Oglethorpe to Springer Mountain. The reason for this relocation was because of increased development around Mount Oglethorpe. Springer Mountain was considered to be less dramatic than Mount Oglethorpe, but because of its remoteness, Springer Mountain was also considered to be less susceptible to development.

One way to climb Springer Mountain is from a parking lot on Forest Service Road 42, located north up the Appalachian Trail from the summit. Hikers desiring to hike north from Springer Mountain would begin by hiking south on the Appalachian Trail before turning around to hike north. At the peak of Springer Mountain is a bronze plaque with the Appalachian Trail logo, a register for hikers to sign, and a benchmark.

In addition to the Appalachian Trail, Springer Mountain can be reached from the south via the Appalachian Approach Trail. The approach trail starts at the visitor center of Amicalola Falls State Park and is in length.

===Benton MacKaye Trail===
Springer Mountain is also home to the southern terminus of the Benton MacKaye Trail. The trailhead for the Benton MacKaye Trail is located around north of the summit.

===Shelters===
The nearest shelter from the summit is the Springer Mountain Shelter, located about north of the summit. A water spring is located near this shelter. Another nearby shelter is the Black Gap Shelter, located about south of the summit on the Appalachian Approach Trail.

<text>Johann Friedrich Naumann (14 February 1780 – 15 August 1857) was a German scientist, engraver, and editor. He is regarded as the founder of scientific ornithology in Europe. He published &quot;The Natural History of German Birds&quot; (1820–1844) and &quot;The Eggs of German Birds&quot; (1818–1828). His father Johann Andreas Naumann (1744–1826) was a naturalist, and his brother Carl Andreas Naumann (1786–1854) was also an ornithologist.

The German ornithological society named its journal &quot;Naumannia&quot;. The lesser kestrel (&quot;Falco naumanni&quot;) is also named for him.

==Biography==
Johann Friedrich Naumann was born in Ziebigk, about 10 km southeast of Köthen, on 14 February 1780, as the son of Johann Andreas Naumann, a well-known natural historian. After attending school at Dessau, he returned home and devoted himself to the study of agriculture, botany, geology, and ornithology. His later work was devoted more exclusively to the ornithology of Germany. In 1822, he published his &quot;Naturgeschichte der Vögel Deutschlands&quot; (13 vols, Leipzig (1822), illustrated with plates Naumann engraved himself. He was also the author of many other ornithological works.

In 1821, Naumann sold his bird collection to Frederick Ferdinand, Duke of Anhalt-Köthen for 2,000 Taler. He was appointed curator of the ducal collection in the Ferdinandsbau in Schloss (Castle) Köthen, which has been accessible to the public since 1835.

<doc id="610349" wikidata="Q1755655" url="?curid=610349" title="Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk">
<text>Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk is the second studio album by Norwegian black metal band Emperor, released on 19 May 1997 through Candlelight Records and Century Black.

== Background ==
The album was recorded in the Grieg Hall in Bergen, Norway.

The opening guitar riff to &quot;Ye Entrancemperium&quot; is taken from an unnamed Mayhem song. As such, Mayhem guitarist Euronymous is credited in the album liner notes, even though he was murdered three years before the album was written and recorded. A recording of this unfinished track can be found on the Mayhem bootleg &quot;Ha Elm Zalag&quot;.

== Release ==

In 1996, the EP &quot;Reverence&quot;, which included the track &quot;The Loss and Curse of Reverence&quot;, was released as a teaser for the album. &quot;Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk&quot; was released on 8 July 1997 through Candlelight Records. At the time of its release, it reached number 28 on Finnish album charts.

In contrast to the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;In the Nightside Eclipse&quot;, &quot;Anthems&quot; showcases a faster, more guitar-driven performance with less usage of keyboards and more clean singing and blast-beat style drumwork. The album&#x27;s musical approach is explained on the back cover, with a quote that reads &quot;Emperor performs Sophisticated Black Metal Art exclusively&quot;. As well, the album&#x27;s lyrical themes began to move away from nature and Satanic elements and began to incorporate more mystical themes.

In 1998, the album was remastered and re-released with the three non-album tracks from &quot;Reverence&quot;. The band made a promotional video for &quot;The Loss and Curse of Reverence&quot;.

== Reception ==
According to Steve Huey from AllMusic, the album is a &quot;magnificently-conceived and executed opus that fulfills all of Emperor&#x27;s promise and ambition. The biggest difference from its predecessor [being] the crisper, clearer production, which allows details in the arrangements to emerge far more readily.&quot;

He added that there&#x27;s greater use of classical flourishes, greater variety in Ihsahn&#x27;s vocals, more audible guitar interplay between Ihsahn and Samoth and more complex and melodic keyboard work. &quot;It definitely builds on the groundwork laid by extreme metal pioneers Celtic Frost and Bathory: the former with its restless experimentalism, and the latter with its determination to create something quintessentially Scandinavian.&quot;

Finally, he concluded: &quot;&quot;Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk&quot; cemented Emperor&#x27;s reputation as black metal&#x27;s greatest band, and Ihsahn as its foremost musical visionary; it also firmly established black metal as an art form that wasn&#x27;t going away any time soon, and opened up a wide range of creative possibilities to the more progressive, eccentric wing of the genre. &quot;In the Nightside Eclipse&quot; might epitomize black metal better than any other album, but divorced from outside context, &quot;Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk&quot; is black metal&#x27;s greatest stand-alone creative achievement.&quot;

In June 2016, &quot;Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk&quot; was inducted into &quot;Decibel Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Hall of Fame, becoming the second Emperor album to be featured in the Decibel Hall of Fame, the first being predecessor &quot;In the Nightside Eclipse&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk&quot; as 57th on their list of &#x27;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.&#x27; In 2018, &quot;Loudwire&quot; named it the best black metal album of all-time. In 2020, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; included it in their list of the top 10 1997 albums.

<text>The Davis Strait (Danish: &quot;Davisstrædet&quot;) is a southern arm of the Arctic Ocean that lies north of the Labrador Sea. It lies between mid-western Greenland and Baffin Island in Nunavut, Canada. To the north is Baffin Bay. The strait was named for the English explorer John Davis (1550–1605), who explored the area while seeking a Northwest Passage. By the 1650s it was used for whale hunting.

==Extent==
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Davis Strait as follows:

&quot;On the North.&quot; The Southern limit of Baffin Bay [The parallel of 70° North between Greenland and Baffin Land].

&quot;On the East.&quot; The Southwest coast of Greenland.

&quot;On the South.&quot; The parallel of 60° North between Greenland and Labrador.

&quot;On the West.&quot; The Eastern limit of the Northwestern Passages South of 70° North [the East coast of Baffin Island to East Bluff, its Southeastern extremity] and of Hudson Strait [A line from East Bluff, the Southeast extreme of Baffin Island (), to Point Meridian, the Western extreme of Lower Savage Islands, along the coast to its Southwestern extreme and thence a line across to the Western extreme of Resolution Island, through its Southwestern shore to Hatton Headland, its Southern point, thence a line to Cape Chidley, Labrador ()].
==Geology==

The Davis Strait is underlain by complex geological features of buried grabens (basins) and ridges, formed by strike-slip faulting of the Ungava Fault Zone during Paleogene times about 45 million to 62 million years ago. The strike-slip faulting transferred plate-tectonic motions in the Labrador Sea to Baffin Bay. It is the world&#x27;s broadest strait.

==Depth==
With a water depth of between one and two thousand meters the strait is substantially shallower than the Labrador Sea to the south.

==Tides==
The strait is famous for its fierce tides that can range from , which discouraged many earlier explorers.

== Oil and gas ==

US Geological Survey has estimated that at least 13% of the world&#x27;s undiscovered oil deposits and 30% of the world&#x27;s undiscovered gas pockets are located in the Arctic, with the seas around Greenland potentially holding large amounts of natural gas and lesser amounts of crude oil and natural gas liquids. This has led Greenland&#x27;s minister and provincial council to offer a large number of off-shore concessions to potential hydrocarbon (oil and gas) extraction. The largest concessions areas are located in seas west of Greenland, primarily the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay, but with several smaller concessions in the Greenland Sea in the east also.

<text>Darediablo is an instrumental rock trio from New York City. They are influenced by 1970s heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath and AC/DC, their bassist/guitarist often wearing an AC/DC T-Shirt. Their catalog of music have all been independent releases on Orchard starting in 2000, with their latest being released on Southern Records main label (2003).

==History==
Darediablo started in 2000 with Jake Garcia (bass guitar), Matthew Holford (Fender Rhodes, organ), and Peter Karp (drums). They later changed drummers after their &quot;Sky Cohete/Subaquatico&quot; double-EP, enlisting Chad Royce for &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;, and &quot;Feeding Frenzy&quot;, as well as for live performances. Jake Garcia also started to play double-neck bass/guitar combo for live performances, and played guitar in addition to bass on &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;. For &quot;Feeding Frenzy&quot;, he played only guitar.

They contributed the song &quot;Shipping &amp; Handling&quot; to the television show &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot;, for February 2004.

==Description==
Darediablo started out as a blend of hard rock, jazz, and stoner rock, but have managed to focus these sounds into a style that is particularly suited to the instruments: an undersized bass (&quot;the Midget&quot;) played with nods to Jake&#x27;s guitar heroes, a Fender Rhodes and Hammond Organ pumped through reams of effects and distortion, and a drummer.

Time Out New York has said, &quot;darediablo is a smoking, sometimes atmospheric, bass-drum-organ trio that comes on like Medeski Martin &amp; Wood with an MC5 fixation.&quot;

<text>The Labrador Sea (; ) is an arm of the North Atlantic Ocean between the Labrador Peninsula and Greenland. The sea is flanked by continental shelves to the southwest, northwest, and northeast. It connects to the north with Baffin Bay through the Davis Strait. It is a marginal sea of the Atlantic.

The sea formed upon separation of the North American Plate and Greenland Plate that started about 60 million years ago and stopped about 40 million years ago. It contains one of the world&#x27;s largest turbidity current channel systems, the Northwest Atlantic Mid-Ocean Channel (NAMOC), that runs for thousands of kilometers along the sea bottom toward the Atlantic Ocean.

The Labrador Sea is a major source of the North Atlantic Deep Water, a cold water mass that flows at great depth along the western edge of the North Atlantic.
==History==
The Labrador Sea formed upon separation of the North American Plate and Greenland Plate that started about 60 million years ago (Paleocene) and stopped about 40 million years ago. A sedimentary basin, which is now buried under the continental shelves, formed during the Cretaceous. Onset of magmatic sea-floor spreading was accompanied by volcanic eruptions of picrites and basalts in the Paleocene at the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay.

Between about 500 BC and 1300 AD, the southern coast of the sea contained Dorset, Beothuk, and Inuit settlements; Dorset tribes were later replaced by Thule people.

==Extent==

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Labrador Sea as follows:
On the North: the South limit of Davis Strait [The parallel of 60° North between Greenland and Labrador].

On the East: a line from Cape St. Francis (Newfoundland) to Cape Farewell (Greenland).

On the West: the East Coast of Labrador and Newfoundland and the Northeast limit of the Gulf of St. Lawrence – a line running from Cape Bauld (North point of Kirpon Island, ) to the East extreme of Belle Isle and on to the Northeast Ledge (). Thence a line joining this ledge with the East extreme of Cape St. Charles (52°13&#x27;N) in Labrador.

Natural Resources Canada uses a slightly different definition, putting the northern boundary of the Labrador Sea on a straight line from a headland on Killiniq Island abutting Lady Job Harbour to Cape Farewell.

==Oceanography==

The Labrador Sea is about deep and wide where it joins the Atlantic Ocean. It becomes shallower, to less than towards Baffin Bay (see depth map) and passes into the wide Davis Strait. A deep turbidity current channel system, which is about wide and long, runs on the bottom of the sea, near its center from the Hudson Strait into the Atlantic. It is called the Northwest Atlantic Mid-Ocean Channel (NAMOC) and is one of the world&#x27;s longest drainage systems of Pleistocene age. It appears as a submarine river bed with numerous tributaries and is maintained by high-density turbidity currents flowing within the levees.

The water temperature varies between in winter and in summer. The salinity is relatively low, at 31–34.9 parts per thousand. Two-thirds of the sea is covered in ice in winter. Tides are semi-diurnal (i.e. occur twice a day), reaching .

There is an anticlockwise water circulation in the sea. It is initiated by the East Greenland Current and continued by the West Greenland Current, which brings warmer, more saline waters northwards, along the Greenland coasts up to the Baffin Bay. Then, the Baffin Island Current and Labrador Current transport cold and less saline water southward along the Canadian coast. These currents carry numerous icebergs and therefore hinder navigation and exploration of the gas fields beneath the sea bed. The speed of the Labrador current is typically , but can reach in some areas, whereas the Baffin Current is somewhat slower at about . The Labrador Current maintains the water temperature at and salinity between 30 and 34 parts per thousand.

The sea provides a significant part of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) — a cold water mass that flows at great depth along the western edge of the North Atlantic, spreading out to form the largest identifiable water mass in the World Ocean. The NADW consists of three parts of different origin and salinity, and the top one, the Labrador Sea Water (LSW), is formed in the Labrador Sea. This part occurs at a medium depth and has a relatively low salinity (34.84–34.89 parts per thousand), low temperature () and high oxygen content compared to the layers above and below it. LSW also has a relatively low vorticity, i.e. the tendency to form vortices, than any other water in North Atlantic that reflects its high homogeneity. It has a potential density of 27.76–27.78 mg/cm3 relatively to the surface layers, meaning it is denser, and thus sinks under the surface and remains homogeneous and unaffected by the surface fluctuations.

==Fauna==
The northern and western parts of the Labrador Sea are covered in ice between December and June. This drift ice serves as a breeding ground for several types of pinnipeds (including Atlantic walrus and bearded, grey, harbor, harp, hooded and ringed seals). Several cetacean species feed in these abundant waters in early spring, including blue, fin, humpback, long-finned pilot, minke, North Atlantic right, sei and sperm whales. The sea contains one of the two primary populations of sei whales, the other being the Scotian Shelf. Pods of beluga (white) whales are more common further to the north, west and south (notably in Baffin Bay, where their population reaches around 20,000 animals), and further afield in Hudson Bay and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. While somewhat rarer in the Labrador Sea—especially since the 1950s— some sightings still take place. Additionally, pods of orca are drawn to the sea by the large shoals of fish, as well as the many marine mammal species they may hunt (including other cetaceans and pinnipeds), such as harbour porpoise and Atlantic white-sided, common, striped and white-beaked dolphins.

The sea is also a feeding-ground for Atlantic salmon. Shrimp fisheries began in 1978, intensifying by 2000, in addition to cod fishing. However, by the 1990s, the cod fishing had already depleted the fishes&#x27; population near the Labrador and West Greenland banks, and was therefore halted in 1992. Other fishery targets include haddock, Atlantic herring, lobster, several species of flatfish, and pelagic fish, such as sand lance and capelin. They are most abundant in the southern parts of the sea.
The Labrador duck was a common bird on the Canadian coast until the 19th century, but is now extinct. Other coastal animals include the Labrador wolf (&quot;Canis lupus labradorius&quot;), woodland caribou (&quot;Rangifer tarandus caribou&quot;), moose (&quot;Alces alces&quot;), black bear (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;), Canada lynx (&quot;Lynx canadensis&quot;), red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), Arctic fox (&quot;Alopex lagopus&quot;), wolverine (&quot;G. gulo&quot;), American mink (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;), North American river otter (&quot;Lontra canadensis&quot;), snowshoe hare (&quot;Lepus americanus&quot;), grouse (&quot;Dendragapus&quot; spp.), osprey (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;), raven (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;), ducks, geese, swans, partridge and pheasant. Occasionally, coastal polar bear (&quot;Ursus maritimus&quot;) sightings occur along the sea, mainly further north but sometimes as far south as Conception Bay and the mouth of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.

==Flora==
Coastal vegetation includes black spruce (&quot;Picea mariana&quot;), tamarack, white spruce (&quot;P. glauca&quot;), dwarf birch (&quot;Betula&quot; spp.), aspen, willow (&quot;Salix&quot; spp.), ericaceous shrubs (&quot;Ericaceae&quot;), cottongrass (&quot;Eriophorum&quot; spp.), sedge (&quot;Carex&quot; spp.), lichens and moss. Evergreen bushes of Labrador tea, which is used to make herbal teas, are common in the area, both on the Greenland and Canadian coasts.

<doc id="610373" wikidata="Q11085604" url="?curid=610373" title="Priscilla and Aquila">
<text>Priscilla and Aquila were a first-century Christian missionary married couple described in the New Testament. Aquila is traditionally listed among the Seventy Disciples. They lived, worked, and traveled with the Apostle Paul, who described them as his &quot;fellow workers in Christ Jesus&quot; ().

Priscilla and Aquila are described in the New Testament as providing a presence that strengthened the early Christian churches. Paul was generous in his recognition and acknowledgment of his indebtedness to them (). Together, they are credited with instructing Apollos, a major evangelist of the first century, and &quot;[explaining] to him the way of God more accurately&quot; ().

It is thought by some to be possible, in light of her apparent prominence, that Priscilla held the office of presbyter. She also is thought by some to be the anonymous author of the Epistle to the Hebrews.

== New Testament references==

They are mentioned six times in four different books of the New Testament, always named as a couple and never individually. Of those six references, Aquila&#x27;s name is mentioned first only twice: and one of the times on account of it being Paul&#x27;s first encounter with them, probably through Aquila first.

# : &quot;There he became acquainted with a Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who had recently arrived from Italy with his wife, Priscilla. They had left Italy when Claudius Caesar deported all Jews from Rome. Paul lived and worked with them, for they were tentmakers just as he was.&quot;
# : &quot;Paul stayed in Corinth for some time after that, then said good-bye to the brothers and sisters and went to nearby Cenchrea. There he shaved his head according to Jewish custom, marking the end of a vow. Then he set sail for Syria, taking Priscilla and Aquila with him.&quot;
# : &quot;When Priscilla and Aquila heard him preaching in the synagogue, they took him aside and explained the way of God even more accurately.&quot;
# : &quot;Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, my co-workers in the ministry of Christ Jesus.&quot;
# : &quot;The churches here in the province of Asia send greetings in the Lord, as do Aquila and Priscilla and all the others who gather in their home for church meetings.&quot;
# : &quot;Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila and those living in the household of Onesiphorus.&quot;
Note: This is not KJV; in the KJV, Acts 18:26 lists their names as &quot;Aquila and Priscilla&quot; making the count three and three.

== The couple ==
Priscilla and Aquila were tentmakers as was Paul. Priscilla and Aquila had been among the Jews expelled from Rome by the Roman Emperor Claudius in the year 49 as written by Suetonius. They ended up in Corinth. Paul lived with Priscilla and Aquila for approximately 18 months. Then the couple started out to accompany Paul when he proceeded to Syria, but stopped at Ephesus in the Roman province of Asia, now part of modern Turkey.

In , Paul passes on the greetings of Priscilla and Aquila to their friends in Corinth, indicating that the couple were in his company. Paul founded the church in Corinth. His including them in his greetings implies that Priscilla and Aquila were also involved in the founding of that church. Since 1 Corinthians discusses a crisis deriving from a conflict between the followers of Apollos and the &quot;followers of Cephas&quot; (possibly the apostle Peter), it can be inferred that Apollos accompanied Priscilla and Aquila when they returned to Corinth. This happened before 54, when Claudius died and the expulsion of the Jews from Rome was lifted.

In , thought to have been written in 56 or 57, Paul sends his greetings to Priscilla and Aquila and proclaims that both of them &quot;risked their necks&quot; to save Paul&#x27;s life.

Tradition reports that Aquila and Priscilla were martyred together.

===Priscilla===

Priscilla was a woman of Jewish heritage and one of the earliest known Christian converts who lived in Rome. Her name is a Roman diminutive for &quot;Prisca&quot; which was her formal name. She is often thought to have been the first example of a female preacher or teacher in early church history. Coupled with her husband, she was a celebrated missionary, and a friend and co-worker of Paul.

While the view is not widely held among scholars, some scholars have suggested that Priscilla was the author of the Book of Hebrews. Although acclaimed for its artistry, originality, and literary excellence, it is one of the few books in the New Testament with author anonymity (along with the Gospels and Acts). Hoppin and others suggest that Priscilla was the author, but that her name was omitted either to suppress its female authorship, or to protect the letter itself from suppression.

She is the only Priscilla named in the New Testament. The fact that she is always mentioned with her husband, Aquila, disambiguates her from different women revered as saints in Catholicism, Orthodoxy and Lutheranism, such as (1) Priscilla of the Roman Glabrio family, the wife of Quintus Cornelius Pudens, who according to some traditions hosted St. Peter circa AD 42, and (2) a third-century virgin martyr named Priscilla and also called Prisca.

===Aquila===

Aquila, husband of Priscilla, was originally from Pontus and also was a Jewish Christian. According to church tradition, Aquila did not dwell long in Rome: the Apostle Paul is said to have made him a bishop in Asia Minor. The &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot; identify Aquila, along with Nicetas, as the first bishops of Asia Minor (7.46).

==Significance==
This couple were among the earliest known Christian missionaries in the first century. In , Luke reports the couple explaining Jesus&#x27; baptism to Apollos, an important Jewish-Christian evangelist in Ephesus. Paul indicates Apollos is an apostle, an &quot;eloquent speaker&quot; who had a &quot;thorough knowledge of the Scriptures&quot;. He had been &quot;instructed in the way of the Lord&quot; which he taught with great &quot;enthusiasm&quot;. He began to preach boldly in the synagogue. However, he knew only the baptism of John the Baptist—not the baptism taught by Jesus. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained the Way of God to him &quot;more accurately&quot;.

Amongst churches today, this passage is often held in perceived tension with 1 Timothy 2:12–14, in which the author, Paul, writes, &quot;I do not permit a woman to teach or have authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.&quot; Opponents of female pastorship cite his reference to Adam and Eve to be indicating that the issue is a matter of universal gender propriety. On the other hand, Catherine and Richard Kroeger have written:
The fact is that women did indeed teach men, that women served as leaders, and that in doing so they enjoyed God’s blessing and won the praise of other believers. Priscilla instructed the learned Apollos, Lois and Eunice taught Timothy, and Phoebe is named as an overseer and a deacon in the church at Cenchrea. Furthermore, believers are enjoined to teach and to learn from one another, without reference to gender.

Advocates of female pastorship perceive this as an imperative that was a reflection of cultural and legal restrictions of the day. They cite , where Paul writes &quot;Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman; for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God&quot; and his affirmation of Priscilla&#x27;s instruction of the prominent evangelist Apollos as evidence that Paul was acceding to the law and customs of his day.

===Chronology===
The appearance of the two in the Acts of the Apostles helps to provide a chronological synchronism for the chronology of Paul&#x27;s life. According to , before Paul meets them in Corinth, they were part of a group of Jews whom the Emperor Claudius ordered expelled from Rome; if this edict of the Emperor can be dated, then we would be able to infer when Paul arrived in Corinth.

The evidence of other ancient sources points to two possible periods during the reign of Claudius: either during his first regnal year (AD 41; so Dio Cassius, &quot;Roman History&quot; 60.6.6), or during his nexpulsion took place: some, like Jerome Murphy-O&#x27;Connor, argue for the earlier year, while others, like Joseph Fitzmyer, argue for the later year.

==Veneration==
Priscilla and Aquila are regarded as saints in most Christian churches that canonize saints. In the Catholic Church, the Roman Martyrology lists their feast as July 8. Most churches in The Anglican Communion follow suit. The Greek Orthodox Church and the Antiochian Orthodox Church commemorate them together on February 13. 
The Greek Orthodox Church recognizes Aquila separately as an apostle on July 14.

<text>Benedictine College is a private Benedictine liberal arts college in Atchison, Kansas, United States. It was established in 1971 by the merger of St. Benedict&#x27;s College (founded 1858) for men and Mount St. Scholastica College (founded 1923) for women.

Benedictine is one of a number of U.S. Benedictine colleges and is sponsored by St. Benedict&#x27;s Abbey and Mount St. Scholastica Monastery. The abbey has a current population of 53 monks, while the Mount monastery numbers 147 community members.

==History==
Benedictine College celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2008. The present-day college was formed in 1971 by the merger of St. Benedict&#x27;s College, a men&#x27;s college, and Mount St. Scholastica College, a women&#x27;s college.
At the request of John Baptist Miège, Vicar Apostolic of Leavenworth, two Benedictine monks arrived in Atchison from Doniphan and opened St. Benedict&#x27;s College, a boarding school, in 1858. It was named for Benedict of Nursia, founder of modern western monasticism. The mainly classical school curriculum was intended to prepare students for the priesthood. The monks, who had recently arrived in the Kansas Territory, then moved their community to Atchison and founded the present-day St. Benedict&#x27;s Abbey. It expanded to include commerce subjects to cater to the needs of the local population, which was primarily pioneers and settlers. Over the years the college continued to expand and by 1927 it was an accredited four-year liberal arts college.

In 1863, the Benedictine Sisters of Mount St. Scholastica, whose namesake is Benedict of Nursia&#x27;s twin sister Scholastica, arrived in Atchison and founded St. Scholastica&#x27;s Academy (now Maur Hill – Mount Academy) for local young women. In 1924, Mount St. Scholastica&#x27;s Junior College was opened so these young women could continue their tertiary education. It became a senior college in 1932 and was authorized to confer bachelor degrees.

In 1970, Alcuin Hemmen, president of St. Benedict&#x27;s College, announced that St. Benedict&#x27;s would become a co-educational college. Mary Noel Walter, president of Mount St. Scholastica College, had been proposing a merger of the two colleges for over a year. Following Alcuin&#x27;s announcement, Walter organized discussion of a merger. It was agreed upon, and the universities merged on July 1, 1971, to form the current Benedictine College. The separate colleges&#x27; corporations remain in existence for scholarships and land ownership purposes and allowed the newly formed college a free 50-year lease of the separate colleges&#x27; facilities on their campuses. Benedictine College terminated the lease of the facilities from Mount St. Scholastica College on October 1, 1989, amidst financial hardship. It continues to lease property from St. Benedict&#x27;s College.

===Presidents===
* Mary Noel Walter (Acting, July 1, 1971, to February 12, 1972)
* Gerard Senecal (February 12, 1972 to May 29, 1987)
* Katherine Delaney (Acting, May 29, 1987, to 1988)
* Thomas O. James (1988 to 1995)
* Daniel J. Carey (1995 to 2003)
* Stephen D. Minnis (2004 to present)

==Academics==
The most popular majors at Benedictine are Business, Education, and Theology. Commerce, teaching, and the faith are historically significant interests of both the college and the Benedictine order.

The School of Business offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees and an MBA degree. Similarly, the Education Department offers undergraduate licensure programs and a Master of Arts.

The college&#x27;s theology department grew out of St. Benedict&#x27;s Abbey School of Theology and is the result of a 2007 shift from a Religious Studies program to a Catholic Theology program. All Theology professors are to have signed the canon-law mandatum as implemented by the U.S. bishops, and to take the oath of fidelity. The National Catholic Register&#x27;s &quot;Catholic Identity College Guide&quot; notes that the president has made a public profession of faith and taken the oath of fidelity; the majority of the board of trustees are Catholic and the school&#x27;s mandatum requirement is public. According to the Cardinal Newman Society&#x27;s &quot;The Newman Guide to Choosing a Catholic College&quot; guide, the theology department shares the college&#x27;s institutional commitment to the magisterium of the Catholic Church.

In 2010, Benedictine College added an Engineering Department in which students earn ABET-accredited degrees. The following year, the college added a nursing program dedicated to Mother Teresa of Calcutta who once visited Mount St. Scholastica in Atchison. The college&#x27;s architecture major, stressing classical styles, debuted in 2016.

The college&#x27;s Discovery Program gives students the opportunity to create and present original projects in any discipline. In 2010, Discovery Day included 80 presentations featuring the works of 145 students, 40 faculty/staff members, and 18 academic departments; &quot;more than 1800 students have participated in Benedictine’s Discovery Day events since its inception in 1996. In that time, most faculty members and academic departments have taken an active role in sponsoring student projects.&quot;

===Performing arts===
The college offers programs in the performing arts, including theatre, dance, and music. The college features two performance spaces: the Mabee Theatre seats approximately 130 and the O&#x27;Malley-McAllister Auditorium seats around 545 people. The Abbey Church and St. Scholastica chapel at Mount St. Scholastica Monastery are also utilized for organ recitals, orchestra, and choral performances.

The college&#x27;s music department traces its roots to Mount St. Scholastica Academy, now Maur Hill - Mount Academy, when in 1863 the Benedictine sisters were said to have first purchased a house and then a piano. The music department of the college was one of the first cooperative departments between the former two colleges, having been formed in 1964.

==Faith life==
Mass is offered to students three times daily in several places, including St. Benedict&#x27;s Abbey in its Abbey Church, St. Benedict&#x27;s Church (a parish connected to one of the campus dorms, Elizabeth Hall), and Guadalupe chapel (located in the Abbey Crypt under the main church). The Fellowship of Catholic University Students (FOCUS), a Catholic collegiate leadership apostolate, was founded at Benedictine College by Curtis Martin. Other active religious groups on campus include Communion and Liberation, Pax Christi, Ravens Respect Life, Partners in Prayer (in conjunction with Mount St. Scholastica), Great Adventure Bible Timeline, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Households and Varsity Catholic.

The college hosts pilgrimages to Rome and the Holy Land as well as local pilgrimage sites.

Campus worship opportunities including Life of Prayer, adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, traditional Catholic processions and Guadalupe Day. Many students participate in perpetual adoration at St. Benedict&#x27;s Parish on the edge of campus. The Chaplet of Divine Mercy is recited weekly. A daily rosary was added at the campus grotto to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Marian apparitions at Fatima. The president leads the rosary weekly in the chapel.

Students are invited to pray the Divine Office with the monks in St. Benedict&#x27;s Abbey or the sisters of Mount St. Scholastica Monastery. Lectio Divina is also offered at the Mount.

There are several places of prayer on or adjacent to campus: St. Martin&#x27;s Chapel, St. Benedict&#x27;s Abbey Church, Outdoor Stations of the Cross, Guadalupe Chapel, and St. Joseph Chapel in the Abbey. Retreats, conferences, and performances that college ministry offers to students includes &quot;Jam for the Lamb,” and BC Koinonia.

The school built &quot;Mary&#x27;s Grotto&quot;, located in the center of campus, and Archbishop Joseph Naumann dedicated it in 2009. It is one of three outdoor devotional spaces dedicated to Mary located on the campus. The grotto is the site of the May Crowning &quot;send-off&quot; of student vocations to the priesthood and religious life. The college is located within the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas, though it is not operated by the Archdiocese.

In 2014, the school renamed its student union the St. John Paul II Student Center on the day of Canonization of Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II.

==Campus==

It is located on bluffs overlooking the Missouri River.

==Athletics==
The Benedictine athletic teams are called the Ravens. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Heart of America Athletic Conference (HAAC) since the 1991–92 academic year. The Ravens previously competed as an NAIA Independent from 1962–63 to 1990–91; in the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (CIC) from 1937–38 to 1961–62; as an Independent from January 1929 (during the 1928–29 school year) to 1936–37; and in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference (KCAC) from 1902–03 to 1927–28.

Benedictine competes in 20 intercollegiate varsity sports. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, lacrosse, soccer, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor), and wrestling; women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, softball, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor), and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cheerleading, dance, and spirit squad.

Benedictine&#x27;s cheerleading and spirit squads have been recognized nationally. They also have an athletics band.

===Mascot===

The mascot &quot;Rocky the Raven&quot; is associated with St. Benedict, as legend has it a raven would bring the sixth-century saint food during his time as a hermit in the mountains near Subiaco, Italy. The legend also has the raven saving St. Benedict from eating poisoned bread.

<text>Jeremy James Anthony Gibson-Beadle MBE (12 April 1948 – 30 January 2008) was an English television and radio presenter, writer and producer. From the 1980s to the late 1990s he was a regular face on British television, and in two years appeared in 50 weeks of the year.

==Early life==
Beadle was born in Hackney, east London, on 12 April 1948. His father, a Fleet Street sports reporter, abandoned Jeremy&#x27;s mother, Marji (9 July 1921 – 4 July 2004), when he learned that she was pregnant. His mother worked as a secretary, including a stint for the boxing promoter Jack Solomons.

Before Jeremy reached age two, he was frequently hospitalised and had undergone surgery for Poland syndrome, a rare disorder that stunted growth in his right hand.

Beadle did not enjoy school and was frequently in trouble. He was eventually expelled from Orpington County Secondary Boys&#x27; School. A teacher remarked, &quot;Beadle, you waffle like a champion but know nothing.&quot;

==Early career==
After his expulsion, he travelled and worked in Europe. He held many jobs, including photographer of topless models, sky-diving instructor, lavatory attendant, tour guide and briefly as a tour guide at the York dungeons. He often said that he gave the best London tour because he realised that what people wanted was stories of blood, sex and death.

Beadle was chosen in 1970 by Tony Elliott, the founder of &quot;Time Out&quot;, to set up a Manchester edition of the magazine, a venture that was short-lived, though he subsequently maintained a connection with the publication in London. In 1972, North West Arts Association asked him to organise the Bickershaw Festival, and he worked on further musical events over the next couple of years.

In 1973, as an early member of the Campaign for Real Ale, he was elected to their National Executive and secured the campaign&#x27;s first television or radio coverage in a one-hour programme on BBC Radio London, which he hosted. During this period his talent for practical jokes became evident, although occasionally this rebounded on him, such as when colleagues left him naked in front of 400 women arriving for their shift. He then started writing for radio and television to provide material for stars such as Sir Terry Wogan, Michael Aspel, Noel Edmonds and Kenny Everett.

==Later public life==

===Radio and television===
Beadle began supplying odd facts and questions to radio and television game shows, such as &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot;. He sent a number of questions to Bob Monkhouse, the host, without the answers and Monkhouse was so impressed he rang Jeremy to ask him to work on the show. His presenting style on the phone-in programme &quot;Nightline&quot; on LBC in London, which he hosted between September 1979 and 22 June 1980 (when he was sacked), led to a cult following. He introduced himself as Jeremy James Anthony Gibson-Beadlebum: &quot;Jeremy James Anthony Gibson-Beadle is my name and a bum is what I am,&quot; he explained.

On 31 May 1980, he began co-presenting the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Fun Factory&quot; with his LBC co-star Thérèse Birch, Kevin Day and Billy Boyle. On Capital Radio Beadle presented &quot;Beadle&#x27;s Odditarium&quot;, a music show concentrating on strange, bizarre and rare recordings all taken from the archives of producer Phil Swern. From 5 October 1986, Beadle presented &quot;Beadle&#x27;s Brainbusters&quot; on the independent local radio network, with questions written by Beadle and Paul Donnelley. He also became renowned for his off-air pranks and intellectually challenging quizzes. He wrote, devised and presented many television pilots for the highly successful game show company Action Time, then run by Jeremy Fox, the son of Paul Fox. Beadle wrote and presented &quot;The Deceivers&quot;, a BBC2 television series recounting the history of swindlers and hoaxers. The success of this led to using the same format for &quot;Eureka&quot;, which told the background behind everyday inventions. He hosted a US game show pilot in 1985 called &quot;Family Follies&quot;, which did not make it to a full series.

Beadle then went on to become nationally famous as one of the presenters of LWT&#x27;s &quot;Game for a Laugh&quot;, the first programme made by ITV to beat the BBC&#x27;s shows in the Saturday night ratings battle. This was followed by a hidden-camera style practical joke show, &quot;Beadle&#x27;s About&quot; (1986–1996), which became the world&#x27;s longest continuously running hidden-camera show.

From 1990 to 1997, Beadle presented &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Framed!&quot;, a family show featuring humorous clips from viewers&#x27; home video recordings. An offshoot of this was &quot;Beadle&#x27;s Hotshots&quot;, featuring viewers&#x27; intentionally funny parodies and sketches, some of which were re-edited and even reshot by a young Edgar Wright in his first industry job; other sketches and scripts were produced by writer/director Chris Barfoot. In total, Beadle hit the UK Number One ratings slot four times.

In 1995, reflecting his days on LBC, he presented a relatively short-lived but popular Sunday late-evening show on the newly launched Talk Radio UK. As well as his considerable television output as writer, presenter and producer, he appeared in numerous pantomimes and acted as ringmaster for many circuses, notably for Gerry Cottle&#x27;s. He also worked as a consultant for many television companies, wrote books, and presented quizzes both commercially and for charity. As a radio presenter, he chaired a brief revival of &quot;Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?&quot; on BBC Radio 4. In 2007 he started to work on the Bickershaw Festival 40th Anniversary Boxed set project for 2012 in conjunction with Chris Hewitt, who had worked with Beadle on the original event in 1972. (Chris Hewitt continued to work on the project after Beadle died.)

Beadle was living in Highgate, north London, when he was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on 26 January 1994. He was surprised by Michael Aspel during a school carol concert at a church in nearby Hampstead on 8 December 1993.

===Writing===
Beadle wanted to be the British Robert L. Ripley. A love of trivia was born when his mother bought him &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot; for Christmas when he was a small boy. This led him to write &quot;Today&#x27;s the Day&quot; (published in the UK by WH Allen in 1979 and by Signet in the United States two years later), researched in his own library of 27,000 volumes. The book recounts – for any given day of the year – around half a dozen notable births, deaths or events that occurred on that date, linked to odd or amusing facts. Beadle briefly performed a similar duty on television&#x27;s TV-am, informing each morning&#x27;s viewers of prominent events on this date in past years. The scripts were written by Beadle and Paul Donnelley. The format was briefly revived when GMTV replaced TV-am as the ITV breakfast franchise in 1993.

For more than two years Beadle wrote a daily cartoon series of &quot;Today&#x27;s the Day&quot; for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. He worked alongside Irving Wallace and his son David Wallechinsky and daughter Amy Wallace as the biggest contributor to the sex and death chapters of &quot;The Book of Lists&quot; and was the London editor of &quot;The People&#x27;s Almanac 2&quot;. The Wallaces&#x27; book &quot;The Intimate Sex Lives of Famous People&quot; (Dell (US) Hutchinson (UK), 1981) was researched in part in Beadle&#x27;s library, which contained an extensive collection of erotic literature.

In autumn 2007, three new books by Beadle were published: &quot;Firsts, Lasts &amp; Onlys: Crime&quot;, &quot;Firsts, Lasts &amp; Onlys: Military&quot; (both co-authored by the celebrated writer Ian Harrison) and &quot;Beadle&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;, the first hundred quizzes from his weekly puzzlers in &quot;The Independent&quot;. He guest-edited the January 2008 edition of &quot;True Detective&quot;, which featured contributions from his friends who are crime experts including James Morton, Paul Donnelley, Andrew Rose and Matthew Spicer.

In 1995, Beadle wrote the foreword to &quot;Who Was Jack the Ripper?&quot;, a collection of theories and observations about the Victorian serial murderer, published by the veteran true crime book dealer Camille Woolf. It included contributions from experts such as Martin Fido, Colin Wilson, Donald Rumbelow, Colin Kendell and Richard Whittington-Egan. In his foreword, Beadle coined the collective noun to describe those interested in the subject &quot;a speculation of Ripperologists&quot;.

===General knowledge===
Renowned for his general knowledge, Beadle was host of &quot;Win Beadle&#x27;s Money&quot;, based on the US format &quot;Win Ben Stein&#x27;s Money&quot;. Beadle lost his money only eight times in 52 shows. He also wrote a quiz for &quot;The Independent&quot; every Saturday. He occasionally appeared as a panellist on Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Quote... Unquote&quot; and in dictionary corner for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Countdown&quot;.

Beadle was also a winner on the game show &quot;19 Keys&quot;, presented by Richard Bacon, defeating Nick Weir, Nicholas Parsons and fellow &quot;Game for a Laugh&quot; presenter Henry Kelly.

===Charity work===
An estimate of Beadle&#x27;s total charitable fund raising is around £100 million.

In the 2001 New Year Honours Beadle was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his services to charity. He was a keen supporter of the charity Children With Leukaemia, a disease he suffered from himself in 2005. He helped raise money for charities with Plastermind, his &quot;outrageous quiz for those who don&#x27;t like quizzes&quot;, as well as a school video venture called CamClass.

Beadle was a patron of The Philip Green Memorial Trust, and he hosted an annual quiz party to raise money for disadvantaged children. Beadle was also the patron of Reach, an organisation providing support and advice for children in the UK with hand or arm deficiencies, and their parents.

He was a Freemason, initiated in the Westminster City Council Lodge No. 2882, under the United Grand Lodge of England. Although he did not join until after his television heyday was over, he quickly became involved with all aspects of English Freemasonry, and particularly its charitable work, often using his celebrity status to assist in raising funds for Masonic charities.

===Health and disability===
Beadle had Poland syndrome, which manifested itself as a disproportionately small right hand. In 2004, Beadle was diagnosed with kidney cancer and underwent a successful operation to remove it. In April 2005, a blood test during a routine post-op medical check-up led to his being diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. 

==Death==

On 25 January 2008, it was reported that Beadle had been admitted to a north London hospital, and was subsequently placed in a critical care unit with pneumonia. He died on 30 January 2008 at the age of 59. His body was subsequently cremated at Marylebone Crematorium on 14 February 2008, and the ashes were buried in a grave at Highgate Cemetery, the distinctive headstone reflecting his bibliophile inclination with a stack of sculpted stone tomes, with the inscription: &quot;Writer, Presenter, Curator of Oddities&quot;.

==Tributes==
On 2 February 2008, ITV dedicated that day&#x27;s episode of &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Framed&quot; to Beadle and promoted a tribute webpage to him over the show&#x27;s credits. The channel&#x27;s official tribute to Jeremy Beadle was broadcast on 4 February 2008 where various celebrity friends including Alan Sugar paid tribute.

A further tribute was aired on Friday 16 May, &quot;An Audience Without Jeremy Beadle&quot;, hosted by Chris Tarrant and with contributions from Alan Sugar, Henry Kelly, Ken Campbell and Anneka Rice.

His obituary in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; claimed that he &quot;was the most avidly watched presenter on television&quot;. On 15 August 2010 he was the subject of an ITV documentary, &quot;The Unforgettable Jeremy Beadle&quot;.

<text>The Missouri River Trench is the geological name applied to the broad valley of the Missouri River as it flows southward through North Dakota and South Dakota in the United States.

The valley averages approximately wide, with the valley floor averaging between below the surrounding bluffs. The valley was extensively dammed between 1946 and 1966 to provide a series of reservoirs in the Dakotas. Geologically, the valley separates the main plateau of the Great Plains to the west from the Missouri Coteau to the east.

Although cultivation has added markedly to the sediment in the river as it flows through the valley, the water was turbid even before the widespread introduction of agriculture, according to early European travellers. Erosion and deposition are believed to be in equilibrium in the trench. Siltation now provides a major challenge for the impounded sections of the river in the valley.

<text>Kwik cricket (known as Kanga cricket in Australia, and Kiwi cricket in New Zealand)
is a high-speed version of cricket aimed mainly at encouraging children to take part in the sport, with an emphasis on participation and enjoyment.

==Rules==
Many of the rules are adapted from cricket, but kwik cricket is played with a lightweight plastic bat and ball (for safety reasons), and plastic cones to mark the maximum width of a legally bowled ball. The rules can be altered so that virtually any number of children can play in the time available, and the game can be made easier or more difficult by changing the physical dimensions of the pitch (changing the width of the wickets, increasing the distance between the wickets, widening or narrowing the crease, pulling in or pushing out the boundary, etc.).

A base set of rules published for the Australian &quot;Kanga Cricket&quot; version in the 1980s was:
* 1. Batters bat in pairs. Each pair gets a certain number of overs or deliveries (often set at two or four overs per pair), no matter how many times they&#x27;re out. There are no fours or sixes, batters have to keep running to add to their score. 
* 2. Each bowler can only bowl a certain number of overs, so that just about everyone gets a bowl. There are six balls in an over. The ball can bounce more than once, and wides and no balls are not re-bowled.
* 3. When one side has finished batting, the total number of runs they have scored is divided by the number of times they&#x27;ve been given out to give the team score.
* 4. The team with the highest team score is the winner. 
* 5. Each time a batter is out, batters change ends unless it happens to be the last ball of the over.
* 6. There is no Leg Before Wicket (LBW) dismissal.

8-a-side is a good format to ensure all participants get involved and have fun. This may also allow batters to face five or six overs per pair within a 60-minute game. An 8-a-side game also allows the fielding side a bowler, wicket-keeper and three fielders per side of the pitch.

<text>Utsjoki (; ; ; ; ) is a municipality in Finland, the northernmost in the country. It is in Lapland and borders Norway as well as the municipality of Inari. The municipality was founded in 1876. It has a population of 
() and covers an area of of
which 
is water. The population density is

Utsjoki has two official languages: Finnish and Northern Sami. It is the municipality in Finland with the largest portion of official Sami speakers; of the population.

The border with Norway follows the river Teno, which flows into the Arctic Sea. The northernmost village in Finland and in the European Union is Nuorgam, which is also the northernmost land border crossing in the world.

Utsjoki is at the northern end of highway 4, the longest highway in Finland. The European route E75 runs along the Sami Bridge and continues on to Norway.

The Kevo nature reserve is located within the municipality. It covers a territory of and there is a hiking trail. The trail partly follows the edge of the Kevo gorge.

&quot;The name Utsjoki comes from Northern Sami &quot;Ohcejohka&quot;, but the origin of that name is unknown&quot;, according to website Fennica.pohjoiseen.fi.

==Geography==

=== Villages ===
* Nuorgam
* Utsjoki centre
* Nuvvus
* Dalvadas
* Outakoski
* Rovisuvanto
* Karigasniemi
* Kaamasmukka

===Topography===
The Utsjoki region is flatter and lower in altitudes than many other parts of Lapland. Large areas of Utsjoki are less than 300 m above sea level. Many of the fell summits are under 500 m in height. In general, the topography is smooth and the fells slope gently. The summits are very flat and large, as is typical of old peneplain surfaces.

===Vegetation===
In general, the tree line is located at altitudes between 300 and 400 meters. In northernmost Finland, the tree line on north-facing slopes is just above an altitude of 100 meters. Heaths extend above the tree line. The lower heathlands are dominated by shrubs such as dwarf birch, blueberry and crowberry, whereas the fells, at higher elevations, have dwarf willows and alpine grasses with lichens and mosses. On the fell tops, blockfields and windblown heaths with lichens and mosses as well as bare rock slabs are found. Patterned ground occurs regularly, often as polygons and stone stripes on the slopes.

===Climate===
The midnight sun remains above the horizon from 17 May to 28 July (73 days), and the polar night from 26 November to 15 January (51 days).
Utsjoki, like most of Finland, has a subarctic climate (Köppen Dfc). Being the northernmost municipality in Finland, Utsjoki&#x27;s annual average temperature is below freezing. Utsjoki is also the driest place in Finland, as the average annual precipitation varies between 371 and 433 mm, depending on the topography. The driest year on record was 1986, when only 234 mm of precipitation fell at the Outakoski weather station.

Extremely low temperatures and low precipitation result in thin snow cover throughout the winters. The wind velocity strongly increases with higher elevations, and this has a major effect on the distribution of the snow. The exposed hilltops usually have no snow cover during winter. This leads to the cooling of the ground and the development of permafrost.

===Permafrost===
Palsas are a typical permafrost feature in northern Finland. Permafrost formation in palsas is dictated by the properties of peat. Dry peat is a good insulator during the summer heat, but frozen peat in winter conducts heat outwards, and the winter frost can penetrate deep into the peat layers. Due to these physical properties, palsas may be formed and preserved even in a climate where the mean annual air temperature is just at the freezing point.

Permafrost has been found in many palsa mires in the Kevo and Utsjoki regions. After detailed studies on palsas, researchers were convinced until 1982 that &quot;so far, permafrost has been found, and probably exists only, in mires in the cores of palsas&quot;. The permafrost core in palsas is easy to detect by digging or sounding with a steel rod, and the frozen ground necessitates modern geophysical techniques for geoelectrical soundings. They allow measurement of the thickness of frozen bedrock due to its higher specific electrical resistance.

Matti Seppälä (1941-2020) was undoubtedly the foremost expert on palsas. Based on existing innovative research in Scandinavia he suggested to look for the general permafrost distribution in the mountains also in northernmost Finland. The field campaign in summer 1985 in Utsjoki was supported by the Academy of Finland, the University of Helsinki and the German Research Foundation. The results were quite surprising for most scientists in Finland. Above the timber Iine a minimum permafrost thickness of ten to fifty meters was recorded with geoelectrical soundings.

It seems obvious that permafrost is widespread on fjell summits of northern Finland. The Puollamoaivi mountain (432 m high) is located some 13 km NE of the Kevo Subarctic Research Station. Close to the Skallovarri palsa mire about 290 m a. s. I., an estimated permafrost thickness of over 100 meters may be expected at an altitude of 360 m, just 30–70 m higher than the surface of the palsa mire. It is concluded therefore that all sites on the crest of Skallovarri (Puollamoaivi) show the existence of permafrost, but its thickness seems to be different. These findings were confirmed with similar results in the adjacent Peldojoki, Hietatievat, Peera sites, where permafrost exists in debris as well as in bedrock. This is also of importance in the construction business, e.g. for deep foundations for telecommunication masts.
